During the Taish≈ç period, parliamentary democracy based on party politics temporarily succeeded in Japan, but in the 1930s the political parties were eclipsed by the military, and were dissolved in the 1940s during World War II. Early movements Soon after the Meiji Restoration, various political associations arose. These included groups of disgruntled unemployed samurai seeking either to overthrow the government and return to the days of feudalism, or to invade Korea (see Seikanron), whereby their skills as warriors would be in demand again, These also included urban intellectuals and rural landowners who were part of the liberal Freedom and People's Rights Movement seeking a national assembly and written national constitution. Both groups were viewed with equal suspicion and disdain by the Meiji oligarchy, who reacted by imposing several repressive laws on public assembly, the press and on political discussion. The Meiji government had come to power by an elite of samurai from certain clans (hanbatsu) and the genr≈ç felt threatened by anything looking ever remotely like republicanism or democracy. During this period, Itagaki Taisuke and ≈åkuma Shigenobu were leading figures in the legitimization of political parties. Itagaki created Japan's first political party, the Aikoku K≈çt≈ç, in 1873 in Tokyo to petition for an elected assembly, and a similar regional party based in Osaka, the Aikokusha. These groups were the basis of the Jiyut≈ç (Liberal Party), founded in 1881 as Japan‚Äôs first nationally based party. ≈åkuma founded the Rikken Kaishint≈ç in 1882, mainly from the urban elites. In reaction, the oligarchs fought back by the creation of their own party the same year, the Rikken Teiseit≈ç. Meanwhile, the disgruntled former samurai vented their dissatisfaction at the state of affairs in a series of revolts, including the Saga Rebellion of 1872, and others, cumulating in the Satsuma Rebellion. After crushing these revolts by military force, the government also passed the Peace Preservation Law of 1887. The Meiji Constitution was issued two years later in 1889. Domination by the oligarchs The creation of the Diet of Japan in November 1890 was marked by intense rivalry between the genr≈ç, who reserved the right to appoint the Prime Minister and the members of the cabinets regardless of what the elected government wanted, and the political parties who were powerless because of their inability to unite and thus control the House of Representatives. The Rikken Kaishint≈ç gradually lost support, and was overtaken by the pro-oligarch until it was reformed as the Shimpot≈ç in 1896. None of the political parties, whether pro- or anti-oligarch, had any power in the House of Peers, nor did they have significant power in the countryside, as key local officials were appointed directly by the bureaucracy in Tokyo. Emergence of party government The Jiyut≈ç and the Shimpot≈ç united in 1898 against Prime Minister It≈ç Hirobumi's proposed new taxation plans, and formed the Kenseit≈ç, which emerged with a majority of seats in Diet in the subsequent election. It≈ç resigned, and was replaced by ≈åkuma Shigenobu, making the first time that a political party had assumed power. Although the ≈åkuma government collapsed within months, a precedent had been set. The Kenseit≈ç evolved into the Kenseit≈ç Hont≈ç, followed by the Rikken Kokumint≈ç in 1910. It≈ç Hirobumi joined into the fray, by organizing the Rikken Seiyukai in 1900 to combine elements from the former Jiyut≈ç with elements from the oligarchs and bureaucrats. The more conservative elements rallied around Katsura Taro, and his Rikken Doshikai, which was reconstituted as the Kenseikai in 1916. From 1922 onwards, politics was a rivalry between the Seiyukai and the Kenseikai, rather than political parties and oligarchs. During this period, a bewildering array of parties advocating socialism, Marxism or agrarianism appeared. All provoked hostility from the mainstream political parties, oligarchs and military alike, and many were either banned or went underground soon after formation. Following the successful Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the emergence of labor unions in Japan, the Nihon Shakai Shugi Domei (1920), Japan Communist Party (1922), and other left-wing parties emerged. Ascendancy of the military The main threat to representative democracy in Japan proved to be the Japanese military, rather than the left-wing parties. Under the Meiji Constitution, the Minister of the Army (who served as Minister of War) and Minister of the Navy were appointed by their respective services, and not by the Prime Minister. The military was also directly answerable only to the Emperor, and not to the elected government. In 1912, a law restricting the eligibility to Minister of the Army or Navy to active duty generals or admirals had the unforeseen effect of giving the military a trump card over the government when Prime Minister Uehara Yusaku resigned over failure of the Diet to pass his budget requesting funds for two additional army divisions. The Army's refusal to appoint a successor brought down the government. Taish≈ç democracy The military did not immediately utilize its prerogative to control the formation of the Cabinet, so in the Taish≈ç period, several administrations from 1918‚Äì1922 and 1924-1932 operated largely free from military intervention. In 1927, the Kenseikai reorganized itself as the Rikken Minseit≈ç, which from 1927 to 1932 alternated power with the Seiyukai. Prime Ministers continued to be chosen by genr≈ç Saionji Kinmochi (It≈ç Hirobumi‚Äôs prot√©g√©), but his choices during his period reflected political party strength in the Diet. These included the premiership of Hara Takashi, Takahashi Korekiyo, Kiyoura Keigo, Kat≈ç Takaaki, Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç, Tanaka Giichi, Hamaguchi Osachi, and Inukai Tsuyoshi. Sh≈çwa military rule The number of voters increased fourfold after the passage of universal male suffrage in 1925, and with the increase in expenses required for election, the influence of the zaibatsu on the political parties also increased. At the beginning of the Sh≈çwa era, this collusion between politicians and government officials, led to an increase in high-profile corruption scandals and increasing dissatisfaction with the elected government by the public in general and by the military in particular. Some military used this dissatisfaction to denounce the London Naval Treaty and promote a Sh≈çwa Restoration. The assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in the May 15 Incident (1932) at the hands of young Navy radicals proclaiming the need for political reform, started the rapid decline in the power and influence of the political party in Japan. After the assassination of Inukai, every subsequent Prime Minister was either from the military, or was someone with militaristic and/or ultranationalistic credentials. As the military influence on society increased towards the end of the 1930s, the Imperial General Headquarters launched a large scale invasion of China. Pressure then mounted from the military leadership for the remaining political parties to merge into a single organization, thus giving the government a single voice, referred to as Hakk≈ç ichiu (\\"eight crown cords, one roof\\"). This change to a one-party state was effected in 1940 under Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, when all remaining political parties joined the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.

Unlike Visa Electron or Maestro debit cards, Carte Bleue allowed transactions without requiring authorization from the cardholder's bank. In many situations, the card worked like a credit card but without fees for the cardholder. The system has now been integrated into a wider scheme called CB or carte bancaire (\\"banking card\\"). All Carte Bleue cards were part of CB, but not all CB cards were Carte Bleue. The system was national, and pure Carte Bleue cards did not operate outside France. However, it is possible and commonplace to get a CB Visa card that operates outside France. Carte Bleue was, technically speaking, the local Visa affiliate. Carte Bleue started in 1967, associating six French banks: BNP, CCF, Cr√©dit du Nord, CIC, Cr√©dit Lyonnais, and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. Combined Visa cards have existed since 1973 under the name Carte Bleue Internationale, changing to Carte Bleue Visa in 1976. From 1992 on, all Cartes Bleues / CB have been smart cards. When using a Carte Bleue at a French merchant, the PIN of the card must be used, and a microchip on the card verifies and authenticates the transaction. Only some very limited transactions, such as motorway tolls or parking fees, are paid without PIN. Since automatic teller machines also check for the PIN, this measure strongly reduces the incentive to steal Cartes Bleues, since the cards are essentially useless without the PIN (though one may try using the card number for mail-order or e-retailing). Foreign cards without microchips can still be used at French merchants if they accept them, with the usual procedure of swiping the magnetic stripe and signing the receipt. In 2000, Serge Humpich, after failing to convince the makers of a serious flaw he had found two years before, purchased some metro tickets to prove it. He sent the proof to Groupement des Cartes Bancaires. They then initiated criminal action against him, and he was convicted and sentenced to a ten months suspended jail sentence.Ingrand, Cedric (2000-02-26), \\"French credit card hacker convicted\\", The Register. https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/02/26/french_credit_card_hacker_convicted/Jessel, Stephen (2000-02-25), \\"Credit card whistleblower sentenced\\", BBC. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/657135.stmWebster, Paul (2000-01-22), \\"Banks fail to give credit to fake smart card 'genius'\\",The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/22/paulwebster In 2003, the Cartes Bleues / CB started to move on to the international standard EMV for smart chips, allowing for their use abroad. In 2010, the Carte Bleue brand was phased out in favour of Visa; however, the term carte bleue continues to be used as a generic term for EFT-based payment cards, including debit and credit cards.

Background and early life Perkins was born in Peterborough, the son of John Edward Sharman Perkins, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, and his wife Margaret Charlotte Long. His brother Christopher Perkins became a noted artist, and both boys were educated at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk. Frank attended Rugby School (1902‚Äì1904), Gresham's (1904‚Äì1907), and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, (1907‚Äì1910) gaining a pass degree in mechanical engineering in 1910. War service At the beginning of the First World War, Perkins quickly volunteered, and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, serving in its 34th divisional company in the Dardanelles, Palestine, and Egypt. He was demobilized in 1918 with the rank of major. Career He was a third generation engineer, following both his grandfather and father, who both worked for Barford & Perkins, a family firm that manufactured road construction rollers/compactors, agricultural rollers, and other agricultural machinery. However, before joining the family firm at its Queen Street ironworks in Peterborough, he worked for Lawes Chemicals Ltd. While later working at Aveling & Porter in Rochester, Kent, Perkins started working on a high-speed, light-weight, diesel engine with Charles Chapman. Before they could complete the project, Aveling & Porter went bankrupt. Convinced that the scheme would be profitable in serving the agricultural tractor market, the two formed their own company, F. Perkins Limited, on 7 June 1932, initially with four employees and based in a rented workshop. Chapman was the technical director and Perkins the chairman. Perkins would go on building new engines and building the company until 1959, when at the age of seventy he sold a majority stake to his largest customer, Massey Ferguson. He was president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (1956‚Äì57) and Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire (1956‚Äì57). He died at his home, Alwalton Hall, near Peterborough, in 1967. Family In 1915, while on leave from the Royal Engineers, Perkins married Susan Gwynneth Gee, the daughter of Hugh Roberts Williams. They had one son and three daughters.

The film was written by David S. Goyer while a student at USC, and was Goyer's first screenplay to be sold and produced commercially. In the film, the police detective Louis Burke is going into a prison facility at California as an undercover cop in order to find out who stands behind a mysterious series of murders, and finds himself locked up with his nemesis: Christian Naylor, a psychotic serial killer who calls himself \\"The Sandman\\" who sets out to exact revenge upon him after getting into prison. Death Warrant was released on September 14, 1990. Upon its release, the film grossed $46 million against production budget of only $6 million. The film received general mixed critical reaction from critics who found the direction, its storyline, villain, and the plot poor, but highly praised the acting as well as the action scenes and the thrilling atmosphere. Plot Detective Louis Burke (Jean-Claude van Damme) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from Quebec confronts the maniac that killed his partner on the force: an enigmatic psychopathic serial killer by the name of Christian Naylor (Patrick Kilpatrick), who calls himself \\"The Sandman\\". Burke searches an abandoned house in Los Angeles, where he comes across a series of bodies hanging from the ceiling, and is then attacked by the Sandman. Burke is able to shoot the Sandman several times in the center of his chest, apparently killing him. Sixteen months later, Burke joins a task force assembled by the governor to investigate a series of murders in the Harrison State Prison in California which is becoming a scandal threatening his reelection. While Burke poses as an inmate, attorney Amanda Beckett (Cynthia Gibb) acts as his wife. Burke goes undercover and is interned in the State penitentiary, where befriends his cellmate Konefke (Conrad Dunn) and a clerk, Hawkins (Robert Guillaume). Despite Burke saving Hawkins from a confrontation with a Mexican gang, neither he nor Konefke will talk about the recent murders. Burke is able to track down the cellmate of the most recent victim (named Barrett), who works at the infirmary, but the cellmate also refuses to talk. When Burke threatens him, he reveals that he doesn't know what's going on, but that the guards are involved and that there is an \\"outside man.\\" He sends Burke to talk to Priest (Abdul Salaam El Razzac), who gets him a key to the records room. In the records room, Burke finds Barrett's death certificate covered in codes. He feeds the codes to Beckett and connects her with a teenage hacker, Tisdale (Joshua John Miller), who determines the codes come from the infirmary. With help from Priest and Hawkins, Burke breaks into the infirmary and finds several boxes labeled \\"medical waste\\" that are actually full of human organs. Later, a new inmate arrives, and Burke is horrified to find that it's the Sandman, who did not die two years ago. The Sandman recognizes Burke and briefly apprehends him; instead of killing Burke, the Sandman reveals to their fellow prisoners that Burke is a cop. Meanwhile, Beckett and Tisdale are able to decipher a code they find in the computer, which comprises prisoner identification numbers followed by their blood type. None of the inmates on the list have drug-related crimes, and they are mostly young, first-time offenders. All of the ID numbers match those of prisoners who have been murdered. Burke identifies it as a \\"hit list\\", and realises that he's next. On the outside, Beckett then attends a party hosted by the state's attorney general, Tom Vogler (George Dickerson). Beckett believes that her boss, Ben Keane (Jack Bannon), is responsible for the murders, and prepares to tell Vogler of her theory. However, just as she is about to do so, she receives a call from Tisdale, who tells her that the man behind the murders is in fact Vogler. Vogler produces a gun and reveals to Beckett that his wife needed a liver transplant, and when it turned out that even his money and influence couldn't move her up the donor list in time, he created a conspiracy to murder healthy prisoners for organs. After his wife's transplant, he continued the scheme for profit. He also reveals that he sent the Sandman to assassinate Burke, because Burke was too hard for the other inmates to kill. When his wife unexpectedly enters the room, Beckett escapes. In the prison, Burke escapes his cell and the Sandman opens all the other cells to create a riot. Priest and Hawkins help him evade the guards; Hawkins is injured but saved by Priest, but Priest is then killed by the Sandman. The scene culminates in a showdown between Sandman and Burke with the inmates looking on. At first, the Sandman gets the better of the fight, but when he opens the door to the boiler room‚Äîproclaiming, \\"Welcome to hell!\\"‚ÄîBurke turns the tables by kicking the Sandman into the flames. This appears to be the end of the Sandman, but after some seconds, he emerges from the boiler, grossly burned. Burke kicks him again, this time sending him careering backward into a pillar, where his head is impaled on a valve stem. Despite this mortal injury, stuck to the valve, the Sandman continues to taunt Burke: \\"You can't kill me, Burke. I'm the Sandman.\\" Burke responds by twisting the Sandman's head around; the valve stem inflicts damage on the psychopath's brain, finally killing him. The inmates quietly allow Burke to leave the prison, where he is reunited with Hawkins and Beckett.

Located in a valley, Alotenango is a Ladino coffee center, since the times of general Justo Rufino Barrios liberal regime (1873-1885). History Volc√°n de Fuego summit as seen from the saddle that separates it from volc√°n Acatenango in 1899. Photograph by Alfred Percival Maudslay, who climbed the peak from Alotenango. According to the Popol Vuh, the town is mentioned as Vucuc Caquix. The community of Alotenango grew up originally 3 to 4 kilometers south of the current settlement which today is the Candelaria farm. This settlement was established before the Spanish arrived in Alotenango in 1524. In the 1540s, bishop Francisco Marroqu√≠n split the religious coverage of the Guatemala central valley between the Order of Preachers and the Franciscans, getting to the latter the Alotenango curato, among others. Given that there was not a separation of Church and State, the curato division was transferred into the geography of the valley; thus, the Alotenango valley was delimited by the Guatemala valley ‚Äî that is, Antigua Guatemala to the east, Chimaltenango valley to the north, and the Escuintla Province to the south and west. In 1881, French writer Eugenio Dussaussay climbed the volcano, then practically unexplored.

They wanted to climb the central peak, unexplored at the time, but could not find a guide and had to climb to the active cone, which had had a recent eruption in 1880. His guide, Rudecindo Zul, from Alotenango, was the only one to offer to help, but only to the saddle that divides Fuego from volc√°n Acatenango, as the townspeople feared and respected the mountain too much to go beyond that point. Archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay, in his book A Glimpse at Guatemala, tells about his expeditions to volc√°n de Fuego. The second one took place on 1 January 1892, from Alotenango, and he described it as follows: Culture The municipality is home to a Franciscan monastery and a large church. A large hut has been used as a courthouse; the sandy plaza holds a Sunday market. The residents, mainly Maya peoples, are notable for a highly particular local culture retaining elements from their ancient Maya society past while including elements from the dominant Hispanic culture as well. Most of the people are peasant Cakchiquel who once spoke only Cakchiquel but now mainly speak Spanish. Other historians believe the town is inhabited by descendants of Nahua speaking Pipils, an indigenous people who live in western El Salvador. However, in the Titulo de Alotenango, a 16th- century legal document, the land dispute claims were between the Cakchiquel of Alotenango and the Pipil of Escuintla. Married couples leave their patrilocal extended household only after several children are born. 24 June is a festival day in honor of Saint John the Baptist, the town's patron saint. Economy Under Anacaf√©, Alotenango is situated in the Antigua coffee region. The Capetillo farm was developed in the 18th century by Spanish Royal Treasurer Juan Antonio Capetillo. Formed from different lots totaling seven caballertas, it only grew sugar cane until 1875. The farm was purchased by Jose Mariano Rodriguez in 1875, and he began coffee cultivation. Revenue generation figures for that year were 2,800 pesos, increasing to 12,000 pesos in 1878. In 1880, there were 200,000 producing coffee trees, a mill, and 25,000 pesos of revenue. Capetillo coffee was awarded the only Grand Prize for Coffee at the 1915 Universal Exhibition. Climate Alotenango has a temperate climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cwb). Geographic location The town is the starting point for the ascent of Volc√°n de Agua which like most other places within the department looms above to the immediate east of the town. There is also a direct ascent available for Volc√°n de Fuego from Alotenango. National Highway 14 connects Alotenango to the cities of Antigua Guatemala in the north and Escuintla in the south.

According to the 2018 census, the town has a population of 32,802Citypopulation.de Population of cities & towns in Guatemala and the municipality a population of 33,405. Ciudad Vieja was the second site of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, the colonial capital of the country. San Miguel Escobar is the modern name for the district that contains the ruins of the second colonial capital of the Guatemala region. The Spaniards founded their capital here in 1527, after their previous capital at Tecp√°n Guatemala became untenable. The city was destroyed by a catastrophic lahar from Volcan de Agua in 1541, and the survivors had no choice but to abandon the site. Among the casualties was the governor Beatriz de la Cueva.  History  Volc√°n de Agua as seen from Ciudad Vieja in 2007. Jorge de Alvarado founded the second capital here for the Captaincy General of Guatemala in 1527; but, according to historian Domingo Juarros, there was already discrepancy on the exact location of the original placement of Ciudad Vieja back in 1818. In his book Compendio de la Historia de la Ciudad de Guatemala (English: Brief history of Guatemala City') he wrote: \\"But it is noteworthy, that the authors talk with variety on this matters: each one of them talks about this fact based on the system that one follows. [...] Thus, there is a group that says that the Spaniards set the city temporarily in Almolonga, and therefore, the attest to the fact that the City was on the location right to the East, in the place the natives call Tzacualpa, resulting in that the first Almolonga settlement ended up being a barrio in Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. [On the other hand, there is a group that says] that the Spaniards found the city on top of King's Sinacam old court, or Guatemala de los Indios, located in the actual Tzacualpa valley.\\" Either way, the Cabildo decided a permanent location for the city on the edge of the plain at the foot of the south-west slope of the Volc√°n de Agua; during the following year this new Santiago was declared to be the capital of the province, and began rapidly to rise in importance. Juarros described that the settlement could not develop because fourteen years after its foundation it was ruined by a \\"formidable landslide that came down Volc√°n de Agua on 11 September 1541; the mudslide brought along heavy rocks that destroyed part of the buildings and damaged the rest\\". The city was destroyed and the survivors had no direction, since governor Beatriz de la Cueva died during the disaster, which took place shortly after her husband, Adelantado Pedro de Alvarado, died and she was appointed governor by the Ayuntamiento (English:City Hall). Beatriz de la Cueva had been beside herself with grief and on 9 September 1541, when she had signed the Cabildo documents, she did so as \\"la sin ventura\\" (English: the hapless one), a phrase that turned out to be prophetic. Those who survived requested Francisco de la Cueva to gather the Adelantado stick that belonged to his late sister and declared themselves on permanent session on 17 and 18 September 1541, finally appointing bishop Francisco Marroqu√≠n and Francisco de la Cueva himself as interim governors. On 27 September 1541, a commission formed by two auxiliary majors and eleven civilians set out to inspect the surrounding areas and advice on the best location to move the capital city to; the returned after two days, declaring that Tianguecillo Valley was the place to go, and the Cabildo (English: City Hall) issued a decree for everybody to move there. However, before they started to move, engineer Juan Bautista Antonelli, city and villa builder, arrived and recommended to move the city to Panchoy Valley for the following reasons: \\"there the danger from the volcanos is removed, as they will never be able to flood it, it is guarded at North by the hills that surround it; has plenty of water, with it starting at the top of the hills and then coming down to the valley, and can be tubed and distributed everywhere easily; that land is flat, and it would be easy to build plazas, streets and houses; and so large, that no matter how big the city becomes, it will have up to eight of nine leagues around\\". In 1895 Anne Cary Maudslay and her husband, archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay visited the Antigua Guatemala region as part of a journey through Guatemala's Maya and colonial archeological monuments, and climb the Volc√°n de Agua; she wrote a book called A glimpse at Guatemala where she explains that water from the volcano crater could not have destroyed the old Santiago: \\"The cause of this catastrophe is usually said to have been the bursting of the side of a lake which had been formed in the crater of the extinct Volc√°n de Agua; but an examination of the crater shows this explanation to be improbable, as the break in the crater-wall is in an opposite direction, and no water flowing from it could have reached the town. Moreover, there is no evidence to show that the deeper portion of the crater, which is still intact, has held water since the reported outbreak. Indeed, an accumulation of water during the exceptionally heavy rain, through some temporary obstruction in one of the deep worn gullies which indent the beautiful slope of that great mountain, and a subsequent landslip would probably account for the damage done without the aid of either an eruption of water from the crater or the supernatural appearances which are duly noted by the old chroniclers.\\" In Literature Guatemalan writer and historian Jos√© Milla y Vidaurre wrote his novel La hija del Adelantado using historical elements from the months leading to the destruction of Ciudad Vieja.

It has seven zones, two villages, and one hamlet. According to the 2018 census, the municipality has a total population of 21,657 of which 1,680 are native population and the balance are non-indigenous; and approximately 19,280 live in an urban area, while the balance are rural dwellers. Jocotenango is the birthplace of multi Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter Ricardo Arjona. History Jocotenango was initially an agricultural field, set up after the Spanish conquest by Adelantado, Pedro de Alvarado, as it was specified in his will, which read: \\"Called the lords and principals of the town that he had assigned to him, and ask that each one of them give him a certain number of families, and with them he created that settlement; he freed them and donated to them their land; and as the first natives who gathered there were from Utatl√°n, the town was called Utateca\\". So was founded the Santiago Utateca settlement. After the destruction of the old kingdom capital on 11 September 1541, the city was moved to Panchoy valley, and the k'achik'eles decided to follow the Spaniards and settled next to Santiago Utateca, founding Jocotonango; eventually both town combined. In the 1540, bishop Francisco Marroqu√≠n split the religious administration of the Guatemalan central valley between the Order of Preachers and the franciscans, assigned the formet the Jocotenango curato, among others. After the destruction of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala by the Santa Marta earthquake in 1773, the city moved, this time to La Ermita valley. the old neighborhoods followed suit, among them: Jocotenango, Almolonga, San Pedro, San Gaspas and Nuestra Se√±ora de Guatemala. Thus, there was a second Jocotenango settlement next to the new Guatemala City, which was eventually swallowed by the metropolis and is part of the modern Zone 2. The old Jocotenango, previously considered a suburb, received municipality status in the middle of the 19th century. Geography It is in size and is situated above sea level. Cerro El Nariz√≥n (\\"Big Nose Mountain\\"), one of the peaks of the El Rejon range is nearby, reaching an elevation of . Hydrographic features include the Rio Guacalate, streams, and a creek. Jocotenango is located in a mountainous rain forest in a sub-tropical region. According to the 2003 Ministerio de Agricultura (English:Secretary of Agriculture) report, approximately 93 hectares are used for agriculture, while 75 hectares are in forest. Deposits of Placedr√≠n Andesite have been found here. Vulnerability to natural disaster is evidenced by severe erosion to the Rio Guacalate basin, forest fires, accelerated deforestation, and floods. Slope sediment, along with poor soil management, is most visible in the villages of La Rinconada and Vista Hermosa. An annual threat to the populated areas is flooding during periods of rainfall. It requires the municipality to clear hundreds of cubic meters of sediment that accumulates in the streets. This type of erosion causes loss of productive soil capacity, exposure of basement rock, and generation of landslides and mudslides. The average rainfall is 1344 mm/year while the temperature varies between 16 and 23 ¬∞C. Flora and fauna The forest coverage rate is important for town's socioeconomics. Most of the wooded area, is located on the hill Panza de Burro and near the municipal yard. Flora includes species of oak, cypress, and palo de jiote (Bursera simaruba). The fauna is associated with crops that predominate the area such as agouti, coyote, mouse opossum, rabbit, squirrels, white-tailed deer, and gophers. Birds include, hummingbird, quail, hawk, and dove. Culture The red brick Jocotenango Church lies in the town. La Azotea (\\"roof\\") Cultural Center features, built on an ancient coffee estate, has three museums. Casa K‚Äôojom (\\"House of K'ojom\\"), a music museum, features traditional Maya musical instruments such as diatomic harp, drums, flutes, marimbas, ocarinas, and whistles. Masks, paintings, traditional costumes and crafts are also exhibited. The Museo del Caf√© (\\"Museum of Coffee\\") is dedicated to the history and evolution of coffee cultivation. Coffee beans are displayed in varying stages of production, antique equipment can be viewed, and as it is situated at an actual plantation, on-site tours are available. There is also a small costume museum. Its main festival is celebrated each year during the week of August 8.

History = Doctrine of Order of Preachers = Order of Preachers coat of arms. After the conquest, the Spanish crown focused on the Catholic indoctrination of the natives. Human settlements founded by royal missionaries in the New World were called \\"Indian doctrines\\" or simply \\"doctrines\\". Originally, friars had only temporary missions: teach the Catholic faith to the natives, and then transfer the settlements to secular parishes, just like the ones that existed in Spain at the time; the friars were supposed to teach Spanish and Catholicism to the natives. And when the natives were ready, they could start living in parishes and contribute with mandatory tithing, just like the people in Spain. But this plan never materialized, mainly because the Spanish crown lost control of the regular orders as soon as their friars set course to America. Shielded by their apostolic privileges granted to convert natives into Catholicism, the missionaries only responded to their order local authorities, and never to that of the Spanish government or the secular bishops. The orders local authorities, in turn, only dealt with their own order and not with the Spanish crown. Once a doctrine had been established, the protected their own economic interests, even against those of the King and thus, the doctrines became Indian towns that remains unaltered for the rest of the Spanish colony. The doctrines were founded at the friars discretion, given that they were completely at liberty to settle communities provided the main purpose was to eventually transfer it as a secular parish which would be tithing of the bishop. In reality, what happened was that the doctrines grew uncontrollably and were never transferred to any secular parish; they formed around the place where the friars had their monastery and from there, they would go out to preach to settlements that belong to the doctrine and were called \\"annexes\\", \\"visits\\" or \\"visit towns\\". Therefore, the doctrines had three main characteristics: # they were independent from external controls (both ecclesiastical and civilian ) # were run by a group of friars # had a relatively larger number of annexes. The main characteristic of the doctrines was that they were run by a group of friars, because it made sure that the community system would continue without any issue when one of the members died. In 1638, the Order of Preachers split their large doctrines ‚Äîwhich meant large economic benefits for them‚Äî in groups centered on each one of their six monasteries, and the San Lucas Sacatep√©quez doctrine was moved under the Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala monastery jurisdiction: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" width=28% - style=\\"color:white;\\" !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" align=centerMonastery !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" align=centerDoctrines - !style=\\"background:lemonchiffon;\\"Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala  * Chimaltenango * Jocotenango * Sumpango * San Juan Sacatep√©quez * San Pedro Sacatep√©quez * Santiago Sacatep√©quez * Rabinal * San Mart√≠n Jilotepeque * Escuintla * Milpas Altas * Milpas Bajas * San Lucas Sacatep√©quez * Barrio de Santo Domingo } Geographic location See also * Chajoma * Sacatep√©quez Department Notes and references  =References= =Bibliography= * Category:Municipalities of the Sacatep√©quez Department ","title":"San Lucas Sacatep√©quez"},{"id":"2350537","text":"San Miguel Due√±as is a town and municipality in the Guatemalan department of Sacatep√©quez.

History  The Melanesian Brotherhood was formed in 1925 by Ini Kopuria, a policeman from Maravovo, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. He and the Bishop of Melanesia, the Right Reverend John Manwaring Steward, realised Ini's dream by forming a band of brothers (known in the Mota language as 'Ira Reta Tasiu') to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the non-Christian areas of Melanesia. The Brothers (or 'Tasiu', as they are more generally known in the islands) were responsible for the evangelisation of large areas of Guadalcanal, Malaita, Temotu, and other areas in the Solomons, for Big Bay and other places in Vanuatu, and the Popondetta area of Papua New Guinea.  Structure  After training for three years, a novice is admitted as a brother by the Archbishop of Melanesia in his capacity as Father of the Brotherhood, or his deputy, or the Regional Father, who is a diocesan Bishop in his role as a Regional Father of the Brotherhood. This admission usually takes place on the Sunday nearest the feast of St. Simon & St. Jude (28 October) at one of the three regional headquarters. The Head Brother is the leader of the whole Brotherhood and is based at The Mother House at Tabalia. Tabalia is the place given by Ini Kopuria on northwest Guadalcanal. Three regional Head Brothers assist the Head Brother, and work supervising the Brothers' ministry in the three regions of Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, based at Popondetta, and at Tumsisiro, on east Ambae, Vanuatu. Each of the three regional centres supervises the life and mission of the brothers in Sections (which are coterminate with the dioceses of the Church of Melanesia). The Sections are led by a Section Elder Brother. Under the Sections are the Households, which are led by an Elder Brother, and under the Households are relatively small communities of 3 to 6 brothers in Working Households, who are led by a Brother-in-Charge. Below the Working Households are Mobile Households with no full-time Brothers. Mobile Households have two or more Brothers, and may develop into Working Households. Each Mobile Household, Working Household, Section, Region, and the entire Brotherhood has its own chaplain, responsible for the daily celebration of Mass and the spiritual lives of the Brothers in his care. He may or may not be a member of the Brotherhood.  Daily cycle and vows  The Brothers follow a sixfold cycle of daily office and Eucharist consisting of First Office (Prime), Morning Prayer, Mass, Morning Office (Terce), Midday Office (Sext), Afternoon Office (None), Evening Prayer, and Last Office (Compline). The text for Morning Prayer, the Eucharist, and Evening Prayer are from the Melanesian English Prayer Book, or its authorised alternatives, the lesser hours are simple offices in the \\"cathedral office\\" tradition rather than monastic, and the devotion of the Angelus (or Regina Coeli) is prayed daily. The Brothers follow the evangelical counsels under the vows of poverty, celibacy and obedience. They spend three year as novices and then take vows for terms of five years, which are renewable . The constitution of the brotherhood permits some brothers to take life vows, but most brothers serve from seven to twenty years and are released. The released brother go back into the world, usually finds a wife, and resumes life as a Christian layman in his village. Several brothers, however, and many more former brothers are ordained to the diaconate or the priesthood. Although called the Melanesian Brotherhood, there are many Brothers who are from Polynesian islands, and several Filipinos and Europeans have joined the community.  Peace-making  Icon of the Melanesian Martyrs at Canterbury CathedralDuring the \\"ethnic tension\\" of 1999-2000 in the Solomon Islands, the Brotherhood participated in peace-making efforts which led to a ceasefire and to the Townsville Peace Agreement of October 2000. They then gathered weapons from combatants and discarded them at sea. One rebel leader, Harold Keke, did not comply with the agreement and continued to cause trouble. Brother Nathaniel Sado, who knew Keke, went to reason with him, but did not return. On 23 April 2003, six brothers went to investigate reports that Keke had murdered Br. Nathaniel, and they did not return either. Scanty reports indicated that Keke was holding them hostage, but on 8 August 2003, the Police Commissioner was able to inform the Brotherhood that all six were dead. Keke and his men surrendered several days later, and the bodies of the seven brothers were exhumed and brought back to Honiara for autopsy. Br. Nathaniel had been tortured for several days before dying, three of the others had been shot on arrival and the remaining three had been tortured and shot the next day. The bodies were interred at Tabalia on 24 October 2003. On 20 February 2004, Prime Minister of Fiji, Laisenia Qarase presented the Brotherhood with the first prize in the regional category of the 4th Pacific Human Rights Awards \\"for its sacrifice above the call of duty to protect the vulnerable and build peace and security in Solomon Islands during the civil conflict and post-conflict reconstruction\\". On 3 August 2008, the seven martyred members of the Anglican Melanesian Brotherhood were honoured during the concluding Mass of the Lambeth Conference, at Canterbury Cathedral. Their names were added to the book of contemporary martyrs and placed, along with an icon on the altar of the Chapel of Saints of Our Times. When the Eucharist was over, bishops and others came to pray in front of the small altar in the chapel. Now their icon stands at the Cathedral as a reminder of their witness to peace and of the multi-ethnic character of Global Anglicanism. Other activities Annelin Eriksen and Knut Rio suggest that the Melanesian Brotherhood is \\"dedicated to sorting out spiritual, demonic, and sorcery-related problems.\\" They note that the brothers \\"wear black robes as uniforms\\" and \\"have a powerful walking stick that is highly respected and widely reputed to perform miracles.\\"Annelin Eriksen and Knut Rio, \\"Demons, Devils, and Witches in Pentecostal Port Vila: On Changing Cosmologies of Evil in Melanesia,\\" in Pentecostalism and Witchcraft: Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia, p. 194.

Spanish and Kaqchikel are spoken in this town. History Volcan de Agua as seen from Santa Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s in 1895. Photograph by Alfred Percival Maudslay. There was no mention of it prior to the sixteenth century. One of the most important activities performed during the Hispanic period in this township was bringing ice gathered from the summit of Volcan de Agua to the city of Santiago. The central square has a temple built in the seventeenth century with a carved entry arch. In January 1881, archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay arrived to Santa Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s to climb the Agua, which he died on foot from the villa, but unfortunately for him, once he reached the summit he could not take pictures as he had planned because the region was overcast and only the other volcanoes summits were visible. He returned on New Year's Day in 1892 and this time he was able to take the pictures from several places on the volcano. Finally, in 1895, Maudslay went back for a third and last time, this time along with his wife, Anne Cary Maudslay, who wrote her adventure from a Victorian perspective in the book A glimpse at Guatemala. This time the climbing was of approximately 1600 m from Santa Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s, where they had spent the night; they rode on mules from Antigua Guatemala to Santa Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s while the quietness was only broken ever now and then by the bell tolling of nearby villages. Anne Maudslay described her experience as follows: ¬´Passing through a miserably dirty village street, we entered by a pretentious gate into the great bare plaza. A huge ugly church faced us, and to the left stretched the long low cabildo. The other two sides of the plaza were intended to be closed in by high walls, and by the gateway through which we had entered; but these were additions which the Indian mind clearly deemed superfluous, for the gateway was without a gate, half the west wall had fallen down, and the south wall had not been built. Outside this great square the town was almost wholly composed of tratch-roofed native huts¬ª. Anne Maudslay continues: \\"The life of the village centered round the fountain which stood in the middle of the plaza. Here party after party of women with babies slung on their backs or astride on their hips, and strings of children running at their heels, came to fill their \\"tinajas\\" and carry home the water for the night's consumption\\". Native women's physical attributes did not impress Maudslay, but their discipline did: \\"They were sober and could attend to their household duties, whilst the men almost without exception were drunk with chicha\\". Folklore Among the folk dances presented in this municipality are the dance of \\"The Deer\\" and \\"Micos\\".

Name origin The native term Xenacoj has been evolving over the centuries: in 1625, Irish friar Thomas Gage, call it Sinacao; later, friar Francisco Ximenes, O.P. in 1717, calls it Xencoc. In the San Pedro documents is shown as Senacoc and in 1806 was written as Xinac√≥, in 1880 as Xinac√≥ and, finally, in the early 20th century is written as Xenacoj. The origin of the name comes from the word \\"Xe\\" which means under or beneath and Nacoj, which is the name of a hill; therefore, the name Xenacoj means \\"under the Nacoj hill\\". Another version claims that instead of Hill, Na means mouth and Coj means lion. History Santo Domingo Xenacoj is located in a valley that the Spanish conquistadores called \\"de Sacatep√©quez\\" (English: Valle of Sacatep√©quez) in the 1520s. That valley was bordered by the valley of Xilotepeque on the West, those of Mixco and las Vacas on the North, and by the Chiquimula province and the South and East. The town was described as having \\"warm climate\\" by Irish friar Thomas Gage in his 1648 book about his travels through America in the 1620s and 1630s.

History Allenheads Heritage Centre The settlement was founded around lead mining. The first mine to open in the area was in the 1880s. It soon became a leading lead mines in the Northern Dales. However, within two decades of opening, it was closed in 1896 devastating the local community. In 1970s, the mine was briefly reopened by British Steel Corporation as the Beaumont Mine in the 1970s to extract Fluorspar. Section on Allenheads (Beaumont) Mine. However, the venture was not a success as it proved cheaper to source the Fluorite elsewhere. The local economy is now dependent on agriculture and tourism. The village currently has a caf√©, a contemporary Arts centre, and inn. An industrial heritage centre chronicling the local mining industry has a preserved Armstrong Whitworth hydraulic engine which was located in the mine's sawmill. It is now located in a purpose made exhibition hall in the village centre. Several hydraulic engines - built by the engineering firm started by William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong of Elswick, Tyne and Wear- were installed at the mine. Drawings of these other machines have been conserved. In October 2017 the North Pennines Observatory was opened at the village's Old School House.

Prior to the wreck of , it is also known as Waenhuiskrans, an Afrikaans name meaning literally \\"Wagon house cliff\\", after a local sea cave large enough to accommodate a wagon and a span of oxen. Wreck of Arniston In May 1815, a British East Indiaman, Arniston, was rounding the Cape in convoy on a journey to repatriate wounded British soldiers from Ceylon. The ship lacked a chronometer ‚Äì an expensive instrument at the time ‚Äì and consequently had to rely on other ships in the fleet to calculate the longitude of the group. After being separated from the convoy in heavy seas, the captain of Arniston was obliged to rely solely on dead reckoning to navigate. Thinking incorrectly that he was west of the Cape of Good Hope, the master steered north for St Helena and ran the ship onto the rocks at Waenhuiskrans. Only six of the 378 people on board survived the wrecking. The survivors spent several days on the beach before being discovered by a farmer's son. A memorial, a replica of which can be seen today, was erected on the beach by the wife of Colonel Giels, whose four unaccompanied children were lost in the tragedy. The memorial bears the following inscription: Over the years, the name of the wreck has become synonymous with the name of the location and today the labels 'Arniston' and 'Waenhuiskrans' are used interchangeably. Today At first only a fishing community, Arniston has become a holiday destination and its hinterland a region for viticulture. The fishing village, characterized by its lime-washed and thatched houses, remains unspoiled and has been declared a national monument in its entirety. Fishermen still go to sea in boats of the style that would have been familiar to locals in the early nineteenth century, although now under contract to larger commercial enterprises. Whale watching is a popular tourist activity. The Arniston Hotel is a popular tourist destination that looks out over the ocean. The closest major town is Bredasdorp, to the north. The Overberg Test Range is situated adjacent to the town.

King George V King Edward VIII; Prince Albert, Duke of York; Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent, took guard on 27 January 1936 at the lying-in-state of their father, George V. (A fifth son, Prince John, had predeceased his father in 1919). The vigil took place after Westminster Hall was closed to the public for the evening. No photographic record of this event is known, though an oil painting made of it later by Frank Beresford was the official painting of the King's lying-in-state; it was exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1936 at Burlington House. The painting, named The Princes' Vigil: 12.15am, January 28, 1936, was subsequently purchased by George V's widow Queen Mary to give to their son Edward VIII on his birthday.Frank Beresford: Derby artist painted royalty - bygonederbyshire.co.uk In the painting, the King is depicted wearing the uniform of the Grenadier Guards, of whom he was the Colonel-in-Chief, the Duke of Gloucester wears the full dress uniform of the 10th Royal Hussars (the regiment in which he served), while the Duke of Kent is in Ceremonial Day Dress uniform of the Royal Navy. The Duke of York is unseen fully in the painting, although at the end of the catafalque opposite the King is a figure in full Foot Guards uniform; at this point in time, the Duke of York served as Colonel of the Regiment of the Scots Guards. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Charles, Prince of Wales; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex; and David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley, took guard at 16:40 UTC on 8 April 2002 at the lying-in-state of their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (widow of King George VI; daughter-in-law of King George V). The four relieved the guard of the Royal Company of Archers, and were themselves relieved by the Yeomen of the Guard after their twenty-minute vigil. Both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York wore naval uniform, while the Earl of Wessex and Lord Linley wore black morning dress; the Earl of Wessex served in the Royal Marines, but chose to leave before completing basic training, while Lord Linley (now styled Earl of Snowdon) has never served in the forces. Present during the Changing of the Guard were the Prince of Wales' two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. In the future Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh have four children, Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. They have four grandsons and four granddaughters. The official plans for the Queen's funeral, Operation London Bridge, call for the Queen's children to stand vigil over their mother's coffin, as well for the grandsons and granddaughters to do the same.

It lies on both banks of the Tundzha river in the historical region of Thrace. It is occasionally spelled Jambol. Yambol is the administrative center of two municipalities.

The ancient Thracian royal city of Kabile or Kabyle (), dating from the end of the 2nd millennium BCE, was located 10 km from current-day Yambol. It was one of Thracians' most important cities and contained one of the kings' palaces. The city was conquered by King Philip II of Macedon in 341 BCE and was re-established as an Ancient Greek polis.An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen,2005,Index - Founded by Phillip IIFol, Aleksandar.

After the collapse of Alexander the Great‚Äôs empire in the 3rd century BCE, Kabile was ruled by the Thracians once again. It was conquered by the Romans in 71 BCE and later incorporated into the Roman province of Thrace. By 136 CE, Kabile was one of the largest Roman military bases in the region housing at least 600 soldiers. A large residence for military officers has recently been excavated in the archaeological park at Kabile.Archaeologists Find Roman Military Officers‚Äô Residence (Tribunorium) in Ancient Thracian City Kabile near Bulgaria‚Äôs Yambol: http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2017/11/14/archaeologists-find-roman- military-officers-residence-tribunorium-ancient-thracian-city-kabile-near- bulgarias-yambol/ Kabile was expanded by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293 CE. Although it was named Diospolis (ŒîŒπœåœÇœÄœåŒªŒπœÇ in Greek 'city of Zeus'), the name also reflected the first syllable of emperor Diocletian's name. The name later evolved through Diampolis (ŒîŒπŒ¨ŒºœÄœåŒªŒπœÇ), Hiambouli (ŒóŒπŒ¨ŒºŒ≤œåœÖŒªŒπ; in Byzantine chronicles), Dinibouli (ÿØŸÜÿ®ŸÑŸä; Arabic chronicles), Dbilin (–î–±–∏–ª–∏–Ω; in Bulgarian inscriptions), and Diamboli or Jamboli (–î–∏–∞–º–±–æ—é–ª–∏) to become Yambol. Kabile was conquered by the Goths in the 4th century CE and was destroyed by the Avars in 583. As the Slavs and Bulgars arrived in the Balkans in the Middle Ages, the Kabile fortress was contested by the First Bulgarian Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. It ultimately became part of Bulgaria in 705 CE during the reign of Khan Tervel and has been an important Bulgarian center ever since. The city expanded during the reign of Khan Omurtag of the First Bulgarian Empire, and a new fortress was built. Its proximity to the border made it essential for both trade and military purposes. During the reign of Boris I and Tsar Simeon, the first literary centers were established, mostly as part of the church. Books were imported from Preslav and Ohrid literary schools and were studied in the city's churches. During the reign of Tsar Kaloyan, the city again increased in importance, mainly due to the ongoing conflict between Bulgaria and the crusaders. A major battle between Tsar Kaloyan and the crusaders happened in 1204 CE, about 80 kilometers south-west of the town, where Bulgaria defeated the crusaders in the battle of Adrianopole on 14 April 1205. The ottomans conquered Yambol in 1373 CE, but a militarized, semi-independent Bulgarian population remained as voyinuks in the southern part of the city.–î—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ç–∞ –æ–±—Å–∞–¥–∞ –Ω–∞ –Ø–º–±–æ–ª—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∫—Ä–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç, —Å—Ç—Ä. 24 It was renamed to \\"Yanbolu\\".

The predominant religion in Yambol is Orthodox Christianity. Many local churches were erected in 1888. These include the Holy Trinity church, the St George church, and the St Nicholas cathedral, the largest of them being the St. Nicholas cathedral. Eastern Rite Catholic and Protestant religious buildings also exist in Yambol. In modern times, Yambol was the center of Yambol Okolia starting in 1878 and then Yambol Okrug starting in 1948. In 1984 it became part of the newly formed Burgas Oblast where it remained for 10 years. Since the early 1990s, Yambol has been the center of Yambol Oblast (or Yambol Municipality). The city was affected by the turmoils of the early 20th century. Bulgarian refugees from East Thrace, attacked by the Turkish Army in an 1913 ethnic cleansing campaign against Thracian Bulgarians, settled in the city. Yambol's Greek population (around 20 families) left for Greece during that exchange of refugee populations. Yambol also hosted Bulgarian Macedonian refugees from the failed 1903 Ilinden Uprising. During World War I, Yambol hosted a base for Luftstreitkr√§fte (Imperial German Army Air Service) zeppelins used for missions in Romania, Russia, Sudan and Malta. The city was chosen by the Germans due to its favorable location and weather conditions. During the Balkan Wars, Yambol was the headquarters of the First Bulgarian Army, which played a vital role in the defeat of the Turks in Trace. In the early 21st century, the city became the first one in Bulgaria to offer natural gas for residential use.  Population  In the first decade after the liberation of Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire, the population of Yambol exceeded 10,000. In 1887, it was 11,241. Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of migrants from rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns. Yambol's population reached its peak in the period of 1985-1992, exceeding 90,000. After this peak, the population started decreasing due to the economic situation in Bulgaria during the 1990s, which led to migration to the capital, Sofia, and abroad. As of February 2011, the city had a population of 74,132 residents. The population of Tundzha Municipality, of which the city is the administrative center, was 98,287.  Economy  Local industry has declined since the 1990s with many factories closing down. The city is the centre of its thriving agricultural surroundings. =Ethnic, linguistic, and religious composition= According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows: *Bulgarians: 59,899 (87.1%) *Gypsies: 4,263 (6.2%) *Turks: 3,185 (4.6%) *Others: 296 (0.4%) *Indefinable: 1,101 (1.6%) **Undeclared: 11,718 (8.5%) Total: 74,132 Climate The climate in Yambol is moderate with influences from both the Black Sea (from the East) and the Aegean Sea (from the South).

His divorce from his first wife caused much comment, partly because it was thought to have political implications. Life He was born at Boughton, Northamptonshire, the son of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland, and Frances Montagu. His maternal grandparents were Sir Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton, and his wife Elizabeth Jeffries. He was styled Lord Roos from 1641 until 1679. He had six sisters, all of whom married into the nobility. Dorothy became Countess of Shaftesbury; Grace became Viscountess Chaworth; Margaret became countess of Salisbury; Elizabeth became Countess of Anglesey; Anne became Viscountess Howe, and Frances became Countess of Exeter. He served, rather passively, as Member of Parliament for Leicestershire from 1661 until 1679. Politically he was a Whig, but did not attend court after 1689, preferring the life of a country magnate. Lord Roos succeeded his father as Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire in 1677, and proved an effective deputy of the crown. His invitation to Lord Sherard to stand with him for Leicestershire instead of a gentry candidate upset the Leicestershire gentry, and the Commons disallowed Roos' election. He was created Baron Manners of Haddon on 30 April 1679 and sent to the House of Lords instead, but succeeded as Earl of Rutland on 29 September 1679 at the death of his father. He retained his lord lieutenancy in 1681, despite supporting the Exclusion Bill, but was turned out by James II in 1687. During the events leading to the Glorious Revolution, Rutland received the then Princess Anne at Belvoir Castle on her flight from London late in 1688. Reappointed by William in 1689, he resigned in 1702, to protest government promotion of Tory interests in Leicestershire. He was briefly Custos Rotulorum of Leicestershire thereafter (22 August 170222 March 1703). On 29 March 1703, his long support of Whig government was rewarded by his creation as Duke of Rutland and Marquess of Granby. Rutland was reappointed to the lord lieutenancy in 1706, which he retained until his death on 10 January 1711. Ancestry This table sets out the ancestry of John Manners for six generations, numbered according to the Ahnentafel genealogical numbering system. Family He married firstly his second cousin (they were second cousins and also second cousins once removed), Lady Anne Pierrepont, daughter of Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, and Cecilia Bayning, on 15 July 1658. The failure of their marriage attracted considerable public attention, as divorce was not generally available at the time. He obtained a \\"separation from bed and board\\" in 1663 on grounds of her adultery, and private Acts of Parliament in 1667 bastardizing her issue since 1659 and granting him permission to remarry in 1670. This process required considerable expenditure and trouble. It also caused a series of quarrels with his hot- tempered father-in-law, who on one occasion challenged him to a duel. The divorce proceedings aroused enormous public interest and had some political significance since among the regular attenders in the House of Lords was King Charles II of England himself. By his own account he was only there for the entertainment, saying that he found the debates \\"as good as a play\\"; but there was a rumour that the King intended to use the divorce as a precedent for divorcing his own childless Queen, Catherine of Braganza. In the event the rumour came to nothing, although the King, who now saw Parliamentary debates as a useful guide to the opinions of the ruling class, began to attend the House of Lords regularly. Peers became accustomed to \\"speaking to the fireside\\" (i.e. addressing themselves directly to the King, who, to indicate that he was only present as an observer, usually sat by the fire). He married, secondly, Lady Diana Bruce, daughter of Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin, and Lady Diana Grey, on 10 November 1671. She died on 15 July 1672 in childbirth. He married, thirdly, Catherine Wriothesley Noel (died 1733), daughter of Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden, on 8 January 1673. They had three children: *John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland (1676‚Äì1721) *Lady Catherine Manners (1675‚Äì1722), married John Leveson-Gower, 1st Baron Gower, and had issue. *Lady Dorothy Manners (c. 1690‚Äì1734), married Baptist Noel, 3rd Earl of Gainsborough, and had issue.

During the late 1990s, manufacture of the type had commenced; by 2008, Alstom had reportedly sold 1,750 Prima locomotives. In 2009, the second generation Prima II was launched. During 2013, the Prima H3 diesel/battery hybrid locomotive was launched. First generation SNCF BB 27308 locomotive, a variant of the first generation Prima model A pair of Prima locomotives During 1998, the French national railway operator, SNCF, placed a large order with train manufacturer Alstom for 120 electric locomotives, which was later on increased to 240, to perform both domestic and international freight services. The company decided to develop a new modular platform that would accommodate the requirements not only of the existing SNCF order, but to also comply with European interoperability standards, as well as a high degree of flexibility as to meet the divergent needs of different operators, potentially increasing the type's international appeal. In this manner, the SNCF order can be attributed with the extension of the Prima locomotive range. The design of the electric models visibly shows a level of familiarity with the diesel-electric members of the family. In 2002, Alstom constructed a single Prima demonstrator for the purpose of investigating modular solutions for the configuration of onboard equipment, cab, traction and other systems. During the following year, another Prima demonstrator, known as the multi-system Prima 6000, was built; this was originally to demonstrate to the SNCB what Alstom could produce for them; it was later used as a test platform for the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and for as the new Prime II concept before being withdrawn in 2009.\\"The Prima platform.\\" railcolor.net, Retrieved: 20 May 2018. ;Electric locomotives * SNCF Class BB 27000 * SNCF Class BB 27300 * SNCF Class BB 37000 * SNCF Class BB 47000 * Prima Class E 37500 * China Railways HXD2 ;Diesel locomotives * SNCF Class BB 75000 * Sri Lanka Railways M9 Second generation ONCFM E 1400 locomotive, a variant of the second generation Prima model On 20 May 2008, Alstom announced the details of a second generation of Prima locomotives, named \\"Prima II\\". The prototype was unveiled on 3 June 2009 at Alstom's Belfort plant.\\"Alstom unveils the Prima II prototype, its new generation locomotive.\\" Alstom, 3 June 2009. The locomotives are designed to be modular and reconfigurable to suit customers requirements throughout their lifetimes. Electric versions can work with up to four different overhead line voltages; 1.5 Kv and 3 kV DC, as well as 15 KV and 25 kV AC; it possesses power ratings of up to , and operating speeds of . The design also accommodates for broader gauge versions, suitable for use in Russia, India and Finland, which have been reportedly viewed by Alstom's sales department as potential markets for the Prima II. Compatibility with the ERTMS signalling system for European cross border operations is also a feature.

The first order for the second generation Prima II came from Morocco's national railway ONCFM, with an order in November 2007 for twenty electric locomotives. These are due to be delivered in the second half of 2009 for entry into passenger and freight service in 2010. The Moroccan locomotives are to be initially delivered for 3 kV DC operation, with the potential to install a transformer and other electrical equipment for 25 kV AC operation at a later date when Moroccan electrification upgrade schemes take place. ONCFM placed a follow-up order for 30 locomotives in February 2018. During November 2015, Alstom received a Letter of Award from the Ministry of Indian Railways to supply Indian Railways with 800 double section freight electric locomotives in class WAG-12, along with associated long-term maintenance. The total contract, which is worth in excess of ‚Ç¨3 billion, shall also involve the establishment of a new assembly plant at Madhepura, in Bihar state, as well as two maintenance depots at Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh state and Nagpur, Maharashtra state.

The Prima H3 is a diesel/battery hybrid locomotive, intended mainly for use as a shunter. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid shunting locomotive in daily use; it is an initiative of the Eco Rail Innovation (ERI) and is being supported by a total of 19 companies.\\"[DE] Official presentation: The H3 hybrid shunting locomotives of DB Regio Franken.\\" railcolornews.com, 1 December 2016. Financing for the project includes ‚Ç¨600,000 ($653,560 approximately) from the State of Bavaria. It was first publicly unveiled at InnoTrans 2014 in Berlin.\\"H3 Hybrid Shunting Locomotive Project.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 20 May 2018. Alstom's Stendal site in Scaxony-Anhalt, Germany, is responsible for manufacturing the locomotives. The H3 locomotive is 12.8 meters long, 3.13 meters wide and 67 tonnes in weight. It has a maximum axle load of 22.5 t, can handle a minimum curve radius of 60 meters, and has a starting tractive effort of 240 kN. The design incorporates an integrated flexicoil suspension system and a hydraulic bogie coupling system, the latter being designed and supplied by Liebherr. The hybrid locomotive is designed for an operation lifespan of up to 40 years and has been certified for a maximum speed of 100 km/h on mainline railways.\\"Prima H3 shunting loco approved for 100 km/.\\" Rail Gazette, 5 April 2017. These speeds allow the type to operate within short-distance mainline traffic without causing undue disruption. Several different models have been developed, including the H3 Battery 600 kW electric locomotive, the H3 Hybrid 700 kW hybrid locomotive, the H3 Dual Engine 700 kW dual engine locomotive, and the H3 Single Engine 1,000 kW single-engine locomotive. The H3 Battery model is provisioned with eight separate batteries which provide up to 600 kW, while the H3 Hybrid is instead equipped with a 350 kW generator and a 350 kW battery. The H3 Dual Engine variant is fitted with a pair of 350 kW diesel engine generators, and the H3 Single Engine features a 1,000 kW diesel engine. The latter three variants are each equipped with a 2,000 l fuel tank, while no fuel tank is present on the battery-only model. The first two H3 variants are designed to perform shunting operations in industrial areas and tunnels, while the third variant is designed for mainline services and industrial uses, and the fourth variant is designed for mainline services and heavy shunting operations. In common operational practice, the locomotive initially runs on batteries alone; when not in active use, it is plugged in during breaks for recharging. When required, the batteries are charged via a small diesel engine driving a generator; only when the battery voltage is no longer sufficient to move the vehicles does the diesel generator automatically power up to recharge the batteries or to provide additional power. This diesel engine is rated at 350 kW and is Stage IIIB compliant; it produced lower emissions, as well as a considerable reduction in noise, in comparison to conventional diesel traction. According to Laug, Director of Production at DB Regio Franken in N√ºrnberg, the emissions are reduced by 70 per cent, while fuel consumption has also been cut by 50 per cent less to the traditional shunting locomotives, saving only 400 tons of CO‚ÇÇ per year. Reportedly, DB operates their fleet on pure battery running for between 50 and 75 percent of their overall operating time. Since November 2016, a small fleet of five Alstom H3 hybrid locomotives have been deployed at railway stations of Nuremberg Central Station and W√ºrzburg Hauptbahnhof. These locomotives are being used by Deutsche Bahn as part of an eight-year evaluation of the suitability of hybrids.Sadley, Katie. \\"Deutsche Bahn takes delivery of five Prima H3 hybrid locomotives.\\" globalrailwayreview.com, 18 October 2016. In addition to Deutsche Bahn, several industrial users have also adopted the H3 in small numbers.

The only promontory fort on Skye is located at Ullinish. It is situated to the west of Struan and just south of the hamlet of Ebost. Historically, Ullinish is associated with the MacLeod family. Of literary note, Samuel Johnson's views and denunciation of James Macpherson's Ossian were confirmed while Johnson was in Ullinish. Etymology The name Ullinish is from Old Norse √∫lfa-nes, meaning \\"promontory of the wolves\\". In Gaelic, it is sometimes spelt as Uilinis or Uilbhinis. Geography Entering Ullinish Located on the Inner Hebrides, Ullinish lies on a small peninsula, with a boggy moorland ending at Ullinish Point. Loch Caroy is situated between Ullinish Point and Harlosh Island. The small tidal island of Oronsay is joined to Ullinish Point at low tide, and separated by a breakwater. The town is overlooked by the low, basalt cliffs of the Cuillin Hills, and MacLeod's Table. Knock Ullinish is a small hill east of Ullinish. Fauna and flora The common teal nests in Ullinish. Other avifauna include the common raven, long-eared owl, hen harrier, merlin, osprey, black grouse, and bar-tailed godwit. Landmarks View towards the Lodge The largest building in the area is the Ullinish Country Lodge, a historic hotel which contains six rooms. Originally a farmhouse, it was built in 1757. The building is sheltered by a small brae and surrounded on three sides by lochs. James Boswell and Doctor Johnson stayed in the farmhouse between September 21‚Äì23, 1773 during their famous literary tour of the Hebrides, documented in The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides that was published in 1775. While in Ullinish, Johnson's views and denunciation of Macpherson's Ossian were confirmed. Here, too, Boswell remarked that the mountain view reminded him of those seen in Corsica. After two nights in Ullinish, they departed by boat for Talisker. Remains of a chambered cairn consisting of a denuded circle of boulders are found just north of the lodge. Also of archaeological interest is a partly destroyed Earth house on the east side of the northern extremity of Knock Ullinish.

People in Canill√° speak Spanish, K'iche' (a Mayan language), or both. Primary religions are Catholic and Evangelical.  History  =Pre Hispanic era = Worried about the defection of the aj K‚Äôub‚Äôul family chief -who had taken his family away in order to look for fertile and, above all, pacific land-, the K‚Äôiche‚Äô king sent a group of soldiers to control every single movement of them. He was afraid that the aj K'ub'ul would look for reinforcements from other ethnic group in the area to form a strong army and then attack the k'iche's. The warriors settled to the east of the aj K‚Äôub‚Äôul and since the latter had moved away to look for peace and tranquility, they were a very peaceful community. And that is exactly what the warriors inform the K‚Äôiche‚Äô king, reassuring him by telling that he should not worry about the exiled group, as they were really peaceful. As time went by, the k'iche' warriors realized that the aj K'ub'ul life was very different from the one they were used to have under the ruling of their king, as they simple worked on their land and crops and then enjoyed their families without having to worry about being invaded or called to fight in a war. Therefore, they went back to their place of origin, Tujalj (Sacapulas and Canill√°), but only to pick up their families and went on to settle a new community where they were once stationed to keep an eye on the aj K'ub'ul. = After the Spanish conquest of Guatemala= In the 16th and 17th centuries there were hardly any mention to Canill√°. In the 18th century, however, then archbishop of Guatemala, doctor Pedro Cort√©s y Larraz, made some notes on the place while he was traveling his parish between 1768 and made a stop at San Andr√©s Sahcabah√° (San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√°): \\"There is a ranch called Canili√° and even though there is a valley of about half hour, but the land is too dry and there is a maize of very deep ravines on both sides of the path; afterwards one crosses the Cacux river, who has a strong current from South to North\\". The \\"ranch\\" indication means that in those days there was still not a definitive human settlement, while the deep ravines come from the fact that Canill√° is located in the Sierra de Chuac√∫s mountains. = After the Independence of Central America = El Quich√© Department was established by executive action of 12 February 1872, which formed it from land coming from Solol√° and Totonicap√°n; in that executive action, a town called Caniy√° is mentioned. In 1880, in the Population Census of that year, Canill√° is listed as a settlement belonging to San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√°. In the census, Canill√° is a \\"settlement of the El Quich√© Department, distant 51 km from Santa Cruz del Quich√©, the department capital; and 607 inhabitants, who work in agriculture for the most part; there are not real industries in the area.\\" Canill√° was elevated to municipality by an executive action of president Jos√© Mar√≠a Reina Barrios on 21 March 1893. The municipality was suppressed, however, by an executive action of president Jorge Ubico on 26 August 1936 and went back to San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√° as a human settlement. Years later, yet another executive action, this time of president Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n, on 13 November 1951, reestablished the municipality under the same circumstances it was on 26 August 1936, when it was merged into San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√°. On May 1970 a school was built; the new structure had six classrooms, lunch room, warehouse, guardian room and the basic utilities. In the municipality there is a health center from the Secretariat of Public Health, which also started selling medications in early 1973. And as of 5 July 1973, the municipality had the authority to lease those municipal lots within its jurisdiction.  Economy  Canill√° is an isolated city dependent on subsistence farming. Crops include corn, platanos, and other tropical fruits and vegetables. The small central city has the Municipal offices, a library, post office, and stores, including telephone services. Manufacturing includes brick making. The main roads connecting Canill√° to San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√° and Santa Cruz del Quich√©, or Zacualpa and Joyabaj are unpaved and can be precarious in the rainy season; they suffer from erosion, potholes and landslides. The poor state of the roads seriously limits Canill√°'s access to regional markets. Employment opportunities in Canill√° are few. Many people from Canill√° travel for work, either to other areas of Guatemala, or to Mexico or the United States. One group from Canill√° works in Tuscarawas County, Ohio.  Mayan Ruins at Chijoj, called \\"Los Cerritos\\"  The Mayan ruins at Chijoj Outside Canill√° past the Aldea (village) Chijoj are the Mayan ruins, called \\"Los Cerritos\\" (Spanish: \\"Little Hills\\").

The Ixil region is isolated by beautiful mountains and has maintained its rich Ixil Maya traditions and language. Chajul, Nebaj, and Cotzal make up the Ixil Region in the Department of Quich√© in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. Having been at the heart of the 36-year civil war, Chajul experiences post-war challenges such as emotional trauma, land displacement, and fragmented families. Additionally, unemployment is high, large families live in one-room adobe houses with open cooking fires, opportunities for women are scarce, and family- and gender- based violence are common. The community has a corn-based agricultural economy in which adults struggle daily to feed their families and the average income is $1‚Äì3 per day. A 2002 study revealed that less than 1% of children graduate from high school (5% from middle school) as they are forced to leave school at a young age to help support the family household, leaving 75% of the adult population illiterate.

The decree literally said: \\"It is of public interest and national emergency, the establishment of Agrarian Development Zones in the area included within the municipalities: San Ana Huista, San Antonio Huista, Nent√≥n, Jacaltenango, San Mateo Ixtat√°n, and Santa Cruz Barillas in Huehuetenango; Chajul and San Miguel Uspant√°n in Quich√©; Cob√°n, Chisec, San Pedro Carch√°, Lanqu√≠n, Senah√∫, Cahab√≥n and Chahal, in Alta Verapaz and the entire department of Izabal.\\" = Guerrilla Army of the Poor = On January 19, 1972 members of a new Guatemalan guerrilla movement entered Ixc√°n, from Mexico, and were accepted by many farmers; in 1973, after an exploratory foray into the municipal seat of Cotzal, the insurgent group decided to set up camp underground in the mountains of Xolchich√©, municipality of Chajul. In 1974 the insurgent guerrilla group held its first conference, where it defined its strategy of action for the coming months and called itself Guerrilla Army of the Poor (-Ej√©rcito Guerrillero de los Pobres -EGP-). In 1975 the organization had spread around the area of the mountains of northern municipalities of Nebaj and Chajul. As part of its strategy EGP decided to perpetrate notorious acts which also symbolized the establishment of a \\"social justice\\" against the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the judicial and administrative State institutions. They also wanted that with these actions the indigenous rural population of the region identified with the insurgency, thus motivating them to join their ranks. As part of this plan it was agreed to do the so-called \\"executions\\"; in order to determine who would be subject to \\"execution\\", the EGP gathered complaints received from local communities. For example, they selected two victims: Guillermo Monz√≥n, who was a military Commissioner in Ixc√°n and Jos√© Luis Arenas, the largest landowner in the area, and who had been reported to the EGP for allegedly having land conflicts with neighboring settlements and abusing their workers. Arenas, who at that time a journalist had nicknamed as the \\"Ixc√°n Tiger\\" had been active in Guatemalan politics and during Carlos Arana Osorio presidency (1970-1974) was in charge of the Promotion and Development of Pet√©n agency (FYDEP); later, he left politics for agriculture in his coffee and cardamom plantations in the Ixc√°n and the Ixil area, in Quich√©. On Saturday, 7 June 1975, Jos√© Luis Arenas was murdered when he was in the premises of his farm \\"La Perla\\" to pay his workers. In front of his office there were approximately two to three hundred people to receive their payment and four EGP members hidden among the farmers. After the business at hand was over, guerrilla members destroyed the communication radio of the farm and executed Arenas. Following Arenas murder, the guerrilla members spoke in Ixil language to the farmers, informing them that they were members of the Guerrilla Army of the Poor and had killed the \\"Ixc√°n Tiger\\" due to his alleged multiple crimes against community members. Then the attackers fled towards Chajul. Jos√© Luis Arenas' son, who was in San Luis Ixc√°n at the time, took refuge in a nearby mountain, waiting for a plane to arrive to take him to Guatemala City, in order to immediately report the matter to Minister of Defense, general Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia (who later was president from 1978 to 1982). General Romeo Lucas replied, \\"You are mistaken, there are no guerrillas in the area\\". Climate Chajul has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb).

History = Monastery and doctrine of Order of Preachers = Order of Preachers coat of arms. After the conquest, the Spanish crown focused on the Catholic indoctrination of the natives. Human settlements founded by royal missionaries in the New World were called \\"Indian doctrines\\" or simply \\"doctrines\\". Originally, friars had only temporary missions: teach the Catholic faith to the natives, and then transfer the settlements to secular parishes, just like the ones that existed in Spain at the time; the friars were supposed to teach Spanish and Catholicism to the natives. And when the natives were ready, they could start living in parishes and contribute with mandatory tithing, just like the people in Spain. But this plan never materialized, mainly because the Spanish crown lost control of the regular orders as soon as their friars set course to America. Shielded by their apostolic privileges granted to convert natives into Catholicism, the missionaries only responded to their order local authorities, and never to that of the Spanish government or the secular bishops. The orders local authorities, in turn, only dealt with their own order and not with the Spanish crown. Once a doctrine had been established, the protected their own economic interests, even against those of the King and thus, the doctrines became Indian towns that remains unaltered for the rest of the Spanish colony. The doctrines were founded at the friars discretion, given that they were completely at liberty to settle communities provided the main purpose was to eventually transfer it as a secular parish which would be tithing of the bishop. In reality, what happened was that the doctrines grew uncontrollably and were never transferred to any secular parish; they formed around the place where the friars had their monastery and from there, they would go out to preach to settlements that belong to the doctrine and were called \\"annexes\\", \\"visits\\" or \\"visit towns\\". Therefore, the doctrines had three main characteristics: # they were independent from external controls (both ecclesiastical and civilian ) # were run by a group of friars # had a relatively larger number of annexes. The main characteristic of the doctrines was that they were run by a group of friars, because it made sure that the community system would continue without any issue when one of the members died. In 1638, the Order of Preachers split their large doctrines ‚Äîwhich meant large economic benefits for them‚Äî in groups centered around each one of their six monasteries, including the Sacapulas monastery, under whose jurisdiction was the Cun√©n doctrine: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" width=28% - style=\\"color:white;\\" !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" align=centerMonastery !style=\\"background:#659ec7;\\" align=centerDoctrines - !style=\\"background:lemonchiffon;\\"Sacapulas  * Sacapulas * Cun√©n * Nebaj * Santa Cruz * San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√° * Zacualpa * Chichicastenango } = After the independence of Central America = After the independence of Central America in 1821 began the Central American Civil War between the conservatives that wanted to keep the regular orders and aristocrats in control, and the liberals who wanted to expel them. In 1829, after general Francisco Moraz√°n's victory, the conservative regime of Mariano de Aycinena y Pi√±ol was taken down and both his family and associated and the regular clergy were expelled from Central America, leaving behind only secular clergy priests, although heavily weakened, given that mandatory tithing was abolished. This heavily impacted Cun√©n, as the Order of Preachers was forced to leave the country leaving their doctrine behind; in 1836, liberal government of Mariano G√°lvez incorporated Cun√©n to Solol√°'s district. After the conservatives regained power in 1840, the regular clergy returned to Guatemala, but they were not able to recover their old properties. But they were expelled once again after the Liberal Revolution of 1871 and with the creation of Quich√© Department in 1872, Cun√©n was raised to municipality category by executive order #72 of 12 August 1872. Years later, general Jorge Ubico declared Cun√©n as a pre Columbine National Monument on 24 April 1931. = Guatemalan Civil War = During the Guatemalan Civil War Cun√©n found itself in the area where the Ej√©rcito Guerrillero de los Pobres -one of the guerrilla organizations that operated in Guatemala- was active. This organization justified its terrorist attacks against private and public infrastructure by saying that they only impacted the economic interests of both State and the country's productive sector and that it made the Guatemalan Army more vulnerable. In the Comisi√≥n para el Esclarecimiento Hist√≥rico final report, former EGP members said that \\"destroying infrastructure just under the concept of destroying the country's infrasestroture, to damage the country, that did not happened. There was always an explanation... in context with the war that we were sustaining at the time and in context within the tactic moment when we were going to blow up a bridge, yes, we were going to blow it up so that the Army could not go through and to stop it from its barbarism... to cut its advances and withdraws- But from Nent√≥n to the North, the highway was closed [end of 1981 to beginning of 1982], the Army did not get in, not a single authority would come in, and the telegraph posts -which where the other communication device that existed- were taken down\\". \\"When we cut power to some (Army) barracks the power to the closest towns and village was cut as well, creating resentment in the population.

In several cases, massacres occurred either at a special day for a community or during large scale operatives with large military force displays and aviation backup. The airplanes bombed certain zones; at least one of each nine communities suffered a bombing associated to a massacre, either in the previous or following days. The areas more heavily bombed were the Ixil triangle and Sacapulas, some parts of Baja Verapaz Department and also from Huehuetenango Department. After an attack of this kind it was common that up to 40 % of the surviving population left town to survive, going into the mountains, into exile in Mexico or to another community. The maya k'iche' population that looked for refuge in the mountains was labeled as \\"guerrilla\\" by the Army, which tighten military controls around them and continuous attacks that made extremely had to get food or medical attention. These people remained in the mountains for almost two years until they finally moved to Las Guacamayas, where they became isolated due to the military pressure. A lot of people died of starvation. Specifically in Cun√©n, State Armed Forces would have perpetrated massacres in the Cun√©n Villa on January 1981, and in the Chutuj settlement Chimanzana village on January 1982.

Santa Maria Nebaj is part of the Ixil Community, along with San Juan Cotzal and San Gaspar Chajul. Native residents speak the Mayan Ixil language. The community is named in part for Nebaj, a pre-Columbian archaeological site of the Maya civilization. History =Spanish conquest= The difficult terrain and remoteness of the Cuchumatanes made their conquest difficult. In the ten years after the fall of Zaculeu, various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al peoples. The Spanish hoped to extract gold, silver and other riches from the mountains, but their remoteness, the difficult terrain, and relatively low population made the conquest and exploitation of this aea extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish arrived in the region, the Mayans had already suffered high mortality from the Old World infectious diseases brought by colonists and spread by traders. Their population had declined to 150,000, with accompanying social disruption to many communities from the epidemics of disease. After the western portion of the Cuchumatanes fell to the Spanish, the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were sufficiently isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies. In 1529, four years after the Spanish conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces, and Uspant√°n was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that the Spanish decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj. As the Spanish army marched east toward Uspant√°n; Arias received notice that the acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Ordu√±a, had deposed him as magistrate. Arias handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to confront de Ordu√±a. Although his officers advised against it, Olmos launched a full-scale frontal assault on Uspant√°n. As soon as the Spanish began their assault, they were attacked from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors. They sacrificed the enemies on the altar of their deity Exbalamquen. The survivors fought their way back to the Spanish garrison at Q'umarkaj. A year later Francisco de Castellanos set out from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now relocated to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition against the Ixil and Uspantek. He led eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry, and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition rested at Chichicastenango and recruited further forces before marching seven leagues northward to Sacapulas and climbing the steep southern slopes of the Cuchumatanes. On the upper slopes, these forces clashed with a force of between four and five thousand Ixil warriors from Nebaj and nearby settlements. A lengthy battle followed, during which the Spanish cavalry outflanked the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish force besieged the city, and their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold and set it on fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the Spanish to storm the entrance and break the defences. The victorious Spanish rounded up the surviving defenders, and the next day Castellanos ordered them to be branded as slaves as punishment for their resistance. After learning of this battle, the inhabitants of Chajul capitulated to the Spanish. The Spanish continued east towards Uspant√°n, where they found it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cun√©n, Sacapulas and Verapaz. Although much outnumbered, the advantages of the Spanish cavalry and the firearms of the infantry enabled them to defeat the Mayans. The Spanish overran Uspant√°n and branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes. The Spanish divided the Ixil people among four towns: Nebaj, Cotzal, Chajul and Ilom. =20th century: Guatemala Civil War= In 1982, in the remote Guatemalan highlands, where the military classified those most isolated as being more accessible to the guerrillas, it identified many villages and communities as \\"red\\" and targeted them for annihilation. This was especially true in Quiche Department, where the army had a well-documented belief from the Benedicto Lucas period that the entire indigenous population of the Ixil area was pro-EGP. A major part of Rios Montt's pacification strategy in El Quiche was \\"Operation Sofia,\\" which began on July 8, 1982 on orders from Army Chief of Staff H√©ctor Mario L√≥pez Fuentes. \\"Operation Sofia\\" was planned and executed by the 1st Battalion of the Guatemalan Airborne Troops with the mission to \\"exterminate the subversive elements in the area - Quich√©.\\" The CIIDH database documented 18,000 killings by government forces in the year 1982. In April 1982 alone (General Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt's first full month in office), the military committed 3,330 documented killings, a rate of approximately 111 per day. Historians and analysts estimate the total death toll could exceed this number by the tens of thousands. Some sources estimate a death toll of up to 75,000 during the Rios Montt period, mostly within the first eight months between April and November 1982.

History  =Pre Hispanic era = Worried about the defection of the aj K‚Äôub‚Äôul family chief -who had taken his family away in order to look for fertile and, above all, pacific land-, the K‚Äôiche‚Äô king sent a group of soldiers to control every single movement of them. He was afraid that the aj K'ub'ul would look for reinforcements from other ethnic group in the area to form a strong army and then attack the k'iche's. The warriors settled to the east of the aj K‚Äôub‚Äôul and since the latter had moved away to look for peace and tranquility, they were a very peaceful community. And that is exactly what the warriors inform the K‚Äôiche‚Äô king, reassuring him by telling that he should not worry about the exiled group, as they were really peaceful. As time went by, the k'iche' warriors realized that the aj K'ub'ul life was very different from the one they were used to have under the ruling of their king, as they simple worked on their land and crops and then enjoyed their families without having to worry about being invaded or called to fight in a war. Therefore, they went back to their place of origin, Tujalj (Sacapulas and Canill√°)), but only to pick up their families and went on to settle a new community where they were once stationed to keep an eye on the aj K'ub'ul. =Campaigns in the Cuchumatanes= The difficult terrain and remoteness of the Cuchumatanes made their conquest difficult.

The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because of the effects of the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.

The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, four years after the conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and Uspant√°n was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'.

The Spaniards were barely able to organise a defence before the defending army attacked. Although heavily outnumbered, the deployment of Spanish cavalry and the firearms of the Spanish infantry eventually decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspant√°n and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes. = Pacific conquest by the Dominican friars= On his second visit to Guatemala, in 1537, friar Bartolome de las Casas, O.P. wanted to employ his new method of conversion based on two principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on knowledge and understanding of the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like. Because of the fact that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising that if the venture was successful he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area. Las Casas's group of friars established a Dominican presence in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cob√°n, reaching as far as Chahal. Through the efforts of Las Casas' missionaries the so-called \\"Land of War\\" came to be called \\"Verapaz\\", \\"True Peace\\". Las Casas's strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native chiefs, among them those of Atitl√°n and Chichicastenango, and in building several churches in the territory named Alta Verapaz. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Francisco Marroquin who wanted him to go to Mexico and then on to Spain in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission. = Monastery and doctrine of Order of Preachers = Order of Preachers coat of arms.

In 1829, after general Francisco Moraz√°n's victory, the conservative regime of Mariano de Aycinena y Pi√±ol was taken down and both his family and associated and the regular clergy were expelled from Central America, leaving behind only secular clergy priests, although heavily weakened, given that mandatory tithing was abolished. This heavily impacted Sacapulas, as the Order of Preachers was forced to leave the country leaving their doctrines and monastery behind. After the conservatives regained power in 1840, the regular clergy returned to Guatemala, but they were not able to recover their old properties. But they were expelled once again after the Liberal Revolution of 1871 and with the creation of Quich√© Department in 1872, Sacapulas was raised to municipality category. = Guatemalan Civil War = During the Guatemalan Civil War Sacapulas found itself in the area where the Ej√©rcito Guerrillero de los Pobres -one of the guerrilla organizations that operated in Guatemala- was active. This organization justified its terrorist attacks against private and public infrastructure by saying that they only impacted the economic interests of both State and the country's productive sector and that it made the Guatemalan Army more vulnerable. In the Comisi√≥n para el Esclarecimiento Hist√≥rico final report, former EGP members said that \\"destroying infrastructure just under the concept of destroying the country's infrasestroture, to damage the country, that did not happened. There was always an explanation... in context with the war that we were sustaining at the time and in context within the tactic moment when we were going to blow up a bridge, yes, we were going to blow it up so that the Army could not go through and to stop it from its barbarism... to cut its advances and withdraws- But from Nent√≥n to the North, the highway was closed [end of 1981 to beginning of 1982], the Army did not get in, not a single authority would come in, and the telegraph posts -which where the other communication device that existed- were taken down\\". \\"When we cut power to some (Army) barracks the power to the closest towns and village was cut as well, creating resentment in the population. Afterwards, the sabotages were commonplace in order to create chaos along the country and preparing the conditions of a pre insurrection state\\".

In several cases, massacres occurred either at a special day for a community or during large scale operatives with large military force displays and aviation backup. The airplanes bombed certain zones; at least one of each nine communities suffered a bombing associated to a massacre, either in the previous or following days. The areas more heavily bombed were the Ixil triangle and Sacapulas, some parts of Baja Verapaz Department and also from Huehuetenango Department. After an attack of this kind it was common that up to 40% of the surviving population left town to survive, going into the mountains, into exile in Mexico or to another community. The maya k'iche' population that looked for refuge in the mountains was labeled as \\"guerrilla\\" by the Army, which tighten military controls around them and continuous attacks that made extremely had to get food or medical attention. These people remained in the mountains for almost two years until they finally moved to Las Guacamayas, where they became isolated due to the military pressure. A lot of people died of starvation.

The municipality is formed by the town San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√°, and 62 rural communities. The majority (89%) of its population is ethnic K'iche'. History In pre-colonial times, the area was known as Sajcabaj√° and was populated by one of the lineages of the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj. After the defeat of the K'iche', the Spanish colonial presence in Sajcabaj√° began between 1552 and 1580, when the Dominican convent in Sacapulas was put in charge of the conversi√≥n of its population, through the colonial reducciones system.Jean PIEL. Sajcabaja: Muerte y resurreccion de un pueblo de Guatemala, 1500-1970. Mexico/Guatemala, CEMCA/SISG, 1989. During the colonial era, San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√° functioned as a staging place, between Joyabaj and Sacapulas, on the road (camino real) connecting the Guatemalan capital (then located in Tecp√°n) to Chiapas. San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√° was established as a municipality in 1892. This mural is in the parish hall of the Catholic Church in San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√°. In recent history, San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√° suffered the consequences of the 36 year Guatemalan civil war (1960-1996). These consequences were especially hard felt in the years 1981-1984, when the Guatemalan army established a military garrison in the town's Catholic convent, and began a campaign of unprecedented repression against the population. Geography The municipality of San Andr√©s Sajcabaj√° is situated in the Sierra de Chuac√∫s mountain range. The town and its rural communities are located at an altitude between 1,000 and 2,000 m. Its climate is temperate, with mean temperatures oscillating between 12¬∞C and 24¬∞C, and an annual precipitation between 1,000 - 2,000 mm. As a result of its mountainous character, over 77% of the municipality's territory is too steep to be of any other agricultural use than forestry. The principal agricultural products are maize and beans, which are cultivated for local consumption. Horticulture is only practised in a small number of communities with access to irrigation. Horticultural products, like tomatoes, onions, cabbage, squash and g√ºisquil, are sold on the local market. Notes References : : External links *Municipal Map Maya, found in San Andr√©s.

The family of Nobel Peace Prize winner is originally from this municipality. History = Monastery and doctrine of the Dominican Order = Dominican Order coat of arms. After the conquest, the Spanish crown focused on the Catholic indoctrination of the natives. Human settlements founded by royal missionaries in the New World were called \\"Indian doctrines\\" or simply \\"doctrines\\". Originally, friars had only temporary missions: teach the Catholic faith to the natives, and then transfer the settlements to secular parishes, just like the ones that existed in Spain at the time; the friars were supposed to teach Spanish and Catholicism to the natives. And when the natives were ready, they could start living in parishes and contribute with mandatory tithing, just like the people in Spain. But this plan never materialized, mainly because the Spanish crown lost control of the regular orders as soon as their friars set course to America. Shielded by their apostolic privileges granted to convert natives into Catholicism, the missionaries only responded to their order local authorities, and never to that of the Spanish government or the secular bishops. The orders local authorities, in turn, only dealt with their own order and not with the Spanish crown. Once a doctrine had been established, the protected their own economic interests, even against those of the King and thus, the doctrines became Indian towns that remains unaltered for the rest of the Spanish colony. The doctrines were founded at the friars discretion, given that they were completely at liberty to settle communities provided the main purpose was to eventually transfer it as a secular parish which would be tithing of the bishop. In reality, what happened was that the doctrines grew uncontrollably and were never transferred to any secular parish; they formed around the place where the friars had their monastery and from there, they would go out to preach to settlements that belong to the doctrine and were called \\"annexes\\", \\"visits\\" or \\"visit towns\\". Therefore, the doctrines had three main characteristics: # they were independent from external controls (both ecclesiastical and secular) # were run by a group of friars # had a relatively larger number of annexes. The main characteristic of the doctrines was that they were run by a group of friars, because it made sure that the community system would continue without any issue when one of the members died. In 1638, the Dominican Order split their large doctrines ‚Äîwhich meant large economic benefits for them‚Äî in groups centered around each one of their six monasteries; Zacualpa's doctrine was assigned to the Sacapulas Convent. In 1754, the Dominican Order had to transfer all of their doctrines and convents to the secular clergy, as part of the Bourbon reforms. =21st century= On 8 October 2015, the elected mayor from LIDER, Sabino Ervin Calachij Guti√©rrez, and his father, former mayor Ernesto Calachij Riz, were sent to prison along three other suspects accused of tentative first degree murder. Etymology Many place names in Guatemala, including the name of the country, are Nahuatl names imposed by the conquering Spaniards, using words given to them by their Mexican allies. Sac in Maya means white, however, and the legend is that the white sediments in the banks and hills above the Polochic River are the origin of Sac Wal B'a. As of 1850, the British were calling Zacualpa, Sacualpa. Both spellings are still found informally.

Ringo Lam was the original director, but he left the project after a few weeks of filming in Canada. After that, Lam was replaced by Cess Silvera who was fired after two weeks of filming in Cape Town, South Africa. The film was released to some countries' cinemas but direct to DVD in most places.  Plot  After years as a mob enforcer, Ben Archer (Jean-Claude van Damme) moves from Marseille to Los Angeles and decides to become legitimate so he can spend more time with his wife Cynthia (Lisa King) and son Nicholas (Pierre Marais). Cynthia is a social worker with the INS, helping to process illegal Chinese immigrants. When a ship full of immigrants from Hong Kong is intercepted, she discovers a young girl named Kim (Valerie Tian) among them and decides, against regulations, to bring her home. She convinces a judge and INS agent Mac Hoggins (Danny Keogh) that the girl will be in grave danger if deported and asks for a week to make her case for asylum. Kim's father, Sun Quan (Simon Yam), is a Chinese Triad boss who Kim saw murder her mother when she tried to leave him. Having learned from Hoggins, who is corrupt, where Kim is, Sun Quan comes to Los Angeles and kills Cynthia, her parents and many of the workers at the restaurant where they are dining. Nicholas and Kim flee amid the chaos. Ben, arriving late, engages in a shootout with the fleeing Triad members but is unable to stop them escaping before finding his wife's body. After a period of intense grief, he resolves to rescue the children and avenge Cynthia's death. Ben enlists the help of Cynthia's uncle, Max (Anthony Fridjohn), a wheelchair-bound French mobster, along with Max's bodyguard Raymond (Claude Hern√°ndez) and friend Tony (Tony Schiena). Nicholas and Kim are found and kept hidden at Max's house. Ben decides to target Andy Wang (Tom Wu), one of the Triad members he saw fleeing the restaurant, having learned his name from police mugshots. Tony knows that Wang likes to frequent a brothel; Ben and Tony storm the brothel and kill Wang, along with several other Triad members. Da Costa (Warrick Grier), the homicide detective assigned to both Cynthia and Wang's murders, is surprised to see Hoggins at the second crime scene for no apparent reason. During an informal visit to Max's house the next morning, he makes a point of mentioning this. Ben and Tony kidnap Hoggins - not realizing the Triads are watching - and take him to Max's house, where they brutally torture him for answers. Ben gets a call from Da Costa, who is at the morgue with some of the immigrants who died on the ship; an autopsy has revealed they were being used as drug mules. After Ben leaves, Max and Raymond force Hoggins to confess to his involvement with Sun Quan's heroin smuggling operation, as well as the boat he'll be on that night. Out of vengeance for Cynthia, they torture him to death. Ben arrives at the morgue to discover that Da Costa and the attendants have been killed, and the heroin stolen, by two Triad members on motorbikes. He chases them down and kills them. Returning to Max's house, he and Tony see Triad vehicles speeding away, with Kim and Nicholas inside. Tony rushes into the house while Ben gives chase. Ben is able to rescue Kim, but the Triads escape with Nicholas. They return to the house, where Tony tells Ben that Max and Raymond have been killed. Knowing Sun Quan will be at the docks that night, Ben and Tony storm his ship and kill all the Triad members on board. Sun Quan appears with Nicholas as a hostage; after a standoff, he and Ben shoot each other. Ben is severely wounded, while Sun Quan dies. Ben embraces Nicholas as the police arrive.

The original edition was published in 1973; revised and expanded editions were issued in 1975, 1995, 2004, and 2011. The newest edition of the book covers a broad history of the company and specific sections for movies, Pixar, live action and the Theme parks. The latest edition also includes a foreword by John Lasseter.  Author Information  Christopher Finch was born in Guernsey, England in 1939. Beginning his painting career in Paris and in London at the Chelsea Art School, he transitioned into the field of writing about art for magazines. He went on to write about many famous artists and pop artists including Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Jim Dine, David Hockney, Ed Ruscha, and more. The first books he published were a collection of essays based on his work with artists and pop artists: Pop Art: Object & Image, Image as Language: Aspects of British Art, and a monograph about the work of Patrick Caulfield. Later, he became an associate curator at the Walker Art Center before going to New York to continue writing. This is where he began the work The Art of Walt Disney and many other distinguished titles. After a long break from making art himself, in 1984 he returned to making graphics, photography, and paintings, some of which were featured in multiple galleries around the United States. History After Walt Disney became famous for his achievements, Christopher Finch decided to make a book called \\"Art of Walt Disney\\". Originally published in 1973, the book by Christopher Finch, Art of Walt Disney, is about the innovations of Walt Disney and it has been revised and expanded many different times and with in these many times, his definition of ‚ÄúArt‚Äù is always changing. This expansive revision of the 1973 edition contains seven additional chapters, with color illustrations, on Disney films such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Background of Disney and His Art Walter Elias Disney was born on December 5th, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois. He moved to Marceline, Missouri with his family as a young child. He had four siblings who later aided in his successful company. Not long after, Walt began drawing and painting, even going so far as to paint farm animals on the side of his family‚Äôs home. Four years later, his father fell sick and the family moved again to Kansas City. Walt had to help, at age nine, deliver newspapers with his father in the hours before school, however he still continued his passion for art. As he got older, he continued with his drawing and started selling his pictures to neighbors and friends. In high school, His family then moved back to Chicago where Walt was an active member of his school‚Äôs newspaper, whom he drew cartoons for, while also dividing much of his time to photography. In 1917, he joined efforts in Europe during World War I then returned ultimately to Kansas City to graduate high school and start his first animation series. After meeting his life long friend Ub Iwerks, Walt Disney drawing GoofyAs a young adult, Walt not only continued his drawing and painting, but also starting working with animation and made short animated videos for the company he worked for at the time, Pesman-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. Walt eventually left that company due to layoffs, and instead decided with his friend, Ub Iwerks, to start their own company called Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. Unfortunately, Walt and Ub‚Äôs company did not last very long, and they soon found new jobs at a new company, the Kansas City Film Ad Company, formally known as the Kansas City Slide Company. Here, Walt learned even more about the art of animation, and contributed to creating commercials that played before movies. It was not long after when Walt decided to leave the Kansas City Film Ad Company to start another one of his own, called Laugh- O-Gram Films, where he created his first popular cartoon called Alice‚Äôs Wonderland, which turned into a series called Alice Comedies. Unfortunately for Walt, not enough money was coming in, which lead to many of his employees quitting his company, and forcing him to declare bankruptcy. He moved to Hollywood and started the Disney Brothers Studio. In 1927, Walt created a new character called Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, which also became popular. However, the distributor he was working with at the time, Charles Mintz, hired all of Walt‚Äôs animation employees and told him that he had no rights to Oswald, because the cartoon was not copyrighted under Walt‚Äôs name. After, Walt, his brother Roy O. Disney, and Ub Iwerks, came together to create all new characters, all of which Walt was going to make sure he owned. Mickey Mouse was soon developed, a character Walt had been inspired to create just from a simple pet mouse he once had in his office back in Missouri. He had to go through many hurdles with Charles Mintz, Walt's distributor, before winning the rights to his character. The name of his company was changed to The Walt Disney Studio the same year he married Lillian Bounds with whom he had two daughters, Sharon and Diane. During World War II he produced fan favorites such as Fantasia, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi. He continued to have monumental success into he 1950's and 60's. He holds the record for most Academy Awards won, the George Washington Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Lyndon B Johnson. He helped established the California Institute of the Arts in 1961. Five years later, in 1966, he passed away due to long cancer, but his work and legacy live on.

His ca. 1575 memoir, Memoria de las cosas y costa y indios de la Florida, is one of the most valuable contemporary accounts of American Indian life from that period. The manuscript can be found in the General Archive of the Indies.Worth: 339 In all, he produced five documents describing the peoples of native Florida.Worth: 339-340  Biography  Fontaneda was the second son of Garcia de Escalante and Ana de Aldana. His father was a Spanish official in South America. Fontaneda was born in either Peru or Colombia, around 1536. In 1549, when Fontaneda was thirteen, he and his brother were sailing to Spain, to study in Salamanca, when their ship wrecked on the coast of Florida. The surviving crew and passengers were captured by the Calusa, who enslaved them and eventually sacrificed most of them, including Fontaneda's brother.Ferdinando: 213‚Äì214 Fontaneda apparently escaped death by correctly interpreting their commands to sing and dance for them. He spent the next seventeen years living among the Calusa and other tribes, learning several languages and travelling extensively through Florida. Around 1566 Fontaneda was rescued from his captivity by Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, Florida's first Spanish governor and founder of St. Augustine, who bargained for Fontaneda's freedom from the chief of the Calusa, who was called King Carlos by the Spanish. He served as an interpreter and guide for Men√©ndez on a number of missions for the next several years, and returned to Spain in 1569 to reclaim his parents' property from the Crown. In 1575 he wrote his memoir, which proved valuable to historians of the day such as Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, and remains so today. Besides the memoir (memoria), which is eight folios long, a memorandum, a list of caciques, and two fragments of text attributed to Fontaneda, each of one folio, have been identified.Worth: 340-341 Fontaneda provides the city of Tampa's earliest written mention. He names 22 important villages of the Calusa, the first being \\"Tanpa\\". He gives no details concerning the exact location of Tanpa, but archaeologist Jerald Milanich places the Calusa village of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor, the original \\"Bay of Tanpa\\". A later Spanish expedition did not notice Charlotte Harbor while sailing north along the west coast of Florida and assumed that the current Tampa Bay was the bay they sought. The name was accidentally transferred north.Milanich, Jerald T. 1995. Florida Indians and the Invasion from Europe. University Press of Florida. p. 40. His \\"Memoir\\" also proved instrumental in the development of the Fountain of Youth legend as an early mention of Juan Ponce de Le√≥n looking for the healing waters in Florida, a detail almost inseparable from the myth today.

S. Forester wrote about fictional Royal Navy officer Horatio Hornblower. All the other novels in the series take place during the wars with revolutionary and Napoleonic France; this one, however, takes place when Britain is at peace, May 1821 ‚Äì October 1823. Hornblower has been promoted rear-admiral and has been named in command of the West Indies station (i.e., the Caribbean) with a squadron consisting of three frigates and fourteen brigs and schooners. It is the last Hornblower novel chronologically, although at least one short story (\\"The Last Encounter\\") is set after the events in this novel. Like some other Hornblower novels, Forester wrote it in the form of several novellas that can be read independently. Plot summary =St. Elizabeth of Hungary= Hornblower left New Orleans and rushed to the channel between Trinidad and Tobago in order to intercept Napoleon's Old Guard on their way from Galveston to free Napoleon from his imprisonment at St Helena. Hornblower raises his flag in the schooner HMS Crab and pays a courtesy call at New Orleans. There, he learns of a plot by Napoleon's most loyal followers to liberate him from his exile on the isolated island of St Helena. Hornblower intercepts their ship, the Daring, but is powerless to stop them by force; with no other choice, he is prepared to sacrifice his honour for the sake of peace in Europe. He lies to their leader, Count Cambronne, telling him that Napoleon has died. When he returns to port, he learns to his astonishment and relief that his lie was the truth, recalling Saint Elizabeth's miracle of the roses. =The Star of the South= While attempting to suppress the slave trade, HMS Clorinda, the vessel carrying Hornblower's flag, follows a faster slave ship, the Estrella del Sur, into a Puerto Rican port. Hornblower figures out a way to disable the slave ship, so that when it leaves port, the Clorinda will be able to catch it. Hornblower, characteristically, outsmarts his subordinate, the dim-witted, pompous Captain Fell of the Clorinda to the point he thinks the sabotage plan was his idea. =The Bewildered Pirates= Pirates kidnap Hornblower and his young secretary Spendlove and take them to their hideout near Montego Bay, in an attempt to extort a pardon for themselves. They send Hornblower with their demand, keeping Spendlove as hostage. Hornblower feels honour-bound to return to secure Spendlove's release, but finds the resourceful secretary has escaped. Free to act, Hornblower leads a sea-borne attack on the pirate's camp, using mortars to reduce their hideout. Forester takes artistic license with the geography of Jamaica. =The Guns of Carabobo= Hornblower is visited by a rich young wool merchant, named Ramsbottom, one of the first millionaires. The young man is on a tour of the Caribbean in his yacht, a converted ex-Royal Navy brig-sloop, the Bride of Abydos. Hornblower tours Ramsbottom's yacht during a dinner party on board. Ramsbottom explains his interest in Latin America by saying that he has a Venezuelan mother. He is cautioned to stay away from the South American coast, which is in a state of rebellion against Spain. It turns out, however, that Ramsbottom, far from being a tourist, is dedicated to helping Spain's South American colonies to achieve their independence. While Hornblower and his squadron are conveniently away on manoeuvres, Ramsbottom, by pretending that his yacht is the Desperate, a Royal Navy brig enforcing a (bogus) blockade, captures the Helmond, an unsuspecting Dutch transport, and secures the Spanish artillery train forming its cargo. Hornblower hears the news on his return from manoeuvres and goes to investigate. He finds Ramsbottom's ship, empty, accompanied by the Helmond, anchored off the coast of Venezuela. The captured cannons have been instrumental in the defeat of the Spanish forces. Hornblower secures Bride of Abydos just before the arrival of a Spanish and a Dutch frigate, from where Spanish and Dutch naval officers swiftly arrive to demand its surrender. Hornblower by verbal trickery manages to avoid both surrendering the Bride of Abydos and starting a war. =The Hurricane= Hornblower's wife Barbara comes out to Jamaica for Hornblower's final days as Commander in Chief, and to accompany him home. Hornblower is troubled by the case of a young marine bandsman, Hudnutt, a naturally gifted musician who refuses to play what he feels is a wrong note. Hornblower is sympathetic to the man's plight, and endeavours to help him, but is constrained by the demands of naval discipline. As the couple leave the island he hears Hudnutt has escaped; later he finds Barbara had arranged it. On the voyage back, they endure a hurricane; Hornblower needs to use his skill as a seaman to ensure their survival. In the middle of the hurricane, Barbara drops her final wall of reserve as she assures him she has never loved another man. Chapter order Chapter 4 of the novel, \\"The Guns of Carabobo,\\" belongs historically immediately after Chapter 1, \\"St. Elizabeth of Hungary\\" and, in the original serialisation in John Bull (magazine) from 1957, \\"Hornblower and the Guns of Carabobo\\" was the second episode published. (Napoleon died on 5 May 1821 and the Battle of Carabobo took place on 24 June 1821.) This is the only Hornblower novel where events are not presented in chronological order.  Inaccuracies  In the Royal Navy of the early nineteenth century, promotion from captain to admiral was based solely on seniority.

From the central market, a walk of six blocks will put you in farmland. Aguacat√°n was served primarily by dirt roads cutting through the mountains. The dirt road suffered from erosion, potholes and landslides. The paving of the roads to Huehuetenango and Sacapulas and Nebaj was completed in 2006. It now links Aguacat√°n to the Pan American Highway (near Huehuetenango), and to markets and opportunities for economic growth. The Nacimiento del Rio San Juan is a natural spring where water pours up out of a small pool. The pool is surrounded by pipes that tap into the water supply. Irrigation from the spring explains the prolific agriculture in the area. The Nacimiento has a park with benches and a two- story observation area. Demographics Aguacat√°n is the only municipality in the world in which Awakateko is the native language. In outlying areas, even just a walk uphill to Aldea San Miguel or up the mountain road to Chex, the native language is K'iche'. Awakateko is spoken in some other aldeas, including Llano Coyote, near Rio San Juan. Awakateko and K'ichee' are both Mayan languages. Other languages spoken in the municipality are Mam and Chalchitek. Spanish is also spoken by most residents. Principal religions are Roman Catholic and Evangelicalism. Economy A central market is open most days. Bus service connects Aguacat√°n to Huehuetenango and other cities. Internet and telephone services are available. Poor economic conditions have prompted some residents to travel for work to other parts of Guatemala, and also to Mexico and the United States. Some have settled in Tuscarawas County, Ohio. History Aguacat√°n suffered much violence during the Civil War, especially in the early 1980s. The aldea of Chex was attacked, and is now five sub-communities. In the elections of December 30, 2003, 11 candidates challenged the incumbent mayor. The election results were disputed, a rally of most residents called for a new election, and the mayor closed city offices and operations for months. Climate Aguacat√°n has a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen: Cwb).

After the Spanish conquest of Guatemala in the 1520s, the \\"Presentaci√≥n de Guatemala\\" Mercedarian province was formed in 1565; originally, the order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy had gotten from bishop Francisco Marroqu√≠n several doctrines in the Sacatep√©quez and Chimaltenango valleys, close to the capital Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, but they traded those with the Order of Preachers friars in exchange for the doctrines those had in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes area. During the first part of the 17th century they also had doctrine in four town close to the city of Santiago, which eventually became city neighborhoods: Esp√≠ritu Santo, Santiago, San Jer√≥nimo and San Anton ‚Äîwhich was the capital of the Mercedarians, where they had their convent and where their comendador lived. According to bishop Juan de las Cabezas memoir in 1613 and the bishop Pedro Cort√©s y Larraz parish visit minutes from 1770, the Mercedarians came to have nine doctrines, and numerous annexes, which were: Santa Ana de Malacat√°n, Concepci√≥n de Huehuetenango, San Pedro de Solom√°, Nuestra Se√±ora de la Purificaci√≥n de Jacaltenango, Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria de Chiantla, San Andr√©s de Cuilco, Santiago de Tejutla, San Pedro de Sacatep√©quez, and San Juan de Ostuncalco. However, in 1754, due to the borbon reforms implemented by the Spanish kings, the Mercedarins -and the rest of the regular clergy for that matter-, had to transfer their doctrines to the secular clergy, thus losing their Chiantla convent and annexed doctrines. Climate At an altitude of approximately 2000m, Chiantla has a climate similar to that of Antigua, though with the extra 600m above sea level it is often a little chillier in the night. The rainy season is from May to October, with mornings starting out warm and humid, followed by heavy rains - and even hail - in the afternoons, which usually dissipate by evening. Population The inhabitants of the city are mostly ladino, it is common to hear the languages of Popti, Canjobal, Chuj, and Mam being spoken by street venders, shoppers and residents. Economy =Mining= Lead production was noted in the area in 1850. Modern exploration of the Chiantla mining district by Firestone Ventures, a Canadian firm headquartered in Edmonton, has produced a promising prospect for a lead, zinc, silver open pit mine at its Torlon Hill Zinc-Lead-Silver Project west of Chiantla at the site of the Cinco Hermanos workings. *Photos of the Torlon HIll Zinc project Climate Chiantla has a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen: Cwb).

History =Colonial history= In 1529, four years after the Spanish conquest of Huehuetenango, San Mateo Ixtat√°n (then known by the name of Ystapalap√°n) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle, a companion of Pedro de Alvarado, together with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango.San Mateo Ixtat√°n at Inforpressca MINEDUC 2001, pp. 14‚Äì15. In 1549, the first reduction of San Mateo Ixtat√°n took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries. In the late 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso De Le√≥n reported that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtat√°n did not pay tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass.Lovell 2000, pp. 416‚Äì417. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of precolumbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray Alonso de Le√≥n informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray Alsonso De Le√≥n was chased out of San Mateo Ixtat√°n by the locals. In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enriquez de Guzm√°n, the then governor of Guatemala, decided upon the reduction of San Mateo Ixtat√°n and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. 149‚Äì150. On 29 January 1686, captain Melchor Rodr√≠guez Mazariegos, under orders of the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat√°n, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, with 61 from San Mateo itself.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. XXXIII,153‚Äì154. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtat√°n were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Pet√©n Basin.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. 154. In order to prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three community leaders of San Mateo, named as Crist√≥bal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. 154‚Äì155. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtat√°n on 3 February, where captain Melchor Rodr√≠guez Mazariegos was already awaiting him.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. 156. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village to use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray Diego de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepci√≥n also remained in the town. After this, governor Enrique Enriquez de Guzm√°n left San Mateo Ixtat√°n for Comit√°n in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. 156, 160. In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtat√°n, Cob√°n and Ocosingo.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp.XXXIII. Captain Melchor Rodriguez Mazariegos accompanied by Fray Diego de Rivas and 6 more missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat√°n, managing to recruit 200 indigenous Maya warriors on the way; from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solom√° and San Mateo itself.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. XXXIV. They followed the same route used in 1686.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. XXXIII. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle. The Dominican Order built the Catholic church in San Mateo, which fell within the parish of Soloma.MINEDUC 2001, p. 15. =Republican history= San Mateo Ixtat√°n was forced to give up some of their territory to create the municipality of Nent√≥n in 1876 and it struggled to keep its communal lands. At the beginning of the 1900s, a law was enacted throughout Guatemala that the mayor and councilmen should be ladinos. During the liberal government of Justo Rufino Barrios, extreme poverty and forced migrations to the southern coast created a lasting state of tension in the northern communities of Huehuetenango and specifically in San Mateo Ixtat√°n. The ladino coastal plantation owners sent contractors to San Mateo Ixtat√°n on market days. These contractors gave money to local people promising double or triple the amount if they came to work in their coffee and cotton plantations. The locals signed documents insuring their manual labor, but were essentially enslaved because the contracts were unjust and treatment inhumane.Workshop from the PROPAZ organization, Sept. 10, 2008 On July 17, 1898, a plantation contractor was killed. To cover up the crime, 30 more ladinos were killed. One survived and informed the army who responded by killing 310 Chuj people from San Mateo Ixtat√°n.la Comisi√≥n para el Esclarecimiento Hist√≥rico (CEH) = Franja Transversal del Norte = The Northern Transversal Strip was officially created during the government of General Carlos Arana Osorio in 1970, by Legislative Decree 60-70, for agricultural development. The decree literally said: \\"It is of public interest and national emergency, the establishment of Agrarian Development Zones in the area included within the municipalities: San Ana Huista, San Antonio Huista, Nent√≥n, Jacaltenango, San Mateo Ixtat√°n, and Santa Cruz Barillas in Huehuetenango; Chajul and San Miguel Uspant√°n in Quich√©; Cob√°n, Chisec, San Pedro Carch√°, Lanqu√≠n, Senah√∫, Cahab√≥n and Chahal, in Alta Verapaz and the entire department of Izabal.\\"  Salt  Highly saturated salt water comes from the ground in several sacred wells. Historically, it is said that many traveled through San Mateo Ixtat√°n seeking the salt produced there. Many gather to pray in front of the wells to the goddess of salt, Atz‚Äôam. Women haul the salt-water up the long mountainside in plastic jugs where they use it as is or boil it to make a tasty, white salt. The salt is most famous as K'ik' Atz'am, Sal Negra or black salt. This is made by a few women in the town by adding a secret ingredient to the salt water as it boils. The black salt is very tasty and highly prized. It is said to have curative powers for the treatment of stomach ailments and headache. The well is managed by the mayor‚Äôs office and is open from Monday through Saturday from 1 to 5 pm.  Archaeological sites  Unexcavated pre-Columbian ruins of Wajxaklajun on the outskirts of San Mateo Ixtat√°n. Within the town of San Mateo Ixtat√°n, there are protected, but not excavated archaeological sites. The largest one is known as Yol K'u meaning within the sun or Wajxaklajun meaning eighteen.MINEDUC 2001, p. 18. It is spectacularly situated on a promontory, surrounded by four large mounds.

It is made of two woven pieces of brown or black sheep's wool, sewn together on the sides leaving the sleeves open for the arms.Stzolalil Stz'ib'chaj Heb' Chuj, ALMG, 2007, p. 33 The women traditionally wear a corte or long, Mayan wrap-around skirt. It is generally a bright red base patterned with white, yellow and green stripes. Cotton scarves are tied in their hair. The woman's huipil or top is a brightly multi-colored, hand-woven cotton poncho with a lacy collar. It is said that a full-size huipil from San Mateo Ixtat√°n takes about 9 months to a year to make.

Canal Road East (), Canal Road West () and the Canal Road Flyover () are important roads in the Wan Chai District of Hong Kong Island, between the areas of Causeway Bay and Wan Chai. History Before urban development, the area was the estuary of the Wong Nai Chung river, which flowed through Happy Valley. The 4th Governor of Hong Kong, John Bowring, developed the estuary area and named it Bowrington (or Bowring City). Bowrington Canal was built during the mid to late 1850s, fed by Wong Nai Chung. Because the long and narrow canal resembled the neck of a goose it was known as Ngo Keng Kan (). It was used by small vessels that could pass under various bridges along the route. The landmark Bowrington Bridge across the canal, built in 1861, was known as Ngo Keng Kiu () and carried the Hong Kong Tramways line across the waterway. The surrounding area is also known as Ngo Keng. The original wooden bridge was replaced by an iron one that opened in March 1892.Public Works Report for 1892 During the reclamation from 1922 to 1929 that created modern Wan Chai (the Praya East Reclamation Scheme) a wider bridge (100 foot width) was built with a double line of tram tracks.Praya East Reclamation Scheme - Final Report The canal was finally covered and made subterranean in the 1970s when the Flyover was built. However, the name survives for the area. Canal Road Flyover Canal Road Flyover () was built in the 1970s for the Cross- Harbour Tunnel, between Canal Road East and Canal Road West. Many who do not know the history of Canal Road might associate the flyover with Ngo Keng Kiu. It initially connected only Canal Road West to the north of Gloucester Road when it opened on 29 March 1972. Four years later, the flyover was expanded and extended south to the Aberdeen Tunnel entrance in Happy Valley (the extension is separately named Wong Nai Chung Gap Flyover). The flyover was expanded again and an exit connected to Canal Road East. The flyovers currently connects Aberdeen Tunnel to the Cross Harbour Tunnel. They are a very important thoroughfare to conveniently reach Southern District and Happy Valley. From the Wan Chai Interchange, they pass (in order): Gloucester Road, Jaffe Road, Lockhart Road, Hennessy Road, Times Square, Sharp Street, Leighton Road, Queen's Road East, the Racing Museum and Wong Nai Chung Road. The area under this flyover was once visited by the second installment of Canadian television reality competition series, The Amazing Race Canada, where the U-Turn of the third leg was located. Villain hitting The area under the Canal Road Flyover, adjacent to Hennessy Road, is known for the old ladies who offer villain hitting services, in which personal enemies are cursed by beating pieces of paper representing them. The practice is especially popular during Jingzhe (typically in March).

Biography Born in the village of Zheravna, Yovkov studied at First Sofia Men‚Äôs High School, from which he graduated in 1900 with honors, and became a teacher. After teaching for one year in a village in central Bulgaria he entered into the School for Reserve Officers in Knyazhevo as a cadet, before moving to Sofia University to study law in 1904. When the First Balkan War began in 1912, he received was enlisted and, along with his brother Kosta, joined the 41st division (probably 41st regiment) at Bourgas. He was wounded by a bullet in his leg fighting in the Second Balkan War in 1913, during a battle near Doyran. Following this, he settled in Sofia and became an editor of the People‚Äôs Army (Narodna Armiya) magazine, and then librarian for the Minister of Interior Affairs and editor of a state publication. During World War, he was sent to work as a border officer at the Greek border near the Mesta River. Whilst there he received a summons to work as a correspondent for the paper Military News. He spent trying years teaching in Varna until the autumn of 1920, after which he served as a press secretary in the Bulgarian legislation in Bucharest. He was demoted in 1927 for unspecified reasons, which caused him to resign and return to Sofia. Literary work and legacy Yovkov‚Äôs war experiences greatly influenced his mentality and style of writing. Whereas his first literary effort was a short story about village life and patriarchal customs, published in 1910, his post-war pieces were more harsh and militaristic. Eventually he moved away from melancholic, depressive themes towards authentic descriptions of villagers and country life. In his short story Shibil, he used turkisms to give a sense of realism to the work. His works Legends of Stara Planina (1927, Staroplaninski legendi, alternately known as the Balkan Legends ) and Inn at Antimovo (1927) established him as a major writer. In 1929, he received the Cyril and Methodius Prize for Literature from the Bulgarian Academy of Science. His other works include the dramas Albena (1930) and Boryana (1932); a comedy The Millionaire (1930, Milionerut); and a book, The Family by the Frontier (1934, Chiflikut krai granitsata). \\"Albena\\" (1962) - libretto Peter Filchev (after the drama of Yordan Yovkov) and \\"Millionaire\\" (1965) were made into operas by Parashkev Hadjiev. A number of his stories were made into films, including Nai-vyarnata strazha (The Most Loyal Guard, film in 1929); Shibil (1968); Nona (1973, from the novel Chiflikut krai granitsata); and 24 Chasa duzhd (1982, based on the novel Chastinyat uchitel). Honors Yovkov‚Äôs natal home in Zheravna was turned into a museum in 1957. In 1985, a dam in northeastern Bulgaria was named after him. Yovkovtsi Dam, situated 5km from the town of Elena, supplies water to Veliko Turnovo and surrounding areas. It is 223,000 decares in size and is a hygienic protected zone. Yovkov Point on Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Yordan Yovkov. There is a bust of Yovkov in the park behind Vasil Levski National Stadium in Sofia.

The town is located on the designated road PM 810.\\"579 Regional Map, Spain, Islas Baleares.\\" Pub:Michelin Editions des Voyages, 2004, Santa Eul√†ria is the third largest town on the island and also has the only river on the island which flows into the sea at the western end of the town. Location The town is north east of Ibiza Town and of Ibiza Airport. The town sits next to a wide bay with the promontory of Punta Arab√≠ at the east end of the Bay. Also at the eastern end of the bay is new harbour, mariner called Port Esportiu which is full of restaurants, shops and bars. The town has two beaches which are kept clean and tidyThe Rough Guide to Ibiza & Formentera. Pub:Rough Guides, Penguin Group, 2003, and have gently sloping sands and are ideal for young families. At the western end of the bay is the prominent hill of ‚ÄòPuig d‚Äô en Fita‚Äô which dominates the landscape. The hill is dotted with apartments, hotels and private houses, and at night is dotted with the dwellings lights. The Town At the centre of the town on the ‚ÄòPla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya‚Äô is the Ajuntament (town hall) which is now one of the last historical buildings of the town. The present building, which has been renovated, dates from 1795 and reflects the typical architecture of the period on the island. Nowadays the building is less functional as a town hall and is used with a civic representative purpose. In front of the Ajuntament is a small square which has a fountain with a stone surround which faces the busy main street of ‚ÄòCarrer Saint Jaume‚Äô. Behind the fountain is a stone monument, erected by the city of Palma, Mallorca to thank and honour the local fishermen who, On 17 January 1913, rescued victims of the shipwrecked steamboat ‚ÄòMallorca‚Äô which had run aground on a reef near the rocky inlet of Redona at Punta Arab√≠. The town streets run grid like from the ‚ÄòPla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya‚Äô with the ‚ÄòCarrer Saint Jaume‚Äô running west to east. The ‚ÄòCarrer da Sant Vincent‚Äô runs parallel, one street back from ‚ÄòCarrer Saint Jaume‚Äô with the western end of ‚ÄòPla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya‚Äô. This street is pedestrianized and is filled with typical Tavernas and restaurants.Everyman MapGuide to Ibiza & Formentera. Pub:Alfred A Knopf, New York, 2004, There are also one or two lively bars. The ‚ÄòCarrer Saint Jaume‚Äô is full of stores, banks, bars and restaurants. The ‚ÄòPasseig de s‚ÄôAlamera‚Äô is an attractive thoroughfare which runs south from the ‚ÄòPla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya‚Äô down to the seafront. This boulevard has a tree lined central pedestrianized area with gardens. In the summer this shady ‚ÄòRamblas‚Äô is lined with market stalls selling jewellery, sarongs, tie-dye Thai garb and trinkets of all kinds. At the southern end of ‚ÄòPasseig de s‚ÄôAlamera‚Äô is Santa Eulalia's harbour front with views of the bay. Running in either direction is a paved and landscaped promenade. Below the promenade are the resorts two sandy beaches which have safe designated bathing areas which in the season are patrolled by lifeguards. Behind the promenade the bay is ringed by concrete apartment blocks, some of which have shops, bars, caf√© and restaurants opening on to the promenade. The River The river is called Riu de Santa Eulalia, it is more of a small stream and only ever becomes a raging torrent following very heavy rainfall. The source of the river is below the 342-metre-high Puig d‚Äôen Sopes close to Sant Miquel. The river then meanders for through the countryside to the sea at the western end of the town. A small way inland from the mouth of the river there is a small triple arched bridge, the Pont Vell, the bridge crosses the rocky valley and is claimed to have been built by the Romans as part of the imperial road building schemes on the island between 200 BC and AD 400, although the bridge's earliest mention is in a document of 1720. The river is also the only one of its kind in the Balearic Islands, and is fed by several small tributaries, notably the Torrent de Labritja, which originates at the northern village of Sant Joan de Labritja.Ibiza & Formentera‚Äôs Heritage, A Non-clubber‚Äôs Guide. Author: Paul R Davis Pub:Barbary Press, 2009, The Parish Church of Santa Eul√†ria To the west of the town centre is the hill called ‚ÄòPuig de Missa‚Äô. The hill is 52 metres above sea level and its summit is dominated by the Esgl√©sia de Puig de Missa. The church is dedicated to Saint Eulalia. The Path to the church spirals up around the hillside before arriving in a courtyard beside the church come Fortress. The Church is thought to have been built in 1568 although it is recorded that there was a chapel dedicated to the saint as far back as 1302. Despite the huge natural advantage of constructing the church on this hilltop, the small community of Santa Eul√†ria, employed the skills of military designer Giovanni Calvi to fortify the church you see here today. Calvi had a rounded bastion constructed in the style of the islands many watchtower although the church's bastion is solid and has no internal guardrooms. The churches nave roof is higher than the Bastion which restricted the range and scope of any cannon placed on the bastion, although it is thought that at one time the roof may have been lower than the bastion. The Porch of the church, added in the eighteenth century, is larger than most on the island and stands separate from the main church building. It has multiple pillars and rounded arches which has been compared to the Moorish style of architecture, and this does compare well with a mosque and its prayer halls still seen on main land Spain. The porch is probably the newest part of this church. On the west elevation of the church there is a small chapel which is topped with a plain stone dome complete with a lantern. This chapel is an addition to the original church, and is entered through a ponderous arch bored through the massively thick walls. The interior is square and rather small with the dome above supported on squat arches over each corner. The lantern above has stained glass lights. There is another similar chapel on the opposite wall which gives the nave a footprint in the shape of the crucifix. There is a gilded altarpiece which was brought and installed from Segovia in 1967. the rest of the church is very sparse and has been heavily restored due to the extreme damage done to the church by iconoclast Republicans during the Spanish Civil War of 1936 who viewed the church as a hotbed of sedition. Events =Ball Pag√®s= THE DANCES The roles of men and women are clearly differentiated in our dances. The woman, indifferent, holds her arms close to her body, walking with short and rapid steps, circling around a central point. The man, however, does not have previously determined steps. He tries to show his force and manliness by taking great leaps, in order to win the favour of the woman. The dances and the popular culture are part of rural, or country, society. The people who lived in and from the countryside did not have many opportunities for socialising or parties. The songs have a decidedly Oriental sound. The words have to be guessed, with syllables cut off so they fit into the monotonous and unvarying melody. Christian influence is perhaps the strongest. In 1235, Catalan men during the reign of Jaime I took the island from the Arabs. Its influence is seen in the jewels, the men's dress and the language we speak. In spite of the Christianisation of the dances and the inclusion of music in the liturgy, the profane nature of the same can be easily recognised. LA CURTA This is a short dance. The steps and the rhythm are suitable for the elderly. Generally, the elderly, the well owner with the heir to the house, or the in- laws of the couple marrying ‚Äì depending on the occasion ‚Äì started and finished the party with this dance, granting permission to the rest to continue. LA LLARGA Young people display their energy with this much faster dance. In almost all the dances, the dancer selects his partner with a bang on the castanets. This gesture, a quite rude way to issue an invitation to a woman, is forgiven at the end of the dance when the man kneels before her. The woman reciprocates with a small curtsy. SA FILERA A man dances with three women in a line. It seems like a wedding dance where the recently married bride is accompanied by two friends or ladies. The rhythm is the same as the Llarga. SES NOU RODADES This may be the prettiest and most important dance in our repertoire. Parties culminate with this dance and it is a nuptial ceremony. The newly married couple dance in a series of circles, separating and then meeting again in the centre, where they link elbows. After the sixth turn, the wife flashes her rings (twenty-four in total) that her husband has presented her. THE INSTRUMENTS The basic rhythm of our music is percussion and wind. It may seem surprising that such a Mediterranean island does not include string instruments in their music. The drum, the flute, the espas√≠ (a metal sword- shaped piece) and the castanets always accompany our dances and fiestas. THE DRUM A hollowed pine trunk. The outsides are adorned with carvings or paint, with red and green colours predominating here. The motifs are vegetal or geometric. The skin is made from rabbit. THE FLUTE An oleander branch hollowed out with fire. With only three holes, it is also adorned with vegetable and geometric shapes. This instrument requires greater skill, even though composers do not have a conventional knowledge of musical theory or other disciplines and play accompanied by the drum. THE ESPAS√ç A piece of metal in the shape of a sword. The stridency of the metal backs up the music. THE CASTANETS This may possibly be the strangest instrument, due to both its size and its sound. Created from juniper wood, they are carved with vegetable or geometric shapes using knives. While castanets are widely used throughout the Mediterranean, we use the largest ones available. The sound resembles a trotting horse. THE XEREMIA Another wind instrument, which was used principally by shepherds. It is created with two young bamboo shoots, with a vibrating reed. You can see an instrument identical to the xeremia at the British Museum in London, which is the Egyptian maid. Besides accompanying our dances, some of these instruments can be heard at religious celebrations and other solemn occasions. Ses Caramelles is the song played on Christmas Eve. Sa Pujadeta and Sa Calera are songs that are already classics and enjoy great popularity amongst the Ibizans. THE DRESS The originality and authenticity of some of the native dress styles offer some samples that are over three hundred years old. In the different villages of the island, similar to how the exact dance style varies, there are also small variations in dress. We can distinguish between three different types of dress, both for men and women, in accordance with their function and age. THE BLACK GONELLA This is the oldest dress for women, probably dating from the 18th century. It is a tunic of knitted wool, consisting of an underskirt, a serge jerkin with embroidered satin sleeves, silver buttons and coloured ribbons. This is topped with an apron, a yellow silk shawl and a cambuix, a lace scarf tied under the neck. It is usually worn with a black, felt, wide-brimmed hat. Jewels on the dress are silver and red coral. Gold, which was traditionally used, became scarce during this time. The jewels are affixed to the body with coloured, embroidered ribbons. THE WHITE GONELLA OR WHITE DRESS A luminous white colour, consisting of the same garments as the gonella (underskirts, jerkin, apron, shawl and scarf), but with some particularities. A hat is never worn. The bride layered on underskirts until their width no longer allowed her to pass through the door of her bedroom. The jewels are made from gold. This was generally the dowry that her family contributed to the wedding. The cross, la joia, hung with eighteen spans of golden braid (6 or 7 times over the chest) and two or three necklaces. The sleeves were adorned with gold buttons. The rings could be in different shapes - the family seal, the heart and key to the house, etc. These were gifts from her fianc√©e, with a total of twenty-four rings. COLOURED GONELLA OR COLOURED DRESS Old women that still wear this dress on a daily basis can be seen in isolated villages. On the day of the town festival, they wear their best dresses adorned with jewellery and then go to the church, following a long tradition. They have essentially the same clothing items, but the apron is normally long, short if undergarments are worn. It can be accompanied with a wide-brimmed hat made from pita fibres (capell de floc), with a yellow scarf, but never together with the undergarments. There are also three types of dress for the men. Recognised as the oldest, it seems to have come from a military uniform, and we can place it next to the gonella. Black holds prominence over white. A large rosary with silver and ebony beads is worn at the neck. The following is possibly the most popular. Worn for summer festivals, it is made with luminous white cloth and a highly embroidered shirt. The sash has bright colours and the waistcoat has silver button work: 14 or 24 buttons, depending on the man's wealth. Lastly, the most modern outfit that disappeared only quite recently, was worn by the elderly. All signs of ostentation have been suppressed here: there is no button work or adornments. It consists of a loose-fitting shirt closed only at the neck that goes over the inside shirt. Dark-coloured, and worn with a silk scarf, generally yellow. Topped by a black felt hat. All these dresses were worn with handmade pita-fibre espadrilles. The most common colours for men were red and white. Women put much more imagination into the colouring of their clothing. The jewels merit special mention. S'emprendada, a set of gold, silver and coral jewels, has an artistic and historical value much greater than their economic value. And we could not finish without mentioning the importance that dance, music and dress play within our culture and as an extremely relevant part of our entity. =Hippy Markets= There are two Hippy Markets which attract large numbers of tourists and locals: Punta Arabi, located in Es Canar runs all day every Wednesday from April through October. Las Dalias, near Sant Carles, runs all day every Saturday, throughout the year. Las Dalias also has a \\"Night Market\\" which runs Monday and Tuesday evenings from June through September.

Along with the Leo Cluster (Abell 1367), it is one of the two major clusters comprising the Coma Supercluster. It is located in and takes its name from the constellation Coma Berenices. The cluster's mean distance from Earth is 99 Mpc (321 million light years). Its ten brightest spiral galaxies have apparent magnitudes of 12‚Äì14 that are observable with amateur telescopes larger than 20 cm. The central region is dominated by two supergiant elliptical galaxies: NGC 4874 and NGC 4889. The cluster is within a few degrees of the north galactic pole on the sky. Most of the galaxies that inhabit the central portion of the Coma Cluster are ellipticals. Both dwarf and giant ellipticals are found in abundance in the Coma Cluster.Newswise: Hubble's Sweeping View of the Coma Cluster of Galaxies Retrieved on June 11, 2008. Cluster members Tails in spiral galaxy D100, found in the Coma Cluster, are created by ram-pressure stripping. As is usual for clusters of this richness, the galaxies are overwhelmingly elliptical and S0 galaxies, with only a few spirals of younger age, and many of them probably near the outskirts of the cluster. The full extent of the cluster was not understood until it was more thoroughly studied in the 1950s by astronomers at Mount Palomar Observatory, although many of the individual galaxies in the cluster had been identified previously. Dark matter The Coma Cluster is one of the first places where observed gravitational anomalies were considered to be indicative of unobserved mass. In 1933 Fritz Zwicky showed that the galaxies of the Coma Cluster were moving too fast for the cluster to be bound together by the visible matter of its galaxies. Though the idea of dark matter would not be accepted for another fifty years, Zwicky wrote that the galaxies must be held together by some dunkle Materie. About 90% of the mass of the Coma cluster is believed to be in the form of dark matter. However, the distribution of dark matter throughout the cluster is poorly constrained. X-ray source An extended X-ray source centered at 1300+28 in the direction of the Coma cluster of galaxies was reported before August 1966. This X-ray observation was performed by balloon, but the source was not detected in the sounding rocket flight launched by the X-ray astronomy group at the Naval Research Laboratory on November 25, 1964. A strong X-ray source was observed by the X-ray observatory satellite Uhuru close to the center of the Coma cluster and this source was suggested to be designated Coma X-1. The Coma cluster contains about 800 galaxies within a 100 x 100 arc-min area of the celestial sphere. The source near the center at RA (1950) 12h56m ¬± 2m Dec 28¬∞6' ¬± 12' has a luminosity Lx = 2.6 x 1044 ergs/s. As the source is extended, with a size of about 45', this argues against the possibility that a single galaxy is responsible for the emission. The Uhuru observations indicated a source strength of no greater than ~10‚àí3 photons cm‚àí2s‚àí1keV‚àí1 at 25 keV, which disagrees with the earlier observations claiming a source strength of ~10‚àí2 photons cm‚àí2s‚àí1keV‚àí1 at 25 keV, and a size of 5¬∞.

Yidgha is similar to the Munji language spoken on the Afghan side of the border. The Garam Chashma area became important during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan because the Soviets were unable to stop the flow of arms and men back and forth across the Dorah Pass that separates Chitral from Badakshan in Afghanistan. Almost the entire Munji- speaking population of Afghanistan fled across the border to Chitral during the War in Afghanistan.  Study  The Yidgha language has not been given serious study by linguists, except that it is mentioned by Georg Morgenstierne (1926), Kendall Decker (1992) and Badshah Munir Bukhari (2005). A 280-page joint description of Yidgha and Munji (descriptive and historical phonetics and grammar, glossary with etymologies where possible) is given by Morgenstierne (1938). Norwegian linguist Georg Morgenstierne wrote that Chitral is the area of the greatest linguistic diversity in the world. Although Khowar is the predominant language of Chitral, more than ten other languages are spoken here. These include Kalasha-mun, Palula, Dameli, Gawar- Bati, Nuristani, Yidgha, Burushaski, Wakhi, Kyrgyz, and Pashto.

Background Styled Lord Roos from birth, he was born at Knightsbridge, London, the eldest son of Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland, by Lady Mary Isabella Somerset, daughter of Charles Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort. He was the grandson of John Manners, Marquess of Granby, and the brother of Lord Charles Manners and Lord Robert Manners. He became known as the Marquess of Granby when his father succeeded to the dukedom in 1779. In 1787 he himself succeeded to the dukedom on the death of his father. Public life Rutland was Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire between 1799 and 1857. He was also a prominent owner and breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses. His most successful horse was Cadland, which won The Derby in 1828. Rutland was fictionalized as \\"the duke\\" in Benjamin Disraeli's novel Coningsby. His two sons also figured as \\"the marquis of Beaumanoir\\" and \\"Lord Henry Sidney\\". There is a bronze statue of him in the Market Place, Leicester which was erected on this site in 1852 after having been previously exhibited at the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace, London in 1851. It was the first public statue to be erected in Leicester, and was unveiled by Sir Frederick Gustavus Fowke, Provincial Grand Master of Freemasons for the Province of Leicestershire, on 28 April 1852. It was sculpted by Edward Davis. It is marked \\" EDW DAVIS Simonet & Fils / Fondeurs Paris 1851\\".

Description It is distinguished from U. t. thibetanus by its longer, thicker fur and smaller, whiter chest mark. During the summer, black bears can be found in warmer areas in Nepal, China, Bhutan, India and Tibet at altitudes of up near the timberline. For winter, they descend as low as , to more tropical forests. On average, they measure from nose to tail and weigh from , though they may weigh as much as in the fall, when they are fattening up for hibernation. Behaviour and ecology Bears playing or fighting in the water =Diet= They are omnivorous creatures and will eat just about anything. Their diet consists of acorns, nuts, fruit, honey, roots, and various insects such as termites and beetle larvae. If food is scarce, they may turn to eating livestock such as sheep, goats, and cattle. =Breeding= They reach sexual maturity at approximately three years. Mating occurs in October with usually two cubs born in February, while the mother is still hibernating. The offspring usually stay with their mother into the second year. Status This subspecies is listed as 'vulnerable' due to encroachment of human population, forest fires and the timber industries; these have all reduced the bear's habitat. There is also a high mortality rate among the newborn. And even though hunting of the black bear has been forbidden since 1977, there is still a large problem with poaching.

It was named for William Wrightson, a miner and entrepreneur in the region killed by Apaches in the 1865 Battle of Fort Buchanan. Geography Mt. Wrightson is the highest point in the Santa Rita Mountains and the Tucson region, lying southeast of the city. Its distinctive pyramid-shaped profile is visible from much of southeastern Arizona and adjoining areas in Sonora, Mexico. The mountain is known for the views from its barren peak, nearly feet above Tucson. Flora Mt. Wrightson's flora includes grassy, high desert chaparral, mixed conifers with Arizona, Apache, and Chihuahua pines, Arizona madrone, aspen, oak brush, and Douglas fir and ponderosa pine near the summit. Fauna Fauna on Mt. Wrightson include birds such as the scrub jay and ravens high up near the peak, Coues white-tailed deer, black bear, and (rarely) mountain lion. Mount Wrightson viewed from the south, at one of the main saddles. Looking up, close to the summit of Wrightson (April 2016). Hiking The shortest route is the Old Baldy Trail, a steady climb of over over to the exposed summit. The Super Trail, also from the Madera Canyon trailhead, is not as steep but is far longer at . These two trails intersect at Josephine Saddle () halfway to the peak, so hikers can choose one route for the lower path and one route for the upper. To reach the trailhead, take exit 63 off of I-19 south of Tucson, and turn east toward Continental. Turn right on Whitehouse Cyn. Rd, following it until it eventually turns into Madera Canyon Road. Parking is plentiful at and below the trailhead, which is at the end of the road. There are several springs at different locations, including Bog Spring, Sprung Spring, Kent Spring, Armour Spring, Baldy Spring, McBeth Spring and Bellows Spring. Nonetheless, take plenty of water and be aware of wildlife. It is a prime birding area and black bears are common. Two miles into the hike is a saddle which offers an easy dayhike with dramatic views of this peak. It features a Boy Scout Memorial dedicated and maintained for three scouts who died in a storm on Mt. Wrightson November 15, 1958. According to the sign, the plaque was erected by Boy Scout Troop 249 in remembrance of David Greenberg (age 12), Mike Early (age 16), and Michael J. Lanoue (age 13). The final approach to the summit is north facing and may be impassable without special equipment during the winter due to ice. The \\"Florida Fire\\" in 2005 burned a large expanse of the forest in this area, affecting much of this hike, especially the section between the Walker Basin trail and the Super Trail.

Bowen was among the pioneers of family therapy and a noted founder of systemic therapy. Beginning in the 1950s he developed a systems theory of the family.  Biography  Murray Bowen (Lucius Murray Bowen) was born in 1913 as the oldest of five and grew up in the small town of Waverly, Tennessee, where his father was the mayor for some time.Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Bowen by Murray Bowen, Washington, D.C. January 1990: Dr. Bowen gave here a brief overview in his own vita. There are many other papers and audio plus video tapes available at the National Library of Medicine and at the Bowen Center for the Study of the Family. Both are located in Washington, DC. Bowen earned his B.S. in 1934 at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. He received his MD in 1937 at the Medical School of the University of Tennessee in Memphis. After that, he had internships at Bellevue Hospital in New York City in 1938 and at the Grasslands Hospital, Valhalla, New York, from 1939 to 1941. From 1941 to 1946, he did his military training followed by five years of active duty with Army in the United States and Europe. During the war, while working with soldiers, his interest changed from surgery to psychiatry. Though he had been accepted for a post-military fellowship in surgery at the Mayo Clinic, in 1946 he started at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas, as a fellow in psychiatry and personal psychoanalysis. This psychiatric training and experience lasted until 1954.His background in science led to his formation of a new theory of psychotherapy that used systems ideas in place of Freudian concepts. From 1954 to 1959, Bowen worked at the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, where he continued to develop the theory that would be named after him: Bowen Theory. At that time, family therapy was still only a by-product of theory. Bowen did his initial research on parents who lived with one adult schizophrenic child, which he thought could provide a paradigm for all children. After defining the field of family therapy he started integrating new concepts with the theory, noting that none of this had previously been addressed in the psychological literature. His approach gained national attention within two years of its introduction. From 1959 to 1990 he worked at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington DC as a clinical professor at the department of psychiatry, and later as director of family programs and founder of a Family Center. He had a half-time research and teaching appointment. His research focused on human interactions rather than symptomatic cubicles. Bowen even focused on the prodromal states that precede medical diagnoses. For Bowen each concept was extended, and woven into physical, emotional, and social illness. Bowen criticized psychiatry's penchant for diagnosing and treating mental illness as of limited usefulness and ultimately a dead end. This new work went beyond other family systems theories, and contrasted sharply with Freudian theory. In addition to his research and teaching, Bowen had other faculty appointments and consultancies. He was visiting professor in a variety of medical schools, including at the University of Maryland from 1956 to 1963 and at the Medical College of Virginia at Richmond from 1964 to 1978. He was a life fellow at the American Psychiatric Association and at the American Orthopsychiatric Association, and a life member at the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. He was on the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1961 and first president at the American Family Therapy Association. Murray Bowen received multiple awards and recognitions, including: * 1978-1982, Originator and First President, American Family Therapy Association. * 1985 June, Alumnus of the Year, Menninger Foundation. * 1985 December, Faculty, Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference, Erickson Foundation, Phoenix, * 1986 June, Graduation Speaker, Menninger School of Psychiatry, * 1986, Governor's Certificate, Tennessee Homecoming ‚Äò86, Knoxville. * 1986 October, Distinguished Alumnus Award, University of Tennessee-Knoxville. Bowen was the first president of the American Family Therapy Association from 1978 to 1982. He died of lung cancer in 1990. In November 2002, Bowen's papers were donated to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The collection of 125 boxes is stored offsite.

This book contains some twenty years of his theoretical work. Successive adherents of Bowen Natural Family Systems Theory point to the 1988 text Family Evaluation: An Approach Based on Bowen Theory, co-written with Dr. Bowen's heir apparent spokesperson/successor/colleague, Dr. Michael E.

Until 1984 the regiment was equipped with the MiG-23M, and from 1984-1992 with the Su-24. The regiment was under control of the Air Forces of the Turkestan Military District from April 1980 to May 1988, and then under 49th Air Army and 73rd Air Army. On June 30, 1992, control of the base passed from the dissolved Soviet Union to Uzbekistan. From 1992 changes began to affect the regiment before it was merged with other units into the 60th Separate Mixed Aviation Brigade. Between 2001 and 2005 seven thousand United States Department of Defense personnel were assigned to the base, also known as K2 and \\"Stronghold Freedom\\", for support missions against al-Qaeda in neighbouring Afghanistan. The 416th Air Expeditionary Group was the host unit. On July 29, 2005, amid strained relations caused by the May 2005 unrest in Uzbekistan, the United States was told to vacate the base within six months.

It is native to parts of sub- Saharan Africa. First formally described by Albert G√ºnther in 1864, it is the second-longest venomous snake after the king cobra; mature specimens generally exceed and commonly grow to . Specimens of have been reported. Its skin colour varies from grey to dark brown. Juvenile black mambas tend to be paler than adults and darken with age. The species is both terrestrial (ground-living) and arboreal (tree-living); it inhabits savannah, woodland, rocky slopes and in some regions, dense forest. It is diurnal and is known to prey on birds and small mammals. Over suitable surfaces, it can move at speeds up to for short distances. Adult black mambas have few natural predators. In a threat display, the black mamba usually opens its inky-black mouth, spreads its narrow neck- flap and sometimes hisses. It is capable of striking at considerable range and may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of neurotoxins that often induce symptoms within ten minutes, and is frequently fatal unless antivenom is administered. Despite its reputation as a formidable and highly aggressive species, the black mamba attacks humans only if it is threatened or cornered. It is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species. Taxonomy The first formal description of the black mamba was made in 1864 by German-born British zoologist Albert G√ºnther. A single specimen was one of many species of snake collected by John Kirk, a naturalist who accompanied David Livingstone on the 1858‚Äì1864 Second Zambesi expedition. This specimen is the holotype and is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. The generic name of the species is derived from the Ancient Greek words dendron (Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ), \\"tree\\", and aspis (·ºÄœÉœÄŒØœÇ) \\"asp\\", and the specific epithet polylepis is derived from the Ancient Greek poly (œÄŒøŒªœç) meaning \\"many\\" and lepis (ŒªŒµœÄŒØœÇ) meaning \\"scale\\". The term \\"mamba\\" is derived from the Zulu word \\"imamba\\" (meaning scales). In Tanzania, a local Ngindo name is ndemalunyayo (\\"grass-cutter\\") because it supposedly clips grass. In 1873, German naturalist Wilhelm Peters described Dendraspis Antinorii from a specimen in the museum of Genoa that had been collected by Italian explorer Orazio Antinori in what is now northern Eritrea. This was subsequently regarded as a subspecies and is no longer held to be distinct. In 1896, Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger combined the species Dendroaspis polylepis as a whole with the eastern green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps), a lumping diagnosis that remained in force until 1946 when South African herpetologist Vivian FitzSimons again split them into separate species. A 2016 genetic analysis showed the black and eastern green mambas are each other's closest relatives, and are more distantly related to Jameson's mamba (Dendroaspis jamesoni). Description The black interior of the mouth of a black mamba The black mamba is a long, slender, cylindrical snake. It has a coffin-shaped head with a somewhat pronounced brow ridge and a medium-sized eye. The adult snake's length typically ranges from but specimens have grown to lengths of . It is the second-longest venomous snake species, exceeded in length only by the king cobra. The black mamba is a proteroglyphous (front-fanged) snake, with fangs up to in length, located at the front of the maxilla. The tail of the species is long and thin, the caudal vertebrae making up 17‚Äì25% of its body length. The body mass of black mambas has been reported to be about , although a study of seven black mambas found an average weight of , ranging from for a specimen of total length to for a specimen of total length. Specimens vary considerably in colour, including olive, yellowish-brown, khaki and gunmetal but are rarely black. The scales of some individuals may have a purplish sheen. Individuals occasionally display dark mottling towards the posterior, which may appear in the form of diagonal crossbands. Black mambas have greyish-white underbellies. The common name is derived from the appearance of the inside of the mouth, dark bluish-grey to nearly black. Mamba eyes range between greyish-brown and shades of black; the pupil is surrounded by a silvery-white or yellow colour. Juvenile snakes are lighter in colour than adults; these are typically grey or olive green and darken as they age. =Scalation= The number and pattern of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The black mamba has between 23 and 25 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 248 to 281 ventral scales, 109 to 132 divided subcaudal scales, and a divided anal scale. Its mouth is lined with 7‚Äì8 supralabial scales above, with the fourth and sometimes also the third one located under the eye, and 10-14 sublabial scales below. Its eyes have 3 or occasionally 4 preocular and 2‚Äì5 postocular scales. Distribution and habitat Juvenile in a tree, Kruger National Park, South Africa The black mamba inhabits a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa; its range includes Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, and Angola. The black mamba's distribution in parts of West Africa has been disputed. In 1954, the black mamba was recorded in the Dakar region of Senegal. This observation, and a subsequent observation that identified a second specimen in the region in 1956, has not been confirmed and thus the snake's distribution in this area is inconclusive. The species prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops and semi-arid savanna. It also inhabits moist savanna and lowland forests. It is not commonly found at altitudes above , although its distribution does include locations at in Kenya and in Zambia. It is rated as a species of least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of endangered species, based on its huge range across sub-Saharan Africa and no documented decline. Behaviour and ecology A black mamba in defensive posture. Like cobras, the black mamba can spread its neck into a hood to intimidate potential threats (shown here). The black mamba is both terrestrial and arboreal. On the ground, it moves with its head and neck raised, and typically uses termite mounds, abandoned burrows, rock crevices and tree cracks as shelter. Black mambas are diurnal; in South Africa, they are recorded to bask between 7 and 10 am and again from 2 to 4 pm. They may return daily to the same basking site. Skittish and often unpredictable, the black mamba is agile and can move quickly. In the wild, black mambas seldom tolerate humans approaching more closely than about . When it perceives a threat, it retreats into brush or a hole. When confronted it is likely to engage in a threat display, gaping to expose its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to hiss and spread its neck into a hood similar to that of the cobras in the genus Naja. During the threat display, any sudden movement by the intruder may provoke the snake into performing a series of rapid strikes, leading to severe envenomation. The size of the black mamba and its ability to raise its head a large distance from the ground enables it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites to humans can occur on the upper body. The black mamba's reputation for being ready to attack is exaggerated; it is usually provoked by perceived threats such as the blocking of its movements and ability to retreat. The species' reputed speed has also been exaggerated; it cannot move more quickly than .Animal Diversity Web (ADW), University of Michigan =Reproduction and lifespan= Male black mambas engaged in combat The black mamba's breeding season spans from September to February, following the drop in temperature which occurs from April to June. Rival males compete by wrestling, attempting to subdue each other by intertwining their bodies and wrestling with their necks. Some observers have mistaken this for courtship. During mating, the male will slither over the dorsal side of the female while flicking its tongue. The female will signal its readiness to mate by lifting its tail and staying still. The male will then coil itself around the posterior end of the female and align its tail ventrolaterally with the female's. Intromission may last longer than two hours and the pair remain motionless apart from occasional spasms from the male. The black mamba is oviparous; the female lays a clutch of 6‚Äì17 eggs. The eggs are elongated oval in shape, typically long and in diameter. When hatched, the young range from in length. They may grow quickly, reaching after their first year. Juvenile black mambas are very apprehensive and can be deadly like the adults. The black mamba is recorded to live up to 11 years and may live longer. =Feeding= The black mamba usually hunts from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return if there is no disturbance. It mostly preys on small vertebrates such as birds, particularly nestlings and fledglings, and small mammals like rodents, bats, hyraxes and bushbabies. They generally prefer warm-blooded prey but will also consume other snakes. In the Transvaal area of South Africa, almost all recorded prey was rather small, largely consisting of rodents and similarly sized small or juvenile mammals as well as passerine birds, estimated to weigh only 1.9‚Äì7.8% of the mamba's body mass. Nonetheless, anecdotes have indicated that large black mambas may at times infrequently attack large prey such as rock hyrax or dassies, and in some tribal languages, its name even means \\"dassie catcher\\".Pienaar, U. D. V., Haacke, W. D., & Jacobsen, N. H. G. (1966). The Reptiles of the Kruger National Park (p. 223). National Parks Board of Trustees of the Republic of South Africa.Jacobsen, N. H. G. (1985). Ons reptiele. CUM boeke, Roodepert. The black mamba does not typically hold onto its prey after biting; rather it releases its quarry and waits for it to succumb to paralysis and death before it swallows. The snake's potent digestive system has been recorded to fully digest prey in eight to ten hours. =Predation= Adult mambas have few natural predators aside from birds of prey. Brown snake eagles are verified predators of adult black mambas, of up to at least .Steyn, P. (1983). Birds of prey of southern Africa: Their identification and life histories. Croom Helm, Beckenham (UK). 1983. Other eagles known to hunt or at least consume grown black mambas include tawny eagles and martial eagles. Young snakes have been recorded as prey of the Cape file snake. Mongooses, which have some resistance to mamba venom and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes take a black mamba for prey. The similarly predatory honey badger also has some resistance to mamba venom. The mechanism in both mammals is thought to be that their muscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors do not bind snake alpha-neurotoxins. Black mambas have also been found amongst the stomach contents of Nile crocodiles. Young mambas in the Serengeti are known to fall prey to southern ground hornbills, marsh owls and hooded vultures. Venom The black mamba is the most feared snake in Africa because of its size, aggression, venom toxicity and speed of onset of symptoms following envenomation, and is classified as a snake of medical importance by the World Health Organization. A survey in South Africa from 1957 to 1979 recorded 2553 venomous snakebites, 75 of which were confirmed as being from black mambas. Of these 75 cases, 63 had symptoms of systemic envenomation and 21 died. Those bitten before 1962 received a polyvalent antivenom that had no effect on black mamba venom, and 15 of 35 people who received the antivenom died. A mamba-specific antivenom was introduced in 1962, followed by a fully polyvalent antivenom in 1971. Over this period, 5 of 38 people bitten by black mambas and given antivenom died. A census in rural Zimbabwe in 1991 and 1992 revealed 274 cases of snakebite, of which 5 died. Black mambas were confirmed in 15 cases, of which 2 died. The peak period for deaths is the species' breeding season from September to February, during which black mambas are most irritable. Bites are very rare outside Africa; snake handlers and enthusiasts are the usual victims. Unlike many venomous snake species, black mamba venom does not contain protease enzymes. Its bites do not generally cause local swelling or necrosis, and the only initial symptom may be a tingling sensation in the area of the bite. The snake tends to bite repeatedly and let go, so there can be multiple puncture wounds. Its bite can deliver about 100‚Äì120 mg of venom on average; the maximum recorded dose is 400 mg. The murine median lethal dose (LD50) when administered intravenously has been calculated at 0.32 and 0.33 mg/kg. Bites were often fatal before antivenom was widely available. The venom is predominantly neurotoxic, and symptoms often become apparent within ten minutes. Early neurological signs that indicate severe envenomation include a metallic taste, drooping eyelids (ptosis) and gradual symptoms of bulbar palsy. Other neurological symptoms include miosis, blurred or diminished vision, paresthesia, dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnea, difficulty handling saliva, an absent gag reflex, fasciculations, ataxia, vertigo, drowsiness and loss of consciousness, and respiratory paralysis. Other more general symptoms include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sweating, salivation, goosebumps and red eyes. The bite of a black mamba can cause collapse in humans within 45 minutes or less. Without appropriate antivenom treatment, symptoms typically progress to respiratory failure, which leads to cardiovascular collapse and death. This typically occurs in 7 to 15 hours. In 2015, the proteome (complete protein profile) of black mamba venom was assessed and published, revealing 41 distinct proteins and one nucleoside. The venom is composed of two main families of toxic agents, dendrotoxins (I and K) and (at a slightly lower proportion) three-finger toxins. Dendrotoxins are akin to kunitz-type protease inhibitors that interact with voltage-dependent potassium channels, stimulating acetylcholine and causing an excitatory effect, and are thought to cause symptoms such as sweating. Member of the three-finger family include alpha-neurotoxin, cardiotoxins, fasciculins and mambalgins. The most toxic components are the alpha-neurotoxins, which bind nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and hence block the action of acetylcholine at the postsynaptic membrane and cause neuromuscular blockade and hence paralysis. Fasciculins are anticholinesterase inhibitors that cause muscle fasciculation. The venom has little or no haemolytic, haemorrhagic or procoagulant activity. Mambalgins act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain- inhibiting effect. There is research interest in their analgesic potential. A black mamba swallowing prey The composition of black mamba venom differs markedly from those of other mambas, all of which contain predominantly three- finger toxin agents. It is thought this may reflect the preferred prey items ‚Äì small mammals for the mainly land-dwelling black mamba versus birds for the predominantly arboreal other mambas. Unlike many snake species, black mamba venom has little phospholipase A2 content. =Treatment= Standard first aid treatment for any suspected bite from a venomous snake is the application of a pressure bandage to the bite site, minimisation of movement of the victim and conveyance to a hospital or clinic as quickly as possible. The neurotoxic nature of black mamba venom means an arterial tourniquet may be of benefit. Tetanus toxoid is sometimes administered, though the main treatment is the administration of the appropriate antivenom. A polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research is used to treat black mamba bites, and a new antivenom was being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado. =Notable bite cases= * Danie Pienaar, who was at various times from at least 2009 to 2017 head of South African National Parks Scientific Services and acting managing executive, survived the bite of a black mamba without antivenom in 1998. Despite the hospital physicians having declared it a \\"moderate\\" envenomation, Pienaar lapsed into a coma at one point and his prognosis was declared \\"poor\\". Upon arrival at the hospital, Pienaar was immediately intubated and placed on life support for three days. He was released from the hospital on the fifth day. Remaining calm after being bitten increased his chances of survival, as did the application of a tourniquet. * In March 2008, 28-year-old British trainee safari guide Nathan Layton was bitten by a black mamba that had been found near his classroom at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar and first aid-trained staff who examined him determined he could carry on with lectures. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Layton complained of blurred vision within an hour of being bitten, and collapsed and died shortly afterwards. * American professional photographer Mark Laita was bitten on the leg by a black mamba during a photo-shoot of a black mamba at a facility in Central America. Bleeding profusely, he did not seek medical attention, and except for intense pain and local swelling overnight, he was not affected. This led him to believe that either the snake gave him a \\"dry bite\\" (a bite without injecting venom) or the heavy bleeding pushed the venom out. Some commenters on the story suggested that it was a venomoid snake (in which the venom glands are surgically removed), but Laita responded that it was not. Only later did Laita find that he had captured the snake biting his leg in a photograph. * In 2016, Kenyan woman Cheposait Adomo was attacked by three black mambas, one of which bit her repeatedly on the leg, in West Pokot County, Kenya. People coming to her aid drove off the other snakes, hacking two with a machete. After an attempt at using traditional medicine, they placed her on a motorcycle and conveyed her 45 minutes to the nearest hospital, which had antivenom. She survived. * Prominent South African anti- Apartheid activist and Labour Court judge Anton Steenkamp died after being bitten by a black mamba while on leave in Zambia in May 2019. He was several hours away from medical help and died before antivenom could be administered. * In June 2020, Bulgarian veterinarian Georgi Elenski from Haskovo was bitten by a black mamba that was part of his personal collection of exotic animals. His initial condition was very serious, but he was able to recover after extensive treatment involving the administering of antivenom and respiratory support.

As part of the Coronado National Forest, Madera Canyon has campsites, picnic areas, and miles of hiking trails. The canyon is also used as a resting place for migrating birds, and it is thus known as a premier birdwatching area. Madera Canyon was originally named White House Canyon, after a prominent white adobe house was built there in the late 19th century. The canyon was renamed sometime in the early 1900s, although some locals still use the original name. Flora and fauna Bat houses in the canyon Madera Canyon is located in the Santa Rita Mountains, which is one of the largest of the Madrean Sky Islands. The canyon and its immediate surroundings are therefore home to wide variety of flora and fauna, ranging from cactus covered desert in the lower reaches of the canyon to aspen and pine forest on Mount Wrightson. With fifteen species of hummingbirds, elegant trogon, sulphur-bellied flycatcher, black-capped gnatcatcher, flame-colored tanager, thirty-six species of wood warblers, and over 256 species of birds documented in total, Madera Canyon is rated the third best birding destination in the United States. Other animals that can be found in Madera Canyon include black bear, mountain lion, bobcats, white- tailed and mule deer, foxes, coatis, ring-tailed cats, raccoons, wild turkeys, squirrels, and rabbits. Sixteen species of bats have also been recorded in the canyon. ;Life Zones Madera Canyon is a bowl-shaped watershed. Side-canyons funnel water from springs and runoff in seasonal streams that feed Madera Creek. This stream system and the abundant plants along its banks form a riparian corridor. The corridor descends through all of the canyon's four life zones and creates excellent wildlife habitat. * Lower Sonoran Zone (0 to 4,500 feet) ‚Äì This life zone extends from above the mouth of Madera Canyon down to the Santa Cruz Valley. Sonoran Desert scrub with desert trees, shrubs, and cactus grows in hot, dry lower elevations. A transition to desert grassland with grasses, shrubs and velvet mesquite occurs as temperature and moisture moderate higher up. * Upper Sonoran Zone (4,500 to 6,500 feet) ‚Äì Arising around the canyon mouth, this zone is cooler and more moist than the Lower Sonoran below. It is composed primarily of two woodland plant communities and represented by plants such as evergreen oaks, alligator juniper, Mexican pi√±on pine, shrubs, and bunchgrasses. * Transition Zone (6,500 to 8,000 feet) ‚Äì With mild summers and cold winters, the temperate Transition Zone is characterized by many plants common to the Rocky Mountains. Ponderosa pine, deciduous Gambel oak, smooth sumac, maples, and other mountain species grow in the upper canyon. * Canadian Zone (8,000 to 9,500 feet) ‚Äì The highest and coolest life zone in the Santa Rita Mountains occurs on the lofty peaks above the canyon. Plants such as Douglas fir, white fir, quaking aspen, and kinnikinnick grow in this high altitude zone. History USGS map of southeastern Arizona including Madera Creek, 1910. A bedrock mortar along Madera Creek. The Santa Rita Mountains were filled with prospectors in the early 1900s, with over a dozen mines operating in Madera Canyon alone. One was owned by a colorful character named Ben Daniels, who had once served as a marshal in Dodge City, Tombstone, and other rough Western towns, and had fought in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War with the Rough Riders. Daniels later built a home in Madera Canyon and was elected sheriff of Pima County in 1920. His wife became the Pima County Superintendent of Schools. The Pennington family lived in the area in the 1870s and a daughter, Josephine, was kidnapped by Apaches, tortured, and left for dead. She survived and made it back to her family. Josephine Peak bears her name. Other well-known places are named after miners, ranchers, and settlers. Sprung Spring was named after the Sprung family, for it is thought that it was they who first improved it. Mount Wrightson was originally named 'Old Baldy' after Captain Richard Ewell, who bore the same name, and was stationed at Ft. Buchanan in the 1850s. But his service in the CSA denied his name being attached to the peak. William Wrightson, who brought Arizona's first press around South America, and who later ventured in mining, was killed alongside of Gilbert Hopkins in 1865. It was their names which were assigned to the two prominent mountains nearby. In 1905, Madera Canyon and the Santa Rita Mountains became a part of the new National Forest System. In 1911, a Tucson businessman formed a group of backers who built several cabins in the canyon on land leased from the United States Forest Service (USFS). Over the next few years, the roads were improved, automobiles came into use and Madera Canyon became a popular summer destination. In 1922, the Santa Rita Trails Resort was built. The original lodge later burned down, but in 1929 it was rebuilt as a year-round resort with cottages, cabins, a restaurant, a general store, a gas station and a post office. In the 1930s, Madera Canyon was home to a Civilian Conservation Corps camp. Many of the rock walls they built still exist. The USFS continued to develop utilities and improve roads, but eventually the impact of people in the canyon led to erosion, sewage, and water supply problems. It was decided that the houses on leased land had to be removed. Over fifty cabins were demolished between 1984 and 1991. The few remaining homes in Madera Canyon are on private land. The White House in the late 1880s. ;The White House The remains of the White House in 2014. The White House was one of the \\"first permanent structures\\" built in Madera Canyon. It is thought to have been constructed by a sheepherder named Walden in the late 1870s or early 1880s. Walden left around 1882 and the two or three room house was taken over by Theodore Wellish and his family as a summer retreat. Wellish owned the White House Mercantile Company in Tucson, and thus it was assumed that he was the one who whitewashed the adobe building, giving it its name. The White House was well known and easily recognizable, and so it became a landmark for determining the location of the many different mining claims in and around the area. Two brothers named Atondo and Rufino Paz also lived at the White House at different times around the turn of the century. After their marriage in 1911, the sixty-one-year-old Alcaro Morales, and his twenty-seven- year-old bride named Benita, moved into the house. Alcaro delivered their five children in the home. Tragically, both Benita and her fifth child died during childbirth in 1921. She and her newborn son were buried together in a small plot near the house. The rest of the family continued to live in the house until Alcaro's death in 1940 at the age of ninety. In 2002, the USFS and the non-profit organization Friends Of Madera Canyon conducted an archeological dig at the site of the house. Only a small portion of one wall remains standing, but they were able to determine where the outside walls and the house's front door had been. The site of the house is near the Proctor Road crossing in Madera Canyon, and can be accessed by a short, paved pathway.

Incumbent Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani could not run again due to term limits. As Democrats outnumbered Republicans by a five-to-one margin in the city, it was widely believed that a Democrat would succeed him in City Hall. Businessman Michael Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat, changed his party affiliation and ran as a Republican. Mark J. Green narrowly defeated Fernando Ferrer in the Democratic primary, surviving a negative contest that divided the party and consumed the vast majority of the Green campaign's financial resources. After a campaign that was largely overshadowed by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Bloomberg won the general election with 50.3% of the vote to Green's 47.9%. Background The primaries originally began on September 11. However, the September 11 attacks caused the primary to be postponed until September 25 (votes cast on September 11 were not counted), and the run-off occurred on October 11.http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/results.html https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/12/nyregion/12MAYO.html Late in the primary, Green was roundly criticized for the actions of supporters that were construed as racist, involving literature with New York Post caricatures of Ferrer and Al Sharpton distributed in white enclaves of Brooklyn and Staten Island. Green stated that he had nothing to do with the dissemination of the literature. An investigation by the Brooklyn District Attorney came to the conclusion that \\"Mark Green had no knowledge of these events, and that when he learned of them, he repeatedly denounced the distribution of this literature and sought to find out who had engaged in it.\\" Nevertheless, the incident is thought to have diminished minority turnout in the general election and helped the Republican candidate win in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. (Village Voice columnist Peter Noel wrote that \\"Mark Green... may have replaced [Giuliani] as the most hated white man in the African American community,\\" an ironic twist for someone who had been so popular in that community for so long.) The September 11 terrorist attacks occurred on the morning that the primary election was first attempted (it was halted and held two weeks later) and also may have contributed to Green's loss, since the media barely covered the subsequent general election.

Bloomberg at City Hall yesterday provides Mr. Bloomberg with perhaps his greatest hope for victory as he moves into the final days of what his supporters describe as a troubled campaign.\\" Green made a controversial decision during the primary run-off to support Giuliani's unprecedented attempt to extend his own mayoral term, in the name of the emergency of 9/11. Ferrer opposed Giuliani's ultimately unsuccessful attempt at term self- extension, and was able to accuse Green of being rolled over by Giuliani. Unlike his cash-poor Democratic rival, who had just emerged from an expensive primary and expected to rely on traditionally reliable free media coverage that never materialized, Bloomberg continued to spend $74 million on TV ads and direct mail in the weeks after the attacks, which was a record amount at the time for a non-presidential election (Bloomberg would break his own record in 2005).http://marketing-case-studies.blogspot.com/2008/04/got-milk- campaign.html The Economist wrote, \\"The billionaire businessman [Bloomberg] is usually seen as one of the post-September 11th winners (if such a word can be so used): he would probably have lost the mayoralty to Mark Green, a leftish Democrat, had the terrorist strike not happened.

Green posed on the steps of City Hall with Hasidic Jewish leaders and issued a statement saying that \\"leaders from the Satmar Congregations of New York City, the largest of the three major Hasidic groups in the city with some 100,000 followers\\" supported his mayoral campaign. But many of the Satmars at that photo op led an upstate Satmar community ineligible to vote in New York City, and were also \\"at odds with the Satmar establishment\\" based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, whose leaders were in Europe at the time and unaware that Green had claimed their endorsements. The election was also notable for two non-politician semi- celebrities running on third-party tickets: Bernhard Goetz, who had achieved fame in 1984 as the \\"subway vigilante\\" for shooting four young men who tried to rob him, on the Fusion Party ticket, and Kenny Kramer, who was the inspiration for the character Cosmo Kramer on the TV show Seinfeld, on the Libertarian Party ticket. General election results Bloomberg secured victory in a close election, with 744,757 votes. Although he lost in three of the five boroughs, he was able to collect enough votes in Staten Island and Queens to prevail. Under New York's electoral fusion rules, candidates were allowed to run representing multiple parties.

He developed structural family therapy, which addresses problems within a family by charting the relationships between family members, or between subsets of family (Minuchin, 1974). These charts represent power dynamics as well as the boundaries between different subsystems. The therapist tries to disrupt dysfunctional relationships within the family, and cause them to settle back into a healthier pattern. Career Salvador Minuchin served as a physician in the Israeli army after obtaining his degree in medicine. Once his service was finished, he traveled to New York City to be trained in child psychiatry with Nathan Ackerman. When his training with Ackerman was complete, Minuchin returned to Israel to assist displaced children as a child psychiatrist (Nichols, 2010). In 1954 he returned to the United States to be trained in psychoanalysis at the William Alanson White Institute. After completing his psychoanalytic training, Minuchin worked as a child psychiatrist at the Wiltwyck School for delinquent boys, where he decided that treating whole families would be worthwhile. While he held his position at the Wiltwyck School, Minuchin developed a form of family therapy with his co-workers. Their method involved Minuchin or another psychiatrist performing a therapy session with a family while the other psychiatrists viewed the session through a one- way mirror (Nichols, 2010). Observing one another work allowed the therapists to learn techniques easily and led Minuchin to develop structural family therapy. In 1962, once Minuchin had generated his theoretical formulations for family structure, he traveled to Palo Alto to work with Jay Haley. Minuchin's work at the Wiltwyck School led to his first book, Families of the Slums (1967), which outlined his theoretical model of family therapy. In 1965 Minuchin became the director of the Child Guidance Clinic in Philadelphia. He stepped down from this position in 1976 to become the head of training at the center until 1981, when he left Philadelphia to practice and teach child psychiatry in New York (Nichols, 2010). In 1996, he moved to Boston and retired from his career. Minuchin died on October 30, 2017 in Boca Raton, Florida. Friendship with Jay Haley Braulio Montalvo, Salvador Minuchin, and Jay Haley One of the developments that came out of Minuchin's work with Jay Haley was the collaborative friendship between the two professionals. Minuchin once wrote of Haley as his most important teacher, a man who was \\"forever pushing the envelope, testing the limits of new ideas\\" to challenge Minuchin and himself.Minuchin, 2007, p.414 Minuchin characterizes their relationship as similar to the friendship between Spock and Captain Kirk from the television show Star Trek in that Jay Haley was highly intellectual, while Minuchin was extremely pragmatic (Minuchin, 2007). Theoretical contributions to family therapy Salvador Minuchin made several important contributions to the field of family therapy during his career, the most important of which was the development of structural family therapy (Nichols, 2010). When Minuchin first began to work as a family therapist, he wrote about enmeshed and disengaged families, which became an important component of structural family therapy. Minuchin also suggested that most families try to solve their problems through first-order changes (changes of single behaviors) and that in order for a family's structure to significantly change and become healthy again, second-order changes (alterations of the family's rules) are necessary. These concepts informed his conception of structural family therapy and influenced other branches of family psychology. Psychosomatic model for treatment of anorexia nervosa In 1978 Minuchin helped write Psychosomatic Families: Anorexia Nervosa in Context, which details a clinical model for the causes and treatment of anorexia nervosa based on an integration of medical research and previously successful psychological interventions (Minuchin, Rosman, & Baker, 1978). The psychosomatic model of anorexia nervosa specifically combines elements of psychodynamic and behavioral theory to create a comprehensive account of the origins of anorexia nervosa in a family system. According to the book, optimal treatment of anorexia nervosa involves the application of behavioral and structural family therapy methods. The book also features four case studies of families whose members have suffered from anorexia nervosa and how the model's treatment was successfully applied to their situation. Criticisms of postmodern therapy In an editorial in The Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, Minuchin (1998) expressed concerns about postmodern family therapy. He argued that both narrative therapy and solution-focused therapy bring unique and useful methods to the practice of family therapy, such as emphasizing alternative personal narratives to cope with problems. However, he stated that postmodern therapies lost the information that family dialogues produced, the spontaneity of therapist- directed enactments, the focus on the therapist as a positive and helpful, that the therapist can make a family feel more connected, and the acknowledgement that the therapist must function with personal bias. In other words, Minuchin felt that postmodern therapy displaced the family and created a paradigm for therapy that was not representative of the psychological experience of a family. In a follow up to his initial criticisms, Minuchin (1999) also stated that he felt the focus of postmodern therapy was too broad to be effectively applied to the specific problems of a family unit. He suggests that family therapy should be used to alleviate stress of pain within a family, not to remove the influence of overarching cultural narratives. Minuchin Center for the Family When Minuchin moved to New York in 1981, he established the Family Studies Institute, where he could teach family therapists and interface directly with the foster care system through consultation services (Nichols, 2010). Renamed the Minuchin Center for the Family after Minuchin's retirement in 1995, it is dedicated to teaching the concepts and techniques of structural family therapy, and to consulting with organizations that work with families challenged by poverty, racism, and discrimination due to gender or sexual orientation.

Biography Pennell was born in Philadelphia, and first studied there, but like his friend, James McNeill Whistler, he then made his home in London, and taught at Slade School of Art. He won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900), and 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. He taught also at the Art Students League of New York. Works Pennell made etchings that depicted landmarks in Philadelphia. His main distinction is as an original etcher and lithographer, and notably as an illustrator. He wrote and illustrated an anti-Semitic travel book, The Jew at Home: Impressions of a Summer and Autumn Spent with Him (D. Appleton: New York, 1892), based on his travels in Europe.Pennell, Joseph, The Jew at Home (NY, 1892), https://archive.org/details/cu31924028574352 He produced other books, many of them in collaboration with his wife, Elizabeth Robins Pennell. In 1886 he published Two Pilgrim's Progress, an illustrated book of his journey with Elizabeth from Florence to Rome, riding a heavy tricycle. The Pennells wrote a biography of Whistler in 1906, and, after some litigation with his executrix on the right to use his letters, the book was published in 1908. In 1912, Pennell traveled to Panama to create lithographs of the Panama Canal, which was still under construction.

It is possible that Pennell's visit inspired San Francisco printmakers Robert Harshe and Pedro Lemos, along with sculptor Ralph Stackpole and painter Gottardo Piazzoni, to found the California Society of Etchers in 1912, now the California Society of Printmakers. That Liberty Shall Not Perish from the Earth (1918), calls up the pictorial image of a bombed New York City, engulfed in a firestorm Pennell designed the poster for the fourth Liberty Loans campaign of 1918. It showed the entrance to New York Harbor under aerial and naval bombardment, with the Statue of Liberty partly destroyed.  Little Wakefield  In 1880 Joseph Pennell created Little Wakefield, an etching of the Little Wakefield estate. The building is a home located on what is now South Campus of La Salle University, and is currently called St. Mutiens hall. This estate was built by Thomas Fisher in 1829 and was occupied by his families for generations; now it is the residence of the Christian Brothers of the University. The etching depicts the house lived in by the second generation of Fishers. During World War I it was used as demonstration center for a local branch of the National League of Women's Service. Little Wakefield was also the location where Thomas R. Fisher ran the first knitting factory in America.

The region was first occupied after the retreat of the ice age around 8000 BC. During the first millennium AD it was occupied by Romans, Angles and Vikings. The name comes from \\"Eborakon\\" () an old Brythonic name which probably derives from \\"Efor\\" or \\"the place of the yew-trees.\\" Many Yorkshire dialect words and aspects of pronunciation derive from old Norse due to the Viking influence in this region. The name \\"Yorkshire\\", first appeared in writing in the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle in 1065. It was originally composed of three sections called Thrydings, subsequently referred to as Ridings. Following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, Yorkshire was subject to the punitive harrying of the North, which caused great hardship. The Harrying was one of the first genocides recorded in English history and was carried out by the French conquerors on the native Anglo-Saxon-Vikings. The area proved to be notable for uprisings and rebellions through to the Tudor period. During the industrial revolution, the West Riding became the second most important manufacturing area in the United Kingdom, while the predominant industries of the East and North Ridings remained fishing and agriculture. In modern times, the Yorkshire economy suffered from a decline in manufacturing which affected its traditional coal, steel, wool and shipping industries. Geographical context The natural sub-regions of Yorkshire Yorkshire was not a homogeneous natural or topographical area and the contrasting conditions and natural resources led to differences in the way that the different areas of the county developed over time. These differences manifested themselves in contrasting economic developments as well as the styles of the vernacular architecture of the various areas. The North York Moors area is even now very different from the South Yorkshire Coalfield area of West Riding and this differs greatly from Holderness. In Yorkshire there is a very close relationship between the major topographical areas and the underlying geology. The Pennine chain of hills in the west is of Carboniferous origin. The central vale is Permo- Triassic. The North York Moors in the north-east of the county are Jurassic in age while the Yorkshire Wolds to the south east are Cretaceous chalk uplands. The region is drained by several rivers. In eastern and central Yorkshire the many rivers empty their waters into the River Ouse which reaches the North Sea via the Humber Estuary. The main rivers of Yorkshire. The most northerly of the rivers in the Ouse system is the Swale, which drains Swaledale before passing through Richmond and meandering across the Vale of Mowbray. Next, draining Wensleydale, is the River Ure, which joins the Swale east of Boroughbridge. The River Nidd rises on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and flows along Nidderdale before reaching the Vale of York. The Ouse is the name given to the river after its confluence with the Ure at Ouse Gill Beck. The River Wharfe, which drains Wharfedale, joins the Ouse upstream of Cawood. The Rivers Aire and Calder are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse and the most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the River Don, which flows northwards to join the main river at Goole. In the far north of the county the River Tees flows eastwards through Teesdale and empties its waters into the North Sea downstream of Middlesbrough. The smaller River Esk flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at Whitby. The River Derwent rises on the North York Moors, flows south then westwards through the Vale of Pickering then turns south again to drain the eastern part of the Vale of York. It empties into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh. To the east of the Yorkshire Wolds the River Hull flows southwards to join the Humber Estuary at Kingston upon Hull. The western Pennines are served by the River Ribble which drains westwards into the Irish Sea close to Lytham St Anne's. Prehistory The Rudston Monolith, almost 26ft high, close to Rudston Parish Church of all Saints This refers to the period up to the arrival of the Romans, c.71 AD in this area.The History and Archaeology of The Yorkshire Wolds The appearance of the terrain differed greatly from that which exists today. During the early part of this period there was a land connection between what is now Germany and eastern England, making it possible for groups of hunters to wander into the area. When the first people arrived the climate would have been sub arctic and the animals that the Paleolithic groups found would have been included the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros and reindeer. Though the cliffs at Creswell Crags in neighbouring North East Derbyshire contain several caves that were occupied during the last ice age, between around 43,000 and 10,000 years ago, evidence of human activity in Yorkshire itself is, so far, restricted to that revolving around a hunter gatherer lifestyle dating from around 8000/7000 BC. In Victoria Cave, Settle, late upper palaeolithic projectile points were found that include the bone head of a harpoon which was dated to within 110 years of 8270 BC. During the 5,000 years following the arrival of the first migrants the climate improved steadily and a richer natural vegetation started to cover the land including birch, hazel, elm, pine and oak trees. By 5000 BC Britain was separated from mainland Europe after rising sea levels had created the southern area of the North Sea. Chapel Cave, near Malham in the northern Pennines, may have been used as a hunting lookout during the Mesolithic period. Trapezoidal microliths used in wooden shafts as arrows were found in the collection of flint when the cave was excavated. Animal bones which were found there included hare, fox, roe deer, badger and a large bird. Fish scales, particularly perch, were also found. Further south, the Marsden area of the Pennines also became a seasonal hunting ground for early humans in the Mesolithic period. There were seasonal hunting encampments on the high ground by 7000 BC. Stone Age tools have been found at Pule Hill, Warcock Hill, Standedge and March Hill. On the North York Moors relics of this early hunting, gathering and fishing community have been found as a widespread scattering of flint tools and the barbed flint flakes used in arrows and spears. The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area of the Vale of Pickering dates back to the Mesolithic period, around 7000 BC The most important remaining settlement of this period is that at Star Carr near Scarborough, where, due to waterlogged conditions, a considerable quantity of organic remains as well as flint tools, have survived. This is Britain's best- known Mesolithic site. The site, on the eastern shores of glacial Lake Pickering, was surrounded by birch trees, some of which had been cleared and used to construct a rough platform of branches and brushwood. Lumps of turf and stones had been thrown on top of this construction to make a village site. The site was probably visited from time to time by about four or five families who were engaged in hunting, fishing and gathering wild plants as well as manufacturing tools and weapons and working skins for clothes. On the southern edge of the Vale of Pickering lies West Heslerton, where recent excavation has revealed continuous habitation since the Late Mesolithic Age, about 5000 BC. This site has revealed a great deal of dwelling and occupation evidence from the Neolithic period to the present day. Around 3000 BC arable farming and the domestication of animals started in the area. Permanent settlements were built by the Neolithic people and their culture involved ceremonial burials of their dead in barrows. The development of farming in the Vale of Pickering during the Neolithic period is evident in the distribution of earth long barrows throughout the area. These early farmers were the first to destroy the forest cover of the North York Moors. Their settlements were concentrated in the fertile parts of the limestone belt and these areas have been continuously farmed ever since. The Neolithic farmers of the moors grew crops, kept animals, made pottery and were highly skilled at making stone implements. They buried their dead in the characteristic long low burial mounds on the moors. The historic landscape of the Great Wold Valley provides an insight into the activities of prehistoric peoples in the Yorkshire Wolds. The valley was an important place of worship in prehistoric times and it houses a number of important scheduled monuments dating back to Neolithic times.Northern Earth Journeys in Living Landscapes Rudston is the centre of a prehistoric landscape and four Neolithic cursus converge on the village area. Argham Dyke, a prehistoric earthwork dating from the Bronze Age, crosses the area near Rudston. There is also evidence of Iron Age occupation as revealed by aerial photographs showing traces of fields, trackways and farms. The Rudston Monolith at over 25 feet (7.6 metres) is the tallest megalith or Standing stone in the United Kingdom. It is situated in the churchyard in the village of Rudston in the East Riding of Yorkshire and is made from moor grit conglomerate, a material that can be found in the Cleveland Hills inland from Whitby. It dates from the Late Neolithic Period. Thornborough Henge The Thornborough Henges is an ancient monument complex that includes three aligned henges that give the site its name. The complex is located near the village of Thornborough, close to the town of Masham in North Yorkshire. The complex includes many large ancient structures including a cursus, henges, burial grounds and settlements. They are thought to have been part of a Neolithic and Bronze Age 'ritual landscape' comparable with Salisbury Plain and date from between 3500 and 2500 BC. This monument complex has been called 'The Stonehenge of the North' and has been described by English Heritage as the most important ancient site between Stonehenge and the Orkney Islands. There is a dearth of evidence of human occupation in the Vale of York until the early Bronze Age around 2300 BC, when the inhabitants of the Yorkshire region began to use implements made of bronze. The metal was refined from ore and hammered or cast to shape. As the Neolithic period gave way to the Bronze Age in the area, people continued to farm, clear forest and use stone tools. They also continued to hunt in the upland areas as finds of their barbed and tanged flint arrowheads show. Only gradually did metal tools and weapons become adopted. The Bronze Age was a time of major changes in burial rituals. The bodies were buried beneath circular mounds of earth which are called round barrows and they are often accompanied by bronze artefacts. The great majority of known barrows are in prominent upland locations such as the Wolds, Moors and Pennine areas of Yorkshire, but some Bronze Age remains have been found on the fringe of the Vale of Pickering and there are a very few in the Vale of York. During the early Bronze Age, barrow burials were performed on the site of Ferrybridge Henge. The Street House Long Barrow at Loftus on the Cleveland coastline between Saltburn and Staithes was a Bronze Age mound that had been erected on top of a much earlier burial monument dating from the Neolithic period. A prehistoric settlement on Harkerside Moor in Swaledale. The Iron Age started around 700 BC in this area. There was a continuation and development of settlement patterns which originated in the Bronze Age. Heavily defended settlements on coastal and inland promontories were established. In East Yorkshire a new burial rite in which the dead were buried within square ditched barrows, and sometimes accompanied by grave goods including carts or chariots, appears from about 500 BC. This is the Arras culture of the Parisii tribe. Before their invasion the Romans identified three different tribes of people living in the Yorkshire area. The area now covered by Yorkshire was mostly the territory of the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe who lived between Tyne and Humber. Another tribe, the Parisii, inhabited what would become the East Riding. The Carvetii occupied an area of what is now called Cumbria, but was at the time of the Domesday Book still part of Yorkshire. Life was centred on agriculture, wheat and barley as the staple foods. The Brigantes lived in small villages, and raised cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses. Fortifications were constructed in Brigantia and notable forts can still be discerned on Ingleborough and at Wincobank, amongst other places. Stanwick seems to have been the tribal capital of the Brigantes up until the Roman conquest. In 2017 the remains of a horse and chariot were found in Pocklington. Roman Roman wall and the west corner tower of the fort at York, with medieval additions Roman Britain refers to those parts of the island of Great Britain controlled by the Roman Empire between 43 and 410 AD. Yorkshire was effectively part of the Roman Empire from 71 AD to about 410 AD. Initially, Roman advances in Britain stopped at the River Don, the southern boundary of the Brigantian territory. The Templeborough area of Rotherham, just south of the Don, takes its name from the remains of the Roman fort found here. This was first built in wood c. 55 AD, and was later rebuilt in stone.Yorkshire history Queen Cartimandua, the last ruler of the Brigantes, depended on Roman support to withstand the forces of her estranged husband, Venutius. The territory remained independent until 69 AD, when the Ninth Legion under Quintus Petillius Cerialis moved in to quell civil war between Cartimandua and Venutius, bringing to an end to British rule in England. A fort at Danum (Doncaster), at a crossing over the River Don was built around 71 AD.A Brief History of Doncaster The Romans advanced along the road that ran along the Wolds from Lindum Colonia (Lincoln) and then crossed the Humber to land at Petuaria, (Brough). This was the capital settlement of the Parisii tribe. The advancing Romans built roads northwards through the northern terrain to Eboracum (York), Derventio (Malton) and Isurium Brigantum (Aldborough) then onwards to Cataractonium (Catterick). Piercebridge in the Tees lowlands is the site of the fortified river crossing where Dere Street crossed the River Tees. York was founded in 71 AD as Eboracum, the Roman capital of Northern Britain and a fort was established there. There were still large areas of ill drained lowlands so the main routeways and settlements were built on higher ground on the Wolds and the edges of Holderness, the Vale of Pickering and the central Vales of Mowbray and York. The site of York and its access routes took advantage of the higher ground of the York moraine which crosses the vale from west to east. Roman Britain Within a few years of defeating the Brigantian tribe at Stanwick in 74 AD the Romans had discovered and were smelting lead at Greenhow, in Nidderdale, in the Pennines as evidenced by inscribed pigs of lead found in the area. Beside the economic benefits of occupying and exploiting the raw materials of this northern region of Britain there were military reasons. The warlike Picts and Scots were kept at bay by stationing the Roman IX Legion in the area and most of the Roman settlements north of the Humber were military stations. The Romans built military settlements in the Pennines at Olicana (Ilkley), Castleshaw and Slack, which were maintained to stop insurrections by the Brigantians, and temporary Roman military camps on the North York Moors at Cawthorne and Goathland. There were, however, clusters of Roman villas around Derventio, Petuaria and in the area around present day Bridlington. A line of signal stations, one of which is located at Castle Hill, Scarborough, was built along the North Yorkshire coast warn of the approach of shipping. In the 2nd century Hadrians Wall was completed from the River Tyne to the shore of the Solway Firth and the military threat lessened so more civilian settlements grew to the south of the wall. In the early 3rd century York was granted the honorary rank of a Roman colony and Isurium Brigantum expanded to become the largest civilian settlement in the area. Around this time York became the Roman military capital of northern Britain, Britannia Inferior, following the province being split. When Britannia was further divided in 296, York remained the administrative centre of Britannia Secunda. Constantine the Great was crowned Roman Emperor here in 306 and it would be he who would institute Roman Christendom. In 402 AD the Roman garrison was recalled from York because of military threats in other parts of the Roman empire. Their most abiding legacy in this area is the road system which they left behind. Many modern main roads in Yorkshire, including parts of the A1, A59, A166 and A1079, still follow the routes of Roman roads. Sub- Roman At the end of Roman rule in the 5th century, Northern Britain may have come under the rule of Romano-British Coel Hen, the last of the Roman-style Duces Brittanniarum (Dukes of the Britons). However, the Romano-British kingdom rapidly broke up into smaller kingdoms and York became the capital of the British kingdom of Ebrauc. Most of what became Yorkshire fell under the rule of the kingdom of Ebrauc but Yorkshire also included territory in the kingdoms of Elmet and an unnamed region ruled by Dunod Fawr, which formed at around this time as did Craven. Depiction of Edwin of Northumbria from Sledmere In the late 5th century and early 6th century Angles from the Schleswig-Holstein peninsula began colonising the Wolds, North Sea and Humber coastal areas. This was followed by the subjugation of the whole of east Yorkshire and the British kingdom of Ebruac in about 560. The name the Angles gave to the territory was Dewyr, or Deira. Early rulers of Deira extended the territory north to the River Wear and about 600, √Üthelfrith was able to unite Deira with the northern kingdom of Bernicia, forming the kingdom of Northumbria, whose capital was at Eoforwic, modern day York. A later ruler, Edwin of Northumbria completed the conquest of the area by his conquest of the kingdom of Elmet, including Hallamshire and Leeds, in 617. He converted to the Christian religion, along with his nobles and many of his subjects, in 627 and was baptised at Eoforwic. His defeat at the Battle of Hatfield Chase by Penda of Mercia in 633 was followed by continuing struggles between Mercia and Northumbria for supremacy over Deira. Edwin's successor, Oswald, was sympathetic to the Celtic church and around 634 he invited Aidan from Iona to found a monastery at Lindisfarne as a base for converting Northumbria to Celtic Christianity. Aidan soon established a monastery on the cliffs above Whitby with Hilda as abbess. Further monastic sites were established at Hackness and Lastingham and Celtic Christianity became more influential in Northumbria than the Roman system. This caused conflict within the church until the issue was resolved at the Synod of Whitby in 663 by Oswiu of Northumbria opting to adopt the Roman system. For the kingdom of Northumbria the Viking era opened in 793 with an attack on the monastery at Lindisfarne. Danish Vikings crossed the North Sea to plunder the coast of Northumbria whilst Norwegians raided Orkney, the Western Isles and Ireland. Yngling King Ragnar Lodbrok led a Danish Leidang into Northumbria during the mid-9th century, but was captured and executed in a snake pit at the Anglian court. The Danes embarked on a mission of vengeance, but were also part of the greater Scandinavian imperialist movement. In 865 his eldest son Ivar the Boneless led younger sons in control of the army into landing at East Anglia, where they slew King Edmund the Martyr. After their landing in East Anglia, the Danes headed north and took York in 866, eventually conquering the whole of Northumbria and Kingdom of Strathclyde. Early Middle Ages A medieval representation of Saint Olaf After the Danish subjugation of the region, in 875 Guthrum became leader of the Danes and he apportioned lands to his followers; however most of the English population were allowed to retain their lands under the lordship of their Scandinavian conquerors. Ivar the Boneless became \\"King of all Scandinavians in the British Isles\\". The Danes changed the Old English name for York from Eoforwic, to Jorvik. The Vikings destroyed all the early monasteries in the area and took the monastic estates for themselves. Some of the minster churches survived the plundering and eventually the Danish leaders were converted to Christianity. In the late 9th century Jorvik was ruled by the Christian king Guthfrith. It was under the Danes that the ridings and wapentakes of Yorkshire and the Five Burghs were established. The ridings were arranged so that their boundaries met at Jorvik, which was the administrative and commercial centre of the region. The Swedish Muns√∂ dynasty became overlords of Jorvik because the Danes in Britain had promised loyalty to the Muns√∂ Kings of Dublin, but this dynasty was focused on the Baltic Sea economy and quarrelled with the native Danish Jelling dynasty (which originated in the Danelaw with Guthrum). The Norse-Gaels, Ostmen or Gallgaidhill became Kings of Jorvik after long contests with the Danes over controlling the Isle of Man, which prompted the Battle of Brunanburh. Then, in 954, King Eric I of Norway of the Fairhair dynasty was slain at the Battle of Stainmore by Anglo-Saxons and Edred of England began overlordship. Jorvik was the direct predecessor to the shire of York and received further Danish royal aids after the invasion and takeover of Jorvik by England, from the Muns√∂ descendants, Sweyn II of Denmark right down to Canute IV of Denmark's martyrdom. Saint Olave's Church in York is a testament to the Norwegian influence in the area. Middle Ages In 1066, after the death of King Edward the Confessor, Yorkshire became the stage for two major battles that would help decide who would succeed to the throne. Harold Godwinson was declared King by the English but this was disputed by Harold Hardrada King of Norway and William Duke of Normandy. In the late summer of 1066 Harold Hardrada, accompanied by Tostig Godwinson, took a large Norwegian fleet and army up the Humber towards York. They were met by the army of the northern earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria who they defeated at the Battle of Fulford. Harold Hardrada occupied York and the Norwegian Army encamped at Stamford Bridge. Harold Godwinson had to travel from London gathering his army as he went to face the invasion. Within five days, on 25 September 1066, Harold Godwinson had reached Stamford Bridge and defeated the Norwegian Army in a battle in which both Harold Hardrada and Tostig Godwinson were killed. The battle at Stamford Bridge can be seen as one of the pivotal battles in English history, it was the last time a Scandinavian army was able to seriously threaten England. On 28 September William Duke of Normandy landed on the south coast of England forcing Harold Godwinson to rush south from Yorkshire with his army. They met at the Battle of Hastings where the English army was defeated and Harold Godwinson killed, allowing William to become King of England. Richmond castle walls and towers seen from the Keep King William I and the Normans did not immediately gain control over the whole of the country, and rebellions in the north of England, including Yorkshire, led to the Harrying of the North. The Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis condemned William the Conqueror for his cruelty in conducting a scorched earth campaign during the winter of 1069‚Äì70. Those who escaped initially hid in Yorkshire's woodland but many (some sources say 100,000) then died of famine or exposure when William salted the ground so nothing would grow. By 1071 the last native-led rebellion against Norman authority in Yorkshire had been suppressed. The severity of the Norman campaign is shown by the fall of land values in Yorkshire by two-thirds between 1069 and 1086. Domesday Book records that 25 continental magnates introduced into Yorkshire by the Conqueror held over 90% of the county's manors. The families who had previously held land were either deprived of their holdings or reduced to subtenants. Scholarship on the \\"harrying\\" does contain some dissent from this history. For instance the use of land value data does not confirm a specific policy of harrying. The difficulty experienced by kings administering the North compared to the South, produces a slanted view of land values and Domesday information. In the early years of Norman rule the new rulers built ringwork castles. These were circular defensive enclosures formed by the construction of a bank and a ditch. Examples of which are Kippax, near Leeds and Castleton on the North York Moors. Yorkshire at this time was frontier country. It was vulnerable to attack from the north by the Scots and from across the North Sea by the Danes. Soon more complex motte and bailey castles were being built as the ruthless and ambitious barons appointed by King William to rule Yorkshire gained a hold on their territories. The parcels of land bestowed by William to his followers in Yorkshire were fewer and much larger than in more southern counties. Each was able to support a sizeable garrison in a strong castle. Large castles were established at Conisbrough, Tickhill, Pontefract, Richmond, Middleham and Skipsea and two in York. At this time also was established the chain of castles across the southern edge of the North York Moors which included Scarborough, Pickering and Helmsley. Fountains abbey from the west When the Normans arrived in Yorkshire there were no monastic foundations. The old Northumbrian clifftop abbey of Whitby lay in ruins. In the centuries following the Conquest splendid abbeys and priories were built in Yorkshire. The first of these was Selby Abbey, founded in 1069 and the birthplace of Henry I of England. There followed the abbeys of St Mary's, York, Rievaulx, Fountains, Whitby, Byland, Jervaulx, Kirkstall, Roche, Meaux and many other smaller establishments. During the succeeding 70 years religious orders flourished, particularly after the promotion of Thurstan of Bayeux to the archbishopric of York in 1114. Between 1114 and 1135 at least 14 were established. The Norman landowners were keen to increase their revenues by establishing new towns and planned villages. Among others, the boroughs of Richmond, Pontefract, Sheffield, Doncaster, Helmsley and Scarborough were established in this way as were the villages of Levisham and Appleton-le-Moors on the North York Moors and Wheldrake in the Vale of York. York was the pre-eminent centre of population before the conquest and was one of only four pre existing towns. The others included Bridlington and Pocklington. The Danish invasions ceased at this time but the Scots continued their invasions throughout the medieval period. The Battle of the Standard was fought against the Scots near Northallerton in 1138. During this period the majority of the Yorkshire population was engaged in small scale farming. A growing number of families were living on the margin of subsistence and some of these families turned to crafts and trade or industrial occupations. By 1300 Yorkshire farmers had reached the present day limits of cultivation on the Pennines. Both lay and monastic landowners exploited the minerals on their estates. There were forges producing iron, and lead was being mined and smelted in the northern dales. In the West Riding there were numerous small coal workings. Until the late 12th century the cloth industry was mostly urban, focussed on York and Beverley. By 1300 the towns of Hedon, Masham, Northallerton, Ripon, Selby, Whitby and Yarm were also involved in cloth manufacture. Around this time the balance of cloth manufacturing was changing in favour of the West Riding rural communities where it was a cottage industry and free of the restrictions of town guilds. Water-powered, belt-driven machinery, Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet, Sheffield. Sheffield, situated amongst a number of fast-flowing rivers and streams surrounded by hills containing raw materials such as coal, iron ore, ganister, and millstone grit for grindstones, made it an ideal place for water-powered industries to develop. Water wheels were often initially built for the milling of corn, but many were converted to the manufacture of blades. As early as the 14th century Sheffield was noted for the production of knives, as noted in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Reeve's Tale from The Canterbury Tales In the early decades of the 14th century Yorkshire suffered from a series of poor harvests, cattle disease and plundering Scottish armies. The Black Death reached Yorkshire in the spring of 1349. The population was reduced drastically by these misfortunes and consequently more land became available for the survivors. The following decades saw the rise of relatively wealthy farming families who founded dynasties of yeomen and minor gentlemen. The large Honours that were created in Yorkshire and the North of England by William I after the Conquest made them attractive for succeeding monarchs to give to their sons to support a royal lifestyle. These honours were, in some cases, combined to form Duchies, the most notable of which were the duchies of York and Lancaster. ;Wars of the Roses When conflict arose between the two Dukes during the Wars of the Roses much of the fighting took place in Yorkshire, where their estates were interlocked and woven together. > The leading families in the East and West Ridings supported the House of > Lancaster overwhelmingly, but in the North Riding loyalty was divided. The > Nevilles of Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, the Scropes of Bolton, the > Latimers of Danby and Snape, and the Mowbrays of Thirsk and Burton in > Lonsdale supported the House of York. The Nevilles‚Äô great rivals, the > Percies, together with the Cliffords of Skipton, Ros of Helmsley, Greystock > of Hinderskelfe, Stafford of Holderness and Talbot of Sheffield fought for > the Lancastrians. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster had senior influence over many people in the North of England and consequently, Yorkshiremen fought under his command in the Hundred Years' War. King Richard III of England in the House of York held early office in the Council of the North, at Middleham Castle where Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales was born. The last vestiges of feudal order remain to-date in the Duchy of Lancaster, founded by the House of Lancaster. Both Yorkshire and Richmondshire had significant connections with Scotland and France through the personal connections of their feudal and titular Peers which may have been connected to the Auld Alliance. One must consider the historically Norse origins of Yorkshire's population, the local ties of Balliol, Bruce and Stewart monarchs of Scotland, including Scottish royal fiefdom of Northumbria at several times. (See Earl of Huntingdon) Early Modern When the Earl of Richmond became King of England in 1485 his dynasty began systematically to destroy or remove local resistance to their rule by confiscating their religious rights and economic livelihood. The Yorkshire rebellion, 1489 occurred during the reign of Henry VII. Parliament wanted money to help defend Brittany, which was allied to England, in the war against France. Henry sent Percy, Earl of Northumberland to collect taxes to help raise some money. However, many of the people in Northumberland and Yorkshire claimed to have already paid their part through local taxes, and were unwilling to give more money to defend a country of no geographical threat to them, as Yorkshire and Northumberland are in Northern England, whereas Brittany is closer to Cornwall and London. Rebellion broke out in April 1489. The Earl met the rebels, but a scuffle broke out and he was killed. The rebels then asked for pardon but were denied it by the king who sent a large army to the north, led by the Earl of Surrey. The Rebel leader, John √° Chambre was hanged for treason, so they found a new leader in Sir John Egremont (an illegitimate member of the Percy family). Unfortunately for the rebels, Egrement proved to be unreliable and so fled to the Court of Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy and a staunch opposer to Henry's rule. The results of this rebellion were that Henry was unable to get enough money to defend Brittany and he became aware of the lawless nature of the North of England. The Humble Petition of The Gentry and Commons of the County of York, presented to His Majestie at York, 22 April 1642 : and His Majesties message sent to the Parliament, 24 April 1642 : concerning Sir John Hothams Refusall to give His Majestie entrance into Hull. Printed at London, 1642 Between 1536 and 1540, the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII of England had a profound and permanent effect on the Yorkshire landscape. Thousands of acres of monastic property was divided and sold to form the estates of the gentry and the newly rich industrial entrepreneurs. This happened right across the county from Guisborough Priory in the north through to Rievaulx Abbey on the North York Moors, Jervaulx Abbey and Fountains Abbey in the dales and Roche Abbey in the south. In all 120 religious institutions were closed in Yorkshire. The unpopularity of the Tudor royals resonated in the Pilgrimage of Grace and Rising of the North. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth Yorkshire saw a steady rise in population. New industries created employment and wealth, and improved farming methods and imports of corn stopped food shortages. The steady rise in population created pressure to enclose common land for agriculture and the farming communities turned increasingly to cottage industries to make a living. The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 had Yorkshire associations, Guy Fawkes was born in York where he was educated at St Peters School. Nevertheless, a government inquiry of 1605-6 revealed that the plot lacked significant support in the county. The economy and character of many West Riding settlements became markedly different from the other areas of the county in the 17th century. Farmers combined mining, metal working, weaving, tanning and other crafts with agriculture in these towns which were not subject to the restrictive practices of guilds.By 1600 Sheffield was the main centre of cutlery production in England, and in 1624 The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire was formed to oversee the trade. In Leeds in 1629 manufacturers were employing men full-time as clothiers. Helmsley Castle was destroyed at the end of the Civil War Many local families were Cavaliers in the English Civil War and some fled to American colonies during the usurping Commonwealth of England or The Protectorate. Most were either neutral, divided or changed sides. At an early stage in the conflict King Charles attempted to establish a garrison at Kingston upon Hull but was denied entry. After some initial successes the Parliamentary forces were defeated across most of Yorkshire but they staged a comeback and in 1644 at the Battle of Marston Moor Oliver Cromwell's cavalry routed Prince Rupert's forces and during the next few months the remaining royalist garrisons in the north fell. At the end of the war many of the old castles of Yorkshire such as Helmsley and Pontefract were dismantled so that they could never again be fortified. King James II of England was owner of colonial New York as the Duke of York, as well as governor of the Hudson's Bay Company and Royal African Company. Some locals were closet Recusants, Tory or Jacobite in political orientation, not happy being used against their Scottish neighbours. National government conceded to their sensitivities by appointing a Council of the North and a Secretary of State for the Northern Department, but these were abolished upon the government suspecting its link with independent Northern influence on national affairs, especially in connection to the American War of Independence. Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond was Governor General of British North America, after his father had pioneered the peace settlement with the Americans and pressed for a \\"Union of Hearts\\" with the Irish. Irish Catholics dispossessed of their lands and experiencing discrimination at home, found a warm welcome from Yorkshiremen in the cities of the West Riding. Modern The 19th Century interior of Marshall's flax mill, Holbeck, Leeds The 19th century was a time of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in Yorkshire. Yorkshire was already a centre of industry in textiles, concentrated in the West Riding. Steel continued to be concentrated around Sheffield, as was the production of coal. The worsted sector of the textile industry was the first to adapt the machinery developed by the Lancashire cotton industry and had become completely factory based by the 1860s including large horizontally integrated mills. Steel production at this time involved long working hours, in unpleasant conditions that offered little or no safety protection. Friedrich Engels in his The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 described the conditions prevalent in Sheffield at that time. The city became one of the main centres for trade union organisation and agitation in the UK. By the 1860s, the growing conflict between capital and labour provoked the so-called 'Sheffield Outrages', which culminated in a series of explosions and murders carried out by union militants. The Sheffield Trades Council organised a meeting in Sheffield in 1866 at which the United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades ‚Äî a forerunner of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) ‚Äî was founded. William Wilberforce, Member of Parliament for Hull, was a prominent abolitionist in the slave trade. The Edwardian period in Yorkshire brought the Labour Party (UK) into focus, as it tried to mobilise further reform. Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell commanded the Northern Territorial Army at Richmond Castle until 1910. Changes in 1974 Local government in England was reformed in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972.Elcock, H, Local Government, (1994) Under the act, the ridings lost their lieutenancies and shrievalties and the administrative counties, county boroughs and their councils were abolished. The area of Yorkshire was divided between a number of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties:Redcliffe-Maud & Wood, B., English Local Government Reformed, (1974) Some areas of the historic county were transferred to other counties: *Sedbergh, Dent and the rest of the Sedbergh Rural District was transferred from the West Riding to Cumbria *Slaidburn and the rest of Bowland Rural District was transferred from the West Riding to Lancashire *Barnoldswick and other places in West Craven were transferred from the West Riding to Lancashire *Saddleworth was transferred from the West Riding to Greater Manchester *Bowes and the rest of Startforth Rural District was transferred from the North Riding to County Durham *Middlesbrough, Redcar and nearby areas were transferred from the North Riding to Cleveland. The area was returned to Yorkshire in 1996 as part of the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire. *most of the East Riding was transferred to Humberside. The area became the larger part of the new ceremonial county of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1996. *Goole and Goole Rural District was transferred from the West Riding to Humberside. The area became part of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1996. The remaining areas of the East Riding and the North Riding, the city of York and northern and eastern areas of the West Riding became North Yorkshire. The remaining areas of the West Riding became the metropolitan counties of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.  Local government  The history of local government in Yorkshire is both unique and complex, largely due to its size, being the largest historic English county.Vision of Britain - Yorkshire ancient county (historic map) After an extended period of little change, it was subject to a number of significant reforms of local government structures in the 20th century, some of which were controversial.HMSO, Aspects of Britain: Local Government, (1996) The most significant of these was the Local Government Act 1972Arnold-Baker, C., Local Government Act 1972, (1973) and the 1990s UK local government reform. It currently corresponds to several counties and districts and is mostly contained within the Yorkshire and the Humber region.

He was the first Executive Minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo. He is the father of Era√±o G. Manalo, who succeeded him as Executive Minister of the INC, and the grandfather of Eduardo V. Manalo, the current Executive Minister. Because there were no precursors to the registered church, external sources and critics of the INC refer to him as its founder. The official doctrine of the Iglesia ni Cristo professes that Felix M. Ysagun is the last messenger of God, sent to reestablish the church founded by Jesus Christ, which had fallen into apostasy following the end of the Apostolic Age.. Biography F√©lix Manalo y Ysagun (Popularly known as \\"F√©lix Manalo\\") was born in Barrio Calzada, Tipas, Taguig, Manila province (transferred to Rizal province in 1901 and now part of Metro Manila), Philippines, on May 10, 1886. He was raised in a rural setting by his devout Catholic parents, Mariano Ysagun and Bonifacia Manalo. With their livelihood based on a combination of agricultural work, shrimp catching and mat making, they were humble people who lived on the edge of poverty. During a childhood disrupted by his father's death, his mother's remarriage and the Philippine Revolution, and an adolescence overshadowed by the Filipino-American War, Manalo received only a few years of formal schooling.It was sometime after his mother‚Äôs death that he decided on his mother‚Äôs name over his father‚Äôs name Late in the 1890s, after a telling lapse of faith, the teenage Manalo rejected Catholicism. At the time he resided in Manila with his uncle Father Mariano Borja, a priest assigned to the urban parish of Sampaloc. Severely rebuked for privately studying the Bible, Manalo began forthwith to question many basic Catholic doctrines. He also sought solace in other religious groups. According to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, the establishment of the Philippine Independent Church or the Aglipayan Church was his major turning point, but Manalo remained uninterested since its doctrines were mainly Catholic. In 1904, he joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, entered the Methodist seminary, and became a pastor for a while. He also sought through various denominations, including the Presbyterian Church, Christian Mission, and finally Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1911. There Manalo laboured as trusted evangelist before quarrelling with Adventist leaders over matters of doctrine and customary authority relationships between Westerners and Filipinos. He was disfellowshipped from the SDA faith in 1913. Plainly displeased with the various branches of Christianity brought to the Philippines by foreign missionaries, Manalo began to mingle with a diverse crowd of atheists and freethinkers who had rejected organized religion. Establishment of the Iglesia ni Cristo Iglesia ni Cristo's first congregation in Punta, Santa Ana, Manila. The chapel is now a museum owned by the Iglesia. On November 1913, Manalo secluded himself with religious literature and unused notebooks in a friend's house in Pasay, instructing everyone in the house not to disturb him. He emerged from his silence three days later with his newfound doctrines and principles. Brother Manalo, together with his wife, Honorata, went to Punta that same month and began preaching. He also returned to Taguig to evangelize and preach; there, he was ridiculed and questioned by the townsfolk during his meetings. He was later able to baptize a few converts, including some of his persecutors. He registered his newfound religion as the Iglesia ni Cristo (English: Church of Christ; Spanish: Iglesia de Cristo) on July 27, 1914, at the start of the First World War, at the Bureau of Commerce as a unipersonal corporation with himself as the first Executive Minister. Expansion followed as the Iglesia started building congregations in the provinces as early as 1916. The denomination's first three ministers were ordained in 1919. By 1924, the INC had about 3,000 to 5,000 adherents in 43 or 45 congregations in Manila and six nearby provinces. By 1936, the INC had 85,000 members. This figure grew to 200,000 by 1954. A Cebu congregation was built in 1937‚Äîthe first to be established outside of Luzon, and the first in the Visayas. The first mission to Mindanao was in 1946. Meanwhile, the INC's first concrete chapel was built in Sampaloc, Manila, in 1948. Adherents fleeing Manila, where the Japanese forces were concentrated during the Second World War, were used for evangelization. As Manalo's health began to fail in the 1950s, his son Era√±o started to take leadership of the church. In November 30, 1955, Felix led the dedication of the chapel of the Locale of Pasay, simultaneously with the offering of Brother Era√±o's newborn son Brother Eduardo V. Manalo, the current Executive Minister. Death Birthplace of F√©lix Manalo as a National Historical Landmark FYM historical marker On April 2, 1963, Manalo was confined to hospital for treatment of peptic ulcer disease, which brought him constant pain that medication did not help. On April 11, 1963, doctors performed a third surgery on him, which would be his last.May‚ÄìJune 1986 issue of Pasugo magazine Manalo died on April 12, 1963, at 2:35 in the morning, at the age of 76, prayers did not save him. Leadership of the Iglesia passed to his son, Era√±o, who was chosen unanimously by the district ministers in 1953.Palafox, First Executive Minister, NHI His remains were viewed by mourners in the INC's 3,200-seater chapel in San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City. On April 23, he was buried at what was then the central office of the Iglesia ni Cristo in San Juan, Rizal. The local police estimated the crowd at the funeral procession to have been 2 million, and the rite took five hours. F√©lix Manalo started his preaching with only a handful of listeners in a small room at the workers' quarters of a construction company named Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Steamship Company. When he died, he left a well-established church with millions of members all over the Philippines. In 49 years of existence, the Iglesia ni Cristo had 1,250 local chapels and 35 large concrete cathedrals. F√©lix Manalo was a recognized person.

These works would have given the presentation of Iglesia doctrine and hermeneutics greater depth. Recognition The church's growth and expansion met many criticisms and persecutions. Its leaders and members alike were often ridiculed and maligned. However, Felix Manalo was an eloquent speaker, and he could deliver a skillful argument and had a facility in the use of Scriptures and a mastery in organization. The ministers of the Christian Mission honored him on December 25, 1918, as an outstanding evangelist. The Genius Divinical College of Manila on Avenida, Rizal, a non-sectarian institution headed by Eugenio Guerero, conferred on Felix Manalo the degree of Master of Biblo- Science honoris causa on March 28, 1931.

The marker is located at Barangay Calzada, Tipas, Taguig City, Metro Manila where the ancestral home of Manalo once stood. The marker sits on a 744-square-meter plaza. In his dedication speech, Ludovico Badoy, NHI executive director, said, \\"Brother Felix Manalo's significant contribution to Philippine Society is worth recognizing and emulating.\\" He further said, \\"... the church he preached [has] changed the lives and faith of many Filipinos. He deserves the pride and recognition of the people of Taguig.\\" The responsibility, maintenance, and operation of the landmark was turned over to the INC.Cantor, Pasugo God's Message, August 2007, pg 12) On the same year, the Philippine government declared July 27 of every year as \\"Iglesia ni Cristo Day\\" to enable millions of INC followers in the Philippines and in 75 countries around the world to observe the occasion with fitting solemnity.Suarez, Officials celebrate ..., The Manila Bulletin Online, July 27, 2008 On May 10, 2014, coinciding his 128th birth anniversary, the Philippine Postal Corp.

The stamp features the INC Central Temple and Felix Manalo in sepia. At the bottom of the stamp is the INC centennial logo in color. Philpost issued 1.2 million of the stamps, which is more than twice the number of stamps they usually issue for a single design.

There is evidence however that after John met his future wife, he became complicit in his mother's scheming to have him removed from frontline duties and thus he spent the rest of life ashamed and his final years locked away trying to erase his past.\\" Later life and family Haddon Hall On 27 January 1916, he married Kathleen Tennant (1895‚Äì1989), whom he knew from his mother's circle \\"The Souls.\\" She was the granddaughter of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet.

Interests Despite the exaggeration of his military service, Rutland was well respected in other areas and by his peers. Art historian Tancred Borenius eulogized Rutland in The Times thus: > \\"The distinction of the Duke of Rutland as an authority on medieval art is > rightly stressed in the obituary which appeared in The Times, and it should > perhaps be further emphasized, that in one department of the study of > English Medieval Art he was a pioneer whose performance, calling for immense > labour and patience, has laid the foundations for all future research on the > subject.

Life and works Haley was born at his family's homestead in Midwest, Wyoming. His family moved to Berkeley, California, when he was four years old. After serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, he attended UCLA where he received a BA in Theater Arts. During his undergraduate years, Haley published a short story in The New Yorker.Haley, J. (1947, July 5). The Eastern question. The New Yorker, p. 53. After a year spent in pursuit of a career as a playwright, he returned to California and received a Bachelor of Library Science degree from University of California at Berkeley and then a master's degree in communication from Stanford University. He was married for the first time in 1950 and had three children, Kathleen, Gregory, and Andrew, with his wife Elizabeth. While at Stanford, Haley met the anthropologist Gregory Bateson who invited him to join a communications research project that later became known as The Bateson Project, a collaboration that became one of the driving factors in the creation of family therapy and that published the single most important paper in the history of family therapy,Keim, J., & Lappin, J. (2002). Structural-strategic marital therapy. In A. S. Gurman & N. S. Jacobson (Eds.), Clinical Handbook of Couple Therapy (3rd Ed.) (pp. 86-117, here p. 88). New York: Guilford. \\"Towards a Theory of Schizophrenia.\\"Bateson, G., Jackson, D., Haley, J., & Weakland, J. (1956). Toward a theory of schizophrenia. Behavioral Science, 1(4), 251-264. The central members of this project were Gregory Bateson, Donald deAvila Jackson, Jay Haley, John Weakland, and Bill Fry. In addition to his personal involvement in the birth and evolution of family therapy, Haley was an observational researcher of psychotherapy in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Bateson Project arranged for Jay and John Weakland to observe and record clinicians including Milton Erickson, Joseph Wolpe, John Rosen, Don Jackson, Charles Fulweiler, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, and others. In 1962, while working at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, Haley became the founding editor of the family therapy journal Family Process (assisted by his first wife, Elizabeth Haley, an experienced journalist). While at MRI, Jay continued the professional relationship with Milton Erickson that had been established in the earliest years of the Bateson Project. Jay helped to introduce Erickson to the clinical public with such important books as Uncommon Therapy. Haley also worked closely with Salvador Minuchin, who developed Structural Family Therapy. Haley moved to Philadelphia in the mid-1960s to take a position at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic. Through his collaboration with Salvador Minuchin and Braulio Montalvo, he influenced (and was influenced by) the evolution of Structural Family Therapy in the early 1970s. Braulio Montalvo, Salvador Minuchin, and Jay Haley After founding the Family Therapy Institute of Washington, DC, with second wife Cloe Madanes in 1976, Haley continued to be a central force in the evolution of Strategic Family Therapy. His publications from the years at the Family Therapy Institute include one of the field's most influential best selling books, Problem Solving Therapy. After leaving the Family Therapy Institute in the 1990s, Haley moved to the San Diego area and, in collaboration with his third wife Madeleine Richeport-Haley, produced a number of films relating to both anthropology and psychotherapy. Madeleine also collaborated in the writing of his final book, Directive Family Therapy. At the time of his death, he was also a Scholar In Residence at California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University. Haley combined a systemic understanding of human problems and strengths with a pragmatic approach to intervention. His method of therapy ‚Äî he claimed not to have a theory of therapy ‚Äî emphasizes creative and sometimes provocative instructions to which clients react. The approach emphasizes careful contracting between clients and the therapist, experimenting with possible solutions (in a manner sometimes inspired by the therapist and sometimes inspired by the client), review of the results and informed resumption of experimentation until the goal of therapy is achieved. In the 1960s and 1970s when psychodynamic approaches to therapy dominated, such practicality was commonly seen as heretical. The here-and-now emphasis of Haley and others of his generation of pragmatic practitioners is now the norm for the field of psychotherapy. Haley's Strategic Therapy Strategic Therapy is any type of therapy where the therapist initiates what happens during therapy and designs a particular approach for each problem. As Haley wrote in Uncommon Therapy: The Psychiatric Techniques Of Milton H. Erickson MD: \\"Strategic therapy isn't a particular approach or theory, but a name for the types of therapy where the therapist takes responsibility for directly influencing people\\" (p. 17). Strategic family therapists may sometimes explore understanding ways in which a patient's symptoms might be viewed as benevolent attempts to deal with other family issues. This a variation of Don Jackson's view of symptoms as \\"love gone wrong.\\" Haley's strategic therapy focuses on short-term, targeted efforts to solve a specific problem. A therapist employing strategic therapy must: * Identify solvable problems. * Set goals. * Design interventions to achieve those goals. * Examine the responses. * Examine the outcome of the therapy.

Life Thomas was born at Canonbury, London and was educated at Dulwich College.Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, pages 52, (Heinemann: London) His father, a Welshman, was in the civil service, and his mother was the daughter of the Rev. James Gilchrist. His father's death left his family with a considerably reduced income, he gave up his original idea of becoming a doctor and obtained an appointment as a police court clerk, in which he kept until May 1879. During these twelve years, besides the work of a busy police court, which brought him into intimate contact with social problems, he found time to study chemistry, and attended lectures at the Birkbeck Institute (which later became Birkbeck College). George Chaloner, the chemistry teacher at the Institute remarked one evening that \\"the man who eliminates phosphorus by means of the Bessemer converter will make his fortune.\\" This caught the attention of Thomas, and he set himself the task of solving the problem of eliminating phosphorus from iron produced by Bessemer converters. By the end of 1875 was convinced that he had discovered a method. He communicated his theory to his cousin, Percy Gilchrist, who was a chemist at the former Blaenavon Ironworks, Blaenavon in Wales, and experiments were made which proved satisfactory. Edward Martin, manager of the Blaenavon Works, gave facilities for conducting the experiments on a larger scale and undertook to help in taking out a patent. In March 1878, the first public announcement of the discovery was made at the meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute and took out a patent in May,Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist at Welsh Biography Online but without attracting much attention. In September a paper was written by Thomas and Gilchrist on the \\"Elimination of Phosphorus in the Bessemer Converter\\" for the autumn meeting of this institute, but was not read until May 1879. Thomas, however, made the acquaintance of Edward Windsor Richards, the manager of Bolckow Vaughan & Co's works at Cleveland, Yorkshire, whom he interested in the process, and from this time the success of the invention was assured and domestic and foreign patents were taken out. The \\"basic process\\" invented by Thomas was especially valuable on the continent of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron is much larger than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany the name of the inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In the United States, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, immense interest was taken in the invention. The improved process resulted in much more slag forming in the converter. Thomas discovered that this \\"basic slag\\" could be useful and profitable as a phosphate fertiliser, known as Thomas meal. In 1883, jointly with George James Snelus, who had previously discovered the process but had failed to develop it, he was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal of the Iron and Steel Institute for their work on dephosphorization. Thomas had been overworking for years, and his lungs became affected. A long sea voyage and a residence in Egypt proved unavailing to restore his health and he died in Paris in 1885 and was buried at Passy. Legacy He had what William Ewart Gladstone, in a review of the Memoirs published in 1891, described as an \\"enthusiasm of humanity,\\" and he left his fortune to be used for the promotion of philanthropic work. A police court mission was endowed in his memory. In July 1960 an obelisk, dedicated to his memory, was erected in South Wales, UK, by the Newport and District Metallurgical Society in conjunction with the Iron and Steel Institute. Financial contributions came from many sources and reflected acknowledgment of his work from the United Kingdom and other countries. The former American Society for Metals, in 1985, struck a commemorative plaque in recognition of the historical importance of the ironworks and honouring his work there. The obelisk and plaque may be seen at the ironworks.

He also ran dog teams in a professional capacity as part of a search and rescue unit in World War II, in sporting events like the Olympics and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and in three Presidential Inauguration ceremonies.  Antarctica and World War II  Vaughan was born on December 18, 1905, in Salem, Massachusetts, as the son of a wealthy leather tanner and shoe manufacturer. In his youth, he became fascinated by tales of early-century polar explorers. He dropped out of Harvard in 1928 when he heard that Admiral Richard E. Byrd was organizing an expedition to Antarctica. Admiral Byrd accepted him on the 1928-1930 expedition, eventually naming a mountain on the continent in his honor. Vaughan appeared in the documentary film With Byrd at the South Pole (1930). In 1994, at the age of 88, Vaughan participated in an expedition to climb the 10,302 ft (3,150 m) Mount Vaughan. His plans to return in December 2005, to celebrate his 100th birthday, were scrapped in August due to lack of funds. A highlight of his publicity push was his appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on May 10, 2005, and a full-page article in the Los Angeles Times. He made plans to return in 2006 but these were halted by his death just six months before the scheduled date. In 1932, he competed in the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, in the sprint mushing demonstration sport. During World War II, Vaughan was employed by U.S. Army Air Forces Search and Rescue as a dogsled driver, attaining the rank of colonel and engaging in many rescue missions in Greenland. He was also a veteran of the Korean War. Alaska enthusiast Vaughan moved to Alaska at the age of 68. Bankrupt and divorced, he rebuilt his life, competing in 13 Iditarod races and \\"crashing\\" the Presidential Inauguration parade in 1977, bringing sled dogs to represent his adopted state. In 1981 and 1985, he and his Alaskan contingent formally participated in the parade. He also had a mountain named after him in the Antarctic. In 1997, he organized the annual Norman Vaughan Serum Run to commemorate the 1925 serum run to Nome, which saved the town from a diphtheria epidemic. He is survived by his fourth wife, the former Carolyn Muegge, who has also raced in the Iditarod, and a son and daughter from his earlier marriages. On the celebration of his 100th birthday on December 18, 2005, surrounded by over 100 friends and family, he had champagne, his first drink of liquor in his life, after promising his mother he wouldn't drink until he was 100. Five days later he died in the Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage at around 10:30 AM on December 23, 2005. His wife and some close friends were with him. References * Hardt, Ty.

It is a kind of uncontrolled positive feedback. In other words, \\"thermal runaway\\" describes a process which is accelerated by increased temperature, in turn releasing energy that further increases temperature. In chemistry (and chemical engineering), it is associated with strongly exothermic reactions that are accelerated by temperature rise. In electrical engineering, thermal runaway is typically associated with increased current flow and power dissipation, although exothermic chemical reactions can be of concern here too. Thermal runaway can occur in civil engineering, notably when the heat released by large amounts of curing concrete is not controlled. In astrophysics, runaway nuclear fusion reactions in stars can lead to nova and several types of supernova explosions, and also occur as a less dramatic event in the normal evolution of solar mass stars, the \\"helium flash\\". Some climate researchers have postulated that a global average temperature increase of 3‚Äì4 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial baseline could lead to a further unchecked increase in surface temperatures. For example, releases of methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than CO2, from wetlands, melting permafrost and continental margin seabed clathrate deposits could be subject to positive feedback. , pp. 163‚Äì201. Report website IMPACTS: On the Threshold of Abrupt Climate Changes, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory News Center, 17 September 2008 Chemical engineering Thermal runaway is also called thermal explosion in chemical engineering, or runaway reaction in organic chemistry. It is a process by which an exothermic reaction goes out of control: the reaction rate increases due to an increase in temperature, causing a further increase in temperature and hence a further rapid increase in the reaction rate. This has contributed to industrial chemical accidents, most notably the 1947 Texas City disaster from overheated ammonium nitrate in a ship's hold, and the 1976 explosion of zoalene, in a drier, at King's Lynn. Frank- Kamenetskii theory provides a simplified analytical model for thermal explosion. Chain branching is an additional positive feedback mechanism which may also cause temperature to skyrocket because of rapidly increasing reaction rate. Chemical reactions are either endothermic or exothermic, as expressed by their change in enthalpy. Many reactions are highly exothermic, so many industrial-scale and oil refinery processes have some level of risk of thermal runaway. These include hydrocracking, hydrogenation, alkylation (SN2), oxidation, metalation and nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For example, oxidation of cyclohexane into cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone and ortho-xylene into phthalic anhydride have led to catastrophic explosions when reaction control failed. Thermal runaway may result from unwanted exothermic side reaction(s) that begin at higher temperatures, following an initial accidental overheating of the reaction mixture. This scenario was behind the Seveso disaster, where thermal runaway heated a reaction to temperatures such that in addition to the intended 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, poisonous 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was also produced, and was vented into the environment after the reactor's rupture disk burst. Thermal runaway is most often caused by failure of the reactor vessel's cooling system. Failure of the mixer can result in localized heating, which initiates thermal runaway. Similarly, in flow reactors, localized insufficient mixing causes hotspots to form, wherein thermal runaway conditions occur, which causes violent blowouts of reactor contents and catalysts. Incorrect equipment component installation is also a common cause. Many chemical production facilities are designed with high-volume emergency venting, a measure to limit the extent of injury and property damage when such accidents occur. At large scale, it is unsafe to \\"charge all reagents and mix\\", as is done in laboratory scale. This is because the amount of reaction scales with the cube of the size of the vessel (V ‚àù r¬≥), but the heat transfer area scales with the square of the size (A ‚àù r¬≤), so that the heat production-to-area ratio scales with the size (V/A ‚àù r). Consequently, reactions that easily cool fast enough in the laboratory can dangerously self-heat at ton scale. In 2007, this kind of erroneous procedure caused an explosion of a -reactor used to metalate methylcyclopentadiene with metallic sodium, causing the loss of four lives and parts of the reactor being flung away. Thus, industrial scale reactions prone to thermal runaway are preferably controlled by the addition of one reagent at a rate corresponding to the available cooling capacity. Some laboratory reactions must be run under extreme cooling, because they are very prone to hazardous thermal runaway. For example, in Swern oxidation, the formation of sulfonium chloride must be performed in a cooled system (‚Äì30 ¬∞C), because at room temperature the reaction undergoes explosive thermal runaway. Microwave heating Microwaves are used for heating of various materials in cooking and various industrial processes. The rate of heating of the material depends on the energy absorption, which depends on the dielectric constant of the material. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature varies for different materials; some materials display significant increase with increasing temperature. This behavior, when the material gets exposed to microwaves, leads to selective local overheating, as the warmer areas are better able to accept further energy than the colder areas‚Äîpotentially dangerous especially for thermal insulators, where the heat exchange between the hot spots and the rest of the material is slow. These materials are called thermal runaway materials. This phenomenon occurs in some ceramics. Electrical engineering Some electronic components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power dissipation may raise the temperature further by Joule heating. A vicious circle or positive feedback effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal fuses, circuit breakers, or PTC current limiters. To handle larger currents, circuit designers may connect multiple lower-capacity devices (e.g. transistors, diodes, or MOVs) in parallel. This technique can work well, but is susceptible to a phenomenon called current hogging, in which the current is not shared equally across all devices. Typically, one device may have a slightly lower resistance, and thus draws more current, heating it more than its sibling devices, causing its resistance to drop further. The electrical load ends up funneling into a single device, which then rapidly fails. Thus, an array of devices may end up no more robust than its weakest component. The current- hogging effect can be reduced by carefully matching the characteristics of each paralleled device, or by using other design techniques to balance the electrical load. However, maintaining load balance under extreme conditions may not be straightforward. Devices with an intrinsic positive temperature coefficient (PTC) of electrical resistance are less prone to current hogging, but thermal runaway can still occur because of poor heat sinking or other problems. Many electronic circuits contain special provisions to prevent thermal runaway. This is most often seen in transistor biasing arrangements for high-power output stages. However, when equipment is used above its designed ambient temperature, thermal runaway can still occur in some cases. This occasionally causes equipment failures in hot environments, or when air cooling vents are blocked. =Semiconductors= Silicon shows a peculiar profile, in that its electrical resistance increases with temperature up to about 160 ¬∞C, then starts decreasing, and drops further when the melting point is reached. This can lead to thermal runaway phenomena within internal regions of the semiconductor junction; the resistance decreases in the regions which become heated above this threshold, allowing more current to flow through the overheated regions, in turn causing yet more heating in comparison with the surrounding regions, which leads to further temperature increase and resistance decrease. This leads to the phenomenon of current crowding and formation of current filaments (similar to current hogging, but within a single device), and is one of the underlying causes of many semiconductor junction failures. =Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)= Leakage current increases significantly in bipolar transistors (especially germanium-based bipolar transistors) as they increase in temperature. Depending on the design of the circuit, this increase in leakage current can increase the current flowing through a transistor and thus the power dissipation, causing a further increase in collector-to-emitter leakage current. This is frequently seen in a push-pull stage of a class AB amplifier. If the pull-up and pull-down transistors are biased to have minimal crossover distortion at room temperature, and the biasing is not temperature-compensated, then as the temperature rises both transistors will be increasingly biased on, causing current and power to further increase, and eventually destroying one or both devices. One rule of thumb to avoid thermal runaway is to keep the operating point of a BJT so that Vce ‚â§ 1/2Vcc Another practice is to mount a thermal feedback sensing transistor or other device on the heat sink, to control the crossover bias voltage. As the output transistors heat up, so does the thermal feedback transistor. This in turn causes the thermal feedback transistor to turn on at a slightly lower voltage, reducing the crossover bias voltage, and so reducing the heat dissipated by the output transistors. If multiple BJT transistors are connected in parallel (which is typical in high current applications), a current hogging problem can occur. Special measures must be taken to control this characteristic vulnerability of BJTs. In power transistors (which effectively consist of many small transistors in parallel), current hogging can occur between different parts of the transistor itself, with one part of the transistor becoming more hot than the others. This is called second breakdown, and can result in destruction of the transistor even when the average junction temperature seems to be at a safe level. =Power MOSFETs= Power MOSFETs typically increase their on-resistance with temperature. Under some circumstances, power dissipated in this resistance causes more heating of the junction, which further increases the junction temperature, in a positive feedback loop. As a consequence, power MOSFETs have stable and unstable regions of operation. However, the increase of on- resistance with temperature helps balance current across multiple MOSFETs connected in parallel, so current hogging does not occur. If a MOSFET transistor produces more heat than the heatsink can dissipate, then thermal runaway can still destroy the transistors. This problem can be alleviated to a degree by lowering the thermal resistance between the transistor die and the heatsink. See also Thermal Design Power. =Metal oxide varistors (MOVs)= Metal oxide varistors typically develop lower resistance as they heat up. If connected directly across an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against electrical transients), a MOV which has developed a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire. To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device. =Tantalum capacitors= Tantalum capacitors are, under some conditions, prone to self-destruction by thermal runaway. The capacitor typically consists of a sintered tantalum sponge acting as the anode, a manganese dioxide cathode, and a dielectric layer of tantalum pentoxide created on the tantalum sponge surface by anodizing. It may happen that the tantalum oxide layer has weak spots that undergo dielectric breakdown during a voltage spike. The tantalum sponge then comes into direct contact with the manganese dioxide, and increased leakage current causes localized heating; usually, this drives an endothermic chemical reaction that produces manganese(III) oxide and regenerates (self-heals) the tantalum oxide dielectric layer. However, if the energy dissipated at the failure point is high enough, a self-sustaining exothermic reaction can start, similar to the thermite reaction, with metallic tantalum as fuel and manganese dioxide as oxidizer. This undesirable reaction will destroy the capacitor, producing smoke and possibly flame. Therefore, tantalum capacitors can be freely deployed in small-signal circuits, but application in high-power circuits must be carefully designed to avoid thermal runaway failures. =Digital logic= The leakage current of logic switching transistors increases with temperature. In rare instances, this may lead to thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up a small portion of overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest ‚Äî for an Athlon 64, the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius. For a device with a TDP of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a thermal resistivity of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances.) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects. =Batteries= When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Sealed cells will sometimes explode violently if safety vents are overwhelmed or nonfunctional. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries, most markedly in the form of the lithium polymer battery. Reports of exploding cellphones occasionally appear in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has established regulations regarding the carrying of certain types of batteries on airplanes because of their instability in certain situations. This action was partially inspired by a cargo bay fire on a UPS airplane. One of the possible solutions is in using safer and less reactive anode (lithium titanates) and cathode (lithium iron phosphate) materials ‚Äî thereby avoiding the cobalt electrodes in many lithium rechargeable cells ‚Äî together with non-flammable electrolytes based on ionic liquids. Astrophysics Runaway thermonuclear reactions can occur in stars when nuclear fusion is ignited in conditions under which the pressure exerted by overlying layers of the star greatly exceeds thermal pressure, a situation that makes possible rapid increases in temperature. Such a scenario may arise in stars containing degenerate matter, in which electron degeneracy pressure rather than normal thermal pressure does most of the work of supporting the star against gravity, and in stars undergoing implosion. In all cases, the imbalance arises prior to fusion ignition; otherwise, the fusion reactions would be naturally regulated to counteract temperature changes and stabilize the star. When thermal pressure is in equilibrium with overlying pressure, a star will respond to the increase in temperature and thermal pressure due to initiation of a new exothermic reaction by expanding and cooling. A runaway reaction is only possible when this response is inhibited. =Helium flashes in red giant stars= When stars in the 0.8‚Äì2.0 solar mass range exhaust the hydrogen in their cores and become red giants, the helium accumulating in their cores reaches degeneracy before it ignites. When the degenerate core reaches a critical mass of about 0.45 solar masses, helium fusion is ignited and takes off in a runaway fashion, called the helium flash, briefly increasing the star's energy production to a rate 100 billion times normal. About 6% of the core is quickly converted into carbon. While the release is sufficient to convert the core back into normal plasma after a few seconds, it does not disrupt the star, nor immediately change its luminosity. The star then contracts, leaving the red giant phase and continuing its evolution into a stable helium-burning phase. =Novae= A nova results from runaway hydrogen fusion (via the CNO cycle) in the outer layer of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star. If a white dwarf has a companion star from which it can accrete gas, the material will accumulate in a surface layer made degenerate by the dwarf's intense gravity. Under the right conditions, a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen is eventually heated to a temperature of 20 million K, igniting runaway fusion. The surface layer is blasted off the white dwarf, increasing luminosity by a factor on the order of 50,000. The white dwarf and companion remain intact, however, so the process can repeat. A much rarer type of nova may occur when the outer layer that ignites is composed of helium. =X-ray bursts= Analogous to the process leading to novae, degenerate matter can also accumulate on the surface of a neutron star that is accreting gas from a close companion. If a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen accumulates, ignition of runaway hydrogen fusion can then lead to an X-ray burst. As with novae, such bursts tend to repeat and may also be triggered by helium or even carbon fusion. It has been proposed that in the case of \\"superbursts\\", runaway breakup of accumulated heavy nuclei into iron group nuclei via photodissociation rather than nuclear fusion could contribute the majority of the energy of the burst. =Type Ia supernovae= A type Ia supernova results from runaway carbon fusion in the core of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star. If a white dwarf, which is composed almost entirely of degenerate matter, can gain mass from a companion, the increasing temperature and density of material in its core will ignite carbon fusion if the star's mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. This leads to an explosion that completely disrupts the star. Luminosity increases by a factor of greater than 5 billion. One way to gain the additional mass would be by accreting gas from a giant star (or even main sequence) companion. A second and apparently more common mechanism to generate the same type of explosion is the merger of two white dwarfs. =Pair-instability supernovae= A pair-instability supernova is believed to result from runaway oxygen fusion in the core of a massive, 130‚Äì250 solar mass, low to moderate metallicity star. According to theory, in such a star, a large but relatively low density core of nonfusing oxygen builds up, with its weight supported by the pressure of gamma rays produced by the extreme temperature. As the core heats further, the gamma rays eventually begin to pass the energy threshold needed for collision-induced decay into electron-positron pairs, a process called pair production. This causes a drop in the pressure within the core, leading it to contract and heat further, causing more pair production, a further pressure drop, and so on. The core starts to undergo gravitational collapse. At some point this ignites runaway oxygen fusion, releasing enough energy to obliterate the star. These explosions are rare, perhaps about one per 100,000 supernovae. =Comparison to nonrunaway supernovae= Not all supernovae are triggered by runaway nuclear fusion. Type Ib, Ic and type II supernovae also undergo core collapse, but because they have exhausted their supply of atomic nuclei capable of undergoing exothermic fusion reactions, they collapse all the way into neutron stars, or in the higher-mass cases, stellar black holes, powering explosions by the release of gravitational potential energy (largely via release of neutrinos). It is the absence of runaway fusion reactions that allows such supernovae to leave behind compact stellar remnants.

The album marks the debut of Sara Lund, who became the band's longest serving and last drummer. Background While being the first studio album in the band's catalog to be released, it is actually the second album by the group to be recorded. A first full-length was recorded in 1992 with drummer Brandt Sandeno, who left the group shortly after recording to do other things. That album was shelved and was not released until 1995, after the group already released 3 full-lengths via Kill Rock Stars. As suggested by Sandeno, Sara Lund was chosen as his replacement. Her drumming style would shape the band from their initial rugged hardcore punk sound to the more post-hardcore style that is presented on this album. Recording Fake Train was recorded and mixed during 2 weekends. In retrospect, Sara Lund expressed her distaste for her performance on the album, for she believed she performed very poorly on it. The entire first side of the record was overdubbed with amplifier feedback. The album was released as the band's full-length debut on Kill Rock Stars on CD, LP, and cassette formats. They would continue to release most of their recordings through Kill Rock Stars until their break-up in 2001. Fake Train was also the first music-only recording released by Kill Rock Stars; releases made before Fake Train on the label were spoken word pieces. Cover The cover art is a vandalized copy of Tom Jones' 1970 album Tom. It was chosen as the cover art last minute as a sort of joke. Reception Few reviews of the album itself exist. Allmusic's Keith Farley gave the album a mixed score of 3 stars out of 5, writing that it \\"bursts out of the gate with the opener \\"Dragnalus\\" and tears through a dozen songs of prime indie-grindcore, including \\"Star Spangled Hell\\" and \\"Pure Pain Sugar\\"\\". Michael Azzerad and Ira Robbins of Trouser Press were more positive, writing that the album \\"boasts a formidable dynamic range, from the meditative instrumental \\"Were, Are and Was or Is,\\" which pours sublimely chirping feedback over dappled guitar arpeggios, through the pile-driving \\"Pure Pain Sugar\\" and up to the apoplectic heights of \\"Lucky Acid\\" and the schizo noise bursts of the aptly named \\"Nervous Energy\\"\\". Despite criticizing Justin Trosper's vocals as \\"generic indie-rock holler\\" and the album's general lack of hooks, they found them to be \\"more than compensated for by the band's inventive attack (especially by Lund) and the sheer number of cool sounds and textures that festoon every track.\\" Legacy The album received a lot more critical attention upon its re-release through the Rat Conspiracy box-set (which also included the follow-up New Plastic Ideas alongside other material recorded by the band during that time period) in 2014. Jason Heller of Pitchfork wrote that the album \\"lurches, twists, and turns in on itself, as if manifesting some perverse, extended metaphor for the feedback that laces nearly ever track.\\" The tracks ‚ÄúValentine Card‚Äù, ‚ÄúKantina‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWere, Are and Was or Is‚Äù were compared to the trilogy consisting of the tracks ‚ÄúThe Wonder‚Äù, ‚ÄúHyperstation‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEliminator Jr.‚Äù off Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation. \\"Fake Train and New Plastic Ideas\\" he writes towards the end of the review, \\"hold important places in the history of 90s music, not to mention those of punk and indie as a whole [...] [T]hose two albums [...] transcend time, place, attitude, and even the sprawling continuum of influence. More than any other records of their generation, they embody a paradox that disaffected youth has been stabbing at since the advent of rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll: how it feels to be cocooned among strangers in utter alienation, yet stand as one.\\" The A.V. Club, in an article suggesting that Unwound were one of the best bands of the '90s, noted \\"a layer of grunge grime on Unwound‚Äôs early records, conceived at the same time Nirvana was kicking around in Unwound‚Äôs backyard‚Äîand Trosper has admitted the inspiration. That might have gone both ways, though; listening to the strangled, wiry riffage of In Utero, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine it as a companion piece to Fake Train.\\" Treble gave the album an 8.4 out of 10, writing that \\"no song on Fake Train is so abrasive as to be inaccessible, but it‚Äôs certainly one of the loudest and most chaotic of the band‚Äôs records, Trosper rarely singing in a register that isn‚Äôt a strained yelp. And he is, to his credit, particularly adept at yelping. There aren‚Äôt many moments on the album that allow breathing room [...] But by and large, the attractions are the direct, dissonant punk tracks like opener ‚ÄúDragnalus,‚Äù which, in simple arrangements and progressions, show just how peculiar‚Äîand awesome‚Äîthe Washingtonian band's take on post-hardcore really was.\\" In popular culture The song \\"Dragnalus\\" appears on the soundtrack to the independent film Half- Cocked.

Silver Bank ()√Åreas protegidas de la Rep√∫blica Dominicana - Santuario de los Bancos de la Plata y de la Navidad is a submerged bank in the Atlantic Ocean north of the Dominican Republic and southeast of the Territory of Turks & Caicos. It covers an area of .Michael L. Frankel, The Voyage of SABRA: An Ecological Cruise Through the Caribbean It is separated from Mouchoir Bank in the west by Silver Bank Passage, and from Navidad Bank in the east by Navidad Bank Passage. Geography Humpback whale calf at South Bank Silver Bank is a shallow underwater carbonate platform that almost reaches the ocean's surface in certain areas ( deep in the shallow parts), but is mostly submerged. In its northern reaches many coral heads reach the ocean surface, especially at low tide. Also, amongst the coral heads is the wrecked freighter Polyxeni, most of which is above the surface. Persons can board the Polyxeni only with governmental permission. Because the Silver Bank is shallow, it is not suitable for large ships to use the area for passage. In fact, any boats in the area should obtain permission before entering the bank. This area is considered a part of the Dominican Republic, as is Navidad Bank east of it. On Oct. 14, 1986, the Dominican Republic established the Silver and Navidad Bank Sanctuary (Santuario de los Bancos de la Plata y de la Navidad) to protect this area as a safe haven for sea mammals. On July 5, 1996, a Dominican presidential decree enlarged the area and declared it the 'Sanctuary for Marine Mammals' (Santuario de Mam√≠feros Marinos). The Silver Bank has long been a breeding and calving area for humpback whales.Reserva Cientifica Santuario de Mamiferos Marinos Bancos Bancos de la Plata y Navidad As such, tourism centers around tours to view the whales and other wildlife. Just to the southeast is Navidad Bank, also under the jurisdiction of the Dominican Republic.

This colorless, odorless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water. It is used in various skin-care products. Glycolic acid is found in some sugar-crops. A glycolate or glycollate is a salt or ester of glycolic acid.  History  The name \\"glycolic acid\\" was coined in 1848 by French chemist Auguste Laurent (1807‚Äì1853). He proposed that the amino acid glycine‚Äîwhich was then called glycocolle‚Äîmight be the amine of a hypothetical acid, which he called \\"glycolic acid\\" (acide glycolique).Laurent, Auguste (1848). \\"Sur les acides amid√©s et le sucre de g√©latine\\" (\\"On aminated acids and the sugar of gelatine [i.e., glycine]\\"), Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 3rd series, 23: 110‚Äì123. From p. 112: \\"Appelons ce dernier acide glycolique ... \\" (\\"Let us call the latter 'glycolic acid' ...\\") Glycolic acid was first prepared in 1851 by German chemist Adolph Strecker (1822‚Äì1871) and Russian chemist Nikolai Nikolaevich Sokolov (1826‚Äì1877). They produced it by treating hippuric acid with nitric acid and nitrogen dioxide to form an ester of benzoic acid and glycolic acid (C6H5C(=O)OCH2COOH), which they called \\"benzoglycolic acid\\" (Benzoglykols√§ure; also benzoyl glycolic acid). They boiled the ester for days with dilute sulfuric acid, thereby obtaining benzoic acid and glycolic acid (Glykols√§ure).Socoloff, Nicolaus and Strecker, Adolph (1851) \\"Untersuchung einiger aus der Hippurs√§ure entstehenden Producte\\" (\\"Investigation of some products that arise from hippuric acid\\"), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 80: 17‚Äì43. For their production of glycolic acid, see pp. 34‚Äì37. Note: Strecker and Sokolov's empirical formula for glycolic acid (viz, C4H4O6) was incorrect, because like many chemists at that time, they used the wrong atomic masses for carbon (6 instead of 12) and for oxygen (8 instead of 16).(Socoloff and Strecker, 1851), p. 37. In recognition of Laurent's correct surmise, Strecker and Sokolov named glycolic acid: \\"Die in dem Barytsalz enthaltene S√§ure C4H3O5 oder als S√§urehydrat gedacht C4H4O6 kommt mit der S√§ure √ºberein, als deren Amidverbindung man das Glycocoll betrachten kann, und welche daher von Laurent den Namen Glycols√§ure erhalten hat.\\" (The acid C4H3O5 contained in the barium salt ‚Äî or considered as the acid hydrate C4H4O6 ‚Äî is consistent with the acid whose amide can be regarded as glycocoll and which therefore obtained from Laurent the name \\"glycolic acid\\".)  Preparation  Glycolic acid can be synthesized in various ways. The predominant approaches use a catalyzed reaction of formaldehyde with synthesis gas (carbonylation of formaldehyde), for its low cost.D.J. Loder, (1939). It is also prepared by the reaction of chloroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide followed by re-acidification. Other methods, not noticeably in use, include hydrogenation of oxalic acid, and hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin derived from formaldehyde. Some of today's glycolic acids are formic acid- free. Glycolic acid can be isolated from natural sources, such as sugarcane, sugar beets, pineapple, cantaloupe and unripe grapes. Glycolic acid can also be prepared using an enzymatic biochemical process that may require less energy.Thaipolychemicals Properties Glycolic acid is slightly stronger than acetic acid due to the electron-withdrawing power of the terminal hydroxyl group. The carboxylate group can coordinate to metal ions forming coordination complexes. Of particular note are the complexes with Pb2+ and Cu2+ which are significantly stronger than complexes with other carboxylic acids. This indicates that the hydroxyl group is involved in complex formation, possibly with the loss of its proton. Applications Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent,http://www2.dupont.com/Glycolic_Acid/en_US/uses_apps/industrial/ind_pgs/leather_tanning.html in food processing as a flavoring agent and as a preservative, and in the pharmaceutical industry as a skin care agent. It is also used in adhesives and plastics.thefreedictionary.com Glycolic acid is often included in emulsion polymers, solvents and additives for ink and paint in order to improve flow properties and impart gloss. It is used in surface treatment products that increase the coefficient of friction on tile flooring. It is the active ingredient in the household cleaning liquid Pine-Sol. = Skin care = Due to its capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid finds applications in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel. Physician-strength peels can have a pH as low as 0.6 (strong enough to completely keratolyze the epidermis), while acidities for home peels can be as low as 2.5. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the stratum corneum to be exfoliated, exposing live skin cells. = Organic synthesis = Glycolic acid is a useful intermediate for organic synthesis, in a range of reactions including: oxidation-reduction, esterification and long chain polymerization. It is used as a monomer in the preparation of polyglycolic acid and other biocompatible copolymers (e.g. PLGA). Commercially, important derivatives include the methyl (CAS# 96-35-5) and ethyl (CAS# 623-50-7) esters which are readily distillable (boiling points 147‚Äì149 ¬∞C and 158‚Äì159 ¬∞C, respectively), unlike the parent acid. The butyl ester (b.p. 178‚Äì186 ¬∞C) is a component of some varnishes, being desirable because it is nonvolatile and has good dissolving properties.Karlheinz Miltenberger \\"Hydroxycarboxylic Acids, Aliphatic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. = Agriculture = Many plants make glycolic acid during photorespiration. Its role consumes significant amounts of energy. In 2017 researchers announced a process that employs a novel protein to reduce energy consumption/loss and prevent plants from releasing harmful ammonia. The process converts glycolate into glycerate without using the conventional BASS6 and PLGG1 route. Safety Glycolic acid is a strong irritant depending on pH. Like ethylene glycol, it is metabolized to oxalic acid, which could make it dangerous if ingested. References COMBINATION OF MICRONEEDLING AND GLYCOLIC ACID PEELS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACNE SCARS?

She is the second Navy ship named for United States Coast Guard Captain Charles Satterlee. Satterlee was laid down on 10 September 1941 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington and launched on 17 July 1942; sponsored by Miss Rebecca E. Satterlee, niece of Capt. Satterlee. The ship was commissioned on 1 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander Joseph F. Witherow, Jr., in command. Service history Satterlee escorted the British aircraft carrier, , from the Western Seaboard to the Atlantic coast, where the new destroyer joined the U.S. Atlantic Fleet on 26 August 1943. After two convoy escort voyages to Casablanca, and training out of Casco Bay, Maine, she escorted the battleships and to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in April 1944. In the first week of May 1944, Satterlee underwent training for a special mission assigned to her for the Normandy landings. She was to support a crack unit of 200 Army Rangers in eliminating a German gun battery at Pointe du Hoc which commanded the Omaha landing beaches. After escorting minesweepers to the beach area on the night of 5 and 6 June, she commenced pre-arranged fire on Pointe du Hoc at 05:48, 6 June. As the Rangers landed, she broke up enemy units attempting to oppose them from the top of the cliff. Although the rangers found that the battery's guns had been removed before the landings, German resistance was stiff, and Satterlee provided gunfire support for the rest of the day. Satterlee remained off the Normandy beaches for the next forty days, and then joined the invasion force which arrived off Saint-Tropez, southern France, on 15 August 1944. Here she helped repel a night attack of five German motor torpedo boats, sinking one from which she rescued 12 survivors. Satterlee returned to the east coast in October 1944 for training at Casco Bay. In January and February 1945, she escorted the cruiser , with President Franklin D. Roosevelt embarked, on the Norfolk‚ÄìBermuda portion of his trip to and from the Yalta Conference. She next sailed for the Pacific, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 16 May 1945 for duty as a gunnery school ship. She also provided escort for the aircraft carriers , , and during night and day flight operations off Hawaii. On 4 July, Satterlee left Pearl Harbor and commenced air-sea rescue patrol duty between Saipan and Okinawa and performed this duty for the rest of the war and the initial months of the occupation. On 9 November, she began her trip back to the United States for inactivation. Satterlee was decommissioned on 16 March 1946 and placed in reserve at Charleston, South Carolina She was struck from the Navy list on 1 December 1970. Satterlee received two battle stars for her World War II service. Henry Fonda also served on the ship, as a Quartermaster 3rd Class.

Early life and music career  Moss was born and raised in Los Angeles. He grew up surrounded by the theatre, concert, and rock & roll music world. At age 11, he started learning to play the drums, guitar and electric bass. In 1976, Moss joined creative forces with fellow singer/guitarist Peter Beckett, guitarist/keyboardist J.C Crowley, and drummer John Friesen to form the band Player, primarily as bassist and singer. In a garage in the Hollywood Hills, they wrote and rehearsed the music that would soon attract the attention of music impresario Robert Stigwood, who signed them to his RSO Records. In the first three weeks of 1978, their single \\"Baby Come Back\\" occupied the #1 position on the national pop charts & Player was voted to the Billboard magazine honor roll of Top New Singles artist of 1978. Their follow-up single, \\"This Time I'm in It for Love,\\", also peaked at No. 10 the same year. \\"Baby Come Back\\" was next to \\"Sara Smile\\" by Hall & Oates as well as \\"How Much I Feel\\" by Ambrosia as one of the very few songs by a white artist to be played on predominantly black radio stations. This enabled them to contribute to a musical genre known as \\"Blue-Eyed Soul\\", where white artists sing with a strong R & B Influence. The Australian edition of his 2002 solo CD I‚Äôm Your Man includes a fresh duet of the original hit \\"Baby Come Back\\" and two bonus tracks: \\"That's When I'll Be Gone\\" and \\"Mountain\\". Moss along with his band toured Australia between August and September 2006. In 2007, he released his second solo album, Uncovered. Player went on tour in 2015, with Moss and Peter Beckett playing dates with Orleans and Ambrosia as well as a few \\"Yacht Rock\\" shows with Little River Band. After a lawsuit against former PLAYER bandmate, Peter Beckett for the use of the trademark name, Ronn will debut his band as Ronn Moss' PLAYER for future PLAYER concerts. Ronn is now solo and toured Australia again in March 2019 and is currently touring Italy for the first time in the summer of 2019. The Bold and the Beautiful and other acting work Moss played the Saracen hero Ruggero who fell in love with Bradamante in the 1983 Italian film Paladini-storia d'armi e d'amori (aka Paladins‚Äîthe story of love and arms, aka Hearts and Armor)[1] ‚Äì a film based on the legends surrounding the Peers of Charlemagne. In 1987, Moss was offered the role of \\"Ridge Forrester\\" on a new soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He accepted the part, and the show was broadcast in many nations across the globe[2] and his role has attracted millions of fans worldwide. To this day, Moss is best known for this role and he frequently travels overseas to visit other countries, make appearances, and promote his music. 1987 also marks the year of Moss' most critically acclaimed theatrical role as Rowdy Abilene in the Andy Sidaris classic Hard Ticket to Hawaii. Moss has a large fan base in Australia. In 2006, a campaign surfaced to vote Moss as Australian of the Year. Moss was featured in a very popular television commercial for Berri, an Australian orange juice producer. The punchline of the advertisement was \\"you can tell when it's not all Aussie\\"‚Äî a line intended to show (in jest) that, while Moss has longstanding connections with Australia, his Hollywood career has resulted in his persona differing significantly from that of the clich√© Australian male. He has appeared occasionally on the former program Rove Live when in Australia. He takes part in sketches that are parodies of the daytime TV genre. The Bold and the Beautiful was a very popular prime-time show in much of Europe; in 2010, Moss was a participant in the Italian version of Dancing with the Stars, finishing second with his partner Sara Di Vaira. On August 11, 2012, it was announced that Moss would exit The Bold and the Beautiful, after having played the character of Ridge Forrester for 25 years. He made his last appearance on September 14, 2012. On May 12, 2014, Moss, along with his band Player, appeared on the ABC daytime soap opera General Hospital as part of the 2014 Nurses' Ball, where they performed their hit single \\"Baby Come Back\\". In 2015, he played the character of Ian in the Flemish soap Familie. Ronn played the role of John Blackwell on the digital soap \\"The Bay,\\" and as one of its producers shared in the four Daytime Emmys it received for \\"Outstanding Daytime Digital Drama Series\\".

It is located off Highway 50 (Geneva Street), near Interstate 43. Lake Lawn has its own private airport, Lake Lawn Airport.  History  The north shore of Delavan Lake, where Lake Lawn Resort is situated, was occupied by Native Americans as early as 1000 BC. The resort's construction unearthed many artifacts from these tribes that are currently on display throughout the facility. The original hotel was built there in 1879 as a place for members of the Mabie Circus to stay. When the circus was bought by Barnum and Bailey, it became the winter headquarters of that circus. Famously, when one of Barnum and Bailey's stage elephants died, the circus owners ordered that the elephant be pushed out onto the middle of the lake (conveniently the lake was frozen for the winter). Come springtime and thaw, the semi-preserved elephant's corpse sank under the water once the ice was sufficiently thin. In 1923, Lake Lawn Lodge became a retreat for the employees of Commonwealth Edison, People's Light and Coke Company, and the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois. Commonwealth Edison added numerous facilities, including a golf course (opened 1928) and a ballroom. In 1929, Commonwealth Edison sold the property, and the new owner opened the hotel to the public; by 1942, the hotel would be open year-round. As the number of vacationers grew, the resort expanded, adding new dining and shopping facilities, a convention center, a remodeled golf course, and its own airport (opened 1948). Guest facilities expanded dramatically, with the addition of Timber Lodge (with an indoor pool and health club, 1958); Boulder Lodge (1962); Woodlawn Lodge (with its own indoor pool, 1968); the paired Shorewood Lodges (1973); and Norwood Lodge (1980). The ballroom burnt to the ground in spectacular fashion in 1978. Under the management of Ramada Inns, the resort added a new reception desk (1980) and outdoor pool (1985). Owing to its age, the majority of the main hotel was demolished in 1984, though the lobby of the main hotel was preserved and renamed the Great Room. Dick Nugent would redesign the golf course in 1990. The resort underwent many ownership changes between 1990 and 2005. During this time, the complex added the slogan \\"Resort to the Finest\\"; shortly thereafter, it became \\"Lake Lawn Resort\\". Each change brought a round of renovations to public areas, guest rooms, or the golf course. Delavan Resort Holdings purchased the property in 2004 and embarked on an ambitious $390 million redevelopment plan. $40 million in renovations were completed in 2006 on all of the guest rooms, as well as Timber Pool; the health club area in Timber Lodge became a spa. Woodlawn Lodge, the only guest lodge not connected to the rest of the complex by a walkway, was completely emptied and remodeled using a \\"coastal\\" theme into Lakewood Suites; an outdoor pool was added to replace Woodlawn's indoor pool. As part of the redevelopment plan, the entire resort became a condotel, with individual rooms sold as condominium units and \\"rented\\" to vacationers. Delavan Resort Holdings would break a major contract involving these \\"condotel\\" holdings, leading to a $13.1 million lawsuit.  Today  The present resort contains nearly 300 guest rooms, a conference center (with 22 meeting rooms), three restaurants, a gift shop, a golf course, driving range, airport, marina, three pools, game room, and a spa. On August 5, 2009, Anchor Bank of Madison foreclosed on the property; the bank would then buy the entire resort for $19.97 million at the foreclosure sale on October 7, 2010. Exactly two months later, Lake Lawn Resort was closed, putting 276 employees out of work. Six months after, a group of investors headed by local philanthropist Jim Drescher formed Delavan Lake Lawn LLC and purchased the property for $9.5 million, with plans to reopen the facility as a resort. The golf course and marina reopened on May 27, 2011. The rest of the resort reopened on July 22, 2011. Though the airport is unmanned, the runway has been reopened. References Bell, Ellen Baker.

The commune, based in Besut, Terengganu, was demolished by the government of Malaysia in August 2005. As of 2006, Ayah Pin was residing in exile in Narathiwat, Thailand, just over the border from Kelantan. Eighteen members of the Sky Kingdom commune remain at the mercy of the Malaysia's Higher Shariah Court, with 40 having received leniency upon renouncing the group.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzJbWUjSfyA Sky Kingdom attracted worldwide mass media attention in mid-2005, over concerns about efforts by the Malaysian government to suppress its followers as apostates from Islam. The controversy brought to light the issue of whether sharia law superseded the right to religious freedom under Article 11 of the Constitution of Malaysia. This attention was coupled with considerable bemusement over followers' central objects of veneration, which include a large cream-coloured teapot, prompting local and foreign media to dub the sect as the \\"teapot cult\\". Sky Kingdom commune The , 33-building complex was located near the village of Kampung Batu 13, Hulu Besut, in the Besut district in northern Terengganu (some 400 km north of Kuala Lumpur and 20 km from Jerteh). Sky Kingdom had existed on the site since the mid-1980s, though the group itself dates back to the late 1970s. Before the commune was demolished, the group supported itself through rubber tapping, religious tourism, and confectionery production. =Following= The Malaysian government has described the \\"teapot cult\\" of Sky Kingdom as one of 22 \\"heretical\\" Islamic \\"sects\\" or \\"cults\\" in Malaysia, which altogether have an estimated 22,800 adherents. Most estimates of the numbers of followers of Sky Kingdom put them at several thousand, though this number would heavily depend on the criteria used for inclusion. As few as 25 now live on the commune, down from about 120 prior to the demolitions. Followers are mostly Malays but also include Africans, Indians, and British believers. One adherent is from New Zealand. Besides Malaysia, members are also said to be located in Singapore and Bali. =Beliefs and practices= A Muslim by birth, Ariffin, also known as Ayah Pin, claims to have direct contact with the heavens and is believed by his followers to be the reincarnation of Jesus, Buddha, Shiva, and Muhammad. Devotees of Sky Kingdom believe that one day, Ayah Pin will return as the Imam Mahdi. His followers consider him the king of the sky, and the supreme object of devotion for all religions. A major emphasis of the Sky Kingdom religion is ecumenical dialogue and inter-religious harmony. People of different religious backgrounds have joined. Ayah Pin has visited several Hindu temples and the group once hosted a visit by a Christian group, a rare move by Malaysian standards . Ayah Pin accepts the existence of angels, as well as a class of Malaysian forest fairies, called Orang Bunian. The Sky Kingdom also emphasizes the importance of spiritual healing as well as dream interpretation. Ayah Pin used to conduct \\"sessions\\" on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings. According to a witness, the sessions began with a special ritual whereby followers would usher Ayah Pin from the main building to a concrete boat in the compound in which he would lie. His followers would then start chanting for him until 4:00 am. After this ritual, a lengthy question-and-answer period would take place, with Ayah Pin seated on a dais facing an audience. Hymns would also be sung during the session. =Symbols= The commune features some structures which are symbolic of the group's ideology. Some notable symbols include a two-story high cream coloured teapot with a similarly-sized blue vase, costing RM 45 million. The teapot is said to symbolise the purity of water and \\"love pouring from heaven\\". It is the earthly model of a celestial prototype. According to Ayah Pin, it was inspired by the dreams of one of his followers, and reflects a similar vessel in the sky which God uses to shower his blessings on mankind. Followers who visit the commune for the first time have to drink \\"holy water\\" from the vase which is \\"perpetually\\" filled by the teapot. Another notable feature in the compound is an equally large yellow umbrella, which offers \\"a place for people to take shelter beneath God.\\" It is said that this can also be associated with the nine planets in Hinduism.\\" Other symbols present include an ornamental fishing boat, identified with Noah's Ark, and a crescent moon icon symbolising people without a religion, including the Orang Asli (indigenous peoples of peninsular Malaysia) and the aforementioned Orang Bunian. History Ayah Pin, the leader and founder of Sky Kingdom, was born in 1941 in Beris, Kampung Besar Bachok, Kelantan. In 1953, Ayah Pin became seriously ill and he claimed that an angel had visited him. Twenty years later, the angel returned and Ariffin began his spiritual career. In 1975 a spiritual group was formed in Bagan Lebai Tahir, Butterworth, Penang. Whether Ariffin was the founder is unclear; during this phase he may have been a follower of Hassan Ya'acob (also known as Hassan Anak Rimau), another claimant to divinity. In the mid-1980s, the Sky Kingdom commune was formed on its present site in Besut. Some reports state the Office of Islamic Affairs declared the group to be deviant at this time. In 1995, Sky Kingdom's signature building projects began, in accordance with divine revelation. Two years later, the local Religious Affairs Council (Jawatankuasa Fatwa Majlis Agama Islam dan Adat Melayu Terengganu) issued a fatwa against the group. About this time, four adherents were arrested for the crime of renouncing Islam, but they were later freed since as ex-Muslims Malaysia's sharia court no longer has jurisdiction over them. In 2001 Ayah Pin himself renounced Islam. The Sharia court accused him of contravening Section 25 of the Enakmen Pentadbiran Hal Ehwal Agama Islam 1986 (Administration of Islamic Religious Affairs 1986), stating that his teachings and beliefs were \\"false, deviant, corrupting and threatening to the public peace\\" (membawa ancaman kepada ketenteraman orang awam serta merosakkan akidah). He pleaded guilty to a charge of \\"belittling Islam\\" (menghina Islam), and was jailed for 11 months and fined RM 2,900. The Religious Affairs Office hoped that Ariffin's arrest would prevent the movement's growth. However, the Sky Kingdom continued to attract new followers from university students and Orang Asli. On 18 July 2005, a group of masked vigilantes attacked the group's headquarters, smashing windows and torching buildings. Two days later, 58 Sky Kingdom followers were arrested, and on 31 July three of Ariffin's four wives were arrested in Kelantan. Ariffin escaped capture and remains at large. Forty-five of his followers face the charge of failing to observe the government fatwa by continuing to be \\"members of a sect declared deviant\\", which carries a fine up to RM 3,000 or two years in prison. One of those arrested faced an additional charge of \\"humiliating Islam\\" for claiming no longer to be a Muslim. Court cases will revolve around the right of religious freedom, which is theoretically guaranteed by the Malaysian constitution. On 1 August 2005, officials of the Besut Land Office destroyed Sky Kingdom's buildings, citing Section 129 of the National Land Code, which punishes unauthorised construction with land confiscation. The titular landowner is Ariffin's first wife, who failed to appear in court for a hearing on the ownership. At a 1 September 2005, hearing, a trial date for the 45 followers accused of violating the government fatwa was set for three days beginning 18 December. All of the accused are represented by Wan Haidi Wan Jusoh of Ubaidullah Aziz and Company, who unsuccessfully petitioned the court to order his name blacked out by the media. The Sky Kingdom had previously had great difficulty obtaining legal representation, presumably because of attorneys' fears of reprisals or negative publicity. As of 2007, after wide media coverage, the original Hulu Besut commune, now containing only 24 members, had reportedly chosen a new leader‚Äîa former police chief inspector in his 30s. The group is suspicious of visitors, and routinely turns out the commune's lights when a car approaches at night so as not to be found. In popular culture The Sky Kingdom commune was featured in a documentary titled Massacre Survivors: Malaysia's Secret Sect produced by SBS News dan distributed by Journeyman Pictures. The documentary's video can be seen on Journeyman's YouTube channel.

L√≥√∞urr (also Lodurr) is a god in Norse mythology. In the poem he is assigned a role in animating the first humans, but apart from that he is hardly ever mentioned, and remains obscure. Scholars have variously identified him with Loki, V√©, Vili and Freyr, but consensus has not been reached on any one theory.  Name and etymology  The name's meaning is unknown. It has been speculatively linked to various Old Norse words, such as , \\"fruit, land\\", , \\"people\\" and , \\"to attract\\". The Gothic words , \\"to grow\\" and , \\"shape\\", as well as the German word , \\"to blaze\\", have also been mentioned in this context. The metrical position of L√≥√∞urr's name in the skaldic poem , composed in the strict dr√≥ttkv√¶tt metre, indicates that it contains the sound value /√≥/ rather than /o/. This evidence, while strong, is not incontrovertible and some scholars have held out for a reading. (L√≥√∞urr's name can also be represented or anglicized as , , , , , , , , , , , , , or .) Danish and Norwegian , Swedish , as well as Finnish may possibly derive from , meaning \\"Saturday\\", although more typically the etymology is proposed to originate from \\"washing day\\".  Attestations  = V√∂lusp√° = In the Poetic Edda the name occurs only once; in , where the gods animate the first humans. {  :17. : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : -- Normalized text  :17.

Spirit they possessed not, :sense they had not, :blood nor motive powers, :nor goodly colour. :Spirit gave Odin, :sense gave Hoenir, :blood gave Lodur, :and goodly colour. -- Thorpe's translation  } The precise meaning of these strophes and their context in V√∂lusp√° is debated. Most relevant for the present discussion are L√≥√∞urr's gifts of and . The word is obscure and the translations \\"film of flesh\\" and \\"blood\\" are just two of the many possibilities that have been suggested. The phrase \\"litu g√≥√∞a\\" is somewhat less difficult and traditionally interpreted as \\"good colours\\", \\"good shape\\" or even \\"good looks\\". The 19th- century Swedish scholar Viktor Rydberg proposed a reading of , meaning \\"shape of gods\\", and saw the line as indication that the gods created human beings in their own image. While the manuscripts do not distinguish between the phonemes /o/ and /√≥/, most other scholars have preferred the /√≥/ reading for metrical reasons. The metrical structure of 's fornyr√∞islag is, however, not very rigid and in 1983 Rydberg's theory was championed again by Gro Steinsland. It remains debated. = Other attestations = Apart from the strophe in , L√≥√∞urr's name occurs only twice in the original sources. The name is found in the skaldic poems and where \\"L√≥√∞urr's friend\\" is used as a kenning for Odin. This seems consistent with L√≥√∞urr's role in . In Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, L√≥√∞urr is conspicuously absent. Here the creation of humans is attributed to the sons of Borr, whom Snorri names elsewhere as Odin, Vili and V√©. { ! Normalized text of the R manuscript ! Brodeur's translation - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"padding: 1pt 10pt;font-style:italic;\\"   style=\\"padding: 1pt 10pt;\\"  When the sons of Borr were walking along the sea- strand, they found two trees, and took up the trees and shaped men of them: the first gave them spirit and life; the second, wit and feeling; the third, form, speech, hearing, and sight. They gave them clothing and names: the male was called Askr, and the female Embla, and of them was mankind begotten, which received a dwelling-place under Midgard.  } Snorri often quotes in his work, but in this case he does not. We cannot know whether he knew the strophes above or whether he was working entirely from other sources. = Nordendorf fibula = Another source sometimes brought into the discussion is the Nordendorf fibula. This artifact, dating from about 600 CE, contains the runic inscription loga√æorewodanwigi√æonar. This is usually interpreted as Loga√æore Wodan Wigi√æonar, where Wodan is Odin and Wigi√æonar probably is Thor. It would be natural for loga√æore to be the name of a third god, but there is no obvious identification in Norse mythology as we know it. Both L√≥√∞urr and Loki have been proposed, but the etymological reasoning is tenuous, and firm conclusions cannot be reached.  Theories  Since the Prose Edda mentions the sons of Borr in the same context as V√∂lusp√° does H≈ìnir and L√≥√∞urr, some scholars have reasoned that L√≥√∞urr might be another name for either Vili or V√©. Viktor Rydberg was an early proponent of this theory, but recently it has received little attention. A more popular theory proposed by the scholar Ursula Dronke is that L√≥√∞urr is \\"a third name of Loki/Loptr\\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H≈ìnir and Loki occur as a trio in Haustl√∂ng, in the prose prologue to Reginsm√°l and also in the Loka T√°ttur a Faroese ballad which is a rare example of the occurrence of Norse gods in folklore. The Odin-kenning \\"L√≥√∞urr's friend\\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \\"Loptr's friend\\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \\"H≈ìnir's friend\\" in Haustl√∂ng, strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in , seemingly conflicting with the image of L√≥√∞urr as a \\"mighty and loving\\" figure. Many scholars, including Jan de Vries and Georges Dum√©zil, have also identified L√≥√∞urr as being the same deity as Loki. Recently, Haukur √ûorgeirsson of the University of Iceland suggested that Loki and L√≥√∞urr were different names of the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L√≥√∞ur in the rimur . Haukur argues that whatever if the rimur is based on Snorri's or a folksource the writer must have had the information about the identification from either a tradition or drawing the conclusion based on Edda poems, since Snorri does not mention L√≥√∞urr in his Edda. Since the contents of the Poetic Edda are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the rimur was written Haukur argues for a traditional identification. Haukur also points to where the same identification is made with Loki and L√≥√∞urr. Haukur √ûorgeirsson says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th and 15th century poets possessed lost written sources unknown to us, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L√≥√∞urr are identical like some recent scholars or that there still were remnants of an oral tradition. Haukur concludes that if L√≥√∞urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence An identification with Freyr has also been proposed. This theory emphasizes the possible fertility-related meanings of L√≥√∞urr's name but otherwise has little direct evidence to support it.

He migrated from Scotland in 1834, settling in Upper Canada. Adam Hope sent his father sixty-six letters, vivid and detailed, which trace Hope's passage across the Atlantic and efforts to settle in Upper Canada. A Liberal, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada on 3 January 1877 on the recommendation of Alexander Mackenzie. He represented the senatorial division of Hamilton, Ontario until his death. In 2007, Crerer Adam edited the selected letters of Adam Hope, written to his father in Scotland between 1834-1845. This collection of letters totals approximately 200,000 words, and represents one of the single richest accounts of Upper Canada in the 1830s and 1840s, touching on telling aspects of colonial politics, religion, society, economics, and communications.

It is the second in the series which began with In The Garden of Iden and continues with Mendoza in Hollywood. Plot introduction The preceding novel, In The Garden of Iden, introduced the Botanist Mendoza, from her time of recruitment in the dungeons of the Spanish Inquisition to her love affair with a mortal in Tudor England, followed by her being sent to base New World One in the Americas. Her recruiter and also her superior on the England mission was a much older operative, Joseph, who is the narrator of this novel. The story begins almost 150 years after Mendoza's arrival at New World One, when Joseph arrives there in the dying days of 1699 with a new mission in California. This episode focuses on operatives Lewis, Latif and Imarte, all of whom have roles in future stories. Plot summary Joseph's latest role is that of Sky Coyote, the trickster, the foolish one, the animal god of many Native American traditions. He will play it for the Chumash, a tribe in California in the late 17th century. His job is to persuade the village of Humashup to give up their entire lifestyle, which the Company will take and \\"preserve,\\" while the Chumash are shipped out to work in a Company facility. The Spanish are coming soon, and the Chumash culture will be wiped out along with all the others. Of course, Joseph can't do this alone. He assembles a small army of his kind, including the erratic and moody botanist Mendoza, whom he occasionally regrets recruiting in 16th-century Spain; the anthropologist and former Babylonian Imarte; who is not averse to bedding her subjects to get more data; and many other specialists. Joseph is the Master of Ceremonies, however. He's also wearing a lot of non-standard equipment to turn him into a cavorting, fast talking (and priapic) god. The Chumash turn out to be, well, ordinary. Superb craftsmen, their lives revolve around work, festivals, religion, festivals, getting ahead, and festivals. They may not have churches and boys clubs, but the kantap fills the same needs. The guilds make sure that everybody gets what they need and pays handsomely for it. Oily salesmen try to make their percentage any way they can. Joseph is a little surprised to learn that they are so worldly, and they are quite surprised that he, well, exists. However Joseph spins his tale with his usual skill and pulls off the job. There are snags, but not the usual kind. For a start, actual 24th-century Company operatives have come back to supervise. They are disgusted that the cyborgs eat meat, drink alcohol and consume other stimulants banned in their era. The cyborgs are not too impressed with the childish, phobia-ridden operatives either, but a job is a job. Mendoza starts her feud with Imarte, which continues in the next installment. There is a messianic religion encroaching on Chumash territory. This gets Joseph's hackles up. Nature throws in an earthquake or two. The Chumash go to their reward, the Company gets all the valuable information and samples it needs to sell to the rich and not-so-smart in the 24th century, and Joseph is left with a nagging doubt. For one thing, why does nobody know what happens after 2355, even though all history is available to the cyborgs up to that point? And why do cyborgs who talk too much about this tend to get suddenly reassigned? Why do the 24th-century people seem so cowardly and stupid? Didn't they go all the way back to 30,000 BC to start the ball rolling? Or was it 40,000? Nobody is quite sure. However, Joseph is mostly satisfied, but unfulfilled and, at his core, unhappy. Mendoza has been released to wander the redwood forest, a dream task for the botanist. Joseph believes that in 1923 he saw her with a mortal she fell for in Tudor England, but that story is not completed in this volume. Joseph has more or less adopted Mendoza as his daughter, though he cannot admit it. By the end of the book he has become a 20th-century Hollywood studio executive, hiding artifacts of the era for the Company. Characters * Joseph, Facilitator par excellence. Like all agents of The Company, Joseph is an immortal cyborg. He is older than most, having been converted from a human child in about 20,000 BC, give or take a thousand. Since he was about to have his brains bashed in when he was taken, he thinks he came out of it pretty well. Joseph has always been a Company man, playing role after role for them as they 'preserve' the past for 'discovery' in the future, a business which is very lucrative indeed. * Budu, seen only in Joseph's flashbacks, Budu is the archaic Homo sapiens Enforcer who recruited Joseph, and who Joseph considers to be his father. Few in the Company know about Enforcers, who were part of an old Company mission to slaughter violent groups in pre-historical times. Now, almost no Enforcers are left. Budu warns Joseph of some potential ill-doings surrounding their disappearance, and implants in Joseph a file with more information, which Joseph refuses to open. Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science The Chumash were a real tribe in the location described.

He acted to block the northward progress of Nitta Yoshisada, who supported the Emperor's Southern Court against the sh≈çguns Northern Court. Shiba, in his role as Constable, served the sh≈çgun and thus the Northern Court. In 1336, an ally of Nitta named Ury≈´ Tamotsu attacked Shiba's castle, which fell soon afterwards. Two years later, Shiba was ordered by the shogun Ashikaga Takauji to attack Ury≈´'s fortress at Somayama. The attack failed, and Shiba was forced to fight Nitta's forces again in the defense of the Kuromaru (Black Fortress). With the aid of forces sent by Takauji and warrior monks from Heisenji, the fortress was held, and Nitta Yoshisada mortally wounded in the battle. Despite this great victory, Shiba was defeated once again in 1340, when the newly throned Emperor Go-Murakami sent an army to attack the Kuromaru. Shiba was forced to surrender. The same year, a number of men claiming to serve Shiba invaded an area called Kawaguchi-sh≈ç, which was controlled by the K≈çfuku-ji temple. In 1363 Shiba seized the area officially, becoming essentially a daimy≈ç (feudal lord), gaining independent power beyond what was given him by the Shogunate. The monks of K≈çfuku-ji resorted to various forms of blackmail and were granted their land back. However, Shiba continued to gain power, instituting shugo- uke, a system under which the Constable would take a set amount of rice from the people of the land, paying the peoples' taxes to the Shogun and keeping the rest as a sort of commission. Of those few Constables who became lords in their own right, most if not all abused this system, earning great revenues for themselves.

This raised national attention and led to the removal of the shirts from several thousand retail outlets. The publicity of the campaign increased sales of the shirt, which features the slogan printed next to a cartoon image of a boy running away from five stones flying in his direction, which was later used as the cover of a book which was also titled Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them! T-shirt The T-shirt was designed by company founder Todd Goldman, who started David and Goliath in 1999 with \\"Boys are Smelly\\" T-shirts. It now features clothes with a variety of slogans, such as \\"Boys tell lies, poke them in the eyes!\\" or \\"The stupid factory, where boys are made\\". \\"Boys are stupid ...\\" has evolved into a successful object for merchandise, which includes all types of clothes, mugs, key chains, posters and other items. In 2005, Goldman published a book with the same title. Reaction Los Angeles based radio host and men's rights activist Glenn Sacks initiated a campaign against the T-shirts in 2003. He claimed that they were part of a general societal mood that stigmatizes and victimizes boys. The company says that the shirts are not meant to encourage violence. According to Goldman, the controversy boosted sales of the T-shirt. Helen Grieco, executive director of the National Organization for Women, stated \\"No, I don't think the shirts are cute. But I spend every day on life-and-death issues and don't have time for T-shirt campaigns.\\" She went on to state that while she believed the US needed a men's rights movement, she didn't think Sacks should be the one doing it, calling him a \\"women-bashing, backlash shock-jock radio host.\\" Others, like San Francisco Chronicle columnist Jane Ganahl ridiculed Sacks' efforts in an article saying, \\"shut up and get a life, already\\". Glenn Sacks responded to criticism of the campaign, asserting that the criticism was dismissive of the feelings of boys and that the idea that boys should laugh at the joke at their expense creates a double bind for boys. In Canada, the complaints by the Canadian Children's Rights Council resulted in numerous major retail chain stores stopping their sales of the merchandise. Other retailers who pulled the merchandise included Bon-Macy's, Tilly's, and Claire's.

He became famous in 1998 with the publication of Junk, about heroin-addicted teenagers on the streets of Bristol. In Britain, Junk became one of the best- known young adult books of the decade. Burgess won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British author. For the 10th anniversary in 2007 it was named one of the top ten Medal-winning works, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. Early life Burgess was born in the Municipal Borough of Twickenham, Middlesex, England (now administered as part of Greater London). Author He completed his first book accepted for publication in his mid-thirties: a novel, The Cry of the Wolf, published by Andersen Press in 1990, which was highly commended by librarians for the Carnegie Medal, which Gillian Cross won for Wolf. Cross features a girl and a metaphorical wolf, the characters being the last grey wolf in Britain. Andersen published all of Burgess' books until the mid-1990s. The Baby and Fly Pie (1993) was another highly commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal, a distinction that was roughly annual. Junk won the 1996 Medal and also the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize judged by a panel of British children's writers, which The Guardian confers only once upon any author. Burgess is one of six authors, all 1967 to 1996, who won the Carnegie Medal for their Guardian Prize-winning books. Kite (1997) features a boy who hatches a red kite egg. Burgess again courted predictable controversy in 2003, with the publication of Doing It, which dealt with underage sex. In the U.S. it was adapted as a television series, Life as We Know It. In other books such as The Ghost Behind the Wall (2000), Burgess has dealt with less realist and sometimes fantastic themes. Bloodtide (1999) and Bloodsong (2007) are post- apocalypse adaptations of Volsunga Saga. In 2001 Burgess wrote the novelisation of the film Billy Elliot, based on Lee Hall's screenplay.

The name \\"Halfway Rock\\" comes from the position of the rock which is halfway between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Small, the southwest and northeast extremities of Casco Bay, which are about apart. Halfway Rock Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Halfway Rock Light Station on March 14, 1988. Halfway Rock Light Station was purchased in 2014 by a private individual, Ford Reiche, per DIY Network's Building Off the Grid program that shows the reclamation and restoration of the property.Building Off the Grid: Maine LighthouseCumberland man works to restore his own private lighthouseFord Reiche paid $283,000 for Halfway Rock, a former Coast Guard lighthouse 4 miles off Harpswell, and he is undertaking a painstaking renovation History The need for a lighthouse on Halfway Rock first came to attention when, in the year 1835, a ship called Samuel ran aground on the rock during a storm. Because the ledge is only ten feet above high tide on a calm day, it becomes hard to see during storms. The cry for a lighthouse was ignored in Washington until, again, in 1861, a ship ran aground on Halfway Rock. This time, it was taken a bit more seriously. Construction began, but was delayed time and time again due to lack of supplies and lack of workmen. Ten years later, in 1871, the first light shone from Halfway Rock, as a new light had been completed. The keepers' quarters were originally inside the lighthouse tower. An 1888 boathouse contained additional living space for the keepers in its upper story. The light was originally produced by a third-order Fresnel lens. Its characteristic was fixed white punctuated by a red flash once every minute. A fog bell was brought to the rock in 1887. It had a bit of success, but as technology kept coming out with new innovations, the bell was replaced with a fog \\"trumpet\\" in 1905. Since this was a difficult lighthouse station to reach, in the mid-1930s, the Coast Guard began bringing a tender to bring the men onto the mainland and back out to the rock. In addition to this, there was a helicopter landing pad in case of emergency. The light was automated in 1975 and the keepers were removed. The marine railway was destroyed by the 1991 Perfect Storm. The old Fresnel lens is now at the museum at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT; the active optic is a VRB-25. The attached wood building was badly damaged by storms in 2007. The lighthouse was licensed to the American Lighthouse Foundation, and the organization raised funds for its restoration. The Halfway Rock Light was sold at auction for $283,000 in September 2014. The historic building restoration was the subject of a 2017 episode of Building Off the Grid.

Magoun and his company invested in the still growing Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to the point where he had become Chairman of the Board for the railroad. In the late 1880s, as the Santa Fe's stock prices fell from $140 per share to around $20 per share, Magoun's health also faltered. Magoun died on December 20, 1893.

She was named for the town of Tuscumbia, Alabama, which had been named for a Cherokee chief. Tuscumbia was built in 1862 at Cincinnati, Ohio, by Joseph Brown; launched on 2 December; and commissioned at Cairo, Illinois; on 12 March 1863, Lieutenant Commander James W. Shirk in command. She had two engines for the two sidewheels and two smaller engines for her two screws. Service history Tuscumbia assisted in the recapture of Fort Heiman on the Tennessee River from 12 March to 14 March 1863. The vessel destroyed Confederate shipping used to ferry troops across the river and enfiladed Southern entrenchments situated behind the fort. At the end of the month, she entered the Mississippi River. In the spring and early summer of 1863, Tuscumbia performed valuable service during amphibious operations against Vicksburg, Mississippi. On 1 April, she carried Admiral David D. Porter and Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman on a reconnaissance expedition up the Yazoo River to determine the practicality of landing a force above Vicksburg at Hayne's Bluff. Tuscumbia withdrew under heavy fire from shore batteries, prompting the decision to shift operations below Vicksburg to Grand Gulf. Tuscumbia participated in the run past the Vicksburg batteries to New Carthage on the night of 16 April and 17 April 1863, towing the damaged transport Forest Queen to safety. On 20 April, USS General Price and Tuscumbia reconnoitered the Mississippi from New Carthage to Grand Gulf and took part in the attack on the Confederate works at Grand Gulf on 29 April. During the attack, Tuscumbia suffered five casualties and was put out of action after taking 81 hits. Tuscumbia was quickly repaired and fired upon the Vicksburg batteries on 19 May and 22 May. During the attack on the 22nd, , , , and Tuscumbia silenced three water batteries and destroyed four guns. Tuscumbia returned to the naval station at Memphis, Tennessee, for repairs in August but was laid up in November. She was repaired at Memphis in May 1864 and was assigned patrol duty between Cairo and the head of the Tennessee River. After further repairs at Mound City, Illinois, in October, she was inactivated in February 1865. Tuscumbia was sold at auction at Mound City to W. K. Adams on 29 November 1865.

Side B from an Attic black-figure neck- amphora, ca. 550‚Äì530 BC. From Vulci. Signed by the Amasis Painter. The Panionium (Ancient Greek Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒπœéŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ, Pani≈çnion) was an Ionian sanctuary dedicated to Poseidon Helikonios and the meeting place of the Ionian League. It was on the peninsula of Mt. Mycale, about south of Smyrna‚Äînow ƒ∞zmir, in Turkey. Herodotus describes it as follows:Herodotus, 1.148. > The Panionion is a sacred ground in Mykale, facing north; it was set apart > for Poseidon of Helicon by the joint will of the Ionians. Mykale is a > western promontory of the mainland opposite Samos; the Ionians used to > assemble there from their cities and keep the festival to which they gave > the name of Panionia. The sanctuary was under the control of the Ionian city of Priene, one of the twelve cities comprising the Ionian League.Strabo, 8.7.2. Priene was about away, on the opposite side of Mt. Mycale. The Prienians managed the sanctuary and presided at the sacrifices and sacred rites. The Panionium was the site of the Ionian religious festival and games (panegyris) called the Panionia. Under Persian rule, activities at the Panionium were curtailed. Writing at the end of the 5th century BC, Thucydides says that the Ionians were then celebrating their festival at Ephesus.Thucydides, 3.104. Diodorus writes that the Ionians were forced to move the Panionia from the Panionium to Ephesus, because of war in the surrounding area.Diodorus, 15.49. Under Alexander the Great the games and festival were again held at the Panionium, and continued to be so under Roman rule, without however, regaining their previous importance.  Location  The approximate location of the Panionium is given by several ancient writers. For example, Herodotus says it is on \\"Mycale facing north\\", and Strabo says it is \\"after the Samian strait, near Mt. Mycale, as one sails to Ephesus‚Ä¶lying three stadia above the sea\\".Strabo, 14.1.20. However the exact location of the site was lost. A potential clue to the Panionium's location was the discovery of an inscription in the area in 1673. Theodor Wiegand discovered a site at the end of the 19th century, and it was excavated in 1958 by Kleiner, Hommel and M√ºller-Wiener. It is located 17 km south of Ku≈üadasƒ±, near G√ºzel√ßamlƒ±, on the north slope of Mt. Mycale, on the top of a low hill called Otomatik Tepe (\\"machine-gun-hill\\"), overlooking the sea. Theatre near G√ºzel√ßamlƒ± Wiegand's site has been for many years identified as the Panionion. It was enclosed by a temenos wall, of which one to three courses can still be seen, with an entrance from the west. In the central area can be seen evidence of a 17.5 m by 4.25 m rectangular stone, presumed to be the altar of Poseidon, dated from the end of the 6th century BC. At the foot of the hill, 50 m southwest of the altar, is a small theatre or odeum. It is 32 m in diameter, a little bit more than semicircular, with 11 rows of seats, cut into solid rock, and is presumed to be the council chamber for the meetings of the Ionian League. It dates from the 4th century BC, when the Ionian League and the Panionia were revived. Between the sanctuary and the council chamber is a large cave, although what if any cult function it may have had is unknown. Ancient sources mention sacrifices,Pausanias, 7.4.10; Strabo 8.7.2; Diodorus 15.49. but no temple, and none has been found. However, in 2004, the German archaeologist Hans Lohmann, surveying the peninsula of Mt. Mycale, discovered another archaeological site high in the mountains, a settlement and an archaic temple (about mid 6th century BC) of the Ionic order. In the summer of 2005, the temple was excavated in cooperation with the Museum of Aydƒ±n. Lohmann assumes that this site, overlooking most of the Ionian region, has to be identified as the Panionion, if only because it agrees better with the written sources.

His seven handbooks on design deeply influenced the look of cities and towns throughout New England until the Civil War. Builders also copied his plans in the Midwest and in the South. Life and work Asher Benjamin was born in rural Hartland, Connecticut,Asher Benjamin, The American Builder's Companion (introduction to the 1969 Dover reprint) shortly after which his father died. The first 30 years of his life would be spent in the Connecticut River Valley. He received his early training from a local builder, and showed an aptitude for architecture by carving Ionic capitals for the 1794 modifications to the Oliver Phelps House at Suffield, Connecticut. In 1795-1796 he designed and built a stone spiral staircase in the Old State House at Hartford, which had been designed by Charles Bulfinch. The latter's use of overall symmetry, blind arches, fanlights and smooth brick greatly influenced Benjamin, who would help spread the urbane Federal style into the countryside. Gideon Granger would write of Benjamin that: :\\"From a poor boy unaided by friends, by his indefatigable industry and talents in a few years he has raised himself to the first rank of his profession.\\" Kenneth Hafertepe, \\"Asher Benjamin Begins; The Samuel and Dorothy Hinckley House\\", Old-Time New England, Spring/Summer 1999, p. 19 He first settled in Greenfield, Massachusetts, where he built two large houses, including the Leavitt House (today's Leavitt-Hovey House) for Judge Jonathan Leavitt, as well as publishing his first handbook, The Country Builder's Assistant (1797). On November 30, 1797, he married Achsah Hitchcock of Brookfield, who bore him four children. Benjamin later moved to Windsor, Vermont, where he built three large houses and the Old South Congregational Church (1798). By 1803, he was in Boston. Listed in the city directory as a housewright, he designed numerous churches and houses. He also appears to have conducted the country's first architecture school, credited with teaching Robert Henry Eddy, Elias Carter, Solomon Willard, Samuel Shepherd and Ithiel Town. After his first wife died on January 30, 1805, on July 24 he married Nancy Bryant of Springfield, who bore him another four children. \\"Mouldings at large,\\" from The American Builder's Companion, 1816 Federal style house, from The Country Builder's Assistant, 1797 In 1823 and 1824, Benjamin was elected alderman of Boston as part of the \\"Middling Interest,\\" a coalition of middle class entrepreneurs and artisans opposed to the Federalists, and who supported Josiah Quincy for mayor. He would help Mayor Quincy and Alexander Parris plan Quincy Market. But his political ambitions were curtailed by financial problems, which led to bankruptcy in 1825. From 1825 to 1827 he left Boston to supervise construction of locks, canals, roads and mill buildings for the Nashua Manufacturing Company in Nashua, New Hampshire. He also designed two churches there before returning to Boston.\\"History of Nashua, NH\\"; City of Nashua, New Hampshire Benjamin's greatest influence, however, is due to his pattern books. They were the first written by an American architect, bringing architectural history, style and geometry to ordinary builders in the field. He adapted many designs by James Gibbs and Colen Campbell of Great Britain to fit the scale and finances of New England communities. These handbooks provided superb drawings and practical advice for full house plans, including such details as circular staircases, doorways, fireplace mantels, dormer windows, pilasters, balusters and fences. He sketched proposals for dwellings and churches, even a courthouse. The archeological sources of his designs were scrupulously cited, from the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens to the Arch of Titus in Rome. Other architects, including Ithiel Town and Ammi B. Young, freely assimilated his plans, as did innumerable carpenters. Indeed, the charm of many early New England towns owes a debt to Asher Benjamin. The Ridge in Orford, New Hampshire features a series of houses based on designs from his books, many of which remain in print.Bryant Franklin Tolles, Carolyn K. Tolles, New Hampshire Architecture; An Illustrated Guide, 1979 And although he helped disseminate the Federal style, he was not averse to changing fashion. In fact, his book published in 1830, The Architect, or, Practical House Carpenter, helped redirect American taste towards the Greek Revival. But as architectural historian Talbot Hamlin writes: :\\"...he, more than any other person is responsible for the character we roughly call 'Late Colonial'; his moldings, his doors and windows and his mantels and cornices decorate or at least inspire the decorations of numberless houses up and down the New England coast and in the New England river valleys.\\" Florence Thompson Howe, \\"More About Asher Benjamin\\", Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 1954, p. 16 Asher Benjamin died in Springfield at the age of 72.

He was elected Senator for Anambra Central Constituency in April 2011. He was the governor of Anambra State in Nigeria from May 2003 to March 2006 under the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Chris Ngige is currently a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Background A medical doctor by profession, Ngige graduated from the University of Nigeria-Nsukka in 1979. Chris immediately went into the civil service, serving at the National Assembly and State House clinics at different times. He retired in 1998 as a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Health. Political career Dr. Chris Nwabueze Ngige joined politics, becoming a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). In 1999, he was Assistant National Secretary and Zonal Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South East region of Nigeria. In 2003, he was elected governor of Anambra State in controversial circumstances. He quickly broke ranks with his political godfather, Chris Uba brother of Andy Uba, after an unsuccessful attempt on 10 July 2003 to have him removed from office, through a fabricated letter of resignation which the state assembly accepted. In August, 2005, an election Tribunal led by Justice Nabaruma nullified Ngige's 2003 victory. He appealed to the Nigerian Federal Court of Appeal, but the annulment was confirmed on 15 March 2006, in a judgment awarding victory to Peter Obi of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). No further appeals were possible, and Ngige accepted the judgment in good faith, calling on the people of Anambra to give their support to his successor. Following Peter Obi's subsequent impeachment, Ngige attempted to participate in state governorship elections in April 2007, but was frustrated by the Independent National Electoral Commission and federal 'disqualification', even after a Federal High Court had voided the disqualification. In the final event, Obi's impeachment was overturned anyway, and Obi served out his four years. At the time, Ngige was also severely criticized for appearing naked at the dreaded Okija voodoo shrine during his campaign to be made governor. On 6 February 2010, Ngige again contested for the governorship of Anambra State. Other notable politicians who contested with him included Andy Uba, Charles Soludo, Nicholas Ukachukwu, Mrs. Uche Ekwunife, Ralph Nwosu, and the incumbent governor, Peter Obi. In all, there were 25 candidates for that election. Peter Obi won that election and started his second term as the governor of Anambra State. In April 2011, Ngige ran for election for Senator of Anambra Central, on the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) platform. After voting problems in some areas of the constituency on 9 April, the election in these areas was held on 25 April and Ngige was declared the winner over former Minister of Information and Communications Professor Dora Akunyili of the APGA, with 69,765 votes to Akunyili's 69,292. Ngige's tenure as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria came to an end following his defeat in the 2015 election by Hon. Mrs Uche Ekwunife who has been sworn in as the Senator representing Anambra Central Senatorial District in the current 8th National Assembly of Nigeria. On 11 November 2015, Ngige was named minister of Labour and Employment by President Muhammadu Buhari. In 2019, Chris Ngige was Nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari as a returning minister for screening by the house of assembly.https://punchng.com/ministerial-nominee-i-left-pdp-when-it- was-not-doing-well-says-ngige/ On 21 August 2019, he was sworn in by the president as the Minister of Labour and Employment See also *List of Governors of Anambra State References  External links  * Official Nuhu Ribadu for President campaign website Category:1952 births Category:Igbo politicians Category:University of Nigeria alumni Category:Living people Category:Governors of Anambra State Category:Buhari administration personnel Category:People's Democratic Party state governors of Nigeria Category:Action Congress of Nigeria politicians Category:Members of the Senate (Nigeria) Category:All Progressives Congress politicians Category:Federal ministers of Nigeria ","title":"Chris Ngige"},{"id":"2351381","text":"The Everett Massacre (also known as Bloody Sunday) was an armed confrontation between local authorities and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) union, commonly called \\"Wobblies\\". It took place in Everett, Washington on Sunday, November 5, 1916. The event marked a time of rising tensions in Pacific Northwest labor history. Background In 1916, Everett, Washington was facing a serious depression. There was ongoing confrontation between business, commercial interests, labor, and labor organizers. There had been a number of labor-organized rallies and speeches in the street. These were opposed by local law enforcement, which was firmly on the side of business. IWW organizers had gone into Everett to support a five-month-long strike by shingle workers. Once there, vigilantes organized by business had beaten them up with axe handles and run them out of town. The Seattle IWW decided to go to Everett in numbers to hold a rally to show their support for the striking shingle workers.Newell, Gordon R., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 263-64, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Confrontation at the dock On November 5, 1916, about 300 IWW members met at the IWW Hall in Seattle and then marched down to the docks where they boarded the steamers Verona and Calista which then headed north to Everett. Verona arrived at Everett before Callista and as they approached the dock in the early afternoon, the Wobblies sang their fight song Hold the Fort. Local business interests, knowing the Wobblies were coming, placed armed goon squads on the dock and on at least one tugboat in the harbor, Edison, owned by the American Tug Boat Company.McCurdy, at 263 As with previous labor demonstrations, the local businessmen had also secured the aid of law enforcement, including the Snohomish County sheriff Donald McRae, who was known for targeting Wobblies for arbitrary arrests and beatings.Clark, Norman H., Mill Town -- A social history of Everett, Washington, at 186-87, University of Washington Press, Seattle, WA 1970 Shootout More than 200 vigilantes or \\"citizen deputies\\", under the ostensible authority of Snohomish County Sheriff McRae, met in order to repel the \\"anarchists.\\" As the Verona drew into the dock, and someone on board threw a line over a bollard, McRae stepped forward and called out \\"Boys, who's your leader?\\" The IWW men laughed and jeered, replying \\"We're all leaders,\\" and they started to swing out the gang plank. McRae drew his pistol, told them he was the sheriff, he was enforcing the law, and they couldn't land here. There was a silence, then a Wobbly came up to the front and yelled out \\"the hell we can't.\\"Clark, at 205 Just then a single shot rang out, followed by about ten minutes of intense gunfire. Most of it came from the vigilantes on the dock, but some fire came from the Verona, although the majority of the passengers were unarmed.McCurdy, at 264 Whether the first shot came from boat or dock was never determined. Passengers aboard the Verona rushed to the opposite side of the ship, nearly capsizing the vessel. The ship's rail broke as a result and a number of passengers were ejected into the water, some drowned as a result but how many is not known, or whether persons who'd been shot also went overboard.Clark, at 205-206 Over 175 bullets pierced the pilot house alone, and the captain of the Verona, Chance Wiman, was only able to avoid being shot by ducking behind the ship's safe. Once the ship righted herself somewhat after the near-capsize, some slack came on the bowline, and Engineer Shellgren put the engines hard astern, parting the line, and enabling the steamer to escape. Out in the harbor, Captain Wiman warned off the approaching Calista and then raced back to Seattle. Death toll The Seattle Star, November 6, 1916, Front Page At the end of the mayhem, two citizen deputiesODMP memorials for Deputies Beard and Curtis lay dead with 16 or 20 others wounded, including Sheriff McRae. The two businessman-deputies that were shot were actually shot in the back by fellow deputies; their injuries were not caused by Wobbly gunfire.John McClelland Jr., Wobbly War: The Centralia Story (Tacoma: Washington State Historical Society, 1987)Lowell S. Hawley and Ralph Bushnell Potts, Counsel for the Damned (New York: Lippincott, 1953). The IWW officially listed 5 deadThe Tacoma Times, Nov. 6, 1916, page 1, also reported 20 IWW and 20 Everett citizens were wounded. with 27 wounded, although it is speculated that as many as 12 IWW members may have been killed. There was a good likelihood that at least some of the casualties on the dock were caused not by IWW firing from the steamer, but on vigilante rounds from the cross-fire of bullets coming from the Edison.Clark, at 206 The local Everett Wobblies started their street rally anyway, and as a result, McRae's deputized citizens rounded them up and hauled them off to jail.Clark, at 207 As a result of the shootings, Governor Ernest Lister of the State of Washington sent companies of militia to Everett and Seattle to help maintain order. Question of violence There have been many efforts to find the IWW, a self-described radical union, at fault for the violence. Other historians have placed blame on external forces, including that a private detective working as a labor spy had advocated violent action at an IWW meeting in Everett. Aftermath Upon returning to Seattle, 74 Wobblies were arrested as a direct result of the \\"Everett Massacre\\" including IWW leader Thomas H. Tracy. They were taken to the Snohomish County jail in Everett and charged with murder of the two deputies. After a two-month trial, Tracy was acquitted by a jury on May 5, 1917. Shortly thereafter, all charges were dropped against the remaining 73 defendants and they were released from jail.

Williams (May 4, 1782 - October 20, 1854) was an American soldier, merchant, and politician who is most well known for serving as the first mayor of Detroit, Michigan, after the city‚Äôs reincorporation. In total, he served as Detroit's mayor for five other terms. He also was a brigadier general in the United States Army during the Black Hawk War. Early life and education Born in Detroit, he was baptized as John Williams (he later adopted the ‚ÄòR‚Äô in his name to distinguish himself from another John Williams who was living in Detroit at the time). His parents were Thomas Williams and Cecile Campeau, of Detroit's Campau family. His father, who had been active in civic and political affairs, died before December 12, 1785, at which time Joseph Campeau (which he generally spelled Campau) leased a house to Cecile (widow of Thomas Williams) that was located north of the Detroit River and adjacent to Joseph Campau's property. His mother married Jaques Leson in 1790 and lived in what is now St. Clair County, Michigan. Cecile died on June 24, 1805 and was buried in the St. Anne's church cemetery. Raised in his mother's French Canadian community, he spoke and wrote fluently in both French and English. Personal life Williams married Mary Mott, one of his cousins, in 1804. She was the daughter of Gershom Mott, who served during the Revolutionary War, and Elizabeth Williams, who was the sister of Thomas Williams from Albany. The couple had ten children together. One of them, Union General Thomas Williams, was killed in action during the Civil War at the Battle of Baton Rouge (1862). Career =Military and business career= Williams served in the Territorial Militia from 1796 to 1799 at Fort Marsac in Tennessee. Upon leaving the army, he returned to Detroit and joined his uncle, Joseph Campau, in his successful mercantile business. During the War of 1812, Williams again served in the militia, this time as the captain of an artillery company. =Political life= After the end of the war, Williams was appointed Associate Justice of the County Court for Michigan in 1815. He went on to serve as a County Commissioner and Adjutant General of the Territory, and at his death was the senior Major General of the state militia. In 1824, Williams wrote the City Charter and served as the first official mayor of the City of Detroit. He was also elected and served as the fourth and thirteenth mayor in 1830 and 1844-1846, respectively. Besides serving as mayor, Williams was a landowner, merchant, and bank president during his lifetime. He served as one of the first trustees of the University of Michigan, was president of the Detroit Board of Education, and was a delegate to the first Michigan Constitutional Convention. In 1831, Willams and Joseph Campau started the Democratic Free Press newspaper, which became the Detroit Free Press.http://michigannewspaperhistory.pbworks.com/w/page/42160960/Detroit%201809-1899 Mary died on January 18, 1830. Williams died at the age of seventy-two on October 20, 1854. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. Today, a street in metropolitan Detroit bears his name. \\"John R\\" Street was named while John R. Williams was still living, which is atypical to the way most roads obtain their name.

Ice skaters in winter Kungstr√§dg√•rden (Swedish for \\"King's Garden\\") is a park in central Stockholm, Sweden. It is colloquially known as Kungsan. The park's central location and its outdoor caf√©s makes it one of the most popular hangouts and meeting places in Stockholm. It also hosts open-air concerts and events in summer, while offering an ice rink, Opening hours and some more information. during winters. There is also a number of caf√©s, art galleries and restaurants; for example Galleri Doktor Glas, a name taken from the novel Doctor Glas by Hjalmar S√∂derberg published in 1905. The park is divided into four distinct spaces (south to north): (1) Square of Charles XII; (2) Molin's Fountain; (3); Square of Charles XIII and (4) \\"Fountain of Wolodarski\\" (which does not have an official name). The park is administered and events in it organized by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.  Overview  Art at the metro station Kungstr√§dg√•rden A number of Stockholm landmarks are found around the perimeter of Kungstr√§dg√•rden: South of the park is the quay Str√∂mgatan interconnecting the bridges Str√∂mbron and Norrbro, both of which stretches over to the Stockholm Old Town and the Royal Palace. North of the park is Hamngatan with the department stores PK-huset and Nordiska Kompaniet (NK) facing the park. Kungstr√§dg√•rdsgatan stretches along the park's eastern side. A series of prominent buildings are lined-up along it: Stockholm Synagogue by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, 1867‚Äì70,Guide, M√•rtelius, p 22.

Postcard of Kungstr√§dg√•rden around 1890‚Äì1900 Though the royal kitchen garden is known to date back to the Middle Ages, it is first mentioned in historical records as konungens k√•lg√•rd (\\"king's cabbage garden\\") in 1430. (See also Tr√§dg√•rdsgatan.) The royal property in the area was considerably enlarged through an acquisition in 1454 and further expanded throughout the following century. This utilitarian garden was gradually transformed into an enclosed royal Baroque pleasure garden and accordingly referred to as \\"King's Garden\\"The garden is referred to as H:K: M:ttz Tr√§g√•rdh, Konnungz Tr√§g√•rdhen, Konungens Treg√•rdh, and Kongl. Tr√§g√•rdhen throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. King Charles XI calls it Kongs- Tr√§gordhen during the 1690s. throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The garden was a symmetrical composition centred on a fountain and separated from the waterfront by the Makal√∂s Palace (\\"Peerless\\").Stockholms gatunamn, p 175.Guide till Stockholms arkitektur, M√•rtelius, p 12. However, the demolition of the walls began in the early 19th century, and for the inauguration of the statue of Charles XIII in 1821, his successor Charles XIV John had most of the garden replaced by a gravelled open space ordered to be named \\"Square of Charles XIII\\". When Makal√∂s was destroyed by fire in 1825 the park was extended south down to the waterfront. Notwithstanding the area became a popular spot for bourgeois social life and military drilling, Charles XIV's initiative never was appreciated, and in the 1860s the space was subsequently furnished with the tree-lined avenues still giving the park its character and through which the old name prevailed. In addition, the park's showpiece, the tall and elaborate Molin's Fountain, was cast in bronze and given a space in the park. The following century saw several proposals to have the northern section of the park replaced by various buildings, but during WWII a contract determined the area should remain a park and in 1970 it finally became the property of the city. In the 1970s, construction of the metro station caused much controversy since the plans called for the old elms to be cut down, which led to violent protests and a tree-hugger campaign on May 12-May 13, 1971 with people chaining themselves to the trees, the so-called Battle of the Elms. Eventually these protests not only saved the trees and caused the station entrances to be located east and west of the park, but they also marked the end of a period when many old buildings in central Stockholm were demolished.Wahlgren, pp 20‚Äì23. The park had a reputation for rioting youth, prostitution, and drug dealing in the 1980s. Extreme-right demonstrations in the 1990s by the statue of Charles XII altered its reputation. It was redesigned in the late 1990s to it present shape. In 2004, 285 new linden trees were planted to replace the sick elms (of which some dated back to the 17th century) and new pavilions with caf√©s were added.  Squares of both Charles  Statue of Charles XII Statue of Charles XIII The southern third of the park. called Karl XII:s torg (\\"Charles XII's Square\\") is centred on the statue of Charles XII by Johan Peter Molin, inaugurated for the 150th anniversary of the king's death on November 30, 1868. The square, until then forming a section of the levelled park carrying the name of Charles XIII, was subsequently renamed after Charles XII and transformed into more of a park than a square.Wrangel, Stockholmiana I‚ÄìIV, p 171. The park is centred on the statue of Charles XIII, King of Sweden from 1809 until his death in 1818, commissioned by his successor Charles XIV John. The Neoclassicist composition of Gustaf G√∂the (1779‚Äì1838), inaugurated in 1821, is escorted by four lions sculpted by Bengt Erland Fogelberg (1786‚Äì1854), added in 1824, and each of which are holding a ball carrying the Norwegian and Swedish coat of arms alluding the Swedish-Norwegian Union initiated by the king. The anchor under the king's right arm reminds us of his great naval victories during the Russo- Swedish War 1788-1790.Statens Fastighetsverk Now, Stockholmers were widely displeased with Charles XIII and therefore referred to the statue as \\"a gardener without a garden just as a king without honour\\" and, as Charles XII is surrounded by four backs from mortars, in Swedish called kruka (\\"pot\\") and Charles XIII is flanked by four lions, again popular humour used the opportunity to throw some dirt at the latter by referring to both statues as \\"a lion among pots and a pot among lions\\". On the location for the statue of Charles XII was the palace Makal√∂s (\\"Peerless\\"), owned by the Constable of the Realm and Count of L√§ck√∂ Jakob De la Gardie and completed in 1642. The palace was transferred to the Crown under King Charles XI and rebuilt into an armoury in 1690. Following the death of Gustav III in 1792 the palace was rebuilt into an opera house. The opera house burned to the ground during a performance in 1825, fragments from it today exhibited in the nearby metro station. Since the exposition of 1866, the western part of the square, named Lagerlunden (\\"The Laurel Grove\\"), is renowned for the exclusive dining-rooms of the rebuilt opera house.Stugart, DN, 2005-10-19Stockholms gatunamn, p 163. In the early 1970s, this was the location for the Battle of the Elms (Slaget om almarna), protests which ended the demolition of central portions of Stockholm. In the 1990s, the square was made a popular gathering spot for right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis usually holding parades on November 30 every year. Occasionally, this has resulted in clashes with left wing protesters and real battles have taken place in Kungstr√§dg√•rden. Today it is mostly known for the so-called Tehuset (\\"Tea House\\") offering coffee, sandwiches, and other refreshing things.  Fountain of Molin  { align=\\"right\\" width=\\"301\\"  Fountain by J. P. Molin, 1866  Nix playing his harp } The fountain of Johan Peter Molin, originally carved in plaster, was the centrepiece of a Scandinavian art and industry exposition in 1866. While the exposition's main building, stretching 200 metres across the park and crowned by a dome 30 metres wide, was over- crowded with objects, it failed to attract an audience. The fountain was, however, appreciated to the extent a subscription was raised to have it cast in bronze, and was subsequently inaugurated in 1873 on the same location.Wiberg The mythological characters inhabiting the fountain are the ocean god √Ügir and his wife R√°n with their nine daughters, all listening to the river spirit Nix playing his harp. It symbolizes Stockholm located between the upper bowl, Lake M√§laren, and the lower basin, the Baltic Sea. The six swans, still offering fresh water to passers-by, were late additions, the artist condescending the audience's apprehension of the sculpture as mere luxuriousness. Explore Stockholm For the inauguration of the fountain, willow trees were planted in the park. These are a hybrid of the willow species Peking Willow (Salix babylonica), in English known as Thurlow Weeping Willow (Salix pendulina elegantissima) but in Swedish given the name font√§npil (\\"fountain willow\\") in recognition to still the admired artwork. As one of thirteen objects selected for a project 1999‚Äì2006 to decorate prominent buildings and milieus in Stockholm with fiber optics, the fountain was furnished with a score of light sources accentuating the sculptures and cascades of water, toppled by a laterally emitting cable in the upper bowl.City of Stockholm, Nattljus  Fountain of Wolodarski  The park in 2007 In August 1998, a total number of 63 Sakura trees (\\"Japanese cherry\\") were planted; each spring when they all blossom is an experience of beauty and scent in the park. Additionally, city architect Alexander Wolodarski commissioned artist Sivert Lindblom to design the large bronze urns now lined up along the new rectangular fountain. Lindblom has also furnished the small square Blasieholmstorg just east of the park with Byzantine horses. Wolodarski's renewal of the park has been met with protest focusing on the \\"Baroque\\" scale and geometry of his design. Others have been critical about the park being \\"handed over\\" to an entrepreneur ‚Äì for example,Hallemar the head of the city's garden department was upset nothing much remains of the park, notwithstanding the park was even reshaped into a golf course to suit a Mercedez-Benz campaign.

Internal combustion engines, and in particular all current automobile engines, do not generally have piston rods. Instead they use trunk pistons, where the piston and crosshead are combined and so do not need a rod between them. The term piston rod has been used as a synonym for 'connecting rod' in the context of these engines. Engines with crossheads have piston rods. These include most steam locomotives and some large marine diesel engines.  Steam engines  Stationary steam engine from Swannington Incline. Note the tail rod and secondary crosshead The first single-acting beam engines, such as Newcomen's, had a single power stroke acting downwards. Rather than a piston rod, they used an iron chain. This could transmit a tensile force, but not a compression force pushing upwards. The piston was sealed in the cylinder around its rim but the top of the cylinder was open. A rudimentary piston rod was used, simply to reduce the cost of a long forged chain. Watt's development of the steam engine introduced an enclosed upper cylinder. This now required a stuffing box to seal around the piston rod, and for the piston rod to be machined smooth and accurately cylindrical. The engines were still single-acting at this time and the rod was still only acting in tension. Later developments, also by Watt, produced a double-acting cylinder. The piston rod now had to transmit a force alternately pushing and pulling. The steam engine's general use of an enclosed cylinder, nearly always double-acting, made it dependent on the stuffing box and so the piston rod. = Attachment = Piston rods are usually attached to the crosshead and the piston by a transverse slot and a tapered key or gib. Driving this key sideways tightens the attachment. Using a transverse key allows relatively easy dismantling for maintenance. Some smaller pistons are retained by a threaded piston rod and a large nut, although the crosshead nearly always uses a key. As the precise length of the piston rod is important for timing the engine's valvegear, the attachment tightens the piston down onto a fixed step or location in the piston rod and the length (and valve timing) is not adjustable. This length requires the precision of the manufactured rod but, unlike the rod driving the valves, does not need to be adjusted even more precisely by a fitter during the engine's erection. = Tail rods = Early steam engineers were convinced that horizontal cylinders would suffer excessive wear, owing to the weight of the piston riding on the bore of the cylinder. Vertical cylinders remained a favourite for some years. When horizontal cylinders were adopted, one measure used to carry the piston weight was to have an extended or second piston rod on the other side of the piston. This emerged through a second stuffing box and in rare cases (illus.) was supported by a second crosshead. Enclosing the entire tail rod in a sealed casing avoided the need for a stuffing box and any leakage of steam. However this also gave a risk that condensed water could accumulate in the casing, leading to hydraulic lock and mechanical damage. = Trunk engines = Trunk engines were compact steam engines, developed for the propulsion of ships. They reduced their overall length by placing the crosshead alongside the piston in the form of a hollow tubular trunk. There was thus no longer any need for a piston rod. The connecting rod and its gudgeon pin were mounted inside this trunk. Trunk engines had extremely large diameter pistons and so the old issue of supporting piston weight and avoiding cylinder wear was again a concern. Trunk engines used a second trunk as a tail rod to support their large pistons. = Single-acting steam engines = Some late steam engines, mostly high-speed steam engines, were also single acting. These also used trunk pistons, but in a new form. These engines were vertical and used a simple piston design, with no separate trunk but using the sides of an elongated piston as the crosshead bearing surface. This trunk piston design would become almost universal for internal combustion engines.  Steam locomotives  Small steam locomotive, with piston rod visible between the cylinder (green, left) and the crosshead (right). Note the small brass lubricator (the leftmost), whose function is to lubricate the piston rod and stuffing box, through a short oil pipe Almost all steam locomotives have used a similar design of cylinder, with a crosshead slide mounted adjacent to the cylinder and a short piston rod between them. class 252.0 locomotive, with a tail rod In some cases, tail rods were also used. These were rare in the United Kingdom, but relatively common in Europe, at least for large locomotives.  Diesel engines  Large diesel engines, crosshead type on the left, with piston rod (9) and trunk piston type on the right. Internal combustion (piston) engines operate at higher speeds than steam engines. They thus benefit from reduced reciprocating mass and from a shorter, stiffer linkage between the piston and the connecting rod. Double-acting engines are also very rare, although these did use piston rods. The high-speed steam engine's lightweight trunk piston was thus soon adopted and remains in service today. Its major changes have been in its sealing rings and the adoption of aluminium alloys to make the pistons lighter. Some large slow-speed Diesel engines, particularly those for ships, use crossheads and piston rods. Medium- and high-speed diesel engines operate at faster speeds and so use lighter- weight trunk pistons.

They are major pests to agricultural crops, mainly fruits such as apples and pears. Because the larvae are not able to feed on leaves, they are highly dependent on fruits as a food source and thus have a significant impact on crops. The caterpillars bore into fruit and stop it from growing, which leads to premature ripening. Various means of control, including chemical, biological, and preventive, have been implemented. This moth has a widespread distribution, being found on six continents. Adaptive behavior such as diapause and multiple generations per breeding season have allowed this moth to persist even during years of bad climatic conditions. Cydia pomonella illustration by Des Helmore  Geographic distribution  Although the geographic origin of codling moths is unclear, there are theories of these moths originating from either Europe or the Mediterranean. Scholars believe that the codling moths were introduced to the Americas in the mid-1700s. There is still debate on whether or not these moths have been distributed by humans. Today, the codling moths are spread all over the world, ranging from Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America, Australia, and islands in the Pacific.  Habitat  Viability and fitness of the codling moths are highly dependent on humidity levels and climate. Under observation, the optimal conditions for moth growth and survival were 32 ¬∞C and 75% humidity. Even if the temperature is favorable, low and high levels of relative humidity (20% and 100% respectively) led to hindrance in pupation. At a temperature below 0 ¬∞C, the larvae become completely inactive and turn seemingly lifeless. However, researchers observed that if the temperature is returned to optimal levels, the larvae regained normal activity. Codling moths have been located at altitudes as high as 1000‚Äì1500 m. Because the codling moth is polyphagous, or able to utilize a variety of food sources, the availability of specific food resources does not determine their optimal habitat. Various stages of the moth's life history, from eggs to pupae, can be found on host plants which the larvae feed on. These plants include apple, pear, walnut, chestnut, and even apricot trees.  Morphology  Adult Codling moths are not large, as the full grown adult codling moth has an average length of 10 mm and wingspan of 20 mm. The wings fold into a tent-like shape when the moths are resting. They are distinguished from other similar moths in the family Tortricidae by the distinctive patterns on their fore-wings. These brown spots enclosed in gold rings are called \\"little mirrors\\" because they resemble small mirrors with a golden rim. The slender antennae are mildly curved near the distal end. The dorsal side of the abdomen is smooth and bare, while the ventral side is covered in scales. Though most of the moths are brown or gray in color, it has been observed that the maturity of the fruits the larvae feed on can lead to variation in color in the adult moth.  Food resources  = Caterpillar =  Feeding behavior  The codling moth caterpillars bore into a fruit within 24 hours of hatching from their eggs, usually traveling between 1.5 m to 3 m in search of a fruit. Because they are susceptible to predation, drying up, or being washed away between the period of hatching and boring into a fruit, the caterpillars are prompt in finding a fruit to feed on. Although apples are their dominant food source, they are polyphagous, feeding on a wide variety of fruits from pear, walnut, apricot, peaches, plums, cherries, and chestnuts. They are unable to survive by feeding on leaves of the fruit trees. It was previously believed that the searching behavior of the caterpillar for fruit to feed on or for a pupation site was random. However, the caterpillar is exposed and susceptible to predation, parasitization, drying up, and even energy depletion during this searching period. Thus, it was hypothesized that the searching behavior uses thigmotactic sense, which means the caterpillars use contact reflex to search. Caterpillars also use phototaxis to locate fruits to feed on. They are photopositive, which means they move towards light. This is adaptive because fruits tend to be located at the ends of the branches where there is most sunlight. Therefore, by following light, the larvae are able to move closer to fruits. Larva in apple fruit Once the caterpillar has located a fruit to feed on, it starts penetrating the epidermis of the fruit. As the caterpillar makes way into the fruit, scraps of the skin, pulp, and frass build up near the entrance of the hole. These pieces are glued together by silk threads released from the caterpillar to create a cap. This cap protects the caterpillar by blocking the entrance. It takes the caterpillar approximately 45 minutes to bore into the fruit and about 15 minutes to cap. The caterpillar bores through the fruit until it reaches the seminal chamber of the fruit. There, the caterpillar bites into the seeds and halts the growth of the fruit. The fruit ripens prematurely as a result. By doing so, the caterpillar gains beneficial resources, such as albumin and fat. Such feeding behavior lasts for 23 to 27 days and the caterpillar feeds on an average of one to two fruits during this time.  Host plant deterrents to herbivory  Fruits attacked by the codling moth caterpillars have developed methods of resisting the caterpillars. Methods of resistance include thickening of the epidermis of the fruit and using stony cells to protect the seed. Fuzziness of the fruit has also been observed to deter codling moth caterpillars. Stony cells, which are present in some pears, have shown to help in resisting codling moth caterpillars. Stony cells are found in the endocarp of fruits such as cherries or walnuts. The endocarp is the innermost layer of a fruit's pericarp. In pears, stone cells are found in groups of cells found in the fruit pulp. These cells are found to have thick cell walls, reaching up to 10 ¬µm. At maturity, these cells are composed out of 30% cellulose, 30% glucuronoxylans, and 40% lignins, which are biopolymers that are commonly found in plants. = Adult = Adult moths feed little if at all. Though feeding may prolong life a little longer, abstaining from feeding does not significantly reduce their reproductive success. Their ability to copulate and oviposit are unaffected, and embryonic development in eggs is not affected by lack of feeding behavior of the parent moths. If they choose to feed, the moths feed on sweet fluids, such as juice from the fruit, diluted honey, and diluted molasses.  Reproduction and life history  = Number of generations = There are usually two generations of moths in a given flight period (summer months). In the northern hemisphere, first generation moths emerge in July and are active through August. Eggs laid by the first generation moths are called second generation. These eggs hatch and the caterpillar undergoes pupation. The pupae go into diapause and \\"hibernate\\" over the winter. In April and May of the following year, these second generation pupae eclose and the second generation moths are active during the months of May and June. Depending on the climatic conditions, the number of generations varies in a year. The number of generations is higher closer to the equator in the Northern hemisphere, which indicates that warmer climate is optimal for higher number of generations. In Denmark, for example, only one generation was observed; in Palestine, four to five generations have been noted. = Mating = Males fly upward near the top of the trees to search for females because females tend to stay near trees that they eclosed from. Codlemones, or (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol, is a major male-attracting sex pheromone secreted by females. Plant volatiles create a synergistic effect with the codlemone, which increases the degree of male attraction. These volatiles include racemic linalool, (E)-Œ≤-farnesene, or (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. The optimal ratio at which attraction is maximized is at a 1:100 ratio of codlemone to synergistic plant volatiles. Pear-derived kairomone has been found to be a species-specific attractant as well. Ethyl (2E, 4Z)-2,4-decadienoate, which is found in ripe pears and is a minor volatile secreted from ripe apples, attracts both mated and virgin males and females. Codling moths can copulate as early as the day of their eclosion, as long as the climate is appropriate. Males have developed hooks near the end of the abdomen, which are used to grasp onto the female during copulation. Because these hooks hold onto the female tightly, copulation that lasts up to several hours has been observed. Copulation occurs within 24 hours of eclosion. = Oviposition = Oviposition occurs at a location where an optimal climate and humidity for growth is met. It has been shown that 75% humidity is optimal for oviposition, and females are more likely to oviposit in the presence of water, fresh fruits, or even molasses. Female fecundity depends greatly on the climate. If the temperature is too low, oviposition is suspended. If the temperature is too high, the female may become sterile. Females do not travel far to oviposit, and generally lay eggs near the tree from which they emerged. On average, the female lays 50‚Äì60 eggs, but this number may vary. She can lay as few as ten eggs or as many as over 100 eggs. First generation eggs are laid on fruits, and second generation eggs are generally oviposited on twigs and leaves. Females favor laying eggs at the upper part of the tree near the edges of the branches, where fruits are most commonly located. The eggs are laid along with sticky mass secreted from the female, which acts as glue to hold the eggs in place and prevent them from being washed away by rain. = Life history stages =  Egg  The eggs, which are oviposited on either the fruit or twig depending on the generation, are white and shaped like a convex lens. They are tiny, usually about 1‚Äì1.2 mm in size. As the caterpillar develops inside the egg, the egg changes color. A reddish ring forms first and then a red spot appears, which becomes the head of the caterpillar. It typically takes about 7 to 12 days for the eggs to hatch, but under optimal conditions, they can hatch in as soon as 5 days.  Caterpillar  Caterpillar larva When the caterpillar first hatches from the egg, it is about 2 mm long and 0.5 mm in diameter. The body is divided up into twelve segments, and the color is usually pale yellow. As the caterpillar undergoes development through five instar phases, it grows to become 18‚Äì20 mm long and more reddish in color. By the time the caterpillars are fully grown, they are light brown in color and have dark brown spots. The sex of the moth is determined during the larval stage. The karyotype of codling moths has shown a diploid system (2n=56), which means the offspring receives two sets of chromosome, one from each parent. Females have a WZ sex chromosome system, while males have ZZ. Males have two brown spots near the end of the dorsal side, which become the gonads. The eggs can hatch at night or day, depending on humidity. Because direct sunlight can dry up the caterpillar and increases the temperature, the caterpillar moves into a shade or crawls to the bottom of the leaf if it hatches during the day. The eggs are glued onto the leaf by the sticky substance secreted by the female, but the caterpillars are small and light enough to be washed away by rain or blown off the tree by wind. Especially because the caterpillars are so small when they first emerge from the egg, they are more susceptible to rainy summers, and data have shown that crops were attacked less by the moths in rainy summers. Pupa  Pupa  The pupae are 10‚Äì12 mm long and can be as wide as 3 mm. The color changes as time passes, from the brown color of the caterpillar to light brown. The pupa's morphology varies with both sex and generation. Female pupae are generally longer and wider than the male pupae. First generation caterpillars secrete smoother and more delicate silk, and thus the cocoon is covered with finer material. Second generation cocoons are coarser and have shreds of wood barks. That is because second generation caterpillars bore out the bark of the tree to create itself a cradle. The fifth instar caterpillar seeks for a place to spin the cocoon near the ground. Using its spider-like silk threads, the larva lowers down to the ground from the branches. They can also crawl down the trunk of the tree. The process of searching for an appropriate place to pupate is long and selective. Pupae have been spotted in various places, such as under old bark, cracks, dry places in the earth, ditches dug into ground, storehouse with the fruit, trunk, under rocks, and between clods of soil. For first generation caterpillars, pupation lasts a shorter period of time, usually less than ten days. For the second generation, the duration of pupation is longer at around 20 days. The difference in pupation duration between first and second generation pupae is due to temperature change as the season progresses. There is a relationship between temperature and duration of pupation: warmer temperatures have been found to shorten the duration. Therefore, first generation caterpillars, which emerge in the warmer months of summer, tend to have a shorter pupation duration. Some second generation caterpillars pupate over winter and in the spring emerge as first generation moths. The cocoon provides sufficient protection from rain and other external factors, except mechanical ones.  Adult  Second generation adult moths first emerge in the spring, around the end of April to beginning of May. Flight time and emergence are dependent on temperature and other climatic factors. As soon as the moths emerge, they copulate, oviposit first generation eggs, and caterpillars that arise from the eggs bore into the fruits. Therefore, it is critical to predict the time of emergence of the moths in the spring to minimize damages to the crops. Segments of the moth abdomen have sharp notches that can make it easier for the moth to emerge from the cocoon. The notches can be used to cut through the exterior cover of the pupa. When the moths first eclose, or emerge as adults, their wings are not spread out completely. Thus they are not capable of flight immediately after eclosion. It takes about ten minutes for the wings to spread completely. The average life span of the moth is around 13 to 18 days. However, the longest living male observed lived for 38 days, and the oldest female lived for 37 days. = Diapause = Diapause, or a period of suspended development, occurs in codling moth caterpillars if the climatic conditions or food availability are unfavorable. Larvae in diapause do not spin cocoons but rather enter a stage of decreased metabolism and vital activity. Once the temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius, the caterpillar turns lifeless and becomes a blob of mush. The caterpillar becomes so soft that if poked, the place where it is poked will remain caved in, as if it is made out of heated wax or clay. For first generation larvae, a greater percentage of the caterpillars entered diapause if they did not pupate by the end of June or beginning of July. Second generation diapause is generally to pass through the winter. Inactivity over the winter is caused by a drop in temperature, and once the temperature and humidity rise back up to a favorable range, activity is resumed. This explains how codling moths are able to survive even if a bad, sterile apple year occurs: the larvae enter diapause and emerge after the bad year has passed. The possibility of a two-year diapause has been debated in the literature for several years. However, the possibility of two-year diapause is slim because none of the caterpillars out of 15,000 cocoons observed emerged after a diapause that lasted two years.  Local dispersion  Flight of the adult codling moths starts near the beginning of May with the eclosion of second generation moths and stops around the end of August as the first generation moths reach senescence every year. The first and second generation flight period overlap anywhere from 10 to 20 days. Overlap of second and first generation moth flight period means there will be continuous damage done by the codling moth during the summer months. Adult moths are generally sedentary and tend to spend the day resting on leaves or branches. Such limited mobility is not because they are incapable of long-distance flight; they have the capacity to travel up to several kilometers. However, the majority of the moths travel between 60 and 800m. Only about 10% of the population are long- distance travelers. Such wide range of flight behavior is an adaptive characteristic; their habitat is usually determined by the availability of the fruit, so there is normally no need to travel far, but if the fruits are spread out in a patchy manner, the moths are capable of traveling longer distances to find food and re-colonize. Virgin females and males have been shown to be more likely to fly longer distances, with both sexes being able to travel about the same distance. Virgin and mated males and virgin females were able to fly the longest during the first third of adulthood, while mated females reached their maximum potential of flight within 1‚Äì3 days after eclosion. High genetic correlation (0.84 to 1.00) was found between total distance traveled and flight traits, such as flight duration and velocity. Flight characteristics are shown to be heritable for both sexes. Selection for and against genes that increase flight traits showed rapid changes in flight traits in both directions. There is, however, a trade-off between mobility and fitness. Research has shown that sedentary females have higher fecundity, or the ability to produce offspring, than mobile females. Sedentary females are larger in size, lay more eggs, and live longer than mobile females. Thus, there is higher reproductive rate in sedentary females. This explains why females do not travel far from the fruit tree from which they emerged to oviposit.  Predators, parasites, and diseases  = Predators = Predators of the codling moth are mostly birds, accounting for nearly 80% of caterpillar killings. Woodpeckers are especially significant predators because they find caterpillars from hidden crevices beneath the bark and branches of host trees. They are also highly preyed upon by arthropods from the following taxonomic groups Araneae (spiders), Opiliones (harvestman), Carabidae (ground beetle), Cicindellidae (tiger beetle which is a kind of ground beetle), Dermaptera (earwig), Formicidae (ant), Geocoridae (big-eyed bugs), Staphylinidae (rove beetle), and Coleoptera (other beetles). Ants are among the most significant of the insect predators because they are numerous and are active in masses. They attack all the stages of the codling moth life cycle, including the caterpillar, pupae, cocoons, and eclosing moths. Some of the commonly known ant predators include Solenopsis molesta, Lasius niger, Formica fusca, Formica pallidefulva schauffussi inserta, Aphaenogaster fulva aquia, Tetramorium caespitum, and Monomorium minimum. Solenopsis molesta can kill 90% of caterpillars they attack, which are usually those moving between fruits or fifth instar caterpillars looking for a pupation site. Thrips are also predators of various life stages of the codling moth. Haplothrips faurei feeds on eggs from all generations, while Leptothrips mali feeds on second generation eggs. = Parasitoids = The egg stage is the most vulnerable period for parasitism because it is when the moth is exposed the longest. Caterpillars are protected by the fruit and the pupae are protected by the cocoon. Insect parasitoids are listed below, with the parasitized life stage of the codling moth indicated in parentheses: * Arrhinomya tragica (pupa) ‚Äì a fly * Neoplectops veniseta (pupa) ‚Äì a Tachinid fly * Ephialtes extensor (caterpillar) ‚Äì an Ichneumonidae wasp that attacks both generations and overwinters in the body of second generation caterpillar * Hyssopus pallidus (larva) ‚Äì these wasps follow the kairomone formed in the frass as the caterpillar bores into the fruit. * Lissonota culiciformis ‚Äì an Ichneumonidae wasp * Mastrus ridens ‚Äì another Ichneumon * Pimpla examinator (caterpillar and pupa) ‚Äì another Ichneumon * Pristomerus vulnerator (caterpillar) ‚Äì another Ichneumon that attacks both generations * Trichomma enecator (caterpillar) ‚Äì another Ichneumon * Ascogaster nov. sp. (egg or pupa) ‚Äì another Ichneumon. A parasitised pupa may die or eclose as a stunted adult. Perilampus tristis, a Chalcidoid wasp, is a hyperparasite of this Ascogaster species. = Pathogens =  Fungi  Beauveria bassiana is a parasite to the caterpillar and pupae of the codling moth. The spores of this snowy white fungus are dispersed in locations where the caterpillars pass by or where they pupate. The mycelium of B. bassiana grows radially out from the body of the caterpillar, turning the caterpillar soft and mushy. It has a killing rate of 13.1% in caterpillars. B. bassiana grows favorably in humid and warm environments. Hirsutella subulata is another entomophagous, or insect-eating, fungal parasite to the codling moth larvae. Unlike B. bassiana, this fungus type can grow even if the humidity is low.  Bacteria  Known bacteria that parasitize the codling moth are Erwinia amylovora and Bacillus cereus. B. cereus parasitizes the larvae of the codling moth.  Granulovirus  Baculovirus is a virus common among lepidopteran insects. There are two genera in the Baculoviridae: Nucleopolyhedrovirus and Granulovirus. Of these, a granulovirus species specific to codling moths has been identified and studied. Granuloviruses form small granules that each carry one virion. Granuloviruses can be divided into two classes: the 'slow' and 'fast' granuloviruses, which refers to the rate at which the virus kills the host. Fast-killing granuloviruses usually kill the host during the same instar in which it was infected. Cydia pomonella granulovirus is a species of fast granulovirus that is fatally pathogenic to codling moths. Because Cydia pomonella granulovirus is a fast granulovirus, the codling moth larvae dies within the same instar as when infected. The complete genome of Cydia pomonella granulovirus has been sequenced and was found to have 123,500 bp. Three main Cydia pomonella granulovirus isolates have been identified: Cydia pomonella granulovirus-M, E, R. These can be categorized into four genome types: genomes A, B, C, and D. It is believed that genome C is ancestral to the other genomes. Genome C is also less pathogenic to codling moth neonates compared to other genome types. Isolates from Iran have also been identified and were found to have same genome types as the other isolates. = As bioinsecticide = Cydia pomonella granulovirus-M, which is a Mexican isolate strain of Cydia pomonella granulovirus, has been used as a bioinsecticide. Codling moth larvae can be infected with Cydia pomonella granulovirus just by crawling or browsing on infected leaves and fruits. A linear log time/mortality relationship has been found, which indicates that the longer the larva remains in contact with the bioinsecticide sprayed surface, the higher the degree of infection. Aqueous suspension of the granules are sprayed on leaves and fruits, which are then taken up by the larvae. Cydia pomonella granulovirus works most effectively when taken up by neonate larvae, so the bioinsecticide should be applied in concordance to the hatching time schedule of the eggs. Once the granules reach the midgut, which is basic (pH>7), the granules are dissolved and invade the tracheal matrix, epidermis, fat body, and other tissue bodies. During the later stages of infection, the virus form clusters, which causes apoptosis, or programmed cell-death, of host cells and eventually host death. Death of the host occurs within 5‚Äì10 days. Some colonies of codling moths have developed resistance against the commonly used Cydia pomonella granulovirus-M isolate. However, some Cydia pomonella granulovirus-M isolates have overcome that host resistance. Identified isolates, such as 112 and NPP-R1, have shown increased pathogenicity against RGV isolates, which are Cydia pomonella granulovirus resistant colonies of codling moths used in laboratories.  Physiology: Olfaction  = Olfactory receptors = The antennae of the moths are used to detect volatiles released by fruits like apples and pears. Males and females display similar antennal responses to most volatiles, except to codlemone. Males responded more strongly to codlemone than females. Common apple volatiles include (Z)3-hexenol, (Z)3-hexenyl benzoate, (Z)3-hexenyl hexanoate, (¬±)-linalool and E,E-Œ±-farnesene. Non-apple volatiles include pear ester ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate. (E,E)-2,4-decadienal is a corresponding aldehyde for (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate and is released as a defense mechanism by the fifth instar larvae of the European apple sawfly Hoplocampa testudinea. Apples infested with apple sawflies are unsuitable for codling moth larvae because apple sawflies secrete (E,E)-2,4-decadienal as part of their defense secretion. (E,E)-2,4-decadienal also causes a decrease in codling moth male attraction, so female codling moths are deterred by this volatile. = Olfaction sexual dimorphism = Œ±-farnesene is a major volatile released by ripe apples that attracts codling moths. Sexual dimorphism in olfaction has been discovered with regards to this volatile. Both mated and virgin females were attracted to Œ±-farnesene at a low dosage but repelled by it at a high dosage. The degree of response was stronger for mated females. Compared to that, mated males were attracted to a higher dosage of Œ±-farnesene, while mid to low dosage elicited neutral responses. The threshold for mated male attraction was higher, which means the males are not as sensitive to the volatile as the females are. Butyl hexanoate is another sex-specific volatile released by ripe apples. Mated females were attracted by this volatile while males were not affected. Pest control Codling moth caterpillar on an apple Because the caterpillar of the codling moth bore into fruits and stop their growth, codling moths are major agricultural pests. They are widespread and attack a wide range of fruits. In order to control these pests, insecticide has been used extensively. Case study done in British Columbia in the late 1980s and early 1990s showed that damage from codling moths ranged from 25% to 50% of crops being damaged. Another case study at Codling Moth Areawide Management (CAMP) project sites in Washington, California, and Oregon showed that the number of hectares of farms treated with mating disruption insecticides to control codling moths has grown exponentially from 1990 to 2000. = Preventive measures = Regularly pruning the branches of the fruit trees will allow insecticide to reach the insides of the crown better. A crown of a tree is the branches, leaves, and fruits of the tree that stems from the tree trunk. Also, more sunlight can reach the branches after pruning, and sunlight is deadly to the eggs and larvae. Scraping bark from the tree trunk can decrease the number of sites available for pupation. Fallen fruits should be gathered and disposed of regularly. Caterpillars bore into the fruit and cause premature ripening of the fruit and causing the fruit to fall off of the tree. Getting rid of fallen fruits can eliminate caterpillars that are still inside the fruits that have fallen. = Mechanical control = Trunk banding consists of wrapping a corrugated cardboard strip around the tree trunk. Larvae making their way down the tree to pupate after exiting the infested fruits will use bands as pupation sites. Bands may then be removed and burned. Mass-trapping consists of placing kairomonal lures on a high density of sticky traps in orchards. Both male and female moths are attracted to the lure and become stuck in the trap. An experiment conducted over 5 years showed a significant decrease in the number of apples damaged by codling moth.Jaffe, B.D., Gu√©dot, C., and Landolt, P.J. (2018) \\"Mass-Trapping Codling Moth, Cydia pomonella (Lepidopteran: Torticidae), Using a Kairomone Lure Reduces Fruit Damage in Commercial Apple Orchards.\\" Journal of Economic Entomology doi: 10.1093/jee/toy111.  Particle films  Particle films are hydrophobic solutions used to spray crops and plants to prevent damage from pathogens and arthropod pests. A common type of particle film is composed primarily of kaolin clay and adjuvants. Kaolin is a non-abrasive, white material that is found commonly in paint, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. It is an aluminosilicate mineral, which means it is composed of aluminum, silicon, and oxygen. Kaolin clay particle films are used to slow down the activity of larvae and adults. On trees coated with particle films, the larvae displayed decreased walking speed, fruit scavenging activity, and penetration rate. Although hatching rate of the eggs did not differ between treated and untreated trees, female moths oviposited less on film-treated trees. =Chemical control= 250x250px  Synthetic attractants  Successful development of synthetic fruit volatiles has led to increased control of codling moths. Codling moths can be managed and controlled with the use of synthetic apple volatiles, such as (Z)3-hexenol, (Z)3-hexenyl benzoate, (Z)3-hexenyl hexanoate, (¬±)-linalool and E,E-a-farnesene, and other synthetic attractants, such as pear ester ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate and its corresponding aldehyde, E,E-2, 4-decadienal. Attractants are used as lures in codling moth traps, and are widely used in codling moth management programs in orchards.  Growth inhibitors and regulators  Insect growth inhibitors (IGIs) and insect growth regulators (IGRs) are used in insects, especially Lepidoptera, to prevent the synthesis of chitin during development. Chitin is one of the major component which constitutes the exoskeleton of arthropods and cell walls of fungi. Without chitin, insects cannot develop properly. Ovicidal IGIs, such as diflubenzuron, hexaflumuron and teflubenzuron, have been shown to be effective against egg development. Fenoxycarb is an ovicidal IGR, while Tebufenozide is a larvicidal IGR. Flufenoxuron and Methoxyfenozide are an IGI and IGR respectively and are equally effective in preventing growth in eggs as in larvae. In addition to IGRs, reduced-risk pesticides are also used to control codling moth population in apple orchards.250x250px  Insecticide resistance  In recent years, codling moths with insecticide-resistant strains arose. They have become resistant to avermectins, benzoylureas, benzoylhydrazines, neonicotinoids, organophosphates, macrocyclic lactones, pyrethroids. It is believed that this resistance is due to increase in enzymatic activity of the larvae. Low genetic structuration and high rate of gene flow have led to a rapid spread of resistance in European populations. However, there is a fitness cost associated with increased insecticide resistance. Pesticide-resistant codling moths are less fecund, less fertile, slower in development, lighter in weight, and have a shorter life span compared to non-resistant moths. This is believed to be caused by increase in the metabolically costly activities of oxidase and glutathione-S-transferase. Oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes oxidation-reduction reactions. Gluthione- S-transferase is an enzyme that catalyzes a detoxification process involving a conjugation of gluthione into xenobiotic substrates. =Biological control= The codling moth is not a great candidate for biological pest control, as the larvae are well protected within the fruit for the majority of development. However, their eggs are susceptible to biological control by Trichogramma wasps. The wasps deposit their eggs into codling moth eggs, and the developing wasp larvae consume the moth embryo inside. Another candidate for a biological control agent is the wasp Mastrus ridens, also known as the Mastrus ridibundus. This wasp has exhibited a positive response to higher densities of codling moth larvae, a short generation time compared to other parasites of the codling moth, and a high number of female offspring per host larva. These 3 characteristics improve M. ridibundus's ability to control codling moth populations. Parasitism of overwintering codling moth cocoons has reached up to 70%, but most field tests have not demonstrated a dramatic result. M. ridibundus as a biological control is recommended as part of a broader management strategy.

It is the home of a Greek Orthodox monastery traditionally held to have been founded by Byzantine emperor Justinian I, and where a renowned icon of the Virgin Mary is revered by both Christians and Muslims to this day. The town is noted for the large number of (Western Neo-) Aramaic speakers, along with nearby Maaloula and few smaller towns nearby such as Maarat Saidnaya. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Saidnaya had a population of 25,194 in the 2004 census.General Census of Population and Housing 2004.

The Hellenistic-era name for the region centered in the Barada Valley was Abilene: the local tradition has thus long held it as the site where the grave of Abel, slain brother of Cain, lies. Scholars consider it likely that the capital of Abilene was the city of Saidnaya.Vasilakƒì, 2005, p. 278.Garrett, 2007, p. 2-4. Overview Long a center of Christian pilgrimage, pilgrims from all over the world seek Saidnaya for renewal of faith and for healing. Renowned for its faithfulness to Christianity, tradition holds that the Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya was constructed by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in 547 AD, after he had two visions of Mary, one that indicated where to build the church and the other outlining its design. Justinian dedicated the finished project to the feast of Mary's Nativity, and annually thereafter on September 8, and through to the present day, both Muslim and Christian pilgrims have come to commemorate the feast day of Our Lady of Saidnaya.Mannheim, 2001, p. 138. Also located in the convent of Saidnaya is an icon of the Holy Mother and Child known as the Shaghurah and reputed to have been painted by Luke the Evangelist which is believed to protect its owners from harm in times of danger. Due in no small measure to its protected mountainous location, Saidnaya enjoyed religious peace throughout its history, even during times of war, such as during the Crusades. Local Muslims visit the convent sanctuary on the day of Friday prayers and share in the legends regarding this holy place. Christians and Muslims from the region and from far away places seek the shrine for healing.Waddy, 1980, p. 223. Numerous accounts of miraculous healings have been reported, some which are documented in writing by those who experienced them throughout history.Pringle, 1993, pp. 219-220. Saidnaya has about more than 40 chapels and monasteries and the most famous one is the convent of the Virgin Mary. Many other Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Syriac Catholic and Syriac Orthodox churches and monasteries have been built in Saidnaya throughout history. On top of the highest mountain in Saidnaya is the Cherubim Monastery at 2,000 metres (6,561.68 feet) above sea level, overlooking Damascus' fertile plains and Lebanon's mountains. There is also the Monastery of Mar Thomas and a few massive monasteries built more recently such as St. Thomas Creek Catholic Monastery, St. Estphariuos Orthodox Monastery, and St. Ephram Syriac Monastery. A bronze statue of Jesus Christ with 33.10 m high, was installed on 14 October 2013 financed by both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian government, The statue is near the Monastery of the Cherubim, perched above the historic pilgrimage route from Constantinople to Jerusalem. The weather is cold and snowy in winter, while it is warm and has fresh air in summer. Surviving vestiges of caves, grottos and ancient places in and around Saydnaya indicate that it was inhabited by different civilizations from the early Stone Age, with artifacts from Aramaic, Greek, Syriac, Roman, and Arab times.Mannheim, 2001, pp. 136-137. History Saidnaya's origins are in ancient times, and the town has been inhabited since at least the sixth century BC when it was known by its Aramaic name, Danaba. It emerged as an important center of Christianity well before it was adopted as the official religion of the Roman empire. Macarius, the first bishop of Aleppo and later the Patriarch of Antioch, lists Saidnaya in a seventeenth- century Arabic manuscript as one of the seven ancient episcopal cities under Damascus, the same cities represented at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD.Pitard, 1987, p. 150.Porter, 1855, p. 107. =The Icon of the All-Holy Virgin= The Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya In the late 8th century, a certain venerable Marina was abbess of the convent, and she was widely revered for her piety and sanctity of life. It happened that a hermit monk, a Greek pilgrim from Egypt named Theodore, stopped at the convent on his way to the Holy Land. When he was leaving, Abbess Marina asked him to buy in Jerusalem a precious and fine icon of the Holy Virgin. While at Jerusalem, he utterly forgot the task entrusted to him and started on his return journey. However, when he had not gone far from the city, he was stopped short by an unfamiliar voice: \\"Have you not forgotten something in Jerusalem? What have you done in regard to the commission from Abbess Marina?\\" Monk Theodore returned at once to Jerusalem and found an icon of the Theotokos. During the journey back to the convent, he was astounded by the miracles accomplished through the icon. He and his whole caravan were ambushed by bandits, and then attacked by wild beasts. Amidst these dangers, the hermit always invoked the aid of the Holy Virgin while holding her icon, and he and all the caravan were saved from every peril. When Theodore returned to the convent, these events tempted him to keep the valuable icon for himself, and he decided to bypass Saidnaya and sail back to Egypt. However, he was unable to set sail, for such a fierce storm arose, it seemed the ship would inevitably sink. His conscience was pricked, and he quickly left the ship and returned by way of Saidnaya. After spending four days in the convent, he was again possessed by an irresistible desire to make the icon of the Mother of God his own. He apologized to the abbess, pretending that he had been unable to buy the required icon, and then he decided to leave the convent secretly. The next morning, as he was about to set out on the journey back to his own country and approached the convent gate, he was amazed to find that an invisible power barred his way, and it was as though a stone wall stood where the gate should have been. After many futile attempts, he was forced to hand the icon over to the abbess, confessing his intention. With tears of gratitude she glorified the Lord and His All-pure Mother. Today the holy Icon is visited by pilgrims seeking the Virgin Mary's blessings as it is believed to grant (or at least intercede for) healing and fertility miracles. It is notable that Syrian Muslims often visit and pray before the Icon as well. =Construction of the Convent= According to the tradition, emperor Justinian I, while crossing Syria with his troops either on his way to the Holy Land or on a campaign against the Persians, came to this desert, where his army encamped and soon suffered thirst for lack of water. When they despaired, the emperor saw a beautiful gazelle off in the distance. He vigorously gave chase, hunting the animal until it tired and stopped on a rocky knoll and approached a spring of fresh water, but without giving the emperor the opportunity to shoot it. Suddenly, it transformed into an icon of the Theotokos, which shone with a brilliant light. A white hand stretched forth from it and a voice said, \\"No, thou shalt not kill me, Justinian, but thou shalt build a church for me here on this hill.\\" Then the strange heavenly light and majestic figure disappeared. Upon his return, Justinian related what he had seen to his subordinates and ordered them immediately to draw up a plan for the contemplated church. After some time had passed and the architects were unable to resolve the problems of the plan, the Holy Virgin ‚Äî the gazelle ‚Äî reappeared to Justinian in a dream and confided a magnificent plan to him for a convent, of which she would be the protectress. It is said that the basic structure of the convent follows this plan to this day. The convent soon gained such renown that it came to be ranked second only to Jerusalem as a place of pilgrimage, and nuns from every corner of Syria, Egypt, and other lands flocked to it. The holy icon El Chagoura appeared many years after the convent was constructed. =Crusader period= Magister Thietmar, a German pilgrim, wrote of his pilgrimage to Saidnaya, devoting four pages to a description of the icon of Holy Mother and Child found at the convent. He describes the origin story behind the icon and its special properties, and how a holy oil emitted from the breasts of the Virgin Mary is believed to be a miraculous oil that can heal the sick.Folda, 2005, p. 122. In September 1240, after Thibaut de Champagne concluded a treaty with the sultan of Egypt, the Benedict of Alignan made a pilgrimage to St. Mary's of Saidnaya with the sultan's permission. The trip is seen as evidence of both Saidnaya's importance to Christian pilgrims in the thirteenth century and the relative safety of travel for Christians in Muslim areas during this time.Folda, 2005, p. 176. Chronicles from the thirteenth century also report that Templar Knights would go to the mountain monastery in Saidnaya to collect holy oil for Templar churches in Europe.Nicolle, 2005, p. 8. Sednaya Prison To the west of Saidnaya, the government has a military prison with estimated of 14,000 prisoners. The prison lies 30 km on the outskirts of Northern Damascus. In February 2017 Amnesty International released a report saying: \\"that between 5,000 and 13,000 people were extra judicially executed at Saydnaya between September 2011 and December 2015.\\" On May 15, 2017, the US State Department reiterated the charge of 50 secret executions a day, concealed by subsequent cremation on site.

Life  Frederick was born in Karlsruhe on 9 September 1826. He was the third son of Grand Duke Leopold (1790‚Äì1852) and of his wife, Grand Duchess Sophie (1801‚Äì1865), who was born Princess of Sweden, daughter of King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. He became the heir presumptive to the Grand Duchy upon the death of his father in 1852 and the accession of his brother as Grand Duke Louis II. Due to his brother's mental ill-health, he was regent ad interim of Baden in 1852‚Äì1855, and took the title of Grand Duke in 1856. His brother, Louis II, died in 1858. He was considered a relatively liberal supporter of a constitutional monarchy. During his reign the option of civil marriages was introduced in Baden as well as direct elections to the Lower House of the Parliament of Baden in 1904. In 1856, he married Princess Louise, daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and his wife, Augusta of Saxe-Weimar. The couple had three children. The Grand Duke had a pivotal role in the history of the Zionist movement. In 1896 the Grand Duke met Theodor Herzl (the founder of political Zionism) via their mutual acquaintance the reverend William Hechler, and helped Herzl in obtaining an audience with his nephew, Wilhelm II, German Emperor. After some persuasion on the part of the Grand Duke, the Emperor accepted the appeal for an audience. It took place in Palestine on 2 November 1898, during the Kaiser's visit to inaugurate the Church of the Redeemer, Jerusalem. Frederick I was present at the proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles in 1871, as he was the only son-in-law of the Emperor and one of the reigning sovereigns of Germany. He died at his summer residence at the island of Mainau in southern Germany on 28 September 1907.

The film was distributed by Allied Artists as a double feature with another Corman feature, Not of This Earth. The film concerns a second scientific expedition that is sent to a remote Pacific island to discover what happened to the scientists of the first. Unknown to them when they arrive, the island is inhabited by a pair of radiation-mutated giant crabs that not only consumed the members of the first expedition, but absorbed their minds, and now plan to reproduce their kind in numbers. Plot A group of scientists and their support crew of five sailors land on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. They are searching for a previous expedition that disappeared without a trace, and to continue their research on the effects of radiation from the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests on the island's plant and sea life. The scientists on the expedition are led by Dr. Karl Weigand (Leslie Bradley), and also include geologist James Carson (Richard H. Cutting) and biologists Jules Deveroux (Mel Welles), Martha Hunter (Duncan), and Dale Drewer (Garland). Their party also includes technician and handyman Hank Chapman (Johnson). Soon after their arrival, a sailor, Tate (Charles B. Griffith), falls in the water and is killed, his decapitated body floating to the surface. Two sailors (Beach Dickerson and Tony Miller) are left behind to guard the explorers, while the others, led by Ensign Quinlan (Ed Nelson), attempt to return to the mainland, but their seaplane explodes. The scientists are unable to report what happened due to a storm; they decide to stay on the island and continue their research. They read journal entries written by the previous scientific team, which mention killer worm creatures. Martha and Dale go scuba diving. That night, Martha hears \\"McLane\\", leader of the previous expedition, calling out to her. Carson descends into a pit, which opens outside during an inexplicable earthquake, but falls in. The current expedition learns to their horror that the earlier group had been killed and eaten by two mutated, intelligent giant crabs, who have absorbed the minds of their victims and can speak telepathically in their voices. Members of the current expedition are being systematically attacked and killed by the monsters, which are now invulnerable to most standard weaponry because of the mutations to their cell structures. The remaining scientists finally discover that both giant crabs are the cause of the ongoing earthquakes and landslides on the island; they are slowly destroying the island, reducing its size, by undermining it with tunnels. The scientists turn their attention to a way to stop the mating pair of monsters from reproducing. They are able to kill one of the crabs in a cave when their explosive detonates, shaking loose an overhead rock that falls and crushes the head of the monster. As the island continues to fall away into the Pacific, and after barely escaping from their collapsing laboratory building, the surviving trio of Dale, Martha, and Hank finally meet the remaining intelligent giant crab, Hoolar, who speaks to them via telepathy. Hoolar vows to go to the mainland with her fertilized eggs when the island is gone (and the three humans are dead) to feed upon even more people, absorbing those minds in the process. Hank then sacrifices himself by bringing down an electrically-charged broadcast tower directly on top of the giant crab, electrocuting the monster and her unhatched brood. Dale and Martha embrace on the small portion of what remains of the large island.

A video reference monitor also called a broadcast reference monitor or just reference monitor, is a specialized display device similar to a television set, used to monitor the output of a video-generating device, such as playout from a video server, IRD, video camera, VCR, or DVD player. It may or may not have professional audio monitoring capability. Unlike a television set, a video monitor has no tuner and, as such, is unable independently to tune into an over-the-air broadcast like a television receiver. One common use of video monitors is in television stations, television studios, production trucks and in outside broadcast vehicles, where broadcast engineers use them for confidence checking of analog signal and digital signals throughout the system. They can also be used for color grading if calibrated, during post- production. Common display types for video monitors * Cathode ray tube * Liquid crystal display * Plasma display * OLED Common monitoring formats for security * Composite video * S-Video Broadcast reference monitor Broadcast reference monitors must be used for video compliance at television or television studio facilities, because they do not perform any video enhancements and try to produce as accurate an image as possible.EBU - User requirements for Video Monitors in Television ProductionBroadcast Engineering - Broadcast monitors IEEE Xplore 2.0 - Psycho-physical method of television picture quality evaluation (EBU-II) For quality control purposes, it is necessary for a broadcast reference monitor to produce (reasonably) consistent images from facility to facility, to reveal any flaws in the material, and also not to introduce any image artifacts (such as aliasing) that is not in the source material. Broadcast monitors will try to avoid post processing such as a video scaler, line doubling and any image enhancements such as dynamic contrast. However, display technologies with fixed pixel structures (e.g. LCD, plasma) must perform image scaling when displaying SD signals as the signal contains non-square pixels while the display has square pixels. LCDs and plasmas are also inherently progressive displays and may need to perform deinterlacing on interlaced video signals. Some professional video broadcast monitors display information on screen such as the current video signal format they might be receiving i.e.: standard definition formats like 576i, 480i or high definition formats like 720p or 1080p. They also have mechanical buttons to toggle common aspect ratios like (4:3 or 16:9), and underscanning or overscanning a picture to see lines in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of video, and check if subtitles in VBI were inserted properly or not. Modern broadcast grade professional monitors also have safe area grid generators, to help position television graphics such as lower thirds within their respective areas i.e. graphics safe, title safe or action safe.

It was developed and released for the broadcast television industry in 1956 by Ampex, an American company based in Redwood City, California. The first videotape recorder using this format was built in the same year. This format revolutionized broadcast television operations and television production, since the only recording medium available to the TV industry before then was film used for kinescopes, which was much more costly to utilize, could only be used once, images could be ruined by light leaks if the film was not developed and took time to develop at a film laboratory. In addition, kinescope images were usually of obviously inferior quality to the live television broadcast images they recorded, whereas quadruplex videotape preserved almost all the image detail of a live broadcast. Since most United States West Coast network broadcast delays done by the television networks at the time were done with film kinescopes that needed time for developing, the networks wanted a more practical, cost-effective, and quicker way to time- shift television programming for later airing on the West Coast than the expense and time consumption of the processing and editing of film caused. Faced with these challenges, broadcasters sought to adapt magnetic tape recording technology (already in use for recording audio) for use with television as well. The term \\"quadruplex\\" refers to the use of four magnetic record/reproduce heads mounted on a headwheel spinning transversely (width- wise) across the tape at a rate of 14,400 (for 960 recorded stripes per second) rpm for NTSC 525 lines/30fps-standard quad decks, and at 15,000 (for 1,000 stripes per second) rpm for those using the PAL 625 lines/25fps video standard. This method is called quadrature scanning, as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats. The tape ran at a speed of either per second for NTSC 525/30 video recording, or per second for PAL 625/25 video; the audio, control, and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion near the edges of the tape. The cue track was used either as a second audio track, or for recording cue tones or time code for linear video editing. A typical reel of quad tape holds approximately one hour of recorded material at 15 inches per second. The quadruplex format employs segmented recording; each transversely recorded video track on a 2-inch quad videotape holds one-sixteenth (NTSC) or one-twentieth (PAL) of a field of interlaced video. (For NTSC systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field.) This meant that 2-inch quad did not support \\"trick-play\\" functions, such as still, shuttle, and reverse or variable-speed playback. (In fact, the quadruplex format could only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape was playing at normal speed.)Wink Hackman; Expert training for Sony MVS users worldwide Retrieved September 17, 2015) However, it was capable of producing extremely high-quality images containing about 400 horizontal lines of video resolution, and remained the de facto industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in 1956 to the mid-1980s, when newer, smaller, and lower- maintenance videotape formats such as Type C videotape superseded it. There were three different variations of 2-inch quad: *Low-band, which was the first variety of quad introduced by Ampex in 1956, *High-band, which used a wider bandwidth for recording video to the tape, resulting in higher-resolution video from the video tape recorder (VTR), and *Super high-band, which used a pilot tone for better timebase stability, and higher coercivity tape. Most quad machines made later in the 1960s and 1970s by Ampex can play back both low and high-band 2-inch quad tape. History Time-shifting of television programming for the West Coast of the United States by the networks in the 1950s (in order to broadcast their programming at the same local time on the East and West Coasts) using kinescope films was quite a rushed and perilous ordeal. This was because there were only three hours for the West Coast branches of the TV networks to receive video for the programming from the East Coast (live via leased microwave relay or coaxial cable circuits provided by the phone company (AT&T;) at the time), and then to record such to kinescope films, and finally to develop the film to be aired three hours later on the West Coast. This usually meant the kinescope was aired almost immediately after it came straight out of the developing equipment, still warm from the film dryer. These were referred to by the networks as \\"hot kines\\". By 1954, the networks used more raw film stock for kinescopes than all of the Hollywood film studios combined, spending up to $4,000 per half hour. They were desperate to obtain a quicker, less expensive, and more practical solution. In the early 1950s, Ampex and several other companies such as Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE) and RCA were competing to release a videotape format. RCA and BCE did release working prototypes of their recorders, but their downfall was that they all used a longitudinal (stationary-head) method of recording, much like audio tape recorders. This meant that the tape had to be recorded at an extremely high speed (around ) in order to accommodate sufficient bandwidth to reproduce an adequate video image (at least 2‚Äì3 MHz for a watchable image), in turn requiring large amounts of tape on large reels. At the same time, the BBC developed a similar stationary-head video tape recorder (VTR) system that saw some on-air use, called VERA (Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus). Ampex, seeing the impracticality of the prototype BCE and RCA VTRs, started to develop a more practical videotape format with tape economy in mind, as well as providing a solution to the networks' West Coast delay woes. Starting in 1952, Ampex built the Mark I prototype VTR,Mark I head from lionlamb.usMark I head and chart using -wide tape. Ampex decided that instead of having the tape move at high speed past a stationary head to record enough bandwidth for video, the head would be made to move rapidly across the relatively slow moving tape. This resulted in the Mark I using arcuate scanning, which consisted of a spinning disk with a face (where the heads were mounted) which contacted the tape (as opposed to the edge of the headwheel with transverse quadrature scanning). This resulted in an arc-shaped track being recorded across the width of the tape.danalee.ca Transverse Quad chart Arcuate scanning resulted in a head-to-tape speed of about , but problems with timebase stability of the reproduced video signal from the tape led Ampex to abandon arcuate scanning in favor of the more reliable transverse scanning system. Ampex continued through the mid-1950s with the Mark IIMark II from lionlamb.us and Mark IIIMark III prototype recorders, which now used transverse scanning. The Mark II used frequency modulation for recording video to tape, resulting in a much-improved, but still noisy, video image (the Mark I had used amplitude modulation, which resulted in a very poor-quality video signal reproduced from the tape, compounded as well by the shortcomings of the machine's arcuate scanning). The Mark III had improved signal-processing and servo electronics, resulting in much better video reproduction. The Mark III worked well, but its appearance was quite that of a prototype, and not a finished, saleable product. It was in a makeshift wooden case, with several parts of its chassis externally mounted in partially filled racks. Ampex then built the Mark IV by putting Mark III components into a sleek metal console and fully populated rack-mount cases. The Mark IVMark 4 was the machine first publicly demonstrated at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (now the NAB) convention (the NAB Show) in Chicago on April 14, 1956. After William Lodge of CBS finished his speech, the Mark IV replayed his image and words almost immediately, causing \\"pandemonium\\" among the astonished attendees.Wolpin, Stewart. \\"The Race to Video \\". Invention & Technology, Fall 1994. The earlier Mark III was given some cosmetic improvements, and was also demonstrated at Ampex headquarters in Redwood City the same day. Both demonstrations were a success, and Ampex took $2 million in orders for the machine in four days. The VR 1000-B model (1961) The quadruplex system Ampex later released the first manufactured models of quad VTR based on the Mark IV which were also prototypes, the VRX-1000,VRX-1000 being made at Ampex of which 16 were made. Machines made afterward were the final production models, and were designated as the VR-1000. The advertised price for the Ampex Videotape Recorder in late 1956 was $45,000 ().\\"How Much Should a Tape Recorder Cost? [Ampex ad]\\" Broadcasting-Telecasting, 15 October 1956, 220. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1956/1956-10-15-Quarter-Century- BC.pdf In 1957, shortly after Ampex's introduction of the 2-inch quad format, RCA introduced a quad-compatible VTR, the TRT-1A. RCA referred to it as a \\"Television Tape Recorder\\", since the word \\"videotape\\" was a trademark of Ampex at the time.The museum for retired broadcasting equipment in the UK RCA was able to make the TRT-1A and its later machines compatible with 2-inch quad because Ampex assisted RCA in doing so, as an expression of gratitude for RCA assisting Ampex with making their later quad machines after the VR-1000 color- capable. Initially, the VR-1000 was only natively capable of recording and playing back black and white video, but RCA had modified several VR-1000s to record color video for the NBC TV network (which RCA owned at the time) in the late 1950s, since NTSC color video programming was already underway at NBC. Ampex developed and released updated and improved models of their quad decks, beginning with the VR-1000B in mid-1959. At that time, Ampex advertised that some 360-plus VR-1000s had been sold worldwide, more than 250 in the U.S.‚Äîroughly 30 at each network, 100 by independent stations, and 20 by production companies.\\"Announcing the New Ampex VR-1000B,\\" Broadcasting- Telecasting, 22 June 1959, 58-59. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive- BC/BC-1959/1959-06-22-BC.pdf The second-generation VR-2000VR-2000 appeared in 1964. followed by a scaled-down economy version, the VR-1200, in 1966 and the AVR series of VTRs, AVR-1, AVR-2, and AVR-3 in the 1970s. The AVR-2 was the most compact of quad VTRs, using conventional 120 volt (V) single-phase household-type AC power to operate, rather than the 208 or 220 V three-phase AC power required by larger quad machines. RCA released later models of quad VTRs as well, such as the TR-22, TR-70, and TR-600. CBS was the first television network to use 2-inch quad videotape, using it for a West Coast delay of Douglas Edwards and the News on November 30, 1956.\\"Charles P. Ginsburg\\".

Ellis, John; Hall, Nick (2017): ADAPT. figshare. Collection.https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1 Edit control At first, editing was accomplished by physically cutting and splicing the 2\\" magnetic tape. The tape was \\"developed\\" using a solution of fine iron powder suspended in a liquid solvent, marketed as \\"Edivue\\" Magnetic Developer. Using a special splicing block (such as the then-industry standard Smith Splicer) equipped with a microscope to view the developed tracks, the editor could then see their patterns and then cut between them. Some 2\\" splicing blocks instead used a read-only tape head connected to an oscilloscope that enabled the editor to electronically view cue tones or the control track pulses on the tape to determine where the tape should be cut. See linear video editing for details. Ampex developed and introduced all-electronic videotape editing, making the physical splicing of videotape practically obsolete, with its breakthrough Editec system in 1963; by recording cue tones on the tape, the editor could make frame-accurate edits. RCA had an \\"electronic splicer\\" in their TR-4/5 and TR-22 VTRs for frame-accurate edits. In 1967 EECO created and introduced the EECO-900 edit controller, which used their proprietary On-Time time code (the later and more standard SMPTE time code had not yet been developed), which was used in conjunction with the quad machines of the time, and was the successor to Ampex's Editec. The EECO-900 and On-Time timecode were developed from EECO's previous work and products developed for NASA for logging and timecoding of their telemetry tapes during space missions. In 1971, CMX, a collaborative between CBS and Memorex, introduced the first computer-based edit controller using SMPTE time code for editing. The CMX 200 could control both the source (A-roll) and record (B-roll) quad VTRs. CMX continued to make more powerful edit controllers capable of controlling more VTRs and peripheral devices, such as switchers, DVEs and character generators. In 1976, Bosch introduced the Mach One list-management edit controller, a lower-cost (and less powerful) post-production alternative to CMX edit controllers. At the time, both CMX and Bosch edit controllers utilized similar DEC computers as their basic hardware. The Fernseh division of Bosch in Germany released the BCM-40 quadruplex VTR in the 1970s. It was only marketed in Europe, and was not sold in the U.S. As 1\\" Type B and 1\\" Type C VTRs came on the market, list- management editing bays sometimes used a combination of both 1\\" and 2\\" VTRs; however, 2\\" VTRs soon began to disappear from both broadcast and post- production facilities, as the newer 1\\" machines were smaller, more dependable, used tape that was far less expensive to purchase, and were capable of recording stereo audio tracks.

The VTRs were never sold abroad. The history of Polish Television (document in Polish) Military applications AMPEX VTR VR-3000 Because the Ampex VR-3000 model was self-contained portable, the U.S. military used it in a wide variety of reconnaissance applications in various vehicles and aircraft. Its ability to accurately record a wide bandwidth of signals, especially high-frequency signals, was a definite advantage for signals intelligence applications. 2-inch quad today 2-inch quad is no longer used as a mainstream format in TV broadcasting and video production, having long ago been supplanted by easier-to-use, more practical and lower-maintenance analog tape formats like 1\\" Type C (1976), U-matic and Betacam. Television and video industry changes to digital video tape (DVCAM, DVCPro and Digital Betacam) and high-definition (HDCAM) are making analog tape formats increasingly obsolete. When it was in use, 2-inch quad VTRs required ongoing maintenance, usually 3-phase power or one phase 220 V to operate, plus an air compressor to provide air pressure for the air bearing that the spinning transverse headwheel rode on due to its high rotational speed (some quad VTRs, such as the portable Ampex VR-3000, used ball bearings instead due to the lack of availability of compressed air, but these wore out quickly). Operation of VR-1000-era machines required the skills of a highly trained video engineer. When a tape was changed, the operator spent as much as half-an-hour, \\"lining-up\\" the VTR ‚Äî that is, carrying out specialized technical adjustments to calibrate the machine to the tape before it was ready for playback. From VR-1200/2000 onward, improvements in head manufacturing/refurbishing tolerances, timebase correction, and greater thermal stability of solid-state electronics made tape changes possible in under a minute and servo calibrations needed only once per shift. From AVR-1 onward, servos were self calibrating and tape changes as fast as the operator could articulate threading. The few quadruplex VTRs which remain in service are used for the transfer and/or restoration of archival 2-inch quad videotape material to newer data storage formats, although mainstream TV serials from the 1950s to late 1960s have mostly already been remastered onto more modern media some years ago, even digitized within the last decade.

Over the course of fifty years, from the 1930s until his death in 1983, Von Bruenchenhein produced an expansive oeuvre of poetry, photography, painting, drawing and sculpture. His body of work includes over one thousand colorful, apocalyptic landscape paintings; hundreds of sculptures made from chicken bones, ceramic and cast cement; pin-up style photos of his wife, Marie; plus dozens of notebooks filled with poetic and scientific musings. Never confined to one particular method or medium, Von Bruenchenhein continually used everyday, discarded objects to visually explore imagined past and future realities. Early life Edward Eugene Von Bruenchenhein was born on July 31, 1910 in Marinette, Wisconsin. The second of three sons, Eugene was only seven years old when his mother, Clara Von Bruenchenhein died. Soon after his father, Edward, married Elizabeth ‚ÄúBessie‚Äù Mosley, a schoolteacher. A woman of literary and artistic ambitions, Bessie ‚Äúbecame a model of creativity and intellectual exploration for the young Eugene.‚ÄùLisa Stone, \\"Thoughts on the Art of Eugene Von Bruenchenhein,\\" Folk Art, Fall 2007: 84 After graduating high school, Eugene worked for a florist and cultivated a growing collection of exotic plants and cacti at his father's home. His passion for horticulture would later be visible in his repeated use of floral motifs and leaf patterns. In 1939 he met the woman who would become his future wife and muse ‚Äì Evelyn Kalka. She was 19, he was 29. In 1943 they married and Evelyn came to be known as ‚ÄúMarie,‚Äù a name she took on in honor of one of Eugene‚Äôs favorite aunts. While Von Bruenchenhein worked at a bakery, he and Marie moved into his father‚Äôs former storefront at 514 South 94th Place. It was here that Eugene and Marie established an ‚Äúall-encompassing‚Äù world of their own ‚Äì a world where stages of exotic theaters were mounted, where everyday items fueled his creativity. For the next forty years, Von Bruenchenhein not only made his home the site of his artistic production, but also an integral part of his creative process. After his death, it stood as ‚Äúa patchwork of pastel colors and applied architectural ornament,‚Äù which was ‚Äúguarded by mask-like concrete monuments within lilac bushes on the periphery.‚ÄùLisa Stone,‚ÄúEugene Von Bruenchenhein,‚Äù Raw Vision, Winter 1994/5: 33. Photography Von Bruenchenhein began his prolific career as an amateur photographer. In the early 1940s, after setting up a darkroom in his bathroom, he started to photograph his wife, Marie, at home. Nevertheless, his photographs extended past the walls of their bedroom. Using leftover materials as backdrops and props, Von Bruenchenhein created transformative stages for Marie to pose on; he invited her to dress up in exotic costumes.Lisa Stone,‚ÄúEugene Von Bruenchenhein,‚Äù Raw Vision, Winter 1994/5: 36. Many of these portraits evoke the ‚Äúpin up‚Äù girls of the 1950s. As the main object of attraction, Marie coyly confronts the viewer to question the relationship between photographer and subject, husband and wife, artist and muse. By the mid 1950s, these intimate shots had reached the thousands. Paintings In 1954 Von Bruenchenhein shifted his focus from photography to painting. Restrained by a limited budget, Von Bruenchenhein displayed remarkable thrift in the development of his skills and the production of his paintings. Notably, he often painted ‚Äúat his kitchen table on Masonite or discarded cardboard-box panels salvaged from the bakery.‚ÄùBrett Littman, \\"Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist‚ÄîPoet and Sculptor‚ÄîInovator‚ÄîArrow maker and Plant man‚ÄîBone artifacts constructor‚ÄîPhotographer and Architect‚ÄîPhilosopher,‚Äù New York: American Folk Art Museum, 2011: 40 From 1954 to 1963, Von Bruenchenhein created around 950 paintings. Each successive painting provided an opportunity to further develop his painting skills. Notably, 1954 marked a major moment: he began to paint with his fingers. Carefully manipulating oil paint with his fingers and tools, like sticks, leaves, combs, cardboard, burlap, tar paper, and crumpled paper, Von Bruenchenhein established his own distinct process. His paintings from this period investigated the power of nuclear energy. Within his canvases, Von Bruenchenhein created fantastical scenes of exploding bursts. His imaginative lexicon came to include ‚Äúunderwater flora and fauna, bulging-eyed beasts and serpents, and fantasy architecture.‚ÄùPaul S. D‚ÄôAmbrosio, ‚ÄúEugene Von Bruenchenhein‚Äù Encyclopedia of American Folk Art, ed. Gerard C. Wertkin, New York: Routledge, 616 From the mid-1960s to late 1970s, Von Bruenchenhein turned away from painting and dedicated his time to sculpture. Nevertheless, in the late 1970s, he returned to the medium. This time, however, his paintings were informed by the decade he spent constructing architectural bone sculptures. His later paintings offer up vast open scenes of architectural towers and clouded skies. Sculptures =Ceramics= From the late 1960s to the early 1980, Von Bruenchenhein dedicated himself to developing his craft as a skilled manipulator of clay. After locating a few clay deposits from nearby construction sites, he began a series of sculpted ‚Äúfoliate forms,‚Äù ranging from delicate pink blossoms to leafy greens. These forms soon began to take on a more sophisticated structure. Leaf pots soon evolved into a collection of more complex ‚Äúfoliate vessels.‚ÄùBrett Littman, \\"Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist‚ÄîPoet and Sculptor‚ÄîInovator‚ÄîArrow maker and Plant man‚ÄîBone artifacts constructor‚ÄîPhotographer and Architect‚ÄîPhilosopher,‚Äù New York: American Folk Art Museum, 2011: 24 Vase-like forms evolved from conjoined florets. His ceramic collection also reveals a shift in focus from more realist botanical shapes to more imaginative constructions. Crowns and headdresses began to appear. Von Bruenchenhein‚Äôs regard for royal regalia points to his belief that his family ‚Äúwas descended from royalty from the German region of Lower Saxony.‚Äù Revealingly, in one self-portrait, he offered the words ‚ÄúEdward the First, Kind of Lesser Lands + Tie Cannot Touch‚Äù as a self-proclaimed caption.Lisa Stone, \\"Thoughts on the Art of Eugene Von Bruenchenhein,\\" Folk Art, Fall 2007: 87 =Bone sculptures= During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Von Bruenchenhein continued exploring architectural forms and symbols of royalty in his enigmatic bone sculptures. Once again displaying remarkable ingenuity, he found purpose and function in the discarded ‚Äì in leftover chicken and turkey bones. Architecturally imposing bone structures resulted. After soaking the bones in ammonia and drying them on his stove, Von Bruenchenhein would glue them together to create towers and miniature thrones. In their color and stature, these structures suggested regal grandeur. Some towers reached five feet in height. He lacquered his chair sculptures in gold and metallic hues. As a collection, the sculptures highlight Von Bruenchenhein's skillful ability to create elegant ‚Äúlacelike‚Äù forms out of webs of bones and glue.Lisa Stone, \\"Thoughts on the Art of Eugene Von Bruenchenhein,\\" Folk Art, Fall 2007: 88 Drawings Despite being his least well-known medium, drawing holds a significant position in Von Bruenchenhein‚Äôs collection. It connects two seemingly disparate studies of his work: his floral constructions and his architectural structures. From 1964 to 1966, Von Bruenchenhein used small swatches of wallpaper as his canvas for ink drawings. Seemingly ‚Äúproducts of an open-ended, generative experimentation,‚Äù the drawings include expanding spirals, zig-zagging scaffolds, and exploding diamonds.Brett Littman, \\"Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist‚ÄîPoet and Sculptor‚ÄîInovator‚ÄîArrow maker and Plant man‚ÄîBone artifacts constructor‚ÄîPhotographer and Architect‚ÄîPhilosopher,‚Äù New York: American Folk Art Museum, 2011: 46 Legacy Now a prominent figure in the world of ‚Äúself- taught‚Äù art, Von Bruenchenhein remained anonymous to the larger artistic community for the duration of his career. Remarkably, he produced thousands of pieces of art within the confines of his home-turned-studio. During his lifetime, only close friends and family knew of their existence. Although Von Bruenchenhein's pieces remained out of sight, it is not for want of trying. In an effort to sell and exhibit his work, Von Bruenchenhein repeatedly approached local galleries, but to no avail. It was only after his death on January 24, 1983, that Daniel Nycz, a close friend and supporter, got the attention of Russell Bowman, the director of the Milwaukee Art Museum. In September 1983, the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, began cataloguing the entire collection.Mary Louise Schumacher, \\"Eugene Von Bruenchenhein's moment,\\" Journal Sentinel Exhibitions In 1984, the Kohler center launched its first ever exhibit of Von Bruenchenhein's work. Now, Von Bruenchenhein's work is garnering newfound attention. Notably, in 2010 Von Bruenchenhein‚Äôs work received ‚Äúits first in-depth museum exhibition‚Äù at the American Folk Art Museum.Roberta Smith, \\"Meager Means, Rich Imagination,\\" The New York Times November, 4, 2010 l The exhibit, entitled \\"Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist‚ÄîPoet and Sculptor‚ÄîInovator‚ÄîArrow maker and Plant man‚ÄîBone artifacts constructor‚ÄîPhotographer and Architect‚ÄîPhilosopher‚Äù displayed over 125 of Von Bruenchenhein‚Äôs photographs, sculptures, paintings, and drawings.

The storyline concerns the attempts by an extraterrestrial humanoid to surreptitiously secure the blood of humans and to test it on himself as a treatment for a fatal blood disorder which is ravaging the population of his home planet, Davanna. Plot A man who is not of this Earth (Paul Birch) has adopted the name \\"Mr. Johnson\\" for moving among the populace of Los Angeles. The alien has a sensitivity to high-decibel sounds and is conspicuous only for his stilted and formal syntax and his sunglasses, which he wears even in the dark. The sunglasses hide his blank, white-eyed stare which kills his victims by burning through their eyes and into their brains. He removes the blood of his first victim (a teenage girl who has just been dropped off by her boyfriend) using a system of tubes and canisters that he keeps in an aluminum attach√© case. Johnson is from the planet Davanna, where the inhabitants have developed an incurable blood disease, and he has been sent to Earth to examine the blood of humans for its usefulness in curing Davanna's dying race. Johnson is answerable to an authority on Davanna with whom he can communicate through a device hidden behind a sliding panel in the living room of his Griffith Park mansion. His bodyguard, Jeremy (Jonathan Haze), who also acts as his chauffeur and houseboy, provides him support and protection, but is unaware of his being an alien. Johnson hires nurse Nadine (Beverly Garland) to look after him in his house. Her boss, town physician Dr. Rochelle (William Roerick), is under Johnson's hypnotic control after finding out about his patient's peculiar blood cell structure. With a limit on the number of transfusions he can be given, Johnson takes to murdering locals and draining their blood. Adding to his victims are a strolling Chinese-American man, a sleazy door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, and a trio of homeless male drunkards. The police are mystified by these \\"vampire killings\\". Johnson's plans are disturbed by the unexpected and sudden appearance of a female from Davanna (Anna Lee Carroll). While Johnson can command Earth humans through telepathy, even to the point of using their native languages, he can also completely communicate with his fellow aliens through telepathy. The alien female asks him for an immediate transfusion, because her physical condition is rapidly deteriorating. Johnson breaks into Rochelle's office, but by accident he steals blood contaminated with rabies. Later, the Davanna woman collapses in the street, dying at a hospital. Nadine's friend, police patrolman Harry Sherbourne (Morgan Jones), tries to question Dr. Rochelle about the dead woman, but he is unable to speak while under Johnson's mind control. As a precaution, now fearing discovery, Johnson sends a bizarre oxygen-activated umbrella-like flying alien creature to kill Rochelle. He eradicates Jeremy, who has discovered evidence of Johnson's murderous tendencies. Nadine, whom he attempts to kidnap and take with him, manages to call the police as Johnson chases her through the park in his car. Johnson abandons her and flees, pursued by the arriving Sherbourne on his motorcycle. When Sherbourne turns on his siren, Johnson (to whom the sound is immensely painful) loses control of his car and dies in a crash. After Johnson's burial, Sherbourne and Nadine stand by his grave, which bears the inscription \\"Here lies a man who was not of this Earth\\". While Sherbourne expresses mild compassion for Johnson, for his motivation to rescue his world and its dying populace, Nadine refuses to offer any kind of pity. They leave, just as a mysterious man, wearing dark sunglasses, approaches the grave site. Like Johnson, he wears the same sunglasses and carries the same distinctive case containing transfusion equipment.

National governments are encouraged to join GMI as Partner Countries, while other non-State organizations may join GMI's extensive Project Network. As a public-private initiative, GMI creates an international platform to build capacity, development methane abatement strategies, engage in technology transfer, and remove political and economic barriers to project development for emissions reduction. The initiative currently focuses on five sectors, which are known sources of anthropogenic methane emissions: agriculture, coal mining, municipal solid waste, municipal wastewater, and oil and gas systems. Through international cooperation, GMI seeks to reduce global methane emissions, the second largest contributor to atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, in order to enhance economic growth, promote energy security, improve the environment, and reduce greenhouse gases. Other expected benefits include improving mine safety, reducing waste, and improving local air quality. History and Organization The partnership initiative known as GMI, began as the \\"Methane to Markets Partnership\\" launched during the George W. Bush Administration in November 2004. The original partnership was formed at a Ministerial Meeting in Washington, D.C. when 14 national governments formally committed to reduce methane emissions from key sectors. In 2004, the U.S. pledged US$53 million over an initial five-year period. The partnership assumed a new name‚Äîthe Global Methane Initiative (GMI) -- under the Obama Administration, in 2010, when the U.S. pledged an additional US$50 million to support GMI. The scope of GMI activities has since expanded into other sectors. GMI brings together state and non-state actors in a collaborative public-private partnership. GMI is the only international effort to specifically target methane abatement, recovery and use by focusing on five key sectors of anthropogenic emissions: agriculture, coal mines, municipal solid waste, municipal wastewater, and oil and gas systems. The Initiative complements other international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. GMI's Steering Committee guides the work and activities of the partnership on a broad level. The Steering Committee is supported by the Secretariat‚Äîalso known as the Administrative Support Group (ASG), which is housed at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). GMI directs five technical sector subcommittees: the Agricultural Subcommittee; Coal Mines Subcommittee; Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Subcommittee; Municipal Wastewater Subcommittee; and Oil and Gas Subcommittee. The 5 subcommittees guide GMI's sector-specific activities and promote GMI's methane abatement and recovery strategies among the Partner Countries and Project Network members. Each subcommittee has developed an action plan to coordinate and implement GMI activities. Subcommittees Agriculture Subcommittee: The agricultural sector is one of the key sectors of focus for GMI. The partnership focuses on mitigating methane emitted during the decomposition of livestock manure and the organic components in agro- industrial wastewater. The subcommittee works with members of the international community to install anaerobic digestion systems and biogas production technology in agricultural regions around the world. Anaerobic digesters turn livestock and agro-industrial waste‚Äîotherwise a large source of methane emissions‚Äîinto biogas for use on farms or within the local community. Coal Mines Subcommittee: Methane is emitted from both underground and surface coal mining operations, including both active and abandoned mines. Methane is also emitted from post-mining activities such as processing, storage and transportation. The GMI Coal Mines Subcommittee seeks to development coal mine methane (CMM) projects to advance methane recovery and use at coal mines. Municipal Solid Waste Subcommittee: Methane is emitted from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills around the world, although opportunities exist to reduce methane emissions by collecting landfill gas containing methane and converting it into a source of fuel. Methane emissions from landfills can also be reduced through better waste management, such as modifying waste collection practices. The MSW Subcommittee works with GMI members to develop climate-friendly MSW solutions. Municipal Wastewater Subcommittee: The Municipal Wastewater Subcommittee was launched in October 2011, making it GMI's newest sector- specific subcommittee. Within the wastewater sector, methane is produced when organic matter in wastewater decomposes. Depending on management practices, methane is emitted during the collection, handling and treatment of wastewater. The Municipal Wastewater Subcommittee works with GMI partners to develop and employ management practices that reduce the amount of methane emitted from wastewater operations. Oil and Gas Subcommittee: Methane is emitted from oil and gas systems during both normal operations and systems disruption. Methane losses from oil and gas systems account for more than 20 percent of total methane emissions worldwide. The amount of methane emitted from a facility depends on equipment type and condition, maintenance procedures and the frequency of maintenance, and operations at the facility under consideration. The subcommittee works with project members to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas activities. Membership The initiative intends to pursue its goals through collaboration among developed countries, developing countries, and countries with economies in transition‚Äîalong with participation from the private sector, development banks, and other governmental and non-governmental organizations. On 16 November 2004, 14 countries launched the original initiative by signing the Terms of Reference document that outlines the initiative's goals, organization, and functions. As of February 2015, 41 countries and the European Commission have joined the initiative. GMI Partner Countries together contribute approximately 70 percent of the world's anthropogenic methane emissions. Through GMI, cumulative methane emission reductions have totalled more than 159 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e). * Founding partner from 2004 Project Examples Gas Cogeneration Project in Poland: In 2011, GMI funded a feasibility study showing that it was economically feasible to extract methane from the abandoned Zory Coal Mine in Poland for conversion to liquefied natural gas. The report estimated that the project could eliminate 490,000 billion [cubic metrecubic meters] in methane emissions annually. Based on these findings, a 2-megawatt combined heat and power cogeneration unit was installed. The plant is fuelled with gas extracted from the abandoned mine. The power and thermal energy generated at the plant produces ~46,500 kilowatt-hours of energy per day‚Äîenough to power more than 11,000 households. Waste Management in Nigeria: In 2011, GMI awarded a grant to the Nigerian Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) for studies evaluating the feasibility of capturing landfill gas from the Abule Egba and Solous Landfills. Based on their findings, LAWMA developed a landfill gas energy project, which provides a reliable source of electricity to local residents.

Arguing that the government is insufficiently concerned with securing the U.S. border, they have organized several state chapters, with the intention of providing law enforcement agencies with evidence of immigration law violations. The group was one of several that emerged for the proliferation of civilian border patrol groups at the US-Mexico border. It is shown that the emergence of these groups can be linked, on the one hand, to an increasing criminalization and securitization of immigration.Simcox states that the group merely reports incidents to law enforcement, and does not directly confront immigrants. There is a standard operating procedure (SOP) that must be followed by Minutemen volunteers. Rules include not speaking to, approaching, gesturing towards or having physical contact in any way with any suspected border crossers they may see. The organization has been criticized as being a right-wing militia. History and Activities Chris Simcox founds the Civil Homeland Defense organization, being the first antecedent of the group to patrol the borders, but were disbanded after her first arrest. The 1st of April of 2005, the group renaming the group Minuteman Civil Defense Corps was a militia organization concerned with border security that invokes the image of Revolutionary War militiamen and traces his motivation to \\"protect the american borders\\",ready at a moment's notice to fight for America's freedom. Although the majority of the group's members are Caucasians, some Mexican Americans work to patrol the borders as well, deeply the organization's call to protect legal immigration as a measure to protect American society and resources, approximately 900 volunteers patrol a twenty-three-mile section of the Arizona-Mexico border. The MCDC is often confused with or thought to be affiliated with The Minuteman Project Inc., but the two groups are wholly distinct. The militants have been accused of racial profiling, however, approaching persons of color, asking whether they speak English, asking where they live, and questioning them while not quizzing Caucasians in the same areas. The group was originally co-founded by American neo-Nazi, J. T. Ready. The Minuteman Civil Defense Corps web site spells out a \\"standard operating procedure\\" for Minutemen, which includes directives such as \\"Minutemen are courteous to everyone with whom they come into contact, and never discriminate against anyone for any reason.\\" The group holds up an American ideal as part of its appeal for volunteers; illegal immigration is portrayed as the reason for the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs, health care crises in emergency rooms on the borders, education problems in border state districts, and other socio-economic problems. =Arrested Members= The first time that Simcox was arrested by federal park rangers on a stretch along the Arizona-Mexico border. Simcox was armed with a single pistol, police scanner radios, and was charged with a misdemeanor, subsequently serving a year on probation. His principal objective was clear, stop the illegal Mexican border crossings. On March 15, 2010, Minuteman Civil Defense Corps President Carmen Mercer sent an e-mail to the group's members in which she stated, After receiving what she described as a \\"dramatic\\" response from members who promised to return to the border armed, Mercer called for the dissolution of the group on March 23 citing her concern of being held responsible should members fail to follow the proper \\"rules of engagement\\". On June 8, 2016, Minuteman Civil Defense Corps co-founder Chris Simcox was found guilty of child molestation, and on July 11, 2016, was sentenced to serve 19.5 years in an Arizona prison.

He is credited among other contemporary writers as bringing horror comics back to prominence. Early life Niles was born in Jackson, New Jersey on June 21, 1965. He was raised in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, developing various creative interests in music, writing, and making amateur films. He worked in several comic book stores and played in the punk bands Gray Matter and Three, both of which released records on Dischord Records label in the 1980s and 1990s. He often credited late night television horror host, Count Gore De Vol, who was the local horror host on Channel 20, as an early influence.Interview with Steve Niles at Midtown Comics Times Square; YouTube; May 29, 2010 In 2004 Count Gore wrote the introduction to the graphic novel Aleister Arcane, which is about the horror host of the same name.De Vol, Count Gore. Aleister Arcane. IDW Publishing. October 2004. Introduction. Other influences included Richard Matheson's book I Am Legend, and the works of George A. Romero, John Carpenter and Bernie Wrightson, the latter two of whom he would later work with. He had no formal education in writing following high school, explaining that he learned to write through copious reading. Career Niles' start in the comics industry began with the formation of his self publishing company, Arcane Comix. Niles published, edited, and adapted several comics and anthologies for Eclipse Comics, working on I Am Legend in 1991. He then wrote several titles for Fantaco in the early 1990s, including Bad Moon, Fly in My Eye, and a set of lithographs for Clive Barker's Book of Blood. He worked for a year on Disney's Toy Story Web Adventures, and later worked for Todd McFarlane Productions where he wrote several issues of Spawn, Spawn: The Dark Ages. He also collaborated on Hellspawn with illustrator Ashley Wood after Brian Michael Bendis's departure, and did journalism work for Kiss Magazine, interviewing members of the band Kiss. Niles attempted to shop around his screenplay for 30 Days of Night, but was met with rejection in Hollywood. When IDW Publishing formed, Niles sent his \\"reject list\\" to Ted Adams, who selected 30 Days of Night as a concept he was interested in. Niles and illustrator Ben Templesmith produced the first issue for free. The book did not sell well, according to Niles, but it was then that film producers took notice of it, and optioned it to be adapted into a film in 2000 or 2001. Niles at a book signing for Mystery Society #1 at Midtown Comics Times Square, May 29, 2010. In 2004 or 2005, Niles formed a joint venture production company, Creep International, with 1990s rocker and film director Rob Zombie. This project has produced two works to date: The Nail (with Nat Jones) through Dark Horse Comics, and Bigfoot (with Richard Corben) through IDW Publishing. Upon placing that venture on hiatus, he then assisted actor Thomas Jane's production company, with the intention of bringing his Criminal Macabre character Cal MacDonald to the big screen. MGM optioned the property, but it lapsed, and is currently held by Universal Pictures. Niles and Jane also co-wrote the six-issue comic book series Bad Planet for Image Comics with artists Lewis Larosa and Tim Bradstreet. In 2006, Niles collaborated with artist Scott Hampton on a Batman miniseries, Gotham County Line, published by DC Comics. That same year, he wrote another miniseries that reinvents Steve Ditko's vintage character The Creeper with DC artist Justiniano. He is also created a new DC character with artist Scott Hampton, named Simon Dark. Dark is a vigilante hero with elements of the Frankenstein mythos\\"Introducing... Simon Dark\\" who starred in eighteen issues of his own ongoing series. In October 2007, Steve recorded an introduction to the Washington, D.C.'s International Horror Film Festival, The Spooky Movie Film Festival, in honor of opening night host, Count Gore De Vol, who was being honored for his 35 years in Washington, D.C. Posters for 30 Days of Night were given out, including one signed by Niles. In 2007 Niles wrote a story for the DC Infinite Halloween Special called \\"Strange Cargo\\". Narrated by Poison Ivy, the story tells of Superman, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen uncovering zombies in a cargo tank owned by Lex Luthor.

","title":"Steve Niles"},{"id":"2351584","text":"Rumford's Soup (Rumfordsche Suppe, also called economy soup) was an early effort in scientific nutrition. It was invented by Count Rumford circa 1800 and consumed in Munich and greater Bavaria, where he was employed as an advisor to the Duke. It was used as a ration for the poor, for Bavarian workhouses and military workhouses, and prisoners. Count Rumford has been credited in many instances for \\"establishing the first real soup kitchen.\\" As a reformatory measure, the Bavarian government intended to institute workhouses for those on welfare. Rumford's charge was to provide the cheapest possible ration that was still a high-calorie, nutritious food. The soup came to be well known among philanthropic-minded people throughout Germany at the time, and Rumford set up his soup kitchens in many German cities. ISSN 0043-7425 Rumford's soup was a common base for inexpensive military rations in Central Europe for much of the nineteenth and twentieth century.  Ingredients  Rumford's soup contained equal parts of pearl barley or barley meal and dried peas, vegetables, four parts potato, salt according to need, and sour beer, slowly boiled until thick. The use of potatoes came into use in later versions of the soup. It was typically eaten with bread. It has been stated that Rumford's recipe called for the bread to be served uncooked, and \\"added just before serving the soup.\\" One account describes the soup as being poured atop the bread just prior to serving. Rumford noted that the barley served to significantly thicken the soup and provide a richness to it, and he considered the cereal grain as \\"the rice of Great Britain.\\" Some versions were composed of cereals, minor amounts of meat and other ingredients. Not noted as particularly tasty, it is palatable with long, slow cooking.  Nutrition  Rumford's Soup was designed to provide a high degree of nutrition at a minimal expense. It has been estimated that the soup provided one-third of a person's minimal (daily) nutritional requirements. Rumford's soup is naturally low-fat, with high protein content from the dried peas, and both complex carbohydrates from the potato and barley and simple carbohydrates from the beer. Given the knowledge of the day, it was close to an optimum solution to the problem of creating cheap, nutritious food. Unfortunately, the need for vitamins and trace elements was unknown, but Rumford's soup was sometimes supplemented with corn or herring which supplied adequate vitamin C and vitamin D. In popular culture The soup is occasionally served today to illustrate the past, such as at the \\"Oide Wiesn\\" historical section of the Oktoberfest celebrations in Munich, meant to recreate Oktoberfest in the \\"olden days\\".

Lohanas claim to be descendants of the Luva, son of Rama, and to descend from the Raghuvanshi dynasty. The Lohanas are divided into many separate cultural groups as a result of centuries apart in different regions. Thus there are significant differences between the culture, language, professions and societies of Gujarati Lohanas, Sindhi Lohanas, Kutchi Lohanas, Balochi Lohana, and Pashtun Lohana. History Gujarati lohanas trace their origin to Saurashtra region in present-day state of Gujarat, India. =Sindhi Lohanas= Sindh fell under the Muslim rule of Muhammad bin Qasim after defeat of Dahir. Its Hindus were increasingly pressured to convert to Islam. It was around this time that Uderolal - a Sindhi Hindu Lohana also known as Jhulelal, Dariyalal and Jinda Pir - assumed the mantle of Lohana and Hindu leadership. Today Uderolal is revered by both Sindhis and Sufis, thus both Hindus and Muslims visit the site of his tomb. For two centuries after him, Lohanas d lived without fear until they found themselves being increasingly threatened and persecuted in Sindh due to their Hindu identity. It was then that they began to migrate mainly towards Kutch and Saurashtra. Sindhi Lohanas have since been divided into several groups, among which are: * Amils: generally involved in clerical jobs in government offices, as working in posts of revenue collectors and other senior positions * Bhaibands: mainly involved in trade and commerce and so mostly merchants.The community was involved in international and trade in interior of Sindh even before the arrival of the British. They also played an important part in the development of the city of Karachi * Sahitis: placed somewhere between Amils and Bhaibands, they could be either in government service or traders * Ladii-Lohana(Ladii-Sindhi) : Traditionally these were farmers and landowners whose ancestors tilled land for rice and build the community of Hindu-Sindhis near and around Hyderabad,Sindh but had to leave all types of assets and wealth behind during partition.They remain true to their ancestors identity and values even during all the skirmishes faced during that time(800 AD to 1800's) due to continuous invasions. Society and culture Lohanas largely follow Hindu rituals and worship Hindu deities such as Krishna. They worship avatars of Vishnu such as Rama with his consort Sita and Krishna in the form of Shrinathji. They worship Shakti in the form of Ravirandal Mataji, and Ambika. The 19th century saints Jalaram Bapa, and Yogi ji Maharaj, also attract many Lohana devotees. Their main clan deities are Veer Dada Jashraj, Harkor Ba, Sindhvi Shree Sikotar Mata and Dariyalal. The Sun is also worshipped by the community. =Formation of Khoja and Memon Islamic communities= The community's oral history says that the decline of their kingdom began after the death of Veer Dada Jashraj. It also says that their name derives from the city of Lohargadh (/Lohanpur/Lohkot) in Multan, from which they migrated in the 13th century after the establishment of Muslim rule there. Pir Sadardin converted some Lohanas to the Shia Ismaili Nizari sect of Islam in the 15th century. As Lohanas were worshippers of Shakti, the emergence of a devotional Ismaili oral tradition that incorporated indigenous conceptions of religion, known as ginans, played a role in the forming of a new ethnic caste-like grouping. This group came to be known as Khojas (from Khawaja), a title given by Sadardin, that would predominantly merge into what is now understood as the Nizari Ismaili branch of Shia Islam. In 1422, Jam Rai Dan was tribal leader in Sindh during the Samma Dynasty; he was converted to Islam by Sayad Eusuf-ud-Din and he adopted a new name Makrab Khan. At that time a person named Mankeji was head of 84 nukhs of Lohanas, who were in favour in court of that Samma king. He was persuaded by ruler and the Qadri to convert to Islam. However, not all Lohanas were ready to convert from Hinduism. But 700 Lohana families comprising some 6,178 persons converted in Thatta, Sindh. These are now known as Memons (from Momins). Diaspora Thousands of Hindu Gujaratis left India between 1880 - 1920 and migrated to British colonies in the African Great Lakes region of Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika.A significant number of these came from the Patidar and Lohana communities. At that time,however, there was already a bustling merchant class diaspora of Gujarati Muslims in these countries. The Lohana migrants to East Africa, of which there were 40,000 in 1970, came mainly from the Saurashtran cities of Jamnagar and Rajkot. Many Lohanas set up businesses in those countries, two of the most successful being those set up by Nanji Kalidas Mehta and Muljibhai Madhvani. In the later part of 20th century, following the independence of British colonies, and particularly after Idi Amin's expulsion order for South Asians in 1972, most Lohanas moved to the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent to United States and Canada. In the UK, the highest concentration of Lohanas and other Gujarati Hindu communities is around the West London suburbs of Wembley and Harrow, and the city of Leicester in the East Midlands region of England.

It is distinguished from other suits by being filed a United States bankruptcy court in connection with a larger bankruptcy proceeding. Procedure Adversary proceedings are governed by certain court rules found in Part VII of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and, in part, by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A bankruptcy case may contain one or more adversary proceedings or (most commonly) none at all. Other than their connection to a bankruptcy proceeding, adversary proceedings are largely similar to a standard lawsuit in federal district court. The suit is opened by a complaint filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and proceeds through the same stages of litigation, including discovery and trial (including jury trial in appropriate cases). The adversary proceeding may address claims to do with federal or state law, or in rare cases other law, as well. The only limitation is that the suit must have some bearing on the liabilities or assets of the bankrupt debtor or the debtor's discharge. Adversary proceedings may be filed by the bankruptcy trustee or by other parties. For example, a creditor may file an adversary proceeding to object to the debtor's discharge. Or, a debtor may commence an adversary proceeding against a creditor as a response to a violation of the automatic stay. Very commonly, the debtor-in-possession in a Chapter 11 reorganization of a business debtor will initiate adversary proceedings against a party with whom the debtor had an executory contract, against whom it had a claim in tort, or to whom it made a preferential transfer prior to filing for bankruptcy, intending to collect funds to maximize working assets.See generally Fed R. Bankr. P. 7001(4). An adversary proceeding is more formal than a contested matter. A contested matter in bankruptcy is governed by Rule 9014 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. A debtor can attempt to discharge student loans through bankruptcy by use of the adversary proceeding.\\"Bankrupt your student loans and other discharge strategies,\\" by Chuck Stewart, Ph.D., .

Goswell, along with Neil Halstead, Ian McCutcheon and former Chapterhouse member Simon Rowe became Mojave 3 when Slowdive transitioned to a more country/folk rock style. She released a solo album in 2004, titled Waves Are Universal on 4AD Records. Early life Goswell was born in Fareham, Hampshire, England. Her family relocated to Wales after her birth, and later to Reading, Berkshire when she was seven, where she spent the remainder of her youth. She is the second of two children, with one older brother. Her father taught her folk guitar songs beginning at age seven, and she began studying classical guitar and music theory at age ten. Goswell took classical guitar lessons along with childhood friend Neil Halstead, with whom she formed Slowdive in 1989.

Career Goswell with Slowdive at the Fox Theater in Oakland, California 2017 Goswell formed the indie rock band The Pumpkin Fairies with Neil Halstead, Adrien Sell and Nick Chaplin in 1988, after having played in several cover bands in Reading. When The Pumpkin Fairies dissolved in 1989, the foursome then formed Slowdive in the same year. She was a member in Slowdive until the band's dissolution in 1995. After the disbandment, Goswell and Halstead formed Mojave 3, an offshoot of Slowdive; the group captured a more folk rock-oriented sound as opposed to Slowdive's shoegaze sound. They released five albums, their last being Puzzles Like You in 2006, before going on a hiatus. The year 2004 saw Goswell release solo recordings with co-writer Joe Light and producer David Naughton. Nine months after Mojave 3 released Spoon and Rafter, she released The Sleep Shelter EP. Waves Are Universal, her first full-length recording, appeared a month later. Tiny Mix Tapes described the record as \\"delicate and well-thought out\\" despite occasionally veering towards \\"the frankly repulsive world of adult contemporary\\" while Pitchfork Media thought the album was \\"warm [and] summery ... agreeable, if not very exciting\\". Stylus Magazine stated that Waves Are Universal is \\"a solid album that could appeal to both fans of [Goswell's] previous work and others\\". In February 2005, a limited edition remix 12\\" (also available as a download) entitled \\"Coastline\\"/\\"Plucked\\" was issued and features two mixes apiece from The Earlies and Ulrich Schnauss. In 2014, Slowdive, with Goswell, reformed for gigs and have declared in interviews that they would be working on new material. The band continue to tour. In 2016 Goswell joined Stuart Braithwaite, Justin Lockey and James Lockey to form the band Minor Victories. Their self-titled debut was released in June 2016 on Fat Possum records. Personal life Goswell was married to Air Cuba's Christopher Andrews from 1994 until 2000. Goswell is partially deaf as a result of labyrinthitis (a viral infection) which occurred in 2006. This left her with chronic tinnitus in one ear and she also had debilitating balance problems which required physiotherapy for a year. As a result, Goswell had to stop playing and touring with Mojave 3. In 2010 Goswell gave birth to a son, Jesse, who has CHARGE syndrome; Jesse is profoundly deaf and has a serious heart condition which resulted in open heart surgery at the age of five months. She is learning British Sign Language and is vocal about the rights of parents of deaf children to have free access to learning sign language. In October 2013 there was a debate in Parliament led by the NDCS (National Deaf Children's Society) where both Rachel and Jesse were mentioned.

After a monthlong residency at Silver Lake's Spaceland club and a label bidding war, they released their self-titled debut on Hollywood Records (2000), produced by Grammy Producer of the Year Rob Cavallo (Green Day, Goo Goo Dolls) and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge (U2, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna). The album garnered critical acclaim and an international cult following, although it was commercially disappointing. AllMusic describes the album and its fate thus: \\"Tsar is a bit of a glam pop/hard rock hidden treasure that still sounds fresh and thrilling years later. Loaded with hooks, humor, and innocent charm, and coming across like the starry-eyed child of Cheap Trick and Sweet . . . [t]he album was an exciting, hook-filled modern power pop record that nobody bought, despite (or perhaps because of) the band's subsequent opening slot on a Duran Duran tour.\\" Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn used the album's opening track, \\"Calling All Destroyers,\\" to score the animated opening sequence of his 2010 action film Super. The band won \\"Local Album of the Year\\" and \\"Local Band of the Year\\" at the L.A. New Times Music Awards. Rock critic Bob Mehr wrote, \\"Every song glistens and glimmers with gargantuan hooks and stadium-size riffs . . . With this irresistibly catchy debut‚Äîand an onstage presence to match‚ÄîTsar is my nominee as the band best equipped to save rock 'n' roll from its postmillennial doldrums.\\" The band performed on the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and Pajama Party. The band's music has also appeared in the TV shows Veronica Mars, Freakylinks, NCIS, Party Down, and the feature film In the Land of Women. The songs \\"Ordinary Gurl\\" and \\"The Girl Who Wouldn't Die\\" were also featured prominently in the movie American Psycho 2. Tsar has toured with the New York Dolls, Social Distortion, Eve 6, the Marvelous 3, Duran Duran, Juliette and the Licks, and Nerfherder. Tsar recorded their followup, Band-Girls-Money, in 2003 with producer David Katznelson (founder of Birdman Records). After leaving Hollywood Records, Tsar released the album on TVT Records in 2005. The title song was included in the soundtrack for the racing games Burnout Revenge and its PSP and DS spin-off Burnout Legends. The band's lineup shifted, with Chuck Byler replacing Steve Coulter on drums and Derrick Forget replacing Jeff Solomon on bass. The band performed in a TV ad for Nestle Crunch Bar and Napster and filmed two videos: \\"The Love Explosion\\" and \\"Band-Girls-Money.\\" The band also appeared on the cover of L.A. Weekly. In late January 2010, Tsar's original lineup (Whalen/Kern/Solomon/Coulter) reunited. They released The Dark Stuff EP on Aderra Records (US) and LoJinx Records (UK/Europe) and shot a video for \\"Police Station.\\" In 2011 Tsar self-released The Drugboy Tapes, a collection of early demos and live performances from 1998. A split 7-inch featuring the Olsen Twins song \\"Pool Party\\" was released by Aderra Records in March 2012.

He is also the owner of the University of Georgia Bulldogs live mascots Uga, a series of successively numbered English bulldogs. Early life Seiler graduated in 1950 from the Porter Military Academy, now the Porter-Gaud School, in Charleston, South Carolina. He earned his bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Georgia (1956 and 1958), where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and the Gridiron Secret Society and a founder of the Order of the Greek Horsemen. Career Armstrong House, home of Bouhan Falligant LLP between 1970 and 2017 Seiler practiced law in Savannah, where he was a senior partner at Bouhan Falligant LLP. In 1973 he served as president of the State Bar of Georgia. He was featured in the true-crime book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil as the lawyer who defended antiques dealer Jim Williams in a murder case. Because of his and Uga's role in the story, Seiler was cast in the movie adaptation of the book as Judge Samuel L. White, who presided over Williams' trial. Jack Thompson portrayed Seiler in the movie.) He has since appeared in two other movies filmed in Savannah, The Legend of Bagger Vance and The Gingerbread Man. His firm's then-office, Armstrong House, was featured, along with other locations in Savannah, in the original 1962 film Cape Fear, starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum.

Daiss calls Seiler a \\"green attorney\\" at the time and not involved in politics himself but one who remembers the old political establishment. \\"One of Bouhan's main strengths was his organization ‚Äì staying in touch with people personally,\\" Seiler is quoted as saying. \\"Those days it was worth being in politics because you could give jobs out.

The family received the first member of the line (today referred to as Uga I) in 1956, when Seiler was a second-year student at the University of Georgia School of Law and newly married to the former Cecelia Gunn. He was given the bulldog by a former beau of Gunn's, who intended to insult Seiler. The new puppy was said to be the grandson of a white bulldog who traveled with the Georgia football team to Pasadena, California, for the 1943 Rose Bowl. On September 29, 1956, the Seilers brought Uga I with them to Sanford Stadium for the first Georgia Bulldogs football home game of the year, against the Florida State Seminoles. Dan Magill, the Sports Information Director for the UGA Athletic Association at the time, took notice of a picture of the dog from that game and suggested to UGA football head coach Wally Butts that Seiler have Uga attend subsequent games as the official team mascot. This began a tradition of Uga or one of his descendants being present at every University of Georgia football game, home and away. His fifth successor, Uga VI, who, like his progenitors, was a pure white bulldog, maintained the tradition from 1999 until his death in 2008 at Seiler's Savannah home. Uga VII replaced Uga VI for the team's highly anticipated 2008 season; however, officials initially questioned the dog's readiness. Uga VII died on November 19, 2009, of congestive heart failure. In its April 28, 1997 issue Sports Illustrated named Uga the nation's best college mascot. Uga has been the only dog allowed in the State Capitol building in Georgia, and summer 2006 was the 50th anniversary of the Uga line. References External links *Bouhan Falligant LLP: Frank W.

She made her first screen appearance during the serial's pilot episode, which was broadcast on 17 January 1988. Sally became the longest running original female cast member. She departed on 3 April 2008. Ritchie earned various awards and nominations for her portrayal of Sally. In February 2013, it was announced that Ritchie would be reprising her role. Sally returned during the episode broadcast on 15 July 2013 with her daughter. They departed on 5 September 2013. Casting Ritchie auditioned for the role of Sally in front of executive producer John Holmes in 1987. Her audition scene was all about strawberry jam and Sally's imaginary friend Milco. Ritchie told Jason Herbison of British magazine All About Soap that she could remember reading Sally's scenes for Holmes, before auditioning for the director who recorded it on video. She added \\"I remember when my mum told me I got the part of Sally. I didn't want her to tell anyone because I was really embarrassed.\\" Holmes revealed Ritchie had stood out among the other actresses auditioning for the role. He said \\"Actors always choose themselves for a role and in this case Kate Ritchie shone head and shoulders above all the rest.\\" During flashbacks to the character's childhood, Sally was played by Chloe Shelsher. In 2008, Ritchie said of her role, \\"I well and truly know the girl that is Sally Fletcher. If only I had realised earlier she wasn't my enemy, she wasn't the embarrassing little sister always trying to spoil my fun but, in fact, the best friend I ever had....In my Logie acceptance speech last year I said Home and Away had always been my constant and the same goes for Sally. We have spent the past 20 years side by side....Sally is a good person. She is the true meaning of the word good, often a quality that goes unnoticed and is most definitely underrated. Sounds crazy, but it is true.\\"Kate Ritchie, \\"Kate Ritchie bids farewell to Home and Away and Sally,\\" Herald Sun (2 April 2008). =Departure and return= After twenty years, Ritchie departed Home and Away and her last episode aired on 3 April 2008. As Farah Farouque wrote, \\"the last episode featuring Sally is a TV moment of note.\\"Farah Farouque, \\"Tribute to dull and dependable Sally,\\" The Age (3 April 2008). On 10 February 2013, it was announced that Ritchie would be reprising her role for \\"a special story arc\\". Of her return, Ritchie stated \\"There will be a wonderful sense of familiarity stepping back into Sally‚Äôs shoes for a while. Summer Bay is a very different place these days and I am looking forward to working with all the fresh faces that have continued to take Home and Away from strength to strength. It will be a good opportunity to catch up with some old mates too! Those cast and crew I worked with for so many years are who I have missed the most.\\" Ritchie said that her decision to reprise her role depended on Sally having a great return story, as she did not want to come back and change sheets. The actress began filming Sally's return on 25 February. A promotional trailer for Sally's return was released on 20 June. It shows Sally returning to Summer Bay and stating that she had to come back, but is afraid to tell anyone why. Sally returned with her daughter on 15 July 2013.

Norma Oryx Soft Point cartridges in plastic holder (producer Norma Precision AB, Sweden) The 9.3√ó62mm (also known as 9.3√ó62mm Mauser) is a rimless, bottlenecked rifle cartridge designed in 1905 by German gunmaker Otto Bock. It is suitable for hunting medium to large game animals in Africa, Europe, and North America. At a typical velocity of 720 m/s (2362 ft/s), its 286 gr (18.5 g) standard load balances recoil and power for effective use at up to about 250m (275 yds). The C.I.P. Maximum Average Pressure (MAP) for the 9.3√ó62mm is . The 9.3√ó62mm was designed to fit into the Mauser 98 bolt-action rifle. European hunters and settlers in Africa often chose military rifles for their reliability and low cost, but colonial governments in Africa fearful of rebellions often banned military-caliber rifles and ammunition. The 9.3√ó62mm was never a military cartridge and so never had this problem. Like their military counterparts, Mauser rifles chambered in 9.3√ó62mm were relatively inexpensive and quite reliable. Because of these factors, 9.3x62mm quickly became popular, and usage of the cartridge became widespread. The 9.3√ó74mmR is a rimmed cartridge that evolved from the 9.3√ó72mmR black powder cartridge. The energy levels of the 9.3√ó62mm and 9.3√ó74mmR cartridges are similar, but the cartridges are unrelated. The rimmed cartridge is slightly longer than the 9.3x62mm, allowing for lower pressure in the case while retaining muzzle velocity and energy. Ammunition The 9.3√ó62mm was first loaded with a bullet at a muzzle velocity of 655 m/s (2,150 ft/s). After World War I some companies increased the velocity to around 730 m/s (2,400 ft/s), and brought out lighter bullets. Rifles set up for the original load must have their sights readjusted to shoot the newer load to point of aim. Adding to the confusion, loads at both velocities are available today. Several European firms load 9.3√ó62mm ammunition, including Lapua, Norma, RUAG Ammotec (RWS), SAKO, and Prvi Partizan (PPU) as well as Denel (PMP) of South Africa, and it is widely available in Africa. In England, Kynoch the well-known cartridge manufacturer, produced ammunition, referring to the 9.3√ó62mm as '9.3mm Mauser'. Typically it was loaded as 'Metal Covered Soft Nose Bullet', with the base marked simply Kynoch 9.3 mm. This is no longer listed by them. Elsewhere In several European countries, the 9.3x62mm remains a popular cartridge for hunting game like moose and wild boar, and it is offered as a standard chambering in rifles from most makers there. The CZ-USA CZ 550 rifle in 9.3x62mm chambering became available in North America in 2002, and both rifle and cartridge are gaining a strong following there, as the cartridge has a slight power edge over the popular .35 Whelen cartridge. In US, several ammunition makers including Federal, Hornady, Nosler, and Swift offer factory-loaded 9.3x62mm sporting ammunition. Since surplus Scandinavian and European Mausers were brought to Canada in 9.3 calibre in the early 1950s, Canadian hunters have used the 9.3√ó62mm cartridge to hunt large game in Canada including bison, all the deer species, and large bears. In recent years, CZ of Czech Republic, as well as SAKO and Tikka of Finland have imported many 9.3x62mm rifles to Canada and US where demand continues to be high. Adequacy The 9.3√ó62mm is considered ideal for hunting the larger and tougher African game species, such as lions, leopards, gemsboks, elands, and wildebeests. Most hunters consider it a viable all- around cartridge comparable to .338 Winchester Magnum, 9.3√ó64mm Brenneke, and .375 H&H; Magnum. The 9.3√ó62mm has taken cleanly every dangerous game species in Africa. Though it is of smaller bore than the legal minimum .375 calibre for dangerous game in most countries, many countries specifically make an exception for the 9.3√ó62mm.Minimum required caliber for hunting AfricaHunting Laws & Rifle Importation NAPHA Namibia Professional Hunting Association The 9.3√ó62mm is considered adequate for European and North American game animals that may become dangerous, such as feral hogs and bears. Sambar hunters in Australia are turning to the 9.3√ó62mm due to Federal Government's 1996 ban on self-loading rifles. Thousands of deer hunters at once needed bolt-action rifles which delivered one-shot knockdown power on Sambar, and the 9.3√ó62mm calibre has proven to be well up to that task.

In some cases, these can be automatically loaded onto portable media players (like iPods) when they are connected to the end-user's computer. By 2011, so-called RSS-narrators appeared, which aggregated text-only news feeds, and converted them into audio recordings for offline listening. The syndicated content an aggregator will retrieve and interpret is usually supplied in the form of RSS or other XML- formatted data, such as RDF/XML or Atom.  History  RSS began in 1999 \\"when it was first introduced by Internet-browser pioneer Netscape\\". In the beginning, RSS was not a user-friendly gadget and it took some years to spread. \\"...RDF-based data model that people inside Netscape felt was too complicated for end users.\\" The rise of RSS began in the early 2000s when the New York Times implemented RSS: \\"One of the first, most popular sites that offered users the option to subscribe to RSS feeds was the New York Times, and the company‚Äôs implementation of the format was revered as the 'tipping point' that cemented RSS‚Äôs position as a de facto standard.\\" \\"In 2005, major players in the web browser market started integrating the technology directly into their products, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple's Safari.\\" As of 2015, according to BuiltWith.com, there were 20,516,036 live websites using RSS. Types Web aggregators gather material from a variety of sources for display in one location. They may additionally process the information after retrieval for individual clients. For instance, Google News gathers and publishes material independent of customers' needs while Awasu is created as an individual RSS tool to control and collect information according to clients' criteria. There are a variety of software applications and components available to collect, format, translate, and republish XML feeds, a demonstration of presentation-independent data. =News aggregation websites= A news aggregator provides and updates information from different sources in a systematized way. \\"Some news aggregator services also provide update services, whereby a user is regularly updated with the latest news on a chosen topic.\\" Websites such as Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast where aggregation is entirely automatic, using algorithms which carry out contextual analysis and group similar stories together, while other sites supplement automatically aggregated news headline RSS feeds from a number of reputable mainstream and alternative news outlets, while including their own articles in a separate section of the website. Some news aggregators offer subscription services to professionals. News aggregation websites began with content selected and entered by humans, while automated selection algorithms were eventually developed to fill the content from a range of either automatically selected or manually added sources. Google News launched in 2002 using automated story selection, but humans could add sources to its search engine, while the older Yahoo News, as of 2005, used a combination of automated news crawlers and human editors. =Web-based feed readers= Web- based feeds readers allow users to find a web feed on the internet and add it to their feed reader. Online feed readers include Bloglines, Feedly, Inoreader, Facebook News Feed, Flipboard, Digg, News360, My Yahoo!, NewsBlur, Netvibes, Tiny Tiny RSS, and Journali.sm. These are meant for personal use and are hosted on remote servers. Because the application is available via the web, it can be accessed anywhere by a user with an internet connection. There are even more specified web-based RSS readers. For instance, a news aggregator created for scientists: \\"Michael Imbeault, an HIV researcher at the Universit√© Laval in Quebec, launched his fully automated site called \\"e! Science News\\". More advanced methods of aggregating feeds are provided via Ajax coding techniques and XML components called web widgets. Ranging from full-fledged applications to small fragments of source code that can be integrated into larger programs, they allow users to aggregate OPML files, email services, documents, or feeds into one interface. Many customizable homepage and portal implementations provide such functionality. In addition to aggregator services mainly for individual use, there are web applications that can be used to aggregate several blogs into one. One such variety‚Äîcalled planet sites‚Äîare used by online communities to aggregate community blogs in a centralized location. They are named after the Planet aggregator, a server application designed for this purpose. =Feed reader applications= Feed aggregation applications are installed on a PC, smartphone or tablet computer and designed to collect news and interest feed subscriptions and group them together using a user-friendly interface. The graphical user interface of such applications often closely resembles that of popular e-mail clients, using a three-panel composition in which subscriptions are grouped in a frame on the left, and individual entries are browsed, selected, and read in frames on the right. Some notable examples include NetNewsWire, Flipboard, Prismatic, and Zite. Software aggregators can also take the form of news tickers which scroll feeds like ticker tape, alerters that display updates in windows as they are refreshed, web browser macro tools or as smaller components (sometimes called plugins or extensions), which can integrate feeds into the operating system or software applications such as a web browser. Clients applications include Mozilla Thunderbird, Microsoft Office Outlook, iTunes, FeedDemon and many others. = Social news aggregators = One of the examples of social news aggregators is Digg.com. The website collects the most popular stories on the Internet, selected and edited and proposed by a wide range of people. \\"In these social news aggregators, users submit news items (referred to as \\"stories\\"), communicate with peers through direct messages and comments, and collaboratively select and rate submitted stories to get to a real-time compilation of what is currently perceived as \\"hot\\" and popular on the Internet.\\" Social news aggregators based on engagement of community. Their responses, engagement level, and contribution to stories create the content and determine what will be generated as RSS feed. = Frame- and media bias- aware news aggregators = Media bias and Framing (social sciences) are concepts that fundamentally explain deliberate or accidental differences in news coverage. A simple example is a coverage of media in two countries, which are in (armed) conflict with another: one can easily imagine that news outlets, particularly if state-controlled, will report differently or even contrarily on the same events (see for instance Ukrainian crisis). While media bias and framing have been subject to manual research for a couple of decades in the social sciences, only recently automated methods and systems have been proposed to analyze and show such differences. Such systems make use of text- features, e.g., NewsCube is a news aggregator that extracts key phrases that describe a topic differently, or other features, e.g., matrix-based news aggregation spans a matrix over two dimensions, such as in which articles have been published (first dimension) and on which country they are reporting (second dimension).Felix Hamborg, Norman Meuschke, and Bela Gipp, Matrix-based News Aggregation: Exploring Different News Perspectives in Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), 2017.Felix Hamborg, Norman Meuschke and Bela Gipp, Bias-aware News Analysis using Matrix-based News Aggregation in the International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL), 2018. Media aggregators Media aggregators are sometimes referred to as podcatchers due to the popularity of the term podcast used to refer to a web feed containing audio or video. Media aggregators are client software or web- based applications which maintain subscriptions to feeds that contain audio or video media enclosures. They can be used to automatically download media, playback the media within the application interface, or synchronize media content with a portable media player. Multimedia aggregators are the current focus. EU launched the project Reveal This to embedded different media platforms in RSS system. \\"Integrated infrastructure that will allow the user to capture, store, semantically index, categorize and retrieve multimedia, and multilingual digital content across different sources ‚Äì TV, radio, music, web, etc. The system will allow the user to personalize the service and will have semantic search, retrieval, summarization.\\" Broadcatching \\"Broadcatching is a promising mechanism to improve the experience of BitTorrent users by automatically downloading files advertised through RSS feeds.\\" Several BitTorrent client software applications such as Azureus and ŒºTorrent have added the ability to broadcatch torrents of distributed multimedia through the aggregation of web feeds. Broadcatching is the ervise for smart TV era. \\"Broadcatching is the act of downloading TV to be viewed on your computer.\\" Files downloaded from BitTorrent have to be read by special screening tool DiVX. Feed filtering One of the problems with news aggregators is that the volume of articles can sometimes be overwhelming, especially when the user has many web feed subscriptions. As a solution, many feed readers allow users to tag each feed with one or more keywords which can be used to sort and filter the available articles into easily navigable categories. Another option is to import the user's Attention Profile to filter items based on their relevance to the user's interests.  RSS and marketing  Some bloggers predicted the death of RSS when Google Reader was shut down. Later, however, RSS was considered more of a success as an appealing way to obtain information. \\"Feedly, likely the most popular RSS reader today, has gone from around 5,000 paid subscribers in 2013 to around 50,000 paid subscribers in early 2015 ‚Äì that‚Äôs a 900% increase for Feedly in two years.\\" Customers use RSS to get information more easily while businesses take advantages of being able to spread announcements. \\"RSS serves as a delivery mechanism for websites to push online content to potential users and as an information aggregator and filter for users.\\" However, it has been pointed out that in order to push the content RSS should be user-friendly to ensure proactive interaction so that the user can remain engaged without feeling \\"trapped\\", good design to avoid being overwhelmed by stale data, and optimization for both desktop and mobile use. RSS has a positive impact on marketing since it contributes to better search engine rankings, to building and maintaining brand awareness, and increasing site traffic.

George Archer-Shee (6 May 1895 - 31 October 1914) was a Royal Navy cadet whose case of whether he stole a five shilling postal order was decided in the High Court of Justice in 1910. Archer-Shee was successfully defended by barrister and politician Sir Edward Carson. The trial, which became a British cause c√©l√®bre, was the inspiration for the 1946 Terence Rattigan play The Winslow Boy, which has been the basis of two films. Following his acquittal, the boy's family were paid compensation in July 1911. Archer-Shee was commissioned in the British Army in 1913, and killed aged 19, at the First Battle of Ypres on 31 October 1914. Family George Archer-Shee was the son of Martin Archer-Shee and his second wife Helen Treloar. His father was an official at the Bank of England and grandson of the painter Sir Martin Archer Shee. His half-brother was Martin Archer-Shee, an army officer and Member of Parliament. Actor Robert Bathurst is his great nephew. Theft Osborne House's former stable block was the Naval College's main building. In January 1908 Archer-Shee became a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The college, which was part of the estate of the late Queen Victoria, educated and trained 14- to 16-year-olds in their first two years of officer training for a career in the Royal Navy. Further studies then continued at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in Devon. The theft occurred on 7 October 1908, shortly after the start of the autumn term, when a cadet named Terence Hugh Back received a postal order from a relative for five shillings. On the same afternoon, Archer-Shee had been given permission to go to a post office outside the college grounds to buy a postal order and a stamp because he wanted to buy a model train costing fifteen shillings and sixpence (15s 6d). On returning to the college, he discovered that Back had reported that his postal order had been stolen. Miss Tucker, the elderly clerk at Osborne Post Office, was contacted. She produced Back's cashed postal order and stated that only two cadets had visited her that afternoon. However, she claimed the same cadet who had bought a postal order for 15s 6d was also the one who cashed the 5s order. Legal defence The postal order Archer-Shee was accused of cashing. The postal order which Archer-Shee indisputably bought. When the Admiralty wrote to Archer-Shee's father telling him that his son was being expelled for theft, his father instantly responded that \\"Nothing will make me believe the boy guilty of this charge, which shall be sifted by independent experts\\". The father's reaction reflected the family's values. They were devout Roman Catholics and the background in banking meant all the sons had been brought up to regard misuse of money as sinful. Martin Archer-Shee contacted several lawyers to help clear his son's name. He also contacted his son Major Martin Archer-Shee, the half brother of George, who was active in politics (in 1910 he became Member of Parliament for Finsbury Central in North London). Major Archer-Shee obtained the services of Sir Edward Carson, regarded as one of the United Kingdom's best barristers of the age, who had a son at Osborne. Before he took the case, Carson subjected the boy to questioning to test his story, only accepting once he had satisfied himself of the boy's innocence. Trial and acquittal Several problems prevented Carson from taking the case straight to court. Firstly as Archer-Shee was a naval cadet at the time, this excluded him from the jurisdiction of a civil court. Secondly as he was not enlisted in the Royal Navy, he was not entitled to a court-martial. In order to help his client, Carson brought a petition of right against the Crown to bring the matter before the courts. The case eventually came to the High Court of Justice on 26 July 1910. The Solicitor-General, Sir Rufus Isaacs, appeared for the Crown and Carson, himself a former Solicitor-General, for Archer-Shee. Carson's opening remarks set the tone of the case: Carson soon proved that the grounds on which the Admiralty had dismissed Archer-Shee were unsubstantiated. The barrister successfully proved that the elderly postmistress, Miss Tucker, could easily have been mistaken. She admitted in court that all of the cadets looked alike, conceding that in the course of dealing with one cadet and her various other tasks and duties, another boy could have entered without her noticing. The court also heard Miss Tucker was unable to identify Archer-Shee among the other cadets when given the opportunity to do so. On the fourth day of the trial, the Solicitor-General accepted the statement that George Archer- Shee did not cash the postal order \\"and consequently that he is innocent of the charge. I say further, in order that there may be no misapprehension about it, that I make that statement without any reserve of any description, intending that it shall be a complete justification of the statement of the boy and the evidence he has given before the court.\\" Compensation Following the verdict, the Archer-Shee family began to press the Admiralty to pay restitution. On 16 March 1911 the First Lord of the Admiralty said that he thought the House of Commons would think it inappropriate. Nevertheless, the family continued to press their claim, circulating a booklet within the Establishment presenting their side of the case. On 6 April, the Archer-Shee case was raised in the Commons during a Naval Estimates debate. As most MPs supported compensation, the Admiralty was forced to concede to a judicial hearing to decide the matter, otherwise the business would be 'lost' (a Parliamentary term meaning postponed, not dismissed, to a future day). Following the hearing, John Charles Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey agreed the family should be paid ¬£4,120 to cover their costs, and ¬£3,000 compensation \\"in full settlement of all demands\\" (equivalent to ¬£ in ). All monies were paid in July 1911. Later life After his expulsion as a naval cadet in 1908, Archer-Shee returned to the Roman Catholic Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, where he had been educated before going to Osborne Naval College. After completing his studies, he went to work at the Wall Street firm of Fisk & Robinson in New York. Having been a cadet sergeant in the Officers' Training Corps at Stonyhurst, he joined the British Army Special Reserve of Officers in 1913.The London Gazette Publication date: 2 May 1913 Issue: 28715 Page: 3152The London Gazette Publication date: 9 December 1913 Issue:28780 Page: 9085 With the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Archer-Shee returned to Britain and served as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. It was the same regiment that Sir Edward Carson's nephew Francis Robinson had joined shortly before. Archer-Shee was killed, aged 19, at the First Battle of Ypres in October 1914. His name is inscribed on the war memorial in the village of North Woodchester in Gloucestershire, where his parents lived. His name also appears on the roll of honour of \\"the men of St Mary‚Äôs school and congregation\\" displayed on the wall at the front of the Roman Catholic church of St Mary on the Quay, Bristol.Image of Bristol, St Mary on the Quay War Memorial Robinson was killed three days before Archer-Shee.

As its title indicates, Transition was a bridge between classic quartet recordings like A Love Supreme and the more experimental works of Coltrane's last years. For some reason, Impulse! decided to alter the track listing of the original album on the CD edition, removing \\"Dear Lord\\" and replacing it with two pieces originally released on Kulu S√© Mama \\"Welcome\\" and \\"Vigil\\". However, the 2001 Japanese edition restored the original track listing. Coltrane's playing alternates between blues idioms and the free jazz that would dominate his final work. Of the four musicians on this album, pianist McCoy Tyner was still the most grounded in traditional jazz. Bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones were finding new ways to approach their instruments, while Coltrane took the lead with a newfound musical freedom. Transition's title track is a fifteen- minute modified blues, whilst \\"Dear Lord\\" is a ballad featuring Roy Haynes substituting for Jones on drums. \\"Welcome,\\" which replaces \\"Dear Lord\\" on the album's compact disc release, is a five-minute ballad with a theme pitched high in the tenor saxophone's altissimo register and making extensive use of multiphonics.

Etymology Nasi uduk literally means \\"mixed rice\\" in Betawi dialect, related with Indonesian term aduk (\\"mix\\"). The name describes the dish preparation itself which requires more ingredients (coconut milk, clove, lemongrass, cinnamon, and pandan leaf) than cooking common steamed rice and additional side dishes. Preparation Nasi uduk is made by cooking rice soaked in coconut milk instead of water, along with clove, cassia bark, and lemongrass to add aroma. Sometimes knotted pandan leaves are thrown into the rice while steaming to give it more fragrance. The coconut milk and spices imparts an oily, rich taste to the rice. Bawang goreng (fried shallots) is sprinkled on top of the rice before serving. Other dishes are usually served as side dishes. Pre-packed nasi uduk are commonly wrapped in a cone-shaped banana leaf. Side dishes Nasi uduk with empal fried beef, semur jengkol and krechek (beef rind in spicy coconut milk) Traditional Betawi nasi uduk, mixing all the side dishes on the nasi uduk plate, such as egg, tempeh, sambal, bihun goreng, and krupuk Packed nasi uduk with ayam suwir (shredded chicken), slices of cucumber, shredded omelette, and tempe orek (tempeh stir fried with soy sauce) Nasi uduk sold in warung or other eating establishments are commonly offered with assortment of side dishes, chosen by the client. The pre-packed basic nasi uduk usually consists of tempe orek (tempeh stir fried with sweet soy sauce), teri kacang (anchovy with peanuts), and shredded omelette, with sambal kacang (peanut sambal). Side dishes offered with nasi uduk are: * Tempe orek (tempeh stir fried with vegetables and soy sauce) * Eggs such as ceplok (fried egg), omelette, shredded omelette, telur balado (hard boiled egg in sambal sauce), and telur pindang * Teri kacang (anchovy with peanuts) * Bihun goreng (fried rice vermicelli) * Tumis buncis (stir fried common beans) * Krechek (beef rind (similar to pork rind) in spicy coconut milk) * Ayam goreng (fried chicken) * Jeroan (offals, including tripe, cow lungs, liver and gizzards) * Empal (fried beef) * Semur daging (beef stew in sweet soy sauce) * Semur tahu (tofu stew in sweet soy sauce) * Semur jengkol (jengkol bean stew in sweet soy sauce) * Gorengan (fritters) such as fried tempeh, tofu, or bakwan (chopped vegetable fritters), perkedel kentang (potato patties) or perkedel jagung (corn fritter) * Emping (melinjo chips or krupuk bawang (onion cracker)) The most common type of sambal that usually served with nasi uduk is sambal kacang (peanut sambal); it is optional as a condiment. Popularity Nasi uduk is a popular dish for the busy commuters in Jakarta, mainly because it is affordable (one serving costs on average Rp10,000 or about US$0.77). It can be found throughout the day; some roadside stalls open exclusively in the morning, noon, or night, depending on the demographics of the surrounding area. Stalls near residential areas, marketplaces, train stations, and schools are usually open from morning to noon, while the ones near offices and street-side are usually open afternoon to midnight. Variants Each neighbourhood in Jakarta has its own variant of the dish, the most notable being Nasi uduk Slipi from West Jakarta. Kebon Kacang area near Tanah Abang in Central Jakarta is renowned for its nasi uduk. The dish is known as berkat (literally: \\"blessing\\") in Suriname. There are similar dishes in Riau and Riau islands (Sumatera), Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and Southern Thailand called nasi lemak. Another slightly different dish is nasi ulam.

A letter from Clara to Nathanael, explaining that Nathanael had addressed the previous letter to her instead of to Lothar. She was touched at the account of Nathanael's childhood trauma, and discussed it with Lothar, but she is convinced that the terrors are of Nathanael's own imagining and urges him to put Coppelius/Coppola out of his mind. 3\\\\. A letter from Nathanael to Lothar, in which Nathanael declares that Coppola is not, after all, Coppelius: Coppola is clearly Italian, while Coppelius was German, and Coppola is also vouched for by the new physics professor, Spallanzani, who is also Italian and has known Coppola for years. Nathanael adds that Spallanzani has a daughter, Olimpia, a brief glimpse of whom has made a considerable impression upon him. Shortly after this third letter, Nathanael returns to his home town from his studies to see Clara and Lothar, and in the joy of their reunion Coppelius/Coppola is at first forgotten. Nevertheless, the encounter with Coppola has had a profound effect on Nathanael, driving him toward a gloomy mysticism which bores Clara and leads to their gradual estrangement. He writes a poem about Coppelius destroying his happiness in love, in which Coppelius appears at his wedding to touch Clara's eyes and then throws Nathanael into a circle of fire. After he emotionally reads this poem to her, she tells him to throw the insane poem into the fire. Nathanael's frustration with this leads him to call her an \\"inanimate, accursed automaton\\", which so enrages Lothar that he in turn insults Nathanael, and a duel is only narrowly averted by Clara's intervention. Nathanael pleads for Clara's forgiveness, and declares his true love for her, and the three then reconcile. Nathanael returns to complete the final year of his studies, after which he intends to return to his hometown forever. He finds his student lodgings destroyed by fire, though his possessions were rescued by his friends and moved to a new house which is opposite that of Spallanzani. His window now looks directly into that of Olimpia, and he is again struck by her beauty. Coppola calls to sell his wares, and offers \\"pretty eyes, pretty eyes!\\" which reawakens Nathanael's childish fear of the Sandman. However, it turns out that Coppola has lenses and spectacles to sell, and also small telescopes, and Nathanael buys one of these from him to set matters right after his earlier outburst. As Coppola leaves, Nathanael becomes fixated on watching Olimpia through his telescope, although her fixed gaze and motionless stance disconcert him. Spallanzani gives a grand party at which it is reported that his daughter will be presented in public for the first time. Nathanael is invited, and becomes enraptured by Olimpia, who plays the harpsichord, sings and dances. Her stiffness of movement and coldness of touch appear strange to many of the company. Nathanael dances with her repeatedly, awed by her perfect rhythm, and eventually tells her of his passion for her, to which Olimpia replies only \\"Ah, ah!\\". During the following days, he visits Olimpia repeatedly, reading her the poems and mysticism that had so bored Clara, and Olimpia listens to it all and replies only \\"Ah, ah!\\", which Nathanael interprets as understanding. Most other people consider her dull and stupid, although pretty, and with strangely mechanical actions. Eventually Nathanael determines to propose to Olimpia, but when he arrives at her rooms he finds an argument in progress between Spallanzani and Coppola, who are fighting over the body of Olimpia and arguing over who made the eyes and who made the clockwork. Coppola, who is now revealed as Coppelius in truth, wins the struggle, and makes off with the lifeless and eyeless body, while the injured Spallanzani urges Nathanael to chase after him and recover the automaton to which he has devoted so many years of his life. The sight of Olimpia's eyes lying on the ground drives Nathanael to madness, and he flies at the professor to strangle him. He is pulled away by other people drawn by the noise of the struggle, and in a state of insanity, is taken to an asylum. Spallanzani recovers from the encounter, but is forced to leave the university because of the sensational revelation of the trick he had played in trying to pass off an automaton as a living person. Coppelius once more vanishes without trace. The narrator adds that the story of the automaton had a widespread effect on society, with many lovers taking steps to ensure they were not enamoured of puppets but of real flesh and blood. Nathanael appears to recover from his madness and is reunited with Clara and Lothar. He resolves to marry Clara and move to a pleasant estate near his home town. On the way to visit the place, they pass through the town and climb the high steeple to look out at the view. Clara points out a bush that seems to be striding towards them. Nathanael automatically withdraws Coppola's spyglass and, looking through it sideways, sees Clara through the lens. With Clara in place of Olimpia as the subject of the spyglass's gaze, madness strikes Nathanael again, and he tries to hurl Clara from the steeple. She is saved by Lothar, but in the crowd that gathers below Coppelius appears, and upon seeing him Nathanael cries \\"pretty eyes, pretty eyes!\\" and leaps over the railing to his death. Coppelius disappears into the crowd. Many years afterward, the narrator concludes, it is said that Clara was seen with a kind- looking man sitting before a country house with two lovely boys, and thus found the domestic happiness that Nathanael could never have provided. Characters * Nathanael (the gift of God): narcissistic protagonist with a manic sense of mission. * Clara (the light one): Nathanael's fianc√©e with a peaceful, judicious, yet determined temperament. * Lothar: Clara's brother and Nathanael's friend. * Nathanael's father: alchemical experimentalist whose dealings with Coppelius during Nathanael's childhood lead to his death. * Coppelius: Fear-instilling, large and malformed man who spoiled the happiness of Nathanael and his siblings in their childhood and may be implicated in the death of Nathanael's father. * Coppola: Italian trader in barometers and lenses, in whom Nathanael recognizes Coppelius. * Spallanzani: physics professor with whom Nathanael is studying, and collaborator with Coppola on building the lifelike automaton Olimpia. * Olimpia (\\"she who comes from Olympus\\" in the Classical context): \\"Daughter\\" of Nathanael's professor, Spallanzani, who is later revealed to be an automaton, or robot; this revelation is one of the elements that incites Nathanael's madness. * Siegmund (protection): Attempts to save his friend Nathanael from unhappiness and insanity. Folklore references The story contains an example of a horrific depiction of the folklore character, the Sandman, who is traditionally said to throw sand in the eyes of children to help them fall asleep. The following excerpt is from an English translation of the story: > Most curious to know more of this Sandman and his particular connection with > children, I at last asked the old woman who looked after my youngest sister > what sort of man he was. 'Eh, Natty', said she, 'don't you know that yet? He > is a wicked man, who comes to children when they won't go to bed, and throws > a handful of sand into their eyes, so that they start out bleeding from > their heads. He puts their eyes in a bag and carries them to the crescent > moon to feed his own children, who sit in the nest up there. They have > crooked beaks like owls so that they can pick up the eyes of naughty human > children.' English translation by John Oxenford Interpretations The characters and the conflict are first defined in the story's three opening letters. Furthermore, the psychological conflict of the protagonist, Nathanael, is represented, who is torn between hallucinations and reality. Nathanael struggles his whole life against posttraumatic stress which comes from a traumatic episode with the sandman in his childhood experience. Until the end of the book it remains open whether this experience was real, or just a dream of the young Nathanael. The text clearly leaves the decision open in as much as it offers two understandings: that of Nathanael's belief that there is a dark power controlling him, and Clara's postulation (together with Lothar) against this that this is only a psychological element. The story is partly a subjective description of the proceedings from Nathanael's viewpoint which, due to enormous psychological problems, is not likely objectiveor possibly objectively portrayed. Hoffman consciously leaves the reader unsure. In this, the interpretation from an Enlightenment perspective makes sense against the Romantic view, whereby Klara represents the enlightenment and Nathanael the Romantics. Of central importance is the \\"eyes\\" theme (interpreted by Freud in his 1919 essay, The Uncanny, as fear of castration), the \\"steps\\", the robot, and laughing. Hoffman, well known for not conforming to society, manages to give a satirical critique of society here, which offers a lesson to both Enlightened scientists and Romantic \\"hoverers and floaters\\". The Coppelius/Coppola character can be considered not as a real physical character, but as a metaphor, like Nathanael does when he returns home. He represents the dark side within Nathanael. Note that the fight between Spallanzani and one or both of them for the \\"wooden doll\\" where we hear Coppelius's voice but see Coppola. There is also the motif of fists, where Coppelius is always described as having fists, but never hands.

Reinhart Joseph W. Reinhart (1851-1911) was the twelfth president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. He served as head of the Santa Fe from December 1893 until August 1894. Biography =Early years= Joseph W. Reinhart was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 15, 1851. He was a graduate of Western University of Pennsylvania, today known as the University of Pittsburgh. =Career= Following graduation, Reinhart entered the field of railroad management, beginning in 1875 as a clerk in the office of a division superintendent of the Allegheny Valley Railroad. Thus began a career in which Reinhart worked for more than 20 railroads. Reinhart ascended to the Santa Fe's presidency on December 23, 1893, when he was appointed a receiver of the railroad along with John J. McCook and Joseph C. Wilson. He had competed for the presidency with Albert Alonzo Robinson, the railroad's vice president and general manager, but Reinhart's connections in financial circles made him the ultimate winner of this battle. Reinhart's own statements to the press in the previous year about the railroad's financial health would prove to be his downfall. Right up until he announced the receivership, Reinhart had been issuing reports of a highly profitable financial situation. He pointed out that the railroad's revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, were more than $16 million, which was $1 million more than the previous year. However, with that amount in revenues, the railroad was barely able to cover the interest on its debts and collapsed with the death of its chairman George C. Magoun. The press needed someone to blame and quickly centered on Reinhart as the issuer of the glowing statements of solvency as little as six months previous. Investigations were begun and it was soon found that executives in as many as the past seven years had juggled the company's accounts so that by the summer of 1894, the railroad's actual debt in the previous years had at least equalled its revenues, leaving the company's net worth at zero. Reinhart vehemently denied these new reports, but after further posturing and an indictment for violating the Interstate Commerce Act, Reinhart resigned from the railroad on August 8, 1894. =Death and legacy= Reinhart died at his home in Kansas City, Missouri on January 27, 1911.\\"Former President of Santa Fe is Dead,\\" Topeka Daily Capital, Jan. 28, 1911, pg. 1. He was 59 years old at the time of his death, which was attributed to pneumonia and bronchitis which followed a severe cold which he caught in New York City two weeks previously. At the time of his death, Reinhart was serving as the President of the Kansas City Viaduct and Terminal Company.

In reality, a party may be \\"necessary\\" but not indispensable. For example, if they claim an interest in the litigation, that interest may be impeded if they are not joined. That doesn't transform him them into an indispensable party unless their absence threatens some other party's interest. Often, an indispensable party is any party whose rights are directly affected by disposition of the case. Many jurisdictions have rules which provide for an indispensable party to be joined (brought into the case as a party) at the discretion of the judge. In some cases, the inability to join such a party means that the case must be dismissed. In the United States, this is outlined in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 19. Identifying an indispensable party The indispensable party is often a prudential standing requirement. That is, while the parties currently involved in litigation have an actual case or controversy, judges will not proceed without the indispensable party. This avoids potential double litigation and possibly inequitable outcomes. In determining whether a party is indispensable, courts generally look to three factors: # Will the missing party's interests be harmed in some direct way by the outcome of the case? # Does the missing party have an interest which would cause another party to the case to be subjected to multiple obligations? # Can the court provide complete relief to the plaintiff without the presence of the missing party? In patent law, for example, a patent owner is an indispensable party to a patent infringement suit brought by an exclusive licensee against an alleged infringer. The patent owner's rights would be directly affected by a finding of invalidity or unenforceability of the patent claims. At the same time, if the patent owner is not a party to the case, the alleged infringer could be sued separately by the patent owner, and could end up having to pay two judgments for the same act of infringement. Determining the feasibility of joining an indispensable party Once it has been determined that a missing party is indispensable, the court must determine whether it is feasible to join that party to the case. In making this determination, the court will use the same analysis that it uses to determine whether it has jurisdiction over any party. First, it must determine whether it can exercise personal jurisdiction over the party. Second, it must determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction will affect its subject matter jurisdiction. In diversity cases, which brought in federal court on the basis of all plaintiffs coming from different states as all defendants, joinder will not be deemed feasible if it destroys diversity. Where the missing party can not be brought into the case, the court must determine whether it is possible to proceed without joining that party. If it is not possible to proceed, the case will be dismissed. In some jurisdictions, the failure to join an indispensable party does not hinder the case. For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia does not recognize the doctrine of indispensable parties; although a defendant may argue that the plaintiff has improperly failed to join a party that would conventionally be deemed indispensable, and may seek to have the court attempt to join the missing party, if it is not feasible to join the missing party then the case will simply go on without them.

It is administratively part of Plovdiv Province and has a population of about 30,340 (), the mayor being Dr. Emil Kabaivanov. Karlovo is famous for the worldwide-known rose oil, which is grown there and used in producing perfume.

There is a museum and large monument dedicated to him. Karlovo is also a popular location for tourism in the region. During the 2000s, Bulgarian archaeologists made discoveries in Central Bulgaria which were summarized as 'The Valley of the Thracian Kings'. On 19 August 2005, some archaeologists announced they had found the first Thracian capital, which was situated near Karlovo in Bulgaria. Many polished ceramic artifacts (pieces of roof-tiles and Greek-like vases) were discovered revealing the fortune of the town.

While songs have been arranged since the group's mid-century inception, many songs \\"die\\" from the active repertoire to make way for new arrangements. As a result, the most successful and well-arranged songs from each generation remain with the group as it progresses forward, leaving the undergraduate group with a repertoire of songs representing all decades in fairly equal proportions. The most performed of these songs is probably the Tigertones' arrangement of \\"Shower the People\\" by James Taylor. Performances and tours The Tigertones sing regularly for private parties, corporate-sponsored events, and charity functions primarily in the Northeast (NYC, Philadelphia, Boston). Several times a year, they embark on week-long tours that take them to domestic locations (San Francisco, Orlando, Atlanta) and abroad (Bermuda, Japan, UAE, China and the United Kingdom). In October 2017, they performed at the prestigious Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet in London as part of their week-long tour of the city. Attire The Tigertones perform at events ranging from the ultra-informal (\\"arch sings\\" in the arches on Princeton's campus) to the very formal (Carnegie Hall, American Embassy in Tokyo). As a result, the Tigertones have adopted several styles of performance attire, the most notable being \\"Coat and Tie\\" (a blue blazer, khaki pants, and tie; medium formality and the most common) and the Tigertones' signature \\"DJ\\" (a full tuxedo with white dinner jacket, reserved only for important performances, and the attire used for publicity photos and CD inserts).The Tigertones' 2005 appearance in white dinner jackets, at the U.S. consulate in D√ºsseldorf, is pictured here , also the July 4, 2007 performance at the U.S. Embassy in Bern, Switzerland, is seen here Notable alumni *Hutch Parker: Film executive *Andrew Jarecki: Executive and co-founder of 777-FILM *Wentworth Miller: Actor/screenwriter *William R.

Frequently, civil cases are bifurcated into separate liability and damages proceedings. Criminal trials are also often bifurcated into guilt and sentencing phases, especially in capital cases. In divorce cases, some states allow bifurcation, that permits a divorce case to be finalized with certain aspects, such as property, to be dealt with after dissolution. Some states permit bifurcation, some do not allow it, and some state statutes do not address the issue. In arbitration, bifurcation can be used to get past certain issues, that might otherwise stall negotiations, concluding certain points that are agreed upon, while working on a solution to whatever problem initiated the need for bifurcation.  Bifurcation under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  In Federal Court, judges have wide discretion to structure trials. Factors evaluated will include congruence of issues, complexity for the jury, and possible prejudice to any of the parties. American Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 42(b) allows the court to decide issues contained in separate trials.  Bifurcation under state procedure  State procedures differ widely. In some states, a defendant who has raised the defense of mental disease or defect will automatically create a bifurcated trial. In the first stage of the trial, both sides present evidence and testimony designed to establish that the defendant is either guilty or not guilty. If the defendant is guilty, the issue of mental disease is presented.  Bifurcation in divorce  States have historically taken different views on bifurcation but most state statutes do not address the subject. Alaska permits the courts, under certain circumstances, to divide the parties' property \\"at any time after the judgment\\". Alaska Stat. 25.24.155(b) and Alaska Stat. 25.24.160 (Michie 1996). Michigan law, Mich. Ct. R. 3.211(B)(3) (1998) directs that a judgment of divorce must include a determination of the parties' property rights. The New Jersey Supreme Court, in Frankel v. Frankel, 274 N.J. Super. 585, 644 A.2d 1132 (App. Div. 1994), prohibits bifurcation except in the most unusual and extenuating circumstances. Some states, by law, preclude bifurcation. The Nebraska Nebraska Supreme Court, held that all issues must be resolved at the time of dissolution, and in Humphrey v. Humphrey, 214 Neb. 664, 340 N.W.2d 381 (1983), concluded, \\"Whatever personal convenience a court may confer on parties by granting an immediate dissolution while retaining property jurisdiction cannot be worth the difficulties and problems to which the trial court is exposing the litigants.\\". The Arizona Supreme Court, in Porter v. Estate of Pigg, 175 Ariz. 303, 856 P.2d 796 (1993), held that bifurcation to \\"resolve issues of marriage dissolution and property distribution is error\\", and in Brighton v. Superior Court, 22 Ariz. App. 291, 526 P.2d 1089 (1974), that bifurcation would fostered rather than deter litigation. A Texas Court of Appeals, Adam v. Stewart, 552 S.W.2d 536 (Tex. Civ. App. 1977), disapproved of bifurcation. The Third Department of New York's Appellate Division, Busa v. Busa, 196 A.D.2d 267, 609 N.Y.S.2d 452 (1994), Sullivan v. Sullivan, 174 A.D.2d 862, 571 N.Y.S.2d 154 (1991), and Garcia v. Garcia, 178 A.D.2d 683, 577 N.Y.S.2d 156 (1991), held that a divorce decree is nonbinding and without legal effect if including bifurcation and without making an award of equitable distribution at the time of dissolution, while the Fourth Department, Zack v. Zack, 183 A.D.2d 382, 590 N.Y.S.2d 632 (1992), rejected these decisions supported by Johnson, 172 Misc. 2d 684, 658 N.Y.S.2d 780 (Sup.

The American Arbitration Association (AAA), the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) rules allow for bifurcation, while the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) rules don't address the issue.Use of bifurcation ‚Äì Retrieved 2012-03-10  References  Category:Legal procedure Category:Judgment (law) ","title":"Bifurcation (law)"},{"id":"2351775","text":"Maloyaroslavets () is a town and the administrative center of Maloyaroslavetsky District in Kaluga Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of the Luzha River (Oka's basin), northeast of Kaluga, the administrative center of the oblast.

He was the third governor of West Virginia from 1869 until 1871.http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/1129.html William Erskine Stevenson Early and family life William was the son of Irish immigrants, and was born in Warren, Pennsylvania. His parents, James and Elizabeth (Erskine) Stevenson, had immigrated to America in 1817. In 1829 James moved his young family to Pittsburgh to work as a cabinet-maker. William apprenticed at his father's trade, then went into business for himself. In September 1842 he married Sarah Clotworthy, another second generation American whose parents came from Belfast, Ireland.\\"West Virginia's First Ladies,\\" West Virginia Division of Culture and History, June 2007. Career Largely self- educated, Stevenson began his interest in politics as a labor spokesman. He was associated with the Pittsburgh unit of the National Reform Association, and advocated the ten-hour workday. He became an adherent of the new Republican Party, and shared in their early success by being elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1857. However, later that same year he bought a small farm and moved to Wood County in western Virginia. Stevenson remained an advocate of labor and also supported continuing the union. As the American Civil War grew closer, a warrant was issued for his arrest in 1859. He was accused of sedition against the state for circulating a book, \\"The Impending Crisis of the South\\" by Hinton Rowan Helper, that criticized slavery. Hoping to make a case for the freedom of ideas, Stevenson attempted to surrender to the Wood County sheriff, who declined to arrest him. But, from this point forward, he became a militant anti-slavery and pro-union activist. In 1860 Stevenson was a delegate to the Republican national convention in Chicago. At home, he campaigned for Abraham Lincoln. When war finally came, Stevenson became an outspoken advocate to the creation of the state of West Virginia. He was a delegate for Wood County in the constitutional conventions of 1862 and 1863. When the second of these successfully withdrew from Virginia and statehood was achieved, he was elected to the West Virginia State Senate. Stevenson served in the state senate from 1863 until 1868, and during the last three years became its president. That year he was elected on the Republican ticket as Governor of West Virginia. He served as governor for two years, but lost his bid for reelection in 1870. After the bulk of his political career, he became a partner in the Parkersburg State Journal and a director of the West Virginia Oil Land Company. Stevenson had two more major political tasks, he served as a Presidential Elector in 1872 as he had in 1864. Death and legacy Stevenson died at his home on Juliana Street in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and is buried in the Riverview Cemetery there.

A two-episode OVA was also released for the series. The series was licensed for North America by Geneon Entertainment, but after the closure of Geneon, its DVD releases went out of print. In 2009, Sentai Filmworks had acquired the license. A related manga series written and illustrated by Botan Hanayashiki under the name \\"BH Snow+Clinic\\" was also released. Originally serialized in the sh≈çnen manga magazine Dragon Junior, the individual chapters were published in three tank≈çbon volumes by Kadokawa Shoten. Plot The story is based around 11-year-old Saga Bergman, a young girl in a small German town called Muhlenberg (based on real town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber). Saga lives with her grandmother Regina and works in a coffee shop when not in school. Saga is extremely structured and plans her life down to the minute. One day, she notices a tiny creature in a fluffy outfit that appears to be starving. She offers it a waffle, which helps revive the tiny creature. Saga learns that this tiny creature is Sugar, an apprentice season fairy. Sugar explains that season fairies alter the weather by playing a magical musical instrument, and her specialty is snow, which she creates by playing the piccolo. Sugar is joined by two more apprentice season fairies, Salt, an outgoing male fairy who plays the trumpet to make the sun shine more brightly, and Pepper, a quiet and caring female fairy who plays the harp to make the wind blow. All three apprentices are shocked at the realization that Saga can see them, since humans are not supposed to be able to see season fairies. Pepper speculates that exceptional humans might be able to see them, which is the best possible explanation. Sugar tells Saga that the three have been sent to Earth to train as full-fledged season fairies, and to do that, they must find 'Twinkles'. Sugar moves into Saga's bedroom and sets up residence, much to the consternation of the super-structured Saga. Saga is a well-meaning, intelligent and highly organized girl who feels compelled to look after the childish, loud and irresponsible Sugar, who is incapable of looking after herself. The story is complicated further with the arrival of three adult season fairies‚ÄîTurmeric, a cloud fairy; Ginger, a rain fairy; and the Elder, the leader of the season fairies‚Äîand two more apprentices‚ÄîCinnamon, a hail fairy, and Basil, a thunder fairy. With the highly disruptive presence of Sugar, Saga's life goes haywire. Her friends Norma and Anne think that she is losing her mind, and her teacher, Miss Hanna, is worried that her best student is acting strangely. Not at all concerned with her strange behavior is Greta, an egotistical rich girl who considers Saga to be her rival, and Phil, a goofy inventor who keeps trying to persuade Saga to help him with his experiments, if he is not already busy building and trying out his latest device. Characters ; : ; Rona Aguilar (Tagalog) :: Sugar is a female snow fairy apprentice working to learn how to be a full-fledged fairy. She comes to the human world for the final part of her training which requires her to find a so-called \\"Twinkle\\".

She loves to kiss anyone she is fond of when happy. After Saga first feeds her a waffle, which she comes to love, though she mispronounces their name as \\"waffo\\". In the manga adaptation, she was familiar with the word before eating one. ; : ; Hazel Hernan (Tagalog) :: Age: 11. Saga Bergman is the main protagonist of the series. Her mother died in an accident, so she lives with her grandmother. Saga is somewhat obsessed with planning, scheduling her day nearly to the minute and is frustrated when her plans go off schedule. She can be quick to lose her temper when she deals with Sugar, however, she is actually very kind and quite mature for her age. Saga works in a coffee shop and regularly stops at the local music store to play her mother's piano. ; : ; Rowena Benavidez‚ÄìLazaro (Tagalog) :: Salt is a male apprentice sun fairy and another of Sugar's friends who come to the human world with her to find a \\"Twinkle\\".

The spoiled daughter of a rich family, she can be arrogant and boastful, though at times shows that she does have a good heart. She often sets up impromptu contests between herself and Saga. ; : ; Rowena Raganit (Tagalog) :: Norma is the other of Saga's best friends. She is flighty and somewhat forgetful, comically late when meeting up with Saga and Anne.

She has romantic but unrequited feelings for Turmeric. ; : ; Louie Paraboles (Tagalog) :: Turmeric is an adult cloud fairy who plays the cello. Turmeric is a kind, thoughtful, and subdued fairy who constantly strives to perfect his clouds, and is therefore oblivious to Ginger's romantic attention towards him. ; : ; Montreal Repuyan (Tagalog) :: The Elder is the leader of the season fairies and capable of creating any kind of weather. Though extremely wise, he often appears foolish, particularly in his dedicated pursuit of Ginger. ; : :: The star actor of the Hammond Theater Group and a talented piano player who idolizes Saga's late mother. Although sometimes careless with his off-hand remarks, he is really a gentle and kind young man.

It can be assumed that she was married, but her husband's whereabouts remain unknown after she died. Production The initial concept for A Little Snow Fairy Sugar began with the producers at TBS deciding that they wanted to have a series about a little fairy. Haruka Aoi took this idea and came up with the concept of a fantasy town where Season Faries lived and traveled the world to control the weather. Together Aoi, Yasunori Yamada who was responsible for the series structure, a representative from Kadokawa Shoten, and series director Shinichiro Kimura the final framework for the series was hammered out. Kimura focused on telling a story that focuses on the relationship between Sugar and Saga, while not fully explaining some things to viewers. In particular, he notes that the series never really explains what the \\"Twinkles\\" are that they faeries are searching for because he felt viewers should draw their own conclusions and that the show's purpose to show how friendships are formed and how they result in people growing as human beings. The character of Sugar started as with the basic idea that the main character of the series would be a snow fairy. When trying to think of a name, Yamada associated snow with white, which he said reminded him of \\"sugar\\", giving the snow fairy its name. With that name decided, he decided that all of the other fairies would also have the names of condiments. Initially, the story was going to be set in the fairy world, with no humans at all, however, as they worked on fleshing out the story, the character of Saga was introduced. Aoi originally envisioned her as a quiet and calm girl, but she was eventually changed into the more assertive and organization obsessed character seen in the final version. Yamada notes that Kimura was responsible for turning the story into a more positive and cheerful one than the original concept might have resulted in. Yamada felt the character of Greta was a key character, particularly towards the series. He notes that he and other staff members adored her as they felt she was a \\"good girl and a lovable character\\". Aoi was initially surprised to find that Sugar ended up being more tomboyish than he had originally planned, but after watching the completed series, he decided that it made her cute. He felt the completed series was a \\"great mixture of scenario, characters, music, background and voice acting.\\" The visual designs for the characters began with conceptual designs by Koge-Donbo. As the series was an original work and not based on a manga, she was unsure on what the final appearances for the characters would be like. Character designer Keiko Kawashima notes that this made it confusing for him to follow the designs at first. He initially designed Saga with a more youthful appearance, but in discussing the character with Kimura, it was decided that she should have a more mature appearance that would be clearly distinctive from the appearances of the fairies. In animating the series, full-digital animation is used. Because of the fairies smaller size and movements, they would initially be drawn the same size as humans, then shrunk down when needed for scenes with humans. This allowed the animators to give the characters more detailed and realistic movements. In designing the setting for the series, art director Shichiro Kobayashi was sent to Germany to search for locations. Though initially reluctant to go, as he felt reference materials would be enough, Kobayashi notes that it ended up being a valuable experience as he was able to better capture the Europeans' aesthetic sense and the \\"tastefulness\\" that permeates the towns and houses. Returning to Japan, he attempted to capture the \\"atmosphere\\" of the region, using pastel colors and aiming to make the art feel \\"comfortable.\\" The series music began with Pioneer requesting that it be romantic feeling, using piano and strings, which pleased music director Nobuyoshi Mitsumune, who had been working with the medium in his previous project. Wanting to also do something different, Mitsumune initially considered using elements from the rock and dance genres, but after seeing the conceptual art and reading the series scripts, he revisited his vision and decided to go with something more orthodox that better matched the inspiration he felt from the series. For the vocal tracks, sound director Yota Tsuruoka notes that the most difficult issue was dealing with the scenes where the faeries and humans would be having separate, unrelated conversations at the same time. He decided not to just have the tracks recorded separately for combining in the editing stage, but instead had the voice actors actually perform the scenes as written, with each group doing their conversations at the same time just as it occurs on screen.

Born in 1978, Murphy Himself was first ridden by Ginny Leng. She bought him in Northern Ireland as a supposed four-year-old (although he later turned out to be three), and began eventing him. Under Ginny, Murphy won both Le Touquet and Burghley. However Ginny, being lightweight and small, had a hard time controlling the gelding, who was an incredible puller on cross- country. She had a few bad falls while competing, and her mother and trainer began to worry that she would be seriously hurt. Ian Stark tried Murphy out in 1988, and he agreed to exchange horses with Leng, Murphy for his horse Griffin. The duo had a terrific success together, completing Badminton several times, receiving the silver medal at the 1990 FEI World Equestrian Games in Stockholm representing the British Team, and competing in the Barcelona Olympics. Murphy was an amazing athlete, possessing speed, stamina, and a fantastic jumping ability. After a disappointing run at Barcelona, where the ground jury did not pass Murphy in the final horse inspection, the gelding was retired. He was fox hunted a few times, before he had to be put down due to a shattered hock from an injury in the pasture.

It is identical in composition with the artificial product chrome yellow used as a paint pigment.  Description  Crocoite is commonly found as large, well-developed prismatic adamantine crystals, although in many cases are poorly terminated. Crystals are of a bright hyacinth-red color, translucent, and have an adamantine to vitreous lustre. On exposure to UV light some of the translucency and brilliancy is lost. The streak is orange-yellow; Mohs hardness is 2.5‚Äì3; and the specific gravity is 6.0. Crocoite crystal structure It was discovered at the Berezovskoe Au Deposit (Berezovsk Mines) near Ekaterinburg in the Urals in 1766; and named crocoise by F. S. Beudant in 1832, from the Greek Œ∫œÅœåŒ∫ŒøœÇ (krokos), saffron, in allusion to its color, a name first altered to crocoisite and afterwards to crocoite. In the type locality the crystals are found in gold-bearing quartz-veins traversing granite or gneiss and associated with crocoite are quartz, embreyite, phoenicochroite and vauquelinite. Phoenicochroite is a basic lead chromate, Pb2CrO5 with dark red crystals, and vauquelinite a lead and copper phosphate-chromate, Pb2CuCrO4PO4OH, with brown or green monoclinic crystals. Vauquelinite was named after Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who in 1797 discovered (simultaneously with and independently of M. H. Klaproth) the element chromium in crocoite. Abundant masses with exceptional examples of crocoite crystals have been found in the Extended Mine at Mount Dundas as well as the Adelaide, Red Lead, West Comet, Platt and a few other Mines at Dundas, Tasmania; they are usually found in long slender prisms, usually about 10‚Äì20 mm but rarely up to 100 mm (4 inches) in length, with a brilliant lustre and color. Crocoite is also the official Tasmanian mineral emblem. Other localities which have yielded good crystallized specimens are Congonhas do Campo near Ouro Preto in Brazil, Luzon in the Philippines, Mutare in Mashonaland, near Menzies in Western Australia, plus Brazil, Germany and South Africa. The relative rarity of crocoite is connected with the specific conditions required for its formation: an oxidation zone of lead ore bed and presence of ultramafic rocks serving as the source of chromium (in chromite). Oxidation of Cr3+ into CrO42‚àí (from chromite) and decomposition of galena (or other primary lead minerals) are required for crocoite formation. These conditions are relatively unusual. As crocoite is composed of lead(II) chromate, it is toxic, containing both lead and hexavalent chromium. Crocoite from Tasmania has been mined from the Dundas Extended Mine by Mike and Eleanor Phelan since the mid-1980s, but the mine's origins date back to 1892 when it was used as a prospecting tunnel for silver lead. As at April 2019, the mine is for sale (A$300,000) with the owners then continuing to operate the nearby Stichtite mine.For $300,000, you could own a hobby mine in a Tasmanian ghost town, Damian McIntyre, ABC News Online, 2019-04-26  Gallery  Examples of crocoite Crocoite from Tasmania.jpgSpecimen from the Red Lead Mine, Tasmania, Australia Crocoite-360746.jpgCrocoite from Adelaide Mine, Dundas mineral field, Zeehan District, Tasmania, Australia crocoite09.jpgCrystal intergrowth Berezov-crocoite.jpgOn pyromorphite ‚Äì Berezovsk ‚Äì Deposit Topotype  See also  * Bellite  References  * * Bushmakin, A.F., 1996.

The Red Victorian is a community space constructed in 1904 in San Francisco's Haight Ashbury District. The building has seen many names and eras - it was originally named the Jefferson Hotel. In 1967, it became the Jeffrey Haight during the Summer of Love. In 1977, Sami Sunchild, environmental artist and social activist, acquired the building, painted the Victorian facade red and named it the \\"Red Victorian\\". She intended the business to embody the ideas of the area, including the peace movement, the environmental movement, the cooperative community movement, and the social justice movement. Until her death in 2013, Sunchild hosted World Peace Conversations every Sunday morning. Of the conversations, she said, \\"As part of a movement to restore the lost art of conversation, Peaceful World Conversations bring people together to talk about topics that matter in their own lives and in the world as a whole.\\".Peaceful World Conversations Sunchild's hotel was also known for the themed, unique guest room designs such as the \\"Summer of Love\\" room, the \\"Flower Children\\" room, and the \\"Peacock\\" room with eclectic, themed decor. In 2014, Jessy Kate Schingler established the Red Victorian, LLC and took over management of the Red Victorian from Sunchild's non-profit and beneficiary of the hotel. The mission of the new Red Victorian is to experiment with co- living and new methods of urban community development and residential models. The Red Victorian is part of the Embassy Network, an organization that provides resources and networking to a variety of shared living spaces. The Red Victorian, LLC announced the early termination of its lease in September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the building is occupied by Fishbowl SF , a trans and gender nonconforming performance art and housing justice activist group attempting to turn it into affordable housing for QTBIPOC ( queer, trans, Black, Indigenous, people of color ). They are former workers and independent contractors for the Red Vic LLC who have refused to leave the building past its closure date. It is unclear when and if the current occupation and operations will end.

It was first specified by the European Broadcasting Union in 1997, and updated in 2001 and 2003. It has been accepted as the ITU recommendation ITU-R BS.1352-3, Annex 1. The purpose of this file format is the addition of metadata to facilitate the seamless exchange of sound data between different computer platforms and applications. It specifies the format of metadata, allowing audio processing elements to identify themselves, document their activities, and supports timecode to enable synchronization with other recordings. This metadata is stored as extension chunks in a standard digital audio WAV file. Files conforming to the Broadcast Wave specification have names ending with the filename extension .WAV.  Details  In addition to the common WAVE chunks, the following extension chunks can appear in a Broadcast Wave file:EBU BWF User Guide * Original Bext chunk (Broadcast Extension - 'bext') * iXML chunk ('iXML') * Quality chunk ('qlty') * MPEG audio extension chunk ('mext') * Peak Envelope chunk ('levl') * link chunk ('link') * axml chunk ('axml') Since the only difference between a BWF and a \\"normal\\" WAV is the extended information in the file header (Bext-Chunk, Coding-History, etc...), a BWF does not require a special player for playback. Unfortunately, this compatibility also preserves the filesize limitation that WAV files have (4 GB of audio data per data chunk). In order to be able to store audio which would exceed this limit, 2 different chunks exist allowing the audio material to be spread across several files: cont & link (see list above) Since there is no official naming convention for these subsequent files, and it is still desirable to see at a glance which ones belong to a continuous piece of audio, a lot of programs apply a numbering scheme to the file suffix: .wav, .w01, .w02, ..., .wNN. Each of those segments is a regular Wave/BWF file, but players that are aware of the continue/link chunk will treat all segments as one single, long piece of audio when opening the first segment \\".wav\\". As an extension, RF64 is a BWF-compatible multichannel file format enabling file sizes to exceed 4 GB that has been specified in 2006. The axml (additional XML) chunk allows users to incorporate data compliant with the XML format with the audio; the chunk may contain data fragments from one or more schema. On August 2012, the European Broadcasting Union published a specification for embedding International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) in the axml chunk of the Broadcast Wave Format. BWF is specified for use in MXF by SMPTE standard 382. BWF is specified for use in AES31.

It mentions his works The Case of Ireland and Dioptrica nova, his friendship with John Locke, and his son Samuel. William Molyneux FRS (; 17 April 1656 ‚Äì 11 October 1698) was an Anglo-Irish writer on science, politics and natural philosophy. He is noted as a close friend of fellow philosopher John Locke, and for proposing Molyneux's Problem, a thought experiment widely discussed. Life He was born in Dublin to Samuel Molyneux (1616‚Äì1693), lawyer and landowner (whose grandfather, Sir Thomas Molyneux, had come to Dublin from Calais in the 1560s), and his wife, Anne, n√©e Dowdall.Dublin Historical Record, 1960 The second of five children, William Molyneux came from a relatively prosperous Anglican background, with his father established at Castle Dillon in County Armagh, and his uncle Colonel Adam Molyneux holding large estates inherited from the Dowdall's in Ballymulvey, near Ballymahon in County Longford. He was close to his brother Sir Thomas Molyneux, with whom he later shared philosophical interests. His sister Jane married Anthony Dopping, the eventual Anglican Bishop of Meath. In 1671 Molyneux started at Trinity College, Dublin where he became an avid reader of the leading figures of the Scientific Revolution. After attaining a Bachelor of Arts there, Molyneux was sent to study law in the Middle Temple, London from 1675 to 1678. In 1678 he married Lucy Domville (?‚Äì1691), the youngest daughter of Sir Wiliam Domville , the Attorney-General for Ireland, and his wife Bridget Lake. His wife became ill, which led to blindness after their marriage, and died young. Of their 3 children, only Samuel Molyneux (1689‚Äì1728) lived past childhood. Samuel went on to become an astronomer and politician who worked with his father on various scientific endeavours.Science and Its Times via  Career and publications  Because of his inheritance, Molyneux was financially independent.James G. O'Hara, 'Molyneux, William (1656‚Äì1698)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 4 November 2008 Nonetheless, he held a number of official positions throughout his life. He was appointed Joint Surveyor General of the King's buildings and works in Ireland in 1684. In 1687 he invented a new type of sundial called a Sciothericum telescopicum that used special double gnomon and a telescope to measure the time of noon to within 15 seconds. He represented Dublin University in Parliament from 1692 until his death. He had also served as a commissioner of forfeited estates in 1693, resigning a few months later due to ill health. Meanwhile, Molyneux was responsible for a number of publications reflecting his diverse interests. His first book was editing and translating into English the work of Ren√© Descartes which was published in London, 1680 as Six Metaphysical Meditations, Wherein it is Proved that there is a God.... In 1682 Molyneux collaborated with Roderic O'Flaherty to collect material for Moses Pitt's Atlas. In 1685, Pitt's financial crisis lead to cancellation of the project but much valuable early Irish history had been collected. Molyneux struck a friendship with O'Flaherty and assisted when the latter's treatise Ogygia was published in London. Meanwhile, in October 1683 he founded the Dublin Philosophical Society along the lines of the Royal Society (of which Molyneux became a fellow in 1685), and became its first Secretary. He was active in the proceedings of the society‚Äîrecording weather data, calculating eclipses and demonstrating instruments and experiments.James G. O'Hara, 'Molyneux, William (1656‚Äì1698)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 Molyneux also published several papers in Philosophical Transactions, as well as papers on optics, natural philosophy, and miscellaneous topics. Perhaps his best known scientific work was Dioptrica Nova, A treatise of dioptricks in two parts, wherein the various effects and appearances of spherick glasses, both convex and concave, single and combined, in telescopes and microscopes, together with their usefulness in many concerns of humane life, are explained, published in London 1692. After John Locke published his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Molyneux wrote to him praising the work. Early in 1698, Molyneux published The Case of Ireland's being Bound by Acts of Parliament in England, Stated. This controversial work‚Äîthrough application of historical and legal precedent‚Äîdealt with contentious constitutional issues that had emerged in the latter years of the seventeenth century as a result of attempts on the part of the English Parliament to pass laws that would suppress the Irish woolen trade. It also dealt with the disputed appellate jurisdiction of the Irish House of Lords. Molyneux's arguments reflected those made in an unpublished piece written by his father-in-law Sir William Domville, entitled A Disquisition Touching That Great Question Whether an Act of Parliament Made in England Shall Bind the Kingdom and People of Ireland Without Their Allowance and Acceptance of Such Act in the Kingdom of Ireland.Patrick Kelly. 'Sir William Domville, A Disquisition Touching That Great Question...', Analecta Hibernica, no. 40 (2007): 19‚Äì69. Following a debate in the English House of Commons, it was resolved that Molyneux's publication was 'of dangerous consequence to the crown and people of England by denying the authority of the king and parliament of England to bind the kingdom and people of Ireland'.James G. O'Hara, 'Molyneux, William (1656‚Äì1698)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 29 Feb 2008 Despite condemnation in England, Molyneux was not punished but his work was condemned as seditious and was ceremonially burned at Tyburn by the public hangman. His arguments remained topical in Ireland as constitutional issues arose throughout the eighteenth century, and formed part of Swift's argument in Drapier's Letters.Ferguson, Oliver W. Jonathan Swift and Ireland p. 119 The tract also gained attention in the American colonies as they moved towards independence. Although The Case of Ireland, Stated was later associated with independence movements‚Äîboth in Ireland and America‚Äîas one historian points out, 'Molyneux's constitutional arguments can easily be misinterpreted' and he was 'in no sense a separatist'.David Dickson, New Foundations: Ireland 1660‚Äì1800 (Dublin, 2000), 50.  Legacy  Molyneux also proposed the philosophical question that has since become known as Molyneux's Problem, which Locke discussed in later editions of the Essay. The problem of the blind man who gains sight, which he proposed to Locke, is a topic that has been discussed extensively since its publication and into the 21st Century. The University Philosophical Society of Trinity College, Dublin views itself as the successor of the Dublin Philosophical Society, and thus recognises Molyneux as its founder and first president. Molyneux died in Dublin on 11 October 1698 and was buried in St. Audoen's Church, within the burial vault of his great-grandfather, Sir William Ussher.

Mahmoud Asgari (), aged 16, and Ayaz Marhoni (), aged 18, were Iranian teenagers from the province of Khorasan who were publicly hanged in Edalat (Justice) Square in Mashhad, northeast Iran, on July 19, 2005. They were executed after being convicted by the court of having raped a 13-year-old boy. The case attracted international media attention and the facts of the case are heavily debated. Background Shari'a (Islamic Law) in Shiite Iran prescribes the death penalty for homosexual acts but it requires four eye witnesses to the event, but the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which Iran is a signatory, forbids the execution of juveniles. According to Asgari's lawyer, Rohollah Razaz Zadeh, \\"death sentences handed to children by Iranian courts are supposed to be commuted to five years in jail\\", but the Supreme Court in Tehran upheld the death sentence. The ages of the boys remain unclear, with some sources claiming they were fourteen and sixteen at the time of their arrests and sixteen and eighteen when executed, and others claiming that the older boy, Marhoni, was already nineteen, and therefore not a minor, when the alleged crime(s) took place. On July 19, 2005, the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) posted an article in Persian describing the execution of the two youths. Its headline stated that they had been executed for \\"lavat beh onf\\", which means \\"sodomy/homosexual sex by force\\" and is a legal term used for rape of men by men. Earlier on the morning of the executions, Quds, the local daily newspaper in Mashhad, published a report on the executions. It gave a detailed account of how the two had raped a 13-year-old boy, and included statements by the father of the rape victim. The ISNA article became the center of the dispute. The gay-rights group, OutRage!, led by Peter Tatchell, published its own free translation of the article on July 21.Cited in Ireland, D. (2005) \\"Iran Executes 2 Gay Teenagers\\", retrieved August 1, 2005. Two news sources heavily involved in Iranian exile politics had meanwhile contributed to the spread of the story in English. On July 20, 2005, an Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance, the political wing of the People's Mojahedin (also known as the Mojahedin Khalq Organization or MKO), released a press release about the executions. It stated that: \\"The victims were charged with disrupting public order among other things.\\" It did not mention the charges of rape. Iran Focus, a news website that is widely regarded as an affiliate of the People's Mojahedin, also published an article about the hangings, mentioning no charges at all. International concern On July 22, 2005, Amnesty International issued a news release saying: > \\"According to reports, they were convicted of sexual assault on a 13-year- > old boy and had been detained 14 months ago. Prior to their execution, the > two were also given 228 lashes each for drinking, disturbing the peace and > theft.\\" On July 27, 2005, after researching reports on the hangings, Human Rights Watch released letters to Iran's president and the head of the judiciary. In writing to the Iranian leadership, Human Rights Watch condemned the use of the death penalty in Iran. It stated that the two \\"were put to death on July 19 after they were found guilty of sexually assaulting a thirteen-year-old boy some fourteen months earlier,\\" but did not address whether those charges were accurate. Its public statement noted: > \\"Death is an inhumane punishment, particularly for someone under eighteen at > the time of his crimes,\\" said Hadi Ghaemi, Iran researcher for Human Rights > Watch. \\"All but a handful of countries forbid such executions. Iran should > as well.\\" In Tehran, Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi decried the imposition of the death penalty on minors but did not comment on the nature of the charges in this case.The group OutRage!, and some U.S. and British gay media , reported inaccurately that Ebadi had endorsed claims that the two were executed for consensual sex. In fact, even Iran Focus made it clear that Ebadi made no such claim and that her condemnation was based on longstanding opposition to the death penalty for crimes committed by minors: www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2955 . The first reports in the Iranian media had all identified the hangings as the result of a rape conviction. However, these reports only came to light after later English- language accounts had suggested the two might have been killed for being gay. This made it appear plausible to some that the rape charges might have been simply a \\"cover story\\" put out later by the Iranian government‚Äîeven though the story of rape had actually been the first one told. Several bloggers promoted the story heavily and gave wide coverage to the pictures of the hanging. U.S. blogger Doug Ireland referred to the charges of rape as \\"the Iranian government's story.\\" The hangings quickly became a political issue in disputes over U.S. and European policy toward Iran. The conservative U.S. commentator Andrew Sullivan posted the photographs in an entry on his blog called \\"Islamists versus Gays.\\" Seeing the hangings as a reason gay people should support U.S. military action, he quoted a gay U.S. soldier who wrote him that: > \\"Your post on the Islamo-fascist hanging/murder of the two gay men confirmed > for me that my recent decision to join the U.S. military was correct. I have > to stuff myself back in the closet ‚Äì something I thought I left a decade ago > ‚Äì but our war on terror trumps my personal comfort at this point. Whenever > my friends and family criticize ‚Äì I'll show 'em that link.\\" The Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative U.S. gay group, issued a statement reading, \\"In the wake of news stories and photographs documenting the hanging of two gay Iranian teenagers, Log Cabin Republicans re-affirm their commitment to the global war on terror.\\"  Reason for prosecution  The British group OutRage! alleged that the boys had been executed for engaging in consensual homosexual sex. However, some human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, have urged observers to refrain from casting the incident as a \\"gay\\" issue, and cast doubt on the claim that Marhoni and Asgari were hanged as a result of consensual acts. They have emphasized instead that the executions are a violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Iran is a signatory to both), which prohibit the execution of minors.Kim, Richard. (2005.) \\"Witness to an Execution\\". The Nation. Retrieved December 31, 2006. OutRage! stated that \\"the allegation of sexual assault may either be a trumped up charge to undermine public sympathy for the youths, a frequent tactic by the Islamist regime in Iran\\" or that \\"it may be that the 13 year old was a willing participant but that Iranian law (like UK law) deems that no person of that age is capable of sexual consent and that therefore any sexual contact is automatically deemed in law to be a sex assault.\\" OutRage! also questioned why the 13-year-old was not identified and also put on trial if he had been sexually assaulted. The two were believed to have been juveniles at the time of the offense, and one is believed to have been a juvenile at the time of his execution. Iran frequently executes people for offenses committed as children, a practice condemned by international human rights treaties.Human Rights Watch (2005.) \\"Iran: End Juvenile Executions\\" . Retrieved December 31, 2006. The facts of the case are still subject to heated debate.

Some of the reports that were first used to discredit the rape charges originated with an Iranian dissident group accused of serious human-rights violations, one that is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and Iran (the National Council of Resistance of Iran).  Controversy  Within weeks of the hangings, both reporters and human rights organizations‚Äîwhile continuing to condemn the brutality of the hangings‚Äîbegan to produce more nuanced accounts. The U.S. periodical The Nation published a lengthy investigation of the story. It criticized the role of Peter Tatchell and OutRage! in spreading the belief the executed youths were gay before it had examined the evidence. The article concluded that, given Tatchell's \\"recent statements, it seems likely that his ideological disposition caused him to look past or dismiss information that cast doubt on the 'gay teenagers' story.\\" Faisal Alam, founder of the lesbian and gay Muslim group Al-Fatiha Foundation, published an opinion piece claiming that: \\"Very few people took the time to research the details of the case or even consult with experts who deal with such news on a daily basis. In fact it was almost a week later that we began to read more accurate accounts of why the teens were executed from international human rights groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission ‚Äì all of whom have contacts in Iran and ways to confirm news of such incidents from independent sources.

Their source is Somalia-born activist Afdhere Jama, who lives in San Francisco in the U.S. According to OutRage!, Jama has told them that he has spoken to three people from Mashhad who maintain that Mahmoud Asgari, Ayaz Marhoni, and five other friends were originally accused of committing consensual homosexual acts on each other.Ireland, D. (September 1, 2005.) \\"Shame of Iran: US Remains Silent on Gay Hangings\\" LA Weekly, retrieved December 1, 2005. Simon Forbes of OutRage! has written a 100-page document detailing what OutRage! allegedly learned from Jama: Scott Long of Human Rights Watch noted in 2006 that Afdhere Jama's sources \\"have refused to speak to anyone else, including human rights investigators,\\" and that allegations of a huge crackdown against gay people in Iran based on their evidence are third-hand at best. Long also criticised Doug Ireland for \\"deeply irresponsible\\" reporting by accepting second-hand claims from Iranian exile groups without confirmation.

Aftermath  In addition to Human Rights Watch, Paula Ettelbrick, executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, has also said \\"It was not a gay case.\\" Ettelbrick has also said she was also disturbed by the charged language used by some gay rights groups to condemn the execution, pointing to Peter Tatchell's statement, \\"This is just the latest barbarity by the Islamo-fascists in Iran.\\" Both Sweden and The Netherlands responded to the stories around the Mashhad executions by announcing that they would immediately halt extraditions of LGBT asylum claimants to Iran. The Dutch government also announced that its Ministry of Foreign Affairs would investigate the treatment of gays and lesbians in the country. Civil rights groups in the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia have also called for similar policies. In March 2006 Dutch Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk proposed an end to a moratorium on deporting gay asylum-seekers to Iran, stating that it was now clear \\"that there is no question of executions or death sentences based solely on the fact that a defendant is gay\\", adding that homosexuality was never the primary charge against people. Under parliamentary pressure, and based on evidence from groups including Human Rights Watch that torture of gays in Iran remained endemic, she was forced to extend the moratorium on deportation for a further six months. In late 2006, also due to lobbying from groups including Human Rights Watch, the Netherlands instituted a new policy of removing the burden of proof from Iranian LGBT refugee claimants. Scott Long of Human Rights Watch has written that \\"lesbian and gay Iranians are not abstractions, sheltered from politics‚Äîor missiles. Their lives should not be reduced to the agendas of well-meaning strangers in the West.\\" He added, criticizing allegations he considered unsupported, that \\"If we want to challenge Iran's government, we need facts. There is enough proof of torture and repression that we can do without claims of 'pogroms.'\\" In 2006, the one-year anniversary of the hangings in Mashhad was designated an International Day of Action Against Homophobic Persecution in Iran by OutRage!, with vigils planned for Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Frankfurt, London, Marseille, Mexico City, Moscow, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Stockholm, Toronto, Vancouver, Vienna, Warsaw, Washington, D.C., and other cities and with hearings planned in the British House of Commons. These demonstrations saw a renewal of controversy over whether the claims made about the case by OutRage! had any basis in fact. The New York Times reported that ISNA, the student news agency, carried photographs of the execution. The Washington Post reported that photographs of the hangings were carried by protestors at rallies and demonstrations at over two dozen events worldwide.  Cultural references  * The album Fundamental by the British musical group Pet Shop Boys is \\"Dedicated to Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni\\". * R. Timothy Brady composed an opera, Edalat Square, based on this act. The opera won the 2008 Opera Vista Festival, and was performed at the 2009 Opera Vista Festival in Houston, TX, and was conducted by Viswa Subbaraman. * Jay Paul Deratany wrote the play Haram Iran about the trial and executions of Ayaz Marhoni and Mahmoud Asgari; it was first performed by the Athenaeum Theatre in Chicago.  Use of the execution photograph  A photograph of the teens' execution has been used for various purposes: Dutch right-wing political figure Geert Wilders used it in his short film Fitna as a warning of what would happen to gays in a dystopian future in which Muslims rule the Netherlands, and it has been misrepresented in social media as Palestinians rather than Iranians hanging homosexuals. Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was shown the photograph during a 2008 interview and was asked if he thought \\"gay men and lesbians should die in Iran?\\" Ahmadinejad answered: \\"No, there is no law for their execution in Iran. Either they were drug traffickers or they had killed someone else. Those who kill someone else or engage in acts of rape could be punished by execution. Otherwise, homosexuals are not even known who they are to be hung. So, we don't have executions of homosexuals.\\" In the United States, black-and-white reproductions of the photographs were brought by protesters to a rally in Dupont Circle, and the images were also used in at least 26 other protests in countries around the world, according to those who organized them. Before they closed, the pictures had also been put on display in the windows of Lambda Rising, a LGBT bookstore in Washington, D.C. Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian known for her human rights work, and the founder of Defenders of Human Rights Center protested against the execution of minors. Philip Kennicott, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism, wrote in The Washington Post that \\"perhaps the saddest thing about these pictures is that no major news organization outside Iran has tracked down what really happened.

Early life Jonathan Browning was born on October 22, 1805, in Sumner County, Tennessee. He began his career as a blacksmith, but by 1824 switched to become a gunsmith after an apprenticeship with Samuel Porter in Nashville. He began producing firearms independently by 1831 and shortly thereafter invented a \\"sliding breech\\" repeating rifle, also called a Harmonica gun, between 1834 and 1842 while living in Quincy, Illinois. Each Harmonica gun took two weeks to manufacture by hand and was available to purchase for $24.00. Browning moved his family to White's Creek, near Nashville, about 1827, and resided there until the spring of 1833. Jonathan moved with his extended family and spent a season in Fairfield, Illinois, visiting with his sister Clarissa Neel. About 1834, Jonathan and his brother James Green Browning bought farms thirty miles northeast of Quincy in La Prairie, Illinois. A family story has been passed down that he came to know a young lawyer named Abraham Lincoln, an overnight guest in his home on at least two occasions. Missouri period In October 1838, Governor Lilburn Boggs issued the Extermination Order that caused the followers of Joseph Smith to flee Missouri. Browning came into contact with many of the Latter-day Saint exiles. Curious about the new settlement in Nauvoo, Illinois' swampy lands, Browning paid a visit, meeting with the Latter Day Saints president Joseph Smith, which influenced Browning to convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[1][2] Nauvoo period[edit source] The label on a Browning gun from the Nauvoo period, stating: \\"Holiness to the Lord - Our Preservation.\\" Jonathan Browning Home and Gunsmith Shop, Nauvoo, Illinois. Browning lived and worked in these buildings from 1842-1846. Browning moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, and joined the community in 1842, buying the Bird home and adding a connecting gunshop. In 1844, the Prophet Joseph Smith was assassinated, and Browning was among the group which later fled Nauvoo in 1846. Guns that Browning produced as a Mormon gunsmith were labeled \\"Holiness to the Lord - Our Preservation\\". The Jonathan Browning Home and Gunshop, built in 1842, was restored during the 1960s. Registered with The Mormon Historic Sites Foundation, the museum is open to the public at no charge.[3] Utah period Browning fled Illinois with Brigham Young in late 1846 to escape religious persecution. He settled in the community of Mosquito Creek near Council Bluffs, Iowa, and repaired guns for the local settlers who were migrating to Utah, while awaiting Brigham Young to invite him to join the main body of settlers in Utah. When the Mormon Battalion was formed during the War with Mexico, Browning wanted to join them, but was told by Young that his skills would not be needed by the soldiers as much as by the pioneers' main body in Kanesville. Browning received word from Brigham Young to join the main party of settlers in 1852. He left Mosquito Creek, Iowa, July 8, 1852, and migrated across the Rocky Mountains as the captain of ten wagons in the Henry W. Miller Company. He arrived on October 2, 1852, with six wagons and $600 to the Salt Lake Valley. Browning moved to Ogden, Utah, where he established a gun shop. As was common in the community, Jonathan Browning was a polygamist, having taken three wives. He fathered 22 children and had two stepdaughters; prominent among them was the gun designer John Moses Browning, who became one of the most important figures in developing modern automatic and semi-automatic firearms; and Matthew Sandefur Browning (1859 ‚Äì 1923), co-founder of Browning Brothers. Jonathan ran his gun shop and invested in real estate in Ogden. He was a member of the Utah Territorial Assembly (1853-1854) and served as Justice of the Peace and Probate Judge for Weber County, Utah Territory. His primary focus, though, was on his gun shop located along present-day Washington Avenue in Ogden. His son John Moses later recalled, \\"We ridiculed some of the guns we fixed, and I damned some of them when Pappy wasn't near, but it never occurred to us to make better ones. He was too old, and I was too young.\\" Jonathan died on June 21, 1879, in Ogden. References *John Browning & Curt Gentry. John M. Browning, American Gunmaker. New York: Doubleday, 1964.

Retinal detachments are usually caused by retinal tears, and a scleral buckle can be used to close the retinal break, both for acute and chronic retinal detachments. Scleral buckles come in many shapes and sizes. A silicone sponge (with air filled cells) is a cylindrical element that comes in various sizes. An encircling band is a thin silicone band sewn around the circumference of the sclera of the eye. A solid silicone grooved tyre element is also used. Buckles are often placed under a band to create a dimple on the eye wall. The scleral buckle is secured around the eyeball under the conjunctiva. This moves the wall of the eye closer to the detached retina. This alteration in the relationships of the tissues seems to allow the fluid which has formed under the retina to be pumped out, and the retina to re-attach. The physics or physiology of this process are not fully understood. Retinal detachment surgery usually also involves the use of cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation. The laser or cryotherapy forms a permanent adhesion around the retinal break and prevents further accumulation of fluid and re-detachment. The usage of scleral buckle is a source of debate only for complex retinal detachment surgery amongst surgeons, and research has been conducted to compare safety and effectiveness outcomes of scleral buckling, pars plana vitrectomy with scleral buckle versus pars plana victrectomy without scleral buckle. Scleral buckles are done using local or general anesthesia and are often done as outpatient procedures. In the majority of treatments the buckle is left in place permanently, although in some instances the buckles can be removed after the retina heals. The buckle may also be removed in the event of infection. A link between scleral buckles and Adie syndrome may exist. Results from two randomized controlled trials of 216 patients comparing retinal detachment outcomes from pneumatic retinopexy versus scleral buckle found some evidence suggesting that scleral buckle was less likely to result in a recurrence of retinal detachment than pneumatic retinopexy.

Field marshal is ranked immediately above general, but not exercised in the regular army structure. It is a largely ceremonial or wartime rank, having been awarded only twice. A field marshal's insignia consists of the national emblem over a crossed baton and sabre in a lotus blossom wreath. Sam Manekshaw was the first field marshal of India, and was conferred the rank on 1 January 1973. The second was Kodandera M. Cariappa, who was conferred the rank on 15 January 1986. Field marshal is equivalent to an admiral of the fleet in the Indian Navy and a Marshal of the Indian Air Force in the Indian Air Force. In the navy, admiral of the fleet has never been awarded, but from the air force, Arjan Singh was promoted to the marshal of the air force. History To date, only two Indian Army officers have been conferred the rank. It was first conferred to Sam Manekshaw in 1973, in recognition of his service and leadership in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War. In 1971, after the war, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi decided to promote Manekshaw to field marshal and subsequently to appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). This appointment was dropped after several objections from the bureaucracy and the commanders of the navy and the air force. On 3 January 1973, after his term as the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. As it was the first appointment, several entitlements of the rank, including the badges and ribbons, were yet to worked out. A few weeks before Manekshaw's appointment, the field marshal's badges of rank were made at the Army workshop in Delhi Cantonment. They were inspired by the British field marshal insignia. The second individual to be conferred the rank was Kodandera M. Cariappa, the first Indian to serve as the commander‚Äìin‚Äìchief of the Indian Army. Unlike Manekshaw, who was conferred the rank just before his retirement, Cariappa was already retired in 1953, and since a field marshal never retires, therefore retired officers cannot be given the rank. But as a token of gratitude for the exemplary service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India overruled the pre-established criteria, and conferred the rank of field marshal on him on 15 January 1986 at a special investiture ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Overview Field marshal is the five-star rank and highest attainable rank in the Indian Army. Though the rank is placed above general, it is not observed in the regular structure. It is a largely ceremonial or wartime rank, having been awarded only twice. General Nirmal Chander Vij holding the Field Marshal's baton A field marshal receives the full pay of a four‚Äìstar general, and is considered a serving officer until their death. They wear a full uniform on all ceremonial occasions. In addition to this, they also run an office in the Army Headquarters with a secretariat. Field marshal is equivalent to an admiral of the fleet in the Indian Navy or a marshal of the Air Force in the Indian Air Force. While Arjan Singh is the only holder of the marshal of the air force to date, no officer has ever been promoted to admiral of the fleet. =Insignia= A field marshal's insignia consists of the national emblem over a crossed baton and sabre in a lotus blossom wreath. On appointment, field marshals are awarded a gold-tipped baton which they may carry on formal occasions. The star insignia, which comprises five golden stars over a red strip, is used on car pennants, rank flags and as gorget patches. Rank holders =Sam Manekshaw= Sam Manekshaw, MC (1914‚Äì2008), also known as \\"Sam Bahadur\\" (\\"Sam the Brave\\"), was the first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal. Commissioned into the British Indian Army on 1 February 1935 with seniority antedated to 4 February 1934, Manekshaw's distinguished military career spanned four decades and five wars, beginning with service in World War II. He was first attached to the 2nd Battalion of Royal Scots, and later posted to the 4th Battalion of 12th Frontier Force Regiment, commonly known as the 54th Sikhs. Following partition, he was reassigned to the 16th Punjab Regiment. Manekshaw rose to be the 8th COAS of the Indian Army in 1969, and under his command Indian forces conducted successful campaigns against Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 that led to the Liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971.The war lasted for 12 days from December 3 to December 16, one among the Shortest wars of the History. On December 16 1971, Lt. Gen A.K Niazi of the Pakistan Army signed the Instrument of Surrender at Dhaka in the presence of Lt. Gen. Jagjit Aurora, Lt. Gen. J.F.R Jacob and other Senior Officers of the Indian Army. More than 94000 Pakistani Soldiers surrendered to the Indian Army, which was recorded as one among the largest surrender in the History. Though, Gen. Yahya Khan of Pakistan was not in favour of the Surrender, but he had to agree in order to save his soldiers. The decisive results achieved by the Indian Army during this war, under the able military leadership of Manekshaw, gave the nation a new sense of confidence, and in recognition of his services, in January 1973 the president of India conferred the rank of field marshal on him. Later, he was also awarded the Padma Vibhushan and the Padma Bhushan, the second and third highest Indian civilian awards respectively, for his services to the Indian nation. Controversies Though Sam Manekshaw was conferred the rank of field marshal in 1973, it was reported that he was never given the complete allowances he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and made sure that the field marshal was presented with a cheque for ‚Çπ1.3 crores‚Äìhis arrears of pay for over 30 years. Even more surprisingly, Manekshaw's funeral was not attended by the top brass from civil, military, or political leadership. =Kodandera Madappa Cariappa= Kodandera Madappa Cariappa, OBE (1899‚Äì1993), was the first Indian to be appointed as commander- in-chief (C-in-C) of the Indian Army. His distinguished military career spanned almost three decades. Cariappa joined the British Indian Army on 1 December 1919, and was commissioned as temporary second lieutenant in the 2/88 Carnatic Infantry. He was later transferred to 2/125 Napier Rifles, then to the 7th Prince of Wales Own Dogra Regiment in June 1922, and finally to the 1/7 Rajput, which became his parent regiment. He was the first Indian officer to attend the course at Staff College, Quetta, the first Indian to command a battalion in the Indian Army, and also was one of the first two Indians selected to undergo a training course at the Imperial Defence College, Camberly, UK. He served in various staff capacities at various unit and command headquarters (HQ) and also at the General HQ, New Delhi. He led the Indian forces in Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. He was a member of the Army Sub Committee of the Forces Reconstitution Committee, which divided the British Indian Army into the Indian and Pakistani Armies after the Partition of India in 1947. After his retirement from the Indian Army in 1953, he served as the high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. As a token of gratitude for the exemplary service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India conferred the rank of field marshal on Cariappa in his 87th year, on 14 January 1986.

Robinson or A. A. Robinson, was an American civil engineer who rose through the ranks of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to eventually become the railroad's vice president and general manager. After resigning from the Santa Fe, Robinson became president of the Mexican Central Railway.  Youth and education  He was born on October 21, 1844, near South Reading, Vermont. His mother moved the family, after his father's death, to Wisconsin, where Robinson worked as a clerk in his stepfather's store until 1861. When his stepfather became ill and closed the family store, Robinson turned to tobacco farming for a few years to support the family. In 1865 he enrolled at the University of Michigan where one of his older brothers, Stillman W. Robinson, was a faculty member. He graduated there in 1869, and two years later he earned a Master of Science degree. In 1900 he was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree.  Railroad career  While studying for his advanced degrees, Robinson worked for the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad in 1869 and 1870. He began his employment with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway on April 1, 1871. Robinson took on many railroad building challenges for the Santa Fe, and under his guidance, the railroad built nearly 5,000 miles of track, including the connection from Topeka, Kansas, to Chicago, Illinois, and the railroad's expansion into Texas and New Mexico before he resigned in 1893. In 1893, when the Santa Fe entered receivership, he was the popular choice among the railroad's employees to become president. But it was Joseph Reinhart, whose connections in the financial industry played a more important role, who became the Santa Fe's president. Robinson resigned from the Santa Fe to take the presidency of the Mexican Central Railway instead. This move may have been the best for Robinson after all as the Santa Fe struggled to regain solvency for the next year and as the press placed the blame for the railroad's collapse squarely on Reinhart. He died in Topeka on November 7, 1918.

Its headquarters were located on the grounds of Washington-Dulles International Airport, and in the Dulles area of Loudoun County, Virginia, United States.\\"Contact Us,\\" MAXjet Airways. February 18, 2007. Retrieved on September 25, 2009. \\"44965 Aviation Drive, Suite 260 Dulles, VA 20166, USA \\" MAXjet operated services to London Stansted Airport, United Kingdom from Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York. From the beginning, MAXjet Airways may have been compromised by a lack of economies of scale, having only a maximum of 5 aircraft at the height of its operations, although this is similar to other competing airlines in this class (EOS, SilverJet Fountain, Sam, Silverjet plans expansion through multi-million pound funding drive , Business Weekly, November 26, 2007 etc.). It offered passengers airport lounge access (flagship lounge at Stansted; shared, non- proprietary at JFK and LAX; not available in Las Vegas), premium complimentary meals and beverages and on-demand in-flight entertainment. On 24 December 2007, the airline filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and ceased operations. The airline confirmed that Eos Airlines was to accommodate passengers on their Stansted to JFK services.Wilen, John, Maxjet in last-ditch talks, Associated Press, December 24, 2007 History livery MAXjet Boeing 767-200 in Basic Colors On 25 April 2005, the airline officially changed its name from SkyLink Airways to MAXjet Airways following a formal objection to the original name from SkyLink Aviation in Canada. On 23 August 2005 it was granted final approval to launch services by the United States Department of Transportation. The airline was publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market as \\"MAXJ\\". It operated its first service from New York to London on 1 November 2005. Founded in 2003, the airline was conceived as a transatlantic low-cost carrier that would code share with domestic low-cost carriers at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. During its start-up phase, management expressed concern over the economics of applying the low cost carrier model to transatlantic routes and instead repositioned the airline as a premium all-business-class service. MAXjet's target market was premium economy and \\"savvy\\" business class passengers. The success of MAXjet‚Äôs all-business-class service continued to grow as the company claimed load factors of 83.1% (June 2007) on its network from London Stansted. As well as the scheduled routes, MAXjet‚Äôs luxury charter operations continued to grow with the acquisition of more aircraft. Some aircraft were planned to focus on the growing charter business as well as being used as support on the New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas scheduled routes. The airline‚Äôs luxury charter business, which experienced significant growth, transported groups to various destinations throughout Europe, the Caribbean and the USA. Charters included Stockholm to Las Vegas, and England to Washington D.C. and Los Angeles including a charter for the 2006 U.S Ryder Cup team. The company had a strong customer base that included corporations, government entities and professional sports teams. While the company's \\"MAXflier\\" frequent flier program had been advertised for more than six months on the MAXjet website as being available to customers, it was not actually yet up and running as of October 2007. When questioned regarding this issue, the company's customer service representatives responded that the program would be introduced soon, but were unable to provide an estimate as to exactly when the program would come online. =Suspension of MAXjet shares and filing for bankruptcy= On 7 December 2007, MAXjet suspended trading of its shares on AIM, pending clarification of their financial position. An article in the Financial Times on 23 December 2007 reported that the company was in \\"last- ditch talks\\" to arrange a financial rescue package. However, the following morning the company announced on its website that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Passengers who had yet to travel were advised to seek a refund from the point of purchase. The company announced it had already begun to make alternative travel or accommodation arrangements for those left stranded. On 24 December 2007, MAXjet announced that they permanently suspended all flight operations citing rising fuel costs, increased crew salaries, and other unforeseen costs. The airline purchased tickets to accommodate passengers on Eos Airlines, and Continental Airlines and Silverjet both made offers to accommodate stranded MAXjet passengers. On March 25, 2008, MAXjet announced that operations will soon start again following an acquisition by NCA Sports Group to restart its operation as a charter service. However that failed in August 2008.

MAXjet aircraft were fitted with traditional leather business-class \\"deep-recline\\" cradle-seats with a 60-inch seat pitch (distance between a seat and the same point on the seat in front of it) and a 160-degree recline. On-demand entertainment, which included 100 hours of movies, television programs and music videos as well as pure music audio content, was available via individual portable media players called \\"MAXplayers\\", which were provided on each flight. Although the seats were new, MAXjet aircraft had a relatively old style cabin fit, so the seats were not equipped with conventional built-in entertainment systems or in-flight A/C power ports. The airline's catering used restaurant china, metal cutlery and stemmed glassware, and offered complimentary premium liquor, beer, champagne and a regularly changing wine selection.

The company manufactures food products in the United States and internationally -- specializing in turkey, cured deli meats, raw roasts and specialty products such as soups and salads, sandwiches, and entr√©es. Butterball LLC was a joint venture of Smithfield Foods and Maxwell Farms Inc., an affiliate of the Goldsboro Milling Co. Seaboard Corporation bought Smithfield's stake in Butterball in 2010. The company sells over one billion pounds of turkey a year. Though the Butterball brand has been formally recognized since 1940, Butterball LLC was formed in 2006. In Canada, the rights to Butterball are owned by Exceldor Foods Ltd. Products According to Butterball, the following products are sold under the Butterball name:Turkey ProductsButterball *whole turkeys *turkey cuts *cold cuts *sausage *turkey bacon *turkey medallions, strips, chicken strips *turkey franks *ground turkey *frozen turkey burgers, mignons, meatballs Among numerous other brands, English-bred Butterball turkeys are sold in the United Kingdom during Christmas time for the Christmas feast. History Longmont, Colorado The name Butterball was originally registered as trademark #378,438 on June 11, 1940, by Ada Walker of Wyoming, Ohio. Leo Peters purchased the trademark in February 1951. Leo Peters licensed the name to Swift and Co. for 10 years before selling it in the 1960s. Peters sold the name \\"Butterball\\" to Swift, which was acquired by ConAgra in 1990. Leo Peters retained rights to use the name Butterball Farms for his butter products and the company operates today as Butterball Farms, Inc., producing and marketing shaped butter products.Butterball Farms product page In October 2006, ConAgra's Butterball branded turkey business was sold to North Carolina-based Carolina Turkeys, making Carolina Turkey the largest turkey producer in the United States. The company, located southeast of Raleigh, NC in Mount Olive, North Carolina on the Wayne and Duplin county line, subsequently renamed itself Butterball LLC.USA Today: Sale of Butterball turkey business not expected to change Thanksgiving icon In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to a new $12 million building in Greenfield North off Interstate 40 in Garner, North Carolina. The headquarters has a \\"customer experience center\\" with a special kitchen for promotional demonstrations. Smithfield offered $200 million to Maxwell Farms for the portion of Butterball that Smithfield did not own. Chief executive C. Larry Pope said at that time that he hoped Maxwell Farms would spend more on the company's facilities and marketing. A decision had to be made whether to buy Maxwell's share or sell Smithfield's. On September 10, 2010, Smithfield announced the sale of its 49 percent share of Butterball for an estimated $175 million. Maxwell Farms will sell 50 percent of Butterball to Seaboard Corp. Corporate Walter ‚ÄúGator‚Äù Pelletier, past chairman of the National Turkey Federation, is Butterball LLC's corporate secretary -- managing all operating activities from turkey production and directing Maxwell Farms, the managing partner of Butterball. Pelletier is also president of Maxwell Farms, Inc., vice president of Goldsboro Milling Company, and secretary-treasurer of Maxwell Foods, Inc. Pelletier had joined Goldsboro Milling Company in 1981. Turkey Talk-Line Beginning in late 1981, Butterball has maintained a toll-free telephone line called the Turkey Talk- Line to help customers with cooking and preparation questions. Eleven thousand people called in 1981, and in recent years the number has grown to over 200,000 each holiday season. The most frequent question asked is how long a turkey takes to defrost. In The West Wing episode \\"The Indians in the Lobby\\", President Josiah Bartlet calls the number (referred to as the \\"Butterball Hotline\\" in the script) to discuss stuffing and cooking his Thanksgiving turkey while trying to avoid revealing his identity to the operator (voiced by an uncredited Ana Gasteyer). Criticism Animal rights activists such as Mercy for Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, and PETA have accused Butterball of animal cruelty. These organizations cite intentional cruelty inflicted on the birds, as well as the incidental cruelty inherent in the slaughter methods used, and the breeding practices which produce animals too large to reproduce without human intervention. In October 2012, a Mercy for Animals investigator documented a pattern of abuse and neglect at numerous Butterball turkey operations in North Carolina. The investigation revealed workers kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, and throwing turkeys onto the ground or on top of other birds; birds suffering from serious untreated illnesses and injuries, including open sores, infections, and broken bones; and workers grabbing birds by their wings or necks and violently slamming them into tiny transport crates with no regard for their welfare. This investigation occurred less than one year after a Mercy for Animals undercover investigation into a different Butterball turkey facility led to five workers being charged with criminal cruelty to animals. Mercy for Animals‚Äô 2011 investigation at a Butterball turkey factory farm in Shannon, Hoke County, North Carolina revealed Butterball workers violently kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, slamming them into transport crates, and leaving turkeys to suffer from serious untreated injuries and infections. As a result of the investigation, North Carolina officials raided the facility and arrested several employees. In August 2012, Butterball worker Brian Douglas pleaded guilty to felony cruelty to animals‚Äîmarking the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory-farmed birds in United States history. Several days later, another Butterball employee, Rueben Mendoza, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and felony identity theft. In February 2013, two more Butterball workers, Terry Johnson and Billy McBride, were found guilty of misdemeanor animal cruelty as a result of MFA's investigation. In addition to the felony and misdemeanor cruelty convictions, MFA's investigation at Butterball uncovered government corruption. Dr. Sarah Jean Mason, the director of Animal Health Programs with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, was arrested and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges after admitting to warning Butterball about the raid by law enforcement and potentially compromising the criminal cruelty investigation.

Biography He enjoyed a distinguished career as an instructor and department head at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. He was a founding member of the Ten American Painters, American Academy of Arts and Letters and The Guild of Boston Artists. Biography =Early years= Frank Weston Benson was born to George Wiggin Benson, a successful cotton broker, and Elisabeth Poole,Bedford (2000) from families who founded Salem, Massachusetts. Benson obtained his appreciation of the sea from his grandfather, Captain Samuel Benson. When he was 12, he was given a sailboat in which he explored the waterways and marshes and raced against his brother, John Prentiss Benson. To encourage educational activity, Benson's parents gave their children a weekly allowance to foster independent study and hobbies, such as Salem's Hamilton Hall dance classes, Lyceum lectures or equipment for photography. The brothers kept active by participating in sports, as well as fishing and hunting. Benson's father gave him a shotgun and taught him how to hunt shore birds along the North Shore and wildfowl in the local fields and marshes. He spent nearly all of his weekends hunting or fishing in the fields, marshes and streams. To his good friend Dan Henderson, he wrote of their childhood adventures: > \\"We used to spend our Saturdays chasing coot and old squaws in Salem Harbor. > Then, after working hard all day to get one bird, in we would assemble at > Sam Shrum‚Äôs or mine and chew the rag until we were so sleepy we could not > hold up our heads.

One word would > have served for all in my case if it had been invented then, I was generally > 'rattled,' I think, when you and I went ducking.\\" His brother, John Prentiss Benson, was an architect and painter in his own right. Both sons may have been influenced by their mother, Elisabeth Poole Benson, who Frank once remarked, had \\"a little room\\" on the top floor of their house where she would go to paint and \\"forget about the rest of the world\\".About John Benson. =Artistic studies= An avid birdwatcher and wildfowl hunter, Benson wanted to be an ornithological illustrator. At the age of 16, he painted Rail,Peabody Essex Museum, Interactive Presentation, Benson Timeline. one of his first oil paintings, after a hunting trip. He began his studies at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1880, and there befriended Joseph Lindon Smith, Robert Reid and Edmund Charles Tarbell.Dearinger, p. 40. Capitalizing on what he learned, Benson held drawing classes in Salem and painted landscapes during the summer of 1882. On Benson's 21st birthday his parents gave him a gift of $2,000 to study in Europe.Bedford, Frank Weston Benson Biography, p. 1. He traveled to Paris and studied at the Acad√©mie Julien from 1883 to 1884 with Edmund Tarbell and Joseph Lindon Smith; Joseph Lindon Smith and Benson shared an apartment. At the Academy, Benson studied under Jules-Joseph Lefebvre, William Turner Dannat, and Gustave Boulanger. Gustave Boulanger, one of Benson's teachers at Acad√©mie Julien, said to him: \\"Young man, your career is in your hands... you will do very well.\\" After his study at Acad√©mie Julien, Benson traveled to England's Royal Academy to see his painting \\"After the Storm\\" on exhibit. He also spent time in Italy, Belgium, Germany, and Brittany.

Benson - Portrait of Joseph Lindon Smith (1884).jpgPortrait of Joseph Lindon Smith, 1884, Private collection Influences Benson was \\"deeply influenced\\" by Johannes Vermeer and Diego Vel√°zquez, masters from the seventeenth-century. Vermeer painted few works during his lifetime, about 35-36 [universally accepted] paintings, but nearly each of them has become a masterpiece. The Dutch artist from Delft was astute in his depiction of light and \\"poetic quality\\" of his subjects.

Impressionism, particularly the work of Claude Monet, played a role in the development of Benson's own American Impressionistic style. He capitalized on Monet's color palette and brush strokes and keenly depicted \\"reflected light\\", yet maintained some detail in the composition. Per Chambers, Benson represented American people with an \\"ideal of grace, of dignity, of elegance.\\"Chambers, Red and Gold.

As American Impressionism extended to Post-Impressionism about 1913, Benson stayed with traditional genres and his American Impressionist style. As a result, \\"The pretty, genteel life that Benson had depicted was criticized. Benson's reaction was to turn to nature, and birds replaced the women and children as his objects of interest.\\" said Dean Lahikainen, curator of the Peabody Essex Museum. =Marriage and children= In the summer of 1884 Benson painted at Concarneau, along with Willard Metcalf and Edward Simmons.Hiesinger, p. 233. While there, Benson became engaged to the daughter of friends from Salem, Massachusetts, Ellen Perry Peirson. They married in 1888 when Benson had established himself in his career and raised four children: Eleanor (born 1890), George (born 1891), Elisabeth (born 1892) and Sylvia (born 1898).

File:Portrait in White 1889 Frank Weston Benson.jpgPortrait of My Wife, 1889, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. =Instructor= Benson became a Portland, Maine School of Art instructor in 1886. The spring of 1889 he began teaching antique drawing at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and in 1890 became head of the Painting department. The school's reputation grew and its enrollment tripled under the leadership of Philip Hale, Benson and Edmund C. Tarbell. Students were assessed on the basis of their skill and placed at the appropriate level (from low to high): Hale had a class for beginners, Benson concentrated on how to depict figures while Tarbell covered still lifes. Benson, a favored instructor called \\"Cher Maitre\\" (\\"Dear Master\\") by his students, taught until 1913. Among his pupils were the portraitist Marie Danforth Page and the miniaturist Bertha Coolidge. Works Moonlight on the Waters oil 1899 William H. Gerdts, art historian, wrote of Benson's work in his introduction to Faith Andrews Bedford's biography of the painter: \\"Frank Benson painted some of the most beautiful pictures ever executed by an American artist. They are images alive with reflections of youth and optimism, projecting a way of life at once innocent and idealized and yet resonant with a sense of certain, selective realities of contemporary times.\\" His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. =Realism= Benson opened his first studio in Salem in 1886 with his friend, Phillip Little, and began painting portraits, an occupation in which Benson took seriously. He once said: \\"The more a painter knows about his subject, the more he studies and understands it, the more the true nature of it is perceived by whoever looks at it, even though it is extremely subtle and not easy to see or understand. A painter must search deeply into the aspects of a subject, must know and understand it thoroughly before he can represent it well.\\" Benson took a Boston studio in 1888 with Edmund C. Tarbell. He gained favorable attention in his first showing at the Society of American Artists in New York, with a piece that suggested the influence of academic Realism. At the suggestion of his friend, Joseph Lindon Smith, Benson spent several summers in Dublin from 1889 to 1893, where he painted with and was influenced by Abbott Thayer. By the early 1890s he began using his family as subjects. Benson later recalled it was then that he realized design was the most important component of painting. Consequently, works of the period evidence a greater interest in and command of pattern, silhouette, and abstract design.

Benson.jpgRed and Gold, portrait of countess Clelia de Candia, 1915, Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio =Impressionism= It was only after joining the \\"Ten American Painters\\" in 1898 that Benson shifted from the decorative painting of murals (for the Library of Congress) and allegories, to a genuine interest in plein-air Impressionism. Continuing a pattern that the Bensons would follow for years, the family left Boston during the summers. The family spent summers in New Castle, New Hampshire from 1893 to 1900, where Benson made some of his first Impressionist paintings, such as Children in the Woods and The Sisters. The popularity of The Sisters, a painting of daughters Elizabeth and Sylvia, won medals in expositions throughout the United States and in Paris, was a prelude to the successes of the next 20 years, when Benson became famous for a series of paintings of his family. After New Castle, the Bensons spent their summers on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay in Maine at Wooster Farm. Benson made Impressionist works of his family in earnest at Wooster Farm en plein air.Bedford, Frank Weston Benson Biography, p. 1-2. The summer home afforded a great view of the bay and surrounding area. Near the house was an old orchard, large fields provided plenty of space for the children to play and for a garden, and the property stood beside a wooded area. Like the French Impressionists, Benson focused on capturing light. To his daughter Eleanor he said, \\"I follow the light, where it comes from, where it goes.\\" A critic said of Benson's work: \\"It is impossible to believe that mere paint, however clearly laid on, can glow and shimmer and sparkle as does that golden light on his canvas.\\" Through his role as a teacher, work as an artist and affiliation with professional organizations for artists, Benson was a leader in American Impressionism. In 1898 Benson and nine other artists including William Merritt Chase, Thomas Dewing, Childe Hassam, and J. Alden Weir formed \\"Ten American Painters\\". They conducted annual exhibitions of their works in New York City and often showed in other cities, such as Boston, and became known as the American Impressionists. The Traditional Fine Arts Organization claimed he was \\"one of the last great American Impressionists.\\"Traditional Fine Arts Organization, Light Shines on Frank W. Benson: American Impressionist.

He used several mediums or techniques to capture his love of wildlife, including wash, watercolor, oil, lithography and etching.Bedford Biography, p. 2. Regarding his artistic mastery, Peabody Essex Museum curator Dean Lahikainen commented: \\"Benson was a unique artist, in that he had mastered so many different mediums and subjects. And from his early works right until the very end, light is what he was interested in.\\" Reminiscent of Benson's original goal as an artist to become an ornithological illustrator, birds were the subjects of most of his washes, etchings, and watercolors. Wash paintings :At the Cape Cod hunting cabin that he purchased with his brothers-in-law, Benson began working with black-and-white wash in the 1890s. The works were a commercial success, so much so that Benson was not able to keep up with the demand. Etching :In 1914, Benson began etching as an interesting pastime, one that along with his eye for aesthetics, required him to master the complex technique for the desired effect. In 1915 he first exhibited etchings of wild fowl, to popular acclaim. Benson turned increasingly to the depiction of landscapes featuring wildlife, an outgrowth of his interest in hunting and fishing. He went on to produce a steady and profitable output of etchings. Once most recognized for his Impressionist paintings, he became equally popular with his etchings. Arthur Philpott, a critic for the Boston Globe, claimed Benson was the \\"best known and most popular etcher in the world.\\" To one of his daughters he said, \\"The whole process from the bare plate to the finished print is full of fascinating possibilities and possible failures.\\" Benson, one of the best printmakers of the 20th century, is credited with making wildlife prints a distinct genre.Frank W.

A critic wrote of his watercolors, \\"The love of the almost primitive wilderness which appears in many of (Winslow) Homer's landscapes and the swift, sure touch with which he suggests rather than describes--these also characterize Benson's work. The solitude of the northern woods is very much like Homer's.\\" Benson made more than 500 watercolors in his lifetime. Oil paintings :Hunter in a Boat (1915) and Twilight (1930) are a few examples of Benson's oil paintings of wildlife settings. Benson was elected in 1919 as the first president of the Essex County Ornithological Society. At the request of fellow artist and conservationist Jay Norwood \\"Ding\\" Darling, Benson designed the second Federal Duck Stamp in 1935. =Gallery= File:Eleanor 1907 Frank Weston Benson.jpgEleanor, 1907 File:Summer 1909 Frank Weston Benson.jpgSummer, 1909 File:Elizabeth and Anna oil c.1909 Frank Weston Benson.jpgElizabeth and Ann, c.1909 File:Benson, Frank Weston - Sunlight - Google Art Project.jpgSummer, portrait of countess Rita de Candia, 1909 File:Frank Weston Benson 1909 Margaret Gretchen Strong .jpgMargaret Gretchen Strong, 1909 File:Girl Playing Solitaire oil 1909 Frank Weston Benson.jpgPlaying Solitaire oil 1909 File:Benson25.jpgThe Reader, portrait of countess Cecilia Maria de Candia, ca. 1910 File:Benson Against the Sky.jpgAgainst the Sky, ca. 1912 File:Study for Young Girl with a Veil, c. 1912.jpgStudy for Young Girl with a Veil, 1912 File:Interior-benson- greyroom.jpgThe Grey Room, 1913 File:Frank Weston Benson, The Dining Room Table, 1919.jpgThe Dining Room Table, 1919 File:Great White Herons 1923 Frank Weston Benson.jpgGreat White Herons 1923 Death and posthumous sales He is buried in Salem's Harmony Grove Cemetery. To date the highest price brought at auction for an oil painting by Benson is $4.1 million, realized at Sotheby's in 1995. Forbes.com, Beguiling Gulls. On October 19, 2006, a watercolor painting by Benson was sold at auction for $165,002. The painting was anonymously donated to an Oregon Goodwill Industries site, most likely without the owner knowing of its value. Bidding on the shopgoodwill.com website started at $10, and increased after the work was authenticated.Painting Sold at Goodwill for $165,002 Figure in a Room Figure in a Room by Frank Weston Benson, 1912, oil on canvas - New Britain Museum of American Art copy Benson's Figure in a Room, a 1912 realistic oil painting of a woman standing behind a small table in a room, was involved in a controversy that surfaced long after the death of the artist. The Detroit Club apparently purchased the painting in 1914, following an exhibit held there by Benson. At some time during the next several decades, the painting was replaced on the club's premises by an excellent fake or forgery, which was inserted into the painting's original frame. The original Benson was eventually obtained by a collector named Donald Purdy, and later by the New Britain Museum of American Art. The fake Benson painting remaining with the Detroit Club was finally sold for $38,500 to an attorney and his wife, at an auction held by Christie's in 1986. When the new owners began their own research of the painting many years later, they learned that the New Britain Museum had a strikingly similar painting from Benson in their collection; the couple's subsequent attempt to sell the painting ended when Sotheby's (who also learned of the New Britain painting) pronounced it to be a probable fake. A lawsuit was filed against Christie's, alleging negligence and/or fraud; but a Delaware Court ruled in favor of the defendants, opining that the auctioneer's fiduciary responsibility was with the seller rather than with the purchaser. The court also noted that Christie's six-year warranty of authenticity, clearly communicated, had long since expired. Today, the two \\"Figure in a Room\\" paintings involved in this controversy hang side by side at the New Britain (CT) Museum; visitors are invited to decide for themselves which is real and which is fake. Benson scholar, Faith Andrews Bedford, notes that the frame is a hand-carved frame by Wilfred Thulin, one of the members of the famed Boston school of arts and crafts framemakers. She has recently donated to the museum the mandarin coat worn by the model in the painting.

Writing notes in the book. Study skills, academic skill, or study strategies are approaches applied to learning. They are generally critical to success in school, considered essential for acquiring good grades, and useful for learning throughout one's life. Study skills are an array of skills which tackle the process of organizing and taking in new information, retaining information, or dealing with assessments. They include mnemonics, which aid the retention of lists of information; effective reading; concentration techniques; and efficient note taking.http://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/site/colleges/seh/freshinfo/vs/StudySkills2008b.pdf While often left up to the student and their support network, study skills are increasingly taught at the high school and university level. More broadly, any skill which boosts a person's ability to study, retain and recall information which assists in and passing exams can be termed a study skill, and this could include time management and motivational techniques. Study skills are discrete techniques that can be learned, usually in a short time, and applied to all or most fields of study. They must, therefore, be distinguished from strategies that are specific to a particular field of study (e.g. music or technology), and from abilities inherent in the student, such as aspects of intelligence or learning styles.  Historical context  The term study skills is used for general approaches to learning, skills for specific courses of study. There are many theoretical works on the subject, including a vast number of popular books and websites. Manuals for students have been published since the 1940s. In the 1950s and 1960s, college instructors in the fields of psychology and the study of education used to research, theory, and experience with their own students in writing manuals., Preston, Rah (1959). Teaching Study Habits and Skills, Rinehart. Original from the University of Maryland digitized August 7, 2006.Kranyik, Robert and Shankman, Florence V. (1963). How to Teach Study Skills, Teacher‚Äôs Practical Press. Marvin Cohn based the advice for parents in his 1978 book Helping Your Teen-Age Student on his experience as a researcher and head of a university reading clinic that tutored teenagers and young adults.Cohn, Marvin (1979).

Types  = Rehearsal and rote learning = Memorization is the process of committing something to memory. The act of memorization is often a deliberate mental process undertaken in order to store information in one's memory for later recall. This information can be experiences, names, appointments, addresses, telephone numbers, lists, stories, poems, pictures, maps, diagrams, facts, music or other visual, auditory, or tactical information. Memorization may also refer to the process of storing particular data into the memory of a device. One of the most basic approaches to learning any information is simply to repeat it by rote. Typically this will include reading over notes or a textbook and re-writing notes. The weakness of rote learning is that it implies a passive reading and listening style. Educators such as John Dewey have argued that students need to learn critical thinking ‚Äì questioning and weighing up evidence as they learn. This can be done during lectures or when reading books. = Reading and listening = A method that is useful during the first interaction with the subject of study is REAP method. This method helps students to improve their understanding of the text and bridge the idea with that of the author's. REAP is an acronym for Read, Encode, Annotate and Ponder. #Read: Reading a section to discern the idea. #Encode: Paraphrasing the idea from the author's perspective to the student's own words. #Annotate: Annotating the section with critical understanding and other relevant notes. #Ponder: To ponder about what they read through thinking, discussing with others and reading related materials. Thus it allows the possibility of elaboration and fulfillment of zone of proximal development. Annotating and Encoding helps reprocess content into concise and coherent knowledge which adds to a meaningful symbolic fund of knowledge. Precise annotation, Organizing question annotation, Intentional annotation, and Probe annotation are some of the annotation methods used. A student of the University of British Columbia studies for his final exams using the PQRST method. A method used to focus on key information when studying from books uncritically is the PQRST method. This method prioritizes the information in a way that relates directly to how they will be asked to use that information in an exam. PQRST is an acronym for Preview, Question, Read, Summary, Test. #Preview: The student looks at the topic to be learned by glancing over the major headings or the points in the syllabus. #Question: The student formulates questions to be answered following a thorough examination of the topic(s). #Read: The student reads through the related material, focusing on the information that best relates to the questions formulated earlier. #Summary: The student summarizes the topic, bringing his or her own understanding of the process. This may include written notes, spider diagrams, flow diagrams, labeled diagrams, mnemonics, or even voice recordings. #Test: The student answers the questions drafted earlier, avoiding adding any questions that might distract or change the subject. There are a variety of studies from different colleges nationwide that show peer-communication can help increase better study habits tremendously. One study shows that an average of 73% score increase was recorded by those who were enrolled in the classes surveyed. In order to make reading or reviewing material more engaging and active, learners can create cues that will stimulate recall later on. A cue can be a word, short phrase, or song that helps the learner access a memory that was encoded intentionally with this prompt in mind. The use of cues to aid memory has been popular for many years, however, research suggests that adopting cues made by others is not as effective as cues that learners create themselves. Self-testing is another effective practice, when preparing for exams or other standardized memory recall situations. Many students prepare for exams by simply rereading textbook passages or materials. However, it‚Äôs likely that this can create a false sense of understanding because of the increased familiarity that students have with passages that they have reviewed recently or frequently. Instead, in 2006, Roediger and Karpicke studied eighth-grade students‚Äô performance on history exams. Their results showed that students who tested themselves on material they had learned, rather than simply reviewing or rereading subjects had both better and longer lasting retention. The term Testing Effect is used to describe this increase in memory performance. Taking notes by using a computer can also deter impactful learning, even when students are using computers solely for the purpose note- taking and are not attempting to multitask, during lectures or study sessions. This is likely due to shallower processing from students using computers to take notes. Taking notes on a computer often ushers a tendency for students to record lectures verbatim, instead of writing the points of a lecture in their own words. Speed reading, while trainable, results in lower accuracy, comprehension, and understanding.https://espressoscience.com/2017/02/15/the- fiction-and-facts-of-speed-reading/ = Flashcard training = Flashcards are visual cues on cards. These have numerous uses in teaching and learning but can be used for revision. Students often make their own flashcards, or more detailed index cards ‚Äì cards designed for filing, often A5 size, on which short summaries are written. Being discrete and separate, they have the advantage of allowing students to re-order them, pick a selection to read over, or choose randomly for self-testing. Software equivalents can be used. = Summary methods = Summary methods vary depending on the topic, but most involve condensing the large amount of information from a course or book into shorter notes. Often, these notes are then condensed further into key facts. Organized summaries: Such as outlines showing keywords and definitions and relations, usually in a tree structure. Spider diagrams: Using spider diagrams or mind maps can be an effective way of linking concepts together. They can be useful for planning essays and essay responses in exams. These tools can give a visual summary of a topic that preserves its logical structure, with lines used to show how different parts link together. =Visual imagery = Some learners are thought to have a visual learning style, and will benefit greatly from taking information from their studies which are often heavily verbal, and using visual techniques to help encode and retain it in memory. Some memory techniques make use of visual memory. One popular memory enhancing technique is the method of loci, a system of visualizing key information in real physical locations e.g. around a room. Diagrams are often underrated tools. They can be used to bring all the information together and provide practice reorganizing what has been learned in order to produce something practical and useful. They can also aid the recall of information learned very quickly, particularly if the student made the diagram while studying the information. Pictures can then be transferred to flashcards that are very effective last- minute revision tools rather than rereading any written material. = Acronyms and mnemonics = A mnemonic is a method of organizing and memorizing information. Some use a simple phrase or fact as a trigger for a longer list of information. For example, the cardinal points of the compass can be recalled in the correct order with the phrase \\"Never Eat Shredded Wheat\\". Starting with North, the first letter of each word relates to a compass point in clockwise order round a compass. =Exam strategies = The Black-Red-Green method (developed through the Royal Literary Fund) helps the student to ensure that every aspect of the question posed has been considered, both in exams and essays.Royal Literary Fund: Mission Possible: the Study Skills Pack http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/mission_possible.cfm The student underlines relevant parts of the question using three separate colors (or some equivalent). BLAck denotes 'BLAtant instructions', i.e. something that clearly must be done; a directive or obvious instruction. REd is a REference Point or REquired input of some kind, usually to do with definitions, terms, cited authors, theory, etc. (either explicitly referred to or strongly implied). GREen denotes GREmlins, which are subtle signals one might easily miss, or a ‚ÄòGREEN Light‚Äô that gives a hint on how to proceed, or where to place the emphasis in answers . Another popular method whilst studying is to P.E.E; Point, evidence and explain, reason being, this helps the student break down exam questions allowing them to maximize their marks/grade during the exam. Many Schools will encourage practicing the P.E. BEing method prior to an exam. = Spacing = Spacing, also called distributed learning by some; helps individuals remember at least as much if not more information for a longer period of time than using only one study skill. Using spacing in addition to other study methods can improve retention and performance on tests. Spacing is especially useful for retaining and recalling new material. The theory of spacing allows students to split that a single long session to a few shorter sessions in a day, if not days apart, instead of cramming all study materials into one long study session that lasts for hours. Studying will not last longer than it would have originally, and one is not working harder but this tool gives the user the ability to remember and recall things for a longer time period. Spacing effect is not only beneficial for memorization, but spaced repetition can also potentially improve classroom learning. The science behind this; according to Jost‚Äôs Law from 1897 ‚ÄúIf two associations are of equal strength but of different age, a new repetition has a greater value for the older one‚Äù. This means that if a person were to study two things once, at different times, the one studied most recently will be easier to recall. = Interleaving and blocking = Blocking is studying one topic at a time. Interleaving is another technique used to enhance learning and memory; it involves practicing and learning multiple related skills or topics. For example, when training three skills A, B and C: blocking uses the pattern of AAA-BBB-CCC while interleaving uses the pattern of ABC-ABC-ABC. Research has found that interleaving is superior to blocking in learning skills and studying. = Retrieval and testing = One of the most efficient methods of learning is trying to retrieve learned information and skills. This could be achieved by many ways including: testing, quizzing, self-testing, problem-solving, active recall, flashcards, practicing the skills, and other. = Time management, organization and lifestyle changesCollege Success: Study Strategies and Skills, Jean A. Reynolds, ¬©1996 by Allyn & Bacon, Boston = Often, improvements to the effectiveness of study may be achieved through changes to things unrelated to the study material itself, such as time-management, boosting motivation and avoiding procrastination, and in improvements to sleep and diet. Time management in study sessions aims to ensure that activities that achieve the greatest benefit are given the greatest focus. A traffic lights system is a simple way of identifying the importance of information, highlighting or underlining information in colours: * Green: topics to be studied first; important and also simple * Amber: topics to be studied next; important but time-consuming * Red: lowest priority; complex and not vital. This reminds students to start with the things which will provide the quickest benefit, while 'red' topics are only dealt with if time allows. The concept is similar to the ABC analysis, commonly used by workers to help prioritize. Also, some websites (such as FlashNotes) can be used for additional study materials and may help improve time management and increase motivation. In addition to time management, sleep is important; getting adequate rest improves memorisation.Study Efficiently TeenLife Media, January, 2015 Students are generally more productive in the morning than the afternoon.http://home.uchicago.edu/~npope/morning_afternoon.pdf In addition to time management and sleep, emotional state of mind can matter when a student is studying. If an individual is calm or nervous in class; replicating that emotion can assist in studying. With replicating the emotion, an individual is more likely to recall more information if they are in the same state of mind when in class. This also goes the other direction; if one is upset but normally calm in class it‚Äôs much better to wait until they are feeling calmer to study. At the time of the test or class they will remember more. While productivity is greater earlier in the day, current research suggests that material studied in the afternoon or evening is better consolidated and retained. This is consistent with current memory consolidation models that student tasks requiring analysis and application are better suited toward the morning and midday while learning new information and memorizing are better suited to evenings. The Pomodoro Method is another effective way of increasing the productivity a set amount of time, by limiting interruptions. Invented in Germany in the 1980s, the Pomodoro Method segments blocks of time into 30-minute sections. Each 30-minute section (called a Pomodoro) is composed of a 25-minute study or work period and a 5-minute rest period. And it is recommended that every4 Pomodoro‚Äôs, should be followed with a 15-30-minute break. Though this technique has increased in popularity, it hadn‚Äôt been empirically studied until more recently. A software engineering corporation found that employees using the Pomodoro Method saw a decrease in their work flow interruptions and an increase in their satisfaction. by being mindful of wasted time during study, students can increase their learning productivity. Journaling can help students increase their academic performance principally through reducing stress and anxiety. Much of students‚Äô difficulty or aversion to analytic subjects such as math or science, is due to a lack of confidence or belief that learning is reasonably within their abilities. Therefore, reducing the stress of learning new and/or complex material is paramount to helping them succeed. Students without access to an outside source of support can use journaling to simulate a similar environment and effect. For example, Frattaroli, et al, studied students that were preparing to take graduate study entrance exams, such as the GRE, LSAT, and MCAT. They found that students‚Äô journal entries recorded immediately before taking these historically stress- inducing tests followed a similar logical flow; where during the beginning of writing, participants would express fear or concern toward the test. However, through the course of writing their experiences down, participants would encourage themselves and ultimately cultivate hope in upcoming exams. As a result of this, those who journaled immediately before these tests reported a lower amount of anxiety, and a better test result. = Study environment = Studying can also be more effective if one changes their environment while studying. For example: the first time studying the material, one can study in a bedroom, the second time one can study outside, and the final time one can study in a coffee shop. The thinking behind this is that as when an individual changes their environment the brain associates different aspects of the learning and gives a stronger hold and additional brain pathways with which to access the information. In this context environment can mean many things; from location, to sounds, to smells, to other stimuli including foods. When discussing environment in regards to its effect on studying and retention Carey says ‚Äúa simple change in venue improved retrieval strength (memory) by 40 percent.‚Äù Another change in the environment can be background music; if people study with music playing and they are able to play the same music during test time they will recall more of the information they studied. According to Carey ‚Äúbackground music weaves itself subconsciously into the fabric of stored memory.‚Äù This ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù in the background helps to create more vivid memories with the studied material. A study done by Anderson, et al, displayed a detrimental effect that listening to lyrical and popular music has on students‚Äô memorization performance. While in some cases listening to music can improve students‚Äô ability to memorize information overly distracting or captivating music can have a harmful effect. Therefore, the purpose in listening to music during a study session is to create a moderate distraction from learning, which will increase performance, without listening to music that provides a distraction that is too occupying to allow learners to maintain focus on memorizing. Homework completion is typically irrelevant to academic performance.http://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/news/the-homework- debate-the-case-against-homework/{dead linkdate=Oktober 2020} =Analogies= Analogies can be a highly effective way to increase the efficiency of coding and long-term memory. Popular uses of analogies are often forming visual images that represent subject matter, linking words or information to one‚Äôs self, and either imagining or creating diagrams that display the relationship between elements of complex concepts. A 1970 study done by Bower and Winzez found that as participants created analogies that had sentimentality or relevance to themselves as a unique individual, they were better able to store information as well as recall what had been studied. This is referred to as the Self-reference Effect. Adding to this phenomenon, examples that are more familiar an individual or that are more vivid or detailed are even more easily remembered. However, analogies that are logically flawed and/or are not clearly described can create misleading or superficial models in learners. =Concept mapping= There is some support for the efficacy of concept mapping as a learning tool.

Though a commoner, and thus not officially of the samurai class, Yui was known as one of the \\"Three Great R≈çnin\\" along with Kumazawa Banzan and Yamaga Sok≈ç. Born in Sunpu Domain to humble origins, Yui is said to have been a talented youth; he was taken in by a number of r≈çnin from the area, who taught him recent history, and likely swordsmanship and military strategy as well. As an adult, he found employment as an instructor at a samurai academy, teaching swordsmanship and related disciplines. But these academies, which could be found throughout the country, served not only the pure function of schools of martial arts; certainly, discipline, ethics, and related arts were taught as well. But the schools also served as social and intellectual spaces, in which political ideas were discussed, and grievances aired in a familiar environment where comrades and friends met. Students were almost exclusively members of the samurai class, but running the full gamut of rankings, from daimy≈ç to ronin. As regulations were made stricter at this time, and many ronin expelled from their domains, the number of students grew dramatically. He later opened a school of military strategy and martial arts in the Renjaku-ch≈ç neighborhood of Kanda in Edo, as well as an armorer's shop and ironworks. Here he continued to gain contacts, friends, and prestige among the ronin and others; one of them was Marubashi Ch≈´ya, a samurai and fellow instructor of martial disciplines and strategy, with whom he would plan the Keian Uprising some years later. Beginning in 1645, Yui plotted a coup against the Tokugawa shogunate along with Marubashi, a small group of r≈çnin, and a number of their students. It was to take place in 1651, shortly after the death of sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu, and would later come to be known as the Keian Uprising. Unfortunately for Yui and his comrades, the plot was discovered before it truly began. Yui was in Sunpu, preparing to execute a secondary series of attacks when Marubashi was arrested in Edo; surrounded by shogunate officials, he committed seppuku rather than be captured. Following his death, the officials performed a variety of obscenities upon his body, and then proceeded to subject his parents and other close relatives to crucifixion. Yui, though ultimately unsuccessful in his political plots, is a representative of the growing political unrest in the early Edo period, as a result of strict laws put forth, and enforced, by the shogunate. He and his conspirators were only one of many groups throughout the country meeting in samurai academies and other venues, discussing politics and current events. Most, of course, did not act upon their beliefs as Yui and Marubashi did, but that discussion existed among a great number of people, despite, or perhaps because of the shogunate's strict enforcement of its laws, is significant.

During his first term as LAPD chief, Davis emphasized firearms training. Under Davis, the LAPD developed its lasting reputation as an organization that relied on brute force to enforce public order. It also became very publicly entangled in corruption. Members of the LAPD were revealed to have undertaken a campaign of brutal harassment, including the bombings of political reformers who had incurred the wrath of the department and the civic administration. Under Chief Davis, civil service reforms were implemented in the City Charter via the ballot initiative process that insulated the police department from political influence. Career =First term= James E. Davis made a name for himself in the department as the head of the vice squad during Prohibition. When Chief Davis created a \\"gun squad\\" staffed with 50 policemen, he made a public pronouncement that \\"the gun-toting element and the rum smugglers are going to learn that murder and gun-toting are most inimical to their best interest.\\" Davis declared that the LAPD \\"would \\"hold court on gunmen in the Los Angeles streets; I want them brought in dead, not alive and will reprimand any officer who shows the least mercy to a criminal.\\" For his efforts, he won the moniker \\"Two-Gun Davis.\\" The primary \\"targets\\" of Davis' department were purveyors of vice, radicals, and vagrants. Davis was a proponent of the use of radio in police work. In 1929, he ordered his staff to investigate the use of radio for dispatching officers. However, it was up to his successor, Roy E. Steckel, to put the radio in L.A.P.D. vehicles. =Second term= After being succeeded by and succeeding Police Chief Roy E. Steckel, Davis served as chief from 1933 to 1939. In his second-go-round as chief, Davis developed a reputation as a reformer. Under Chief Steckel, departmental regulations forbidding the solicitation of rewards or the acceptance of gratuities by policemen had lapsed; Davis reimplemented the restrictions. He also fired 245 police officers for misconduct in the first four years of his second term. However, in reality, Two-Gun Davis was to serve one of the most corrupt mayors in Los Angeles history, Frank L. Shaw, who had been elected despite the opposition of the Chandler Family, conservatives who owned the powerful Los Angeles Times newspaper. (The 1910 L.A. Times building bombing had been carried out by a union member, upset with the anti-union stance of publisher Harrison Gray Otis, whose son-in-law Harry Chandler would take over as publisher of the Times in 1917. The bombing killed 21 newspaper employees and injured 100.) To curry favor with the Chandlers, Shaw appointed Davis chief. Chandler was fiercely anti-labor, and Davis, as chief, could provide police muscle to discourage unionization. Davis formed a \\"Red Squad\\" in order to \\"investigate and control radical activities, strikes, and riots.\\" According to the Official LAPD website, one Police Commissioner declared his support for Davis' Red Squad, saying, \\"The more the police beat them up and wreck their headquarters, the better. Communists have no Constitutional rights and I won't listen to anyone who defends them.\\" Mayor Shaw appointed his campaign manager, James \\"Sunny Jimmy\\" Bolger, to serve as Davis' secretary, in order to keep a tight rein on the Chief. Under Chief Davis, the LAPD would become mired in corruption, becoming active agents in the promotion of vice. =Police academy= Starting in 1933, Davis began transforming the pistol range and related facilities of the Los Angeles Police Revolver and Athletic Club (LAPRAAC) in Elysian Park into a true training facility for recruits. Police recruits had begun training in an armory located in Elysian Park in 1924. The LAPRAAC had been founded as a private club in 1925 by LAPD officers to practice their marksmanship. In 1932, their range was used during the 1932 Summer Olympics for shooting events. In recognition, the Olympic Committee donated the dormitory used as the Olympic Village, and the dormitory building was dismantled and reassembled at the site of the range in Elysian Fields. The building would eventually house the restaurant for the new training facility that would become the LAPD's Police Academy. From 1935 to 1995, all recruits were trained at the Elysian Field site, when the new Recruit Training Center was opened in Westchester. The Elysian Park facilities, the legacy of Chief Davis, are to be used for in-service training. The rules and regulations for the new Police Academy were drafted by L.A.P.D Lieutenant William H. Parker, who would go on to become Chief of Police in 1950. Parker also drafted civil service reforms enacted into the City's charter that were designed to protect the chief and police personnel from political interference. Charter Amendment 14-A, which was passed by the electorate in April 1937, changed City Charter Section 1999 so that the Chief of Police could not be removed without a hearing before the L.A. Board of Civil Service Commissioners. =East Coast Crime Syndicate= During Davis' second term as chief, New York mobster Bugsy Siegel arrived in Los Angeles with a mandate from his partners in the National Crime Syndicate to put Southern California vice rackets under top-down control. To serve as Siegel's enforcer, Mickey Cohen was moved into Los Angeles from Chicago. Siegel quietly and quickly seized control of vice operations in the region, which put him at odds with local racketeers, especially Jack Dragna and Guy McAfee. As a result of the reform election of 1938, McAfee and others who'd operated the \\"Combination\\" moved their operations to Las Vegas, clearing the field for Siegel and his East Coast partners. After Siegel's assassination in June 1947, Cohen was anointed head of the national syndicate's operations in the Southwest - a move that sparked a gang war in Los Angeles. Corruption continued to flourish in Los Angeles. Davis' successor, Chief Clemence B. Horrall, retired on June 28, 1949, amid the LAPD Vice Scandals, which erupted after LAPD whistleblower Sgt. Charles Stoker alleged that Hollywood madam Brenda Allen had paid into a protection racket operated by senior LAPD Vice officers who reported directly to the Chief.\\"Horrall Retires as Police Chief; Gives Health as His Reason,\\" Los Angeles Times, pg. 1, June 29, 1949 Controversy During his first stint as Police Chief, Davis was involved in the scandal surrounding the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. For several months in 1936, during the height of the devastation from the \\"Dust Bowl\\", Chief Davis sent LAPD to the California-Arizona border in an attempt to stop the flow of migrants. These migrants were commonly referred to as \\"Okies\\", named for the early migrants who fled Oklahoma after the state was ravaged by the Dust Bowl. In 1930s became near to fascism, he supported Adolf Hitler's policies against Jews. =Corruption= In 1937, restaurateur Clifford Clinton, a reform-minded businessman who ran a chain of cafeteria-style restaurants, got himself appointed to the Los Angeles County grand jury. Clinton proved to be a gadfly who demanded an investigation of vice in Los Angeles, and was turned down by the grand jury foreman. Angered, he went to Mayor Shaw, who endorsed an independent committee, CIVIC (Citizens Independent Vice Investigating Committee) over the objections of Chief Davis. A corrupt politician who eventually was recalled from office in 1938, Mayor Shaw soon regretted his decision. CIVIC and its citizen volunteers discovered that vice was rampant in Los Angeles. The profits from 600 brothels, 1,800 bookmaking operations, 23,000 slot machines and prostitution were being used to finance political elections, and the LAPD was working hand-in-hand with the underworld. The grand jury rejected CIVIC's report, and after seeking the advice of Superior Court Judge Fletcher Bowron (who had overseen a grand jury that nearly brought down L.A. District Attorney Buron Fitts for corruption), CIVIC issued a minority report that was only published after Judge Bowron's intervention. A notary public that testified before the grand jury that the foreman was a corrupt ally of Mayor Shaw was beaten by police at his own home in the presence of Fitts and the grand jury foreman. Clinton was harassed by city officials, who boosted his taxes and denied him a license to open up a new cafeterias, while the Los Angeles Times attacked him and his restaurant chain. Then his home was bombed, most likely by members of the LAPD secret Intelligence Squad, and the backlash enveloped Mayor Shaw and Chief Davis. The Intelligence Squad wiretapped Clinton's home, as well as the home of Judge Bowron and other members of the reform movement. A second bombing brought down Mayor Shaw. Investigator Harry Raymond, a former policeman who worked as a private investigator and was digging up dirt on the Shaw administration, survived a car bombing on January 14, 1937. The bomb was planted by LAPD Captain Earl Kynette, who headed a secret intelligence unit that had Raymond under surveillance. The LAPD and the Los Angeles Times, which was in league with D.A. Fitts, said the bombing was a publicity stunt staged by Clinton and Raymond, but witnesses testified that the police had had Clinton's house under surveillance. Seven members of the intelligence squad refused to testify before the grand jury, pledging their right not to incriminate themselves. Captain Kynette later was convicted of the bombing. District Attorney Fitts and Chief Davis began a desultory investigation that led the director of the L.A. Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to U.S. Senator Hiram Johnson, which called Fitts a psychopath. The public outcry led to Mayor Shaw being recalled by voters in 1938 and the election of Judge Bowron as mayor. Davis was called as a witness at the trial of Captain Kynette. It was revealed that the LAPD had been operating a vast intelligence operation targeting not only reformers but politicians, judges, and even a federal agent investigating corruption in San Francisco. Chief Davis did poorly on the stand and he was forced from office by Mayor Bowron, who went on to sack many of the senior officers of the LAPD. Later life and death Davis died of stroke at a Montana ranch in 1949.\\"JE DAVIS, RETIRED POLICE CHIEF, DIES.\\" Los Angeles Times, Jun 21, 1949.

Numerous works of literature, television, and films feature characters who have prosthetics attached. Prosthetics are used, in a narrative sense, to either, provide a plot point in the characters back-story, a plot point to give to character a disability (or more often in Science fiction, an advantage), or just to distinguish the character in some way. Having a character in a story with a prostheses, can sometimes be the whole point of the story (e.g. Robocop is a full-body cyborg of police officer Alex Murphy, in essence he is a human/robot police officer, which is the basic premise for the film). Science fiction characters Science fiction literature, television, and films often feature characters with prosthetics. =Star Trek= * Geordi La Forge - Blind from birth, La Forge received prosthetics that allowed him to see. During the television series and Star Trek Generations, he had bio-implants along with an external VISOR prosthetic. * Jean-Luc Picard - Early in his career, Picard was stabbed through the heart during a fight and required the implantation of an artificial heart to save his life. At the end of the third season, he was abducted and assimilated by the Borg. The Borg attached numerous prosthetics to Picard against his will. * Seven of Nine - Originally a young human female known as Annika Hansen, she and her parents were captured by the Borg when Annika was six. She was also assimilated into the Borg Collective, where numerous prosthetics were attached to her. After she was separated from the collective and taken aboard Voyager as a crew member, most of the prosthetics were removed except for the ones on/near her left hand, left eye, and right ear. * Nog - the Ferengi Ensign, the first of his kind in Starfleet, lost his leg during hostilities with the Dominion; an artificial leg was later installed and Nog had a prolonged psychological recovery. =Star Wars= * Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader - Anakin Skywalker lost his right arm during the Battle of Geonosis when he dueled with Count Dooku. Afterwards, he received a replacement arm and hand. After becoming Darth Vader, Vader fought with Obi-Wan Kenobi which resulted in his losing both legs and his other arm. He also suffered severe burns in the aftermath of the battle - his lungs, and ear drums were seriously damaged. Vader was forced to wear a breathing mask and monitor to compensate for his heavily damaged lungs, and was fitted with prosthetic limbs to replace those lost. His right hand was cut off again in Return of the Jedi. * Luke Skywalker - Anakin's son Luke Skywalker lost his right hand when he dueled Darth Vader at Cloud City. Luke was rescued by his friends, and was then fitted with a prosthetic hand. * General Grievous - Formerly a Kaleesh general, he was severely wounded in a shuttle bombing. He was later reconstructed by the Intergalactic Banking Clan as a cyborg, with his only organic remains encased inside a synthflesh sack within his durasteel skeleton. =Babylon 5= * G'Kar - While being held by Centauri forces, G'Kar lost his left eye after a Centauri guard cut it out. After being freed by Londo Mollari in the wake of the insane Emperor Cartagia's death, G'Kar was fitted with a replacement eye by Dr. Franklin. Initially, he had a human blue eye, this was later replaced with a red eye that looked like a natural Narn eye. =RoboCop= * In the first RoboCop film, Detroit police officer Alex Murphy was shot numerous times by a group of criminals and mortally wounded. His body was taken by OCP scientists - who then took his brain, eyes, peripheral nervous system and possibly other portions of his body and installed them inside an artificial, titanium-armored humanoid body. As intended, he became the cyborg Robocop. * In the second film, criminal leader and drug addict Kane underwent a similar treatment; he became the hulking and nearly indestructible Robocop II, but was still psychotic and addicted to the drug Nuke. =Kingsman: The Secret Service= * In the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service, Gazelle, the assistant and right-hand of Richmond Valentine, has a pair of blade-equipped prosthetic legs that she uses that dispatch her enemies. * In the 2017 sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Charlie Hesketh, a former Kingsman trainee turned enforcer for drug kingpin Poppy Adams, wears a prosthetic arm to replace the one he lost during the Kingsman assault on Valentine's compound. Even when detached from his body, the arm can be operated via remote control and hack into the Kingsman computer system. Other fiction In Homestuck, Vriska Serket loses her eye and arm in an explosion. She receives a robotic arm from Equius Zahhak to replace it. In Evil Dead, the main character Ash Williams has a chainsaw hand and later receives a robot hand in Army of Darkness. In the myriad of Peter Pan stories and franchises, Captain Hook has a hook replacing his right hand which was eaten by a crocodile. In Flannery O'Connor's story \\"Good Country People\\", the character Joy Hopewell/Hulga's leg was blasted off in a childhood hunting accidents and she used a wooden leg instead that becomes important to the plot. In The Fugitive television series and subsequent film, the fugitive Dr. Richard Kimble searches for the one armed man who killed his wife. In the film version, the one armed man also received a transplant - who was played by Andreas Katsulas. As a result, this would be another role in addition to his Babylon 5 role in which he received a prosthetic device. In the novel Moby- Dick, as well as various productions based on the novel, Captain Ahab is a man who loses one of his legs to the great sperm whale Moby Dick. After losing his leg, a replacement of sorts is fashioned. This \`wooden leg¬¥, actually carved out of whalebone, let him walk with minimal difficulty. The loss of this leg would fuel Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick, which cost him his ship, crew, and his life. Mister Ming, the main antagonist of the Bob Morane books, has a robotic prosthesis instead of his right hand, which was lost during an attempt to steal a booby trapped gemstone. In the manga and anime Ghost in the Shell, people whose bodies have been damaged or people who can simply afford it have their normal bodies replaced with a full prosthetic replacement. The main character, Motoko Kusanagi, is fully prosthetic. The Manga/Anime Galaxy Express 999 also features an array of main characters who have sacrificed their human bodies in order to occupy prosthetic machine bodies in order to become immortal. The 2011 video game Deus Ex: Human Revolution likewise centers around a future in which prosthetics have become commonplace. The television series The Six Million Dollar Man and its spinoff The Bionic Woman both featured main characters whose replacement parts gave them abilities above those of normal people. In the Harry Potter novel series, Alastor \\"Mad- Eye\\" Moody has an artificial eye (able to see through solids) and a wooden leg to compensate for wounds he received during his career as an Auror. Wormtail, Voldemort's assistant, also receives a replacement hand. In the first-person shooter computer game Half-Life 2, Dr. Eli Vance uses a prosthetic leg after losing his own leg below the knee helping his colleague Dr. Isaac Kleiner over a wall while escaping Black Mesa in the original \\"Half-Life\\" game. In the Kingpin (1996 film), Roy Munsen has a prosthetic right hand after break his hand. The character Rotwang from the film Metropolis has a black mechanical right hand after losing it for unknown reasons. Because Rotwang is an early \\"mad scientist\\" archetype, it is believed that this influenced other characters, such as Dr. Julius No (who, in the novel, had jointed metal claws; in the movie, however, he possessed actual artificial hands). In the Akira manga and anime Tetsuo Shima, one of the main characters, loses his right arm and it is replaced by a mechanical limb. In the anime he's seen assembling the arm from pieces of junk using his supernatural powers, while in the manga the origin of the mechanical arm is unknown. A running gag in the film Hot Shots! and its sequel is Lloyd Bridges's character, Thomas 'Tug' Bensen, featuring various prosthetics that replace parts he had lost in earlier battles. These prosthetics include; ceramic eyes, asbestos skin, a magnetic skull plate, aluminum siding facial bones, and stainless steel ear canals. In the novel The Horse Whisperer (and the film of the same name), Grace MacLean loses part of her right leg when she is involved in a horseback riding accident, and struck by a large truck. She gets a prosthetic leg, and learns how to walk on it and ride again. The character Peeta Mellark from The Hunger Games loses his left leg at the end of the novel, after surviving a bad wound and blood poisoning. However, when he is attacked by one of the Mutts, the wound is bad enough that it later causes the leg to be amputated by the capitol. He is given a replacement prosthetic leg. In the manga and anime Black Butler, some of the members of the Noah's Ark Circus have prosthetic limbs. These people are Joker (Right hand), Beast (Left leg) and Dagger (Right leg). However, it is revealed that these limbs are in fact made from human bone. Also, Joker's prosthetic hand is shaped to look skeletal. In the manga and anime Fullmetal Alchemist, the main protagonist Edward Elric loses his left leg in a failed attempt to resurrect his mother Trisha Elric through the use of human transmutation, a forbidden practice in alchemy, while his brother Alphonse Elric lost his whole body in the process. He then successfully used human transmutation once again to bind the soul of his brother to a suit of armor, losing his right arm in the process. Later he replaced the missing limbs with prosthetic limbs known as automail, which are robotic appendages that are connected to the very nerves in the human body, granting the user the ability to use them just as they would with their actual limbs. In the How to Train Your Dragon film series, the main character, Hiccup, walks using a prosthetic foot after losing his real one during a battle at the end of the first film; his dragon has a prosthetic replacement for one side of its tailplane which it lost early or was missing from hatching. (The first film explains that the dragon's tail fin was lost when Hiccup attempted to capture and kill the dragon.) In Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain the video game main character Punished \\"Venom\\" Snake is outfitted with a prosthetic Bionic Arm after a helicopter crash. Later in the game upgrades for the arm can be developed giving it the ability to fly like a missile as a \\"Rocket Punch\\", stun enemies with an electrical shock, or grab an enemy from far away with electromagnetic probes. In A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, Jaime Lannister gets captured and maimed by the Brave Companions, a swellsword company, and loses his right hand, his sword hand. Being the best sword fighter in the Seven Kingdoms the loss of his hand means he loses more than just his hand. He has to re-invent himself. Back in Kings Landing with his family, he gets a prosthetic hand made of pure gold. In the TV show ER, Dr. Romano's arm is amputated in Season 9 and in Season 10 he receives a robotic arm. In the web series RWBY, Yang Xiao Long is enraged at the sight of Adam Taurus stabbing her partner Blake Belladonna in the torso, so she attempts to punch him. Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful as he had sliced off her right arm, which tore through her Aura and caused her to pass out. In Volume 4, her father then gets her a new prosthetic arm which was provided by General Ironwood. Near the end of the Volume, she spray paints her mechanical arm black and yellow. In the film Captain America: The Winter Soldier after falling from a train in the prior Captain America film, a flashback shows James Buchanan \\"Bucky\\" Barnes being picked up by Hydra and his injured left arm is amputated and replaced with some kind of mechanical prosthetic. The prosthetic appears to be fairly advanced at the time, and maintains its advanced form throughout the film, even in the present. It appears to be extremely powerful, able to withstand Black Widow's electric taser darts with little effect, and makes him almost capable of outmatching Captain America. It's seen again in Civil War, and is replaced with a new arm that is implied heavily to be vibranium in Infinity War. Ulysses Klaue, a supervillain, has his arm chopped off by Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron and his replacement arm is made of vibranium. In the young adult realistic fiction novel The Running Dream, the protagonist Jessica is a runner who loses a leg in a bus accident on her way home from a race. With the help of her community, Jessica's family saves enough money to buy her a prosthetic leg designed for running. Stanis≈Çaw Lem's 1955 science fiction comedy radio play Are you there, Mr. Jones? (and the 1969 BBC TV play Roly Poly based on it) humorously deals with a legal issue, a kind of the paradox of the heap: if a person gradually adds prostheses until the body is completely replaced, whether the person remains a human (with legal obligations of the such) or he becomes a machine (which cannot be sued, but can become someone's property). In the TV series Adventure Time, Finn Mertens' right arm is amputated twice. Once in its 6th season and the second time in its 8th season.

History Yelwa has been the capital of the Yauri Emirate since 1888, when the capital was moved there from Bin Yauri following a civil war. In 1896, the Royal Niger Company established a trading post in Yauri. The town was occupied by the British in 1901. Part of Yelwa was permanently flooded by the creation of the Kainji Dam in 1986. Almost half of the residents of Yauri, including many in Yelwa, were displaced by the construction of the Kainji Dam, which has had detrimental effects on agriculture in the area. A massacre occurred in 2004. On 16 February 2018, a Martian crater was named after Yelwa.

Hodge. It was proposed to exist in central Oregon at the present day location of the Three Sisters region. It was estimated to have been around tall, and was believed destroyed in a fashion similar to Mount Mazama's eruption resulting in what is now Crater Lake in southern Oregon. In 1924, Hodge performed fieldwork around the area and concluded that the three adjacent volcanoes and their foothills were once part of a single giant volcano. His conclusion was bolstered by oral history from the local Warm Springs tribe, which recounted the massive eruption and collapse of the ancient peak. : Klah Klahnee, the Three Sisters, was once the biggest and highest mountain of all; it could be seen for many miles. One time the earth shook for days, and the mountain boiled inside. It boiled over, and hot rocks came out of the top of it. Flames and smoke rose high in the air. Red hot stones were thrown out in every direction. Many villages and many Indians were buried by the rocks. When the mountain became quiet again, most of it was gone. Only three points were left. The date of eruption that Hodge calculated using the potassium-argon method was 25 million to 27 million years ago. This predates the earliest estimates of human presence in North America (see Settlement of the Americas) and even the earliest known humans (see Archaic Homo sapiens). Years later, Howel Williams, then dean of Cascade volcanologists, concluded that each of the Three Sisters and their surrounding mountains were unique and did not represent remains of a single collapsed structure. quoting Stephen L.

Their job is not to help the driver see the road but to help other road users see the vehicle.Daytime running light European Commission Implementations Full-voltage vs. parking light headlamp on European-market Volkswagen Depending on prevailing regulations and equipment, vehicles may implement the daytime-running light function by functionally turning on specific lamps, by operating low-beam headlamps or fog lamps at full or reduced intensity, by operating high-beam headlamps at reduced intensity, or by steady-burning operation of the front-turn signals. Compared to any mode of headlamp operation to produce the daytime running light, functionally dedicated DRLs maximize the potential benefits in safety performance, glare, motorcycle masking, and other potential drawbacks. Usage A daytime running lamp is usually automatically switched on once the ignition is on. A daytime running lamp emits a brighter light when the headlamps are not turned on and its brightness will be dimmed slightly in conjunction with the headlamps being turned on. Safety performance A 2008 study by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysed the effect of DRLs on frontal and side-on crashes between two vehicles and on vehicle collisions with pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. The analysis determined that DRLs offer no statistically significant reduction in the frequency or severity of the collisions studied, except for a reduction in light trucks' and vans' involvement in two-vehicle crashes by a statistically significant 5.7%. =Effect of ambient light= The daytime running light was first mandated, and safety benefits first perceived, in Scandinavian countries where it is persistently dark during the winter season. As ambient light levels increase, the potential safety benefit decreases while the DRL intensity required for a safety improvement increases. The safety benefit produced by DRLs in relatively dark Nordic countries is roughly triple the benefit observed in relatively bright United States. Effect on motorcycle safety A number of motorcycling advocacy groups are concerned over reduced motorcycle conspicuity and increased vulnerability with the introduction of headlamp-based DRLs on cars and other dual-track vehicles, since it means motorcycles are no longer the only vehicles displaying headlamps during the day. Some researchers have suggested that amber DRLs be reserved for use exclusively on motorcycles, in countries where amber is not presently a permissible color for DRLs on any vehicles, while other research has concluded there is a safety disbenefit to two 90 mm x 520 candela (cd) DRLs on motorcycles in comparison to one 190 mm x 270 cd dipped (low) beam headlight. The latter result suggests that DRL luminous area may have an important influence on its effectiveness. Environmental impact LED daytime running lights on Audi A4 DRL power consumption varies widely depending on the implementation. Current production DRL systems consume from 5 watts (dedicated LED system) to over 200 W (headlamps and all parking, tail, and marker lights on). International regulators, primarily in Europe, are working to balance the potential safety benefit offered by DRL with the increased fuel consumption due to their use. Because the power to run the DRLs must be produced by the engine, which in turn requires burning additional fuel, high-power DRL systems increase CO2 emissions sufficiently to affect a country's compliance with the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas emissions.DRL fuel consumption calculations For that reason, low-power solutions are being encouraged and headlamp-based systems are not allowed after DRLs became mandatory in Europe at the beginning of 2011. LEDs and low-power, high-efficacy, long-life light bulbs produce appropriate amounts of light for an effective DRL without significantly increasing fuel consumption or emissions. Fuel consumption reductions of up to 0.5 mpg may be found when comparing a 55 W DRL system to a 200 W DRL system. In 2006, the UK's Department of Transport also found significant reductions in emissions and fuel consumption when comparing a 42 W DRL system to a 160 W full headlight DRL systems. DRL fuel consumption can be reduced to insignificant levels by the use of 8 to 20 W DRL systems based on LEDs or high-efficacy filament bulbs.

Directive 2008/89/EC DRLs compliant with R87 emit white light on axis of between 400 and 1,200 candela with an apparent surface of 25 cm2 to 200 cm2 with an additional requirement of between 1 and 1,200 candela in a defined field.ECE Regulation 87, Revision 2 In the past, Germany, Spain, France and other European countries have encouraged or required daytime use of low beam headlamps on certain roads at certain times of year; Ireland encourages the use of low beam headlights during the winter, Italy, Hungary and Romania require daytime running lamps outside populated areas, and Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia require the use of full or reduced voltage low beam headlights at all times. Whether this requirement is met by the DRLs required on new cars since February 2011 is a matter of individual countries' laws. Nordic countries Hella DRL retrofit kit in selective yellow offered in Sweden in the 1970s. Package text reads \\"Install Hella perception lights so you are seen in traffic\\". Early type of DRL as used by Volvo and Saab on Nordic markets in the 1970s and 1980s: Bright filaments were mounted in the front parking lamps as \\"perception light\\" DRLs were first mandated in the Nordic countries, where ambient light levels in the winter are generally low even during the day. Sweden was the first country to require widespread DRLs in 1977. At the time, the function was known as varselljus (\\"perception light\\" or \\"notice light\\"). The initial regulations in these countries favored devices incorporating 21 W signal bulbs identical to those used in brake lamps and turn signals, producing yellow or white light of approximately 400 to 600 cd on axis, mounted at the outer left and right edges of the front of the vehicle. Finland adopted a daytime-light requirement in 1972 on rural roads in wintertime, and in 1982 on rural roads in summertime and 1997 on all roads all year long; Norway in 1986, Iceland in 1988, and Denmark in 1990. To increase manufacturer flexibility in complying with the requirement for DRLs, the daytime illumination of low beam headlights was added as an optional implementation. Given the headlamp specifications in use in those countries, such an implementation would produce approximately 450 cd axially. United Kingdom UK regulations briefly required vehicles first used on or after 1 April 1987 to be equipped with a dim-dip device or functionally dedicated daytime running lamps, except those vehicles type-approved to ECE Regulation 48 regarding installation of lighting equipment‚Äîthis exception was made because ECE R48 did not require dim-dip or daytime running lights, and while countries signatory to the ECE Regulations are permitted to maintain their own national regulations as an option to the ECE regulations, they are not permitted to bar vehicles approved under the ECE regulations. The dim-dip system operated the low beam headlamps (called \\"dipped beam\\" in the UK) at between 10% and 20% of normal low beam intensity. The running lamps permitted as an alternative to dim-dip were required to emit at least 200 cd straight ahead, and no more than 800 cd in any direction. In practice, most vehicles were equipped with the dim-dip option rather than the running lamps. The dim- dip lights were not intended for use as daytime running lights. Rather, they operated when the engine was running and the driver switched on the front position (parking) lamps. Dim-dip was intended to provide a nighttime \\"town beam\\" with intensity between that of the parking lamps commonly used at the time by British drivers in city traffic after dark, and low beam headlamps; the former were considered insufficiently intense to provide improved conspicuity in conditions requiring it, while the latter were considered too glaring for safe use in built-up areas. The UK was the only country to require such dim-dip systems, though vehicles so equipped were sold in other Commonwealth countries with left-hand traffic. In 1988, the European Commission successfully prosecuted the UK government in the European Court of Justice, arguing that the UK requirement for dim-dip was illegal under EC directives prohibiting member states from enacting vehicle lighting requirements not contained in pan-European EC directives. As a result, the UK requirement for dim-dip was quashed. Nevertheless, dim-dip systems remain permitted, and while such systems are not presently as common as they once were, dim-dip functionality was fitted on many new cars (such as the Volkswagen Polo) well into the 1990s. =Canada= Reduced-voltage high beam DRL on a US/Canada 2002 Lexus RX300 Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 requires DRLs on all new vehicles made or imported after January 1, 1990. Canada's proposed DRL regulation was essentially similar to regulations in place in Scandinavia, with an axial luminous intensity limit of 1,500 cd, but automakers claimed it was too expensive to add a new front lighting device, and would increase warranty costs (by dint of increased bulb replacements) to run the low beams. After a regulatory battle, the standard was rewritten to permit the use of reduced-voltage high beam headlamps producing up to 7,000 axial candela, as well as permitting any light color from white to amber or selective yellow. These changes to the regulation permitted automakers to implement a less costly DRL, such as by connecting the high beam filaments in series to supply each filament with half its rated voltage, or by burning the front turn signals full-time except when they are actually flashing as turn indicators. =United States= Shortly after Canada mandated DRLs, General Motors, interested in reducing the build variations of cars for the North American market, petitioned the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1990 to permit (but not require) US vehicles to be equipped with DRLs like those in Canada.Federal Register 98-20918 NPRM: Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment NHTSA objected on grounds of the potential for high-intensity DRLs to create problems with glare and turn signal masking, and issued a proposed rule in 1991 that specified a maximum intensity of 2,600 cd. Industry and safety watchdogs reacted to the proposed rule, and eventually the glare objections were set aside and most of the same types of DRLs allowed in Canada were permitted but not required effective with the 1995 model year. General Motors immediately equipped most (and, in following years, all) of its vehicles with DRLs beginning with the Chevrolet Corsica. Saab, Volkswagen, Volvo, Suzuki and Subaru gradually introduced DRLs in the U.S. market beginning in 1995. In recent years, Lexus has installed high-beam or turn signal based DRLs on US models. Some Toyota models come with DRLs as standard or optional equipment, and with a driver-controllable on/off switch. Starting in the 2006 model year, Honda began equipping their U.S. models with DRLs, mostly by reduced-intensity operation of the high beam headlamps. Public reaction to DRLs, generally neutral to positive in Canada, is decidedly mixed in the U.S. Thousands of complaints regarding glare from DRLs were lodged with the DOT shortly after DRLs were permitted on cars, and there was also concern that headlamp-based DRLs reduce the conspicuity of motorcycles, and that DRLs based on front turn signals introduce ambiguity into the turn signal system. In 1997, in response to these complaints and after measuring actual DRL intensity well above the 7,000 cd limit on vehicles in use, DOT proposed changes to the DRL specification that would have capped axial intensity at 1,500 cd, a level equivalent to the European 1,200 cd and identical to the initially proposed Canadian limit. During the open comment period, a volume of public comments were received by NHTSA in support of lowering the intensity or advocating the complete elimination of DRLs from U.S. roads. Automaker sentiment generally ran along consistent lines, with European automakers experienced at complying with European DRL requirements voicing no objection to the proposal, and North American automakers vociferously repeating the same objections they raised in response to Canada's initial 1,500-cd proposal.docket for DRL glare complaintsAborted NHTSA rulemaking to reduce DRL glare, with public complaints The NHTSA proposal for DRL intensity reduction was rescinded in 2004,NHTSA docket for withdrawal of intended rulemaking to reduce DRL glare pending agency review and decision on a petition filed in 2001 by General Motors, seeking to have NHTSA mandate DRLs on all U.S. vehicles.Federal Register E9-15314: Denial of GM Petition to Mandate DRLs The GM petition was denied by NHTSA in 2009, on grounds of severe methodological and analytical flaws in the studies and data provided by GM as evidence for a safety benefit to DRLs. In denying the petition, NHTSA said > (‚Ä¶) the agency remains neutral with respect to a policy regarding the > inclusion of DRLs in vehicles (‚Ä¶) we do not find data that provides a > definitive safety benefit that justifies Federal regulation (‚Ä¶) > manufacturers should continue to make individual decisions regarding DRLs in > their vehicles. Several states on the Eastern seaboard, the Southeast, Gulf Coast and California have laws that require headlights to be switched on when windshield wipers are in use.Headlight Usage DRLs are not considered headlights in most vehicle codes and so DRLs may not meet the letter of these laws in use. =Australia= DRLs are permitted but not required in Australia, though the Australian College of Road Safety, an Australian automotive safety group, advocates for making DRLs mandatory rather than optional.

Huerta helped organize the Delano grape strike in 1965 in California and was the lead negotiator in the workers' contract that was created after the strike. Huerta has received numerous awards for her community service and advocacy for workers', immigrants', and women's rights, including the Eugene V. Debs Foundation Outstanding American Award, the United States Presidential Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She was the first Latina inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, in 1993. Huerta is the originator of the phrase, \\"S√≠, se puede\\". As a role model to many in the Latino community, Huerta is the subject of many corridos (Mexican or Mexican-American ballads) and murals. In California, April 10 is Dolores Huerta Day. Early life Huerta was born on April 10, 1930, in the mining town of Dawson, New Mexico. She is the second child and only daughter of Juan Fern√°ndez and Alicia Ch√°vez. Juan Fern√°ndez was born in Dawson to a Mexican immigrant family, and worked as a coal miner. Later, he joined the migrant labor force, and harvested beets in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. When Huerta was young, she would hear her father tell stories about union organizing. After her parents divorced when she was three years old, she seldom saw her father. He stayed in New Mexico, and served in the state legislature in 1938. Ch√°vez raised Huerta and her two brothers in the central California farm worker community of Stockton, California. Huerta's mother was known for her kindness and compassion towards others and was active in community affairs, numerous civic organizations, and the church. She encouraged the cultural diversity that was a natural part of Huerta's upbringing in Stockton. Alicia Ch√°vez was a businesswoman who owned a restaurant and a 70-room hotel, where she welcomed low-wage workers and farm worker families at affordable prices and sometimes gave them free housing. Huerta was inspired by her mother to advocate for farm workers later on in her life. In an interview Huerta stated that \\"The dominant person in my life is my mother. She was a very intelligent woman and a very gentle woman\\".Loya, Gloria (January 1998). \\"Considering the sources/ fuentes for a Hispanic feminist theology.\\" Theology Today. Retrieved September 23, 2015. This prompted Huerta to think about civil rights. Her mother's generous actions during Dolores's childhood provided the foundation for her own non-violent, strongly spiritual stance. In the same interview she said, \\"When we talk about spiritual forces, I think that Hispanic women are more familiar with spiritual forces. We know what fasting is, and that it is part of the culture. We know what relationships are, and we know what sacrifice is\\". Huerta's community activism began when she was a student at Stockton High School. Huerta was active in numerous school clubs, and was a majorette and dedicated member of the Girl Scouts until the age of 18. She remembered a school teacher accusing her of stealing another student's work and, as a result, giving her an unfair grade, an act she considers to be rooted in racial bias. Having experienced marginalization during childhood because she was Hispanic, Huerta grew up with the belief that society needed to be changed. She attended college at the University of the Pacific's Stockton College (later to become San Joaquin Delta Community College), where she earned a provisional teaching credential. After teaching elementary school, Huerta left her job and began her lifelong crusade to correct economic injustice: Career as an activist Dolores Huerta in 2009 In 1955, Huerta along with Fred Ross co-founded and organized the Stockton Chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO), which fought for economic improvements for Latinx/Mexican/Chicano migrant Farm workers. Due to her dedication and willingness to serve, Ross often delegated huge responsibilities to her. He knew she was capable of delivering the organization's message in Spanish and English and promoted the agenda from door to door field organizing.Frank, M. \\"Dolores found her calling as an organizer while serving in the leadership of Stockton Community Service Organization (CSO)\\", \\"Dolores Huerta coined the term: \\"S√≠, se puede ‚Äî We can do it.\\". \\" File: Dolores Huerta.

In 1960, Huerta co-founded the Agricultural Workers Association, which set up voter registration drives and pressed local governments for barrio improvements.Dolores Huerta Foundation (November 16, 2013) located its headquarters in Bakersfield, California, where it still recruits organizers and volunteers who want to support \\"la causa.\\" \\"Dolores Huerta.\\" Retrieved September 23, 2015. In 1962, she co-founded, with C√©sar Ch√°vez, the National Farm Workers Association, which would later become the United Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee. Huerta was the only woman to ever sit on the board of the UFW, until 2018. In 1966, she negotiated a contract between the UFWOC and Schenley Wine Company, marking the first time that farm workers were able to effectively bargain with an agricultural enterprise. Through her work with the CSO, Huerta met Ch√°vez, its executive director. Chavez thought Huerta was smart, articulate, and self- starting. But Chavez and Huerta quickly realized that they shared a common goal of helping improve the lives and wages of farmworkers, so they co-founded the National Farm Workers Association. In 1962, after the CSO turned down Ch√°vez's request, as their president, to organize farmworkers, Ch√°vez and Huerta resigned from the CSO. She went to work for the National Farm Workers Association, which would later merge with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee to become the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee. \\"Dolores's organizing skills were essential to the growth of this budding organization.\\" The Original UFW house is located in the city of Los Angeles. At the age of only 25, Huerta was a lobbyist in Sacramento for the Stockton Community Service Organization and trained people to do grassroots organizing. The foundation was later changed to an affiliated agricultural workers organization. In an interview, Huerta explained why she wanted to help the farmworkers. She explained, she was able to get an inside look at how the farm workers were living and they were by far the most poverty-stricken workers. She explained the farmworkers were being paid little to nothing, they had no rights, they slept on the floors, their furniture was wooden boxes, did not have clean water, access to bathrooms, would work from sunrise to sundown, and were not given any breaks. Many of these workers would migrate and traveled to where the crops were in season, meaning their children did not have a proper education and would often work in the fields along with their parents. She explained that many women were often sexually assaulted by the landowners but were in fear to speak up because their family needed a job. Huerta explained that many of these landowners would justify themselves by saying \\"we are doing the farmworkers and the public a favor by giving these people a job.\\" she explained that the landowners had received the land and water for free and also expected the labor for free. After Dolores saw the conditions these people were living in, (shantytowns, and living in squalor) she joined the organization. She explained, laws must be passed in order for these people to get treated fairly which is why she worked hard and put constant pressure to get laws passed. With the help of the organization, she helped champion for the rights of workers in agricultural fields to ensure they were well paid and worked in better conditions. In 1965, Huerta directed the UFW's national boycott during the Delano grape strike, taking the plight of the farm workers to the consumers. She led the organization of boycotts advocating for consumer rights. The boycott resulted in the entire California table grape industry signing a three-year collective bargaining agreement with the United Farm Workers in 1970. In addition to organizing, Huerta has been active in lobbying for laws to improve the lives of farm workers. The laws that she supported included the following: * 1960 bill to permit Spanish-speaking people to take the California driver's examination in Spanish * 1962 legislation repealing the Bracero Program * 1963 legislation to extend the federal program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), to California farmworkers * The 1975 California Agricultural Labor Relations Act As an advocate for farmworkers' rights, Huerta has been arrested twenty-two times for participating in non- violent civil disobedience activities and strikes. She remains active in progressive causes, and serves on the boards of People for the American Way, Consumer Federation of California, and Feminist Majority Foundation. On June 5, 1968, Huerta stood beside Robert F. Kennedy on the speaker's platform at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles as he delivered a victory statement to his political supporters shortly after winning the California Democratic presidential primary election. Only moments after the candidate finished his speech, Kennedy and five other people were wounded by gunfire inside the hotel's kitchen pantry. Kennedy died from his gunshot wounds on June 6. In September 1988, in front of the St. Francis Hotel in Union Square, Huerta was severely beaten by San Francisco Police officer Frank Achim during a peaceful and lawful protest of the policies/platform of then-candidate for president George H.W. Bush. The baton-beating caused significant internal injuries to her torso, resulting in several broken ribs and requiring the removal of her spleen in emergency surgery. The beating was caught on videotape and broadcast widely on local television news. Later, Huerta won a large judgment against the SFPD and the City of San Francisco for the attack, the proceeds of which she used for the benefit of farm workers. As a result of this assault and the suit, the SFPD was pressured to change its crowd control policies and its process of officer discipline. Following a lengthy recovery, Huerta took a leave of absence from the union to focus on women's rights. She traversed the country for two years on behalf of the Feminist Majority's Feminization of Power: 50/50 by the year 2000 Campaign encouraging Latinas to run for office. The campaign resulted in a significant increase in the number of women representatives elected at the local, state and federal levels. She also served as National Chair of the 21st Century Party, founded in 1992 on the principles that women make up 52% of the party's candidates and that officers must reflect the ethnic diversity of the nation.  Dolores Huerta Foundation  Huerta is president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, which she founded in 2002. It is a 501(c)(3) \\"community benefit organization that organizes at the grassroots level, engaging and developing natural leaders. DHF creates leadership opportunities for community organizing, leadership development, civic engagement, and policy advocacy in the following priority areas: health & environment, education & youth development, and economic development.\\" The foundation first got started when Huerta received the $100,000 Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship, which she then used to create the DHF. Her youngest daughter, Camila Chavez, is the Executive Director at the foundation and ‚Äúnow leads a staff of over 20 organizing, communications, and administrative staff and interns who conduct programs.‚Äù The primary purpose of the foundation is to weave in movements such as ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs rights, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, labor rights, and civil rights‚Äù into an individual thread. They believe that all of these issues are universal human rights issues and, therefore, through the combination of engagement, programs, and volunteers, they try to raise awareness for such issues and encourage others also to be activists. The DHF has several programs ranging from Civic Engagement to the Youth Program they provide to Education and Equality. In these programs, they provide ‚Äúorganizing training and resources to rural, low-income communities.‚Äù The Civic Engagement program focuses on the voting rights of the people. They have protested, with petitions and signatures, to revise property tax loopholes in Proposition 13. Another more recent part of their campaigns was to encourage voters to vote on June 5 at the CA Primary Elections, and they ‚Äúwere educated on important federal issues such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the White House Budget.‚Äù Projects like this were very successful, where they were able to get 31,858 unduplicated contacts to help in these types of campaigns. They also created a Youth VOTE Campaign, where they were able to reach 1,055 contacts and 809 young voters. There have been several ‚Äòvictories‚Äô along the way for this foundation. For example, the registration of more than 1,000 young immigrant voters in Kern and Tulare counties. They also have ‚Äúsecured millions of dollars for local infrastructures such as new sewer connections, street lights, sidewalks, and gutters in Lamont and Weedpatch from 2007-2015.‚Äù Education is one of the biggest priorities for the organization and had a historic win in 2017 where the Kern High School District ‚Äúagreed to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of Latino and Black students for disproportionately suspending students of color due to implicit bias.‚Äù The district now has positive disciple practices and provides training to all staff members. The DHF has been in the news several times since its beginning. San Francisco Weekly did a feature story on the foundation called, ‚ÄúSF School named for Dolores Huerta, raises funds to do even more.‚Äù It goes on to detail that parents created a GoFundMe page to honor Huerta with a mural. The Elementary school principal, Luis Rodriguez, goes on to say, ‚Äúour school is where we want to teach students the power of voice, the power of presence, the power of being, the power of standing up for dignity and fighting for equity, embodying the life lessons and activism of someone like Dolores Huerta.‚Äù  Awards and honors  Dolores Huerta currently has about 15 honorary doctorates.

La Academia Dolores Huerta. The school specializes in bilingual studies, Latin dance and folk music. Women's rights Dolores Huerta speaking at a campaign rally with former President Bill Clinton at Central High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Huerta championed women's rights in feminist campaigns during her time off from union work. She also fought for ethnic diversity in her campaigns. Huerta was an honorary co-chair of the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Dolores, a new documentary about Huerta, talks a lot about her feminist approach to activism. She defines a feminist person as someone \\"who supports a woman's reproductive rights who supports a woman's right to an abortion, who supports LGBT rights, who supports workers and labor unions, somebody who cares about the environment, who cares about civil rights and equality and equity in terms of our economic system.\\" Huerta goes on, in the documentary, to explain how she understands why many people think \\"feminism is for white women\\" and that is because middle-class women initially organized it, however, her stances to show that women of color can be at the front of civil rights, labor, and feminist movements. When looking to the future of activism, Huerta believes that education is the way to go, stating: \\"We've got to include, from pre-K, the contributions of people of color in our schools today.\\" She says this is the only way to erase the ignorance we have in the world right now. Dolores Huerta and Gloria Steinem championed intersectionality in activism. In the 60's, when Huerta traveled to New York City for the Boycott of California Table Grapes, she was focused on bringing women to the fight. Said Huerta: ‚ÄúMy mind was focused on getting those women at those conventions to support the farmworkers,\\". At the convention, Gloria Steinem voiced her support for Huerta's cause, which prompted Huerta to lend her support for the feminist movement. Huerta believes herself to be a ‚Äúborn again feminist‚Äù. By consciously incorporating feminism into her fight for workers‚Äô rights, Huerta had more of an impact on how female workers were treated. Additionally, Steinem expended the feminist movement to include issues surrounding race and feminism was no longer a movement just for white women. In 2014, Dolores Huerta organized people in Colorado to vote against Amendment 67, which would limit a woman's access to birth control, family planning services, and abortions. Amendment 67 extended the definition of ‚Äúperson‚Äù and ‚Äúchild‚Äù to fertilized egg. Many call this amendment a ‚Äútrigger law‚Äù meaning if Roe v. Wade were ever overturned the law would be ‚Äútriggered‚Äù, automatically banning all abortions, even in the case of rape, incest, or the save the life or health of the woman. Amendment 67 would not only restrict all access to birth control and abortions, but it would also subject any woman whose pregnancy did not result in a live birth, including women who have a miscarriage, to a criminal investigation. Huerta spent three decades advocating for safer working conditions with the UFW. A key part of her platform was reducing harmful pesticides. As her movement grew more feminist in nature, this became more important as pesticides cause pregnancy complications such as: decreased fertilitity, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and developmental abnormalities. Personal life Huerta married Ralph Head in college. During their marriage, they had two daughters, Celeste and Lori. After divorcing Head, she married Ventura Huerta, with whom she bore five children. Their son Emilio Jesus Huerta entered politics and ran for Congress. Her second marriage ended in divorce as well, in part because of the significant amount of time that she spent away from the family while campaigning and organizing. Later, Huerta had a romantic relationship with Richard Chavez, the brother of C√©sar Ch√°vez. Huerta and Ch√°vez never married, but the couple had four children during their relationship. Richard Ch√°vez died on July 27, 2011. Archival collection The Dolores Huerta Papers are a part of the United Farm Workers Collections at the Walter P. Reuther Library.

It is normally eaten during breakfast, but is also eaten occasionally during lunch or as a late night snack and popular hangover food for local Trinidadians. Doubles are made with two baras (flat fried dough) and filled with curry channa (curried chickpeas) and various chutneys. Doubles was first created in Fairfield, Princes Town by Emamool Deen (a.k.a. Mamudeen) and his wife Raheman Rasulan Deen in 1936.  Origins  It has been speculated that the dish was inspired by a northern Indian dish called chole bhature (or sometimes channa bhatura). Chole bhature is made by combining channa masala with spicy chickpeas and bhature (poori) , which is a fried bread made with maida flour, a common flour in Indian baking. The name doubles arose when Mamudeen used to sell the bara (flat fried dough) used to make doubles, alongside the channa (chickpeas). It wasn't until the people buying these two items from Mamudeen began requesting to double the bara in their orders which is why the name doubles stuck.  Preparation  Doubles can be served spicy, sweet, or savory depending on the preference of the individual preparing or buying the double. The sandwich consisting of the two baras gets its spicy kick from the spicy pepper sauce added to it. It is also paired with mango, chandon beni (also known as culantro), coconut, and tamarind.  Cultural significance  Given the diversity of Trinidad, doubles is credited with its ability to \\"define and maintain symbolic boundaries of identification\\", and is considered an authentic standard of Trinidadian cuisine. Doubles is culturally significant outside of Trinidad as it is a comfort food for displaced Trinidadians in major cities across the globe who have historically been marginalized as immigrants. The consumption of doubles by immigrants from Trinidad has been credited with developing a \\"deep psychological imprinting\\" and as such is considered culturally significant for how it encapsulated Trinidadian identity into such a simple and unique snack.

She is best known for her work organizing Mexican workers in Texas during the 1930s, particularly for leading the 1938 San Antonio pecan shellers strike.  Early life  Tenayuca grew up in a family of eleven, but began living with her grandparents at an early age in order to ease the burden on her family. She was born into a Mexican Comanche family, and their lineage in South Texas predated both Mexican independence and the Mexico-U.S. War. The Tenayuca family were hit hard by the Depression, and all around her, Emma began to see the suffering of low class workers.  Political involvement  She became interested in activism and was a labor activist before graduating from Brackenridge High School in San Antonio. Tenayuca‚Äôs first arrest came at the age of 16, in 1933, when she joined a picket line of workers in strike against the Finck Cigar Company. After high school, Tenayuca obtained a position as an elevator operator, but she continued working for human rights.  Labor union activism  She founded two international ladies' garment workers unions, and was involved in both the Worker‚Äôs Alliance of America and Woman‚Äôs League for Peace and Freedom. She organized a protest over the beating of Mexican migrants by United States Border Patrol agents. In her early adulthood she was arrested for a second and third time: once on a charge of ‚Äúdisturbing the peace‚Äù during a nonviolent protest, and again for her leadership role in a labor strike in 1938. Organizing large scale strikes against the injustices in the labor sphere was also one of Tenayuca‚Äôs vocations. Tenayuca was instrumental in one of the most famous conflicts of Texas labor history-the 1938 San Antonio pecan shellers strike at the Southern Pecan Shelling Company. During the strike, thousands of workers at over 130 plants protested a wage reduction of one cent per pound of shelled pecans. Mexicana and Chicana workers who picketed were gassed, arrested, and jailed. The strike ended after thirty-seven days when the city's pecan operators agreed to arbitration. In October that year, the National Labor Relations Act raised wages to twenty- five cents an hour. Another source of Tenayuca's first-hand knowledge of the struggles of working people came from visits as a young child to the Plaza del Zacate, which means a grass plaza, a public square where socialists and anarchists would come to speak and work with families with grievances. Because it advocated her passion for minority rights, Tenayuca joined the Communist Party in 1936. Then, less than a year later, she was scheduled to speak at a small Communist Party meeting at the Municipal Auditorium permitted by San Antonio Mayor Maury Maverick. A crowd of 5,000 attacked the auditorium with bricks and rocks, \\"huntin' Communists.\\" Police helped Tenayuca escape from the mob, but she was blacklisted and forced to move out of San Antonio.  Education and personal life  In 1938 she married organizer Homer Bartchy who used the alias \\"Homer Brooks.\\" Eventually, Tenayuca went on to pursue a college degree. She divorced Brooks in 1941 and left her hometown in order to attend San Francisco State College where she majored in Education. She later earned a master‚Äôs in education from Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio. From there she went on to teach in Harlandale School District until her retirement in 1982. Shortly after retirement Emma Tenayuca developed Alzheimer's disease and died on July 23, 1999. Photograph shows the couple, Emma and Homer Brooks standing together in the Tenayuca family home.  Legacy  Tenayuca continued to inspire activists until and beyond her death. The admiration felt for her can be seen in That‚Äôs Not Fair! Emma Tenayuca‚Äôs Struggle for Justice, a bilingual children‚Äôs book that tells the story of her contributions to the pecan sheller strike, as well as in the play-dramas written to honor her dedication and contributions.

On August 14, 2020, on MSNBC's \\"Morning Joe\\" Deutsch said that one in three American are racist for trusting President Trump. While referencing a NPR-PBS-Marist Poll he said, \\"how do one in three Americans still believe this man about corona or anything?\\" \\"The answer is only one thing: One in three Americans are racists,\\" Deutsch said. \\"One in three Americans are terrified that this country, by the year 2040, is not going to be majority white. That the black man or brown man or the yellow man or woman are going to come and take their jobs and take away their suburbs and scare them\\". Deutsch, later in the show, apologized for using the ethnic slur, \\"yellow man\\", saying \\"[I] was just trying to make a point and I apologize if I offended anybody.

There are no free state-provided health services, but private health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in Switzerland (within three months of taking up residence or being born in the country). Health insurance covers the costs of medical treatment and hospitalisation of the insured. However, the insured person pays part of the cost of treatment. This is done (a) by means of an annual deductible (called the franchise), which ranges from CHF 300 (PPP-adjusted US$ 184) to a maximum of CHF 2,500 (PPP- adjusted $1,534) for an adult as chosen by the insured person (premiums are adjusted accordingly) and (b) by a charge of 10% of the costs over and above the excess up to a stop-loss amount of CHF 700 (PPP-adjusted $429). Compulsory coverage and costs Swiss are required to purchase basic health insurance, which covers a range of treatments detailed in the Swiss Federal Law on Health Insurance (; ; ). It is therefore the same throughout the country and avoids double standards in healthcare. Insurers are required to offer this basic insurance to everyone, regardless of age or medical condition. They are not allowed to make a profit off this basic insurance, but can on supplemental plans. The insured person pays the insurance premium for the basic plan up to 8% of their personal income. If a premium is higher than this, the government gives the insured person a cash subsidy to pay for any additional premium. The universal compulsory coverage provides for treatment in case of illness or accident (unless another accident insurance provides the cover) and pregnancy. Health insurance covers the costs of medical treatment and hospitalization of the insured. However, the insured person pays part of the cost of treatment. This is done by these ways: *by means of an annual excess (or deductible, called the franchise), which ranges from CHF 300 (PPP- adjusted US$ 184) to a maximum of CHF 2,500 (PPP-adjusted $1,534) for an adult as chosen by the insured person (premiums are adjusted accordingly); *by a charge of 10% of the costs over and above the excess. This is known as the retention, and is up to a maximum of 700CHF (PPP-adjusted $429) per year. In case of pregnancy, there is no charge. For hospitalisation, one pays a contribution to room and service costs. Insurance premiums vary from insurance company to company (health insurance funds; ; ; ), the excess level chosen (franchise), the place of residence of the insured person and the degree of supplementary benefit coverage chosen (complementary medicine, routine dental care, half-private or private ward hospitalisation, etc.). In 2014, the average monthly compulsory basic health insurance premiums (with accident insurance) in Switzerland are the following: * CHF 396.12 (PPP-adjusted US$ 243) for an adult (age 26+) * CHF 363.55 (PPP-adjusted $223) for a young adult (age 19‚Äì25) * CHF 91.52 (PPP-adjusted $56.14) for a child (age 0‚Äì18) International civil servants, members of embassies, and their family members are exempted from compulsory health insurance. Requests for exemptions are handled by the respective cantonal authority and have to be addressed to them directly. Private coverage The compulsory insurance can be supplemented by private \\"complementary\\" insurance policies that allow for coverage of some of the treatment categories not covered by the basic insurance or to improve the standard of room and service in case of hospitalisation. This can include complementary medicine, routine dental treatments, half-private or private ward hospitalisation, and others, which are not covered by the compulsory insurance. As far as the compulsory health insurance is concerned, the insurance companies cannot set any conditions relating to age, sex or state of health for coverage. Although the level of premium can vary from one company to another, they must be identical within the same company for all insured persons of the same age group and region, regardless of sex or state of health. This does not apply to complementary insurance, where premiums are risk-based. Organization Children's hospital in Basel, Switzerland. The Swiss healthcare system is a combination of public, subsidised private and totally private systems: * public: e. g. the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG) with 2,350 beds, 8,300 staff and 50,000 patients per year; * subsidised private: the home care services to which one may have recourse in case of a difficult pregnancy, after childbirth, illness, accident, handicap or old age; * totally private: doctors in private practice and in private clinics. The insured person has full freedom of choice among the recognised healthcare providers competent to treat their condition (in his region) on the understanding that the costs are covered by the insurance up to the level of the official tariff. There is freedom of choice when selecting an insurance company (provided it is an officially registered caisse-maladie or a private insurance company authorised by the federal law) to which one pays a premium, usually on a monthly basis. The list of officially approved insurance companies can be obtained from the cantonal authority. =Electronic health records= Before the discussions about a nation-wide implementation, electronic health records were widely used in both private and public healthcare organizations. In 2007, the Swiss Federal Government approved a national strategy for adoption of e-health. A central element of this strategy is a nationwide electronic health record. Following the federal tradition of Switzerland, it is planned that the infrastructure will be implemented in a decentralized way, i.e. using an access and control mechanism for federating existing records. In order to govern legal and financial aspects of the future nationwide EHR implementation, a bill was passed by the Swiss Federal Government in 2013, but left open questions regarding mandatory application. The Federal Act on the Electronic Patient Record came into force on 15 April 2017, but the records will not be universally available until 2020. It will be extended to birth centres and nursing homes in 2022. Both patients and clinicians can store and access health data in the records.

Statistics Healthcare costs in Switzerland are 11.4% of GDP (2010), comparable to Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but significantly less than in the USA (17.6%). By 2015 the cost had risen to 11.7% of GDP -the second highest in Europe. Benefits paid out as a percentage of premiums were 90.4% in 2011. Total gross benefits per person and per year in 2011 were CHF 3,171 (PPP-adjusted US$1,945), of which CHF 455 (PPP-adjusted $279) are cost sharing. According to the OECD Switzerland has the highest density of nurses among 27 measured countries, namely 17.4 nurses per thousand people in 2013.

Blackman has recorded several jazz albums as solo act and has performed with Pharoah Sanders, Sonny Simmons, Ron Carter, Sam Rivers, Cassandra Wilson, Angela Bofill, Buckethead, Bill Laswell, Lenny Kravitz, Joe Henderson and Joss Stone. She was influenced early in her career by seeing Tony Williams perform. In 1997 she recorded the instructional video Multiplicity. \\"To me, jazz is the highest form of music that you can play because of the creative requirements\\", says Blackman. Blackman is married to rock guitarist Carlos Santana.  Biography  = Early musical training and influences = Born November 18, 1959 in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Blackman comes from a musical family, both her mother and grandmother were classical musicians and her uncle a vibist. \\"My mom, when she was younger, played violin in classical orchestras, and her mom, incidentally, was a classical musician. My mom used to take me to see classical concerts\\", says Blackman. \\"My dad was into jazz ‚Äì Miles Davis, Ahmad Jamal, people like that.\\" Blackman's first introduction to the drums happened when she was seven years old in her hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio and attending a pool party at a friend's house, she went to use the bathroom and saw a drum set and just hopped onto the set. \\"Just looking at them struck something in my core, and it was completely right from the second I saw them\\", says Blackman. \\"And then, when I hit them, it was like, wow, that's me. That's completely natural for me. It's like breathing for me. It didn't feel awkward at all.\\" After her introduction to drums at her friend's house, Blackman began playing in the school band and persuaded her parents to get her toy drums when she was seven. \\"Of course those would be broken up in a matter of days\\", Blackman says. \\"The only thing I heard at home was, 'we don't know if you can play drums because one, they're noisy, and two, they're very expensive\\". Some people ask why she didn't study violin or flute like other girls. \\"I learned very early on ‚Äì when I was 13 ‚Äì that when I concentrate on those attitudes, I don't make progress for myself\\", says Blackman. \\"If they're not paying my mortgage, I don't care what they think\\".  Influences  When Blackman was 11, she moved to Bristol, Connecticut and studied at the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Connecticut. Blackman began to have an interest in jazz at age 13 after listening to Max Roach and got her first professional drum set at 14. \\"Jazz was the thing that was most intriguing because of the challenge that was involved\\", says Blackman. \\"When I was shown that the drummers on these records were playing independently with all four limbs, I was like: 'Really?! Is that what they're doing? Is that what Max Roach is doing on that record? Oh! Okay!'\\" Drummer Tony Williams was an early influence.Code Red. Liner Notes. 1992. \\"The first drummer I ever saw, where I got to feel the impact up close, was Tony Williams\\", Blackman said. \\"When I was 16, Tony came to my local drum store with a bassist and did a [drum] clinic that left a powerful impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should have a lot of impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band‚Äîthe drums should speak just as freely as anybody.\\" Blackman says that the way that Williams used all four limbs to attack the drums strongly influenced her. \\"I just love and loved everything about Tony\\", says Blackman. \\"To me, not only was he a master technician, a master drummer, the innovator of the age, but also, he was a sound innovator. He had so many things that elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music.\\" But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path. \\"On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that ‚Äì Okay, I might not be where I want to be, but I'm on the right track\\", says Blackman. \\"On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way\\". Blackman moved to Boston to study at the Berklee College of Music with Alan Dawson, one of Tony Williams' teachers. \\"Alan's method was incredible in terms of getting your independence together, getting your hands together\\". says Blackman.  Arrival in New York  Cindy Blackman plays at the Iridium on December 9, 2007. While she was at Berklee a friend recommended her for a gig with The Drifters so Blackman left college after three semesters and moved to New York City in 1982. Blackman worked as a New York street performer but also got a chance to watch and learn. \\"I looked for Art Blakey, I looked for Elvin [Jones], I looked for Philly Joe Jones, for Roy Haynes, for Tony Williams. I saw so many great drummers, like Ed Blackwell and Billy Higgins, Louis Hayes. I saw Al Foster play quite a bit, Billy Hart, Jack DeJohnette. All these people, they're in New York so I got a chance to watch them do their thing\\". While in New York, Art Blakey became a significant influence. \\"He really was like a father to me. I learned a lot just watching him. I asked him a lot of questions about the drums and music ‚Äì and he answered all of them. He was fantastic\\", said Blackman. Blackman initially encountered resistance to a woman playing drums in the jazz world. \\"I'm a black woman, so I've encountered racial prejudice, and I've encountered gender prejudice. I've also encountered prejudice against my afro when I wore that out. But I've also encountered prejudice against my musical opinions. What I've learned to do is completely ignore that\\". = First compositions and recording contracts = In 1984, Blackman was showcased on Ted Curson's \\"Jazz Stars of the Future\\" on WKCR-FM in New York. In 1987, Blackman's first compositions appeared on Wallace Roney's Verses album. When an executive at Muse Records heard Blackman's recordings, he offered her a recording contract to lead her own project. In 1988 Blackman released Arcane, her debut as a bandleader. Her band included Wallace Roney on trumpet, Kenny Garrett on alto saxophone, Joe Henderson on tenor saxophone, Buster Williams and Clarence Seay on bass, and Larry Willis on piano.  Work with Lenny Kravitz  Blackman performs with Kravitz in concert in Chile on March 9, 2005. In 1993, Blackman had an opportunity to work with Lenny Kravitz. From New York, Blackman talked over the phone with Kravitz in Los Angeles, and played drums for him as he listened. Kravitz immediately asked Blackman to fly out to LA. \\"Lenny asked me can you play something for me over the phone\\", Blackman says. \\"So I put the phone down and I started playing something like, BOOSH-bat-bat, BOOSH-BOOSH- BOOSH-bat, and I went back to the phone and I said, 'Can you hear that?' He said, 'Yeah. Can you fly out to L.A. right now?'\\" \\"I flew out the next morning. While I'm downstairs waiting for the instruments to come from the studio, these people started coming in. First 12, and then like 30 more. I was like, 'whoa, this is an audition'. I ended up playing and instead of staying for one or two days, I stayed for two weeks and did the first video that I did with him, \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\". Apart from 2004, I played with him ever since.\\" Blackman had previously only played jazz shows and was unprepared to play for an entire arena. \\"The first time I played in a really large concert with Lenny was at an outdoor festival called Pinkpop. We played for like 70,000 people. It was in the summer so most people had just t-shirts or tanks, a lot of guys had their shirts off, so you just see skin and hands and they're doing this wave thing. I almost lost it, my equilibrium was teetering. I wasn't used to seeing that many people; I was disoriented; I just had to stop looking and start focusing.\\" Blackman's work for Kravitz is primarily as a touring drummer, to support Kravitz in live concerts. Kravitz usually plays his own drums when recording his albums. The only Kravitz song that Blackman recorded in the studio is \\"Straight Cold Player\\" from the album 5. Blackman says that playing with Kravitz and playing jazz are different. \\"My job with Lenny is a different thing. My job is to play a beat for hours, and make it feel good, and add some exciting fills and exciting colors, when it fits tastefully\\", Blackman says. \\"My job in my band or in a creative situation is a totally different thing. We may start with a groove that feels great, I may play that for hours too, but I'm going to explore and expand and change that, play around with the rhythm and interject with the soloists.\\" \\"I like dance music and I like making the music feel good\\", says Blackman. \\"To drive an audience of 100,000 into complete oblivion by playing a groove so strong ... I love doing that. I love the chance to show versatility.\\" In an article published May 1, 2004, NPR reported that Blackman had left Kravitz's group to focus on her own music. \\"I love danceable music, and I love big fat beats and I really dig rock 'n' roll\\", says Blackman. \\"But jazz is my heart, it's my love, and I've never left jazz in mind or spirit\\". In 2014, Blackman returned to touring with Lenny Kravitz in support of his tenth studio album, Strut.  Return to jazz  Blackman performing in Federation Square, Melbourne, May 2008 In 1994 Blackman made her first recording with a working group and called the album Telepathy because of the tight communication in the band. \\"I wanted to do a quartet record because of the amount of space you get with fewer players\\", she said in Telepathy's liner notes. \\"It's intimate, but more dimensional than a piano trio. I'm really into this sound, and it was nice to play with a group that was a group. You can't help but have a better feel when the musicians know each other, are headed in the same direction, and have the same goals. You can make most everything work. You get chances to play a lot of colors, and really stretch your ideas.\\"Telepathy. Liner Notes. 1994. In 2005 Blackman released Music for the New Millennium on her Sacred Sounds Label. \\"It's rooted in tradition, but it's not traditional music. It's explorative, very creative, very expressive, and we really try to expand any ideas we have that everything is played over the forms, but we like to stretch it, and really see the colors and make the music grow and move\\", says Blackman. \\"We experiment ‚Äì but it's never free. Everything is written out. I have charts for all the songs. We expand on what's there, and stretch harmonics and note choices\\". Blackman continues to make her home in Brooklyn in New York City. \\"It's always such an amazing place, with every level of musical accomplishment, you can see complete beginners and you can see innovators. That's why I live in New York. Not only is it tough, but all the greatest people have come through New York\\", says Blackman. Blackman prefers to play jazz in small, intimate clubs. \\"It's an acoustic situation. You are close-knit and you are creating one hundred percent of the time ‚Äì so to me it just doesn't really get any better that!\\" Blackman also travels extensively conducting drum clinics. In September 2007, she made a tour of South America, teaching clinics in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, and on November 30, 2007, Blackman and her quartet performed at Art After 5 at the Philadelphia Art Museum. In 2010 she released a first tribute album to her mentor and dominant inspiration Tony Williams. Another Lifetime featured Mike Stern on guitar and organist Doug Carn following the line-up of the original Tony Williams Lifetime. As guest musicians appear Joe Lovano, Patrice Rushen and Vernon Reid. Reid is the lead guitarist on the second Williams tribute album Spectrum Road (2012), a collaboration between Blackman, Reid, John Medeski on organ and former bassist of Lifetime and Cream Jack Bruce. Bruce also sings on three tracks of the album and Blackman lend her voice to \\"Where\\", originally written by (then Lifetime guitarist) John McLaughlin and sung by Williams (Emergency!, 1969), which already appeared on Another Lifetime in an instrumental version. She appeared at the 2011 Montreux festival, Switzerland, playing drums for husband Carlos's one off reunion with John McLaughlin, after which she helped mix the sound for the video.  Musical goals and personal life  Cindy Blackman performs at Sesc Pomp√©ia on August 1, 2007. Blackman says her goal is to become a musical virtuoso. \\"I want to become a virtuoso\\", says Blackman. \\"To me, virtuosity is the ability to say anything on your instrument you want to at any given moment.\\" Blackman describes her music as \\"completely creative\\". \\"I want to push the envelope. I want to really expound on some concepts that, to me, are the highest in the improvisation of music\\", says Blackman. Blackman loves jazz and wants to delve into its intricacies. \\"Oh my gosh, it's the best thing in the world\\", says Blackman. \\"I feel so blessed, and I'm so thankful to be able to play music. It's an honor, and it's a blessing\\". On July 9, 2010, Carlos Santana proposed to Blackman on stage during a concert at Tinley Park, Illinois. Blackman is Santana's touring drummer; he proposed immediately after her drum solo. They were married on Maui, Hawaii on December 19, 2010. = Spirituality of music = Blackman attended a Baptist church during her teenage years, but became a follower of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith at the age of 18; she also started studying Kabbalah in the 2000s. Blackman cultivates spirituality in her musicianship. \\"I believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of prayer, whether you're conscious of it or not, because you have a focused intent\\", says Blackman. \\"You transcend, because you're crossing barriers that a lot of people and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it. When you can learn to move those energies, even if they're sad, into something that is of benefit, like focusing on bringing light to people who are listening, or just to the universe in general, then you can do something good with it. I don't keep that in mind 100 per cent of the time ‚Äì I'm human ‚Äì but I try to.\\" = Role as female musician = Blackman is a rarity as a female jazz percussionist. \\"In the past, there were a lot of stigmas attached to women playing certain instruments\\", Blackman says. \\"I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing about that at all. I'm going to do what I'm going to do musically anyway.\\" However Blackman draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a classical pianist and does not let stereotypes deter her. \\"God forbid I should be limited to only play my drums in my basement; but if that's all I had, that's what I would do\\", says Blackman. \\"Any woman, or anyone facing race prejudice, weight prejudice, hair prejudice ... if you let somebody stop you because of their opinions, then the only thing you're doing is hurting yourself. I don't want to give somebody that power over me.\\" Blackman is adamant that musicality has nothing to do with gender. \\"The gender question is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with gender\\", Blackman says. \\"I'm there because I love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green.\\" \\"There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion\\", says Blackman. \\"But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In terms of my goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't.\\"  Discography  *Trio + Two with Santi Debriano, David Fiuczynski plus Greg Osby and Jerry Gonzalez (Free Lance, 1991) *Arcane with Wallace Roney, Joe Henderson, Kenny Garrett, Larry Willis, Buster Williams, Clarence Seay (Muse, 1987) *Code Red with Steve Coleman, Wallace Roney, Kenny Barron, Lonnie Plaxico (Muse, 1990 [1992]) *Telepathy with Antoine Roney, Jacky Terrasson, Clarence Seay (Muse, 1992 [1994]) *The Oracle with Gary Bartz, Kenny Barron, Ron Carter (Muse, 1996) *Black Night ‚Äì Deep Purple Tribute According to New York with TM Stevens, Stevie Salas, Corey Glover, Richie Kotzen (Revolver, 1997) *In the Now with Ravi Coltrane, Jacky Terrasson, Ron Carter (HighNote, 1998) *Works on Canvas with J.

He is best known for his work on the Druuna erotic science fiction series. Early career Paolo Eleuteri Serpieri was born February 29, 1944 in Venice. He moved to Rome in his youth. He studied architecture and painting at Rome's Fine Arts Academy in Rome under Renato Guttuso, and began his career as a painter in 1966, but in 1975 he shifted his focus to comics. He produced work for the Italian comics magazine Lanciostory. A big fan of the American Old West, Serpieri co-created L'Histoire du Far-West (The Story of the West), a Western series about the history of the Old West, with writer Raffaele Ambrosio, which was published in the magazines Lanciostory and Skorpio. Some of the titles were L'Indiana Bianca (The White Indian) and L'Uomo di Medicina (Medicine Man). Beginning in 1980 Serpieri worked on collections like D√©couvrir la Bible, as well as short stories for magazines such as L'Eternauta, Il Fumetto and Orient Express. Druuna In 1985, he published Morbus Gravis, the first work of the Druuna saga. The series is noteworthy for featuring realistic and explicit content including graphic violence and sex. These books have been very successful, selling more than a million copies in twelve languages. The English language translations are published by Heavy Metal. Due to the interest in this series, Serpieri has also published numerous sketchbooks, such as Obsession, Druuna X, Druuna X 2, Croquis, Serpieri Sketchbook, Serpieri Sketchbook 2 and The Sweet Smell of Woman. Serpieri's highly detailed portrayals of well-endowed heroines have earned him the distinction of \\"Master of the Ass\\". Serpieri is also credited with design work on the 3-D video game Druuna: Morbus Gravis, based on his heroine.

It is located on the Union Pacific Railroad south of downtown Fremont, at an elevation of 7 feet (2 m). Formerly used as a hunting village, it has been a ghost town since 1979 and is slowly sinking into the marshlands. It is now part of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge and is illegal to visit. http://sfbws.com/drawbridge History Abandoned buildings in Drawbridge in 2012 Drawbridge was created by the narrow-gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad on Station Island in 1876 and consisted of one small cabin for the operator of the railroad's two drawbridges crossing Mud Slough and Coyote Creek to connect Newark with Alviso and San Jose. At one time 10 passenger trains stopped there per day, five going north and five going south. The drawbridges were removed long ago. The only path leading into Drawbridge is the Union Pacific Railroad track. In the 1880s, on weekends nearly 1,000 visitors flocked to the town. By the 1920s, although the town had no roads, it did have 90 buildings, and was divided into two neighborhoods: the predominantly Roman Catholic South Drawbridge, and the predominantly Protestant North Drawbridge. After the drawbridges were removed and most of the residents had left, the San Jose Mercury News for years incorrectly reported that the town was a ghost town and that the residents left valuables behind. As a result, the people still living there had their homes vandalized.San Jose Underbelly, \\"Drawbridge Lowdown\\", accessed October 12, 2007 The town's last resident is said to have left in 1979, and Drawbridge is considered to be the San Francisco Bay Area's only ghost town. (Though some would argue that Wingo in Sonoma County is a ghost town as well.) Drawbridge is now part of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge and is no longer open to the public due to restoration efforts, though it can still briefly be viewed from Altamont Corridor Express, Capitol Corridor, and Coast Starlight trains.

Known for the \\"penetrating richness\\" of his sound, Harrell performed internationally as a recitalist, chamber musician, and soloist with major orchestras over a career spanning nearly six decades. He was the winner of the inaugural Avery Fisher Prize and two Grammy Awards, among other accolades, and taught at the University of Cincinnati ‚Äì College-Conservatory of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Cleveland Institute of Music, Juilliard School, USC Thornton School of Music, and the Shepherd School of Music. Biography =Early life= Harrell was born on January 30, 1944, to musician parents in Manhattan, New York City: his father was the baritone Mack Harrell, from Texas, and his mother, Marjorie McAlister Fulton, was a violinist, originally from Oklahoma. At the age of nine, he began cello studies. When he was 12, his family moved to Dallas, Texas, where he studied with Lev Aronson while his father taught at Southern Methodist University. Summers were often spent in Colorado, where his father was one of the founders and then the second director of the Aspen Music Festival and School. After attending Denton High School, Harrell studied at the Juilliard School in New York with Leonard Rose and then at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia with Orlando Cole. In 1961, when he was 17, he made his debut at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra as part of a Young People's Concert. In 1960, when Harrell was 15, his father died of cancer. In November 1962, when he was 18, his mother died from injuries sustained from a two-vehicle crash while traveling from Denton to Fort Worth with pianist Jean Mainous to perform a recital; she was violinist in residence (faculty) at the University of North Texas College of Music.Mrs. Marjorie Harrell, Violinist, Teacher, Dies, Dallas Morning News, November 4, 1962, Sec 1, pg. 16 Just before his mother died, in April 1962, Harrell had withdrawn from Denton High School in his junior year to advance to the semifinals of the Second International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.Dentonite in Music Finals, Denton Record-Chronicle, April 9, 1962, pg. 1 After losing his mother, as Harrell put it, \\"I moved around to different family friends' houses with my one suitcase and cello until [after] I was 18, when I joined the Cleveland Orchestra. In part, I got that job because [its conductor] George Szell knew my father through their collaboration at the Metropolitan Opera.\\" Harrell was the principal cellist of the Cleveland Orchestra from 1964 to 1971. =Professional career= Harrell made his recital debut in New York in 1971, and a year later played at a Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center concert. In a review of that concert, Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times declared that \\"it would be hard to overpraise the beautiful playing\\" of Harrell, adding \\"this young man has everything\\". For the rest of his life, he continued to perform internationally as a recitalist, chamber musician, and soloist with orchestras. Also in 1971, he began his teaching career at the University of Cincinnati ‚Äì College- Conservatory of Music. He went on to teach at the Royal Academy of Music in London, the Aspen Music Festival, the Cleveland Institute of Music, and the Juilliard School. He served as the Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute from 1988 to 1992. From 1986 to 1993, he held the post of \\"Gregor Piatigorsky Endowed Chair in Violoncello\\" at the USC Thornton School of Music in Los Angeles; he was only the second person to hold the title, following Piatigorsky himself. He was on the faculty of the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University from 2002 to 2009. Harrell previously played a 1720 Montagnana cello he bought with the proceeds of his parents' estate and also a 1673 Antonio Stradivarius cello that belonged to the late British cellist Jacqueline du Pr√©. His last instrument was a 2008 cello by Christopher Dungey. From 1985 to 1993 he held the International Chair for Cello Studies at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London and in 1993 he became Principal of the RAM, a post he held until 1995. On April 7, 1994, he appeared at the Vatican with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Gilbert Levine in the Papal Concert to Commemorate the Shoah. The audience for this historic event, which was the Holy See's first official commemoration of the Holocaust, included Pope John Paul II and the Chief Rabbi of Rome. In 2001, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra established the Lynn Harrell Concerto Competition in his honor. The competition is open to string players and pianists, ages 8 to 18, from Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. = Death = Harrell died at his home in Santa Monica, California, on April 27, 2020, at the age of 76. According to his wife Helen Nightengale, he died suddenly and probably from cardiac arrest. Personal life In 2002, Harrell married violinist Helen Nightengale, a former student; the couple had two children, Hanna and Noah. Harrell and Nightengale also founded HEARTbeats, which \\"strives to help children in need harness the power of music to better cope with, and recover from, the extreme challenges of poverty and conflict.\\" He had twin children from his first marriage to the journalist and writer Linda Blandford‚ÄîKate, an actress and yoga teacher, and Eben, a journalist, both of whom live and work in London. Harrell seldom trusted his instruments to airline baggage handlers and in 2012 he achieved a certain amount of notoriety when Delta Air Lines kicked him out of its frequent-flier program for registering and traveling with his cello, which had been enrolled as ‚ÄúMr. Cello Harrell.‚Äù Awards * Piatigorsky Award * Ford Foundation Concert Artists' Award * The inaugural Avery Fisher Prize (jointly with Murray Perahia) * Grammy Awards for Best Chamber Music Performance: ** Vladimir Ashkenazy, Lynn Harrell & Itzhak Perlman for Beethoven: The Complete Piano Trios (1988) ** Vladimir Ashkenazy, Lynn Harrell & Itzhak Perlman for Tchaikovsky: Piano Trio in A minor (1982) References External links *Conversation with Lynn Harrell *There's always room for cello.

Nakai played brass instruments in high school and college, and auditioned for the Armed Forces School of Music after a two-year period in the United States Navy. He began playing a traditional Native American cedar flute after an accident left him unable to play the trumpet. Largely self-taught, he released his first album Changes in 1983, and afterward signed a contract with Canyon Records, who produced more than thirty of his albums in subsequent years. His music prominently features original compositions for the flute inspired by traditional Native American melodies. Nakai has collaborated with musicians who include William Eaton, Philip Glass, Nawang Khechog, Paul Horn, and Keola Beamer. He has received 11 Grammy Award nominations for his albums. Biography =Early life and education= Raymond Carlos Nakai was born in Flagstaff, Arizona on April 16, 1946, to a family of Navajo and Ute descent. He now resides in Tucson, Arizona. As a child he would audition tapes for a Navajo language radio show hosted by his parents; in doing so, he heard a recording of William Hornpipe, a Lakota musician from the Pine Ridge Reservation, playing the flute. When he enrolled in a high school on the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Arizona, he sought to play the flute in the school band, but was assigned the cornet instead, which, he later said, he was less interested in. He began studying at Northern Arizona University in 1966, where he played brass instruments in the marching band. As a second-year student, he was drafted into the United States Navy, and spent two years studying communications and electronics in Hawai'i and the south Pacific. He auditioned for the Royal Hawaiian Band, but was turned down as he was not Hawaiian himself. He continued to receive musical training while in the military. He returned to the Navajo reservation in 1971, where he had a difficult period; several of his classmates had been killed in the Vietnam War. He passed the highly competitive auditions for the Armed Forces School of Music, and was 28th on the waiting list for admission. Playing with the Armed Forces Band became impossible after an auto accident damaged his mouth, making it impossible to produce the correct embouchure to continue playing brass instruments. =Musical career= After his accident, Nakai had a brief struggle with drugs and alcohol. In 1972 he was given a traditional cedar flute, which he gradually taught himself to play, going on to purchase an instrument from Oliver Wendell Jones, a flute maker from California who Nakai met while working as a vendor at a museum. Jones would continue to supply Nakai with flutes for several years. Nakai found it difficult to expand his repertoire due to the absence of recordings or scores for traditional flute music; he therefore began to learn vocal music, and adapted many traditional songs for the flute. He returned to Northern Arizona University to earn a Bachelor's Degree in 1979 and later earned a master's degree in American Indian studies from the University of Arizona. He taught graphic art at a high school until 1983; his wife also worked as a teacher at the time. Nakai began recording his music on cassettes, and selling them on the Navajo Reservation. After a period of little success, he played his music during an exhibition at the Heard Museum, where a representative of Canyon Records bought one of his cassettes. His playing impressed the museum's administrators, who offered him a job; Nakai subsequently worked for the museum for three years. He recorded the album Changes in 1983, and sold it independently; soon afterward, he signed a contract with Canyon Records, who would release more than thirty of his recordings over the next decades. By 2016, Nakai had recorded more than thirty commercial albums with Canyon records and several more with other producers, and had sold more than 3.5 million records. These recordings included several collaborations, including with the Japanese folk ensemble Wind Travelin' Band, the Philadelphia Orchestra's Israeli cellist Udi Bar-David, guitarist William Eaton, American composer Philip Glass, Tibetan flutist Nawang Khechog, flutist Paul Horn, and slack key guitar player Keola Beamer. =Genre and style= Nakai's music prominently features improvisations on the Native American cedar flute. He also plays the eagle-bone whistle, and uses synthesizers, chanting, and sounds from nature. Although he occasionally plays arrangements of traditional melodies, most of his music attempts to \\"[create] original compositions that capture the essence of his heritage in highly personalized ways.\\" Nakai states: \\"I build upon the tribal context, while still retaining its essence. Much of what I do builds upon and expresses the environment and experience that I‚Äôm having at the moment.\\" His collaborations have included works produced with musicians of different genres, including jazz, western classical music, and traditional music from different parts of the world. Nakai also composed a few \\"light-hearted\\" orchestral works. Although his music has been popular among enthusiasts of New Age music, he has disagreed with that categorization. =Recognition and legacy= Many of Nakai's records have been critically and commercially successful. Two albums, Earth Spirit (1987) and Canyon Trilogy (1989), were certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Music review website AllMusic called Canyon Trilogy in its simplicity\\", and referred to Earth Spirit as \\"an outstanding CD from a soulful man.\\" Nakai's 1995 collaboration with William Eaton, Feather, Stone, and Light, topped the New Age music album charts for 13 weeks, and was listed as a Billboard Critic's choice. He has been nominated for the Grammy Award eleven times: first in 1993 for Ancestral Voices in the Best Traditional Folk Album category, and later eight times in the Best New Age Album category, and twice in the Best Native American Album category. He has been described as one of the \\"most prolific and innovative artists\\" within his genre. Nakai developed a system of tablature notation, commonly known as Nakai tablature, that could be used to represent Native American music in a notation similar to that of Western classical music. It could be used across different flute types, as notes in it corresponded to intervals from the fundamental frequency of the flute, rather than to an absolute frequency. Nakai was featured on the 1999 film Songkeepers, which depicted five Native American flute players ‚Äî Nakai, Tom Mauchahty-Ware, Sonny Nevaquaya, Hawk Littlejohn, Kevin Locke ‚Äî talking about their instruments and songs, and the role of the flute and its music in their tribes. Nakai's 1985 composition Cycles was used by the Martha Graham Dance Company in 1988 as the music for its ballet Nightchant. In 1993, Nakai played the flute as a soloist for the Phoenix Symphony's world premiere of a concerto for the ceder flute, composed by James DeMars. In 2005, Nakai was inducted into the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame. Nakai was awarded the Arizona Governor's Arts Award in 1992. He received an honorary doctorate from Northern Arizona University in 1994, and the NAUAA Dwight Patterson (1934) Alumnus of the Year Award in 2001. The Library of Congress has more than 30 of his recordings preserved in the American Folklife Center. Discography Nakai's first album was released in 1983 by Canyon Records. He has since released forty other albums through Canyon and appeared on other labels in guest appearances.  Publications  * References External links * R. Carlos Nakai * R.

Its origins date to the 1820s, when colleges of medicine and law were established. In 1942, the various faculties merged into the University of Haiti. After a student strike in 1960, Fran√ßois Duvalier's government brought the university under firm government control and renamed it the State University of Haiti. In 1983, the University became an independent institution according to the Haitian constitution. The University's independent status was confirmed in the Haitian constitution of 1987. In 1981, there were 4,099 students at the University of Haiti, of whom 26% were enrolled in the School of Law and Economics, 25% in the School of Medicine and Pharmacy, 17% in the School of Administration and Management, and 11% in the School of Science and Topography. Despite the important role played by agriculture in the Haitian economy, only 5% of the university's students were enrolled in the School of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine. In 1981, the University of Haiti had 559 professors, compared to 207 in 1967. Most professors worked part-time, were paid on an hourly basis, and had little time for contact with students. UEH also suffered severe shortages of books and other materials. As of 2010, tuition was US$15 a year. However, while this made it more affordable for many Haitians than other forms of tertiary education in the country, competition for places was fierce. The university accepted only 15% of applicants for undergraduate places, while its dentistry school had just 20 places for about 800 applicants yearly. The Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti, Campus Henri Christophe de Limonade Among its past rectors, the University includes the writer, Jean Price Mars. The university's buildings were largely destroyed during the earthquake of January 12, 2010. A consortium of historically black colleges in the United States was formed to help rebuild part of the campus. After the earthquake, the government of the Dominican Republic paid for the construction of a new university campus near the town of Limonade in northern Haiti, called the Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti, Campus Henri Christophe de Limonade. √âditions de l'Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti The √âditions de l'Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti (State University Press of Haiti) was launched in 2006 with Professor H√©rard Jadotte at its helm as Director. Its mission is to promote research through the publication and dissemination of scientific texts, to diversify the documentary resources for the academic community and the general public and to improve university education. The √âditions de l'Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti publishes scientific and didactic works for teachers and researchers, the best end-of-studies dissertations supported at UEH, classics belonging to the Haitian intellectual heritage, research published abroad of interest to the academic community, scientific journals, and symposium proceedings. By June 2014 it had a catalogue of 70 academic and research publications, with another 20 titles slated to launch in the fall.

In addition to running international operations, the RDA is also a member of the international umbrella group, the Federation Riding for the Disabled International. In the UK, the association is one of 16 members that make up the British Equestrian Federation. History The Ancient Greeks as early as 600 B.C. and later the Romans recognised the therapeutic value of horseback riding. In Europe, France in particular, had documented the therapeutic use of horse riding as early as 1875. More recently, in the United Kingdom, Dame Agnes Hunt at the Orthopaedic Hospital at Oswestry during 1901 employed similar techniques. Later Miss Olive Sands MCSP took her horses to the Oxford Hospital to provide riding for the rehabilitation of soldiers wounded in the trenches during the First World War. The achievements of Lis Hartel of Denmark are generally regarded as the impetus for the formation of therapeutic horseback riding centres throughout Europe. Polio had impaired Hartel‚Äôs mobility but not her spirit. In 1952 she won the silver medal for Individual Dressage during the Helsinki Olympics. Medical and equine professionals took notice and very soon centres for therapeutic horseback riding began to form throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. In 1951 Elsbet Bodtker, having met Liz Hartel, was inspired to give lessons to young patients on her son‚Äôs ponies. She was uniquely qualified as an international rider and a Mensendieck physiotherapist, and so had the respect and approval of the doctors. In the United Kingdom Norah Strang, a member of the British Polio Fellowship, organized riding for children disabled by polio, at Tyne and Wear riding centre. Her riders won the first national competition at Stoke Mandeville Hospital sports centre. In 1957 another remarkable lady, Mrs. Jacques, made contact with a physiotherapist in Copenhagen. By this time she had organized a team of helpers and ponies, and was offering riding to a local orthopaedic hospital. She also met Mrs. Regester who had returned from Malaya where she had been teaching disabled children to ride for some years at the request of their doctors. Although the British medical profession was still cautious, after watching a demonstration by Mrs. Jacques and her riders at the Knightsbridge Barracks, the senior physiotherapist at St. Thomas‚Äô Hospital was impressed. This was the start of a long and successful partnership. Mrs. Jacques had so many enquiries that she was convinced they should start their own riding centre. The result was Grange Farm in Chigwell. A number of groups were set up by the British Red Cross Society, all of these eventually coming under the RDA umbrella. The Princess Anne opened Hadleigh RDA on 13 June 1985. The original formation of the organisation came about during 1965, but the Charity, The Riding for the Disabled Association did not come into being until 1969. At that time Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk was president, with the Princess Anne as Patron. The RDA became a Limited Company during 2004. The RDA is in effect a Federation of some 500 small independent groups, such as The Shelley Centre, and currently supports over 26,500 adults and children by providing riding, carriage driving and vaulting each year. In 1996 equestrian became a Paralympic sport at the Games in Atlanta. It was the largest event in Paralympics history, with 122 countries participating and it is now possible for those coming into the RDA who have the right ability and skill to eventually represent their Country as Paralympic competitors by progression through organised RDA events both regionally and nationally with the likes of Competitions held annually at Hartpury College. From simple beginnings, the organisation has progressed in sophistication and has benefited greatly from the advice, training and guidance given by specialist Physiotherapists where planning and treatment programmes are developed for individuals, both children and adults alike. This, together with the introduction and evolution of special Saddles, Stirrups and Reins and the use of formal and protective riding clothing have added further to the development process and professionalism of the organisation. The organisation, at a few locations, now has in place sophisticated computerised mechanical horses, one of which is at The Shelley Centre, which can emulate the walk, trot and canter paces of a real horse thus enabling riders who for various reasons cannot ride an actual horse to experience the therapeutic benefits of horse riding. The Riding for the Disabled Association is not confined to the UK. That vision has spread around the world. RDA Centres now operate in over 45 countries in Europe, Asia, The Americas, and Oceania.

Its two most prominent components are Sunrise Highway and Montauk Highway, the latter of which includes the Montauk Point State Parkway. NY 27 acts as the primary east-west highway on southern Long Island east of the interchange with the Heckscher State Parkway in Islip Terrace. The entire route in Suffolk, Nassau, and Queens counties were designated by the New York State Senate as the POW/MIA Memorial Highway. The highway gives access to every town on the South Shore. NY 27 is the easternmost state route in the state of New York. NY 27 has service roads that parallel the highway continuously from North Lindenhurst to Patchogue, and intermittently to the east into Southampton. They are officially designated, but not signed, as New York State Route 906C and New York State Route 906D. Route description =Prospect Expressway and Linden Boulevard= NY 27 begins at exit 24 of I-278 (the Gowanus Expressway) in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. For the first stretch through Brooklyn, NY 27 runs along the Prospect Expressway ‚Äî a sunken six-lane freeway through the Park Slope and Windsor Terrace neighborhoods ‚Äî providing interchanges with Fourth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and 11th Avenue. At exit 5, eastbound NY 27 leaves the Prospect Expressway, which then interchanges with Ocean and Fort Hamilton Parkways before ending a short distance to the south at exit 6 and Church Avenue. Eastbound NY 27 follows East 5th Street to Caton Avenue; westbound NY 27 leaves Caton Avenue at Coney Island Avenue, then follows Church Avenue to the Prospect Expressway. The Prospect Expressway at exit 3 as seen from Prospect Park West in Brooklyn NY 27 runs along Caton Avenue near the south end of Prospect Park. A couple blocks east, the street merges into Linden Boulevard, crossing eastward through Brooklyn on Linden. NY 27 passes east through East Flatbush and reaches a large intersection with Kings Highway and Remsen Avenue, where it expands into a four-lane boulevard through Brooklyn with frontage roads. East of East 96th Street, NY 27 intersects Rockaway Parkway and then travels under the BMT Canarsie Line, winding through New Lots before turning northeast. After crossing under a nearby subway yard, the boulevard passes through the City Line neighborhood. Near the junction with Ruby Street, NY 27 enters the borough of Queens, but retains the Linden Boulevard name. =Conduit Avenue= Continuing northeast through Queens, NY 27 and Linden Boulevard enter Ozone Park and reach an interchange with Conduit Avenue, where Linden Boulevard ends. NY 27 then continues eastward along the divided Conduit Avenues. This portion of the route becomes a controlled access highway, coterminous with the western portion of Nassau Expressway (NY 878) starting at Cross Bay Boulevard until Aqueduct Road. (When constructed, the portion from Linden Boulevard until what is now Aqueduct Road, was designated Sunrise Highway. This is not to be confused with present Sunrise Highway, which is at the other end of Queens. Sunrise became Conduit at 111th Street, which no longer exists, but is approximately where Aquedecut Road currently crosses over Route 27.) When the Nassau Expressway splits off, NY 27 continues east along Conduit Avenue and remains a frontage road for multiple exits of the Belt Parkway. The route interchanges with I-678 (the Van Wyck Expressway) a short distance later. NY 27 remains a frontage road entering Springfield Gardens, crossing multiple exits of the Belt Parkway until entering Laurelton. In Laurelton, the Belt Parkway turns northward while NY 27 continues eastbound as South Conduit Avenue and westbound as Sunrise Highway, but stays a seven- lane divided boulevard (four eastbound and three westbound). The route crosses Francis Lewis Boulevard and south of the Rosedale Long Island Rail Road station; just east of Hook Creek Boulevard, NY 27 enters Nassau County and becomes the Sunrise Highway. =Sunrise Highway= Sunrise Bridge over the Shinnecock Canal Sunrise Highway begins as a six to eight-lane arterial highway in eastern Queens. It heads east into Nassau County, passing through Valley Stream and Rockville Centre on its way to Merrick. There it connects to the Meadowbrook State Parkway by way of an interchange. NY 27 continues to Wantagh, where it has an interchange with the Wantagh State Parkway. One mile later, the highway has an interchange with NY 135 in Seaford. NY 27 then enters Suffolk County, where it veers to the northeast, bypassing Copiague. At the interchange with NY 109 in West Babylon, Sunrise Highway becomes a six- lane expressway with two two-lane service roads. The route then meets the Robert Moses Causeway near West Islip. In East Patchogue, New York, the highway is reduced to a four-lane expressway after passing the NY 112 exit. Between County Route 16 (CR 16) in Brookhaven and CR 46 in Shirley, the median is lined with pine trees along South Haven County Park. The setting along these roads is similar to the one on the Southern State Parkway west of Belmont Lake State Park. The last exit with a state highway is near Hampton Bays, where it meets NY 24\\\\. East of NY 24, Sunrise Highway crosses over the Shinnecock Canal and has one last eastbound exit before merging with CR 39\\\\. It changes names to North Highway, a four-lane undivided highway more commonly known as the Southampton Bypass. The highway continues east near toward village of Southampton before ending at an intersection with Montauk Highway. NY 27 turns east at that junction, following Montauk Highway toward Water Mill and points east. When originally built in the 1920s, the Conduit Avenue portion of the route in Queens and Brooklyn was also designated Sunrise Highway, but the name fell into disuse for those portions. =Montauk Highway= NY 27 in Montauk Point State Park The section of Montauk Highway over which NY 27 runs is two lanes wide, with the exception of the four-lane sections in the village of East Hampton. This section of NY 27 is concurrent with New York State Bicycle Route 27\\\\. NY 27 heads generally northeastward to East Hampton village where it becomes Woods Lane, and later, Main Street. It has an intersection with the southern end of NY 114 before entering downtown. After passing Newtown Lane and North Main Street, NY 27's name changes to Pantigo Road, as it passes an eponymous historic district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the hamlet of Amagansett, NY 27's name changes back to Main Street, again returning to the Montauk Highway name. The road becomes Montauk Point State Parkway as it enters Hither Hills State Park in Napeague. The parkway, a Robert Moses-designed highway, carries NY 27 to its eastern terminus at Montauk Point State Park, on the east side of Montauk. The final 10 miles (16 Kilometers) of NY 27 is known as Montauk Point State Parkway. History =Designation and early realignments= NY 27's designation was assigned in the mid-1920s to a road extending from the New York City line to Amagansett. It began at the point where Merrick Road exited Queens and entered Nassau County. It mostly followed Merrick Road and Montauk Highway east to Amagansett. From East Patchogue to Brookhaven, NY 27 followed South Country Road, passing through the downtown section of the village of Bellport. The NY 27 designation was extended eastward along Montauk Highway to Montauk Point by 1930. On February 24, 1930, South Country Road was added to the Suffolk County highway system as CR 36. NY 27 was subsequently realigned to follow Montauk Highway between East Patchogue and Brookhaven. NY 27 was realigned west of Oakdale to follow Sunrise Boulevard, a new highway parallel to Merrick Road, and then Montauk Highway, between the New York City line and Massapequa connecting several local roads from Massapequa to Montauk Highway at Oakdale. The former routing of NY 27 from Massapequa to Oakdale became NY 27A, connecting to NY 27 in Massapequa by way of County Line Road. Sunrise Boulevard was extended eastward to Oakdale as a realignment of NY 27. One portion of NY 27's former route between NY 27A in Massapequa and the Suffolk County line is known as Old Sunrise Highway, and remains state-maintained to this day as NY 900D, an unsigned reference route. Sunrise Highway was built over the Brooklyn Waterworks aqueduct, past the south side of Aqueduct Racetrack. =New York City= In December 1934, the route was extended westward into New York City. NY 27 followed Sunrise Highway, Linden Boulevard, and Flatbush Avenue through Queens and Brooklyn to the Manhattan Bridge, where it continued into Manhattan along Canal Street to a terminus at 6th Avenue (then-U.S. Route 1A and later NY 1A). The route was realigned slightly in the early 1940s to follow Atlantic and Washington Avenues, Eastern Parkway, Buffalo Avenue, and Rockaway Avenue between Flatbush Avenue and Linden Boulevard. NY 27 was again altered in the mid-1960s to continue west on Linden Boulevard, Caton Avenue, and Church Avenue to the south end of the Prospect Expressway. There, the route turned north, following the freeway to its end at the Gowanus Expressway (then-NY 27A), where NY 27A now ends. The Prospect Expressway was planned by Robert Moses, and was constructed during the 1950s. Prior to 1970, NY 27A continued north to the Holland Tunnel in Manhattan by way of the Gowanus Expressway, the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel, and the West Side Elevated Highway. On January 1, 1970, NY 27A was truncated eastward to its current western terminus in Massapequa while NY 27 was extended northward along NY 27A's former route to the Holland Tunnel, where it ends at I-78 and NY 9A. By 1973, NY 27 was cut back to its interchange with the Gowanus Expressway while I-478 was assigned to both the Battery Tunnel and all of the West Side Elevated Highway south of the Lincoln Tunnel. =Long Island= Robert Moses developed plans for an elevated expressway featuring 10 to 12 lanes along Sunrise Highway through Nassau County. This expressway would have provided a truck link for the South Shore of Long Island but the downtown villages along the route effectively put a stop to the idea. Sunrise Highway becomes a limited-access highway at NY 109\\\\. The portion of Sunrise Highway between North Lindenhurst and the town of Southampton was gradually upgraded to a limited-access highway. At the east end of NY 27 the highway abruptly became a three-lane highway east of the Shinnecock Canal, at the point where NY 27 is concurrent with CR 39\\\\. This area was known as the \\"Shinnecock Squeeze\\" as traffic on the two-lane eastbound NY 27 was \\"squeezed\\" into a single lane. In 2006 and 2007 Suffolk County and Southampton officials began using traffic cones to adjust the lanes to accommodate peak travel in what was called the \\"traffic cone program\\". At the end of summer 2007, another eastbound lane was added, heading eastward to North Sea Road. The construction snarled traffic on CR 39\\\\. The Long Island Rail Road added three trains each way between Speonk and East Hampton during the construction. In April 2008, the three-lane segment from North Sea Road to Flying Point Road was reconfigured from one eastbound and two westbound lanes to two eastbound and one westbound lane. The merge from two lanes to one in the eastbound direction is now assisted by a signalized intersection at Flying Point Road, where eastbound NY 27 traffic makes a left turn onto Montauk Highway. This widening project eliminates the \\"Shinnecock Squeeze.\\" Eastward extension The first proposals for an extension east of the Shinnecock Canal were made in the 1950s. In 1969, the New York Legislature approved a $160 million plan for the extension. It was a limited-access route, flanked by bicycle and equestrian trails. The eastbound and westbound roadways were to be separated by wide wooded medians. For the most part, the road was to run a mile or two north of existing NY 27, thus avoiding the populated centers through which it now passes. The extended Sunrise Highway would have had interchanges with CR 38 (North Sea Road) and CR 39 (County Road), CR 79 (Bridgehampton‚ÄìSag Harbor Road), NY 114 (East Hampton‚ÄìSag Harbor Turnpike), CR 40 (Three Mile Harbor Road), and CR 45 (Amagansett‚ÄìSprings Road) before merging back into the existing Montauk Highway. The exits would have been sequentially numbered from 67 to 72. The plan failed, and Governor Hugh Carey canceled it in 1975. Other suggestions have included building a limited-access road on either side of Long Island Rail Road's Montauk Branch. Older interchanges As Sunrise Highway was upgraded during the 1970s and 1980s many interchanges were redesigned and replaced. The original interchange with the Robert Moses Causeway in West Islip had two parkway-style arch bridges over two lanes of NY 27\\\\. When the service roads were built in Western Islip Township between 1969 and 1972, parkway-style bridges were added for them as well. The interchanges at Fifth Ave and Brentwood Road in Bay Shore had parkway-style arch bridges and cloverleaves. When the service roads were added, the parkway-style bridges were removed and replaced with the modern structures that exist today and the original cloverleaves were modified to align with the new service roads. As with interchanges to the west, Islip Avenue (NY 111) and Carleton Avenue (CR 17) in Islip Terrace originally had parkway-style bridges crossing over Sunrise Highway. However, only Islip Ave had a partial cloverleaf on the west side of the bridge. The eastern side of the bridge used side streets for access, as did both sides of the Carleton Ave bridge. This section of Sunrise Highway wasn't divided. Since 1983, both areas have more modern bridges over the service roads, and the old cross streets connect to those service roads or other side roads instead. Islip Avenue connects to NY 27 at exit 45 while Carleton Avenue meets the Sunrise Highway at exit 46. Proposed interchanges and crossings Besides the replacement of interchanges in Western Suffolk County, Sunrise Highway has had proposed interchanges and crossings that were either never built or were built according to alternate design specifications. In the North Lindenhurst area, plans to construct a cloverleaf interchange with CR 2 (Straight Path) in Copiague have existed for some time. In recent years, planners have realized that such an interchange would be too close to the cloverleafs with CR 47 (Great Neck Road) to the west and CR 3 (Wellwood Road) to the east. To further complicate matters, a widened CR 28 was extended to Sunrise Highway near the Straight Path intersection in the late-1980s. To date, no interchange has been built for this area. The Oakdale Merge is a convergence of Sunrise Highway and Montauk Highway between Great River and Oakdale abutting the southern edge of Connetquot River State Park. The Montauk Highway predates the Sunrise Highway in the area. When Sunrise Highway was extended east of Amityville in 1940, it terminated at Montauk Highway's entrance to Connetquot River State Park. In 1953, Sunrise Highway was extended to East Patchogue; a overlap of NY 27 and NY 27A was created, with at-grade intersections connecting the highways.Hagstrom's Atlas of Western Suffolk County, New York (1958, and other years) A segment of this alignment remains south of the eastern interchange. NY 27A was truncated east of the overlap in 1972. Plans to upgrade the interchange have existed since its creation. During the early-1960s, the Suffolk County Department of Public Works considered designating a county highway to connect Nicolls Road in Lake Grove through the Long Island MacArthur Airport, then on to the east end of the merge. As recently as 1981, the New York State Department of Transportation planned to add service roads and a proper interchange at both ends of the merge. Pressure from environmental groups seeking to avoid damaging the parkland stalled construction. NYSDOT eventually reconstructed Sunrise Highway in eastern Islip township into a freeway during the 1990s, resulting in the present configuration. The entrance to Connetquot River Park remained as an at-grade intersection, accessible only from the westbound lane. Former segments of Montauk Highway now exist on both sides of the interchange, and sections of both roads were converted into fishing areas owned by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Numerous accidents occurred at the east end of the merge, resulting in its reconstruction in 1999. A new off-ramp to the service road for Pond Road was built, resulting in renumbering of exit 47 to exit 46A. While none of the interchanges north of Patchogue were built until 1988 to 1993, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) had known the need for them and had planned them decades before their eventual construction. As an example, Waverly Avenue (CR 19) was originally proposed as a cloverleaf interchange. Today, exit 52 with CR 19 is a diamond interchange instead. North Ocean Avenue (CR 83) was originally proposed to be accessible via connecting ramps to side streets including Austin Street along the eastbound lane and Sinn Street along the westbound lane. Today, exit 53A is a half-diamond interchange while Austin Street and Howard Street are now dead-end streets, and Sinn Street never reached North Ocean Avenue. Maple Avenue had crossed the median on NY 27 between North Ocean Avenue and NY 112 until 1975. This road could also have been used as a connecting ramp to both roads. Today, the north section only intersects the westbound service road, while the south section was converted into a dead-end street north of Austin Street. NY 112 was originally proposed to be accessible via connecting ramps to side streets such as Franklin Street along the eastbound lane and an extension of Sinn Street along the westbound lane. Sinn Street was acquired by NYSDOT east of NY 112 in the early-1960s, and was gradually abandoned. Today, exit 53 is a diamond interchange, and Sinn Street, Austin Street, and Franklin Street are now dead-end streets. Originally there were proposals to connect Washington Avenue and Phyllis Drive via ramps to side streets such as Franklin Street along the eastbound lane, and to an extension of Sinn Street along the westbound lane. Phyllis Drive was once part of NY 27 until Sunrise Highway was extended to Eastport in 1957. Today, both roads are only accessible via the service roads. Some residents are waiting for a potential pedestrian bridge connecting the two ends of Washington Avenue. West of the Carmans River near Southaven County Park in South Haven, there was a plan to combine the eastbound service road with Montauk Highway, similar to the Oakdale Merge. NY 27A right NY 27A () is an alternate route of NY 27 across southern Long Island from Massapequa Park to Oakdale, accessing Babylon and Islip. It was designated NY 27A .

She was called \\"the most influential oil journalist of her time\\" in Daniel Yergin's The Prize.  Early life and education  Jablonski was the daughter of Polish petroleum geologist Eugene Jablonski, and was immersed in the oil industry throughout her childhood. She studied at St George's School, Harpenden in England until July 1937, where she gained her school certificate and got the form prize in July 1938 before leaving to study in America. She and her parents traveled widely, and although she became an American citizen, she developed great sympathy for other cultures ‚Äì an attribute which as an adult enabled her to make deep contacts across the world oil industry, from the multinational oil companies to the leaders of oil-producing countries. Jablonski earned a B.A. from Cornell University in 1942 and an M.A. from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism the following year.  Career  Jablonski began as the oil editor at the Journal of Commerce, where she made her mark with a 1948 interview in Caracas with Juan Pablo P√©rez Alfonso, then the Venezuelan oil minister, which cleverly synthesized the developing nations' viewpoint, in those days rarely heard in the Western hemisphere. She moved to Petroleum Week journal in 1954 and cemented her reputation, speaking on equal terms with oil ministers and company chairmen. A rare woman in a man's world, she was known throughout the oil industry simply as \\"Wanda\\". She is credited with arranging the 1959 Cairo meeting where Abdullah Tariki, Juan Pablo P√©rez Alfonso, and other oil ministers of Middle East signed the \\"Gentleman‚Äôs Agreement,\\" a precursor of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the international organization whose mission is to coordinate the policies of the oil-producing countries. In 1960, Jablonski reported to oil company executives that there was a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against \\"absentee landlordism\\" in the Middle East. \\"From offices in London, New York and Pittsburgh, top executives of oil companies were controlling destinies of Middle East oil-producing states.\\" Ignoring her warning, in August 1960 the major oil companies unilaterally reduced the prices that were used to calculate how much revenue the producing countries received. As a direct result, in September 1960, representatives from oil-producing countries met and formed OPEC. She then founded Petroleum Intelligence Weekly in 1961, the journal which came to be known as \\"the bible of the oil industry\\", and ran it until 1988. Jablonski died in 1992 of heart failure at the age of 71.

Established in Manhattan in 1923, it today maintains a headquarters in Brooklyn Heights with a staff of approximately 70, and small regional offices in other parts of the world. The SSRC offers several fellowships to researchers in the social sciences and related disciplines, including for international fieldwork. __TOC__ History =Early history= The SSRC came into being in 1923 as a result of the initiative of the American Political Science Association's committee on research, headed by the association's president, Charles E. Merriam (1874‚Äì1953), who was political science chair at the University of Chicago and an early champion of behaviorally-oriented social science. Representatives of the American Economic Association, the American Sociological Society, and the American Statistical Association joined with Merriam and his associates in forming the world's first coordinating body of the social sciences. Other national associations‚Äîin anthropology, history, and psychology‚Äîdesignated representatives to the new entity, named the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), in the year following its incorporation on December 27, 1924. (In subsequent years, the membership would expand to include representatives from law, geography, psychiatry, and medicine.) To support its work, the SSRC turned not to the US government, whose support seemed more appropriate for the natural sciences, but to private foundations. For the first fifty years, well over three-quarters of the SSRC's funding was provided by the Russell Sage Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation, and two Rockefeller philanthropies, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial and the Rockefeller Foundation. The SSRC was part of a wider Progressive Era movement to develop organizations of expertise that could dispense disinterested knowledge to policymakers. These organizations would tap leading thinkers in various fields to think creatively about how to address the social and political ills brought on by the Industrial Revolution. Other independent, nongovernmental, policy- minded institutions founded in that era included the American Law Institute (1923), the Brookings Institution (1927), and the Council on Foreign Relations (1921). The Council's main distinguishing feature was its commitment to the advancement of research in the social sciences in the United States.According to an early boilerplate, the purpose of the SSRC was to \\"plan, foster, promote and develop research in the social field.\\" Similar to other Progressive-Era institutions, the SSRC represented a new kind of hybrid‚Äîone that was in some ways defined more by what it wasn't than what it was. It was not a governmental body, thus was removed from the pressures of Washington and public calls for quick-fix solutions to social problems. It was not an academic association‚Äîso was freed from disciplinary boundaries. It was not a university and hence did not have to confront competing demands for services unrelated to research. Along with Merriam, two other individuals were especially vital to the SSRC's early success. One was Wesley Clair Mitchell (1874‚Äì1948), one of the founders of the New School for Social Research and a leading force behind the emergence of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the 1920s. The other was Beardsley Ruml, who had trained in psychometrics at the University of Chicago. Ruml was active in the early phases of Rockefeller philanthropies. He poured Rockefeller resources into the social sciences in general and the SSRC in particular.Worcester, p. 17. All three men channeled their progressive values into the cause of empirical research and knowledge. In his 2001 history of the SSRC, Kenton Worcester highlighted four aspects of their founding vision that remain central to this day:Worcester, pp. 24-26. # Interdisciplinarity: The SSRC was constructed as a platform on which scholars from various disciplines and traditions (including the natural sciences and humanities) could come together in a spirit of problem-solving intellectual cross-fertilization. # Intermediary role: The federal government was not prepared to put its weight behind a central funding agency for the social sciences. Thus the SSRC frequently acted as an intermediary between researchers and research-supporting foundations, assuming the functions of assessing research priorities and disbursing research funds. # Institutional flexibility: The SSRC was designed to be as elastic as possible, to take advantage of changing social conditions and methods of investigation. Even in its early days, the Council's research planning committees were expected to carry out their work for a limited span of time, and for the same reason fellowship programs were kept going only as long as they were judged to be effective. # Scientific advance in the greater interests of society: The SSRC's founders believed that the social sciences should address real-world concerns. They wanted to see social science move in a more data-sensitive, empirical direction. Starting in the mid-1920s the Council sponsored annual conferences and launched its Research Training Fellowships program. Committees launched in the 1920s and 1930s included: * Agriculture (1925‚Äì42) * Crime (1925‚Äì32) * Industrial Relations (1926‚Äì30) * Business Research (1928‚Äì31) * Pressure Groups and Propaganda (1931‚Äì34) * Government Statistics and Information Services (1933‚Äì37) * Social Security (1935‚Äì45) One of the Council's first acts was to urge Congress to appropriate funds sufficient to allow the Library of Congress to publish an annual index of state laws. As early as 1923, the SSRC cooperated with the National Research Council in a study of human migration from a social standpoint, said to be the institution's first global endeavor. Franklin D. Roosevelt served as a member of the Council's Advisory Committee on Business Research (1928‚Äì1931). After he became president, collaborations between administration officials, the Rockefeller Foundation, Council staff, and Council networks led to the committee work that accompanied the formulation and implementation of Social Security.Worcester, p. 23. During World War II, the Council served as a bridge between the Roosevelt administration and the social sciences, working behind the scenes to ensure that qualified social scientists were placed with appropriate agencies.Worcester, p. 27. It joined forces with its humanities counterpart, the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), and other partners to form the Ethnogeographic Board, with the mission of providing information about unfamiliar societies with which the war was suddenly bringing Americans into contact. The Board developed a roster of people with specialized area knowledge and conducted a survey of nascent area studies programs in American universities.Sibley, reprinted in Worcester, p. 191. =Post-World War II= The identity of the Council in the latter half of the 20th century would closely overlap the development of area studiesWorcester, p. 77. and the promotion of modernization theory. In the wake of World War II, there was widespread consensus on the need for the United States to invest in international studies. Liberals and conservatives alike viewed the creation of a large brain trust of internationally oriented political scientists and economists as an urgent national priority. There was considerable tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought that social scientists should seek to develop overarching macrohistorical theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area studies advocates, the latter proponents of modernization theory. In this context, the postwar SSRC had two separate agendas, which to some extent were at odds with each other because they entailed very different sets of methodological commitments: ideographic versus nomothetic. On the one hand, the SSRC was keen to join forces with the country's major foundations‚Äîmost notably, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York‚Äîto promote area studies. For this agenda, it already had a natural institutional partner, the American Council of Learned Societies; indeed, the two councils had worked during the war mapping out US- based foreign studies. On the other hand, the SSRC also wished to promote behavioralist social science‚Äîan agenda that directly descended from Charles Merriam's prewar concerns. To further its interests in area studies, the SSRC teamed up with the ACLS in administering Area Research Training Fellowships with funds from the Carnegie Corporation, and in forming the Committee on World Area Research. In the words of SSRC historian Eldrige Sibley: \\"[T]his committee served as the primary planning, coordinating and evaluating agency at the national level for the entire foreign area and language movement in the United States.\\"Sibley, reprinted in Worcester, p. 192. To further its behavioralist agenda, the SSRC set up various other committees‚Äîincluding, most notably, the Committee on Political Behavior, organized in 1945 by Pendelton Herring and headed at various times by David Truman, David Easton, and Robert Dahl, all of whom would serve as presidents of the American Political Science Association; and the Committee on Comparative Politics, organized in 1953 and headed by Gabriel Almond and then Lucian Pye, both of whom also became APSA presidents. The SSRC's agenda for the behavioral social sciences largely came apart in the 1970s, leaving area studies as its central platform. By then, the SSRC and the ACLS had emerged as the national nexus for raising and administering funds for area studies. They created and managed about a dozen joint committees covering: * Africa (1960‚Äì96) * China (1981‚Äì96) * Eastern Europe (1971‚Äì96) * Japan (1967‚Äì96) * Korea (1967‚Äì96) * Latin America (1942‚Äì47; 1959‚Äì96) * Muslim Societies (1985‚Äì93) * Near and Middle East (1959‚Äì96) * South Asia (1976‚Äì96) * Southeast Asia (1976‚Äì96) * Soviet Union (1983‚Äì96) [successor to Committee on Slavic and East European Studies (1971‚Äì77) and Slavic and East European Studies Committee (1948‚Äì71)] * Western Europe (1975‚Äì96) The joint SSRC-ACLS committees would accomplish most of their work‚Äîfield development workshops, conferences, and publications‚Äîwith funding from the Ford Foundation. In 1972 Ford conferred to the two councils the responsibility for managing its centerpiece program, the Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP). For the next 30 years, the SSRC and the ACLS would award approximately 3,000 area studies dissertation fellowships and, with funds from other foundations as well, another 2,800 postdoctoral area studies research grants. In Kenton Worcester's words: \\"The cumulative total of awards for field research outside the United States was staggering.\\"Statistics are from Worcester, Part Two. Annual reports of the SSRC indicate that the area committees had an impressive record of productivity and influence on area studies and the disciplines they encompassed. In particular, scholars appeared to appreciate the fertile ground the SSRC/ACLS area committees provided for interdisciplinary scholarship. As Korea specialist Bruce Cumings put it: \\"For decades [these committees] offered a rare venue where one could see what a historian thought of the work of an economist, or what a literary critic thought of behavioralist sociology.\\" According to Cumings, the SSRC was particularly appreciated as a meeting ground between traditional social science disciplines and area studies. Even when area studies occupied center stage, the SSRC continued to support advanced research on social themes of the day. In the 1970s and 1980s, it convened committees addressing such topics as cognitive research, law and social science, international peace and security, states and social structures, the urban underclass, and urban migration.Worcester, pp. 65‚Äì72. The Council's forays into non-area studies were limited, however, by the challenges of the funding environment. In the immediate postwar period, the SSRC had benefited from unprecedented federal support of social and domestic programs, as well as increased public attention to social science research. But the growing tide of American conservatism, begun in the 1950s, eventually led to a populist backlash against federal funding of social research. By the time President Ronald Reagan assumed office, the political atmosphere had soured over the role of the social sciences and public investment in social research.Worcester, pp. 57‚Äì60. =Post-Cold War= The end of the Cold War and the quickening pace of globalization turned the future of area studies into the number one issue for Council management in the concluding years of the 20th century. Under the stewardship of four successive presidents‚ÄîDavid Featherman (1989‚Äì1995), Kenneth Prewitt (1995‚Äì1998), Orville Gilbert Brim Jr. (1998‚Äì1999), and Craig Calhoun (1999‚Äì2012)‚Äîthe SSRC closed down its area committees in favor of a reorganized international program with thematic, trans-regional, and cross-cultural components. According to this vision, the area studies field would be transformed and integrated into traditional social science disciplines‚Äîespecially, economics, sociology, and political science. Emphasis would shift from country and area to theme and context- sensitivity.Stanley Heginbotham, 'Rethinking International Scholarship: The Challenge of Transition from the Cold War Era,\\" Items 48.2-3 (June‚ÄìSeptember 1996), p. 32.

Most SSRC fellowships are conducted through peer-reviewed competitions and offer support for predissertation, dissertation, postdoctoral and other research work. And, although most SSRC fellowships target the social sciences, a number also engage the humanities, the natural sciences, and relevant professional and practitioner communities. The SSRC established the Albert O. Hirschman Prize in 2007 to recognize academic excellence in international, interdisciplinary social science research, theory, and public communication in the tradition of German-born American economist Albert O. Hirschman. The Hirschman Prize laureates are Dani Rodrik (2007), Charles Tilly (2009), Benedict Anderson (2011), Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo (2014), Amartya Sen (2016), Sheila Jasanoff (2018), and James Scott (2020).

Notable fellows and committee members Pioneering American political scientist Gabriel Almond (1911‚Äì2002) held awards from the SSRC in 1935‚Äì1936 and again in 1946‚Äì1947. While serving on an SSRC committee, he accomplished critical work in the development of comparative politics as a field. Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph J. Bunche (1903‚Äì1971) held an SSRC research training fellowship in 1936‚Äì1938. Presidential biographer James MacGregor Burns (born 1918) has held two SSRC awards: a demobilization award in 1946‚Äì1947, and a research training award in 1949. Historian John Hope Franklin (1915‚Äì2009) was a recipient of an SSRC fellowship in the early part of his career. From 1956 to 1961, he served on the SSRC's long-running Grants-in-Aid Committee. Canadian-American economist John Kenneth Galbraith (1908‚Äì2006) had a research training fellowship in 1937‚Äì1938. Historian Peter Gay (born 1923) was a research training fellow in 1950‚Äì1951. Morris Janowitz (1919‚Äì1988), a prominent sociologist at the University of Chicago who specialized in the sociology of the military, received a demobilization award, 1946‚Äì1947. Simon Kuznets (1901‚Äì1985), a Nobel laureate in economics, led the SSRC Committee on Economic Growth from 1949‚Äì1968. His long involvement with the SSRC began in 1925, when he was a research fellow studying economic patterns in prices. In 1961, Kuznets headed a new SSRC committee on the Economy of China. Harold D. Lasswell (1902‚Äì1978) was among the earliest SSRC research fellows (1928‚Äì1929). He went on to become a prominent political scientist and president of ASPA. Owen Lattimore (1900‚Äì1089), a prominent anthropologist of China and Central Asia, especially Mongolia, held a research fellowship in 1929‚Äì1930. Political sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset (1922‚Äì2006) held a field fellowship in 1945‚Äì1946. One of the results was his award-winning book Political Man (1960), which remains thought provoking to this day. World-renowned cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead (1901‚Äì1978) held a research fellowship in 1928‚Äì1929. Economist and Nobel laureate Douglass C.

Hegg lives with wife Peggy Hegg in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Hegg is best known for selling 1.5 million copies of his first book, A Cup of Christmas Tea, illustrated by Warren Hanson. Hegg and Hanson's working relationship continued with nine more illustrated books including three books featuring a colorful bear named Peef. Hegg has also collaborated on The Handsome Prince with illustrator Kevin Cannon. Hegg wrote A Cup of Christmas Tea in 1981, when his pastor asked him to write something for his church's 125th anniversary. Drawing on childhood memories, he composed a straightforward, sentimental poem that brought tears to his audience's eyes. First published in 1982, it's been a seasonal best-seller ever since. Hegg's subsequent books have included Mark of the Maker, which focuses on Joseph, father of Jesus; Up to the Lake, a collection of poems focused around a family's trip to their vacation home, the \\"Peef\\" series of books about the adventures of a teddy bear, and To Nourish Any Flower: The Request Collection, which is a collection of poems he wrote and presented to family, friends, and students over the course of several years. Tom Hegg taught drama at Breck School in Golden Valley, Minnesota, from the early 1980s until 2016. Hegg received the honor of being named a Master Teacher.Breck School Faculty Awards and Recognition website. Many of his students have gone on to successful careers in the dramatic arts; probably the most famous of them is Marisa Coughlan. Erik Stolhanske, a member of the Broken Lizard Comedy group, was also a student, and starred alongside Coughlan. Charlie Korsmo also was a student of Hegg's, but this was after most of his films. Bobby McFerrin's son was enrolled at Breck and performed in at least one major Breck musical production directed by Hegg when McFerrin served as a Guest Conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra.

Taunggyi is the fifth largest city of Myanmar, and has an estimated population of 380,665 as of 2014. The city is famous for its hot air balloon festival held annually on the full moon day of Tazaungmon.  Etymology  The name Taunggyi means \\"huge mountain\\" in the Burmese language, and is named after the ridge on the east of the city, part of the Shan Hills system, whose prominent high point is called Taung-chun or \\"The Spur.\\" Locally this spur is popularly known as Phaya Taung. The ridge has a more prominent and more popular feature known as Chauk Talone, meaning the Craigs.  History  Prior to British colonisation, Taunggyi was a small village of a few huts. The area lay on a wide shoulder of the Sittaung Hills of the Shan Hills and was populated by the Shan people at the time. The signs of the original village of Taunggyi are long gone, but nearby villages can still be discerned quite easily. During British occupation, the town became the chief city and capital of the Southern Shan States. Taunggyi's modern development began in 1894, when the British moved their administrative offices from Maing Thauk (Fort Stedman) on the eastern shores of Inle Lake to the higher elevation of Taunggyi, for health and geographical reasons. Although geographically within the state of Yawnghwe, the town was denoted as a \\"notified area\\" by the British, exempt from the Sawbwa's administration. By 1906, there existed a thousand houses. Because of civil unrest throughout the Shan States during the early 1900s, Taunggyi served as the chief garrison for military police. Taunggyi also served as a supply centre for the Shan States, and catered to persons of many nationalities. Geography Taunggyi city in 1961 Taunggyi is at an elevation of above sea level. It sits on a high intermontaine basin (erroneously called a plateau) that rapidly descends to the western lowland river valleys that make up central Myanmar, but is otherwise surrounded by mountain range. The city is from Yangon (Rangoun) by road. Climate Taunggyi has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cwa), closely bordering a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). There is a winter dry season (December‚ÄìMarch) and a summer wet-season (April‚ÄìNovember). Temperatures are warm throughout the year; the winter months (December‚ÄìFebruary) are milder but the nights can be quite cool. Transportation The main access to Taunggyi is by the mountainous road. A railway line that passes through Taunggyi was recently built in 1995, but at the moment it offers no passenger service to Taunggyi. Regular railway passenger service to the rest of the country is through the town of Shwenyaung, to the west. The nearest airport is Heho Airport, about an hour driving distance, by road to the west of Taunggyi. Heho Airport has regular flights to Yangon, Mandalay and Bagan. Culture The Guan Yin Buddhist Monastery (Kwan Yin Si Hpaya Kyaung) in Taunggyi serves the local Chinese community. St. Joseph's Cathedral in Taunggyi serves as the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Taunggyi. St.George Anglican Church Taunggyi is the melting pot for the Myelat area of the Shan State. Like in most of Myanmar, influence of Buddhism is most evidenced by the monasteries scattered throughout the city. However, being a relatively new city, the monasteries are not of historical significance and architecturally not unique. There is also a significant Christian population, as the center of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Taunggyi the St. Joseph's Cathedral and its associated seminary are the main facilities, as well as a Baptist church. Both churches were established by early missionaries. There is also a smaller Anglican church, which originally served the British administrators, but recently it has fallen into a state of disrepair. Four mosques serve the Muslim communities of the city. Among four mosques, Panthay mosque serves the Chinese Panthay Muslims mainly. The other mosques are for large population of Burmese Muslims. There are also a few temples serving the Chinese Buddhist community. After 1990s, Chinese migrants are settling in Taunggyi and now they constitute the considerable proportion in communities. The Taunggyi celebration of the Tazaungdaing Festival, a national holiday marking the end of the rainy season, has achieved international notoriety. \\"...balloons with large fireworks displays attached are sent airborne - but if they don't rise quickly enough, the pyrotechnics rocket back towards to crowds - sending people scattering. Videos of balloons engulfed in flames exploding amongst onlookers have become wildly popular on YouTube.\\"\\"Taunggyi's fire balloon festival\\". The Myanmar Times. There were nine people injured in 2018, two deaths and 12 injuries in 2017, and four deaths in 2014. Being the capital of the Shan State, Taunggyi hosts many government offices. The city also hosts Eastern Command of the Tatmadaw (Myanmar military) and it occupies a significant portion of the north-east area of the city.Shan State Cultural Museum lies in Taunggyi. The museum displays the Shan culture, as well as items of historical interest, such as the belongings of Sawbwa.  Economy  = Tourism = The Taunggyi area is a popular tourist destination. The city itself has an interesting five-day market, where farmers from around the area would come to the Taunggyi on market day and sell fresh produce in the open market, but with more development of the city, the significance of market day has been lessened. However, the market-day tradition continues strong in the outlying small towns. Nearby, Inle Lake is the home of the unique Intha culture. Inlay is famous for its traditional crafts industry and floating markets that are accessible via traditional longboats. The most unique thing is that Intha row the boat with their leg. On the way to the Pindaya Caves provides visitors with a good view of the Myelat countryside. Near Taunggyi, in Kekku, there are hundreds of stupas which dates back to 16th century. = Industry = There is no significant industry in Taunggyi. It used to be the trans-shipment point for many of the agricultural products of southern Shan State. However, due to recently imposed zoning regulations, most of these operations have been moved to the surrounding new town of Ayetharyar. = Agriculture = Another economy of Taunggyi is farming and gardening. Farmers around Taunggyi are mostly Shan and Pa-O ethnic origins. The main agricultural products of Taunggyi are potatoes, tea leaf, tomato, beans, damson and seasonal fruits.  Education  The city is home to: * Taunggyi University * University of Computer Studies,Taunggyi * University of Medicine,Taunggyi * Technological University, Taunggyi * Taunggyi Education College  Sports  The 7,000-seat Taunggyi Stadium is a multi-use stadium in Taunggyi.

The group performs early music as well as traditional music, particularly from Quebec and France, in period costume. The Ensemble is led by recorder player Gilles Plante. The Ensemble Claude-Gervais was formed in Montreal in 1967 by four flutists or recorder players: Gilles Plante, Fran√ßois Barre, Jean Gagn√©, and Joseph Guilmette. The group took its name from Claude Gervaise, a French Renaissance composer, editor and arranger (fl. in Paris ca. 1540‚Äì1560), who was mainly known for his instrumental music. Between 1971 and 1975, the ensemble published a quarterly review entitled Carnet musical. Michael Desroches was the publisher, and Jean-Pierre Pinson was the editor. The current group maintains a core of ten members, all of whom are also singers and dancers. Most group members have been members or students of the Faculty of Music and the Institute of Medieval Studies at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Many group members of the group have studied the works of medieval and renaissance theorists, including Arbeau and Mersenne. The Ensemble Claude- Gervais has given concerts throughout North America and Europe, and its recordings have often been featured on television and radio broadcasts by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1988, the group performed a series of concerts in Montreal churches. Two years later, at the 1990 Festival international de Lanaudi√®re, they performed music from the court of Francis I of France. The ensemble maintains a large collection of over three hundred string, wind and percussion instruments. Some of these are rare originals.

The film is an homage to blaxploitation films of the 1970s and incorporates numerous elements from the genre. It initially met with negative reviews and a dismal box-office performance, but has since been reappraised as a cult classic, especially for Snoop Dogg and Pam Grier's performances and Dickerson's direction. Plot In 1979, Jimmy Bones (Snoop Dogg) is a numbers runner who is loved in his neighborhood as its respected member and protector. He is betrayed and brutally murdered by corrupt cop Lupovich (Michael T. Weiss) and drug pusher Eddie Mack (Ricky Harris) who then force Jimmy's associates Jeremiah (Clifton Powell) and Shotgun (Ronald Selmour) as well as his lover Pearl (Pam Grier) to take turns stabbing him to death. Afterward, Bones' elegant brownstone building becomes his own tomb and is closed. The timeline flashes forward to 2001, where the neighborhood has become rundown and Jimmy's brownstone building is a condemned ruin. Four teens, Patrick (Khalil Kain), his brother Bill (Merwin Mondesir), their white step-sister Tia (Katharine Isabelle) and their best friend Maurice (Sean Amsing), buy the property and they want to renovate it as a nightclub. In the process, Tia finds a black dog who is actually the spiritual manifestation of Jimmy's tortured spirit. As the dog starts to eat, Jimmy is slowly resurrected. Patrick meets Pearl and her daughter Cynthia (Bianca Lawson), whom Patrick develops a romance with. Patrick wanted to open a nightclub at the old rundown neighborhood in hopes of making the neighborhood great again, and also to make a profit. While exploring the basement, Patrick, Cynthia, Bill, Tia, and Maurice find Jimmy Bones' body and they realize that he was actually murdered. The five decide to keep Jimmy's murder quiet or they won't be able to open the nightclub and they bury the remains. Later Jeremiah, who is Patrick and Bill's father as well as Tia's stepfather, finds out about Patrick and the gang's plan to open the club at Bones' old building. He freaks out and demands that Patrick and the others leave the building. Patrick, Bill, and Tia refuse his request and open the nightclub, in spite of their father's objections. On opening night Maurice is lured into an upstairs room where he is mauled to death by the spiritual black dog. Once he is fully resurrected, Jimmy sets the club on fire and is intent on getting revenge on those responsible for his death, those who betrayed him, and anyone who gets in his way. Pearl's neighbor Shotgun tells her how they should have burned the building down a long time ago. After the incident, Pearl admits to Cynthia that Jimmy Bones is her father, as she had a relationship with him. Jimmy first confronts Shotgun and kills him as a way to release him of the troubled guilt he tried to maintain by becoming an alcoholic. Patrick confronts his father Jeremiah and demands to know if he helped murder Jimmy Bones twenty-two years earlier. His father admits he betrayed Jimmy Bones to make money to leave the neighborhood. Also, he got fed up living in Bones' shadow and he wanted to be as popular and successful as him. Jeremiah allowed drugs into the neighborhood as long he got paid for it. Later, Jimmy confronts Eddie Mack in his home, and Eddie tries to shoot Jimmy, but the bullets pass through him. Jimmy pins Eddie to the wall with glass shards, decapitates him, later doing the same to Lupovich, but keeps their heads alive to transport their souls. Pearl, knowing that Jeremiah is next, goes with Cynthia to his house to rescue him. They end up being too late. Pearl, Cynthia, Patrick, Bill, Tia and Jeremiah's wife Nancy (Lynda Boyd) watch him get dragged off by Jimmy, leaving nothing but a melted hole in the window. Jimmy brings Jeremiah back to the building, along with the heads of Lupovich and Mack. Jimmy sends Lupovich and Mack to hell for all eternity while Jeremiah begs for his life. Patrick, Cynthia, Bill, and Pearl go underground to find that Jimmy Bones' body has disappeared. Pearl tells them that in order to put Jimmy to rest, they have to destroy the dress she wore the night Jimmy was murdered which was buried alongside him, as his blood which splattered onto it still contains his spirit and is the only thing keeping him anchored to the world of the living. As they look for Jimmy, Pearl steps in the elevator which closes and goes up. Meanwhile, Jeremiah asks Jimmy what he wants. He asks Jeremiah if he could give him his life back. When Jeremiah says he can't do that, Jimmy sends him to hell. Pearl gets off the elevator and walks into a room that is filled with ignited candles. She has a flashback and Jimmy appears and puts the bloody dress on her. Patrick, Cynthia, and Bill head to the second floor where they see a ghostly Maurice, who leads Bill in the wrong direction where he is captured and killed. Patrick tries to reach him but is too late. Patrick and Cynthia make their way to the room where Pearl and Jimmy are at; Patrick knows it's a trap. As Cynthia is lured to Pearl and Jimmy, Patrick hears his father's voice in a mirror begging for help. When Patrick hesitates, Jeremiah chokes him. Patrick uses his knife to chop Jeremiah's arm off and he disappears into hell. Patrick goes after Jimmy, who grabs Patrick by the throat as Cynthia begs him to let go. Pearl, realizing what is happening, tells Jimmy she loves him before grabbing a candle and setting herself and the dress on fire. As Jimmy and Pearl both die together, Patrick and Cynthia escape, barely making it out before the entire building collapses. Before jumping to safety, Cynthia is briefly pulled back into the building by an unseen force. Outside, Patrick finds an old picture of Jimmy and Pearl as Jimmy's face turns to him and says, \\"Dog eat dog, boy.\\" Too late, Patrick realizes that Cynthia has Jimmy's blood within her, and turns around as Cynthia, now possessed by Jimmy, smiles at him and vomits a mouthful of maggots into his face.

Reception Bones received generally negative reviews and has a 23% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 69 reviews with an average rating of 3.83 out of 10 with the consensus \\"Slow to start, the sleek looking Bones is more silly than scary. The film also has a score of 42 on Metacritic based on 21 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Spence D. of IGN commended Dickerson's direction and Snoop's performance but felt the film overall cribbed too heavily from A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Omen and the Amityville Horror films for a script that fails at social commentary and tonal consistency, concluding that \\"Injecting humor into a horror picture is one thing, but when the horror and the comedy become indistinguishable that's when you know you're in trouble.\\" Mike Clark of USA Today felt that Dickerson's talents were wasted in directing this \\"wannabe chiller\\" and was only brought in to fulfill a studio mandate for Halloween, concluding that, \\"[I]f grossness gives you the giggles, at least a couple of the movie's effects indeed put a little \\"wow\\" in this cinematic bowwow.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle criticized the film for being \\"ill conceived\\" with its plot structure and not focusing more on Snoop's character and his revenge tale. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the movie a \\"B\\" grade, saying it \\"may be pure trash, but it's trash made with the kind of oozy psychedelic zest\\" found in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised Snoop's portrayal of the title character, saying he's \\"ultimately scarier than most conventional Hollywood monsters\\", and Dickerson for infusing the film with \\"a special glee and an unusual density of scary imagery.\\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine noted how the film's cinematography and horror images borrowed elements from Dario Argento's Suspiria, concluding that \\"[T]he film's decapitated-head-aplenty finale is ludicrously overwrought, but who cares when a socially conscious horror flick gives death such a fabulous mac daddy face?\\" The Austin Chronicles Marc Savlov gave praise to Snoop as the titular character for showcasing his potential as an actor and Dickerson for utilizing horror tropes to great effect, saying \\"If you can put aside your love of logic and sense and just go with the spookshow flow of Dickerson's funky little flick, you'll love it.\\" The film opened at number 10 at the U.S. box office, earning $2,823,548 in 847 theaters its opening weekend averaging $3,333 per theater. It ended up earning $7,316,658 domestically and $1,062,195 internationally for a total of $8,378,853, falling short of its $16 million budget. See also *J.

Besides his lengthy career as a studio musician and touring drummer, he has been a member of the band Squeeze during the 1990s and as a member of the supergroup Works Progress Administration during the early 2000s. Tom Waits has referred to him as \\"one of the best rock drummers alive\\". Career Thomas states his favourite album and greatest influence is Are You Experienced by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. He first heard the album at the age of 14, and became greatly influenced by Jimi Hendrix Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell. Thomas met his drumming hero as a teenager, after waiting outside Mitchell's house for multiple days. Following early work with Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers and John Stewart, Thomas was recruited as a member of Costello's backing band the Attractions in 1977. Elvis Costello & the Attractions would spend the next decade touring the world, and recording nine albums, from This Year's Model (1978) to Blood and Chocolate (1986). Although Costello split with the Attractions between 1987 and 1993, he continued to work regularly with Thomas during this period. Thomas played drums on the albums Spike (1989), Mighty Like a Rose (1991), and Kojak Variety (recorded in 1990 but not released until 1995) and was a member of Costello's 1989‚Äì1991 touring band, The Rude 5. Costello reunited with the Attractions for the albums Brutal Youth (1994) and All This Useless Beauty (1996). In 2001, Costello recruited Thomas, Faragher, and fellow Attraction Steve Nieve to record the album that became When I Was Cruel (2002). Elvis Costello & the Imposters, as they were subsequently named, have gone on to tour extensively, and recorded the album The Delivery Man (2004). From 2008 until 2010, Thomas was a member of the house band for Costello's television program Spectacle: Elvis Costello with... Thomas lives in Los Angeles, with his wife Judy. Their daughter Tennessee is drummer for the band the Like. In 2003, Thomas was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Elvis Costello & the Attractions. In Summer, 2015, Thomas hit the road as drummer for the summer tour of the folk-pop duo, The Weepies. Studio work Over the years Thomas has been an in-demand session musician. Among his many credits include, drums for Graham Parker's 1991 album Struck By Lightning and 1992 album Burning Questions. After Costello split with the Attractions for a second time, Thomas worked for the next few years primarily as a session drummer, recording with such artists as Suzanne Vega, Neil Finn, Richard Thompson, Vonda Shepard, Mikel Erentxun, Sheryl Crow, Fito P√°ez, Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Los Lobos, Wild Colonials, Matt Brown of 3 lb. Thrill, Wendy James, Tasmin Archer and John Paul Jones. In 1993, Thomas joined the band Squeeze for their album Some Fantastic Place replacing Gilson Lavis on drums, and for the tour in support of it. In 1994, Thomas was part of a trio that included vocalist/avant garde opera diva, Diamanda Gal√°s, and former Led Zeppelin bassist/multi-instrumentalist John Paul Jones, who recorded the album, The Sporting Life. He also played on the Elliott Smith album, Figure 8 (DreamWorks) (2000) on the songs \\"Junk Bond Trader\\", \\"Wouldn't Mama Be Proud?\\" and \\"Can't Make a Sound\\". Thomas currently plays local Los Angeles gigs with bassist Davey Faragher and guitarist Val McCallum, under the band name, Jackshit. In 2006, Thomas played drums on the album Doomed to Make Choices by Jason Karaban. He also plays drums on Karaban's album Sobriety Kills (2009) and Karaban's single \\"Succeed 101\\" (2009).

It formerly connected Minnesota State Highway 36 and Wisconsin Highway 64. Around 18,000 vehicles crossed the bridge daily.Giles, Kevin (July 9, 2008) \\"Tuesday: Still overworked in Stillwater\\" Star Tribune The new St. Croix Crossing bridge crossing the St. Croix river valley to the south of Stillwater replaced its purpose, having opened to highway traffic on August 2, 2017, leaving the Stillwater Lift Bridge to be preserved and to be converted to bicycle/pedestrian use.http://www.dot.state.mn.us/stcroixcrossing/index.html The bridge in 2013 with its lift span raised The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for having state-level significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated for being a rare surviving example of a vertical-lift highway bridge based on the designs pioneered by Waddell & Harrington. The Stillwater Lift Bridge was one of two bridges on the St. Croix River between the Interstate 94 bridge in Hudson, Wisconsin, and the U.S. Highway 8 bridge in Taylors Falls, Minnesota, providing a popular and useful alternative to those crossings. (The other bridge is the Highway 243 bridge at Osceola, Wisconsin.) The bridge consists of seven fixed steel truss spans long in total, including a vertically lifting span long. It is wide, allowing one lane of traffic in each direction. The lifting span is a Waddell & Harrington type, one of six built in Minnesota and Wisconsin and one of three still remaining today. Built in 1931 to replace a swing bridge from 1910, it was the last bridge of this design to be built in the area. Minnesota and Wisconsin evenly split the $460,174 cost of the bridge. History Roadway view of the bridge from the west Beginning August 1, 2005, the Minnesota Department of Transportation closed the bridge to perform substantial repairs at a cost of $5 million provided by Congress. The project included renovating the tender's house so that it would conform to modern safety standards while maintaining historical preservation. On November 11, 2005, the bridge re-opened to traffic after the bridge deck had been replaced. In July 2008 a truck carrying lumber exceeded the height clearance of the bridge and struck its structure as it tried to cross. The bridge had to be closed for repairs, and reopened on August 2, 2008. In 2012 the bridge was closed again for a construction project to make more steel repairs. The St. Croix River Crossing Project of MnDOT called for the construction of a brand new, four-lane bridge less than a mile downriver and the conversion of the Stillwater Bridge to pedestrian and bicycle use. Originally, construction of this bridge was planned to start in 2024, but legislation was passed requiring the Department of Transportation to address aging bridges by 2018, and the start date was moved up to 2013. However, on March 11, 2010, a federal judge ruled that the government had violated its rules in approving the bridge design, which sent the process back to an earlier stage. In 2009 Minneapolis architectural model builder Feyereisen Studios completed a model of the Stillwater Lift Bridge. The idea to build a physical model of the Stillwater Lift Bridge was undertaken in an effort to enlist the assistance of the disabled community, so as to make it easier for everyone to visualize and clearly understand the project. Unlike most architectural models, the model of the Stillwater Lift Bridge was designed so that the visually impaired could explore it by sense of touch. The architectural model builders enlisted the help of the visually impaired while creating the model, and utilized various unconventional materials, including magnets to make breakaway lamp posts, sandpaper to indicate detectable warnings, raised crosswalk markings to indicate the crosswalk, and fuzzy grass. Everything on the model was labeled with both large text and Braille to enable people with low vision to understand the plans for the bridge.Wowza, Inc. Shortcomings Bridge sections under renovation in 2018 Because the bridge feeds directly into downtown Stillwater on the Minnesota side, gridlock often occurred and traffic could back up on Minnesota State Highway 36 for many miles, especially on weekends and during the summer. The effect was made worse whenever the bridge was raised. The bridge's mechanisms had remained essentially unaltered since its opening in 1931 and on occasion became stuck. In addition, the bridge had been deemed \\"structurally deficient\\" by inspectors, receiving a sufficiency rating of 32.8 on a 100-point scale, as of June 23, 2008. Because of the bridge's design, it was considered \\"fracture critical\\"; there was no built-in redundancy to prevent the entire structure from collapsing if one component fails. In comparison, the I-35W Mississippi River bridge, another fracture-critical bridge that collapsed on August 1, 2007, received a sufficiency rating of 50. The bridge had a height restriction of and a weight restriction of 40 tons.

It is found from Colombia, Venezuela and Trinidad south to Bolivia and northern Argentina. This manakin is found in forests, secondary growth and plantations. It is a small, plump bird about long. Males have a black crown, upper back, wings and tail and are otherwise white. Females are olive-green and resemble female golden-headed manakins. At breeding time, males are involved in lekking behaviour on the forest floor during which they puff out their neck feathers. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Like other manakins, the white-bearded manakin is a compact, brightly coloured forest bird, typically long and weighing . The adult male has a black crown, upper back, wings and tail, and the plumage is otherwise white. He has orange legs. The female and young males are olive-green and resemble female golden-headed manakins, but they have orange legs. The race endemic to Trinidad, M. m. trinitatis is larger than mainland birds, and the female has yellower underparts. Apart from the buzzing display song, the white-bearded manakin has a number of other calls, including a trilled musical peeerr. Ecology Female on nest in Brazil These manakins eat fruit and some insects. The male white-bearded manakin has a fascinating breeding display at a communal lek. Each male clears a patch of forest floor to bare earth, and perches on a bare stick. The display consists of rapid leaps between sticks and the ground, accompanied by a loud wing snap, the whirring of the wings, and a chee-poo call. Groups of up to 70 birds may perform together, the largest leks being in Trinidad. The female builds a shallow cup nest low in a tree; two brown-mottled white eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 18‚Äì19 days, with a further 13‚Äì15 days to fledging. The young are fed mainly on regurgitated fruit with some insects. Distribution In South America, two thirds of white-bearded manakin's range is in the combined Amazon Basin, the Guianas, and the Orinoco River drainage of Venezuela; also eastern Colombia. Three disjunct populations occur: Pacific coastal Ecuador, with southwestern Colombia; coastal and inland western Venezuela with northwestern Colombia; and the largest, southeastern Brazil, with inland regions bordering Paraguay in the south, and from Paran√° state to coastal Pernambuco in the northeast. Only one area of the Amazon Basin does not have the species, the 2200 km Purus River region in southwestern Amazonas state. Status This bird has a very wide range, is fairly common and is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Due to its rarity, the album is less popular amongst Self fans than Subliminal Plastic Motives, but critical reception remained positive. Mahaffey recorded the album at his house in Murfreesboro as a treat for fans clamoring for a new Self release. The song \\"KidDies\\" became a minor hit (receiving heavy rotation at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles), in part due to its amusing lyrics which poke fun at Marilyn Manson. With its Halloween theme, it still receives some scattered radio play nationally, particularly during October. The songs \\"Dielya Downtown\\" and \\"Microchip Girl\\" also became favorites of Self fans with the former becoming a live staple of the band.

A small pack of coyotes in Yellowstone National Park A hunting pack of African wild dogs Pack size distribution of the African wild dog. Pack is a social group of conspecific canines. Not all species of canids form packs; for example, small canids like the red fox do not. Pack size and social behaviour within packs varies across species. Pack behavior in specific species African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) live and hunt in packs. Males assist in raising the pups, and remain with their pack for life, while the females leave their birth pack at about the age of two and a half years old to join a pack with no females. Males outnumber the females in a pack, and usually only one female breeds with all of the males. African wild dogs are not territorial, and they hunt cooperatively in their packs, running down large game and tearing it apart. They cooperate in caring for wounded and sick pack members as well as the young. Gray wolves (Canis lupus) usually live in packs which consist of the adult parents and their offspring of perhaps the last 2 or 3 years. The adult parents are usually unrelated and other unrelated wolves may sometimes join the pack. Wolves usually hunt in packs, but they hunt alone in spring and summer months when there is plenty of prey available. They are found in both Eurasia and North America. Black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) in Southern and Eastern Africa and coyotes (Canis latrans) in North America have a single long-term mate, but usually hunt alone or in pairs. Both parents care for the young, and the parents and their current offspring are the pack. They occasionally cooperate in larger packs to hunt large game. The Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) pack members hunt for rodents alone and come together mainly to defend their territory from rival packs. Corsac foxes sometimes form packs, unlike some other fox species.

Genetic variability can become limited within such an interrelated group, and so conditions for gene flow must exist. Outside wolves can provide these opportunities. A pack may be accepting of another wolf into their group if it is a distant relative, if reproduction rates are low due to loss or infertility of an alpha, or if their numbers are significantly reduced. Characterization of wolves into dominance hierarchies of alpha, beta, and omega were based on behavioral studies of unrelated wolves in captivity, and this assemblage largely does not apply to natural wolf packs, which are familial units. = The lone wolf = These singular outside wolves, often referred to as lone wolves, are vulnerable to food scarcity and territorial attacks, and generally make up less than 15% of a wolf population. Lone wolves usually result from sexually mature offspring leaving their parental pack, though may also occur if harassed subordinates chose to disperse. In times of prey scarcity, low ranking wolves may choose to go off on their own if the pack cannot supply sufficient food. These lone wolves may then attempt to join into an existing wolf pack or, more commonly, find a mate and begin a new pack family as the alphas. = The alphas (breeding pair) = Within the wolf pack, the alphas, now more commonly referred to as the breeding pair, are the only wolves in the group which breed and produce offspring; they are the matriarch and patriarch of the family. It was previously believed to be common for an aging or sick alpha to be replaced by one of their offspring, but more recent studies have shown this incestuous behavior to be very rare. = The pups = Importance of the alpha is rivaled only by that of the pups.1\\\\. Ellis, S., & Junor, P. (2009). The Man Who Lives With Wolves (1st ed.,). New York, NY: Harmony Books. The fundamental purpose of the pack is the successful production of offspring, and so raising of the litter is a collaborative venture ‚Äì all members contribute to their development. In times of scarcity, the breeding pair will often prioritize care of the pups, and preferentially feed the youngest wolves first. Despite this committed involvement, pup mortality is high, with researchers citing that only roughly 30% survive their first year of life.1\\\\. Smith, D. (2015, March 5). Wolf pup survival a fragile thing. StarTribune. Retrieved March 27, 2019, from http://www.startribune.com/wolf-pup-survival-a-fragile- thing/295226071/ Those who survive, however, grow up with the added advantage of being surrounded by numerous care-takers and teachers. There exists a culture within wolf packs, and this is passed on to the offspring by the elders of the group. Pups learn something from each member of the pack, and attain the vital social skills required to create those powerful bonds upon which wolf societal structure relies. White huskies dog sledding Dominance and the alpha wolf Animals which typically predominate over others are associated with the term alpha. Among pack-living wolves, alpha wolves are the genetic parents of most cubs in the pack. Such access to mating females creates strong selective pressure for intra-sex competition. Wolves show deference to the alpha pair in their pack by allowing them to allocate the distribution of food, typically preferentially feeding the youngest wolves. Wolves use eye contact and posture as an indicator of dominance or submission, which are largely age-based; these postures are rare except in relation to food, as described previously. The smaller and more nuclear a pack is, the status of alpha is less likely to be obtained through fighting, and young wolves instead leave the pack to find a mate and produce offspring of their own.Mech, L. David. 1999. Larger or less-nuclear packs may operate differently and possess more complex and flexible social structures.Dutcher, Jim and Jamie. Wolves At Our Door, Simon and Schuster, 2002 In the case of other wild canids, the alpha male may not have exclusive access to the alpha female;Gary Greenberg and Maury M. Haraway. 1998 moreover, other pack members may guard the maternity den used by the alpha female; as with the African wild dog, Lycaon pictus.C. Michael Hogan. 2009 As dominant roles may be deemed normal among social species with extended parenting, it has been suggested that the additional term alpha is not required merely to describe dominance due to its ubiquity, but should be reserved for where they are the predominant pack progenitor. For instance, wolf biologist L. David Mech stated > \\"calling a wolf an alpha is usually no more appropriate than referring to a > human parent or a doe deer as an alpha. Any parent is dominant to its young > offspring, so alpha adds no information. Why not refer to an alpha female as > the female parent, the breeding female, the matriarch, or simply the mother? > Such a designation emphasizes not the animal's dominant status, which is > trivial information, but its role as pack progenitor, which is critical > information. The one use we may still want to reserve for alpha is in the > relatively few large wolf packs multiple litters. ... In such cases the > older breeders are probably dominant to the younger breeders and perhaps can > more appropriately be called the alphas. ... The point here is not so much > the terminology but what the terminology falsely implies: a rigid, force- > based dominance hierarchy.\\" = Use in dog training = One of the most persistent theories in dog training literature is the idea of the alpha wolf, an individual gray wolf who uses body language and, when needed, physical force to maintain its dominance within the wolf pack. The idea was first reported in early wolf research. It was subsequently adopted by dog trainers. The term alpha was popularized as early as 1976 in the dog training book How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend (Monks of New Skete), which introduced the idea of the alpha roll, a technique for punishing unwanted dog behaviours. Psychologist and dog trainer Stanley Coren in the 2001 book How to Speak Dog says \\"you are the alpha dog...You must communicate that you are the pack leader and dominant\\". Training techniques assumed to be wolf pack related such as scruff shaking, the alpha roll and recommendations to be alpha to the dog continue to be used and recommended by some dog training instructors. It has been suggested that the use of such techniques may have more to do with human psychology than with dog behaviour; \\"dominance hierarchies and dominance disputes and testing are a fundamental characteristic of all social groups... But perhaps only we humans learn to use punishment primarily to gain for ourselves the reward of being dominant. Most leading veterinary and animal behavior associations, and most contemporary trainers would agree, advocating the use of rewards to teach commands and encourage good communication between owners and their pets. Modern best practices dictate an abandonment of outdated \\"pack\\" methods. Some canine behaviourists suggest that kind, efficient training uses games to teach commands which can be utilised to benefit the owner's everyday life.

He was a Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford (1978‚Äì2005) and head of the organic chemistry at Oxford. Education  Baldwin was the second son of Frederick C N Baldwin and Olive F Headland. He was educated at Brighton Grammar School and Lewes County Grammar School. He attended Imperial College, London (BSc, DIC, PhD). He received his Ph.D. working under the direction of Sir Derek H.R. Barton, FRS, Nobel Laureate, who described him as his best student. Career and Research  After four years on the staff at Imperial College, Baldwin moved to the United States: first to Pennsylvania State University in 1967 and then to MIT in 1970, where he published his most significant work ‚Äî Baldwin's rules for ring closure reactions. It was also where Baldwin met his future wife, Christine Louise Franchi; they married in 1977. In 1978, he moved to Oxford to become head of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, where he upgraded its facilities and revolutionised the type of work done, while building links between Organic Chemistry and basic biological research. The laboratory formally closed in 2003, but his group moved to the new research facility, the Chemistry Research Laboratory on Mansfield Road. One of Baldwin's passions was finding out how nature makes chemicals that researchers cannot. This led him to ‚Äòbiomimetic‚Äô synthesis: using the principles of nature to improve the generation of biomolecules in the laboratory. The Baldwin group‚Äôs range of interests includes mechanisms of reactions; total synthesis of natural products such as trichoviridin, acromelic acid A, hypoglycin A and lactacystin; and biomimetic synthesis of natural products such as (-)-xestospongin A. Baldwin published over 700 papers. Georgina Ferry's obituary of Baldwin notes that \\"he had little time for the academic conventions of Oxford: he spoke his mind.\\" and that \\"he enjoyed good food, fine wine, powerful motorbikes, fast cars and his dogs.\\" Some of these aspcts of his character are illustrated in a three-part documentary.See Parts I (first 1:50 min.) and III (all) =Some positions held= Derived from Who‚Äôs Who 2020. *1963 Assistant Lecturer in Chemistry, Imperial College *1966 Lecturer *1967 Assistant Professor of Chemistry, Penn State *1969 Associate Professor *1969-70 Alfred P.

It is a small mannakin, about long. Males are entirely black apart from a golden head, yellow bill, white and red thighs and pink legs. Females and juveniles are olive-green with pink legs. At breeding time, males are involved in a cooperative lekking behaviour during which they jump, slide and dart from perch to perch. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Adult male Like other manakins, the golden-headed manakin is a compact, brightly coloured forest bird, typically 3.7 in (9.4 cm) long and weighing 0.44 oz (12.5 g). The adult male is black apart from a golden cap, white and red thighs, pink legs and a yellowish bill. The female and young males are olive-green and resemble female white-bearded manakins, but are smaller, shorter-tailed and have pinkish (not bright orange) legs. Apart from the buzzing display song (see below), the golden-headed manakin has a number of other calls, including a buzzing pir pir prrrrrt. Distribution and habitat This manakin is found from Panama, Colombia and Trinidad south and east to the Guianas and Brazil and northern Peru. It is not found south of the Amazon or the Ucayali Rivers. It is a common bird of forests, second growth and plantations. Their upper altitudinal limit is usually about 3,600 ft (1,100 m), but they are occasionally found has high as c.5,000 ft (1,500 m) ASL.Salaman et al. (2002) Like other manakins they eat fruit and some insects. Ecology Male golden-headed manakins give a fascinating courtship display at a communal lek. Each male occupies a horizontal perch 20‚Äì40 ft (6‚Äì12 m) high and rapidly jumps, slides, or darts to other perches. The display is accompanied by the whirring of the wings and a buzzing zit-zit call. Groups of up to 12 birds may perform together. The female builds a shallow cup nest low in a tree; two brown-mottled yellowish eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 16‚Äì17 days. This bird has a large range and is thus considered a species of Least Concern by the IUCN.BLI (2004, 2007) Footnotes  References  * * BirdLife International (BLI) (2007): Golden-headed Manakin Species Factsheet.

Robinson High School, often referred to as Robinson, JMR, or JRob by students, is a comprehensive public high school located in Concord, North Carolina. It is the fifth high school of the Cabarrus County Schools system, opening its doors in August 2001, the county's first new high school since 1966. The school's enrollment dropped with the openings of Cox Mill High School and Hickory Ridge High School. The school was constructed under the name Southwest Cabarrus High School, but was renamed in 2001 after the death of Jay Robinson, Chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Education and former Cabarrus County Schools administrator. Campus and Facilities Robinson sits in the southwest sector of Cabarrus County, one mile (1.6 km) northeast of Charlotte Motor Speedway. Designed by Yates-Chreitzberg-Hughes Architects, the single-floor school is constructed around two central courtyards that can only be accessed from the interior of the school. At over , it is the largest school building in the county and one of the largest public buildings in the county. Robinson is locally characteristic for its distinctive architecture, wide hallways, and massive commons areas near the front of the school. David S. Wright Auditorium, named for Robinson's first principal, hosts numerous functions throughout the year including concerts by high school and college groups and assemblies for community groups such as Elevation Church. Due to its large size, the school system often uses it for meetings for large numbers of staff members. Athletic facilities located on the campus include Bulldog Stadium (football, soccer, and athletics) and a fieldhouse, a gymnasium (basketball, volleyball, wrestling) and adjoining practice gymnasium, tennis courts, and a baseball/softball complex. Academics Jay M. Robinson High School campus from the southeast Robinson offers a full range of classes in all subjects required under the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (DPI). Advanced Placement courses are offered in U.S. History, World History, European History, American Government and Politics, Calculus AB and BC, Statistics, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Physics, Psychology, Music Theory, Studio Art, Spanish, English Grammar and Composition, and English Literature. Many online classes for college credit are provided by Rowan-Cabarrus Community College. In 2006 Robinson added an on-campus AFJROTC program, which has become one of the best in the county, it only having lost the in-county competition between the AFJROTC units twice. Students at Hickory Ridge and Concord High Schools are involved in the Robinson AFJROTC program as well. The school also hosts broadcasting classes, with a 6-minute show airing each day. The marching band, named \\"The Pride of Robinson\\", is one of the most successful marching bands in the state of North Carolina, winning over 30 awards in 2006. Blair Smith (2001-2016) was the Director of the Bands of Robinson since the school opened, he soon retired after the 2016 school year. Andrew Carter is the newest director of bands for the band. Robinson also offers the following Career Technical Education program areas: Personal Finance, Marketing, Sports & Entertainment Marketing, Health Sciences, Teen Living, Family & Consumer Sciences, Drafting, Automotive Service Technology, Furniture & Cabinetmaking, Masonry, Robotics, Electrical Trades, and Technology. Many of the CTE teachers bring 'real world' experience to the classroom. Within the CTE department is the JMRHS Academy of Engineering and Automation which opened to incoming freshmen in fall 2015. Robinson was recognized by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction as a \\"School of Distinction\\" under the state's ABC standards for public education for the 2005-06 school year. Its high school newspaper is the Paw Print, which is a member of the High School National Ad Network. =Academic Clubs= Robinson offers a wide range of academics-related extracurricular activities, with clubs for nearly every academic department. The Beta Club serves as the school's honors society. In academic competition, Robinson's Quiz Bowl team has consistently been among North Carolina's top teams in the past several years and participated in the PACE National Scholastics Championship in June 2007 at the University of Michigan. The school also hosts a small number of other extracurricular clubs such as The Junior Engineering Technological Society (JETS). Athletics Robinson's athletic teams are known as the \\"Bulldogs\\". The school is a member of the 3A division of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association and competes in the South Piedmont Conference with several other public high schools in Mecklenburg and Cabarrus County. The school sponsors interscholastic football, cross country (boys and girls), volleyball, basketball (boys and girls), wrestling, swimming (boys and girls), soccer (boys and girls), tennis (boys and girls), track and field (boys and girls), golf, baseball, and softball. From 2005 to 2009 and 2012 to 2015, Robinson competed in the 4A classification of the NCHSAA, in the MeCKa Conference. Currently, the school is in the South Piedmont Conference, with other schools in Cabarrus County. Robinson has several local rivals, but the three largest are with Hickory Ridge, Northwest Cabarrus and Central Cabarrus, the three schools that contributed a vast majority of the students. It also has a growing rivalry against Cox Mill. In 2007 Robinson won its first state championship, when senior Jake Wainwright finished first in the high jump at the NCHSAA 4A Track and Field championships. In 2008 sophomore Dominic Parisi went undefeated in the 112-pound weight class to win the NCHSAA 4A Wrestling championship. In the 2009-2010 season Robinson also won a state championship in wrestling for both the dual team tournament and the individual tournament, for Robinson's first-ever team state championship. Parisi and Garrison White won first in the state for their respective weight classes. The 2015-2016 varsity boys basketball team earned both the South Piedmont Conference regular-season championship as well as the conference tournament. Weeks later, the Bulldogs won the NCHSAA 3A State Championship on March 12, 2016 at Carmichael Arena against the defending champion Terry Sanford 59-55\\\\. Junior Lavar Batts Jr. (now point guard at NC State) was named the most outstanding player of the western region, while senior Daniel Spencer (now shooting guard at Belmont Abbey College) was named the game's MVP. On November 4, 2016 the varsity football team defeated Concord High School to claim the South Piedmont Conference Championship, finishing 8-1 in the conference and 9-2 overall. On October 27, 2017 the varsity football team defeated Kannapolis to become back- to-back South Piedmont Conference Champions, finishing 5-0 in the conference and 9-2 overall.

He is regarded by Bah√° º√≠s as part of their own religious history, and is highly featured in the two primary Bah√° º√≠ historical books of God Passes By and The Dawn-breakers.  Background  Mull√° Mu·∏•ammad- ªAliy-i-Zanj√°n√≠ was the son of √Åkh√∫nd Mull√°  ªAbdu'r-Ra·∏•√≠m, a respected early nineteenth century mulla from Zanjan. As a boy, Mu·∏•ammad- ªAl√≠ showed promise, such that his father sent him to the shiite shrine-cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq, where he studied under the prominent Shar√≠fu'l-'Ulam√° M√°zandar√°n√≠. With the death of his teacher and the closing of the seminaries during the epidemic of 1831, he returned to Iran, settling in Hamadan. When his father died, a delegation came from Zanjan and asked him to assume his father's position. He returned to Zanjan and took up the position, teaching in his father's mosque. After his return to Zanjan, Mull√° Mu·∏•ammad- ªAl√≠ was given the title ·∏§ujjatu'l-Isl√°m (lit. 'Proof of Islam'), which was a common title for distinguished 'ulam√°' at the time, and was known as ·∏§ujjat-i-Zanj√°n√≠. An eloquent and fiery speaker, he quickly acquired a large following, which excited rivalry with the other 'ulam√°' of the city. The main contention, however, was with his religious views as he was, like his father, an Akhbar√≠. The Akhbar√≠s, who had a greater reliance on the traditions of the Imams, were opposed by the Us√∫l√≠s, who relied on rationalism and ijtih√°d (Islamic rulings based on the judgement of the clerics). ·∏§ujjat denied the authority of the mujtahids (Us√∫l√≠ clerics who could issue rulings based on ijtih√°d), denounced his fellow 'ulam√°', issued legal rulings sharply at variance with their own and imposed supererogatory observances on his followers. One example of his variance in rulings concerns the concept of ritual purity. He held that one was not impurified by contact with Christians and Jews during the rain, whereas Us√∫l√≠s held that non-Muslims were inherently impure and could contaminate believers through contact. He also held that the Imams and Prophets had physical bodies which were not in any way miraculous.  Conversion  When ·∏§ujjat first heard of the B√°b√≠ movement, he dispatched a messenger named Mull√° Iskandar to investigate. The messenger returned bearing a letter from the B√°b. ·∏§ujjat was preparing to deliver a lesson in the mosque after congregational prayers. When ·∏§ujjat perused the letter, he became visibly agitated, took off his turban (the symbol of his religious authority) and put on a lambskin hat (the symbol of the laity). He is reported to have told some of his followers openly: \\"The author of these verses claims to be the Bab, as 'I am the City of Knowledge, and  ªAli is its Gate.'\\"  See also  *Hujja *Hujjah  References  Category:B√°b√≠s Category:People from Zanjan, Iran Category:1812 births Category:1851 deaths ","title":"Hujjat"},{"id":"2352636","text":"Oberrad is a city district of Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Established in 1922 as a preparatory feeder school for the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, the school now caters for approximately 700 students from Pre-school to Year 12. Arden's first Year 12 class commenced in 2008. It used to be an only girls school in 1923 but 10 years later added the first ever boy and now it is a boys and girls school. Arden Anglican College is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHAA) and Junior School Heads Association of Australia, the Association of Independent Co-Educational Schools, and the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales. History Began as a preparatory school of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney (PLC Sydney). The idea of a PLC Sydney preparatory school on the northern railway line, had first been suggested , however nothing came of these ideas then. On 23 February 1922, the PLC Council received a request from the Beecroft Presbyterian Congregation, that a primary school be established at Cheltenham. Subsequently, a sub- committee of the Council was formed to investigate its viability, and inspect a number of sites in Beecroft and Pennant Hills. Arden has been recently recognised as a leading sports school in the Hillzone sports for 2012. Council gave the committee power to open a preparatory school in the Beecroft Church Hall, to appoint a teacher-in-charge and to make any other arrangements necessary. By the April 1922 Council meeting, it was reported that the school had been opened at Beecroft with 13 female pupils, and with Eleanor Linck in charge. This school was named the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Beecroft and was to serve as an all-girls, primary feeder school for the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon. Over the next few years enrolments grew and an assistant teacher was appointed. However, PLC Beecroft was not a financial success and Council enthusiasm began to wane. Linck tried her best to expand the school, suggesting that \\"Romana House\\" on Beecroft Road be purchased to allow for further enrolments, and that the house next door to the Church Hall be purchased so that boarders could be accommodated. Despite the school's strong number of enrolment application's, these requests were all declined. In 1925, an additional teacher was appointed to teach kindergarten and sport. It was reported that the local community was taking an interest in the new PLC, as that year two prizes had been presented to the school by the Beecroft School of Arts for library proficiency, and the Beecroft Presbyterian Women's Guild presented a prize for Scripture. In 1926, Mrs Linck resigned to take up a position at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne, and Mrs Lucy I. Ritter was appointed head. Later that year, two council members suggested that a house be purchased to expand the school and widen its tuition scope, however again nothing came of this. Council now appeared to be uninterested in the Beecroft school. Ritter, in the Assembly report for 1927, complained that \\"Beecroft deserves more support from Presbyterians on the Hornsby line.\\" The school continued to make losses and so on 19 June 1929, Council decided that it was to be closed. Ritter, and the assistant teacher Ms Gurney, resigned in December of that year. In 1930, Gurney reopened the school in the Church Hall, which she named \\"Arden\\" after the Shakespearean Forest of Peace in As You Like It. The school flourished under her leadership. Arden came under the control of the Anglican Diocesan Schools in 1946, and subsequently moved to St John's Beecroft Church Hall where it was named Arden Anglican College. The college moved again in 1952 to a house in Wongala Crescent, and in 1962, property was purchased on Beecroft Road. In 2000, due to demand from the local community, preliminary plans for a secondary school at Arden began. The school purchased the former site of the Australian American International School at Oxford Street, Epping in 2001, and in 2003, the first year 7 class commenced at the new senior campus. Yearly expansion has continued since then, and concluded with the first Year 12 class graduating in 2008. 2008 also saw the opening of the Senior Studies Centre. Located directly opposite the secondary campus, it facilitates learning for year 11 and 12 (Preliminary and HSC) students in a \\"corporate-style\\" environment. In 2017, Arden announced a planned $21 million redevelopment of its Epping campus.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-district- times/arden-anglican-school-plans-epping-secondary-campus-project/news- story/75a1368875c33b735e24cb2c1018efda In 2018, the Principal Graham Anderson signed a petition with the Anglican Diocese of Sydney to retain s 38(3) in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984(Cth) which allows private religious schools to discriminate against staff and students based on sexual orientation. In the petition it was argued that 'a more general right' to religious freedom should exist, and the existing statutory 'exemptions should remain'. In 2017, Arden announced a $21 million redevelopment of its Secondary Campus in Epping, to be finished in early 2020, in what would become known as 'Essex'. The new building accommodates: * New Administration * Student Services * New Science Laboratories * New Food Technology Kitchen * Hammond Resource Centre (Library) * Multiple TAS Workshops * Multiple General Classrooms * The Arden Creative Arts Centre (TACAC) * Rooftop Terrace * Underground car/motorcycle/bicycle parking space * Twin outdoor multi-sport courts * Two levels connect with the existing building, refurbished  Motto  The motto of Arden is 'In God My Joy'. The school encourages the students to show others the joy to be found by learning to put Jesus first in your life, to then consider the needs of others, as well as reflecting on developing yourself with God's guidance. It stresses upon putting Jesus first, others second, yourself third; and to wrestle at all times with Jesus' fabulous parable of the Good Samaritan: to love your neighbour as yourself; to care for \\"The Other\\"; to be inclusive of the broken, because we are beloved by God. Governance Arden Anglican School is governed by the council. The Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney elects 10 persons for the council, along with the other persons appointed by the Archbishop. The role of the council is to serve the Arden community by ensuring long term planning is undertaken, appropriate policies are implemented and that finances are managed in a prudent manner. The council also appoints the Principal. The day-to-day operations of the School are managed by the Principal in which they also report to the council. Council meet on the first Wednesday of each month during term time and there are three committees of the council: * Finance * Governance * Property Development and Planning Campus Arden Anglican College is located on two campuses in the north-western suburbs of Sydney. The pre-school and primary School are situated in a bushland setting in Beecroft near Beecroft railway station on Wongala Crescent, while the secondary school is located from Epping railway station, in the suburb of Epping. Curriculum The primary school follows a curriculum mandated by the NSW Board of Studies, and where required is tailored to meet the needs of individual students. Specialist teachers are used for subjects such as Physical Education (PE), Music, Art, French language, Science, Library, Computer and Problem Solving. The secondary school also follows the Board of Studies curriculum. In 2008, the first year 12 class completed the NSW Higher School Certificate. Co-curriculum =Sport= Arden offers sport to all year levels, and students may partake in house and inter school competitions. Through Arden's membership of the Junior School Heads Association of Australia, Primary students may represent the school in sports such as athletics, swimming, cross-country, gymnastics, T-ball, softball, minkey (mini hockey), hockey, netball, basketball, rugby and women's soccer. Secondary students may represent Arden in cricket, basketball, soccer (indoor/outdoor), rugby, netball, athletics, cross-country, softball, hockey, in the HZSA (Hills Zone Sports Association). There are three houses Jenolan, Birnam and Sherwood. Every year there are various sporting events at the Beecroft campus including the swimming carnival, cross-country and athletics carnival.

The content and layout of the pattern was designed by engineer Finn Hendil (da; 1939‚Äì2011) in the Philips TV laboratory in Copenhagen under supervision of chief engineer Erik Helmer Nielsen in 1966‚Äì67. The equipment, the PM5544 Test Pattern Generator, which generates the pattern, was made by engineer Finn Hendil and his group in 1968‚Äì69. Since the introduction of the PM5544 in the early 1970s, the Philips Pattern has become one of the most commonly used test cards, with only the SMPTE bars, the BBC Test Card F and the Snell & Wilcox Zone Plate coming close to its usage. The Philips PM5544 pattern was later incorporated into other test pattern generators from Philips itself, as well as test pattern generators from various other manufacturers. The BBC occasionally used a slightly modified version called Test Card G from 1971 until the late-1990s, in conjunction with Test Card F. The IBA initially used this card in the 1970s, also in conjunction with Test Card F, but eventually abandoned Test Card G and developed a unique test card called the ETP-1, which was brought into use on ITV from 1979 onwards. Many broadcasters using a 625-line PAL system used some form of the Philips Pattern. Since the Philips PM5544 pattern is geared towards the PAL colour-coding system, this test pattern is uncommon among NTSC and SECAM broadcasters, though some, such as CBFT and CBMT in Canada, WBOY-TV and WNYW in the United States, DZBB-TV in the Philippines, Myawaddy TV in Myanmar, KBS and MBC in South Korea and TTV Main Channel, CTV Main Channel and CTS Main Channel in Taiwan have used a 525-line variant of it. The Japanese national broadcaster, NHK, also used a 525-line version of the test card, albeit with slight technical differences as compared to those used by the American and Canadian broadcasters so as to conform with the NTSC-J system. SECAM users of the Philips PM5544 test card included TF1, Antenne 2, FR3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcLrqSYYd6Y Canal+,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09U8Prm0-bM La Cinqui√®me and M6https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmyNIPEQrec in France, Iraqi TVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjfdehctV0s in Iraq and VTVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MNcEX2tJcM in Vietnam. The Philips PM5544 was also in widespread use in Australia for many years, most notably with the ABC and SBS. Some commercial stations also used it. In New Zealand, it was used by TVNZ from the rollout of colour broadcasting. In the DACH countries, the PM5544 test card was used by the Austrian public broadcaster ORFhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xReZzv1sxgU and the German commercial terrestrial channel RTL.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8J-JjXK6tI Use of the PM5544 in the DACH was solely confined to these two broadcasters as most TV stations in these areas instead preferred to use the Telefunken FuBK test card when they adopted colour television. In Spain, the PM5544 test card was used by the various autonomous and private channels since the early 1980s notably by TV3, El 33, Telemadrid, Antena 3, and Canal+ Spain, although not by the national public broadcaster TVE, which had used its own colour test card from 1975 until the early-2000s. In South Africa, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) made use of the PM5544 pattern since they started testing their first television system in 1975, but independent broadcasters M-Net, which launched in 1986, and e.tv, which launched in 1998, opted not to. Saudi Broadcasting Authority (SBA) in Saudi Arabia previously used a heavily modified version of the Philips PM5544 pattern from 1982 until 2009, with the side \\"brackets\\" removed and 1/4 of the top half of the PM5544 \\"circle\\" replaced with a white and black background and colour bars.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEs-uVRJ5QI Some television stations have also been seen to have included a digital clock and/or date, as well as the station logo or ID, inside the \\"circle\\" of the PM5544 test card. This practice is common in Asia and in some parts of Europe, as well as in South Africa. A widescreen-capable Philips Pattern generator, the PM5644, was introduced by Philips in the 1990s. The widescreen version of the test card retains the signals present in the original, and features additional signals to test further aspects of signal and picture quality, as well as overscan markings. As with its predecessor, the widescreen Philips Pattern was adopted by various other manufacturers of test pattern generators. Because of the number of manufacturers and generators made over the years to produce the Philips Pattern, various configurations and modifications exist. While the basic specifications normally remain consistent, there are often small variations to the Philips Pattern depending on the brand and type of generator used to produce it, as well as how the broadcaster has chosen to configure it.

The first group was organized in 1871 to tour and raise funds for college. Their early repertoire consisted mostly of traditional spirituals, but included some songs by Stephen Foster. The original group toured along the Underground Railroad path in the United States, as well as performing in England and Europe. Later 19th-century groups also toured in Europe. In 2002 the Library of Congress honored their 1909 recording of \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\" by adding it in the United States National Recording Registry. In 2008 they were awarded a National Medal of Arts.  History  Fisk Jubilee Singers, circa 1870s The Singers were organized as a fundraising effort for Fisk University. The historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee was founded by the American Missionary Association and local supporters after the end of the American Civil War to educate freedmen and other young African Americans. In 1871, the five-year-old university was facing serious financial difficulty. To avert bankruptcy and closure, Fisk's treasurer and music director, George L. White, a white Northern missionary dedicated to music and proving African Americans were the intellectual equals of whites,Ward, Andrew (2000), \\"Dark Midnight When I Rise: The Story of the Jubilee Singers Who Introduced the World to the Music of Black America\\". gathered a nine-member student chorus, consisting of four black men (Isaac Dickerson, Ben Holmes, Greene Evans, Thomas Rutling) and five black women (Ella Sheppard, Maggie Porter, Minnie Tate, Jennie Jackson, Eliza Walker) to go on tour to earn money for the university. On October 6, 1871, the group of students, consisting of two quartets and a pianist, started their U.S. tour under White's direction. They first performed in Cincinnati, Ohio. Over the next 18 months, the group toured through Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.Jubilee Singers Timeline 1869-1874, The American Experience website, PBS and WGBH, accessed August 4, 2009. After a concert in Cincinnati, the group donated their small profit, which amounted to less than sixty dollars, to the relief to the victims of the Great Chicago Fire of October 1871.Fisk Jubilee Singers: Our History , accessed August 4, 2009. As soprano Maggie Porter recalled, \\"We had thirty dollars and sent every penny to Chicago and didn‚Äôt have anything for ourselves.\\" The mayor of Chillicothe, Ohio, expressed \\"thanks to these young colored people for their liberality in giving the proceeds of last evening‚Äôs concert to our relief fund for the Chicago sufferers.\\" The group traveled on to Columbus, Ohio, where lack of funding, poor hotel conditions, and overall mistreatment from the press and audiences left them feeling tired and discouraged. The group and their pastor, Henry Bennett, prayed about whether to continue with the tour. White went off to pray as well; he believed that they needed a name to capture audience attention. The next morning, he met with the singers and said \\"Children, it shall be Jubilee Singers in memory of the Jewish year of Jubilee.\\" This was a reference to Jubilee described in the book of Leviticus in the Bible. Each fiftieth Pentecost was followed by a \\"year of jubilee\\" in which all slaves would be set free. Since most of the students at Fisk University and their families were newly freed slaves,Brooks, Tim (2004), Lost Sounds: Blacks and the Birth of the Recording Industry 1890-1919. the name \\"Jubilee Singers\\" seemed fitting. Jubilee Hall at Fisk University The Jubilee Singers' performances were a departure from the familiar \\"black minstrel\\" genre of white musicians' performing in blackface. One early review of the group's performance was headlined \\"Negro Minstrelsy in Church--Novel Religious Exercise,\\" while further reviews highlighted the fact that this group of Negro minstrels were, oddly enough, \\"genuine negroes.\\" \\"Those who have only heard the burnt cork caricatures of negro minstrelsy have not the slightest conception of what it really is,\\" Doug Seroff quotes one review of a concert by the group as saying. This was not a uniquely American response to the group's performance, but was typical in audience receptions in Europe as well: \\"From the first the Jubilee music was more or less of a puzzle to the critics; and even among those who sympathised with their mission there was no little difference of opinion as to the artistic merit of their entertainments. Some could not understand the reason for enjoying so thoroughly as almost everyone did these simple unpretending songs.\\" As the tour continued, audiences came to appreciate the singers' voices, and the group began to be praised. The Jubilee Singers are credited with the early popularization of the Negro spiritual tradition among white and northern audiences in the late 19th century; many were previously unaware of its existence.Ben S. Austin, The Fisk University Jubilee Singers , Middle Tennessee State University. Accessed 5 January 2009. At first the slave songs were never sung in public, according to Ella Sheppard; \\"they were sacred to our parents, who used them in their religious worship and shouted over them...It was only after many months that gradually our hearts were opened to the influence of these friends and we began to appreciate the wonderful beauty and power of our songs.Penguin Portable Nineteenth Century African American Women Writers, Ed. Hollis Robbins and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. 2017, p. 230 After the rough start, the first United States tours eventually earned $40,000 for Fisk University. In early 1872 the group performed at the World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival in Boston, and they were invited to perform for President Ulysses S. Grant at the White House in March of that year. They gave a separate performance in Washington, D.C., for Vice President Schuyler Colfax and members of the U.S. Congress. They traveled next to New York, where they performed before enthusiastic audiences at preacher Henry Ward Beecher‚Äôs Plymouth Church in Brooklyn and at Steinway Hall in Manhattan. They garnered national attention and generous donations. Staying in the New York area for six weeks, by the time they returned to Nashville, they had raised the full $20,000 White had promised the university. In a tour of Great Britain and Europe in 1873, the group, by then with 11 members, performed \\"Steal Away to Jesus\\" and \\"Go Down, Moses\\" for Queen Victoria in April. They returned the following year, they sailed to Europe again, touring from May 1875 to July 1878 and drawing rave reviews. This tour raised an estimated $150,000 for the university, funds used to construct Fisk's first permanent building. Named Jubilee Hall, the building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975 and still stands.Kay Beasley, Fisk Jubilee Singers (1871‚Äì), Tennessee State University. Accessed 31 August 2006. The original Jubilee Singers disbanded in 1878 because of their grueling touring schedule. As Ella Sheppard, one of the original Jubilee Singers recalled, \\"our strength was failing under the ill treatment at hotels, on railroads, poorly attended concerts, and ridicule.\\" Porter also said, \\"There were many times, when we didn‚Äôt have place to sleep or anything to eat. Mr. White went out and brought us some sandwiches and tried to find some place to put us up.\\" Other times while the singers would wait in the railway station, White \\"and some other man of the troupe waded through sleet or snow or rain from hotel to hotel seeking shelter for us\\". A new Jubilee Singers choir was formed in 1879 under the direction of George L. White and singer Frederick J. Loudin.George Leonard White, The American Experience website, PBS and WGBH, accessed August 4, 2009. This troupe, formed by White, consisted of Jennie Jackson, Maggie Porter, Georgia Gordon, Mabel Lewis, Patti Malone, Hinton Alexander, Benjamin W. Thomas, and newcomers R. A. Hall, Mattie Lawrence, and George E. Barrett. A. Cushing was the agent who managed their bookings. The original Jubilee Singers introduced slave songs to the world in 1871 and were instrumental in preserving this unique American musical tradition known today as Negro spirituals. They influenced many other troupes of jubilee singers who would go on to make their own contributions to the genre, such as the Original Nashville Students. They broke racial barriers in the US and abroad in the late 19th century. They raised money in support of their beloved school due to it failing. In 1999, the Fisk Jubilee Singers were featured in the documentary Jubilee Singers: Sacrifice and Glory, which aired on PBS' American Experience. In July 2007, the Fisk Jubilee Singers went on a sacred journey to Ghana at the invitation of the U.S. Embassy. It was a history making event, as it was their first time visit to Ghana. In 2008, the Fisk Jubilee Singers were selected as a recipient of the 2008 National Medal of Arts, the nation's highest honor for artists and patrons of the arts.

La Fille mal gard√©e (English: The Wayward Daughter, literal translation: \\"The Poorly Guarded Girl\\" and also known as The Girl Who Needed Watching) is a comic ballet presented in two acts, inspired by Pierre-Antoine Baudouin's 1765 painting, La r√©primande/Une jeune fille querell√©e par sa m√®re. The ballet was originally choreographed by the Ballet Master Jean Dauberval to a pastiche of music based on fifty-five popular French airs. The ballet was premiered on 1 July 1789 at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux in Bordeaux, France under the title Le ballet de la paille, ou Il n'est qu'un pas du mal au bien (The Ballet of Straw, or There is Only One Step from Bad to Good). La Fille mal gard√©e is one of the oldest and most important works in the modern ballet repertory, having been kept alive throughout its long performance history by way of many revivals. The work has undergone many changes of title and has had no fewer than six scores, some of which were adaptations of older music. Today La Fille mal gard√©e is normally presented in one of two different versions: many ballet companies feature productions which are derived from Alexander Gorsky's version to the music of Peter Ludwig Hertel, originally staged for the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in 1903. Gorsky's version was almost entirely based on Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's 1885 staging for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg. The Petipa/Ivanov staging was itself based on Paul Taglioni's version to the music of Peter Ludwig Hertel, originally staged in 1864 for the Court Opera Ballet of the K√∂nigliches Opernhaus in Berlin. Modern audiences are perhaps most familiar with the production staged by Frederick Ashton for the Royal Ballet in 1960. The appealing simplicity and the na√Øve familiarity of the action of La Fille mal gard√©e have lent it a popularity that has established it in the repertory of many ballet companies all over the world. The origins of La Fille mal gard√©e Pierre-Antoine Baudouin's painting Le reprimande/Une jeune fille querell√©e par sa m√®re. La Fille mal gard√©e was the creation of Jean Dauberval, one of the greatest choreographers of his day. He was trained under the influential teacher Jean-Georges Noverre and is further distinguished as the teacher of Charles Didelot, known today as \\"The Father of Russian Ballet\\". Legend has it that Dauberval found his inspiration for La Fille mal gard√©e while in a Bordeaux print shop, where he viewed an engraving of Pierre-Antoine Baudouin's painting Le reprimande/Une jeune fille querell√©e par sa m√®re. The painting showed a girl in tears with her clothes disarrayed being berated by an old woman (presumably her mother) in a hay barn, while her lover can be seen in the background scurrying up the stairs to the safety of the loft. Allegedly this quaint work of art amused Dauberval so much that he immediately set out to craft a suitable scenario for a ballet. The ballet was first presented at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux in Bordeaux, France on 1 July 1789. Dauberval's wife, la danseuse Marie-Madeleine Cresp√© (known to history as Mme. Th√©odore), created the role of Lison (or Lise, as the character is known in modern versions), the danseur Eug√®ne Hus created the role of Colin (or Colas), and Francois Le Riche created the role of the Widow Ragotte (now known as Widow Simone in modern versions). The ballet's original title was Le ballet de la paille, ou Il n'est qu'un pas du mal au bien (\\"The Ballet of the Straw, or There is Only One Step from Bad to Good\\"). The work met with public success and proved to be Dauberval's most popular and enduring work. =The music= In the late 18th and early 19th centuries scores for ballets were often patchworks (or a pastiche) of popular airs derived from well-known dances, songs and/or operas. These scores were often arranged and adapted by either the theatre's director of music or by the lead violinist of the opera house's orchestra, who at the time also served as conductor (the separate role of orchestral conductor was not yet established). The 1789 score for La Fille mal gard√©e was itself an arrangement of fifty-five popular French airs. The surviving orchestral parts of the 1789 score do not list a composer/arranger, and no extant contemporary account of the original production mentions a composer. It is possible that Dauberval himself arranged the score, for he certainly devised the ballet's scenario and was a competent violinist. If it was not his work, then it may have been one of the musicians employed by the theatre. =Revivals of Dauberval's original version= Announcement for the premiere of La Fille mal gard√©e at the Pantheon, London, 1791. Two years after the premiere, Dauberval travelled to London to mount the work for the Ballet of the King's Pantheon Theatre, and for the occasion he changed the title of the ballet to La Fille mal gard√©e, as the ballet is now commonly known. For the first performance on 30 April 1791, Dauberval's wife Mme. Th√©odore reprised her role as Lise, while Dauberval's student, Charles Didelot danced Colas. The 1789 score was loathed by the musicians of the Pantheon Theatre Orchestra. When the orchestral parts were rediscovered in 1959 by the ballet historian and musicologist Ivor Guest and the conductor John Lanchbery, they were found to be covered with comments ranging from the witty to the crude. In the original manuscript the title of the ballet was sprawled atop the pages. The lead violinist of the first London performance crossed out the title, and in its place wrote \\"Filly-Me-Gardy\\". Eug√®ne Hus, creator of the role of Colas, staged Dauberval's La Fille mal gard√©e in 1803 at the old Paris Op√©ra, the Salle de la rue de Richelieu, predecessor of the Salle Le Peletier. Prior to this production, Hus utilised the ballet's libretto in 1796 for a comic opera titled Lise et Colin, which was set to the music of Pierre Gaveaux. Jean- Pierre Aumer's new version to the music of H√©rold Mme. Th√©odore Dauberval, creator of the role of Lise. Paris, 1761. The choreographer Jean-Pierre Aumer, a student of Dauberval, continuously revised Hus's 1803 production throughout his career as ballet master at the Paris Op√©ra. He then travelled to Vienna in 1809 to mount the work for the Ballett des imperialen Hoftheater n√§chst der Burg. On 17 November 1828, Aumer presented a completely new version of La Fille mal gard√©e at the Paris Op√©ra especially for the Ballerina Pauline Montessu. For this revival the composer Ferdinand H√©rold created an adaptation of the original score of 1789. H√©rold also borrowed many themes from the operas of such composers as Jean Paul Egide Martini and Gaetano Donizetti. =The Fanny Elssler pas de deux= In 1837, the great Austrian Ballerina Fanny Elssler made her debut at the Paris Op√©ra in Aumer's production of La Fille mal gard√©e. As was the custom of the time, a ballerina would commission new Pas and variations to be interpolated into already existing ballets for their own performances. Making use of the extensive archives in the Paris Op√©ra's library, the ballerina selected her favourite airs from Donizetti's extremely popular score for the opera L'elisir d'amore. The library's copyist Aim√©-Ambroise-Simon Leborne assembled and orchestrated the music for her. Elssler's Grand pas was resurrected by the musicologist and historian Ivor Guest for Ashton's 1960 production of La Fille mal gard√©e for the Royal Ballet. Paul Taglioni's new version to the music of Hertel The Italian choreographer Paul Taglioni, uncle of the legendary Marie, was engaged as ballet master to the Court Opera Ballet of the K√∂nigliches Opernhaus in Berlin from 1852‚Äì1866. On 7 November 1864, Taglioni presented his own completely new staging of La Fille mal gard√©e under the title Das schlecht bewachte M√§dchen (The Badly Guarded Girl). For this production Taglioni commissioned an entirely new score from the K√∂nigliches Opernhaus's resident composer of ballet music Peter Ludwig Hertel. This production premiered to a resounding success, and was retained in the company's repertory for many years. In May 1876, the Italian ballerina Virginia Zucchi made her debut in Taglioni's production in Berlin. The celebrated ballerina triumphed in the role of Lise, revitalising the work with her expressive portrayal. La Fille mal gard√©e in Russia La Fille mal gard√©e was staged for the first time in Russia by the Ballet Master Giuseppe Solomoni in 1800 for Michael Maddox's Petrovsky Theatre (the predecessor of the Bolshoi Theatre) in Moscow, a production that was later revised by Solomoni's successor Jean Lamiral in 1808. Both productions utilised the original pastiche score of 1789, perhaps in adaptations prepared for each respective staging. The first production of La Fille mal gard√©e to be performed by the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet was staged by Jean Dauberval's student Charles Didelot, who performed the role of Colas in the London revival of 1791. Didelot‚Äîwho served as Ma√Ætre de ballet to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres from 1801‚Äì1811 and from 1816‚Äì1837‚Äîpresented his version of La Fille mal gard√©e on at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, under the title La Pr√©caution inutile, ou Lise et Colin (Vain Precaution, or Lise and Colin). The work was set to music by the composer Catterino Cavos. A production of Jean- Pierre Aumer's 1828 version of La Fille mal gard√©e, set to the music of H√©rold, was first staged in Russia at the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre in 1845 by the Balletmaster Irakly Nikitin. The great choreographer Jules Perrot‚ÄîPremier Ma√Ætre de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres from 1850‚Äì1859‚Äîstaged his own version of Aumer's production for the company in 1854, and for this production added new music to the ballet by the composer Cesare Pugni. Perrot's staging was given for the last time in 1880 for a benefit performance for the Imperial Ballet's Premier danseur Pavel Gerdt. =Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's revival= Virginia Zucchi as Lise in Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's revival of La Fille mal gard√©e, St. Petersburg, 1885. The great Italian ballerina Virginia Zucchi toured St. Petersburg in 1885, performing successfully in different works at various theatres throughout the Imperial capital. In August of that year Emperor Alexander III requested that the Imperial Theatre's director Ivan Vsevolozhsky invite Zucchi to perform with the Imperial Ballet. Zucchi agreed, and chose Paul Taglioni's 1864 version of La Fille mal gard√©e to the music of Hertel for her d√©but. The director Vsevolozhsky was required to pay an extremely high price to obtain Hertel's score from Berlin, while Zucchi herself commanded large fees plus a benefit performance in her contract. The production of La Fille mal gard√©e was staged jointly by the Imperial Ballet's Premier ma√Ætre de ballet Marius Petipa and the company's r√©gisseur and second ballet master Lev Ivanov, while Zucchi herself would assist with staging some of the dances she had known from Paul Taglioni's version. The production also incorporated dances from the Imperial Ballet's old production to the music of H√©rold. The reasons for the joint staging by both Petipa and Ivanov are not entirely clear, though it may be due to the fact that Ivanov was needed to stage the numbers brought out from the old production of the ballet. Petipa was responsible for the setting of all of the new dances, and even commissioned the composer Ludwig Minkus to score music for two additional variations for Zucchi. The production premiered under its traditional title in Russia La Pr√©caution inutile (Vain Precaution) on . Zucchi's performance as Lise instantly became a legend in Russia, where she was soon known as \\"The Divine Virginia\\". During the famous mimed scene known as \\"When I'm Married\\", contemporary accounts tell us that Zucchi's performance made such an impression that it brought many in the audience to tears. The ballerina was much celebrated for the famous Pas de ruban, for which Lise and Colas dance a pas elaborated by the use of ribbons, with Colas pretending to be a horse and Lise running along. After Zucchi left the Imperial stage, Lev Ivanov mounted an abridged version of La Fille mal gard√©e for performances at the Imperial Theatre of Krasnoe Selo in the summer of 1888. The role of Lise was performed by the ballerina Alexandra Vinogradova, who reprised the role in October of that same year on the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre (principal theatre of the Imperial Ballet and Opera from 1886). This was the last performance of the ballet until 1894, when Ivanov again revived the ballet for the visiting German ballerina Hedwige Hantenb√ºrg. Thereafter the work found a permanent place in the Imperial Ballet's repertory. La Fille mal gard√©e proved to be a useful vehicle for the great ballerinas of the old Imperial stage, most notably Olga Preobrajenskaya, Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina. For some time the renowned ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya did not allow any other danseuse to perform the role of Lise. A feature of the Ivanov production was the use of live chickens on stage. One evening when Preobrajenskaya danced the role of Lise, her rival Kschessinskaya let all of the chickens out of their coops during her variation, with many of them landing in the orchestra pit and even on the laps of many of the musicians. Preobrajenskaya kept on dancing as if nothing happened. The difficulties brought upon the Russian ballet as a result of the 1917 revolution caused a substantial number of works in the Imperial Ballet's repertory to cease being performed and eventually become lost. The Imperial Ballet's production of La Fille mal gard√©e was performed for the last time on , only one month prior to the October revolution, with the ballerina Elsa Vill as Lise. =Notation of the Imperial Ballet's production= As with many of the works that comprised the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet's repertory at the turn of the 20th century, the Petipa/Ivanov/Hertel production of La Fille mal gard√©e was notated in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation by the company's r√©gisseur Nicholas Sergeyev and his team of notators. Sergeyev brought these notations with him when he left Russia in 1917 and utilised them to mount such ballets as the Petipa/Ivanov Swan Lake, Petipa's The Sleeping Beauty, the Imperial Ballet's original 1892 The Nutcracker, the Petipa/Ivanov/Cecchetti Copp√©lia, and Petipa's definitive Giselle for the first time outside of Russia, primarily for the Royal Ballet. Today all of these notations, including those for the Imperial Ballet's production of La Fille mal gard√©e, are part of a collection known as the Sergeyev Collection, which is today housed in the theatre collection of the Harvard University Library. In 2015 the choreographer and historian Sergei Vikharev staged a production of La Fille mal gard√©e for the State Ballet of Ekaterinburg that utilized the notation from the Sergeyev Collection. The production premiered on 15 May 2015 at the Ekaterinburg State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre. La Fille mal gard√©e in the 20th century =Alexander Gorsky's revival= On , an important revival of La Fille mal gard√©e premiered at the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. This version was staged by Alexander Gorsky, a former danseur of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres who served as Premier ma√Ætre de ballet of the Moscow troupe. Gorsky's 1903 version was based on the Petipa/Ivanov production that he learned during his career in St. Petersburg. Gorsky's version used much additional music added to the score of Hertel, including pieces by Cesare Pugni, Ludwig Minkus, L√©o Delibes, Riccardo Drigo and Anton Rubinstein. It is this version of La Fille mal gard√©e that would eventually serve as the basis for nearly every production mounted in Russia, Europe and the Americas for many decades. Gorsky's version of the Grand pas de deux from the second act, loosely known as La Fille mal gard√©e pas de deux, is now a famous repertory excerpt on the gala and competition circuit, and is still performed regularly by the Vaganova School as part of their annual graduation performances at the Mariinsky Theatre. =Soviet-era productions= Final scene from Act II of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's revival of La Fille mal gard√©e, St. Petersburg, 1994. In 1930 the choreographers Asaf Messerer and Igor Moiseyev mounted a new version La Fille mal gard√©e for the Bolshoi Ballet, which was based on the 1903 edition by Gorsky. For this production Messerer and Moiseyev added a new act to the ballet titled The Wedding of Lise and Colas, set to an arrangement of music taken from Glinka's Orpheus. Messerer and Moiseyev's version remained in the Bolshoi Theatre's repertory for only two years, and was then revived under the title The Rivals in 1935, with the Hertel/Glinka music revised by the conductor Alexander Mosolov. This version was given only eighteen performances and then dropped from the repertory altogether. The Bolshoi presented yet another revival of La Fille mal gard√©e in 1937, in a completely new version staged by the choreographer Leonid Lavrovsky. For this production Lavrovsky commissioned the composer Pavel Feldt to create a new score based on the traditional music of Hertel, which included all of the interpolated music the score acquired via Gorsky's revival. After eleven performances Lavrovsky's production was taken out of the Bolshoi Theatre's regular repertory, only to be presented at irregular intervals until the early 1970s. From then on the production was relegated only to occasional performances given by the top graduates of the Bolshoi Ballet Academy. In 1989 the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's director Oleg Vinogradov mounted a new version of the ballet for the Kirov Ballet, largely based on the traditional Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky productions from the turn of the 20th century. In spite of being a great success, Vinogradov's production was taken out of the repertory after his departure as director of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet in 1995, and to date the company has no production of the full-length work in their repertory. La fille mal gard√©e in the West Anna Pavlova in \\"La Fille mal gard√©e\\", 1912 The first performances of any Russian version of La Fille mal gard√©e (i.e., derived from Petipa and Ivanov's revivals) in the West were presented by the touring company of the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlova, one of the most celebrated interpreters of the role of Lise, who while touring London in 1912 performed in an abridged version of the ballet. Bronislava Nijinska staged the first production of La Fille mal gard√©e in the United States for American Ballet Theatre (then known as the Ballet Theatre) in 1940, a version based on the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky version to the music of Hertel. Nijinska's version was revived in 1941 under the title The Wayward Daughter and in 1942 under the title Naughty Lisette. The 1942 production was revised by Dimitri Romanoff in 1949 and was retained in the repertory of the company for many years. Romanoff returned to stage a new version of the ballet for the company in 1972, with Natalia Makarova as Lise. The Romanoff production proved to be a popular piece in the repertory of American Ballet Theatre, who retained the production until 1984. Many famous dancers such as Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gelsey Kirkland, Susan Jaffe, Cynthia Gregory, Fernando Bujones and Marianna Tcherkassky triumphed in the lead roles. Today the company includes Sir Frederick Ashton's version in their active repertory (originally staged for the Royal Ballet in 1960), though the so-called La Fille mal gard√©e pas de deux derived from the old version is often performed during gala performances. In 1942 the Ballet Russe de Monte- Carlo presented their first production of La Fille mal gard√©e, staged by the former ballerina of the Imperial Ballet Alexandra Balachova in a version largely based on Alexander Gorsky's production derived from the Petipa/Ivanov staging of the late 19th century. Many of the dancers who worked with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo went on to have successful careers as choreographers, teachers and balletmasters abroad, and would use Balachova's version as a basis for many revivals throughout the world. The celebrated ballerina Alicia Alonso danced Balachova's staging of La Fille mal gard√©e throughout the 1940s and 1950s and she would go on to stage her own version of the work for the Cuban Ballet in 1964. As a result, the majority of ballet companies in the Caribbean and South America regularly perform productions derived from Alonso's staging to the music of Hertel. In 1985 Claude Bessy staged her version of La Fille mal gard√©e for the Ballet School of the Paris Op√©ra, a production inspired by the 1972 version of Dimitri Romanoff for American Ballet Theatre. For this production Bessy used Hertel's 1864 score in an orchestration by the Paris Op√©ra's conductor Jean-Michel Damase. Frederick Ashton's Royal Ballet production In 1959, the choreographer Frederick Ashton began creating a completely new version of La Fille mal gard√©e for the Royal Ballet of London. This production premiered on 28 January 1960, with the ballerina Nadia Nerina as Lise, David Blair as Colas, Stanley Holden as the Widow Simone, and Alexander Grant as Alen. Since its inception Ashton's staging has become a celebrated classic of the ballet repertory. Sara Lamb (as Lise) and Martin Harvey (as Colas) in the Fanny Elssler pas de deux from Ashton's La Fille mal gard√©e, London, 2005. Originally Ashton intended to use the 1864 score of Peter Ludwig Hertel as it had been used for nearly every revival of the ballet since the late 19th century, but after close inspection of this music Ashton decided it would not suit his plans. At the suggestion of the ballet historian and musicologist Ivor Guest, Ashton found the light, simple music of the 1828 score by Ferdinand H√©rold, more suitable for his conception. Ashton then commissioned the Royal Opera House's conductor John Lanchbery to orchestrate and edit H√©rold's score, using it as a foundation for an entirely new score, for which Lanchbery composed a few new numbers, incorporating passages of the original pastiche music from the premiere of 1789 into the score, and one number from Hertel's score which was utilised for the famous Clog Dance. Ashton was disappointed that H√©rold's score contained no suitable Grand pas; Ivor Guest found a violin reduction of the pas de deux that Fanny Elssler had arranged for her performance in the ballet in 1837, tucked away in an old box of music at the Paris Op√©ra. This number is now known as The Fanny Elssler pas de deux. Ashton created what is considered to be among his most masterful choreography for his new version of La Fille mal gard√©e. He resurrected the Pas de ruban for Lise and Colas, in which the lovers perform a charming pas with intricate tricks using a pink satin ribbon. Ashton took this idea to an entirely new level with the Fanny Elssler pas de deux, devising a spectacular Grand adage for Lise, Colas and eight women with eight ribbons. Ashton also included Petipa's original mimed sequence known as When I'm Married, a passage that was performed by all of the great ballerinas of old when they danced the role of Lise. He was taught this passage by Tamara Karsavina, former Ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres and the Original Ballet Russe. She had in turn learned it from her teacher Pavel Gerdt, once the Imperial Ballet's leading male dancer who had partnered ballerinas of the late 19th century and early 20th century in the role of Lise. William Tuckett as the Widow Simone with members of the corps de ballet in the Clog Dance from the Royal Ballet's production of Ashton's La Fille mal gard√©e, London, 2006. To inspire Lanchbery to write music for the Clog Dance, Ashton took the composer to a performance of Lancashire clog dancers. This dance is performed in the ballet by Lise's mother, the Widow Simone. Lanchbery decided to use the leitmotiv for the Widow Simone from Hertel's score. Ashton fashioned a humorous number from this music for Simone and four ballerinas, at the beginning of which Lise tempts her mother with a pair of clogs; she puts them on and whirls into one of Ashton's most celebrated numbers, which also features the dancers using the clogs to perform sur la pointe (on their toes). Ashton's 1960 version of La Fille mal gard√©e has been staged for many companies throughout the world and has become the more or less \\"traditional\\" version, replacing the productions derived from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions danced in Russia to the music of Hertel. Among such companies are the Bolshoi Ballet (2002), and American Ballet Theatre (2004). In spite of this, the famous La Fille mal gard√©e pas de deux, which is taken from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions of the ballet, is still performed with regularity as a gala excerpt, and is often used by various young dancers on the ballet competition circuit. After Ashton's death, the rights to his staging of La fille mal gard√©e passed to Alexander Grant, the original performer of the role of Alain. In 2007, the Paris Op√©ra Ballet invited Grant to supervise a staging of Ashton's version, which premiered at the Palais Garnier on 22 July 2007 with Doroth√©e Gilbert as Lise, Nicolas Le Riche as Colas, Simon Valastro as Alain, and St√©phane Phavorin as Widow Simone. As part of a contract between the BBC and the Royal Ballet signed in 1961, La fille mal gard√©e was one of nine ballets filmed for television, and was broadcast over Christmas 1962 with the original cast.The Royal Ballet on BBC TV. About the House, November 1962, p29. There have been subsequent video recordings issued by the Royal Ballet. In 1962, Lanchbery recorded excerpts of music from his adaptation of H√©rold's score, and in 1983 he recorded the complete work, again for Decca Records. The Ballet du Rhin's revival of the 1789 original The performance history of La Fille mal gard√©e came full circle in 1989, when the Ballet du Rhin of Mulhouse, France presented a revival of Dauberval's original production of 1789. The production was staged by Ivo Cramer, an expert in late 18th century and early 19th century dance theatre, and the Ballet du Rhin's artistic director, Jean Paul Gravier. They painstakingly researched the original production, locating a copy of the original score in Stockholm, which describes the 1789 production, including details of the original mime passages. The original score was restored and orchestrated by the conductor Charles Farncombe. The designer Dominique Delouche created sets and costumes inspired by the designs used in the original. Though Dauberval's original choreography is lost, Cramer crafted dances in the style of the period, with heavy influence from folk dancing, as in the original. Cramer also restored the original scheme for the ballet's finale, in which the dancers, singing along with the music, shout out the refrain Il n'est qu'un pas du mal au bien (\\"There is Only One Step from Bad to Good\\"). The production was presented under the original title, Le ballet de la paille (\\"The Ballet of Straw\\"). Characters * Lise, (the badly-guarded daughter) * Colas, (Lise's beloved) * Widow Simone, (Lise's mother, traditionally danced by a man) * Alain, (Lise's rich dimwitted suitor) * Thomas, (Alain's father) * Notary * Farm workers, friends of Lise and Colas * Rooster and three hens'' Synopsis Lise and Colas are in love and want to marry. However, the Widow Simone wants Lise to marry the dimwitted, but extremely rich, Alain, and has arranged (with Alain's father Thomas) for a marriage contract between Lise and Alain. The Widow Simone does her best to keep Lise and Colas apart, but is unsuccessful in her attempts to do so. At harvest time the Widow Simone and Lise are taken to the field for a picnic lunch by Thomas and Alain. The farm workers join in a ribbon dance around a maypole, and the girls also join in a clog dance with the Widow Simone. There is a thunderstorm and everyone rushes for shelter. Alain is carried away on the wind by his open umbrella. The Widow Simone and Lise return to their home. The widow wants Lise to sit down at the spinning wheel and spin, but Lise spins while she is up dancing, nearly strangling the widow. After a while, the widow wants Lise to dance, and Lise shows signs of unhappiness, but obliges. The widow takes a tambourine to play in time with Lise's dancing. When the widow is asleep, Lise tries to steal the key from the widow's pocket, to prevent the widow from locking her in, but is unsuccessful. The crops are brought in by the farm workers, and the widow then leaves the house (after locking the door behind her to prevent Lise from leaving the house). Lise thinks about Colas and mimes being the mother of a large number of children. To her embarrassment, Colas suddenly rises from the stacked crops. At the sound of the Widow Simone's returning to the house, Lise and Colas look around desperately for a place where he can hide. Not finding anywhere suitable in the living room, Lise takes Colas to her room, and she returns to the living room just before Widow Simone enters the house. The Widow Simone orders Lise to go to her room and put on her wedding dress for her forthcoming marriage to Alain. The horrified Lise tries to remain where she is, but the Widow Simone pushes Lise into her room and locks the door. Thomas arrives with his son Alain (who is still clutching his umbrella). They are accompanied by a notary who is to act as witness to the marriage. The farm workers (friends of both Lise and Colas) also arrive. The Widow Simone gives Alain the key to Lise's room. When Alain unlocks the door to Lise's room, Lise appears in her wedding dress, accompanied by Colas. Thomas and Alain take offence, and the enraged Thomas tears up the marriage contract. Thomas, Alain and the notary leave the house in dudgeon. Lise and Colas then beg the Widow Simone to look favourably upon their suit. Love conquers all and the widow relents. Joyfully celebrating the happy outcome for Lise and Colas, everyone leaves, and the house is left quiet and empty, until Alain returns for his umbrella which he had accidentally left behind. So Alain is also happy with the love of his life ‚Äì his umbrella.

It used to be integrated with Leederville prior to the construction of the Mitchell Freeway through the suburb in 1972. The tiny section east of Southport Street is a commercial area with several warehouses, taking advantage of its location at the end of the Graham Farmer Freeway. The rest of the suburb is medium-density residential. The suburb backs onto Subiaco Oval and St John of God Subiaco Hospital. Many of the original residences still stand, with most being renovated next to newer double storey dwellings, leafy streets with some properties gaining views of the city. \\"Hill of Tara\\" is a newer subdivision with larger homes on bigger blocks, with many affording view of Lake Monger. It is served by a bus service along Cambridge Street and the Leederville train station (Joondalup line) and West Leederville train station (Fremantle line).  History  West Leederville, though informally known by that name for many years, was officially gazetted as a suburb in 1998. West Leederville is the earliest area of residential subdivision in the Town of Cambridge. It was originally formed from the sale and subdivision of the estate of William Henry Leeder that occurred from 1891. West Leederville Primary School was founded in 1898. Most of West Leederville's residential land was subdivided prior to 1903. The Home of the Good Shepherd Convent (now the Catholic Education Centre) was established in 1903 by the Good Shepherd Sisters. Most of West Leederville was well developed with houses before 1925. Until the 1950s, a tram ran down Woolwich Street. With a one in fourteen gradient, Woolwich Street was one of the steepest tram lines in the city.ABC Radio 720 'Last Tram Out of Perth' Wednesday, 20 July 2005 Subdivision of the Hill of Tara occurred in the 1990s when land was released around the Catholic Education Centre in Ruislip Street. Leederville Town Hall and Recreation Complex The Leederville Town Hall & Recreation Complex is bounded by Holyrood Street, Tower Street and Cambridge Street. It forms a central focus of West Leederville. It is historically significant in the development of Leederville and the surrounding district, and was developed in response to the rapid expansion of the suburb prior to the First World War. It was designed by A. E. Clarke and built in 1916 by local builder, W. H. Roberts. The Leederville Bowling Club was established to the rear of the Leederville Town Hall in 1906, and continues to operate both as a bowling club and a social venue. The bowling club was the first sporting facility established on the site and was developed in association with the Excelsior Masonic Lodge. The Fallen Soldier‚Äôs Memorial was designed and executed in 1924 by Pietro Porcelli. The Leederville Croquet Club operated on the site from 1908 until 2006.http://www.geocities.com/croquetwest/History.htm In 2007 the West Leederville Residents Association began a community garden on an unused area of council land next to the bowling club.

From 1985 to 2016, he was the bassist and singer for the veteran pop-rock band Chicago. Early career Scheff was a graduate of the class of 1980 at San Diego's Point Loma High School. He started his professional musical career in 1982 as a member of the Los Angeles‚Äìbased rock band named Keane. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he played in a variety of bands with musicians who went on to form Ratt. Chicago In mid-1985, 23-year-old Scheff joined the multiplatinum band Chicago, after Peter Cetera had departed the band to continue his solo career. His lead vocals were debuted on the 1986 single \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", a remake of their 1970 hit, then followed up with \\"Will You Still Love Me?\\" In addition to performing the band's classic material, Scheff had composed several original songs for the band, including their 1989 top-10 single \\"What Kind of Man Would I Be?\\" Scheff also co-wrote the song \\"Heart of Mine\\" with Bobby Caldwell and Dennis Matkosky. The song became a big hit for Boz Scaggs in 1988 and was included in the 1988 Boz Scaggs album Other Roads and the collection Hits!. Scheff performed \\"Heart of Mine\\" several years later in 2007 for a theater-in-the- round setting at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. Scheff, along with co-writers Peter Wolf and Ina Wolf, wrote the song \\"Bigger Than Elvis\\" in 1993 for what was intended to be Chicago's 22nd album. This song is about his father, Jerry Scheff, describing Jason's childhood memories of watching his father play on television. The album, however, was rejected by Warner Bros. in 1993, and remained unreleased until 2008, when Rhino released it as Chicago XXXII: Stone of Sisyphus. In 2005, Scheff and Chicago founding member Robert Lamm convinced the band to record Chicago XXX, their first collection of new material since 1991's Twenty 1. Scheff also enlisted Rascal Flatts vocalist and bassist Jay DeMarcus to serve as producer for the new album, which was released on March 21, 2006. Scheff co-wrote seven of the 12 songs on the CD. Scheff recorded as a solo artist, releasing a CD titled Chauncy in 1996, as well as several duets released only in Japan. He was part of two a cappella releases by West Coast All Stars. The first in 1997, called \\"California Dreamin'\\", included vocals by Joseph Williams, Bill Champlin, Bobby Kimball, and Scheff; the second in 1998, \\"Naturally\\", again featured Williams, Kimball, and Scheff, adding this time Tommy Funderburk as the fourth vocal. In the 2000s, he was part of Robert Lamm's solo band for performances and three albums. In 2005, Scheff (credited as Jason Chefe) appeared on the Pink Floyd tribute album Back Against the Wall, performing lead vocals and bass on the track \\"Run Like Hell\\", together with Dweezil Zappa (lead guitar), Tony Kaye (keyboard solo), Aynsley Dunbar (drums), Bob Kulick (electric guitar), and Billy Sherwood (keyboards). Scheff and Lamm also collaborated as the executive producers of Zosia Karbowiak's first international solo release in 2009 S.I.N.G. A few weeks after performing with Chicago for the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in April 2016, Scheff took a leave of absence from the band. Singer/bassist Jeff Coffey filled in for him on the summer tour. In October of that year, Scheff amicably left Chicago, with Coffey as his successor before he was initially replaced by Canadian tenor vocalist Neil Donell and bassist Brett Simons in late 2018. Although Scheff had already departed Chicago, he appeared in January 2017 in the CNN feature film by Peter Pardini Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago. Other work Scheff and Todd Rundgren performing in 2019 Following his years with Chicago, in 2016, Scheff participated as a judge for American Super Group and has worked with new artists trying to break into the music business by conducting songwriting workshops and music lessons. Scheff has participated in a number of fundraisers for charities and has been a featured bassist and vocalist with a number of other artists. Scheff toured in late 2019 with Todd Rundgren, Micky Dolenz, Christopher Cross, and Joey Molland of Badfinger in celebration of the Beatles' White Album on the It Was Fifty Years Ago Today ‚Äì A Tribute to the Beatles‚Äô White Album. Scheff performed the Chicago songs \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" and \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\\". Scheff also appeared in a workout video for P90X2 with Tony Horton.

In: Inauguration d'une plaque √† la m√©moire de Gabriel Lippmann par le Centre culturel et d'√©ducation populaire de Bonnevoie et la Section des sciences de l'Institut grand-ducal. Bonnevoie, le 13 avril 1984: 8‚Äì20. (16 August 1845 ‚Äì 13 July 1921) was a Franco- Luxembourgish physicist and inventor, and Nobel laureate in physics for his method of reproducing colours photographically based on the phenomenon of interference. Early life and education Gabriel Lippmann was born in Bonnevoie, Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: Bouneweg), on 16 August 1845. At the time, Bonnevoie was part of the commune of Hollerich (Luxembourgish: Hollerech) which is often given as his place of birth. (Both places, Bonnevoie and Hollerich, are now districts of Luxembourg City.) His father, Isa√Øe, a French Jew born in Ennery near Metz, managed the family glove-making business at the former convent in Bonnevoie. In 1848, the family moved to Paris where Lippmann was initially tutored by his mother, Miriam Rose (L√©vy), before attending the Lyc√©e Napol√©on (now Lyc√©e Henri-IV). He was said to have been a rather inattentive but thoughtful pupil with a special interest in mathematics. In 1868, he was admitted to the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in Paris where he failed the agr√©gation examination which would have enabled him to enter the teaching profession, preferring instead to study physics. In 1872, the French government sent him on a mission to Heidelberg University where he was able to specialize in electricity with the encouragement of Gustav Kirchhoff, receiving a doctorate with \\"summa cum laude\\" distinction in 1874.Jacques Bintz, \\"Gabriel Lippmann 1845‚Äì1921\\", in Gabriel Lippmann: Comm√©moration par la section des sciences naturelles, physiques et math√©matiques de l‚ÄôInstitut grand-ducal de Luxembourg du 150e anniversaire du savant n√© au Luxembourg, laur√©at du prix Nobel en 1908 (Luxembourg: Section des sciences naturelles, physiques et math√©matiques de l‚ÄôInstitut grand-ducal de Luxembourg en collaboration avec le S√©minaire de math√©matique et le S√©minaire d‚Äôhistoire des sciences et de la m√©decine du centre universitaire de Luxembourg, 1997), Jean-Paul Pier & Jos.

Professor Lippmann in the Sorbonne laboratory for research in physics (Biblioth√®que de la Sorbonne, NuBIS) Career Lippmann made several important contributions to various branches of physics over the years. Lippmann's electrometer (1872) =The capillary electrometer= One of Lippmann's early discoveries was the relationship between electrical and capillary phenomena which allowed him to develop a sensitive capillary electrometer, subsequently known as the Lippmann electrometer which was used in the first ECG machine. In a paper delivered to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow on 17 January 1883, John G. M'Kendrick described the apparatus as follows: :Lippmann's electrometer consists of a tube of ordinary glass, 1 metre long and 7 millimetres in diameter, open at both ends, and kept in the vertical position by a stout support. The lower end is drawn into a capillary point, until the diameter of the capillary is .005 of a millimetre. The tube is filled with mercury, and the capillary point is immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 6 of water in volume), and in the bottom of the vessel containing the acid there is a little more mercury. A platinum wire is put into connection with the mercury in each tube, and, finally, arrangements are made by which the capillary point can be seen with a microscope magnifying 250 diameters. Such an instrument is very sensitive; and Lippmann states that it is possible to determine a difference of potential so small as that of one 10,080th of a Daniell. It is thus a very delicate means of observing and (as it can be graduated by a compensation-method) of measuring minute electromotive forces.John G.

Retrieved 5 December 2010. Lippmann's PhD thesis, presented to the Sorbonne on 24 July 1875, was on electrocapillarity. =Piezoelectricity= In 1881, Lippmann predicted the converse piezoelectric effect. =Colour photography= A colour photograph made by Lippmann in the 1890s. It contains no pigments or dyes of any kind. Above all, Lippmann is remembered as the inventor of a method for reproducing colours by photography, based on the interference phenomenon, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1908. In 1886, Lippmann's interest turned to a method of fixing the colours of the solar spectrum on a photographic plate. On 2 February 1891, he announced to the Academy of Sciences: \\"I have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colours on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration.\\" By April 1892, he was able to report that he had succeeded in producing colour images of a stained glass window, a group of flags, a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a multicoloured parrot. He presented his theory of colour photography using the interference method in two papers to the Academy, one in 1894, the other in 1906. A standing wave. The red dots are the wave nodes The interference phenomenon in optics occurs as a result of the wave propagation of light. When light of a given wavelength is reflected back upon itself by a mirror, standing waves are generated, much as the ripples resulting from a stone dropped into still water create standing waves when reflected back by a surface such as the wall of a pool. In the case of ordinary incoherent light, the standing waves are distinct only within a microscopically thin volume of space next to the reflecting surface. Lippmann made use of this phenomenon by projecting an image onto a special photographic plate capable of recording detail smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. The light passed through the supporting glass sheet into a very thin and nearly transparent photographic emulsion containing submicroscopically small silver halide grains. A temporary mirror of liquid mercury in intimate contact reflected the light back through the emulsion, creating standing waves whose nodes had little effect while their antinodes created a latent image. After development, the result was a structure of laminae, distinct parallel layers composed of submicroscopic metallic silver grains, which was a permanent record of the standing waves. In each part of the image, the spacing of the laminae corresponded to the half-wavelengths of the light photographed. The finished plate was illuminated from the front at a nearly perpendicular angle, using daylight or another source of white light containing the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum. At each point on the plate, light of approximately the same wavelength as the light which had generated the laminae was strongly reflected back toward the viewer. Light of other wavelengths which was not absorbed or scattered by the silver grains simply passed through the emulsion, usually to be absorbed by a black anti-reflection coating applied to the back of the plate after it had been developed. The wavelengths, and therefore the colours, of the light which had formed the original image were thus reconstituted and a full-colour image was seen.Bolas, T. et al: A Handbook of Photography in Colours, Marion & Co.

In practice, the Lippmann process was not easy to use. Extremely fine-grained high-resolution photographic emulsions are inherently much less light-sensitive than ordinary emulsions, so long exposure times were required. With a lens of large aperture and a very brightly sunlit subject, a camera exposure of less than one minute was sometimes possible, but exposures measured in minutes were typical. Pure spectral colours reproduced brilliantly, but the ill-defined broad bands of wavelengths reflected by real- world objects could be problematic. The process did not produce colour prints on paper and it proved impossible to make a good duplicate of a Lippmann colour photograph by rephotographing it, so each image was unique. A very shallow-angled prism was usually cemented to the front of the finished plate to deflect unwanted surface reflections, and this made plates of any substantial size impractical. The lighting and viewing arrangement required to see the colours to best effect precluded casual use. Although the special plates and a plate holder with a built-in mercury reservoir were commercially available for a few years circa 1900, even expert users found consistent good results elusive and the process never graduated from being a scientifically elegant laboratory curiosity. It did, however, stimulate interest in the further development of colour photography. Lippmann's process foreshadowed laser holography, which is also based on recording standing waves in a photographic medium. Denisyuk reflection holograms, often referred to as Lippmann-Bragg holograms, have similar laminar structures that preferentially reflect certain wavelengths. In the case of actual multiple-wavelength colour holograms of this type, the colour information is recorded and reproduced just as in the Lippmann process, except that the highly coherent laser light passing through the recording medium and reflected back from the subject generates the required distinct standing waves throughout a relatively large volume of space, eliminating the need for reflection to occur immediately adjacent to the recording medium. Unlike Lippmann colour photography, however, the lasers, the subject and the recording medium must all be kept stable to within one quarter of a wavelength during the exposure in order for the standing waves to be recorded adequately or at all. =Integral photography= In 1908, Lippmann introduced what he called \\"integral photography,\\" in which a plane array of closely spaced, small, spherical lenses is used to photograph a scene, recording images of the scene as it appears from many slightly different horizontal and vertical locations. When the resulting images are rectified and viewed through a similar array of lenses, a single integrated image, composed of small portions of all the images, is seen by each eye. The position of the eye determines which parts of the small images it sees. The effect is that the visual geometry of the original scene is reconstructed, so that the limits of the array seem to be the edges of a window through which the scene appears life-size and in three dimensions, realistically exhibiting parallax and perspective shift with any change in the position of the observer. Reprinted in Benton \\"Selected Papers on Three-Dimensional Displays\\". This principle of using numerous lenses or imaging apertures to record what was later termed a light field underlies the evolving technology of light- field cameras and microscopes. When Lippmann presented the theoretical foundations of his \\"integral photography\\" in March 1908, it was impossible to accompany them with concrete results. At the time, the materials necessary for producing a lenticular screen with the proper optical qualities were lacking. In the 1920s, promising trials were made by Eug√®ne Estanave, using glass Stanhope lenses, and by Louis Lumi√®re, using celluloid. Lippmann's integral photography was the foundation of research on 3D and animated lenticular imagery and also on color lenticular processes. =Measurement of time= In 1895, Lippmann evolved a method of eliminating the personal equation in measurements of time, using photographic registration, and he studied the eradication of irregularities of pendulum clocks, devising a method of comparing the times of oscillation of two pendulums of nearly equal period. =The coelostat= Lippmann also invented the coelostat, an astronomical tool that compensated for the Earth's rotation and allowed a region of the sky to be photographed without apparent movement. Academic affiliations Lippmann was a member of the Academy of Sciences from 8 February 1886 until his death, serving as its president in 1912. In addition, he was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London, a member of the Bureau des Longitudes, and a member of the Grand Ducal Institute of Luxembourg.

Intensives are usually lexical formations, but there may be a regular process for forming intensives from a root. Intensive formations, for example, existed in Proto-Indo-European, and in many of the Semitic languages.  Grammatical categories  Intensives are generally used as adverbs. In general, they are placed before the verb that they modify, usually a form of the \\"be\\" verb. An example of common usage in American English today is \\"the heck\\"; as in \\"What the heck is going on here?\\". \\"The heck\\" can be left out of the sentence without changing the meaning; however, the sentence is less intense without it. There are many varieties that are equivalent to \\"the heck\\" that are generally considered vulgar or otherwise inappropriate in polite conversation, such as in modern usage with \\"the hell\\" or \\"the fuck\\". In the mid-19th century, \\"in tarnation\\" was in common usage. In Great Britain, \\"bloody well\\" is an intensive adverb in common usage, for example, \\"I will bloody well do it.\\"  Examples of intensifiers across languages  In American English, the usage of \\"this/that\\" has become common in intensive form. The usage of \\"this/that\\" as intensifiers can be compared to the intensifier \\"so\\", since they all belong in the booster category of intensifiers, that is, intensifiers used to describe a high claim of intensity. An example sentence of this would be, \\"I shouldn't be this tired.\\" which carries similar intensity as the sentence, \\"I am so tired.\\". Hebrew uses intensifiers to show distinction between the pi\`el (intensive) and hiph\`il (causative) binyans. Latin had verbal prefixes e- and per- that could be more or less freely added onto any verb and variously added such meanings as \\"To put a great deal of effort into doing something\\". For example, \\"ructa\\" (burp) compared to \\"eructa\\" (belch). When the same prefixes, especially per, were added to adjectives, the resulting meaning was very X or extremely X. Category:Grammar Category:Verb types  Intensive form in media  The use of intensive word form has been studied in regards to how it is used in popular television shows, movies, music, and online. In British English, the word \\"well\\" can be used as an adjective intensifier when used to describe a noun, such as in the sentence, \\"It's well good.\\" The study done by James Stratton showed that intensive word form used in media closely resembles the usage in conversational British English. To study this, Stratton analyzed the variety of intensifiers used in the British sitcom The Inbetweeners. The study found that \\"well\\" was the sixth most used intensifier of the twenty-two listed. Studies have also been conducted to examine the use of intensifiers in internet culture. The 2010 study conducted by Sali A. Tagliamonte focused on how youth participants used language in email, instant messaging, and in text messages. The study found that the word \\"so\\" is used frequently in online messaging as an intensifier, but at the time had not been integrated as heavily into everyday verbal communication. The study also found that, \\"Different intensifiers are variably associated with nonstandard and colloquial varieties of the language, which makes this an ideal linguistic site for the investigation of variation.\\" which can explain the differences in intensifier usage based on demographic.

It can be verbal or non-verbal, and can occur with or without self- awareness. Emotional expressions include facial movements like smiling or scowling, simple behaviors like crying, laughing, or saying \\"thank you,\\" and more complex behaviors like writing a letter or giving a gift. Individuals have some conscious control of their emotional expressions;Dorset Research & Development Support Unit, 2003. \\"Emotional Expression.\\" Retrieved on: July 23, 2007. however, they need not have conscious awareness of their emotional or affective state in order to express emotion. Researchers in psychology have proposed many different and often competing theoretical models to explain emotions and emotional expression, going as far back as James Charles Darwin's discussion of emotion as an evolved capacity. Though there is no universally accepted theory of emotion, theorists in emotion agree that healthy humans experience emotions and express them in a variety of ways, such as with their voices, faces, and bodies. The cultural norms and beliefs of a society also affect and shape the emotional expressions of its members, and expressions appropriate and important in one culture may be taboo in another.Marshall, T. C. (2005). Emotional intimacy in romantic relationships: A comparison of European and Chinese Canadian students Evidence shows that gay partners have higher levels of expressiveness than heterosexual. High expressiveness could be useful in constructively resolving relationship-related conflict. Models of emotion There are many different theories about the nature of emotion and the way that it is represented in the brain and body. Of the elements that distinguish between the theories of emotion, perhaps the most salient is differing perspectives on emotional expression. Some theories about emotion consider emotions to be biologically basic and stable across people and cultures. These are often called \\"basic emotion\\" perspectives because they view emotion as biologically basic. From this perspective, an individual's emotional expressions are sufficient to determine a person's internal, emotional state. If a person is smiling, they are happy. If a person is crying, they are sad. Each emotion has a consistent and specific pattern of expressions, and that pattern of responses is only expressed during that emotion and not during other emotions. Facial emotional expressions are particularly salient stimuli for transferring important nonverbal signals to others. For that reason, emotional expressions are the best direct indicators of affective attitudes and dispositions. There is growing evidence that brain regions generally engaged in the processing of emotional information are also activated during the processing of facial emotions. Some theories of emotion take the stance that emotional expression is more flexible, and that there is a cognitive component to emotion. These theories account for the malleability in emotion by proposing that humans appraise situations and, depending on the result of their appraisal, different emotions and the corresponding expressions of emotion are triggered. The tendency to appraise certain situations as one emotion or another can vary by person and culture; however, appraisal models still maintain that there are basic responses that are specific and consistent to each emotion that humans feel. Other theories of emotion propose that emotions are constructed based upon the person, situation, culture, and past experiences, and that there are no preset emotional responses that are consistent and specific to one emotion or another. =Basic model= The basic model of emotions finds its roots in Charles Darwin's The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals. Darwin claimed that the expression of emotions involves many systems: facial expression, behavioral response, and physical responses, which include physiological, postural, and vocal changes. Most importantly, Darwin claimed that emotional expression was consistent with his theories on evolution and thus, the expression of emotion is universal and should therefore be expressed similarly across race or culture. This is known as the universality hypothesis. Lastly, primates and animals exhibit precursors of muscle actions of the facial expressions of humans. Many researchers have expanded on Darwin's original theories on emotional expression. Paul Ekman, Carroll Izard and colleagues were the first to test Darwin's theory. These psychologists, through cross- cultural empirical tests found that there were a number of basic emotions that were universally recognized. Later studies suggested that facial expressions are unique to each emotion and are signals that convey information of one's internal state, and this information is used to coordinate social interactions. Overall, the basic emotion perspective assumes that emotions are unique events that occur as a result of special mechanisms, and each emotion has its own respective specific brain circuit. Moreover, the expression of each emotion has its own respective response, manifestation in face, voice, and body. The basic emotion view Ekman to create the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and Facial Expression Awareness Compassion Emotions (F.A.C.E). FACS is a database of compiled facial expressions, wherein each facial movement is termed an action unit (AU). F.A.C.E explains how to become keen at observing emotion in the faces of others. It consists of the Micro Expression Training Tool (METT), which trains individuals to disambiguate between emotional expressions through recognizing distinct facial expressions that are unique to each emotion. The second part of this training program trains individuals to read micro-expressions; a face elicits an emotion very quickly and the individual is prompted to report which emotion was seen. The Subtle Expression Training Tool (SETT) trains individuals to be able to recognize the subtle changes in a person's facial expression due to slight changes in emotional experiences. These subtle expressions can occur at the onset of emotions, or when an individual is actively suppressing the emotion. =Appraisal model= Appraisal models of emotion state that emotions are triggered by mental states that are truly unique in both form and function. Appraisal models are similar to the basic model of emotion in that both views consider that, once an emotion is triggered, emotional expressions are biologically predetermined and are displayed only in one emotion and every time that emotion is expressed. The main difference between basic emotion models and appraisal models is that appraisal models assume that there is a cognitive antecedent that determines which emotion is triggered. Traditional appraisal theories consider appraisals to be universal and like a set of switches that can be turned on by biological and environmental triggers. When a person makes an appraisal, an individual will react with an appropriate, emotional response that can include an external, emotional expression. More recent appraisal models account for variation in emotional expression by suggesting that cognitive appraisals are more like themes that can be triggered by a number of different actions and situations. Emotional expressions arise from these appraisals, which essentially describe the context of the situation. One appraisal model has developed the law of situational meaning, which states that emotions tend to be evoked by certain kinds of events. For example, grief is elicited by personal loss. In this case, personal loss would be the appraisal and one can express grief through emotional expressions. =Psychological construction model= Another model of emotion, called psychological construction, describes emotion as a construction that results from more basic psychological processes. In a psychological construction model, basic psychological processes like affect (positive or negative feeling combined with some degree of physiological activation), previous experiences, language, and executive functioning combine to form a discrete emotion experience. While some discrete emotions tend to have typical responses (e.g. crying when sad, laughing when happy) a psychological construction model can account for the wide variability in emotional expression (e.g. crying when extremely happy; laughing when uncomfortable). Psychological construction models call into question the assumption that there are basic, discrete emotion expressions that are universally recognized. Many basic emotion studies use highly posed, stereotypical facial expressions as emotional signals such as a pout, which would indicate one is feeling sad. These facial expressions can be better understood as symbols of emotion rather than signals. While these symbols have undeniable emotional meaning and are consistently observed during day-day emotional behavior they do not have a 1-to-1 relationship a person's internal mental or emotional state. For example, not everyone furrows their brow when they are feeling angry. Moreover, these emotional symbols are not universal due to cultural differences. For example, when Western individuals are asked to identify an emotional expression on a specific face, in an experimental task, they focus on the target's facial expression. Japanese individuals use the information of the surrounding faces to determine the emotional state of the target face. This challenges experiments that solely use a presentation of an isolated emotional expression in experiments because it is reflecting just a Western notion of emotion. =Social construction model= Social construction models generally say that there is no biological circuitry for emotions since emotions are solely based on experience and context. Some even suggest that certain emotions can only exist in the reciprocal exchanges of a social encounter. Since there are unique local languages and local moral orders, cultures can use the same emotion and expression in very different ways. Thus, emotional expressions are culturally-prescribed performances rather than internal mental events. Knowing a social script for a certain emotion allows one to enact the emotional behaviors that are appropriate for the cultural context. Emotional expressions serve a social function and are essentially a way of reaching out to the world.  Emotion regulation  Various researchers have highlighted the importance for an individual of being able to successfully regulate emotions. Ways of doing this include cognitive reappraisal (interpreting a situation in positive terms) and expressive suppression (masking signs of inner emotional states). Emotions are evident through facial expressions. Humans can express their own emotions and understand others as well. Humans can quickly identify happy expressions whereas the disgust expression takes longer to identify.Chen W, Lander K and Liu CH, 2011. \\"Matching faces with emotional expressions.\\" =Emotional intelligence= Theorists such as Gardner and Sternberg have each presented different definitions and categories of intelligence. Gunderman refers to emotional intelligence as a type of intelligence, in addition to the commonly used definition. He has defined it as \\"the ability to understand and respond to emotions in daily life\\". For instance, a person who does not face his or her emotions and tackle them may be constantly frustrated. This person will face troubles moving on with his or her life. Consequently, emotionally intelligent individuals are better at expressing and identifying their emotions and those of the people around them. Those who are adept at handling their emotions tend to live an easier life than those who are not. Since people with better emotional intelligence are sensitive to emotions, they are considered better team players and are family-oriented. Some researchers argue that emotional intelligence is biological, while others say it is innate. Gunderman states that emotional intelligence is a learned and an instinctual skill. According to him, it can be cultivated through three means: learning more about it, drawing attention to it for oneself and others, and reading the works of authors he considers to be emotionally intelligent, such as Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy. Through engaging in emotional expressions and regulation, it is contemplated more than before and brings forth considerable changes in life and attitude. Sy and Cote conducted a study that proved emotionally intelligent are more competent and perform better. Therefore, many companies are using \\"EI training programs\\" to increase matrix performance. =Disorders= There are a few disorders that show deficiency in emotional expression and response. These include alexithymia, autism, hypomimia and involuntary expression disorder.  Effects  Expressing emotions can have important effects on individuals‚Äô well-being and relationships with others, depending on how and with whom the emotions are shared. Emotions convey information about our needs, where negative emotions can signal that a need has not been met and positive emotions signal that it has been meet. In some contexts, conveying this information can have a negative impact on an individual; for example, when others ignore or exploit those needs. Researchers note that there a number of important benefits to expressing emotions selectively. In the case of distress, expression can help people take control of their emotions and facilitate ‚Äúmean-making‚Äù to help them reappraise their situation. For instance, emotional expression through writing can help people better understand their feelings, and subsequently regulate their emotions or adjust their actions. In research by Pennebaker, people who observed a traumatic death showed more improvements in physical health and subjective well-being after writing about their emotions over several days. This research also shows that these benefits only appear when individuals undergo a cognitive change, such as in gaining insight about their experience. Emotional expression has social implications as well. Since emotions are related to our needs, it is important that they are expressed to others who care about our needs. Expression to someone with whom there is no desire to form a relationship is likely to receive no response. Individuals who express negative emotions, in particular, may also appear less likeable as a result. However, when an individual expresses to someone who responds with empathy, their relationship with that person can improve. Like with writing, hearing another person‚Äôs perspective can help people reappraise the situation that incited those emotions. Additionally, emotional expression to someone else can be viewed as a form of disclosure and sign of trust with that person, thus promoting intimacy. For example, greater expression of emotions or willingness to express negative emotions, such as anxiety or fear, promotes the formation of more relationships, greater intimacy in those relationships, and more support from others.

The design began life as the Piper Lance, a retractable-gear version of the Piper Cherokee Six. Later models became known by the designation Piper Saratoga. The primary difference between the Lance and early Saratoga is the development of a tapered wing on the Saratoga, replacing the \\"Hershey bar\\" wing on the Lance that was a carryover from the Cherokee Six. Later Saratoga models provided updated/improved avionics, engine and interior touches but retained the same airframe design. Production of the Saratoga was discontinued in 2009. The Saratoga competed for sales with the Beechcraft Bonanza, Mooney Ovation, Cirrus SR22, Cessna 206 Stationair, and Cessna 350.

Afterwards, Piper began modifying its heavy-lifting single engined PA-32 Cherokee Six, adding retractable landing gear and designating the type as the \\"PA-32R\\". The PA-32R was built under license by Embraer in Brazil as the Embraer EMB-721 Sertanejo. Kits for the PA-32R-300 (six supplied), PA-32RT-300 (16) and PA-32RT-300T (two) were supplied to Chincul in Argentina for completion. They were designated the PA-A-32R and PA-A-32RT. For the 2008 model year, the Saratoga II HP (normally aspirated) model was eliminated, along with the 6X and 6XT (fixed-gear versions of the Saratoga), leaving the turbocharged Saratoga II TC as the only production model in the PA-32 line.Piper Aircraft Line Production of all PA-32 models ended in 2009.

Wrought Iron Railing with the song \\"Home Sweet Home\\" in Fredericksburg, Virginia \\"Home, Sweet Home\\" is a song adapted from American actor and dramatist John Howard Payne's 1823 opera Clari, or the Maid of Milan, the song's melody was composed by Englishman Sir Henry Bishop with lyrics by Payne. Bishop had earlier published a more elaborate version of this melody, naming it \\"A Sicilian Air\\", but he later confessed to having written it himself. The song's lyrics are: When the song was published separately, it quickly sold 100,000 copies. The publishers made a considerable profit from it, net ¬£2,100 in the first year, and the producer of the opera did well. Only Payne did not really profit by its success. \\"While his money lasted, he was a prince of bohemians\\", but had little business sense.Charles H. Sylvester, \\"John Howard Payne and 'Home, Sweet Home' \\", Journeys Through Bookland, Vol. 6, p. 221 (published 1922), The Project Gutenberg eBook In 1852 Henry Bishop \\"relaunched\\" the song as a parlour ballad, and it became very popular in the United States throughout the American Civil War and after. The song's American premiere took place at the Winter Tivoli Theatre in Philadelphia on October 29, 1823, and was sung by \\"Mrs. Williams.\\" As early as 1827 this song was quoted by Swedish composer Franz Berwald in his Konzertst√ºck for Bassoon and Orchestra (middle section, marked Andante). Gaetano Donizetti used the theme in his opera Anna Bolena (1830) Act 2, Scene 3 as part of Anna's Mad Scene to underscore her longing for her childhood home. It is also used with Sir Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs and in Alexandre Guilmant's Fantasy for organ Op. 43, the Fantaisie sur deux m√©lodies anglaises, both of which also use \\"Rule, Britannia!\\". In 1857 composer/pianist Sigismond Thalberg wrote a series of variations for piano (op. 72) on the theme of \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\". In 1909, it was featured in the silent film The House of Cards, an Edison Studios film. In the particular scene, a frontier bar was hurriedly closed due to a fracas. A card reading \\"Play Home Sweet Home\\" was displayed, upon which an on-screen fiddler promptly supplied a pantomime of the song. This may imply a popular association of this song with the closing hour of drinking establishments. The song was reputedly banned from being played in Union Army camps during the American Civil War for being too redolent of hearth and home and so likely to incite desertion. In 1926 a \\"Music Stair\\" railing (see image) at Chatham Manor in Fredericksburg, Virginia was designed by Washington, D.C. based architect Oliver H. Clarke for the homeowners, the Devores. The ornamental iron railing features the first few bars of the score to ‚ÄúHome, Sweet Home.‚Äù Home Sweet Home door knocker The Village of East Hampton acquired his grandfathers seventeenth-century house, known as \\"Home Sweet Home,\\" and the windmill behind it, converting the homestead into a living museum in the landmarked East Hampton Village District. The song is known in Japan as (\\"My Humble Cottage\\"). It has been used in such movies as The Burmese Harp and Grave of the Fireflies. It is also used at Senri-Ch≈´≈ç Station on the Kita-Osaka Ky≈´k≈ç Railway. Payne's tune, though, is perhaps most commonly recognized in the score from MGM's The Wizard of Oz. The melody is played in a counterpart to \\"Over the Rainbow\\" in the final scene as Dorothy (played by Judy Garland) tells her family, \\"there's no place like home\\". In the 1939 film First Love, the song is performed by Deanna Durbin. In the 1946 20th Century Fox film Anna and the King of Siam, as well as in Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1951 musical, The King and I (and its 1956 film adaptation), Anna Leonowens teaches her students to sing \\"Home! Sweet Home\\" as part of her psychological campaign to induce the King to build her a house of her own. Notable recordings Popular recordings were made by John Yorke AtLee (1891), Harry Macdonough (1902), Richard Jose (1906), Alma Gluck (1912), Alice Nielsen (1915) and Elsie Baker (1915). Later recordings were made by Deanna Durbin (recorded July 7, 1939 for Decca Records, catalog No. 2758B), Vera Lynn (1941) and by Bing Crosby (recorded July 30, 1945 with Victor Young and His Orchestra). The Crosby version was included in his album Auld Lang Syne (1948). Katherine Jenkins included the song in her album Home Sweet Home (2014).

Like many continental European countries it is largely based on jus sanguinis. It also incorporates many elements that are seen as favourable to the Italian diaspora. The Italian Parliament's 1992 update of Italian nationality law is Law no. 91, and came into force on 15 August 1992. Presidential decrees and ministerial directives, including several issued by the Ministry of the Interior, instruct the civil service how to apply Italy's citizenship-related laws. Acquisition of citizenship Cover of an Italian biometric passport issued in 2006 Italian citizenship can be automatically acquired: * By birth to an Italian parent in line with the principle of jus sanguinis. * By birth in Italy to stateless parents, to unknown parents, or to parents who cannot transmit their nationality to their children; this is partially consistent with the principle of jus soli. * With the acknowledgement or legitimation of an Italian mother or father. * On 27 April 1983 by minor children without Italian citizenship, including children legally adopted per Italian law, who as of the same date had a parent holding Italian citizenship; or after 27 April 1983 by foreign minor children legally adopted by Italian citizens per Italian law. * By some former citizens of Italy, after two years of residing in Italy, if the original parting with Italian citizenship was caused by naturalising in another state. The citizenship law 555 of 1912, discussed later, carried the pertinent provision until it was superseded. (article 9, law 555/1912) * By minor children of persons acquiring Italian citizenship. Before 27 April 1983, minor children could not acquire Italian citizenship by this means if they were living abroad from Italy and still retaining a foreign citizenship. * By Vatican citizens concluding their ex officio Vatican citizenship who would otherwise become stateless upon this event, pursuant to the provision in article 9 of the Lateran Treaty of 1929 between Italy and Vatican City. Through special application: * For an individual whose parents were Italian citizens born outside Italy but at least one of their grandparents was an Italian citizen born in Italy. The applicant must have served in the Italian military or civil service or have resided for two years in Italy after reaching the age of majority. * For individuals who were born in Italy to foreign parents but who have resided in Italy continuously from birth to adulthood. * For individuals whose applications was denied by administrative offices (Consulates), or if they are not able to submit the Italian Citizenship applications. Through marriage: * Foreign women who married an Italian citizen before 27 April 1983 were automatically granted Italian citizenship. * After 2 years legal residence in Italy, or 3 years living abroad. This time will be reduced by half if the couple have children (natural or adopted). The spouse of an Italian citizen can apply for Italian citizenship through naturalisation. As of 4 December 2018, the spouse must be accomplished in the Italian language to the level B1 (or higher) of the EU Common Language Framework. Through naturalisation: * A person who has been legally resident in Italy for at least ten years may apply for and be granted naturalisation as an Italian citizen if he or she does not have a criminal record and has sufficient financial resources. The residence requirement is reduced to three years for descendants of Italian citizen grandparents and for foreigners born in Italy, four years for nationals of EU member states, five years for refugees or stateless persons, and seven years for someone who was adopted as a child by an Italian citizen. Attribution of citizenship through jus sanguinis Inside cover of an Italian biometric passport issued in 2006 Citizens of other countries descended from an ancestor (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, etc.) born in Italy may have a claim to Italian citizenship by descent (or, in other words, by derivation according to jus sanguinis citizenship principles). Italian citizenship is granted by birth through the paternal line, with no limit on the number of generations, or through the maternal line for individuals born after 1 January 1948. An Italian citizen may be born in a country whose citizenship is acquired at birth by all persons born there. That person would be born therefore with the citizenship of two (or possibly more) countries. Delays in reporting the birth of an Italian citizen abroad do not cause that person to lose Italian citizenship, and such a report might in some cases be filed by the person's descendants many years after he or she is deceased. A descendant of a deceased Italian citizen whose birth in another country was not reported to Italy may report that birth, along with his or her own birth (and possibly the births of descendants in intermediate generations), to be acknowledged as having Italian citizenship. A person may only have acquired jus sanguinis Italian citizenship by birth if one or both of that person's parents was in possession of Italian citizenship on the birth date. There is a possibility in the law that the only parent who held Italian citizenship on the birth date of a child born with jus sanguinis Italian citizenship was the mother, who previously acquired the Italian citizenship by marriage to the father, who relinquished his own Italian citizenship before the child was born. Under certain conditions, a child born with Italian citizenship might later have lost Italian citizenship during his or her infancy. The event could prevent a claim of Italian citizenship by his or her descendants. If the Italian parents of a minor child naturalised in another country, the child may have remained holding Italian citizenship, or else may have lost the Italian citizenship. The children who were exempt from losing their Italian citizenship upon the foreign naturalisation of their parents were in many cases (dual) citizens of other countries where they were born, by operation of the jus soli citizenship laws in those countries. One must apply through the Italian consulate that has jurisdiction over their place of residence. Each consulate has slightly different procedures, requirements, and waiting times. However, the legal criteria for jus sanguinis citizenship are the same. Basic Criteria for Acquisition of Citizenship jus sanguinis: * There were no Italian citizens prior to 17 March 1861, because Italy had not yet been a unified state. Thus the oldest Italian ancestor from whom Italian citizenship is proven to be derived in any jus sanguinis citizenship claim must have been still alive on or after that date. * Any child born to an Italian citizen parent (including parents also having the right to Italian citizenship jus sanguinis) is ordinarily born an Italian citizen, with the following caveats: ** The Italian parent ordinarily must not have naturalised as a citizen of another country before both the child's birth date and the date 15 August 1992. ** If the child had an Italian mother and a foreign father, the child ordinarily must have been born on or after 1 January 1948. There have been many successful challenges to this date restriction that were brought before the Court of Rome. In their capacity to determine Italian citizenship, officers in Italian consulates and municipalities are bound by the restriction. ** If the Italian parent naturalised as a citizen of another country on or after 1 July 1912, and prior to 15 August 1992, then the child's Italian citizenship survived the parent's loss if the child was already born, and residing in a country whose citizenship he or she additionally held because of that country's jus soli nationality laws. Conversely, if the child was not born in a country whose citizenship was attributed to the child based on jus soli provisions in its nationality law, then the child could lose Italian citizenship by acquiring the citizenship of the naturalising parent. Italy generally does not attribute its citizenship based on jus soli, so an Italian child born in Italy could lose Italian citizenship in the event that his father naturalised. ** In the event that a person reached Italy's legal age of adulthood while possessing Italian citizenship, that person's holding of Italian citizenship ceased to be conditioned on the subsequent citizenship changes that might occur for that person's parents. So if the Italian parent naturalised as a citizen of another country, then the child's Italian citizenship could survive the parent's loss if he or she reached legal adulthood (age 21 prior to 10 March 1975; age 18 thereafter) prior to the parent's naturalisation. ** If the child's Italian father naturalised as a citizen of another country prior to 1 July 1912, the child's Italian citizenship was not directly impacted by the father's loss if the child reached legal adulthood (age 21) by the time the father naturalised, or else if the child was residing in Italy when the father naturalised. ** Italian citizens naturalising in another country prior to 15 August 1992, while being of legal adult age, typically lost their Italian citizenship at that time. ** Italy has been a participant in the Strasbourg convention on the reduction of cases of multiple citizenship. Children born outside of Italy with the citizenship of a member country may not have been able to hold Italian citizenship by birth because of this convention. The convention has also extended the era when Italians could lose citizenship by foreign naturalisation to dates later than 14 August 1992, if the naturalisation were in a participant country. All conditions above must be met by every person in a direct lineage. There is no generational limit, except in respect to the date of 17 March 1861. Note that if an Italian ancestor naturalised as a citizen of another country independently from his or her parents, and prior to reaching legal Italian adulthood (age 21 prior to 10 March 1975, and age 18 otherwise), then often that ancestor retained Italian citizenship even after the naturalisation and could still pass citizenship on to children. Also, having one qualifying Italian parent‚Äîwho except in certain situations could only have been the child's father if the birth occurred before 1 January 1948‚Äîis sufficient for deriving (inheriting) citizenship, even if the other Italian parent naturalised or otherwise became unable to pass on citizenship. Sometimes that qualifying parent is the foreign-born mother, because foreign women who married Italian men prior to 27 April 1983 automatically became Italian citizens and, in many cases, retained that citizenship even when their Italian husbands later naturalised. =Practical effects= A significant portion of jus sanguinis applicants are Argentines of Italian descent, as Argentina received a large number of Italian immigrants in the 1900s. The lack of limits on the number of generations of transmission of citizenship means that up to 60 million people, mostly in the Americas, could be entitled to Italian citizenship, a number that is larger than the population of Italy. This large number and the desire for EU citizenship has led to wait times for a jus sanguinis appointment of up to 20 years at some Italian consulates, particularly in Argentina and Brazil. Many of these Italians who do receive an Italian passport then use it to live in Spain or the United Kingdom. The landmark 1992 European Court of Justice case Micheletti v. Cantabria, a case of an Argentine Italian citizen by descent living in Spain whose Italian citizenship was challenged by Spain, established that EU member states were not permitted to distinguish between traditional citizens of a fellow EU state, like Italy, and persons who only had citizenship in another EU state through descent or jus sanguinis. The long consular waiting lines, combined with the difficulty of locating all the required documents, the fees, and the lack of reason to obtain a second passport for many people, act as a practical limit on the numbers who will actually apply. Legislative history of Italian citizenship =The Statuto Albertino of 1848= The Statuto Albertino, put forth in 1848 by the Kingdom of Sardinia, was the first basic legal system of the Italian state, formed in 1861. It was not a true constitution, but was essentially an outline of the fundamental principles on which the monarchic rule was based. Article 24 reads: \\"All subjects, whatever be their title or rank, are equal before the law. All enjoy equally the civil and political rights, and are admissible to the civil and military offices, except under circumstances determined in the Law.\\" This proclaimed equality before the law referred nonetheless only to men, since women were subordinate to the authority of the pater familias. This was held very pertinent in the matter of citizenship, as the subordination of women and also their children to the husband made it so that each event regarding the husband's citizenship would be transmitted to the family. These events could include the loss or reacquisition of citizenship. For example, the family might lose Italian citizenship if the husband naturalised in a foreign state. =Law no. 555 of 1912= On 13 June 1912, Law number 555, concerning citizenship, was passed, and it took effect on 1 July 1912. Despite the fact that the Statuto Albertino did not make any reference to equality or inequality between the sexes, the precept of the wife's subordination to the husband‚Äîone having ancient antecedents‚Äîwas prevalent in the basic legal system (the legislative meaning). There are numerous examples in the codified law, such as article 144 of the Civil Code of 1939 and, specifically, law number 555 of 13 June 1912 \\"On Italian Citizenship\\". Law 555 established the primacy of the husband in the marriage and the subordination of the wife and the children to his events pertinent to his citizenship. It established: * That jus sanguinis was the guiding principle, and that jus soli was an ancillary possibility. * The children followed the citizenship of the father, and only in certain cases, the citizenship of the mother. The mother could transmit the citizenship to her children born before 1 January 1948 (the effective date of entry of the Constitution of the Italian Republic) only in the special cases found in paragraph 2 of article 1 of this statute: These cases arose if the father was unknown, if he was stateless, or if the children could not share the father's foreign citizenship according to the law of his county (as in cases where the father belonged to a country where citizenship was possible by jus soli but not by jus sanguinis). In this last situation, the Ministry of the Interior holds that if the child received jus soli citizenship of the foreign country where he was born, the mother's Italian citizenship did not pass to the child, just as in situations where the child received the father's citizenship by jus sanguinis. * Women lost their original Italian citizenship if they married a foreign husband whose country's laws gave its citizenship to the wife, as a direct and immediate effect of the marriage. (This is a situation under review, since article 10 of this statute providing for the automatic loss of citizenship by marriage is in contrast with the second paragraph of article 8, having global scope, which does not approve of the automatic loss of citizenship by foreign naturalisation. The loss of citizenship under article 8 is not considered automatic because the voluntary acceptance of a new citizenship must have been manifested by the person naturalising for Italian citizenship to be lost pursuant to article 8). Dual citizenship under law no. 555 of 1912 Of central importance for the diaspora of Italians in many countries, as it relates to the holding of Italian citizenship alongside another citizenship, is article 7 of law number 555 of 1912. The provisions of this article gave immunity to some living Italian children from the citizenship events of their fathers. If the child was born to an Italian father in a jus soli country, the child was born with the Italian citizenship of the father and also with the citizenship of the country where he or she was born. That is to say that the child was born as a dual citizen. Children born with dual citizenship in this form were allowed to maintain their dual status in the event that the father naturalised later, thus parting with Italian citizenship. Moreover, Italy has not imposed limitations on the number of generations of its citizens who might be born outside Italy, even as holders of citizenship foreign to Italy. Article 7 reads: \\"Except in the case of special provisions to be stipulated by international treaties, an Italian citizen born and residing in a foreign nation, which considers him to be a citizen of its own by birth, still retains Italian citizenship, but he may abandon it when he becomes of age or emancipated.\\" Since Italian laws in this time were very sensitive to gender, it remains to be stated that the benefit of article 7 was extended to both male and female children. A girl of minor age could keep her Italian citizenship in accordance with article 7 after the naturalisation of her father‚Äîbut she still might not be able to pass her own citizenship to her children, particularly if they were born before 1948. Law 555 of 1912 contains a provision causing the Italian children of Italian widows to retain their Italian citizenship if the widow should acquire a new citizenship by remarrying, to be found in article 12. The children concerned could keep their Italian citizenship even if they received a new one by derivation from the mother when the remarriage occurred. Foreign women contracting marriage with Italian men before 27 April 1983 automatically became Italian citizens. If a woman's acquisition of Italian citizenship by marriage did not produce an effect upon the woman's citizenship in her country of origin, she was therefore a dual citizen. Article 10 of law 555 of 1912 provided that a married woman could not assume a citizenship different from that of her husband. If an Italian woman acquired a new citizenship while her husband remained Italian, she was a dual citizen, and law 555 of 1912 was not cognisant of her new status in the state where she acquired citizenship during her marriage. Loss of Italian citizenship under law no. 555 of 1912 Italian citizenship could be lost: * By a man or woman, being of competent legal age (21 years if before 10 March 1975 or 18 years if after 9 March 1975), who of his or her own volition naturalised in another country and resided outside of Italy. (article 8) Italian citizen women married to Italian citizen husbands could not lose their citizenship if the husband's Italian citizenship was retained. (article 10) * By the minor and unemancipated child‚Äîwithout the immunities from loss to be found in articles 7 and 12 (child with jus soli citizenship or child of remarried widow with consequent new citizenship)‚Äîwho, residing outside of Italy, held a non-Italian citizenship and lived with a father (or mother if the father was dead) whose Italian citizenship was also lost. (article 12) * By the woman whose Italian citizenship was a consequence of marriage to an Italian citizen, if upon becoming widowed or divorced, she returned to (or remained in) the country of her origin to live there as a citizen. (article 10) This scenario of loss was possible only before the date 27 April 1983. * By the citizen who accepted employment with or rendered military service to a foreign state, and was expressly ordered by the Italian government to abandon this activity before a deadline, and still persisted in it after the said deadline. (article 8) This kind of loss was rather uncommon, and could only occur if the Italian government contacted the citizen whose abandonment of service to a foreign government was demanded. Loss of Italian citizenship carried with it the inability to pass Italian citizenship automatically to children born during the period of not holding the citizenship. Still, Italian citizenship could sometimes be acquired by children of former citizens reacquiring the citizenship. Because law 555 of 1912 underwent revision to meet the republican constitution's requirement that the sexes be equal before the law, a determination of citizenship for a child involves an analysis of the events of both parents and possibly the ascendants of both. =The 1948 Constitution of the Republic= The constitution of the Italian Republic entered into effect on 1 January 1948. With the Salerno Pact in April 1944, stipulated between the National Liberation Committee and the Monarchy, the referendum on being governed by a monarchy or a republic was postponed until the end of the war. The 1848 constitution of the Kingdom of Italy was still formally in force at this time, since the laws that had limited it were, to some extent, abolished on 25 July 1943 (date of the collapse of the fascist regime). The referendum was held on 2 June 1946. All Italian men and women 21 years of age and older were called to vote on two ballots: one of these being the Institutional Referendum on the choice between a monarchy and a republic, the other being for the delegation of 556 deputies to the Constituent Assembly. The current Italian constitution was approved by the Constituent Assembly on 22 December 1947, published in the Official Gazette on 27 December 1947, and entered into effect on 1 January 1948. The original text has undergone parliamentary revisions. A Democratic Republic was instituted, based on the deliberations and sovereignty of the people. Individual rights were recognised, as well as those of the body public, whose basis was the fulfilment of binding obligations of political, economic, and social solidarity (articles 1 and 2). The fundamental articles that were eventually used to support new arguments concerning citizenship are as follows: Article 3, a part of the constitution's \\"Fundamental Principles\\", has two clauses. * The first clause establishes the equality of all citizens: \\"All citizens have equal social dignity and are equal before the law, without distinction of sex, race, language, religion, political opinions, personal and social conditions.\\" * The second clause, supplementary to the first and no less important, adds: \\"It is the duty of the Republic to remove those obstacles of an economic and social nature which, really limiting the freedom and equality of citizens, impede the full development of the human person and the effective participation of all workers in the political, economic and social organisation of the country.\\" Article 29, under Title II, \\"Ethical and Social Relations\\", reads: \\"The Republic recognises the rights of the family as a natural society founded on matrimony.\\" The second clause establishes the equality between spouses: \\"Matrimony is based on the moral and legal equality of the spouses within the limits laid down by law to guarantee the unity of the family.\\" Another article of fundamental importance here is article 136, under Title VI, \\"Constitutional Guarantees - Section I - The Constitutional Court\\", reading as follows: \\"When the Court declares the constitutional illegitimacy of a law or enactment having the force of law, the law ceases to have effect from the day following the publication of the decision.\\" Moreover, relating to this article, still with pertinence to citizenship, the second clause is very important: \\"The decision of the Court shall be published and communicated to the Houses and to the regional councils concerned, so that, wherever they deem it necessary, they shall act in conformity with constitutional procedures.\\" Decisions of the Constitutional Court and laws enacted in consequence In summary, law 555 of 1912 has been superseded by new laws and rulings so that: * The child born on or after 1 January 1948 to an Italian man or woman is to be considered Italian by birth (except as provided in some treaties). * An Italian woman's marriage to an alien, or her husband's loss of Italian citizenship, has not caused the woman's Italian citizenship to change if the marriage or husband's naturalisation came on or after 1 January 1948. If the same event were prior to 1 January 1948, the Italian consulates and municipalities may not deem her citizenship uninterrupted. In the latter case, the possibility remains that the matter of her continued holding of Italian citizenship will be confirmed in court. * All minor children of at least one Italian citizen parent, including an adoptive parent, as of the date 27 April 1983 who did not already have Italian citizenship received Italian citizenship on this date. * Also beginning on 27 April 1983, the Italian law ceased to prescribe automatic Italian citizenship for foreign women marrying Italian citizen husbands. =Decision no. 87 of 1975= This decision, in summary, finds that it is unconstitutional for women to be deprived of their Italian citizenship in the event that they acquired a new citizenship automatically by marriage. Italy has officially expressed that the benefit of this decision extends retroactively to marriages as early as 1 January 1948. The constitution of the Republic stayed unimplemented, in the matter of citizenship, from the time of its enactment until the year 1983. Notwithstanding the equality determined by articles 3 and 29 of the constitution, the Parliament did not put forth any law modifying the absence of code law which would allow the child of an Italian citizen mother and an alien father to have Italian citizenship by jus sanguinis. The decision rendered on 9 April 1975, number 87, by the Constitutional Court, declared the unconstitutionality of article 10, third paragraph, in the part which foresaw a woman's loss of citizenship independently from her free will. Among the essential points of the decision, it was pointed out that article 10 was inspired by the very widespread concept in 1912 that women were legally inferior to men, and as individuals, did not have full legal capacity. Such a concept was not represented by, and moreover was in disagreement with, the principles of the constitution. In addition, the law, by stipulating a loss of citizenship reserved exclusively for women, undoubtedly created an unjust and irrational disparity in treatment between spouses, especially if the will of the woman was not questioned or if the loss of citizenship occurred contrarily to her intentions. =Law no. 151 of 1975= In summary, this law impacts citizenship by confirming decision 87 of 1975 for marriages happening after its entry into effect, and authorizing women who lost the Italian citizenship automatically by receiving a new citizenship as a consequence of marriage to reacquire it with a petition. While this law did not state the capability of decision 87/1975 to retroact, the decision's accepted retroactive application back as far as 1 January 1948 is on the merit of the constitution. In the larger picture, law 151 of 1975 was an extensive remodeling of family law in Italy. As a result of the finding of unconstitutionality in decision 87/1975, within the scope of Italy's reform of family law in 1975, article 219 was introduced into law 151 of 1975 which sanctioned for women the \\"reacquisition\\" (more properly, recognition) of citizenship. Article 219 reads: \\"The woman who, by effect of marriage to an alien or because of a change in citizenship on the part of her husband, has lost the Italian citizenship before the entry of this law into effect, may reacquire it with a declaration made before the competent authority in article 36 on the provisions of implementing the civil code. Every rule of the law 555 of 13 June 1912 which is incompatible with the provisions of this present law stands repealed.\\" The term \\"reacquisition\\" appears improper inasmuch as the Constitutional Court's decision pronounced that the citizenship was never lost by the women concerned, and that there was never a willingness to this end on their part, and thus the term \\"recognition\\" seems more proper academically and legally. =Decision no. 30 of 1983= Decision number 30 of 1983 is the finding that transmitting Italian citizenship by birth is a constitutional right of women, and the decision retroacts for births beginning as early as 1 January 1948. The mother must have been holding Italian citizenship when the child was born for the transmission to occur as a consequence of this rule. Decision number 30 was pronounced on 28 January 1983, deposited in chancellery on 9 February 1983, and published in \\"Official Gazette\\" number 46 on 16 February 1983. The question of unconstitutionality of article 1 of law 555 of 1912 was posed \\"where it does not foresee that the child of an Italian citizen mother having kept her citizenship even after her marriage to a foreigner, also has Italian citizenship\\". The decision determined that the first clause of article 1 of this law was in clear contrast with the constitution's articles 3 (first paragraph‚Äîequality before the law without regard to sex, etc.) and 29 (second paragraph‚Äîmoral and juridical parity between spouses). The Constitutional Court not only declared article 1 of law 555 of 13 June 1912 unconstitutional where it did not foresee the Italian citizenship of the child of an Italian citizen mother; but also article 2 of the same law where it sanctions a child's acquisition of a mother's citizenship only in limited cases, since thereafter those limitations were lifted and mothers could generally pass Italian citizenship to their children. =Opinion no. 105 of 1983 from the State Council= The opinion number 105 of 15 April 1983; given by the State Council, Section V, in a consultative session; determined that by effect of Decision 30 of 1983 by the Constitutional Court, the individuals born to an Italian citizen mother only as far back as 1 January 1948 could be considered Italian citizens, on the premise that the effectiveness of the decision could not retroact further than the moment when the contradiction between the old law and the new constitution emerged, which was 1 January 1948, the date of the constitution's entry into effect. =Law no. 123 of 1983= This law granted automatic Italian citizenship to minor children (under age 18) of at least one parent holding Italian citizenship on its entry date into effect (27 April 1983). The law ended the practice of granting automatic citizenship to women by marriage. The law gave an obligation to dual citizens to opt for a single citizenship while 18 years of age. On 21 April 1983, law number 123 was passed, which established that all minor children of an Italian citizen father or mother, including an adoptive parent, were Italian citizens by birth. In the case of dual citizenship, the child was required to select a single citizenship within one year after reaching the age of majority (article 5) ‚Äî unless the non-Italian citizenship was acquired through birth in a jus soli country, according to a 1990 Council of State opinion. The law is understood to have extended Italian citizenship to all minor children of Italian citizens at the moment of the law's entry into effect, even if the children were adopted. The same law repeals the prior rule prescribing automatic acquisition of Italian citizenship jure matrimonis by alien women who contracted marriage with an Italian citizen husband. Thus since the date of entry into force (27 April), the equality of foreign spouses before the Italian law was instituted, and the cardinal principle of acquisition of citizenship through one's expression of free will was reasserted. Loss of Italian citizenship under law no. 123 of 1983 With the entry of law 123 of 1983 into effect on 27 April 1983, Italy instituted a requirement of selecting a single citizenship among those Italians with multiple citizenship reaching the age of majority on or after 27 April 1983. The selection was due within one year. If the selection of Italian citizenship was not made, there was the potential for the Italian citizenship to be lost. The government's orientation toward this rule is that those dual citizens whose foreign nationality came by birth in states attributing their jus soli citizenship to them were exempt from the requirement, because this law did not repeal the still effective article 7 of law 555 of 1912. The government has also clarified that children born to Italian mothers foreign naturalised as an automatic result of a marriage contracted on or after 1 January 1948 are also exempt from the requirement. The requirement was repealed on 18 May 1986, and so it was given only to people born between 27 April 1965 and 17 May 1967. Between 18 May 1986 and 14 August 1994, people subject to the requirement were entitled to make belated selections of Italian citizenship, or amend previously made selections of foreign citizenship. Italy's current citizenship laws  =Law no. 91 of 1992= Law number 91, passed on 5 February 1992, establishes that the following persons are citizens by birth: :a) The child of a citizen father or mother. :b) Whoever is born within the Republic's territory if both parents are stateless or unknown, or if the child's citizenship does not follow that of the parents, pursuant to the law of their country. (article 1, first paragraph). By paragraph 2, foundlings recovered in Italy are citizens by birth if it cannot be proven that these persons are in possession of another citizenship. Article 3 partially restates the text contained in article 5 of law 123 of 1983 where it establishes that an adoptive child of an Italian citizen is Italian, even if the child is of foreign origin, and even if the child was born before the passing of the law. It has expressly established retroactivity in this situation. This is notwithstanding the fact that the law otherwise precludes its own retroactive application in article 20, which provides that \\"...except as expressly provided, the citizenship status acquired prior to the present law is not altered, unless by events after its date of entry into force.\\" This provision, in concert with opinion number 105 of 15 April 1983, has provided that children of an Italian citizen mother and an alien father born before 1 January 1948 (date of the republican constitution's entry into force) remain subject to the old law 555 of 13 June 1912, despite the Constitutional Court's pronouncement of unconstitutionality in decision 30 of 1983. Additionally law 91 of 1992 allows the possession of multiple citizenship, previously prohibited in article 5 of law 123 of 1983 for those Italians acquiring a new citizenship. This allowance of keeping Italian citizenship is not applicable in all cases of an Italian acquiring foreign citizenship, because Italy has maintained treaties with some states to the effect that an Italian naturalising in one of those states could lose Italian citizenship automatically. Law 91 of 1992 leaves those agreements in effect. (article 26) Furthermore, law 91 of 1992 rules that persons who obtain Italian citizenship do not need to renounce to their earlier citizenship, provided the dual nationality is also permitted by the other concerned state. Laws coming after 1992 have altered access to citizenship extending it to some categories of citizens who for historical reasons, in connection with war events, were still excluded. These more recent laws follow: 1) Law no. 379 of 14 December 2000 \\"Provisions for the recognition of Italian citizenship for the persons born and resident in the territories belonging to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and their descendants\\". (Published in the Official Gazette no. 295 on 19 December 2000) Law 379/2000 contained provisions to recognize Italian citizenship for those persons who were born and residing in Italy's annexed territories from the Austro-Hungarian Empire prior to 15 July 1920. The recognition was available also to their descendants. Recognition of Italian citizenship under law 379/2000 was given only to applicants, and the provisions expired in December 2010. 2) Law no. 124 of March 2006 \\"Changes to law number 91 of 5 February 1992 concerning the recognition of Italian citizenship for nationals of Istria, Fiume, and Dalmatia and their descendants\\". (Published in the Official Gazette no. 73 on 28 March 2006) Law 124/2006 allows individuals who were Italian citizens residing in territories ceded from Italy to Yugoslavia at the time of their cession to reclaim Italian citizen status. It gives the ability to claim Italian citizen status to those people with knowledge of Italian language and culture who are lineal descendants of the eligible persons who were residing in those regions. In more recent times, reforms to the citizenship law favouring immigrants from outside of the European Union were discussed. These immigrants currently may apply for citizenship after the completion of ten years of residency in the territory of the republic. Many aspects remain unresolved, such as the recognition of citizenship status for descendants of an Italian woman who before 1948 had married a foreign husband and lost Italian citizenship on account of her marriage. These cases have created a dual system for recognition of citizenship: While the descendants by a paternal line have no impediments to the recognition of their citizenship status‚Äîeven if the ascendant emigrated in 1860 (before Italy formed a state); the descendants of an Italian woman‚Äîeven if she was from the same family‚Äîtoday still find themselves precluded from reacquiring Italian citizenship, and their only possible remedy is to appear before an Italian judge. Transmission of Italian citizenship along maternal lines =Decision no. 4466 of 2009 from the Court of Cassation (final court of appeals)= The United Sections, reversing its position in decision number 3331 of 2004, has established that, by effect of decisions 87 of 1975 and 30 of 1983, the right to Italian citizenship status should be recognised for the applicant who was born abroad to the son of an Italian woman married to an alien within the effective period of law 555 of 1912 who was in consequence of her marriage deprived of Italian citizenship. Though partaking of the existing principle of unconstitutionality, according to which the pronouncement of unconstitutionality of the pre-constitutional rules produces effects only upon the relations and situations not yet concluded as of the date 1 January 1948, not being capable of retroacting earlier than the constitution's entry into force; the Court affirms that the right of citizenship, since it is a permanent and inviolable status except where it is renounced on the part of the petitioner, is justifiable at any time (even in the case of the prior death of the ascendant or parent of whomever derives the recognition) because of the enduring nature, even after the entry into force of the constitution, of an illegitimate privation due to the discriminatory rules pronounced unconstitutional. Effects of decision no. 4466 of 2009 from the Court of Cassation on jurisprudence After this 2009 decision, the judges in the Court of Rome (Tribunale di Roma) awarded, in more than 500 cases, Italian citizenship to the descendants of a female Italian citizen, born before 1948; and to the descendants of an Italian woman who had married a non-Italian citizen before 1948. As the Italian Parliament has not coded this decision from Cassation into law, it is not possible for these descendants to obtain jus sanguinis citizenship, making the pertinent application before a consulate or a competent office of vital and civil records in Italian municipalities. For these kind of descendants of Italian women the possibility of receiving recognition of Italian citizenship therefore only remains by making a case in the Italian Court. Travel freedom of Italian citizens Visa requirements for Italian citizens Visa requirements for Italian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Italy. In 2017, Italian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 174 countries and territories, ranking the Italian passport 3rd in terms of travel freedom (tied with American, Danish, Finnish and Spanish passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index. Additionally, the World Tourism Organization also published a report on 15 January 2016 ranking the Italian passport 1st in the world (tied with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Singapore and the United Kingdom) in terms of travel freedom, with the mobility index of 160 (out of 215 with no visa weighted by 1, visa on arrival weighted by 0.7, eVisa by 0.5 and traditional visa weighted by 0). The Italian nationality is ranked eighth, together with Finland, in Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well. Dual citizenship According to Italian law, multiple citizenship is explicitly permitted under certain conditions if acquired on or after 16 August 1992. (Prior to that date, Italian citizens with jus soli citizenship elsewhere could keep their dual citizenship perpetually, but Italian citizenship was generally lost if a new citizenship was acquired, and the possibility of its loss through a new citizenship acquisition was subject to some exceptions.) Those who acquired another citizenship after that date but before 23 January 2001 had three months to inform their local records office or the Italian consulate in their country of residence. Failure to do so carried a fine. Those who acquired another citizenship on or after 23 January 2001 could send an auto-declaration of acquisition of a foreign citizenship by post to the Italian consulate in their country of residence. On or after 31 March 2001, notification of any kind is no longer necessary. Citizenship of the European Union Because Italy forms part of the European Union, Italian citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Italian embassy, Italian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Italian citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Citizenship fee Since 2014 all applications by people aged 18 or over asking for recognition of Italian citizenship are subject to a payment of a ‚Ç¨300 fee (Law n. 66, April 24, 2014 and Law n. 89, June 23, 2014). This was passed by the Renzi Cabinet led by Matteo Renzi.

He is most famous for the songs \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" and \\"Lo! Here the Gentle Lark.\\" He was the composer or arranger of some 120 dramatic works, including 80 operas, light operas, cantatas, and ballets. Bishop was Knighted in 1842. Bishop worked for all the major theatres of London in his era ‚Äî including the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Vauxhall Gardens and the Haymarket Theatre, and was Professor of Music at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford. His second wife was the noted soprano Anna Bishop, who scandalised British society by leaving him and conducting an open liaison with the harpist Nicolas-Charles Bochsa until the latter's death in Sydney. Life Bishop was born in London, where his father was a watchmaker and haberdasher. At the age of 13, Bishop left full-time education and worked as a music-publisher with his cousin. After training as a jockey at Newmarket, he took some lessons in harmony from Francisco Bianchi in London. In 1804 he wrote the music to a piece called \\"Angelina\\", which was performed at Margate. After his second success on the stage with The Maniac (1810), Bishop became music director of Covent Garden for the next 14 years.Geoffrey Brace: \\"Bishop, Henry Rowley\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part, vol. 2 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 1999), cc. 1686. In 1813, he was a founding member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. In 1825 Bishop was induced by Robert Elliston to transfer his services from Covent Garden to the rival house in Drury Lane, for which he wrote, among others, the opera Aladdin, based on the story from 1001 Nights. It was intended to compete with Weber's Oberon, commissioned by the other house. Aladdin failed, and Bishop's career as an operatic composer came to an end. He did, however, rework operas by other composers. An 1827 Covent Garden playbill records a performance of the Marriage of Figaro with \\"The Overture and Music selected chiefly from Mozart's operas ‚Äì the new music by Mr Bishop\\". It included an aria called Follow, follow o'er the mountain, sung by Miss Paton. In 1841 he was appointed Reid Professor of Music in the University of Edinburgh, but resigned the office in 1843. In 1848 he became Heather Professor of Music at the University of Oxford, succeeding William Crotch, until 1853. According to William Denslow, Bishop was a freemason. Bishop was knighted in 1842. Bishop's later years were clouded by scandal. He had married his second wife, the singer Ann Rivi√®re, in 1831. She was twenty- three years younger than he, and they had three children.Norman Gilliland, Grace Notes for a Year: Stories of Hope, Humor and Hubris From the World of Classical Music (Madison, Wisconsin: NEMO Productions, 2002), p. 9. In 1839, Anna Bishop (as she was now known) abandoned her husband and three children to run off with her lover and accompanist, the harpist and composer Nicolas- Charles Bochsa. They left England to give concert tours abroad until Bochsa died in Sydney, Australia, in 1856. Anna Bishop sang on every continent and was the most widely travelled opera singer of the 19th century. Sir Henry Bishop died in poverty in London, although he had a substantial income during his lifetime. He is buried in East Finchley Cemetery in north London. Music Bishop's \\"operas\\" were written in a style and format that satisfied the audiences of his day. They have more in common with the earlier, native English ballad opera genre, or with modern musicals, than the classical opera of continental Europe with full recitatives. His first opera, The Circassian's Bride (1809), had one performance at Drury Lane before the theatre burned down and the score was lost. Bishop reconstructed it from memory.Brace, in MGG (1999), as above. Between 1816 and 1828, Bishop composed the music for a series of Shakespearean operas staged by Frederic Reynolds. But these, and the numerous works, operas, burlettas, cantatas, incidental music etc. which he wrote are mostly forgotten. Even his limited partnering with various composers including Joseph Edwards Carpenter, Thomas Simpson Cooke and Stephen Glover are often overlooked. The year 1816 also saw the composition of a string quartet in C minor. This work is also mentioned in Corder. His most successful operas were The Virgin of the Sun (1812), The Miller and his Men (1813), Guy Mannering (1816), and Clari, or the Maid of Milan (1823). Clari, with a libretto by the American John Howard Payne, included the song Home! Sweet Home!, which became enormously popular. In 1852 Bishop 'relaunched' the song as a parlour ballad. It was popular in the United States throughout the American Civil War and after. According to music historian Anne Gilchrist: 'If a postscript by another hand may follow Mr. Frank Kidson's* most illuminating true story of the origin of Home, Sweet Home,' in the November number of THE CHOIR, musical readers may perhaps be interested to learn that the melody was vastly improved by compression in Sir Henry Bishop's later edition of it (the one now familiar). The original so-called 'Sicilian Air,' which Bishop - as Mr. Kidson has told - confessed to having written himself for lack of the required specimen of Sicilian melody, is a tedious affair, with much repetition. The first two bars (now counted as four) of the melody are sung, with the variation of a single note, four times, and after two bars of something a little different, a fifth time. It is as if one sang the strain, ‚Äò ‚ÄôMid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, Be it never so humble, there's no place like home,‚Äô twice over, then two bars of variation, then the music of the above two lines once more. There is as yet no refrain of 'Home, sweet home,' but instead, the strain belonging to 'There's no place like home, there's no place like home' is sung (except for one note) twice over, as a conclusion. The truth as it appears to me is that Bishop's notion of Sicilian music was exclusively derived from the hymn-tune 'Sicilian Mariners,' whose character he imitated as closely as prudence would allow.' www.tradsong.org/Home%20Sweet%20Home%20-%20Gilchrist.pdf Also of note is Bishop's 1819 musical comedy adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, which included the popular coloratura soprano aria \\"Lo!

Beaches Facing north on Elliot's Beach in Besant Nagar. The Marina Beach is the country's longest urban beach, and its 13-km length is often subdivided into more manageable units. The northern part of the beach (immediately south of the Cooum River) is simply known as the Marina and is followed by the Santhome beach, which lies north of the Adyar river estuary. Located on the Marina Beach is the lighthouse of Chennai. South of the Adyar, the first section is called Elliot's Beach or Besant Nagar beach and is followed by the Tiruvanmiyur beach, the Kottivakkam beach and the Neelangarai beach. The beach is visited by most people in the late afternoon and evening, when the sea breeze effect is at its strongest. It is also favoured by joggers at dawn. Before the Madras Harbour was built, the Marina beach was just a strip of mud, teeming with mudskippers.  Flora and fauna  The earliest-known documentation of plants in the erstwhile Madras dates to 1853, in a book titled Hortus Madraspatensis by the then conservator of forests, Hugh Cleghorn. The green cover in the city remains at 4%, while the state has 19.65% of forest cover.With help from students, tree census begins in Chennai The Guindy National Park in the south of the city is the country's smallest national park, with an area of 2.76 km2. This is also a rare national park that is located completely inside a large city. It has a scrub forest and the animals found here include chital and black buck, many species of snakes, birds, insects, and the like.. The adjoining IIT campus also holds many black bucks, spotted deers, bonnet monkeys, palm civets, mongoose, many species of birds, snakes, insects, and the like. A small deer population also thrives in the nearby Anna University campus. The Guindy National Park and the adjoining IIT Madras campus play a vital role in cleaning the city's atmosphere and is several degrees cooler than the city in summer. The Adyar Eco Park, also known as Tholkappia Poonga, is set up by the Government of Tamil Nadu to restore and protect the fragile ecosystem of Adyar estuary and creek. It is developed in a way to promote eco-tourism. The Arignar Anna Zoological Park (better known as Vandalur Zoo) is located southwest of the city and covers an area of 5.1 km2. The zoo was formerly located in Park Town under the name \\"Madras Zoo\\" and was the oldest zoo in the country (established 1854 ). It was moved to its current suburban location in 1980. It has about eighty species on display and includes a lion safari and two aviaries. The southern stretches of the beach, from Tiruvanmiyur to Neelangarai, are favoured by the endangered olive ridley turtles to lay their eggs every winter, as are other beaches in Tamil Nadu and Odisha. At that time, many conservation volunteers work on the beach during the night to protect the eggs or to remove them to a hatchery. Hatchlings are usually released to the sea in March or April. South of the city, along the East Coast Road, is the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, which hosts several fresh-water and salt-water crocodiles, alligators, gharials, and also turtles and snakes. It is considered an important institute for herpetological research and performs services such as snake venom extraction for preparing antidotes. A large number of cattle egrets, pond herons and other waterbirds can be seen in the rivers of Cooum and Adyar. In addition, the Government of India has plans to classify the Adyar Estuary into a protected eco-system. About 75,000 birds migrate to Chennai every year.30 rare grey headed Lapwings spotted at Pallikaranai marsh Marshy wetlands such as Pallikaranai also play host to a number of migratory birds during the monsoon and winter. It is one of the prioritized wetlands of Tamil Nadu.Wetlands Unfortunately, this wetland is being degraded by pollution and garbage dumping and is converted into housing colonies, railway terminus, institutions, and the like with utter disregard for its wildlife and ecosystem values. However, steps are being taken to restore this marshland. Nearly half of the native plant species in the city's wetlands have disappeared in recent years. The city, which had 85 percent of its area covered with aquatic plants until the 1970s, now has only 25 percent of its area covered with such plants. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded in the city and its neighbourhood by members of Madras Naturalists' Society since its inception in 1978. The society aims at raising awareness among the citizens, particularly students, on the importance of wildlife in the city and conservation. They have regular meetings every month and publish monthly newsletter and a quarterly journal Blackbuck. They also organise outings and camps for members. There were records of wild cats such as tiger, leopard, panther and even cheetahs roaming in the suburbs of Chennai, in as late as 1980s. Foxes, jackals, chital (spotted deer), black buck, monkeys and other rare species of animals can still be spotted in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.  Arignar Anna Zoological Park  White tiger at Anna Zoological Park Chennai has the distinction of having the first zoo in India as early as 1855. The first zoo was located in Moore Market, near Ripon Building. With increasing traffic noise, and the demand for People's Park land for other services, it was decided in 1976 the zoo had to shifted.https://sriramv.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/lost-landmarks-of-chennai- corporation-zoo/ This was shifted to the Vandalur Reserve Forest in 1979 by the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. The zoo is spread over 510 ha. of dry evergreen forests with gentle undulating terrain open wet and dryland type enclosures, specially developed to simulate natural environment for the animals. After the zoo was inaugurated in 1985, it has undergone improvements, with new animals making their home and breeding. Today there are some 81 enclosures ‚Äì six types of deer: barking deer, sambar, blackbuck, nilgai, sangai, hog deer. A number of monkey species from Nilgiri langur to the endangered lion-tailed macaque, baboon, Hanuman langur and leaf-capped langur, wolf, jackal, hyena, llama, otter, an aviary for Vedantangal birds and another for Point Calimere birds, then enclosures for the higher carnivores like the tiger, lion, panther, and jaguar, as well as grazers such as elephants, giraffes and camels. Near every enclosure, there are stone boards talking about the zoological name, its feeding, mating and breeding habits and seasons apart from the place where it is endemic. And trees have placards with their botanical names and other details. Zoo keepers feeding the elephants and the calves at Anna Zoological Park A library is open to public on Mondays and Fridays. The zoo is open 6 days a week from 9-6 PM though ticket sales close an hour earlier, Tuesday being a holiday. For those of you who may find the long trek inside a bit arduous, you can ride on the battery vehicles plying inside, for a fee. Environmental awareness and education form an integral part of the zoo's activities. They have launched education programmes for students (pre-primary, primary and higher secondary and college) and teachers and other visitors. And now they are having a zoo volunteer program in which anyone who wants to work inside the place can apply. Apart from this, members of the \`Student zoo club‚Äô get valuable experience as they get exposed to adventure while getting educated about wildlife management, conservation, animal behaviour, their habitats, ecosystems, evolution, animal adaptations, reproduction, nutrition, animal housing and husbandry. The membership is open for 2 years for which they also get a certificate. The club currently has about 150 members.

Marija Gimbutas assumed an Indo- European origin, though this is contradicted by newer genetic studies that show a connection to the earlier wave of Neolithic farmers rather than to invaders from the southern Russian steppes.Tassi, F. et al. (2017). Genome diversity in the Neolithic Globular Amphorae culture and the spread of Indo- European languages. Proc. R. Soc. B 284:20171540. https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.1540 The GAC preceded the Corded Ware culture in its central area. Somewhat to the south and west, it was bordered by the Baden culture. To the northeast was the Narva culture. It occupied much of the same area as the earlier Funnelbeaker culture. The name was coined by Gustaf Kossinna because of the characteristic pottery, globular-shaped pots with two to four handles. {align=right Globular Amphora } Extent The Globular Amphora culture was located in an area defined by the Elbe catchment on the west and that of the Vistula on the east, extending southwards to the middle Dniester and eastwards to reach the Dnieper. West of the Elbe, some globular amphorae are found in megalithic graves. The GAC finds in the steppe area are normally attributed to a rather late expansion between 2950 and 2350 cal. BC from a centre in Wolhynia and Podolia. Economy The economy was based on raising a variety of livestock, pigs particularly in its earlier phase, in distinction to the Funnelbeaker culture's preference for cattle. Settlements are sparse, and these normally just contain small clusters pits. No convincing house-plans have yet been excavated. It is suggested that some of these settlements were not year-round, or may have been temporary. Burials Globular Amphora tomb The GAC is primarily known from its burials. Inhumation was in a pit or cist. A variety of grave offerings were left, including animal parts (such as a pig's jaw) or even whole animals, e.g., oxen. Grave gifts include the typical globular amphorae and stone axes. There are also cattle-burials, often in pairs, accompanied by grave gifts. There are also secondary burials in Megalithic graves. Interpretation The inclusion of animals in the grave is seen as an intrusive cultural element by Marija Gimbutas. The practice of suttee, hypothesized by Gimbutas is also seen as a highly intrusive cultural element. The supporters of the Kurgan hypothesis point to these distinctive burial practices and state this may represent one of the earliest migrations of Indo-Europeans into Central Europe. In this context and given its area of occupation, this culture has been claimed as the underlying culture of a Germanic-Baltic-Slavic continuum.J. P. Mallory and D. Q. Adams, Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, London and Chicago, 1997., \\"Globular Amphora culture\\" Genetics In a 2017 genetic study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the fifteen samples of mtDNA was extracted. The majority of the samples belonged to subclades of U and Haplogroup H (mtDNA), while J, W and K was also detected. The remains were found to closely related to Neolithic European farmers and Western Hunter-Gatherers, with little genetic relations to the Yamnaya culture in the east. The authors of the study suggested that the Globulara Amphora culture was non-Indo-European-speaking, but with cultural influences from Yamnaya. A February 2018 study published in Nature included an analysis of eight males of the Globular Amphora culture. Three of them carried haplogroup I2a2a1b and a subclade of it; two carried I2a2; one carried I2; one carried BT and one carried CT. In a 2019 genetic study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 15 skeletons from the Koszyce mass grave in southern Poland, which is ascribed to the Globular Amphora culture. The individuals were all shown to be members of an extended family, and to have been buried with great care by someone who knew them very well. Most of them were female and children. All had been executed by a violent blow to the head, perhaps by invading Corded Ware groups. The older males of the family are missing from the grave, suggesting that they were away or had fled. Of the eight samples of Y-DNA extracted, all were found to belong to I2a-L801. The fifteen samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to various subclades of T, H, J, K, HV. The skeletons were determined to have about 70% Neolithic farmer ancestry and 30% Western Hunter-Gatherer ancestry, meaning they had no steppe ancestry. The archaeological and genetic evidence collected from the grave indicated that the Globular Amphora culture was patriarchal and kinship-oriented, which appears to have been the norm for Late Neolithic communities in Central Europe.

He was the husband of Eleanor White, whom he married at St Bride's ChurchSt Bride's: American Connections in London, and the father of Virginia Dare, the first English child born in America. The details of Dare's death are still unknown. Personal life He was the father of Virginia Dare, whose birth on August 18, 1587, was the first recorded to English parents on the continent of North America. Dare was a London tiler and bricklayer.Miller (2000), p. 27 Very little else is known of Dare other than the birth of his child, but his father-in-law, John White, was appointed Governor during the second attempt to settle Sir Walter Raleigh's Roanoke colony in 1587. White also accompanied the 1585 to 1586 expedition, led by Richard Grenville at sea and Ralph Lane on land. The illustrations White made during his stay at Roanoke were published in 1590 along with Thomas Harriet's \\"A Brief and True Report\\". English descendants According to the Index to Acts of Administration in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury 1596 - 1608, Ananias had a son by the name of John who was placed into the custody of a John Nokes of London in April 1594 and \\"decreed\\" his son in June 1597. Both John Nokes and a certain Robert Satchfield had originally applied to the Canterbury Court for the guardianship in 1594. This Robert Satchfield may be the same Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset. The following is an exact quote from the abbreviated entry: :Dare, Ananias, St. Bride, Lond. To Jn. Nokes, k., dur. min. of Jn. D., s. (by Decree), (prev. Gnt. Apr 1594, p. 95), Jun 1597, p. 213 ::Translation ... \\"dur. min.\\" means: \\"during minority\\" and is usually written: \\"durante minore aetate\\"; and basically concerns the \\"minor person of\\", and then the name. \\"Aetate\\", which means \\"age\\", is understood and can, as in this case, subtly refer to a person's estate. Such \\"double talk\\" is typical in Latin with things alluded to having an outward meaning as well as an additional \\"subtle\\" meaning \\"reserved\\" for those of an ominous \\"inner circle\\". So that immediately the children of the missing persons from the Colony were placed into respective guardianships, and all of them were eventually declared dead by the Prerogative or other appropriate court. The external link below indicates that Ananias and his wife were married in the same church as that mentioned in the quote above, St Bride's, London, and a carving of Virginia Dare's bust is situated above the font of the church. In Frances Rose-Troup, John White, the Patriarch of Dorchester and the Founder of Massachusetts (1930), the author mentions John White who appears to be the son of the same above-mentioned John White. There, the author also gives mention of a certain George Dier (1579-1672) and his relationship to the Rev. John White. In Charles Edward Banks, The Planters of the Commonwealth (1930, 1st edition) there is an important mention of a vessel by the name of Mary & John that the same above-mentioned Rev. John White sponsored from Plymouth, England to Dorchester on March 20, 1630. On that vessel's ship's list are a mention of a John Drake, close relation of Sir Francis Drake, as well as that of a George Dyer - the same George Dier that is mentioned in Rose-Troup. Roanoke Colony In her 2000 book Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony, anthropologist Lee Miller speculates that Ananias Dare and the other members of the Roanoke Colony were religious Separatists who left England at a time when the political climate in England was dangerous for such religious dissidents. She suggests that this might be why the colonists, two of whom were pregnant women and several of whom were parents with young children, were willing to undertake the dangerous journey to Roanoke Island, Virginia with low supplies and at a time England was on the verge of war with Spain. The colonists, including the women, signed a petition urging White to return to England for supplies, even though he was reluctant to leave his daughter and granddaughter. Miller suggests that this democratic action would have been typical of a religious Separatist group.Miller (2000), p. 51 John White left the group on August 27, 1587, and returned three years later, only to find the colony deserted. =Historical explanations= John Smith and other members of the Jamestown Colony sought information about the fate of the colonists in 1607. One report indicated that the Lost Colonists took refuge with friendly Chesapeake Indians, but Chief Powhatan claimed his tribe had attacked the group and killed most of the colonists. Powhatan showed Smith certain artifacts he said had belonged to the colonists, including a musket barrel and a brass mortar. The Jamestown Colony received reports of some survivors of the Lost Colony and sent out search parties, but none were successful. Eventually they determined they were all dead.THE LOST COLONY: Roanoke Island, NC ~ Packet by Eric Hause: Articles about the Outer Banks NC and the Mainland However, in her 2000 book Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony, Miller postulated that some of the Lost Colony survivors sought shelter with a neighboring Indian tribe, the Chowanoc, that was attacked by another tribe, identified by the Jamestown Colony as the \\"Mandoag,\\" but whom Miller thinks were actually the Eno, also known as the Wainoke. Survivors were eventually sold into slavery and held captive by differing bands of the Eno tribe, who, Miller wrote, were known slave traders. Miller wrote that English settlers with the Jamestown Colony heard reports in 1609 of the captive Englishmen, but the reports were suppressed because they had no way to rescue the captives and didn't want to panic the Jamestown colonists. William Strachey, a secretary of the Jamestown Colony, wrote in his The History of Travel Into Virginia Britania in 1612 that, at the Indian settlements of Peccarecanick and Ochanahoen, there were reportedly two story houses with stone walls. The Indians supposedly learned how to build them from the Roanoake settlers.Stick (1983), p. 222 There were also reported sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements during the same time period.Miller (2000), p. 250 Strachey wrote in 1612 that four English men, two boys, and one girl had been sighted at the Eno settlement of Ritanoc, under the protection of a chief called Eyanoco. The captives were forced to beat copper. The captives, he reported, had escaped the attack on the other colonists and fled up the Chaonoke river, the present-day Chowan River in Bertie County, North Carolina.Miller (2000), p. 242 =Possible descendants= Miller reports the following: The Chowanoc tribe was eventually absorbed into the Tuscarora. The Eno tribe was also associated with the Shakori tribe and was later absorbed by the Catawba or the Saponi tribes. From the early 17th century to the middle 18th century European colonists reported encounters with gray-eyed American Indians or with Welsh-speaking Indians who claimed descent from the colonists.Miller (2000), pp. 257, 263 In 1669 a Welsh cleric named Morgan Jones was taken captive by the Tuscarora. He feared for his life, but a visiting Doeg Indian war captain spoke to him in Welsh and assured him that he would not be killed. The Doeg warrior ransomed Jones and his party and Jones remained with their tribe for months as a preacher.Miller (2000), p. 257 In 1701, surveyor John Lawson encountered members of the Hatteras tribe living on Roanoke Island who claimed some of their ancestors were white people. Lawson wrote that several of the Hatteras tribesmen had gray eyes.Miller (2000), p. 263 Some present-day American Indian tribes in North Carolina and South Carolina, among them the Coree and the Lumbee tribes, also claim partial descent from surviving Roanoke colonists.

The album was highly anticipated, being the first Self album released on a major label since their debut album, Subliminal Plastic Motives. Production Working with a larger budget now that the band was on DreamWorks Records, the album featured an impressive roster of production credits, including: Richard Dodd, a Grammy-Award winning engineer; Hugh Padgham, a legendary British producer; and Ken Andrews, formerly of the band Failure. The sessions took place at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville, with additional tracking done at The Bennett House in Franklin, TN and Mahaffey's house in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. \\"Uno Song\\" and \\"Suzie Q Sailaway\\" were last minute additions to the album - both had originally been recorded for inclusion on Gizmodgery. Reception The album wasn't well-received upon release, in part due to the delays in its release, but also because of the drastic change in style from its predecessor. Rather than the more rock- oriented approach of the debut, Breakfast with Girls saw lead singer/songwriter Matt Mahaffey focusing on the more experimental sides of his music. The change confused many fans, and the critical response was mixed, with some praising him for his bold, disciplined, do-it-yourself indie aesthetic, while other critics felt the record was too cold and calculated-- something that could only be enjoyed at a distance. Despite the lukewarm reception, many of the band's fans now consider Breakfast with Girls to be Self's masterpiece, citing its quirky songwriting and diversity as reasons. It contains a wide variety of styles ranging from industrial, funk, and hip-hop to blues, jazz, and orchestral pop. The album also contains a few slightly more conventional pop/rock songs. Release In addition to CD, the album was also released on Vinyl with bonus tracks, and as a limited edition CD, which had a full 12 page booklet of artwork done by Brian Botcher. People who pre- ordered the album also received an EP, Brunch, and there was a vinyl release of the album, with the Brunch EP and two other songs added as bonus tracks. Both of these items are now amongst the most highly sought after Self items, though all the bonus tracks are available online as downloads. The album produced one single, the bouncy pop song \\"Meg Ryan\\", but like its parent album it didn't see much success. The song \\"Paint by Numbers\\" was featured in the movie Dead Man on Campus and its soundtrack.

In addition to eleven published books, Engler's writings have appeared in the alternative press and in mainstream publications such as The Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, Ottawa Citizen, and Ecologist. His 2009 book The Black Book of Canadian Foreign Policy was short-listed for the Quebec Writers' Federation Mavis Gallant Prize for Non-Fiction. Biography Engler moved to Montreal to study at Concordia University in the early 2000s, where he was elected a vice president of the Concordia Student Union. He was suspended by the university after the administration said he had been involved in a riot surrounding a visit to campus by then-former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during which a Holocaust survivor and a rabbi were assaulted. Engler's suspension was later made permanent when he violated a ban on political activity imposed by the university in the aftermath of the riot.http://rabble.ca/news/concordia-activist-faces-expulsion Engler regularly attends rallies and demonstrations in Montreal, and coordinates speaking events centered around his books. Activism =Haiti= Engler was critical of Canada's role in the 2004 Haitian coup d'√©tat. He co-authored a report entitled Canada in Haiti: Waging War Against the Poor Majority and helped establish a group called the Canada-Haiti Action Network. Engler presenting Pierre Pettigrew with a copy of the \\"Griffin report on human rights abuses in Haiti\\" In June 2005, Engler interrupted a press conference being held by then- Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Pierre Pettigrew. Engler poured a bottle of cranberry juice onto Pettigrew and said, \\"Pettigrew lies, Haitians die.\\" The juice was meant to represent the blood Engler said was on the hands of the Canadian government due to its alleged involvement in the 2004 coup and subsequent United Nations peacekeeping mission. =Israel= Engler supports the international campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel because of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. Controversy During an unaired appearance on the Canadian Jewish podcast Treyf, Engler asserted that \\"antisemitism is of such insignificance that increasing something so insignificant is not that big a deal...more important to that is the bigger injustice of Palestinian rights,\\" eliciting pointed opposition from the hosts. \\"Short: Antisemitism on the Left with Spencer Sunshine\\", Treyf podcast,, Sep 21, 2016 Engler later wrote that ‚Äúantisemitism may be the most abused term in Canada today‚Äù and called the Jewish community \\"inward looking and affluent...[and] quick to claim victimhood.\\" He expressed concern that \\"only 15%-17% of Jewish Montrealers live in intermarried (or common-law) households.\\" https://dissidentvoice.org/2016/04/anti-semitism-the- most-abused-word-in-canada Critics said Engler's statements promoted antisemitic stereotypes of supposedly disproportionate Jewish wealth or influence.

Sometimes known as Hydon Ball, or Cup Hill, it is now in the care of the National Trust. At its highest point is a large stone seat which was placed there in 1915 as a memorial to Octavia Hill, one of the Trust's founders. It is believed that the term \\"ball\\" refers to a signalling station which once stood at the top of the hill. There is a short poem associated with Hydon's Ball, which may explain its other alternative name: :On Hydon's top there is a cup :And in that cup there is a drop :Pick up the cup, and drink the drop :And place the cup on Hydon's top. Its slopes are planted with a range of tree species, including native oak, rowan, birch and pine.

He is serving three consecutive life sentences for the kidnapping, torture, and murder of William Mueller and his family. His accomplice, Daniel Lewis Lee, was sentenced to death for the murders, and was executed on July 14, 2020. Early life and education Kehoe was born in Orange Park, Florida, United States. He was the oldest of eight sons born to Kirby and Gloria Kehoe, and was named after his father's favorite brand of automobile (Chevrolet). His father had served in the Navy during the Vietnam War. When Kehoe was an infant, his father moved the family to Madison County, North Carolina. In 1985, Kirby moved the family again, this time to near Deep Lake in Stevens County, Washington. Kehoe entered Colville Junior High School as a ninth grader in 1987 where he was an honor student. Incidentally, future serial killer Israel Keyes was a family friend. In 1988, his parents pulled him and his younger brother Cheyne out of public school, and from then on they were home-schooled. Raised with increasingly extreme anti-government and white supremacist beliefs, Kehoe formed a plan to bring down the United States government with his self-styled \\"Aryan People's Republic\\" militia. Kehoe married Karena Gumm and the couple had three children. Kehoe took a second wife, Angie Settle (also known as Angie Murray) in 1993, but the relationship only lasted for 54 days. Crimes In June 1995, Kehoe and an accomplice kidnapped and robbed Malcolm and Jill Friedman, a couple believed to be Jewish, who owned a store at which Kehoe was once employed. =Mueller family murders= In January 1996, Kehoe and another accomplice, Daniel Lewis Lee, left the state of Washington and traveled to Arkansas. On January 11, 1996, they arrived at the home of William Frederick Mueller, a gun dealer who lived near Tilly, Arkansas, and who owned a large collection of weapons, ammunition, and cash. Kehoe and his father had robbed Mueller back in February 1995, and Kehoe expected to find valuable property at the house. Dressed in police raid clothing, the two men tried to enter the home of Mueller, but they were not at home. When the Muellers returned, Lee and Kehoe overpowered and incapacitated Mueller and his wife, Nancy Ann Mueller (n√©e Branch). They then questioned Nancy Mueller's 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Elizabeth Powell, about where they could find the cash, guns, and ammunition. After finding $50,000 in cash, guns, and ammunition, they shot each of the three victims with a stun gun, causing them to pass out. They then placed plastic bags over their heads, and sealed the bags with duct tape, suffocating them to death. There was undisputed evidence that Lee was unwilling to kill Sarah, so Kehoe killed her. They took the victims in Kehoe's vehicle to the Illinois Bayou, where they taped rocks to them and threw each family member into the swamp. The bodies were discovered in Lake Dardanelle near Russellville, Arkansas in late June 1996. Kehoe and his family took the stolen property to a motel in Spokane, Washington, by way of the Christian Identity community of Elohim City, Oklahoma. William Mueller had put some of the stolen firearms into a Federal Firearms License registry as insurance against potential theft. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) used the ID numbers in the registry to trace the stolen firearms to several other men who confirmed they had purchased them in Spokane from Chevie Kehoe and his father Kirby. =1997 shootout= On February 15, 1997, Kehoe and his brother Cheyne were involved in a shootout with an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper, John Harold Harker and a Clinton County Sheriff's Office deputy, Robert Gates, in Wilmington, Ohio. The Highway Patrol trooper had stopped their vehicle, a blue Chevy Suburban, for driving too slowly and erratically on the road and found the license plate and registration had expired; the brothers also failed to produce any driver's licenses. Chevie, the driver, complied with the officer's orders to get out of the car but warned him against touching him when he tried to search him. The deputy noticed the trouble the state trooper was having with Chevie and stopped to help. As one of the officers called for a tow truck to impound the vehicle, Chevie suddenly began to dash back to the vehicle with the officers in pursuit. The officers had pinned Chevie to a patrol car and were trying to subdue him when Cheyne produced a handgun from his passenger seat and opened fire at the officers, allowing Chevie to jump back into the Suburban and escape. Cheyne himself fled into the nearby woods, where police searched unsuccessfully for him for the whole day. Later that day, Chevie was involved in a shootout in an electrical supply company parking lot with two Wilmington police officers, Ofc. Richard \\"Rick\\" Wood and Sgt. Robert \\"Bob\\" Martin. During the second shootout, a passer-by motorist, 56-year-old Frank Marsden was hit in the shoulder. The two shootouts were recorded on both the trooper and the sergeant's dashboard camera in their patrol vehicle and was widely broadcast in the media at the time. Footage of the shootout was first aired in 1997 on FOX's World's Scariest Police Shootouts. Since then it has been shown on television programs such as Most Shocking, Police In Pursuits, World's Most Amazing Videos, and Under Fire. =On the run and arrest= After fleeing from police, Chevie and Cheyne Kehoe traveled secretly with their families through different states before settling in a ranch in Utah. They worked for the local ranch owner for a time, but disputes between the brothers over Chevie's extremist ideology grew bitter and eventually violent, and ultimately Cheyne left, taking his family with him. He subsequently surrendered to local police and directed them and the FBI back to the Utah ranch, where Chevie Kehoe was arrested on June 17, 1997. In federal court Kehoe was charged with: * Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute (18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1962) * Murdering in aid of racketeering (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1959) * Robbery Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1951) Kehoe denies the criminal accusations against him and has filed appeals. His appeals have been denied. Sentencing On February 20, 1998, Kehoe pled guilty in Ohio state court to felonious assault, attempted murder, and carrying a concealed weapon related to a February 15, 1997, shootout in Wilmington, Ohio, with an Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper and a Clinton County sheriff's deputy during a traffic stop resulting from expired tags on his 1977 Chevrolet Suburban. In 1999, Kehoe was convicted in federal court of the January 1996 murders of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife Nancy Mueller, and her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell. He received three sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Kehoe's mother Gloria and his younger brother Cheyne served as prosecution witnesses and testified against him at the trial. However, they both kept the secret until he got caught. Cheyne Kehoe received a 24-year prison sentence for attempted murder and weapons possession due to his role in the Ohio shootout. Kehoe was imprisoned at United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX in Fremont County, Colorado, under Federal Bureau of Prisons register number: #21300-009. In November 2019 he was transferred to United States Penitentiary, Florence High Oklahoma City bombing Kehoe has been accused by his brother Cheyne and a Spokane motel manager of being involved in, or having prior knowledge of, the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. Cheyne claimed to have knowledge of Chevie's involvement in the bombing shortly after he was sentenced for his role in the shootout. The manager of the Shadow motel in Spokane claimed to have seen Chevie with convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh at the motel four to six months prior to the bombing. The manager also claimed that on the morning of the bombing, Chevie showed up to the motel and asked him to put on CNN and became ecstatic when news of the bombing appeared. The manager also claimed that Chevie had told him in the days prior that something big would happen on April 19. Kehoe denied the allegations and the FBI found no evidence that McVeigh had ever travelled to Spokane.

It consists of 100 directly elected members (or deputies) and between 18 and 23 co-opted members who serve five-year terms. Deputies are elected in 17 multi- member constituencies using a party-list proportional representation system in accordance with the D'Hondt method. Political parties and lists of independent candidates must receive over 2% of the vote nationally to gain representation in the National Assembly. History As a country that has been devastated by civil war and persistent ethnic violence since its independence in 1962, Burundi's new constitution (approved in a February 2005 referendum) requires that 60% of the deputies be from the Hutu ethnic group, while the remaining 40% come from the Tutsi ethnic group. In addition, three co-opted members represent the Twa ethnic group. Women must occupy at least 30% of the seats in the National Assembly. Elections to the National Assembly took place on 4 July 2005. The National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) won 59 of the 100 seats filled through direct election. The Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), who won a majority of seats in the previous election held in 1993, won 25 seats. The Union for National Progress (UPRONA) won 10, while the National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD), a breakaway faction of the CNDD-FDD, won 4. The small, predominantly Tutsi Movement for the Rehabilitation of Citizens-Rurenzangemero (MRC-Rurenzangemero), won the remaining 2 seats. An additional 18 members were co-opted to meet the required ethnic and gender quotas. Immacul√©e Nahayo, an ethnic Hutu member of the CNDD-FDD, was elected president of the National Assembly on 16 August 2005.

It is assigned the number 1/7 in the composer's catalogue of works. History Stockhausen regarded Kreuzspiel as his first original composition, as opposed to the style- imitation exercises he did as part of his music studies . According to the composer, it was influenced by Olivier Messiaen's \\"Mode de valeurs et d'intensit√©s\\" (1949) and Karel Goeyvaerts's Sonata for Two Pianos (1950), and is one of the earliest examples of \\"point\\" music. Kreuzspiel was premi√®red at the Darmst√§dter Internationale Ferienkurse in the summer of 1952, conducted by the composer. According to Stockhausen, the performance \\"ended in a scandal\\" . Analysis Kreuzspiel has been analysed in print more often than any other work by Stockhausen, though all but one restrict themselves to just the first of its three stages. Though routinely described (by the composer as well as others) as a \\"serial\\" composition, Kreuzspiel does not employ a referential, recurring twelve-tone ordered set. Rather, it uses constant reordering of twelve-element (linked pitch, duration, dynamic, and‚Äîin the original version‚Äîattack) sets‚Äîa device sometimes called \\"permutational serialism\\" (e.g., ). It also uses a permutational seven-element system to control register . The composition consists of three linked movements, or \\"stages\\". In the first stage, six notes begin in the highest register, and six others begin in the lowest register. These gradually move into the four middle octaves until an equal distribution of pitches throughout the entire range is achieved at the centre of the movement. From that point to the end of the movement, the process is reversed, so that all notes arrive again in the two extreme registers, only the six notes originally in the top are now at the bottom, and vice versa. The second movement carries out a similar formal process, only starting in the middle register, spreading out to all seven octaves, and then contracting again to the middle. The third movement superimposes the first two (; ). Compositional control of these shapes is determined in the first stage through the parameter of duration, while in the second stage the dominant element is pitch .

She was the fourth woman elected to the United States Senate and the tenth woman to serve in the body. She and her husband, Richard L. Neuberger, are regarded as the Senate's first husband-and-wife legislative team. To date, she is the only woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Oregon. Early life Neuberger was born in Cloverdale, Tillamook County, Oregon. She attended public schools, the Oregon College of Education at Monmouth from 1922 to 1924, graduated from the University of Oregon in 1929 with a Bachelor of Arts. She is an alumna of the Delta Zeta sorority. She was selected to Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society in her junior year. She then undertook graduate study at the University of California at Los Angeles from 1936 to 1937. Brown was a teacher in Oregon public schools between 1932 and 1944; in 1937, while teaching in a Portland high school, she met Richard L. Neuberger. The couple married in 1945, after Neuberger completed his service in World War II. Richard Neuberger was subsequently elected to the Oregon State Senate in 1948. Political career Maurine Neuberger entered politics herself in 1950 when she was elected a member of the State House of Representatives and served from 1950 to 1955. In 1952, when she was reelected to the state House and her husband was reelected to the state Senate, she won with more votes than her husband. During this period she was also a member of the board of directors of the American Association for the United Nations. Richard was elected to the United States Senate in 1954. In 1960, Richard died from cancer. Maurine then won a special election on November 8, 1960, as the Democratic candidate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband. Hall S. Lusk had been appointed by the governor to the Senate upon Richard's death. After the election, Maurine completed Richard's remaining term from November 9, 1960, to January 3, 1961. At the same time as the special election, she won the general election for the term commencing January 3, 1961, and ending January 3, 1967; she was not a candidate for reelection in 1966. A 1965 article noted that Governor Mark Hatfield addressed correspondence to the Senator to her married name, Maurine Neuberger-Solomon, with the intention of making her 1964 remarriage an issue in a potential 1966 campaign.Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott, \\"The Allen-Scott Report\\", Kingsport Post (April 5, 1965), p. 2.

They are used in an inverse kinematics chain, in fields including 3D animation or robotics. Joint constraints can be implemented in a number of ways, but the most common method is to limit rotation about the X, Y and Z axis independently. An elbow, for instance, could be represented by limiting rotation on Y and Z axis to 0 degrees, and constraining the X-axis rotation to 130 degrees. To simulate joint constraints more accurately, dot-products can be used with an independent axis to repulse the child bones orientation from the unreachable axis. Limiting the orientation of the child bone to a border of vectors tangent to the surface of the joint, repulsing the child bone away from the border, can also be useful in the precise restriction of shoulder movement.

Other common names include throw-wort, lion's ear, and lion's tail. Lion's tail is also a common name for Leonotis leonurus, and lion's ear, a common name for Leonotis nepetifolia. Originally from Central Asia and southeastern Europe, it is now found worldwide, spread largely due to its use as a herbal remedy. Description Leonurus cardiaca has a squarish stem which is clad in short hairs and is often purplish, especially near the nodes. The opposite leaves have serrated margins and are palmately lobed with long petioles; basal leaves are wedge shaped with three points while the upper leaves have three to five. They are slightly hairy above and greyish beneath. Flowers appear in leaf axils on the upper part of the plant and have three- lobed bracts. The calyx of each flower is bell-shaped and has five lobes. The corolla is irregular, long, fused, long-tubed with two lips. The upper lip is convex and covered with white hairs and the lower lip is three-lobed and downward-curving and spotted with red. The flowers are pink to lilac in colour often with furry lower lips. There are four protruding stamens, two short and two longer, and the fruit is a four-chambered schizocarp. The plant grows to about in height and blooms during July and August. Distribution and habitat Motherwort is probably native to the southeastern part of Europe and central Asia where it has been cultivated since ancient times. Its natural habitat is beside roadsides, in vacant fields, waste ground, rubbish dumps and other disturbed areas. This plant prefers well drained soil and a partly shady location. Introduced to North America as a bee foraging plant and to attract bumble bees, this perennial herb is now considered invasive. It is hardy in USDA climate zones 4‚Äì8. Leonurus cardiaca L. Common motherwort. NRCS PLANTS database. Retrieved 26 February 2016. Folklore Nicholas Culpeper considered motherwort useful for removing melancholy vapors from the heart, improving cheerfulness, and settling the wombs of mothers. In 15th century Europe, motherwort was considered by some herbalists to protect against evil spirits. Chemistry Stachydrine is extracted from the leaves of Motherwort and has demonstrated various bioactivities for the treatment of fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, uterine diseases, brain injuries, and inflammation.Cheng, F., Zhou, Y., Wang, M., Guo, C., Cao, Z., Zhang, R., & Peng, C. (2020). A review of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of stachydrine. Pharmacological Research, 155:104755. The herb contains the alkaloid leonurine. Among other chemical constituents, it also contains stachydrine, bitter iridoid glycosides (leonuride), diterpinoids, flavonoids (including rutin and quercetin), tannins, volatile oils, and vitamin A.

The series originally aired on Home & Garden Television in Canada, and also on several other Alliance Atlantis networks in Canada (including BBC Canada and Slice), as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and on HGTV in the United States. It had previously aired in the US on Discovery Home until that channel was rebranded Planet Green on June 4, 2008. It was once the highest-rated show on the Canadian HGTV (HGTV having once claimed that an episode had received its highest-ever ratings), with shows airing upwards of 20 times a week at the peak of its popularity. It has won the Gemini viewers' choice award, a testament to the popularity of the show in Canada. Originally, Holmes on Homes ran as a series of 30-minute episodes (with one one-hour special Whole House Disaster), but moved to a one-hour format midway through the third season due to popular demand. Several longer specials have aired: the one-hour season finale to the first season, Whole House Disaster; the one- hour Holmes for the Holidays at the end of the third season; the two-hour House to Home season finale for the fourth season; the two-hour specials Out of the Ashes and Holmes Inspection in the fifth season; the two-hour sixth- season episode Pasadena 911; and the two-hour Lien on Me in the final season. The latest episode is available for viewing on HGTV's website. The first five seasons of half-hour and hour long episodes, as well as the \\"Holmes for the Holidays\\" episode, are also available for purchase on DVD. Season seven commenced airing in Australia on 1 October 2008 on the HOW TO Channel and in the UK on 24 March 2009 on Discovery Shed (formerly Discovery Realtime Extra). Premise The show's premise revolves around general contractor Mike Holmes visiting homeowners (initially in the Greater Toronto Area in the earlier seasons, but also to various locales across Canada and the United States, starting with the seventh season) who are in need of help, mainly due to unsatisfactory home renovations performed by hired contractors. A typical episode has homeowners describing their experiences with the previous contractor, including what had caused the original contractor to leave the work incomplete or with substandard work (often under Ontario building codes). Holmes would also go into detail to explain why the work he sees is substandard and needs to be replaced during the repair process. The original contractors are never named on the shows, although an episode of CBC Television's Marketplace has done investigative journalism behind a sixth- season episode and exposed the contractor alleged to have been at fault. Typically, after beginning the repair work, Holmes and his crew of contractors often find that their small repair project has escalated into a larger one due to surprises that they find and are forced to fix; only on rare occasions has the show's crew not been forced to tear everything down and start over. However, in the end, Holmes presents the homeowners with a completely finished place, often with a few extra surprises. Throughout the rebuilding process, Holmes often comments on the professionalism of the people hired for the job or lets other contractors talk about how to build things correctly. On some occasions Holmes has vented out his frustrations with previous contractors' substandard work in front of the camera. Particularly for projects involving new homes, Holmes often criticizes the developers for following minimum code and trying to save as many costs as possible. Several episodes have deviated from this formula: a fourth-season episode explored the issue of mold in the household, and Holmes was brought in to investigate the matter after the homeowner had done some investigative work on their own; a fifth-season episode saw Holmes and crew build a common fence for 52 households, while a sixth-season episode saw Holmes and crew clean up and restore a house that had been rented out, and unknown to the homeowner, turned into a marijuana grow- op. The sixth-season Pasadena 911 two-hour episode also saw Mike and senior contractor Damon Bennett travel to Los Angeles to help out a couple in need after Holmes' own appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Because the show is a television series, costs for the homeowners, who are likely to be strapped for cash due to the previous contractors' mistakes and/or frauds, are kept to a minimum (10% to 20% of the cost of repair). Some contractors hired on the show have even donated time, materials, and labor to help homeowners in need. The remainder of the work is funded by the TV production company, but in some cases, Mike Holmes personally contributes funds towards the repairs.Behind the scenes episode History Holmes was originally hired on Just Ask Jon Eakes, a home improvement show (also on HGTV and formerly in the US on sister network DIY Network) hosted by Jon Eakes, for some behind-the-scenes work. Mike Holmes approached the show's producers Scott Clark McNeil and Michael Quast with an idea for a new kind of home improvement show. Holmes did not intend that he appear on camera, but the producers made this a condition of the deal. Although submissions to be on the show were initially few and far between, with Holmes doing work on small botched jobs early on in the series, the number of submissions quickly ballooned by the show's fourth season. In its last season, the show was directed by The Holmes Group's Vice President Pete Kettlewell, who had worked on the show from the first season where he did the show's audio, produced by The Holmes Group's Vice President Michael Quast, who had been with the show since the fifth season, and also produced by Mike Holmes himself. As a result of the show's popularity, Holmes had been able to start up the Holmes Foundation, a charity organization which helps raise awareness of skilled trades. Construction crew Although Holmes serves as the show's host, he brings with him several other equally skilled contractors who are regulars on the series (although not all appear in all seasons): =Crew= The construction crew in the seventh season is as follows: * Damon Bennett - Damon was introduced (by Shawn) in the fourth season of the series in the episode Window Well to Hell. With the departure of Shawn, Damon became the senior contractor starting in the sixth season. He is also the only series regular other than Mike himself to be part of Pasadena 911. His specialty is carpentry, though he started in bricklaying (having come from a long line of bricklayers) and roofing. * Adam Belanger - Adam is another senior contractor who joined Mike in the fifth season. His specialty is in landscape and concrete work. * Corin Ames - Corin, known affectionately as \\"Pinky\\", was the first female labourer on the show, starting in the fifth season. She had joined the Holmes Crew as an intern, and was famously hired on-air in her first appearance after finishing her required hours. * Mike Holmes Jr. - Mike's son has been seen in parts of the first four seasons, and, after graduating from high school some time between the fourth and fifth seasons (his previous appearances having been part of a co-op term in high school), joined the Holmes Crew as a series regular. * Matt Antonacci - Matt, known affectionately as \\"Hammy\\", joined the Holmes Crew for sporadic appearances in the fifth season, and joined full-time in the sixth season. * Carl Pavlovic - Carl, sometimes known as \\"Carlito\\", became a series regular in the sixth season. * Kate Campbell - Kate is introduced late in the sixth season. * Peter Lundy - Peter is introduced late in the sixth season. * Billy Bell - \\"Uncle Bill\\", Mike's uncle, is the truck driver for the Holmes tool truck (itself introduced in the fifth season to replace a series of trailers). =Former crew= The following is a list of past crew members who have appeared in earlier seasons: * Shawn Morren - Shawn was the site supervisor from the first five seasons of the series. He left after the fifth season. He now has his own company in the Toronto area. Shawn also appeared on episode 208 of Candice Olson's Divine Design. Candice designed the kitchen in his newly purchased home. * Benjamin Green - Benjamin (\\"Bengi\\") was Mike's senior contractor for the first four seasons of the series. Mike and Ben have known each other for much of their careers. * Desmond Hamlyn - Desmond was another contractor who appeared in the first four seasons of the series. * Don Carter - Don, a tile specialist, appeared for the first two seasons of the series (the first as a hired specialist), as well as Holmes for the Holidays. * Micah Morren - Micah, younger brother to Shawn, appears in the fifth season of the series. * Brennan Cavendish - Brennan briefly appeared in the fifth season of the series. * Dan Rapa - Dan, a plumber, was introduced in the fourth season as a hired specialist, and became a series regular in the fifth. He has left the series to continue operating his own business. Several other tradespersons running their own companies also make regular appearances on the series. Home renovation expert Jon Eakes has also appeared as a guest in one episode, and the winners of Handyman Superstar Challenge are invited to make a guest appearance on the show (Jordan MacNab in season 6 and Kevin Howe in season 7).

In part one of this two-part season finale, Mike Holmes comes to the aid of a family in dire straits and begins one of the toughest and biggest jobs of his contracting career. =Season Five= The fifth season saw an overall change in look, due to increased production values (the filming crew, unlike the first four seasons, were equipped with widescreen high-definition cameras, although the show continues to air in standard-definition on HGTV). The season also saw the Holmes crew expand from a few experienced contractors to encompassing younger apprentices as well. # O-fence-ive - A fencing contractor rips off 52 families in a new housing development. Mike and crew bring the neighborhood together. # House Arrest - A planned 3-month renovation becomes a year-and-a-half nightmare. Mike and crew come to the rescue. # Falling Flat - A photographer's backyard studio is plagued with a leaking flat roof after a prolonged build. # Bargain Basement - Mike and crew discover major flaws in a remodeled basement, tear it all out, and make it right. # For Annie - The Holmes Crew arrive to finish a renovation intended for their now-deceased daughter. # Ceiling the Deal - Mike arrives to investigate a job by web-based \\"basement specialists\\" who claimed to work for him. During the inspection, with one hand he pulls down a 150-pound ceiling bulkhead secured with a few screws. The team gut, redesign and build a whole new multi-purpose basement. # Out of the Ashes (Two 1-hour parts) - A previous contractor hired by the homeowners insurance company to repair the home after an electrical fire leaves behind incomplete and substandard work. Mike and crew arrive and, after completely gutting the home, find they must remove asbestos insulation from the basement and do a full toxic-waste remediation caused by leakage from a heating-oil tank left buried in the back yard. # Taking a Bath - The Holmes crew investigates why a pair of homeowners had their bathtubs in their bathrooms replaced three times in quick succession, causing a large mould buildup. # Showing the Cracks - The elderly homeowner called in a trusted contractor to lay a new ceramic tile floor. When the tiles start cracking down the middle in straight lines, Mike and the crew strip it down to the sub-floor and build a new kitchen 'from the ground up'. # Wall of Sound - The Holmes crew investigates why the homeowners could hear their neighbors from across the common wall of a new semi-detached house. It's discovered that there was a walkway in that shared wall, initially for construction purposes only, which was improperly sealed off and would have been a major fire hazard. Mike also discovers that the insulation in the garage is improperly installed. # What a Mesh - The contractor‚Äôs initial work was up to standard, although using old methods. However, the task of tiling the entire ground floor overwhelmed him, and the standard deteriorated until he quit. Mike is impressed with the tile company (and their delivery vehicle) when they invite him to redo the whole job with products they offer to donate, if he applies them using the correct methods. # Holmes Inspection (Two 1-hour parts) - Homeowners learn the value of doing your homework and verifying the credentials of a home inspector. Having been told that their 1940s-era home was \\"fine\\" in all respects, they move in only to encounter problem after problem. Mike spots nearly all the glaringly obvious issues immediately and brings in his crew to fix what turns into a gigantic electrical/plumbing/HVAC nightmare created by previous attempts at renovation. Among other things, the crew discovers tree roots in the clay basement pipes, a laundry room full of mould, carpenter ants, and an electrical fire that fortunately burned itself out without igniting anything else. One interesting surprise is the discovery of an old and extremely well-constructed well buried in the front yard. =Season Six= Note: The last four episodes of the fifth production season were aired as part of the sixth airing season on HGTV Canada. # Shaky Foundation - In the sixth season debut, Mike and crew arrive at a new home at which the homeowners had discovered that the foundation concrete was woefully weak ‚Äî as little as one-third of the minimum code requirement ‚Äî and which had slipped past the building inspectors, who had only compared the weak foundation wall concrete to that of the foundation floor (without considering that the floor may have also been weak). # Let's Rejoist - In this episode, featuring guest crew member Jordan MacNab, the winner of the first Handyman Superstar Challenge (for which Mike was a judge), Mike comes to the assistance of a homeowner who had discovered a small water stain in their ceiling below an upstairs balcony. After the homeowner hired a roofer to investigate, the roofer discovered that the joists holding the balcony up had completely rotted through, and was forced to abort any roof repair. Finding no other local contractors willing to undertake the challenge of replacing these joists in addition to fixing the original problem, Mike and his crew step up to the plate and make things right. # Completely Incomplete - Mike Holmes arrives to a second-story addition that was claimed by the original contractor to be \\"99% complete\\", and had liened the property when the homeowners refused to pay in full before the project was complete. However, what he discovers is that the \\"99% complete\\" assertion was more like a 99% fabrication. # Stone Walled - Mike Holmes arrives to a home in which the homeowners had removed a retaining wall in their backyard because it needed replacement. Unfortunately, the original contractor had left much of the material ordered unused, and had done a subpar job in building the new wall from cinderblocks meant for the foundation of a house ‚Äî which was completely inappropriate given the size of the wall needed. As the original contractor stopped showing up at the home and became difficult to reach, the concerned homeowners even inquired as to whether the contractor had been injured at another site, and only realized that they had been victimized when a bill for the unused material had shown up at their door. # Gone to Pot - Mike Holmes comes to the aid of a homeowner who had rented out a house to tenants ‚Äî only for the Ontario Provincial Police to inform her that her house had been transformed into a marijuana grow-op. Mike enters the picture after the police had left, and is faced with restoring the damage done to the home largely due to mould but also due to the grower's modifications. The work requires replacing most drywall, most electrical, the kitchen and three bathrooms to turn it back into a comfortable living space again. # Pasadena 911 - In this two-hour special episode, Mike Holmes, after appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, learns of the plight of two homeowners whose \\"dream house\\" renovation had gone horribly wrong (having spent 90% of their money but only having 30% of the work done before the original contractor had apparently abandoned the job) and travels to Pasadena, California to make it right. The renovation effort is spearheaded by Los Angeles-area general contractor James Cowan and foreman Christopher Chico instead of the regular crew (who were in the process of filming the remaining episodes of the season), and only Holmes and senior contractor Damon Bennett (both of whom had to fly regularly between Toronto and Los Angeles) from the regular crew appear in this episode. Even though Mike Holmes and Damon Bennett were the only regular crew members to appear in this episode, one of his subtrades, Craig Low, the painter who has known and worked with Mike for a long time, he happened to be on vacation and came in to help paint the house. He was the only subtrade that Mike knew who appeared in this episode. # Lack of Truss - In this episode, which was also featured on Marketplace six months before it first aired, Mike and his crew visit homeowners who had asked for an additional bedroom, and were convinced by the original contractor that it could be done within the space of their attic. Yet, to do so, the original contractor had removed much of the structural support in the attic, forcing Mike and crew to remove the roof entirely to rebuild the bedroom, raising the height of the house in the process. # Clean Slate - Mike and crew arrive at a century-old house whose bathroom had recently undergone an expensive renovation (complete with slate tiles), but had problems with water seeping through the grout and the fact that the shower did not drain properly. Upon taking the bathroom apart, he discovers the extent of the damage: leaking water had pooled two inches deep under the shower. # Due Date - Mike and crew help out a family whose basement renovation (the first step in a long line of house remodeling jobs) was carefully planned around expecting the birth of a child, but had been delayed by the original contractor for almost a year. With the basement nowhere near completion despite a massive cost overrun and in the middle of a time crunch (due to the baby), the homeowners turn to Mike to help them complete their basement. # Frozen Assets - Mike and crew arrive at a new home development that has been plagued with heating and plumbing issues caused by faulty design, leading to the front porch collapsing. They discover that (design issues aside) while the builders had tried to make the home safe and livable, several glaring mistakes had ultimately caused these problems. # Country Kitchen (a.k.a. Nashville Kitchen) - Mike and crew arrive at a 25-year-old townhouse, where the homeowners had undertaken a kitchen renovation, but ended up with a very small and virtually unusable kitchen. Country singer Charlie Major, a family friend of the homeowners, guest stars. # Third Time Lucky - Mike and crew visit the home of a wheelchair-using woman, who had been living without a bathroom in her apartment for the better part of two years. The homeowner had hired two previous contractors ‚Äî the first was dismissed because of a lack of skill, the second because communications had broken down. The Holmes crew not only try to make her now-gutted bathroom wheelchair-accessible, but also, after seeing the various injuries she had from bumping around on her wheelchair in her apartment, attempted to remodel the rest of her apartment for wheelchair accessibility. =Season Seven= In a change from previous seasons, Mike travels across Canada to help homeowners in other parts of the country, although a number remain within Ontario. Season seven is also notable for the formation of The Holmes Foundation, a charity organization affiliated with the show that promotes awareness of skilled trades (both to homeowners looking to hire them for renovations and to youth as a career choice), and its first project, the episode Lien on Me. Season seven will also have a special \\"behind-the-scenes\\" episode. # Hit the Deck - Mike and crew travel to Saint John, New Brunswick, to help a homeowner whose second-story deck had recently collapsed, injuring the homeowner and several friends. Mike discovers the problem behind the collapse, and builds a replacement for the homeowner. Kevin Howe, the winner of the second Handyman Superstar Challenge, also has a small guest appearance in this episode. # Rocky Reno - The Holmes crew travel to Canmore, Alberta, to fix a front porch and entranceway that was part of an addition. The homeowners became wary of the original contractor after their product started to substantially differ from the plans, and the contractor demanded the completion payment well before the job was complete. # Paradise Island - In Northern Ontario, Mike comes to the aid of a homeowner who had a serious injury in her cottage on an island, prompting the need of a bathroom renovation with shower bars to help her move in and out of her shower. However, the original contractor, though meaning well, had also taken the opportunity to treat the job as if it were a vacation, taking a month to do a four-day job, while leaving serious water issues untouched. Mike comes to the rescue by helping her relocate a hot water heater originally in the exterior of the cottage, while redoing the bathroom and the entrance ramp, as he discovers that the rails are installed on the wrong side (and the more dangerous side remains exposed) - all while noting that, because of their location on an island, any missing supplies will take 30 minutes to recover from their truck at shore, and a trip to the store could take up to three hours. # Lien on Me - In this two-hour special episode, Mike deals with a couple who had a \\"friend\\" do an addition. Although the work was originally estimated to cost just over $200,000, the \\"friend\\" later put a lien on the house for more than $500,000 and took the owners of the house to court. Mike and the crew take the house down brick by brick and stud by stud to save the family from shoddy work done under the previous contract, then design an eco-friendly home and construct it on the site. This episode is notable for employing over 100 companies and 30 months of construction work (demolition having started sometime in Season 5, and construction during Season 6) - to date the most extensive work on the show, in terms of materials, manpower, and time. The Lien on Me episodes are the ones that are shown the least on TV and are very hard to find anywhere. Almost any other Holmes on Homes Episode is aired on a regular basis # Brick-A-Brack - When Mike seemingly comes on the job for exterior work only (later found to have been caused by a humidifier which had been running continuously), they discover that the homeowners' possessions, which were piled from floor to ceiling, are preventing them from doing a full basement inspection. The Holmes crew not only repairs the exterior issue, but also helps the homeowners to sort and throw out their unnecessary possessions. # Re-Inventing - The Holmes Crew inspects a house that has had intermittent heating issues in the six years since it was built, yet had gone unaddressed by the builder or Ontario's New Home Warranty Program (due to a series of bureaucratic issues and \\"band-aid\\" remedies). The problem was discovered to have been caused in part by alterations to the design of the house having been done without necessary matching alterations to the HVAC system, thus forcing Holmes and his crew to completely replace the HVAC, hot water, and electrical systems. # Behind the Scenes - In this special episode, the Holmes crew (both construction and production) reveal the behind the scenes work during the filming from the seventh season, including the process from viewer submission to filming, how three or four episodes are produced at the same time, and the logistical issues with having a camera crew and a construction crew trying to work over each other. The episode includes behind- the-scenes footage from Additional Grief, Country Kitchen, Paradise Island, Lien on Me, and an upcoming episode titled Blind Faith, as well as a Maxwell House commercial and Mike's interview on 20/20. It also explores the origins of the series and how the Holmes Foundation was founded, as well as providing some insight into the Holmes family (all three of Mike's children work on the show in some capacity). # Blind Faith - After winning a $15,000 bathroom renovation from a church auction, the homeowners discover that the contractor behind the renovation prize had spent another $15,000 with only a rough-in to show for the $30,000 worth of work. The Holmes Crew arrives to fix the bathroom. # Kitchen Knockout - George Chuvalo, former heavyweight boxer, finds himself the victim of a disreputable contractor. When the situation was brought to Mike Holmes' attention, he felt honored to help out his boyhood hero. # Pane in the Glass - The homeowners call in the Holmes Crew to fix a bay window. The original contractor's work, involving replacing a regular window with a bay window without supporting structure, were captured on tape by a neighbor's home security system cameras. # Gut Ache - The Holmes Crew arrive to help a homeowner with a kitchen renovation ‚Äî the previous renovators had specialized in finishing work (such as cabinets), but had not addressed any of the underlying problems at all. # A Different Slant - The Holmes Crew address a couple who every year has snow accumulating in their attic ‚Äî so much that they are forced to shovel it all into plastic bags. # Rock Bottom - The Holmes Crew address a custom-built home, whose brand-new components are beginning to show signs of deterioration. Footage from this episode was also featured on CBC Marketplace in 2009, where two other homes built by the same builder were investigated. # Capital Offense (a.k.a. Bath Reno Gone Wrong) - The Holmes Crew travel to Ottawa, Ontario to help two of the show's biggest fans, who, despite having heeded Mike's advice and researched meticulously, nevertheless find that their bathroom renovation has gone awry. =Best of Holmes on Homes= Best of Holmes on Homes is a 2012 remix TV series featuring clips from Holmes on Homes, brought together on a common theme, to illustrate home problems.

Distributed by McFarlane Toys in July 2001, the series included six monsters designed by horror author Clive Barker. Background The toy line was officially announced at the International Toy Fair in New York in February 2001. Barker said the following about creating his first toy line: Each of the figures included a chapter of the 32-page novelette, written by Barker. Tortured Souls 2 Due to the success of the idea, a second series titled Tortured Souls 2: The Fallen was released the following year. The appearance of the new figures was more visceral than the first toy line, with less reliance on the bondage-like clothing styles of the first series and more reliance on surgical alteration and mutilation or, as Clive Barker described it, \\"the use of flesh as canvas.\\" Additionally, characters of Tortured Souls 2: The Fallen neither appeared in the original novella nor came with any additional story writing. Characters =Tortured Souls= *Agonistes - A demon created by God on the seventh day of creation after Adam and Eve. Agonistes is an artist who uses flesh as his canvas to transform Supplicants into monstrous beings. He frequently occupies \\"burning places\\" such as deserts or desolate cities where citizens may pray to him. From what little was revealed of Agonistes' background, he once performed his artistry on Judas Iscariot after his betrayal of Christ. However, the tortured man begged and cried so that Agonistes hung him from a tree. This was the only time the demon showed mercy to a Supplicant. *Lucidique - The daughter of a Primordium Senator who had openly criticized the city's degenerate ruling class and was promptly assassinated by Zarles Kreiger. After luring Kreiger to the desert to be converted by Agonistes, Lucidique was kidnapped and murdered by mob boss Duraf Cascarellian. Resurrected and transformed by Agonistes, Lucidique killed Cascarellian and his sons and soon became lover to the Scythe-Meister. Sometime later, she and Kreiger were confronted by Talisac's Venal Anatomica. The creature brutally killed Kreiger but Lucidique managed to blind him. *Mongroid - * The Scythe-Meister - An assassin working under Don Cascarellian with an affinity for scythes, Zarles Kreiger grew up the son of a prostitute on the streets of Primordium. He was ordered to kill a troublesome Senator and was caught in the act by the man's daughter, Lucidique, who led him to Agonistes. Remade as the Scythe-Meister, Zarles slaughtered Primordium's emperor, Perfetto XI, and later became lovers with a similarly-transformed Lucidique. Zarles would ultimately meet his violent fate at the hands of Venal Anatomica while defending Lucidique from the creature's rampage. *Talisac - * Venal Anatomica - A Frankenstein-esque creature assembled and given life by Doctor Talisac on commission from Primordium's three Generals - Montefalco, Urbano and Bogoto - in hopes of creating a super soldier to defeat the Scythe- Meister following the latter's assassination of Emperor Perfetto XI. =Tortured Souls 2= * Szaltax - A six-limbed creature featuring grasping mechanical prosthetics. * Zain - He is strapped onto a pole and features several mechanical appendages. * Suffering Bob - A mutation involving the combination of several humans into one grotesque creature. * Feverish - A grotesquely large creature on a slab giving birth to worms. * Moribundi - He is in the unfortunate position of being sacrificed at the altar of science and technology. * Camille Noire - A winged angelic creature whose cranium had a run-in with a circular saw. Tortured Souls: The Legend of Primordium  Tortured Souls: The Legend of Primordium is a single volume of the six separate pieces of the Tortured Souls novellas originally available with the toys. It was published by Subterranean Press in February 2015.http://clivebarker.info/bookswip.html#6destinies Tortured Souls: Animae Damnatae Tortured Souls: Animae Damnatae is a planned film adaption of Clive Barker‚Äôs original line of Tortured Souls toys. =Background= The film project was officially announced in December 2003, with Barker signing a deal to direct the picture for Universal Studios. The film has been discussed since the release of the first toy series, but as of 2009 there is very little confirmed although Barker still lists it as a project in pre-production. News of the plotline is that it revolves around the city of Primordium, a corrupt monarch-governed city. You follow the 6 characters of Agonistes, a transformer of flesh, an ancient entity that was possibly created by God; The Scythe- Meister, an assassin that was transformed by Agonistes, built to bring the corrupt empire to its knees; Lucidique, the daughter of a Senator killed by the Scythe-Meister, who brings her to Agonistes for transformation, and who falls strangely in love with him; Dr. Talisac, a twisted doctor, addicted to many of his own medications, who creates a womb in himself for his creation to grow, and attaches himself to a machine; Venal Anatomica, a hulking assassin created by Dr. Talisac, he feels no fear or loyalty to his creator, only to the General that commands him; The Mongroid, the creature that grew in Talisac‚Äôs womb, more bestial than human, he possesses a well-formed head, and a gaping maw coming from his stomach. The proposed tagline for the film is Six Destinies ‚Äì One Legacy.

During the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (AD 306‚Äì337), Christianity began to transition to the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. Historians remain uncertain about Constantine's reasons for favoring Christianity, and theologians and historians have often argued about which form of early Christianity he subscribed to. There is no consensus among scholars as to whether he adopted his mother Helena's Christianity in his youth, or, as claimed by Eusebius of Caesarea, encouraged her to convert to the faith he had adopted himself. Constantine ruled the Roman Empire as sole emperor for much of his reign. Some scholars allege that his main objective was to gain unanimous approval and submission to his authority from all classes, and therefore chose Christianity to conduct his political propaganda, believing that it was the most appropriate religion that could fit with the Imperial cult (see also Sol Invictus). Regardless, under the Constantinian dynasty Christianity expanded throughout the Empire, launching the era of State church of the Roman Empire.Wendy Doniger (ed.), \\"Constantine I\\", in Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2006), p. 262. Whether Constantine sincerely converted to Christianity or remained loyal to Paganism is a matter of debate among historians (see also Constantine's religious policy).Noel Lenski (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine (Cambridge University Press, 2006), \\"Introduction\\". . His formal conversion in 312 is almost universally acknowledged among historians, despite that he was baptized only on his deathbed by the Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia in 337;Hans A. Pohlsander, The Emperor Constantine (Routledge, NY 2004), pp. 82‚Äì84. ; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine), p. 82. the real reasons behind it remain unknown and are debated also. According to Hans Pohlsander, Professor Emeritus of History at the University at Albany, SUNY, Constantine's conversion was just another instrument of realpolitik in his hands meant to serve his political interest in keeping the Empire united under his control: Constantine's decision to cease the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire was a turning point for early Christianity, sometimes referred to as the Triumph of the Church, the Peace of the Church or the Constantinian shift. In 313, Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan decriminalizing Christian worship. The emperor became a great patron of the Church and set a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor within the Church and raised the notions of orthodoxy, Christendom, ecumenical councils, and the state church of the Roman Empire declared by edict in 380. He is revered as a saint and isapostolos in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church, and various Eastern Catholic Churches for his example as a \\"Christian monarch‚Äù. Before Constantine The first recorded official persecution of Christians on behalf of the Roman Empire was in AD 64, when, as reported by the Roman historian Tacitus, Emperor Nero attempted to blame Christians for the Great Fire of Rome. According to Church tradition, it was during the reign of Nero that Peter and Paul were martyred in Rome. However, modern historians debate whether the Roman government distinguished between Christians and Jews prior to Nerva's modification of the Fiscus Judaicus in 96, from which point practising Jews paid the tax and Christians did not.Wylen, Stephen M., The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction, Paulist Press (1995), , Pp 190-192.; Dunn, James D. G., Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing (1999), , Pp 33-34.; Boatwright, Mary Taliaferro & Gargola, Daniel J & Talbert, Richard John Alexander, The Romans: From Village to Empire, Oxford University Press (2004), , p. 426. Christians suffered from sporadic and localized persecutions over a period of two and a half centuries. Their refusal to participate in the Imperial cult was considered an act of treason and was thus punishable by execution. The most widespread official persecution was carried out by Diocletian. During the Great Persecution (303‚Äì311), the emperor ordered Christian buildings and the homes of Christians torn down and their sacred books collected and burned. Christians were arrested, tortured, mutilated, burned, starved, and condemned to gladiatorial contests to amuse spectators.Bomgardner, D. L. The Story of the Roman Amphitheatre. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 142. The Great Persecution officially ended in April 311, when Galerius, senior emperor of the Tetrarchy, issued an edict of toleration, which granted Christians the right to practice their religion, though it did not restore any property to them.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum (\\"On the Deaths of the Persecutors\\") ch. 35‚Äì34. Constantine, Caesar in the Western empire, and Licinius, Caesar in the East, also were signatories to the edict of toleration.Galerius, \\"Edict of Toleration\\", in Documents of the Christian Church, trans. and ed. Henry Bettenson (London: Oxford University Press, 1963), 21. It has been speculated that Galerius' reversal of his long-standing policy of Christian persecution has been attributable to one or both of these co-Caesars.H. A. Drake, Constantine and the Bishops: The Politics of Intolerance (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000), 149. Conversion It is possible (but not certain) that Constantine's mother, Helena, exposed him to Christianity; in any case he only declared himself a Christian after issuing the Edict of Milan. Peter Brown, The Rise of Christendom 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 61. Writing to Christians, Constantine made clear that he believed that he owed his successes to the protection of the High God alone.Peter Brown, The Rise of Christendom 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 60. = Vision of Apollo = Jugate gold multiple issued by Constantine at Ticinum in 313, showing the emperor and the god Sol, with Sol also depicted in his quadriga on Constantine's shield. Follis issued by Constantine at Lugdunum c.30910, with Sol holding a globe and wearing a radiate crown. Constantine is described as In 310 a panegyric, preserved in the Panegyrici Latini collection and delivered at Trier for the joint occasion of the city's birthday and Constantine's quinquennalia, recounted a vision apparently seen by the emperor while journeying between Marseille and Trier. The panegyricist recounts that the god Apollo appeared to Constantine in company with Victoria and together presented him with three wreaths representing thirty years of power. This vision was perhaps in a dream experienced by the emperor while practising incubation at the shrine of Apollo Grannus in Grand, Vosges. Eusebius was aware of this vision, or reports of it, and refers in his own Panegyric of Constantine of 336 to \\"tricennial crowns\\"Eusebius, In Praise of Constantine, 6.1 bestowed by the hand of God in Christianity on Constantine, \\"augmenting the sway of his kingdom by long years\\".Eusebius, In Praise of Constantine, 10.7 = Battle of Milvian Bridge = Eusebius of Caesarea and other Christian sources record that Constantine experienced a dramatic series of events sometime between his father Constantius I's death in 306 and the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312. The battle secured Constantine's claim to the title of augustus in the West, which he had assumed unilaterally when his father died. According to the Life of Constantine, written after Constantine himself had died by Eusebius, who admitted he heard the story long after it had happened from the emperor himself, and who is not specific about when or where it occurred, Constantine saw a vision of a \\"a cross-shaped trophy formed from light\\" above the sun at midday.Rubens (1622). Constantine's army sees a chi-rho in the daytime sky. The Greek words \\"'\\" (in this sign, conquer) are often rendered in a Latin version, \\"in hoc signo vinces\\" (in this sign, you will conquer).R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55. According to Eusebius, Constantine also had a dream that same night. In the dream, Eusebius himself, writing his Church History shortly after 313, makes no mention of this story in that work, and does not recount it until composing his posthumous biography of Constantine decades afterwards. Lactantius, writing 313‚Äì15 and around twenty years before Eusebius's Life, also does not mention a vision in the sky. Instead, Lactantius mentions only that Constantine's dream took place on the eve of the climactic battle on the Pons Milvius across the Tiber, with the crucial detail that the \\"sign\\" was marked on the Constantinian soldiers' shields. According to Lactantius: Constantine's dream in a 9th century Byzantine manuscript Medallion issued by Constantine at Ticinum in 315, with chi-rho on the emperor's crest and Romulus and Remus and the Lupa on his shield.Late Roman sarcophagus with a combined cross and wreathed chi-rho. Follis issued by Constantine at Constantinople in 337, with a chi-rho on a labarum. It is unclear from these sources what Constantine saw and what was marked on his army's shields. Eusebius's description of the daytime vision suggests a cross-shaped (either Œ§ or ‚Ä†) symbol, whereas Lactantius's description suggests a staurogram (‚≥®), although the crux ansata (‚ò•) or the Egyptian hieroglyph ankh (ìãπ) have been proposed as interpretations as well. All of these symbols were used by Christians in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Eusebius concurs with Lactantius that a new device was added to Constantine's soldiers' shields, but does not connect this with the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, saying only that the \\"sign of the saving trophy\\" was marked, but not specifying when.Eusebius, Vita Constantini, 4.21 Sometime after 317, Eusebius himself was permitted by Constantine, probably either in 325 or in 335, to see a standard that was made according to the emperor's dreamt instructions during the civil war. He described it as: This later description of Eusebius's, written after 324, suggests a more elaborate symbol than does Lactantius's earlier text, involving the Greek letters rho (Œ°) and chi (Œß) ligatured as the chi rho (‚òß), a monogram of , referring to Jesus. Possibly Eusebius's description refers to a chi-rho inside the loop of an ankh. Following the battle and the defeat and death of Maxentius, the now undisputed emperor in the west performed an adventus, a ceremonial entrance to the city. Arriving inside Rome's walls he ignored the altars to the gods prepared on the Capitoline and did not carry out the customary sacrifices to celebrate a general's victorious entry into Rome, instead heading directly to the imperial palace. This is probably because the traditional Roman triumph, concluding with the sacrifice to Jupiter Optimus Maximus at his temple on the Capitoline, was traditionally celebrated after victory over Rome's enemies, rather than after the conquest of the city by a claimant in a civil war. The Arch of Constantine, for which numerous reliefs from earlier monuments depicting prior emperors sacrificing to various gods were re-carved with the face of Constantine, does not have an image of Constantine sacrificing to Jupiter, although he is shown sacrificing to Apollo and to Hercules. =Edict of Milan= In 313 Constantine and Licinius announced \\"that it was proper that the Christians and all others should have liberty to follow that mode of religion which to each of them appeared best,\\"Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum (\\"On the Deaths of the Persecutors\\") ch. 48. thereby granting tolerance to all religions, including Christianity. The Edict of Milan went a step further than the earlier Edict of Serdica by Galerius in 311, returning confiscated Church property. This edict made the empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship; it neither made the traditional religions illegal nor made Christianity the state religion, as occurred later with the Edict of Thessalonica of 380. The Edict of Milan did, however, raise the stock of Christianity within the empire and it reaffirmed the importance of religious worship to the welfare of the state.Constantine and Licinius, \\"The 'Edict of Milan'\\", in Documents of the Christian Church, trans. and ed. Henry Bettenson (London: Oxford University Press, 1963), 22. Most influential people in the empire, especially high military officials, had not been converted to Christianity and still participated in the traditional religions of Rome; Constantine's rule exhibited at least a willingness to appease these factions. The Roman coins minted up to eight years after the battle still bore the images of Roman gods. The monuments he first commissioned, such as the Arch of Constantine, contained no reference to Christianity.J.R. Curran, Pagan City and Christian Capital. Rome in the Fourth Century (Oxford, 2000) pp. 70‚Äì90. Patronage of the Church Hagia Eirene was the first church commissioned by Constantine in Constantinople and burned down in the Nika riots. The present structure is 6th century. The accession of Constantine was a turning point for early Christianity. After his victory, Constantine took over the role of patron of the Christian faith. He supported the Church financially, had a number of basilicas built, granted privileges (e.g., exemption from certain taxes) to clergy, promoted Christians to high-ranking offices, returned property confiscated during the Great Persecution of Diocletian,R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55-56 and endowed the church with land and other wealth.MacMullan 1984:49. Between 324 and 330, Constantine built a new city, New Rome, at Byzantium on the Bosporos, which would be named Constantinople for him. Unlike \\"old\\" Rome, the city began to employ overtly Christian architecture, contained churches within the city walls, and had no pre-existing temples from other religions.R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 56 In doing this, however, Constantine required those who had not converted to Christianity to pay for the new city.MacMullan 1984:49. Christian chroniclers tell that it appeared necessary to Constantine \\"to teach his subjects to give up their rites ... and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,\\"quoted after MacMullan 1984:49. This led to the closure of temples because of a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure;MacMullan 1984:50. Constantine did not need to use force to implement this.MacMullan 1984:49. It was the chronicler Theophanes who added centuries later that temples \\"were annihilated\\", but this was considered \\"not true\\" by contemporary historians.MacMullan 1984: 141, Note 35 to Chapter V; Theophanes, Chron. a. 322 (PG 108.117) =Public office= Constantine respected cultivated persons, and his court was composed of older, respected, and honored men. Men from leading Roman families who declined to convert to Christianity were denied positions of power yet still received appointments; even up to the end of his life, two-thirds of his top government were non- Christian. =Legal reforms= Constantine's laws enforced and reflected his Christian attitudes. Crucifixion was abolished for reasons of Christian piety but was replaced with hanging, to demonstrate the preservation of Roman supremacy. On March 7, 321, Sunday, which was not sacred to Christians but to the Roman Sun God Sol Invictus, was declared an official day of rest. On that day markets were banned and public offices were closed,Corpus Juris Civilis 3.12.2 https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022718/http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/justinianc.html accessed 20 April 2016 except for the purpose of freeing slaves.Carson, Don A.

There were, however, no restrictions on performing farming work, which was the work of the great majority of the population, on Sundays.MacMullen 1969; New Catholic Encyclopedia, 1908; Theodosian Code.

Only three or four churches are known certainly to have existed in Constantine's reign, but others appear to have been planned or established, for which the scriptures were commissioned. The volumes were likely gospel books containing the Canonical gospels of the Four Evangelists rather than complete Bibles with the entire Biblical canon, which were very rare in antiquity. Athanasius (Apol. Const. 4) recorded around 340 Alexandrian scribes preparing Bibles for Constans. Little else is known. It has been speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus are examples of these Bibles. Together with the Peshitta and Codex Alexandrinus, these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.The Canon Debate, McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, pages 414-415, for the entire paragraph According to Socrates Scholasticus, Constantine commissioned the construction of the first Church of Hagia Irene in Constantinople, on the site now occupied by the Justinianic church of the same name. It commemorated the peace won by Constantine and Crispus's victory over Licinius and Licinius II at the Battle of Chrysopolis in 324; its name, the Church of the Holy Peace () recalled the Altar of Peace () built by the first deified Roman emperor in Rome, Augustus. Two other large churches were dedicated to Saint Mocius and to Saint Acacius; both worthies had supposedly been martyred in Byzantium during the Diocletianic Persecution. The Church of St Mocius was supposed to have included parts of a former temple of Zeus or Hercules, though it is unlikely that such a temple existed on the site, which was without the walls of the Constantinian city as well as of erstwhile Severan Byzantium. According to Eusebius, Christian liturgies were also performed in Constantine's Mausoleum, the site of which became the Church of the Holy Apostles; although Eusebius does not mention any Byzantine church by name, he reports that Christian sites were numerous inside the city and around it. Later tradition ascribed to Constantine the foundations in Constantinople of the Church of Saint Menas, the Church of Saint Agathonicus, the Church of Saint Michael at nearby Anaplous, and the Church of Hagios Dynamis ().  Christian emperorship  = Enforcement of doctrine = The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define orthodoxy and maintain orthodoxy.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476‚Äì752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14‚Äì15. The Church generally regarded the definition of doctrine as the responsibility of the bishops; the emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476‚Äì752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 15. The emperor ensured that God was properly worshiped in his empire; what proper worship (orthodoxy) and doctrines and dogma consisted of was for the Church to determine.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476‚Äì752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 16. Constantine had become a worshiper of the Christian God, but he found that there were many opinions on that worship and indeed on who and what that God was. In 316, Constantine was asked to adjudicate in a North African dispute of the Donatist sect (who began by refusing obedience to any bishops who had yielded in any way to persecution, later regarding all bishops but their own sect as utterly contaminated). More significantly, in 325 he summoned the First Council of Nicaea, effectively the first Ecumenical Council (unless the Council of Jerusalem is so classified).Pre-Ecumenical councils include the Council of Rome (155), Second Council of Rome 193, Council of Ephesus (193), Council of Carthage (251), Council of Iconium 258, Council of Antioch (264), Council of Elvira 306, Council of Carthage (311), Council of Ancyra 314, Council of Arles (314) and the Council of Neo-Caesarea 315. The Council of Nicaea is the first major attempt by Christians to define orthodoxy for the whole Church. Until Nicaea, all previous Church Councils had been local or regional synods affecting only portions of the Church. Nicaea dealt primarily with the Arian controversy. Constantine himself was torn between the Arian and Trinitarian camps. After the Nicene council, and against its conclusions, he eventually recalled Arius from exile and banished Athanasius of Alexandria to Trier. Just before his death in May 337, Constantine was baptised into Christianity. Up until this time he had been a catechumen for most of his adult life. He believed that if he waited to get baptized on his death bed he was in less danger of polluting his soul with sin and not getting to heaven. He was baptized by his distant relative Arian Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia. During Eusebius of Nicomedia's time in the Imperial court, the Eastern court and the major positions in the Eastern Church were held by Arians or Arian sympathizers.Drake, \\"Constantine and the Bishops\\", pp.395. With the exception of a short period of eclipse, Eusebius enjoyed the complete confidence both of Constantine and Constantius II and was the tutor of Emperor Julian the Apostate. After Constantine's death, his son and successor Constantius II was an Arian, as was Emperor Valens. Raphael's The Baptism of Constantine. =Suppression of other religions= Constantine's position on the religions traditionally practiced in Rome evolved during his reign. In fact, his coinage and other official motifs, until 325, had affiliated him with the pagan cult of Sol Invictus. At first, Constantine encouraged the construction of new templesGerberding, R. and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 28. and tolerated traditional sacrifices; by the end of his reign, he had begun to order the pillaging and tearing down of Roman temples.R. MacMullen, \\"Christianizing The Roman Empire A.D.100-400, Yale University Press, 1984, \\"A History of the Church\\", Philip Hughes, Sheed & Ward, rev ed 1949, vol I chapter 6.Eusebius Pamphilius and Schaff, Philip (Editor) and McGiffert, Rev.

Constantine is said to have written to Shapur II in 324 and urged him to protect Christians under his rule.Eusebius, vita Constantini IV, 8-13 With the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, Christians in Persia would be regarded as allies of Persia's ancient enemy. According to an anonymous Christian account, Shapur II wrote to his generals: Constantinian shift Constantinian shift is a term used by some theologians and historians of antiquity to describe the political and theological aspects and outcomes of the 4th-century process of Constantine's integration of the Imperial government with the Church that began with the First Council of Nicaea. The term was popularized by the Mennonite theologian John H. Yoder.e.g. in The claim that there ever was Constantinian shift has been disputed; Peter Leithart argues that there was a \\"brief, ambiguous 'Constantinian moment' in the fourth century,\\" but that there was \\"no permanent, epochal 'Constantinian shift'.\\"Peter Leithart, Defending Constantine: The Twilight of an Empire and the Dawn of Christendom, p 287.

Muntz metal is a form of alpha-beta brass with about 60% copper, 40% zinc and a trace of iron. It is named after George Fredrick Muntz, a metal-roller of Birmingham, England, who commercialised the alloy following his patent of 1832.Muntz's US Patent, issued on October 22, 1832, was among the thousands destroyed in the December 15, 1836 Patent Office fire but was reported in Volume 12 (New Series) of the Journal of the Franklin Institute at p. 195 (1833) http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uva.x002092353?urlappend=%3Bseq=203 Known both as Muntz Metal and Yellow Metal, the alloy must be worked hot and is used today for corrosion resistant machine parts. Alpha-beta (also called duplex) metals contain both the Œ± and Œ≤ phases. The Œ± phase refers to a crystal structure that is face-centered cubic, while the Œ≤ phase is body-centered cubic. Its original application was as a replacement for copper sheathing on the bottom of boats, as it maintained the anti-fouling abilities of the pure copper at around two thirds of the price. It became the material of choice for this application and Muntz made his fortune. It was found that copper would gradually leach from the alloy in sea water, poisoning any organism that attempted to attach itself to a hull sheathed in the metal. Thus, it was also used to sheathe the piles of piers in tropical seas, as a protection against teredo shipworms, and in locomotive tubes. After successful experimentation with the sheathing Muntz also took out a patent for bolts of the same composition. These too proved a success as they not only were cheaper but also very strong and lasted longer. A notable use of Muntz Metal was in the hull of the Cutty Sark. Company history Muntz's new metal contained more copper, less zinc, and a bit of iron not present in a similar 56:44 alloy patented by William Collins in 1800. Production began on Water Street, Birmingham, but moved to Swansea in 1837. In 1842 he bought the French Walls Works in Smethwick, formerly the site of James Watt Jr.'s ironworks. The site soon proved inadequate, and in 1850 a further were bought, on the other side of the Birmingham, Wolverhampton & Stour Valley Railway. Eventually as the business outgrew Muntz‚Äôs own rolling mill in Birmingham, he joined in partnership with Pascoe Grenfell and sons who produced it at their Swansea mill as ‚ÄòMuntz‚Äôs Patent Metal Company‚Äô. They and other partners then fixed the prices of the alloy at ¬£18 per ton lower than the market price for the equivalent copper product, serving to establish Muntz Metal as the sheathing of choice where transport costs still kept it as an efficient competitor. As an example of their success in entering the market, 50 ships were metalled with Muntz Metal in 1837, over 100 in 1838, doubling in 1840 and doubling again by 1844. With Muntz successfully supervising the manufacturing operations, by 1840 Muntz‚Äôs Patent Metal Company employed 30 men to smelt and roll the alloy and were producing 2,000 tons yearly. Three years later the Company had over 200 men producing 3-4000 tons yearly at ¬£8 per ton profit. By then the Grenfells had left the partnership, for the agreement with Pascoe Grenfell & Sons had been terminated with some acrimony in 1842. When Muntz‚Äôs patent expired in 1846, they and others began making fastenings and sheathing to the Muntz patent at will. Muntz died in 1857, to be succeeded by his eldest son, also called George Fredrick, who sold it in 1864 to a joint stock company, Muntz's Metal Co. Ltd. In 1921 the company was bought by Elliott's Metal Company, which became part of ICI's Imperial Metals division (now IMI plc) in 1928.

It takes its name from James Connolly, a socialist republican, born in Edinburgh, Scotland and executed by the British Army for his part in the 1916 Easter Rising. History The Connolly Association (CA) was founded at a meeting in Doughty Street, Central London in 1938. Many of those attending the meeting had either been members of the London branch of the Republican Congress or the League against Imperialism. Some had been active in the Irish Self-Determination League of the 1920s. Originally called the Connolly Club, its aims were: to work for the complete freedom of the Irish people; provide a social and cultural centre for those promoting the teachings of James Connolly; arrange public meetings, discussions and lectures explaining Connolly's ideas; and to show solidarity with oppressed nations and peoples throughout the world. The CA's paper Irish Freedom, was first published in January 1939, being renamed the Irish Democrat in 1945. The first major campaign undertaken by the Connolly Club was in the Frank Ryan Release Campaign, in support of the Republican Congress leader and International Brigade commander. The campaign, involving extensive lobbying of British and Irish politicians, trade unions and the Labour Party, exemplified the methods to be used by the organisation throughout the years. The establishment of branches soon followed, initially in Liverpool, Birmingham and London, and then in Manchester, Glasgow, Coatbridge, Portsmouth, Northampton, Oxford and Cambridge. =The war years and after= The period of the second world war saw the CA campaigning to preserve Irish neutrality and in defence of Irish workers in Britain. The 1945 general election gave the organisation hope that the new Labour government would carry out its long held policy of Irish self-determination. However, by 1949 the Attlee government had passed the Ireland Act, which preserved the unionist position in Northern Ireland. During this period the CA puts its main efforts into welfare work among the Irish in Britain, coming under fierce attack from, among others, the Catholic Church, which accused the organisation of being a ‚Äòcommunist front‚Äô. Although the CA had communists in its ranks, its membership also included many Labour Party members and those with no party affiliation. The CA had always maintained a non-party political stance whilst recognising that the best hope for Irish self-determination lay with the election of a Labour government at Westminster. Responding to the passing of the Ireland Act of 1949, the CA held protest meetings and produced a pamphlet, How to End Partition, setting out the CA's policy of working in the trade union movement to win support for justice in Ireland. In the 1950s the CA's work, particularly in relation to sales of the Irish Democrat, increased dramatically. There were meetings in Hyde Park every Sunday afternoon. A full- time worker was appointed and the paper was given a more professional look. The 1950s was also the height of the anti-colonial struggle across the world. This was reflected in the columns of the Irish Democrat. The CA's stepped up its trade union. Numerous pamphlets were published aimed specifically at trade union members and a conference organised. Irishmen make good Trade Unionists was part of the CA's attempts to persuade the trade union movement to tackle issues of concern to the Irish community. New impetus was gained in 1955 as the Association adopted a new constitution and added to its title, becoming the Connolly Association and the Irish Self-Determination League. On the issue of partition, the Association stressed that Northern Ireland was being systematically eroded, politically, culturally and economically as a result of Britain's continued claim of sovereignty. and it called upon the labour movement to take up an anti-partition policy. =Civil rights and the EEC - the 1960s= Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the CA through the pages on the Irish Democrat, influenced those trade unionists in Belfast who first proposed the idea of establishing a civil rights movement to expose unionism in Northern Ireland. The Association continued to organise meetings throughout Britain and a number of new branches were established. In the 1960s the Irish Democrat set out a ‚Äòthree-pronged attack‚Äô for ending partition without violence: the building of a movement for basic civil liberties and democracy in Northern Ireland with the aim of winning over a section of the unionist population; to calls for an end to partition; unity of national opinion in the Republic of Ireland to put pressure on the Dublin government to promote reunification and a campaign in Britain to make Ireland the cause of the labour movement. In 1961, the Irish Democrat was the first paper in Britain to warn of the dangers in Britain's entry in to the Common Market. The CA then, as now, adopting a policy of resisting attempts to subvert national democracy by an unelected European superstate. By 1968 the civil rights campaign was at the height of its activities with demands for a bill of rights increasing in Britain also. The regime at Stormont was unwilling to meet the democratic demands of the movement and in September 1968 the Irish Democrat warned, ‚Äúunless something is done soon to end the injustices which exist in British- occupied Ireland there is going to be an explosion there‚Äù. The Irish Democrat recorded numerous meetings, pickets, petitions and resolutions being put to various organisation as the crisis unfolded. =1970s: the violence erupts= The CA put forward the argument that only the British government could affect a change in the deteriorating circumstances and the campaign for a bill of rights became the main focus of Association's work. The work intensified following Operation Banner, the introduction of British troops onto the streets. The entry of Britain into the EEC was an important political development. The CA's 1971 annual conference in Manchester urged opposition to the EEC on the grounds that its object was the creation of a vast multinational imperialism which would destroy the internal democracy of the nations by handing over the most important decision making to an unelected bureaucracy, leading to the buildup of another world power block. Indignation at the events of Bloody Sunday in January 1972 led to another upsurge in activities. Within hours of the events of that day, the CA brought out a special bulletin on the incident and distributed it widely. At CA meetings throughout Britain members called for the resignation of Reginald Maudling, the Home Secretary, and for a full and independent inquiry. The CA was also concerned about growing demands for the abolition of Stormont and found itself somewhat isolated in warning of the dangers of ending Stormont and giving all powers to London. The Association saw that as yet another example of imperial control taking away even a small amount of local decision making. The unfolding political drama from 1968 to 1972 brought many new members into the Association, a large number second-generation Irish. The CA moved to new premises during this period and established an Irish bookshop, which was to be the only specialist Irish bookshop in Britain until the 1980s. Welcoming the IRA truce in 1972, the CA called for talks' renewal when those between the Provisionals and the British government broke down. Following the imposition of direct rule in 1972, the CA looked to a bill of rights to be included in any new devolutionary arrangements. The CA argued for the opening of a constitutional road to a united Ireland but took a longer-term view in the interests of seeking the support of some unionists. It also set out the need for the British government to declare its intention to withdraw. Operation Demetrius, the imposition of internment, led the CA to call for a committee to co-ordinate opposition to it, the Emergency Provisions Act (EPA) and the actions by the British military forces. The Ulster Workers' Council strike in 1974 led to the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement. The CA condemned it as \\"a challenge to democracy and socialism by some of the most reactionary forces in these islands\\", published the pamphlet Fourteen Days of Fascist Terror and organised a speaking tour of Belfast trade unionists. Following an upsurge of bombings in England in the mid-1970s, the Irish threw were subjected to the draconian powers of the Prevention of Terrorism Acts (PTA). Sales of the Irish Democrat declined as outlets for sales were closed. The CA criticised the bombing campaign as counterproductive but called for the Irish community to oppose reactionary measures used against it and questioned the validity of the convictions of the Birmingham Six. In the absence of moves toward devolution for Northern Ireland, the 1976 CA annual conference decided that the main political task was the need to win Labour's support for an anti-partitionist policy. However, by the late 1970s the CA had become increasingly concerned by the British government's failure to deal with the Irish Question. Irish neutrality was also under threat because of NATO and increasing European integration, and the CA took up the issue as a means of interesting the growing peace movement in the Irish question. =The Thatcher decade: 1980s= Following the defeat of the Labour government in 1979, the Labour Party reassessed its Irish policy, which for a decade had reflected the views of Britain's military and civil service establishment. The CA lobbied hard for Labour to adopt a policy of reunification. In 1981 Labour adopted a policy of Irish unity. That was also the year of the hunger strikes, the CA organised lobbies of parliament and wrote to MPs. In 1984, the CA conference ‚ÄòThe Irish Question and World Peace‚Äô highlighting Ireland as an issue for the British peace movement. Through the pages of the Irish Democrat, the CA highlighted issues such as strip searching, nuclear pollution in the Irish Sea, the problem of anti-Irish racism and the strategic position of Northern Ireland in Britain's Cold War games. The 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement was a move by the two government to break the political deadlock while isolating republicans and nationalists. The Irish Democrat described the agreement was \\"the most squalid and contemptible piece of hypocrisy since Lloyd George swindled Michael Collins\\". In 1989, the CA published a pamphlet How to Go and an important contribution of ‚ÄòTime To Go‚Äô initiative, which had succeeded in gaining considerable broad support. In the same year, a briefing paper on the PTA was published and the CA organised a conference, ‚ÄòScenarios for Peace‚Äô . =The road to peace: 1990s= The early part of the 1990s witnessed a period of campaigning by the Association. In 1990 the Association published a briefing paper, Revisionism in Irish Historical Writings, and a pamphlet, Justice Denied, on miscarriages of justice. The CA also organised a conference on Irish unity sponsored by NALGO and RMT, the first time national unions had sponsored a conference on Ireland. Collaboration with the Action Group for Irish Youth and the Construction Safety Campaign resulted in a major photographic exhibition focusing on workers in the building industry. This was followed in 1991 by a pamphlet, Slaughter on Britain's Building Sites published by the Association. Guests at that year's Mountjoy Martyr's Commemoration event organised by the CA included Billy Power and Hugh Callaghan of the Birmingham Six Also in 1991 the CA initiated the Trade Union network on Ireland, which brought together many trade unionists from throughout Britain to look at ways of building support for Irish unity within the trade union movement. Like many left-leaning organisations, the years of the mid-1990s proved to be difficult times. During these years the Association lost its main bookshop, due to a decision by Camden council to sell the premises. although a scaled-down version was to emerge in what had been the CA's offices on Gray's Inn Road. The Association was also unable to continue employing an organiser. Buoyed by the Irish Peace Initiative launched by Sinn F√©in‚Äôs Gerry Adams and the SDLP leader John Hume the Association resumed its publications programme, commencing with Orangeism: Myth or Reality in 1997 and The Road to National Democracy: the Story of the Irish Peace Process in 1998. The Irish Democrat also underwent a redesign and was relaunched in April 1997. David Granville was appointed editor, before Padraig Reidy agreed to take over responsibility. The paper was redesigned again in 2004 under the editorship of Mick Hall. Like many left-wing republican organisations during this time, the politics of the peace process caused ideological friction within the group. It effectively became defunct as an active support group for the wider republican socialist movement as constitutional reformism took shape.

It follows the everyday life of Takashi Kamiyama and his odd classmates at Cromartie High School, an infamous school for delinquents. The series is a parody of Japanese \\"yankii\\" (juvenile delinquent) manga of the 1970s and 1980s. The style of art resembles Ryoichi Ikegami's works such as Otoko-gumi and Otoko ≈åzora. Both the manga and anime have been released in North America by ADV Manga and ADV Films respectively. However, the manga was not completely published in North America due to restructuring issues at ADV. Discotek Media has since licensed the anime, after ADV's closing in 2009. The series aired in the United States on the cable network G4 on its Barbed Wire Biscuit late- night block and on the UK satellite channel Rockworld TV. The manga won the 2002 Kodansha Manga Award for the sh≈çnen category. It was followed by a spin- off sequel titled Cromartie K≈çk≈ç Shokuinshitsu in 2018, which launched on Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app. Characters =Main characters= ; : : :Originally just another above-average student until he decided to enroll at Cromartie. Everyone else at Cromartie assumes that he is the toughest kid in school, since a rabbit would never go into a den of lions. He has ambitions to change the school for the sake of bettering its student body. In secret, he is an amateur comedian who writes and sends jokes to be heard on special radio stations under the penname of . In later episodes, he becomes the number one boss in Japan after winning the National Boss Championship, only winning after being the only one to answer the first question correctly. He later defeats the legendary biker Sadaharu in a race. ; : : : Kamiyama's first friend at Cromartie, noted for his purple mohawk. Hayashida is the one delinquent that helps Kamiyama blend into the bewildering environment of Cromartie High. Although streetwise, he is dumber than the gorilla and does not even understand basic math. His signature purple mohawk was revealed to be fake in episode 17, but in episode 8 one can see him take it off for a brief second. ; : : : A delinquent who claims he was always getting into fights and never lost a single one (he claims to have won a 5-against-1 fight), he is ignored and disrespected because he lacks a nickname. (In the manga, he chooses the nickname \\"Dragon of Razors\\" with the help of Hokuto's lackey, who himself decides on \\"The American Dream\\", though no one else seems to acknowledge those names.) Often the most conservative of Kamiyama's friends (and really, quite possibly the only one who actually possesses common sense), he is also frequently abducted by delinquents from Bass High School and is often the unwilling host of Cromartie High gatherings at his house. He bears a great resemblance to his mother, whose appearance normally horrifies everyone else. His name is a parody of a famous Japanese wrestler. ; : : : One of the most notorious delinquents of Cromartie. Though there is a rumor that he may be perhaps a robot, no one but the main characters (Kamiyama, Hayashida, Maeda, etc.) seems to notice, including himself. At one point he ends up in a motorcycle accident and is repaired, only to end up combined with his motorcycle into an even stronger motorcycle, complete with missiles and rocket boosters. He is also known as a smooth-talker and is considered very charismatic, regularly getting first place in popularity polls. He has a little brother, identical but one-fifth his size, named Beta, also known as Mini Mechazawa. ; : : A mute with a nearly uncanny resemblance to Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the band Queen. Hayashida claimed that as long as he attended, Cromartie would be the \\"Olympics for delinquents\\". Although he never speaks and people assume he is a mute, Freddie actually has a good singing voice and the only occasion people can hear his voice is when he sings (as seen in the manga episode of Mechazawa's birthday). The bottom of the microphone stand is broken, referring to Freddie Mercury's gimmick. He also rides to school on an incredibly large, incredibly powerful, possibly wild horse named Black Dragon (Kokuryu in Japan, a reference to Raoh's horse Kokuoh in Fist of the North Star), which waits outside the bathroom while he is \\"doing his business\\". ; : A gorilla who appears often at Cromartie High. He sometimes wears a watch and is considered smarter than most of the main characters. It has been revealed that his superior is a monkey. He is also an extremely talented sushi chef. His real name is a parody of a famous Japanese singer. He has also a sister who looks just like him but has prettier eyes and red/pink flower on her left ear. ; : : : The leader of Cromartie High's first- year students. Known to be an incredible fighter and a reliable person. His weakness (unknown to everyone else) is motion sickness. Though he loves field trips and excursions in general, he hates having to travel, because he gets sick very easily, and struggles with all of his might not to vomit. His name is a parody of a famous Japanese actor. His parents are unseen. ; : : : A son of a chairman for a major zaibatsu, who is also the chairman of the board for several high schools throughout Japan. He used his father's influence to rule every school he goes to, until he came to Cromartie, not knowing that the school is municipal. He also arrives wearing the wrong uniform (white, instead of the standard black). Despite his setbacks, he continues to plot how to rule this school, if not all of Japan or even the world. As a result of his luxurious, extravagant life, he thinks all people below him are pigs. ; : : : Nameless in the series. While he does have a name, no one seems to be interested in knowing it (including Hokuto himself), and they simply refer to him as \\"you\\", \\"other guy\\", or just \\"Hokuto's lackey\\". There was actually a controversy among the students, when he said he did not want to be called \\"Hokuto's lackey\\". Every time he tries to say his name though, something generally absurd happens and cuts the event short. In the manga, he helps Maeda come up with the nickname \\"Dragon of Razors\\", and Maeda suggests for Hokuto's lackey the nickname . They are both satisfied with their new nicknames, but no one else acknowledges them. ; : : : Before coming to Cromartie, he was a hijacker who tried to commandeer the plane that students of Cromartie High School were taking to go on a field trip to Kyushu. Being agoraphobic, he feels quite uneasy among strangers. When talking with Takenouchi about this problem, he ends up in a situation where he succeeds in the hijacking, but ends up staying in Japan. In the meantime, Takenouchi ends up in the Nevada desert in America. To maintain anonymity, he constantly wears a white wrestling mask, with the kanji character for bamboo, Á´π (The first character in \\"Takenouchi\\"), which leaves everyone in Cromartie High with the impression that he is Takenouchi, although no one questions his presence even after being seen alongside the real Takenouchi. He frequently imparts elderly knowledge (being presumedly in his 30s) to the other students when they face contentious issues. In the manga, he becomes the successor of pillow-jutsu, the fictional technique of softening pillows with a sharp blow with a long stick, but this is given only very brief mention in the opening animation of the anime. ; : : : The leader of Destrade High School's first-year students. He has the nickname of \\"The Unsinkable Battleship\\", which is coincidentally the nickname of professional wrestler Stan Hansen who is extremely popular in Japan, and is mentioned to be a member of a bike gang called \\"Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water\\" in his spare time. (\\"Ash, Wind, Fire\\" in Japan; both are parodies of an American Funk band Earth, Wind & Fire.) His cronies believe that he hates jokes, since he is always so serious. In truth, he is a connoisseur of sophisticated humor, despising the sophomoric jokes that his friends prefer. He is also a postcard comedian (someone who sends jokes in the mail to be heard on the radio). His pen name is \\"Ajishio Taro\\" (roughly, \\"Salt Boy\\"), and he is rivaled only by Kamiyama, who he initially knows only as \\"Honey Boy.\\" He is easily recognized by his large afro hairstyle and his ever- constant sunglasses. =Other characters= ; : :Yamaguchi's right-hand man, often beaten by Yamaguchi for telling crude or banal jokes, which Yamaguchi hates. ; : :One half of a comedy duo and the main character of a variety show, which is very popular among delinquents and others, but is scorned by Yamaguchi for being (in his eyes) painfully stupid. The duo wears fuzzy animal suits. ; : :Glasses-wearing partner of Pootan. He is employed in the show, but he is not allowed to talk about it. ; : : :Mother of Maeda. She only grunts in the Japanese version and never speaks in the English dub. Her face is identical to Maeda's. She apparently uses the net often, going by the name of \\"Killer Queen.\\" ; :Also known as Mini Mechazawa or just \\"Beta,\\" he is the little yet older brother of Shinichi Mechazawa. Mechazawa Beta, who can only say \\"Meka-ratta\\" despite being \\"more advanced\\", is also a cellphone. Meka- ratta is a parody of the lead character from Obake no Q-tar≈ç, a ghost who is unable to speak human language and hence can only say \\"bake-ratta.\\" Like Mechazawa, he is often mistaken for something else, such as a tea canister, and is stepped on often due to his small size. ; : :The leader of Bass High School's first-year students. His name is a parody of a famous Japanese nun. ; : :Setouchi's right-hand man. ; : :An expert ventriloquist whose puppet named Mick is newly promoted as the right-hand man by Yamaguchi. ; : :The leader of Manuel High School's first-year students. At school, he is a ruthless brawler who likes to use aggressive ways to solve problems. But at home, he is a very generous Internet user with a deep concern for netiquette. He also runs a web page/blog/forum that he frequently posts in. His polite behavior on the net, and his answering to \\"The Troll\\" (Cromartie High student Tanaka), eventually leads to the humiliating branding of Fujimoto as a shut-in (hikkikomori in Japanese). ; : :A student from Cromartie High who trolls Fujimoto's website, calling him to be a hikkikomori. He is also known as the errand boy. : :A delinquent that got left back. He is 17 years old and older than the regular students at Cromartie High. He is often referred to as \\"Mr.\\" (Parody of popular Japanese artist Ken Hirai) ; : :A big fan of Pootan. He is 10 years old and probably the youngest character. ; :A legendary biker. He soon retires after being defeated in a race on the highway by Kamiyama and Mechazawa. ; :Hokuto's butler. He seems to bear a striking resemblance to Hayashida. They might be related, though neither of them realize it. ; : A friend of Shinichi Mechazawa (when they were in 6th Garde). He goes to Bass High School. ;Mr. Imai :A man that Freddie switches places with. ;Mercury : An associate of Yutaka Takenouchi while he was a leader of the Mafia in New York. He has an uncanny resemblance to Freddie, and his name is another reference to Freddie Mercury of Queen. Unlike Freddie, however, he speaks. He also knows about Takenouchi's motion sickness. He also knows a lot of Japanese sayings despite claiming to never have been to Japan. He appears once in the manga, and in a later episode of the anime. ;Restaurant Owner : :The owner of a small sushi restaurant where the gorilla works. His shop business is going down so his son is trying to get him to sell the shop. The two of them fight until \\"Gori\\" shows them how stubborn they are with \\"banana sushi\\". ;Restaurant Owner's Son : :The son of the owner of the small sushi restaurant. He wants his dad to sell the shop until \\"Gori\\" shows how stubborn they are with \\"banana sushi\\". ;Four Kings of Cromartie :A group of second-year students and self-proclaimed leaders of all Cromartie's students, who happen to have five members. All five wear face paints, with four of them resembling members of the rock band KISS. (The final member styles his face paint after professional wrestler The Great Muta.) This group appears often in manga version, but in only one episode of the anime version. ;Fireball of Junior No. 2 :A delinquent who was said to be so bad that no one could control him. ;Hospitalizer of Junior No. 3 :A delinquent who was said to be so bad that whenever he lost his cool he would beat his opponents until they were a bloody mess. ;Masa \\"Victory by Default\\" :The delinquent who ate all of Kamiyama's pencils on the first day. He is said to be so bad that he never had to fight anyone. This is because he looked so tough that anyone he might have fought got scared and tried to get on his good side. ;Ichiro Yamamoto :A friend of Kamiyama's from middle school. He is the whole reason Kamiyama enrolled in Cromartie High School. ;Gerotan :The character of a surreal show that comes on when Pootan does not come on. He is known to throw up easily. ;Tetsuo :A character who slowly drifts into a scene in the first episode of the anime. In the last episode of the anime, he does so again, then apologizes and introduces himself. Media =Manga= Cromartie High School is written and illustrated by Eiji Nonaka.

The Eisenstein integers form a triangular lattice in the complex plane, in contrast with the Gaussian integers, which form a square lattice in the complex plane. The Eisenstein integers are a countably infinite set. Properties The Eisenstein integers form a commutative ring of algebraic integers in the algebraic number field ‚Äî the third cyclotomic field. To see that the Eisenstein integers are algebraic integers note that each is a root of the monic polynomial :z^2 - (2a - b)z + \\\\left(a^2 - ab + b^2\\\\right). In particular, satisfies the equation :\\\\omega^2 + \\\\omega + 1 = 0. The product of two Eisenstein integers and is given explicitly by :(a+b\\\\omega) \\\\cdot (c+d\\\\omega)=(ac-bd)+(bc+ad-bd)\\\\omega. The norm of an Eisenstein integer is just the square of its modulus, and is given by :{a+b\\\\omega}^2 \\\\ =\\\\, a^2 - ab + b^2 \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\tfrac14({(2a{-}b)}^2+3 b^2), which is clearly a positive ordinary (rational) integer. Also, the conjugate of satisfies :\\\\bar\\\\omega = \\\\omega^2. The group of units in this ring is the cyclic group formed by the sixth roots of unity in the complex plane: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm\\\\omega , \\\\pm\\\\omega^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, the Eisenstein integers of norm 1. Eisenstein primes Small Eisenstein primes. If and are Eisenstein integers, we say that divides if there is some Eisenstein integer such that . A non-unit Eisenstein integer is said to be an Eisenstein prime if its only non-unit divisors are of the form , where is any of the six units. There are two types of Eisenstein primes. First, an ordinary prime number (or rational prime) which is congruent to is also an Eisenstein prime. Second, 3 and any rational prime congruent to is equal to the norm of an Eisentein integer . Thus, such a prime may be factored as , and these factors are Eisenstein primes: they are precisely the Eisenstein integers whose norm is a rational prime. Euclidean domain The ring of Eisenstein integers forms a Euclidean domain whose norm is given by the square modulus, as above: :N(a+b\\\\,\\\\omega) = a^2 - a b + b^2. A division algorithm, applied to any dividend \\\\alpha and divisor \\\\beta eq 0, gives a quotient \\\\kappa and a remainder \\\\rho smaller than the divisor, satisfying: :\\\\alpha = \\\\kappa \\\\beta +\\\\rho \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{ with }\\\\ \\\\ N(\\\\rho) < N(\\\\beta). Here \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\kappa, \\\\rho are all Eisenstein integers. This algorithm implies the Euclidean algorithm, which proves Euclid's lemma and the unique factorization of Eisenstein integers into Eisenstein primes. One division algorithm is as follows. First perform the division in the field of complex numbers, and write the quotient in terms of œâ: : \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\ \\\\beta^2}\\\\alpha\\\\overline{\\\\beta} \\\\ =\\\\ a+bi \\\\ =\\\\ a+\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt3}b+\\\\tfrac{2}{\\\\sqrt3}b\\\\omega, for rational a,b\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Q}. Then obtain the Eisenstein integer quotient by rounding the rational coefficients to the nearest integer: :\\\\kappa = \\\\left\\\\lfloor a+\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt3}b\\\\right\\\\rceil + \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\tfrac{2}{\\\\sqrt3}b\\\\right\\\\rceil\\\\omega \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{ and }\\\\ \\\\ \\\\rho = {\\\\alpha} - \\\\kappa\\\\beta. Here \\\\lfloor x\\\\rceil may denote any of the standard rounding-to- integer functions. The reason this satisfies N(\\\\rho) < N(\\\\beta), while the analogous procedure fails for most other quadratic integer rings, is as follows. A fundamental domain for the ideal \\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\omega]\\\\beta =\\\\mathbb Z\\\\beta+\\\\mathbb Z\\\\omega\\\\beta, acting by translations on the complex plane, is the 60¬∞-120¬∞ rhombus with vertices 0,\\\\beta,\\\\omega\\\\beta, \\\\beta{+}\\\\omega\\\\beta. Any Eisenstein integer Œ± lies inside one of the translates of this parallelogram, and the quotient Œ∫ is one of its vertices. The remainder is the square distance from Œ± to this vertex, but the maximum possible distance in our algorithm is only \\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt3}2 \\\\beta, so \\\\rho \\\\leq \\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt3}2 \\\\beta< \\\\beta. (The size of œÅ could be slightly decreased by taking Œ∫ to be the closest corner.)  Quotient of by the Eisenstein integers  The quotient of the complex plane by the lattice containing all Eisenstein integers is a complex torus of real dimension 2\\\\. This is one of two tori with maximal symmetry among all such complex tori. This torus can be obtained by identifying each of the three pairs of opposite edges of a regular hexagon. (The other maximally symmetric torus is the quotient of the complex plane by the additive lattice of Gaussian integers, and can be obtained by identifying each of the two pairs of opposite sides of a square fundamental domain, such as .)

There are 30 species in the genus, eighteen of which are endemic to Australia although others are endemic to Pacific Islands, including New Zealand, and one is endemic to two Indian Ocean islands. They are shrubs or small trees with leaves that are arranged alternately and have white, occasionally pink flowers and a fruit that is a drupe. Description Plants in this genus are shrubs or small trees, mostly glabrous with simple leaves that are arranged alternately and often lack a petiole (although the leaves often taper towards the base). The flowers are adapted for pollination by insects and have white, (sometimes pinkish) petals and usually 4 stamens. The fruit is a drupe with its central seed surrounded by a hard endocarp and usually succulent mesocarp. Taxonomy and naming The genus Myoporum was first formally described in 1786 by Georg Forster, although he acknowledged Daniel Solander as the author. The name Myoporum is derived from the Ancient Greek myo meaning \\"to close\\" or \\"to be shut\\" and poros meaning \\"pore\\", referring to the ability of (some) plants in this genus to exist in dry areas, or possibly to the appearance of the glands on the leaves. Distribution There are 30 species in the genus, which is spread from Mauritius, across Australia to the Pacific Islands. Eighteen species are endemic to Australia. Ecology Myoporum insulare is invasive in several African countries and in the western coastal areas of the United States. In South Africa this species is known as manatoka. Some species, including M. insulare and M. laetum are known to be poisonous to stock. Use in horticulture M. parvifolium, M. floribundum and M. bateae are often cultivated as ornamentals, hedges or windbreaks. M. insulare, M. montanum, M. acuminatum and sometimes M. parvifolium are often used as rootstock for Eremophila species, especially those that are difficult to grow from cuttings or that are to be grown in heavier soils.

Lakeview Dr. A public fishing dock is to the north side of the swimming beach near the downtown. The shore is largely surrounded by homes. A large condominium, The Fountainhead, is on the east side. The only areas not surrounded by residential property are the southwest side, which is bordered by U.S. Highway 27, and an area on the north cove containing a large orange grove. The lake is almost round, with the exception of the north cove, a smaller rounded area. Lake Jackson is connected to Little Lake Jackson by a short canal. Due to the death of novelist Rex Beach in his lakefront home, the lake was renamed Rex Beach Lake in his honor, but the name did not last.

In addition to his work with the Attractions, Thomas has recorded with Billy Bragg, John Wesley Harding, Suzanne Vega, and Tasmin Archer. Thomas has also been a nonfiction writer for several decades, and is the author of Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit (1994), a biography of the renowned martial artist and movie star, and The Body of Time (and the Energies of Being), (1991), a short book about metaphysics. Rough Notes, published in 2015, is both a memoir of his time with The Attractions and a documentary history of the British music scene of the 1970s. Early life  Thomas attended Grangefield Grammar School in Stockton on Tees, and after leaving, worked as a trainee commercial-artist at the local Evening Gazette newspaper. He was playing bass in local bands at night, around his home town, and eventually joined the Roadrunners (with Paul Rodgers and Micky Moody). After Rodgers switched from playing bass to being their up-front singer, the band changed their name to The Wildflowers, and in late 1966 decided to quit their respective day-jobs and move to London. After achieving little success, the band eventually split. Bands  Thomas remained in London, playing with the bands Bitter Sweet and Bodast in the late 1960s and recording with Quiver, the Sutherland Brothers, Moonrider and Al Stewart in the early 1970s. His inventive and highly melodic bass work with Costello brought Thomas his greatest fame. Between 1977 and 1987, Elvis Costello & The Attractions released nine record albums, including This Year's Model (1978), Punch the Clock (1983), and Blood & Chocolate (1986), and toured extensively. During his tenure with the Attractions, Thomas used a wide variety of bass guitars. He at various times owned a selection of Fender Precisions, a Danelectro Longhorn and a Wal bass. After Costello's initial split with the Attractions in 1987, Thomas recorded with such other artists as Billy Bragg, John Wesley Harding, and Suzanne Vega. In 1990, he released his first book The Big Wheel, a memoir in which the key characters are recognisable without ever being identified by name. Costello, for instance, is called \\"the singer.\\" Apparently annoyed by his depiction in the book, Costello responded with the song \\"How To Be Dumb\\" on his album Mighty Like a Rose (1991). Costello has described his relationship with Thomas during this period as \\"pretty non-existent\\". Despite this estrangement, Costello was persuaded by co-producer Mitchell Froom to invite Thomas to play on the album Brutal Youth (1994). Thomas was featured on five tracks of the album. The reunited Elvis Costello & the Attractions followed the album with a tour and another album All This Useless Beauty (1996). Toward the end of a second tour, Costello announced that he would be splitting with the group as soon as the tour was over. Elvis Costello & the Attractions played their final concert on 15 September 1996, in Nagoya, Japan. Costello has said in interviews with a variety of publications, including the Rocky Mountain News, that the old animosity between himself and Thomas returned. Costello said that Thomas deliberately sabotaged some songs onstage, which was the breaking point. The other two Attractions, Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas (no relation to Bruce), have continued to tour and record with Costello as The Imposters, with Davey Faragher, formerly of Cracker, on bass. Bruce Thomas has said that he simply lost interest in playing with Costello. In an interview Thomas stated \\"no reformation is ever going to come about under my initiative ‚Äì or under any other circumstances I can foresee.\\" Honours  In 2003, Thomas was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Elvis Costello and the Attractions. Thomas appeared onstage with Costello to accept the honour, but they did not perform together. Thomas's book On the Road... Again, the sequel to The Big Wheel, was published that same year.

The film stars Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Robyn Lively, and Thomas Ian Griffith in his film debut. As was the case with the first two films in the series, it was directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Robert Mark Kamen, with stunts choreographed by Pat E. Johnson and music composed by Bill Conti. In the film, the returning John Kreese, with the help of his best friend Terry Silver, attempts to gain revenge on Daniel and Mr. Miyagi which involves hiring a ruthless martial artist and harming their relationship. The film received negative reviews, criticizing its rehashing of the elements found in the first two movies, narrative and a romance side-story, although Griffith's performance and some action scenes were praised. Plot In September 1985, John Kreese, who is now broke and destitute after the loss of his students, visits his Vietnam War comrade, Terry Silver, a wealthy businessman who founded Cobra Kai and now owns a toxic-waste disposal business. Silver vows to personally help him get revenge on Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and re-establish Cobra Kai, sending Kreese on vacation to Tahiti to rest and recuperate. Upon returning to Los Angeles from Okinawa, Daniel and Miyagi discover that the South Seas apartment complex is being demolished, leaving Miyagi unemployed and Daniel homeless. They also learn that Daniel's mother, Lucille, is currently in New Jersey taking care of Daniel‚Äôs ill Uncle Louie. Miyagi invites Daniel to stay at his house, and Daniel uses his college funds to help finance Miyagi's dream of opening a bonsai shop. As thanks, Miyagi makes him a partner at the business. When Daniel visits a pottery store across the street, he meets Jessica Andrews; though Daniel has a brief crush on her, she tells him that she has a boyfriend back home in Columbus, Ohio but they broke up before she came to L.A., but they still remain friends. Jessica decided to get back together with her boyfriend and go back to Ohio in a few weeks. Silver hires Mike Barnes, a vicious karate prospect nicknamed \\"Karate's Badboy\\", to challenge Daniel at the upcoming All-Valley Karate Tournament. Silver sneaks into Miyagi's house to gather information and overhears Daniel telling Miyagi that he will not defend his title at the tournament. Barnes and his henchmen Snake and Dennis harass Daniel in an attempt to force him to enter the tournament, but Daniel still refuses, and Barnes departs in a rage. The next morning, as Daniel and Miyagi are practicing kata, Silver interrupts their training and lies about John Kreese suffering a fatal heart attack after losing his students, and begs forgiveness for Kreese's behavior. Barnes, Snake and Dennis return to make Daniel sign up for the tournament; when Daniel again refuses, a fight ensues until Miyagi arrives and fends off the three men. After driving Jessica home, Daniel and Miyagi return to find their stock of bonsai trees missing and a tournament application hanging in place. Daniel was going to report the theft to the police, but there is nothing they could do. To replace the missing trees, Daniel and Jessica decide to dig up and sell a valuable bonsai tree that Miyagi brought from Okinawa, and planted halfway down a cliff. As they retrieve it, Barnes and his henchmen appear and retract their climbing ropes, leaving Daniel no choice but to sign up for the tournament. After pulling them back up, Barnes breaks the tree after Snake forces Daniel to hand it over by threatening to drop Jessica. Daniel returns to the shop with Miyagi's damaged bonsai, which Miyagi attempts to mend. Miyagi tells Daniel that he sold his truck to buy a new stock of trees, and refuses to train him for the tournament. Silver offers to \\"train\\" Daniel for the tournament at the Cobra Kai dojo with a series of brutal, violent, and offensive techniques. He derides Miyagi's kata forms and pressures Daniel to destroy a wooden practice dummy, causing him several injuries in the process. Throughout his training, Daniel's frustration alienates him from Miyagi. While Daniel and Jessica are at a nightclub, Silver bribes a random man into provoking a fight with Daniel, who responds by punching the man and breaking his nose. Shocked by his aggressive behavior, Daniel apologizes and makes amends with Jessica and Miyagi. Daniel visits Silver to inform him that he will not compete at the tournament, but Silver reveals his true agenda to Daniel as Barnes enters the dojo. Daniel attempts to leave, but Kreese appears to intercept him, revealing himself to have been alive all along. After Barnes viciously attacks Daniel, Miyagi intervenes and easily defeats Kreese, Silver, and Barnes. Miyagi finally agrees to train Daniel after learning of their plot. They replant the healed bonsai and begin training. At the tournament, Barnes reaches the final round to challenge Daniel. Silver and Kreese instruct Barnes to inflict serious damage on Daniel, keep the score a tie, and finally beat him in the sudden death round. Barnes gains the upper hand during the fight while taunting Daniel relentlessly. When the initial round concludes, Daniel wants to quit, but Mr. Miyagi urges him to continue. In the sudden death round, Daniel performs the kata. When Barnes lunges towards him, Daniel flips him to the ground and strikes him to win the tournament. Silver leaves in disgust while the crowd throws their Cobra Kai merchandise back at Kreese, as Daniel and Miyagi celebrate their victory with a hug. Cast * Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso * Noriyuki \\"Pat\\" Morita as Mr. Miyagi * Robyn Lively as Jessica Andrews * Thomas Ian Griffith as Terry Silver * Martin Kove as John Kreese * Sean Kanan as Mike Barnes * Jonathan Avildsen as Snake * Christopher Paul Ford as Dennis * Randee Heller as Lucille LaRusso * Pat E.

Perry as Uncle Louie * Jan T≈ô√≠ska as Milos * Glenn Medeiros as Himself * Gabriel Jarret as Rudy Production After Robyn Lively was cast as Jessica Andrews in The Karate Kid Part III in 1988, producers were forced to modify her role of protagonist Daniel LaRusso's new love interest because Lively was only 17 at the time of filming and still a minor, while Ralph Macchio was 27 (although his character Daniel is 18). This situation caused romantic scenes between Jessica and Daniel to be rewritten so that the pair only developed a close friendship. John Kreese was initially intended to have a larger role in the film, but due to Martin Kove‚Äôs filming schedule conflicts with Hard Time on Planet Earth, the character of Terry Silver was written into the script. The film featured the same crew from the first two films, except for two key people: executive producer R.J. Louis, who was replaced by Sheldon Schrager, and cinematographer James Crabe, who was forced to pull out due to the AIDS virus making him severely ill at the time, was replaced by Steve Yaconelli. On May 2, 1989, Crabe passed away from AIDS at the age of 57; the film was dedicated to his memory. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 15% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 3.93/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Inspiration is in short supply in this third Karate Kid film, which recycles the basic narrative from its predecessors but adds scenery-chewing performances and a surprising amount of violence\\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert, who praised the first two films, did not enjoy the third movie. His colleague, Gene Siskel, also did not recommend the film, though he commended the performance of Thomas Ian Griffith, which he thought was nearly enough to save it. Criticism often mentioned the rehashing of elements in the former two movies, including a tournament against Cobra Kai and a romance side-story; critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times stated that \\"writer Robert Mark Kamen gave director Avildsen and his cast too little to work with for ‚ÄúThe Karate Kid Part III‚Äù (rated a lenient PG) to have gone into production in the first place.\\" Caryn James of The New York Times was critical of the lack of character development for the film's protagonist, saying that he \\"has aged about a year in movie time and hasn't become a day smarter\\", and also nullified the film for having \\"the rote sense of film makers trying to crank out another moneymaker.\\" A 2008 DVD review of the film from Scott Weinberg of the website JoBlo said it was the installment of the series \\"where the wheels started to come off\\", remarking that it \\"approaches the Karate Kid formula as if it's the world's last home-cooked meatloaf\\", deriding the \\"cartoonishness\\" of the villains, and saying that \\"it all feels cynical and hollow...which is NOT the vibe we still get from Part 1.\\" Reviewing a 2001 UK DVD of the film, Almar Haflidason of the BBC praised the disc's picture and sound quality, but dismissed the film as a \\"desperate continuation of 'The Karate Kid' franchise [which] shudders to a pathetic halt\\" and decried its loss of \\"any warmth of the previous two films\\" At the 1989 Golden Raspberry Awards, this entry received five nominations but did not win any of them. They are for Worst Picture (Jerry Weintraub; lost to Star Trek V: The Final Frontier), Worst Screenplay (Robert Mark Kamen; lost to Harlem Nights by Eddie Murphy), Worst Director (John G. Avildsen; lost to William Shatner for Star Trek V: The Final Frontier), Worst Actor (Ralph Macchio; lost to William Shatner in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier), and Worst Supporting Actor (Pat Morita; lost to Christopher Atkins in Listen to Me). In 2015, director John G. Avildsen himself called the film \\"a poor imitation of the first one\\" and \\"a horrible movie\\".

It is to the northwest of the incorporated city of Avon Park. Maximum depth is about , with a fairly steep contour to the depth. The lake's shape is round. There were many years of drought, depleting the lake's water volume. The last two years saw more rain and a swampy area now surrounds almost all of Lake Olivia. Fishing, walking and boating are popular activities. Fishing is apparently more productive at Lake Olivia than some other lakes. Almost daily people fish the south shore and many days people fish from boats in the lake. A reviewer wrote in the Fishing Works website he always catches numerous small fish at the lake. Until recently, there was swimming at three locations. Officially swimming has not been allowed for years, although this provision has not been enforced until July 2010. Now swimming is completely forbidden. The decision by Highlands County to forbid swimming was detailed in the April 2011 Avon Park Lakes Association Newsletter: \\"It seems the county put the signs up for two reasons; 1) the lake is not routinely tested by the county for the things other lakes are tested for and; 2) there are no bathroom facilities in the area for use by swimmers.\\"Tom Singletary, \\"Lake Olivia\\", Avon Park Lakes Association Newsletter, April 2011, p. 1. For a time, some of the amenities of Lake Olivia were a bit dilapidated. An old fishing dock was removed in 2008. Between 2009 and 2012, numerous improvements were made. Amenities include three public boat ramps. One of the ramps is currently unusable, as the water level has been low since 2007. The main boat ramp, on the south side of Lake Olivia, was partially replaced in March 2012. At the same time a new and larger fishing dock was built to replace the dilapidated one removed in 2008. A paved sidewalk surrounds the lake and covers approximately 1¬Ω miles. Many of the paving slabs were replaced between 2009 and 2011. Nautilus Drive completely surrounds the sidewalk. The entire shore is public parkland. Residential houses completely line Nautilus Drive opposite the sidewalk.

The screenplay by Gene Fowler, Rowland Brown, Jane Murfin, and Ben Markson, is based on a story by Adela Rogers St. Johns and Louis Stevens. The picture's supporting cast features Neil Hamilton, Gregory Ratoff, Brooks Benedict, Louise Beavers and Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson. Plot Lowell Sherman and Constance Bennett in What Price Hollywood? Brown Derby waitress Mary Evans (Constance Bennett) is an aspiring actress who has an opportunity to meet film director Maximillan Carey (Lowell Sherman) when she serves him one night. He is very drunk but is charmed by the young girl, and he invites her to a premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Adhering to his policy of living life with a sense of humor, he picks her up in a jalopy rather than a limousine and then gives the parking valet the car as a tip. Max takes Mary home with him after the event, but the next morning remembers nothing about the previous night. She reminds him he promised her a screen test and expresses concern about his excessive drinking and flippant attitude, but he tells her not to worry. Mary's first screen test reveals she has far more ambition than talent, and she begs for another chance. After extensive rehearsals, she shoots the scene again, and producer Julius Saxe (Gregory Ratoff) is pleased with the result and signs her to a contract. Just as quickly as Mary achieves stardom, Max finds his career on the decline, and he avoids a romantic relationship with her for fear she will be caught up in his downward spiral. Mary meets polo player Lonny Borden (Neil Hamilton). He genuinely loves her and, although he is jealous of the demands made on her by her career, he convinces her to marry him, against Julius and Max's better judgment. Lonny becomes increasingly annoyed by the dedication of his movie star wife to her work, and finally walks out on her. After their divorce is finalized, Mary discovers she is pregnant. Mary wins the Academy Award for Best Actress, but her moment of glory is disrupted when she's called upon to post bail for Max after he's arrested for drunk driving. She takes him to her home, where he wallows in self-pity despite her encouragement. Later, alone in Mary's dressing room, he stares at his dissolute image in the mirror and compares it to a photograph of himself in earlier days. Finding a gun in a drawer, he kills himself with a bullet to the chest. Mary becomes the center of gossip focusing on Max's suicide. Hoping to heal her emotional wounds, she flees to Paris with her son and reunites with Lonny, who begs her to forgive him and give their marriage another chance.

(1932) The film's original title was The Truth About Hollywood. Adela Rogers St. Johns loosely based her plot on the experiences of actress Colleen Moore and her husband, alcoholic producer John McCormick (1893-1961), and the life and death of director Tom Forman, who committed suicide following a nervous breakdown. Producer David O. Selznick wanted to cast Clara Bow as the female lead, but executives at RKO's New York offices were hesitant to invest in a Hollywood story because similar projects had been unsuccessful in the past. By the time Selznick convinced them the picture had potential, Bow was committed to another film.Behlmer, Rudy, Memo from David O. Selznick. New York: The Viking Press 1972 Constance Bennett considered What Price Hollywood? her best film. Four years after the film was released, Selznick approached Cukor and asked him to direct the 1937 version of A Star Is Born starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. The plot was so similar to What Price Hollywood? that Cukor declined. RKO executives considered filing a plagiarism suit against Selznick International Pictures because of the obvious similarities in the story, but eventually opted not to take any legal action.McGilligan, Patrick, George Cukor: A Double Life (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991) Levy, Emanuel, George Cukor: Master of Elegance (New York: William Morrow & Company, 1994) Cukor went on to direct the 1954 musical version of A Star Is Born, starring Judy Garland and James Mason. Reception In a review published on December 31, 1931, Variety called the film \\"a fan magazine-ish interpretation of Hollywood plus a couple of twists\\" and added \\"George Cukor tells it interestingly. Story...has its exaggerations, but they can sneak under the line as theatrical license.\\" In the 21st century, TVGuide.com rates it three out of four stars and comments: \\"Though the conclusion is a pat romantic ending, this is a strong drama that shows the real Hollywood behind the glamorous facades.\\" According to RKO records, the film lost $50,000. Awards and honors Adela Rogers St. Johns and Jane Murfin were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Story but lost to Frances Marion for The Champ.

A ridgeway, now part of the South Downs Way, runs along the hill. It forms part of an ensemble of associated historical features created over a span of more than 2,000 years, including round barrows dating from the Bronze Age to the Saxon periods and dykes dating from the Iron Age and Roman periods. Consisting of a roughly circular low earthen rampart surrounded by a ditch, Chanctonbury Ring is thought to date to the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. The purpose of the structure is unknown but it could have filled a variety of roles, including a defensive position, a cattle enclosure or even a religious shrine. After a few centuries of usage, it was abandoned for about five hundred years until it was reoccupied during the Roman period. Two Romano-British temples were built in the hill fort's interior, one of which may have been dedicated to a boar cult. After its final abandonment around the late fourth century AD, the hill fort remained unoccupied save for grazing cattle until a mid-18th century landowner planted a ring of beech trees around its perimeter to beautify the site. They became a famous local landmark until largely being destroyed in the Great Storm of 1987. Periodic replanting on a number of occasions to replace old or destroyed trees has afforded archaeologists the opportunity to carry out a series of excavations which have revealed much about the history of the site. Description Map of Chanctonbury Ring and neighbouring archaeological features Chanctonbury Ring is in a commanding position looking across the Sussex Weald to the north, on the edge of a steep natural escarpment to the northwest and northeast. It is at the middle point of a long, narrow and otherwise treeless plateau, approached via ridges to the east and west. A trig point is located about west of the Ring, recorded by the Ordnance Survey as above sea level. Although this was originally recorded as the top of Chanctonbury Hill and thus the Marilyn summit, recent measurements suggest that the area of the Ring is higher, about above sea level. The Ring lies just to the north of an ancient ridgeway which has been in use since prehistoric times and is now part of the South Downs Way. The hill fort is roughly circular, enclosing about . The bank around the enclosure is about wide and up to high, with a circumference of about . It is surrounded by a ditch approximately wide and deep. The bank was constructed from chalk rubble, flint and clay excavated from its surrounding ditch. They would originally have been much wider and deeper, and would have had prominent lines of sight to other prehistoric landmarks in the area. The fort is defined by archaeologists as a \\"slight univallate hill fort\\", indicating a single-walled earthwork with a low rampart. The original entrance to the hill fort was provided by a gap of approximately on the south-eastern side, where the remains of a causeway are visible. Another gap through the rampart is visible on the south-western side but was probably created much later after the hill fort had gone out of use, as no causeway is visible there. The rampart and outer ditch have largely been preserved on the southern side, though slightly damaged by two small quarries dug into it. Erosion and soil creep have reduced the earthworks on the northern side and only traces remain of the ditch in this area. The perimeter and interior of the hill fort are occupied by a planted stand of beech trees. History =Origins= View of the south-west quadrant of Chanctonbury Ring, showing the bank and south-western entrance (not part of the original structure) Chanctonbury Ring was investigated by archeologists in excavations carried out in 1869, 1909, 1977 and 1988‚Äì91. Evidence for human activity in the Neolithic and early Bronze Age has been found, but not settlement or occupation. The finds consisted of tools likely to have been used for exploiting woodland. The construction of a number of barrows on the top of Chanctonbury Hill suggests that the hilltop was seen as an area of special significance, perhaps because of its high visibility. It is conceivable that the domed summit now occupied by Chanctonbury Ring was used as a site for ritual activity on account of its prominent position along the South Downs ridgeway. If so, it is conceivable that the stone tools found on the site, pre-dating the hill fort, may have been intended as ritual depositions. The hill fort was initially thought to have been built and initially occupied during the Early Iron Age, around the sixth to the fourth centuries BC. Dating evidence was provided by pottery shards and refuse pits; an animal bone found on the site was dated through radiocarbon dating to around 370 BC. However, later analysis of pottery finds suggests that its origins are significantly older and may date to the late Bronze Age, or around the seventh century BC. Chanctonbury Ring appears to have been abandoned some time around the mid- fourth century BC, but was possibly in only intermittent usage before then. The reason for its abandonment is unknown but might be linked to the construction of the much larger hill fort at Cissbury Ring a few miles away, which may have taken over some of the functions of the much older Chanctonbury Ring. The site's original purpose is unclear. Despite the martial connotations of the term \\"hill fort\\", such places were used for a wide variety of purposes, including \\"stock enclosures, redistribution centres, places of refuge and permanent settlements\\". Structures were often erected within their perimeter, such as houses, storage pits and probably raised granaries. However, archaeological evidence is lacking for the existence of such structures within Chanctonbury Ring, which would have been in an extremely exposed and windswept spot. One possibility is that it may have been used as a centre for religious activity. =Roman temples= View of the interior of Chanctonbury Ring, where the remains of two Roman temples are located a short distance below the surface Around five hundred years after its initial abandonment, Chanctonbury Ring was reused as a religious site from the mid-first century AD. At least two Romano-Celtic temples were built in the interior, probably some time during the second century, while the bank and ditch were reused to form a temenos or \\"sacred precinct\\". The remains of the temples survive principally as buried wall footings of mortared flint rubble. They are located only a few centimetres below the ground but are not visible on the surface. Mosaic fragments from Chanctonbury Ring can be found at the Horsham Museum.Horsham Museum. \\"Roman Period 43 to AD 410\\". Horsham, West Sussex, 2020. Plaque Mosaic fragments set in plaster from the temple at Chanctonbury Ring The larger of the two known temples was constructed on a west-east alignment in the centre of the fort, at the highest point on the site. It had a \\"rectangular central cella or inner chamber\\" measuring about by . An ambulatory or enclosed covered walkway enclosed it on the west, north and east sides, and was paved with a \\"rammed chalk floor\\" around wide. The ambulatory's external wall was covered with red-painted plaster. The building was entered from the east, aligning it with the original entrance to the hill fort. A small rectangular structure stood about from the north-east corner of temple. Constructed on a NNE-SSW axis, it measured about by . This has been interpreted as an oven or furnace. A large circular rubbish pit was constructed nearby. It has provided a variety of datable finds, including roof tile fragments, \\"window glass, oyster shells, pottery sherds and coins\\", analysis of which has shown that the temple was in use during an approximately 350-year-long period from the mid-first to the late fourth centuries AD. It is not known which deity the temple was dedicated to. A second temple was located around southwest of the first. Its remains are much more fragmentary as it appears to have been dismantled after falling out of use. It appears to have had a polygonal shape, measuring about on each side, with a rectangular annexe on the eastern side which had a floor made of tessellated greensand cubes. The temple may have been dedicated to a boar cult, judging from the discovery of numerous bone fragments from the heads and jaws of pigs. A copper alloy plaque of a boar found at nearby Muntham Court Romano-British site may have been associated with the cult.https://web.archive.org/web/20070823205734/http://www.romansinsussex.co.uk/level3/search/full.asp?objectnumber=24 It is not known why the Roman temples were built on the site, but there are examples elsewhere of the Romans building on the site of Iron Age temples or shrines. However, it is more difficult to argue for this being the case at Chanctonbury Ring, given the gap of half a millennium between the hill fort's abandonment and reoccupation. In other locations, such as at Hayling Island and Maiden Castle, there was continuity of religious use between Iron Age and Roman times, which was clearly not the case with Chanctonbury. The hill fort's rampart may have been refurbished when it was reoccupied, and at least one of the two nearby dykes was probably also constructed during the Roman period. The excavation of 1909 also reportedly found the remains of a \\"curious pear- shaped structure\\", but subsequent archaeological investigations have revealed no evidence of it. The site is linked via a Roman terraceway on the north face of Chanctonbury Hill to the Sussex Greensand Way, which runs parallel to the northern escarpment of the Downs. =18th century copse= View of Chanctonbury Ring and dew pond, c. 1905 After its abandonment, Chanctonbury Ring appears to have been left unoccupied and unused throughout the late Roman, medieval and early modern periods. The site lies within the estate of the Goring family of Wiston House, who have been prominent local landowners for centuries. The ring of beech trees that gave it its fame was first planted in 1760 by Charles Goring, around and just inside the ramparts. At the age of 16, he decided to beautify the site by planting it with trees, though the interior was left open at the time. He was said to have carried water up the hill each time he visited to water his trees, though some versions of the story say that he had his footmen climb the hill each day with buckets of water. His successors have continued to replant the trees ever since and have ensured that the fort remains a prominent landmark on the crest of the South Downs. =20th century= In 1909, the Gorings decided that they would also plant trees in the fort's interior. Large quantities of Romano-British pottery and building rubble were discovered during preparations for planting, prompting the first archaeological excavation of the hill fort. The two temples and a large number of artifacts were discovered. However, the planting has caused damage to the archaeology within the hill fort due to disturbances caused by tree roots. Further damage was sustained through quarrying and the hill fort's use during World War II as an anti-aircraft gun position, when four gun emplacements were constructed within its perimeter. Damage was also caused by World War II training activities, including the digging of practice slit trenches and rubbish pits on the site. Chanctonbury Ring was fenced off for a number of years after 1950 when the then owner surrounded it with barbed wire and erected a large iron water tank for cattle. This prompted controversy for blocking rights of way and harming the view, and was eventually removed. In 1977, the Goring estate set about replanting areas of the ring to replace trees which were at the end of their natural lifespan. This provided West Sussex County Council with an opportunity to carry out a further archaeological investigation of the site, which was accomplished during July and August of that year. The Great Storm of 1987 destroyed over 75% of the trees. It was decided to replant the ring and to take a fresh opportunity to investigate the ring's archaeology. Further archaeological investigations took place between 1987 and 1991 which led to a reassessment of earlier findings and a redating of the hill fort's construction to an earlier period. The replanted trees are only now beginning to restore the ring to its former glory. Other features in the vicinity =Archaeological sites= A robbed- out round barrow near Chanctonbury Ring Chanctonbury Ring comprises part of a closely associated group of archaeological sites on Chanctonbury Hill dating from the prehistoric, Roman and medieval periods. They are protected as scheduled monuments. Around to the west is a cross-dyke measuring long with a ditch on its western side. A similar crescent-shaped cross-dyke lies about the same distance to the east. The two dykes slice across the ridge on which the fort lies and are likely to be associated with its defence. While the eastern dyke is undated, the western dyke has been dated to the Roman period and represents an unusually late example of this type of structure. A number of prehistoric barrows of the saucer and bowl type and hlaews or Saxon barrows are located in the vicinity of the fort, indicating the importance of the hilltop as a place of sacred and ritual activity for at least 2,000 years. A well-preserved example of a bowl barrow, the commonest type of round barrow, is located west of Chanctonbury Ring. Three well-preserved saucer barrows and a pair of hlaews are located just to the south-east of Chanctonbury Ring and represent some of the rarest types of barrow, of which only a few dozen examples of each are known nationwide. The saucer barrows are undated but similar examples are known to date to between 1800-1200BC. Such barrows generally contain an inhumation or cremation burial with a few grave goods such as pottery, tools and personal accessories. Hlaews were built during Anglo-Saxon or Viking times for high-ranking individuals and consist of mounds generally built over graves dug into the soil below. The ones at Chanctonbury Ring have not yet been excavated. There may be additional poorly preserved barrows in the vicinity of the hill fort. A topographical survey conducted by Mark Tibble has identified fourteen landscape features which may be previously unrecognised round barrows. Some barrows have certainly been lost to erosion or ploughing, as in the case of one about further west which was excavated in the 1950s before being destroyed. It was found to contain the skeletons of an adult female and a child and fragmentary remains of a third individual, as well as a fine example of an early Bronze Age Wessex culture dagger dating to around 1800‚Äì1500 BC. The barrows around Chanctonbury Fort usually have a depression in their centre, indicating that they were robbed at some point; medieval pottery found in the destroyed barrow suggests that this took place, at least in that case, in the Middle Ages. Archaeologists have discovered very little in the other barrows, presumably due to grave-robbers. =Dew pond= Dew Pond with the Ring behind Near the trig point is Chanctonbury Dew Pond, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Constructed about 1870, it was restored by the Sussex Society of Downsmen in 1970, and is maintained by them. Legends Local legend has it that Chanctonbury Ring was created by the Devil and that he can be summoned by running around the clump of trees seven times anti-clockwise. When he appears he will offer you a bowl of soup in exchange for your soul. Frank R. Williams, writing in the Sussex Notes and Queries in 1944, argued that the story derives from ancient pagan worship which would include a ritual dance ceremony followed by a sacrificial feast. The association with Chanctonbury derives from an earlier pagan site on the land.Sussex Notes and Queries, Vol. 10, Number 3, August 1944, p. 58 The story is widely known orally with variations (such as the Devil offering porridge or milk instead of soup) but may be of relatively recent origins, with its first known appearance in print dating to Arthur Beckett's 1909 book The Spirit of the Downs. The occultists Aleister Crowley and his associate Victor Neuburg, who lived in Steyning two miles away from Chanctonbury Ring, were reportedly convinced that the site was a \\"place of power\\" for its pre-Christian religious significance. It is unclear whether they actually visited it, but Neuberg published poems about the supposed mystic power of the site and imagined gruesome Druidic sacrifices taking place there. In his 2013 travelogue The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot, Robert McFarlane gives an account of an unsettling experience sleeping out on Chanctonbury Ring one summer night, during which he is woken by unearthly screaming at 2am. The Ring is also claimed to increase fertility in women who sleep underneath the trees for one night. Access There are two car parks at the base of the hill: to the north-east on Chanctonbury Ring Road off the A283 Washington Road, and to the west on Washington Bostal just off the A24 road. The hill is located just off the South Downs Way and enjoys extensive views to the north.

The prime minister directs the executive branch along with the president, and, together with the prime minister's cabinet, is accountable to the chief of state, to the Assembly of the Representatives of the People, to the prime minister's political party and, ultimately, to the electorate for the policies and actions of the executive and the legislature. The office was established by President Habib Bourguiba with the appointement of Bahi Ladgham as the first officeholder on 7 November 1969. Although the position existed as the prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia, it was abolished when Bourguiba proclaimed the Republic on 25 July 1957. The constitution of 1959 established a presidential system where the president was both the chief of state and the head of government. Bourguiba transferred some of his powers to the Prime Minister who had a background role. After the Tunisian Revolution in 2011, the Prime Minister was granted major attributions and shares the executive authority with the president. He has major influence over domestic policies while the chief of state mainly determines foreign and defense policies. The president appoints as prime minister the nominee of the winning party in the legislative election, the one that holds the largest number of seats in the assembly. The prime minister-designate has a month to form a cabinet and submit to parliament for a motion of confidence. If obtained, the cabinet is sworn-in by the president and is accountable to him. Fifteen people have held the office since 1969. The current prime minister, Hichem Mechichi was appointed by President Kais Saied. He assumed office on 2 September 2020 after Elyes Fakhfakh announces his pernament resignation.  History  Appointment After the election, the president nominate the candidate of the party which gained the most votes to form a government within a month. The nominee must submit its program to the Assembly of the Representatives of the People and get the trust of the majority of its members before being formally appointed Prime Minister by the president. If it fails to form a government or if it does not get the confidence, the president initiates consultations with the political parties to find the best candidate. If, four months after the election, the Assembly did not give confidence in the prime minister, the president can call new election. The prime minister swears to the following oath in the presence of the president: Constitutional powers The powers of the prime minister are established by the current Constitution of Tunisia of 2014. The prime minister is primarily responsible for domestic policy, while foreign policy, defense and domestic security are handled by the president. The prime minister is responsible for: * Creating, amending and dissolving ministries (Except ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs which require the president's approval). * Creating, amending and dissolving public institutions, public entities and administrative departments. * Issuing governmental decrees after consulting the Council of Ministers. * Shall endorse and sign, where appropriate, regulatory orders issued by ministers. * Request the parliament to give vote of confidence to their government. The prime minister, together with the president, represent Tunisia at home and abroad. In the event the president is temporarily unable to carry out his duties, the prime minister serves as Acting President for a maximum of 60 days. If the disability is permanent or the result of the president's resignation or death, the president of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People becomes interim president for a period of 45 to 90 days pending new elections.

Dupuy, The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History, 4th Ed., (HarperCollins Publishers, 1993), p,638 .Laffin, John, Brassey's Dictionary of Battles, (Barnes & Noble Inc., 1998), p. 193. ) was fought on 12 August 1687 between the forces of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed IV, commanded by the Grand-Vizier Sari S√ºleyman Pa≈üa, and the forces of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, commanded by Charles of Lorraine. The result was a defeat for the Ottomans. Background The Great Turkish War began in July 1683 with an attack on Vienna by the Ottoman army. The siege was broken by the Battle of Vienna on 12 September, won by the combined forces of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nations and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, under the overall command of the King of Poland, John III Sobieski, who led the Polish forces. From September the initiative passed to the imperial troops. In the following years the Imperial Habsburg armies under Charles of Lorraine drove the Ottomans back, conquering many fortresses (such as Esztergom, V√°c, Pest). After the Battle of Buda they laid siege to and took over the former Hungarian capital of Buda. At the end of 1686 the Ottomans made peace overtures; however, the Imperial Habsburgs saw a chance to conquer the whole of Hungary and the overtures were rejected.Paul Wentzcke, Feldherr des Kaisers - Leben und Taten Herzog Karl V. von Lothringen (Captain of the Emperor: Life and deeds of Charles V Duke of Lorraine), Leipzig 1943, p. 278 In April 1687 it was decided in Vienna that further military action should be taken. The main army (of about 40,000 troops) under the command of Duke Charles of Lorraine proceeded along the River Danube to Osijek on the River Drava, while another army of about 20,000 men under the command of Elector Max Emanuel of Bavaria moved along the River Tisza to Szolnok and towards Petrovaradin. In the middle of July the two imperial armies met on the Danube and either marched overland or along the Drava to Osijek. In contrast, the Ottoman army (of about 60,000 men), under the command of the Grand Vizier Sari S√ºleyman Pa≈üa, stayed in front of the main River Drava crossing (with its 8 km-long wooden bridge) at Osijek in order to protect it, and then fortified this position. When the Imperial Habsburg army arrived, the River Drava divided the two sides. At the end of July the Imperial Habsburg army was able to make a bridgehead on the shores of the river and stood in battle array, to challenge the Ottomans. However, the Ottoman army remained passive and was satisfied with artillery bombardments of the weirs on the Drava, the bridges and the riverside. As the Duke of Lorraine realized he was not able to attack the fortified Ottoman camp, he decided to leave the bridgehead after a few days. For this he was criticized both by his own sub-commanders and by the Emperor Leopold I. The move was interpreted by the Ottoman Grand Vizier as a sign of a loss of morale by the Habsburg troops, so he decided to follow them. In early August, the Osman army drove the Habsburg army back toward Moh√°cs and an Ottoman fortified position. The Ottomans had also built a fortified position at Darda, hidden among the thick bushes so that it was not visible to the Habsburg army. For this reason Duke Charles of Lorraine did not suspect the presence of the Ottoman army in the vicinity. Battle 1732 scheme of the battle by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili. On the morning of 12 August the Duke of Lorraine decided to move to Sikl√≥s, because the position and the hard ground there made it more appropriate as a battleground. The Habsburg right wing moving westward began to march through a densely forested area. Sari S√ºleyman Pa≈üa decided that this was just the chance he was waiting for. He ordered an attack with his entire army on the imperial army's left wing, which under Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria was still in its earlier position, and which according to the Habsburg battle plan was also to start marching west. The Ottoman army caught the imperial army near Nagyhars√°ny and the nearby Nagyhars√°ny Hill, with its heavily wooded steep slopes. Their cavalry, consisting of 8000 Sipahis, tried to outflank this Habsburg army wing from the left. The commander of the wing, the Elector of Bavaria, immediately sent a courier to the Duke of Lorraine, informing him that this wing was under threat. Orders were given and sent quickly and positions were taken immediately to resist the attack of the superior Ottoman forces, which had twice the number as the Imperial forces. The Imperial infantry held their position, and Gen. Enea Silvio Piccolomini with some of his cavalry regiments successfully counterattacked and stopped the advance of the Ottoman Sipahi cavalry. Battle of Moh√°cs in 1687 by J√≥zsef Borsos (oil on canvas, 1837). The Ottoman Grand Vizier was surprised by this unexpectedly fierce resistance and ordered the cessation of the Ottoman attack. The Ottoman artillery continued to shell the Habsburg positions, but the infantry and cavalry troops were ordered to hold their positions and the infantry to go defensive behind the fortifications. This relative lull in fighting gave the right wing of the Habsburg army enough time to return to its original position. The Duke of Lorraine initially thought that his army should defend the positions, which might have led to a relative standstill. However, to gain the initiative, the Elector of Bavaria and the Margrave Louis of Baden-Baden persuaded him to order a large-scale counterattack. The deployment of the Habsburg army for this counterattack was finished at 3:00 pm. At that same time Sari S√ºleyman Pa≈üa decided to attack again alongside Mustafa Pasha of Rodosto, the commander of the Janissary. Again, Sipahis supported the Janissary infantry frontal attack by attempting to outflank the Habsburg army. Margrave of Baden-Baden successfully resisted the attack with his infantry squadrons and then went on to attack the still unfinished Ottoman defensive position. At the forefront of this Imperial penetrative attack on the Ottoman fortifications were troops under the command of the generals Rabutin and Eugene of Savoy. The Ottoman cavalry could not outflank them because the steep terrain was difficult for their horses; they had to dismount. The Ottoman attack and then resistance collapsed and this led to a retreat of the Ottoman army in a wild flight. The battle became a crushing defeat for the Ottomans. Throughout the battle only the left wing of the Habsburg army saw the main action. There was a dense forest in front of the army's right wing that prevented it from attacking. Despite this, it attempted a bypassing maneuver on the right to force the relocation and withdrawal of the Ottomans, but its columns lost their way in the forest. The losses of the Habsburg army were very light, about 600 men.Wentzcke (1943), p. 286 The Ottoman army suffered huge losses, with an estimated 10,000 dead, as well as the loss of most of its artillery (about 66 guns) and much of its support equipment. The splendid command tent of the Grand Vizier and 160 Ottoman flags fell into Imperial hands. It is reported that the value of the share of the bounty that was given to the Elector of Bavaria surpassed two million golden ducats. Aftermath After the battle, the Ottoman Empire fell into deep crisis. There was a mutiny among the troops. Commander Sari Suleyman Pasa became frightened that he would be killed by his own troops and fled from his command, first to Belgrade and then to Constantinople. When the news of the defeat and the mutiny arrived in Constantinople in early September, Abaza Siyavu≈ü Pasha was appointed as the commander and as the Grand Vizier. However, before he could take over his command, the whole Ottoman army had disintegrated and the Ottoman household troops (Janissaries and Sipahis) started to return to their base in Constantinople under their own lower-rank officers. Even the Grand Vizier's regent in Constantinople was frightened and hid. Sari Suleyman Pasa was executed. Sultan Mehmed IV appointed the commander of Bosphorus Straits K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Mustafa Pasha as the Grand Vizier's regent in Constantinople. He consulted with the leaders of the army that existed and other leading Ottoman statesmen. After these, on 8 November it was decided to depose Sultan Mehmed IV and to enthrone Suleiman II as the new Sultan.Lord Kinross, The Ottoman Centuries New York: Morrow Quill Paperbacks 1977 p. 350‚Äì351 The disintegration of the Ottoman army allowed Imperial Habsburg armies to conquer large areas. They took over Osijek, Petrovaradin, Sremski Karlovci, Ilok, Valpovo, Po≈æega, Palota and Eger. Most of present-day Slavonia and Transylvania came under Imperial rule. On 9 December there was organised a Diet of Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia), and Archduke Joseph was crowned as the first hereditary king of Hungary, and descendant Habsburg emperors were declared the anointed kings of Hungary. For a year the Ottoman Empire was paralysed, and Imperial Habsburg forces were poised to capture Belgrade and penetrate deep into the Balkans. Notes References * *Dupuy, Ernest R. and Trevor N.

History The Ordelaffi origins are unclear, but themselves claimed a lineage with \\"Lor de Laffia\\", a Germanic soldier under service to Berengar I of Italy in 889. He was appointed as governor of Forl√¨, that starting to rule itself as free commune. In 910, Lor de Laffia attempt to conquer the city, but was exiled to Ravenna. His heirs were surnamed as \\"Lordelaffi\\", \\"Ordelaf\\" and finally \\"Ordelaffi\\". =Romagna branch= In 13th century, Teobaldo Ordelaffi conquered Forl√¨, making it a Ghibelline stronghold. Teobaldo was close to the Emperor Frederick II, besieged with him Ravenna and Faenza. For compense, Frederick II appointed officially Teobaldo as Signore of Forl√¨. The son of Teobaldo, Scarpetta Ordelaffi, starting a war against the Republic of Florence in 1302, with the support of the \\"White\\" Guelphs, led by Dante Alighieri. In 1303, Scarpetta fought with the podest√† Fulcieri da Calboli for the control of Forl√¨. Finally, the Calboli lost and the Ordelaffi expelled them from the city. Later, Scarpetta conquered Bertinoro. The brother of Scarpetta, Francesco I Ordelaffi, succeeded him to rule Forl√¨, make alliance with the House of Montefeltro against the House of Malatesta, Guelph family that ruled Cesena and Rimini. Francesco II Ordelaffi, nephew of Francesco I, lost the power when Cardinald Albornoz was appointed to re-establish the papal's order in Romagna, in 1356. Surround by enemies, Francesco II lost first Faenza, then Cesena and Bertinoro in 1357. Francesco II tried to employ the Great Company's mercenaries, but Albornoz recruited them first. Defeated, Francesco II was expelled from Forl√¨ and gain only Castrocaro and Forlimpopoli. In 1376 Sinibaldo I Ordelaffi re-conquered Forl√¨ and its territories but was poisoned by his nephew Pino I Ordelaffi, who had later also poisoned Sinibaldo's son Giovanni in 1399, in order to gain Forl√¨ for himself. These murders signed the beginning of the Oderlaffi decline, though Pino's successors continued to rule Forl√¨ for some time. In 1425, after the death of Teobaldo II Ordelaffi, Forl√¨ passed under the Diocese's control. In 1433 Antonio Ordelaffi restored the signoria, but the Ordelaffi were expelled from Forl√¨ by Pope Sixtus IV, who appointed his nephew Girolamo Riario as Lord of Forl√¨ and Imola. In 1503, Cesare Borgia, styled \\"Duke of Romagna\\" only two years earlier, and his family lost their power in the Papal States, and Antonio Maria Ordelaffi gained control on Forl√¨ once more. However, only a year later, Antonio Maria die without male issue, putting an end to the Ordelaffi family line. =Venetian branch= Arms of the Faliero family. Other descendants of Lor de Laffia moved to the Republic of Venice, and changed their surname into \\"Faliero\\" or \\"Faledro\\", the inverted form of \\"Ordelaf\\". In Venice, the Faliero branch became powerful and had also two doges in the early 12th century: Vitale Faliero (1084‚Äì1095) and Ordelafo Faliero (1102‚Äì1117). In 1211, the Falieros were the first Venetian settlers in the Duchy of Candia (now Crete), starting a profitable trade with the other Mediterranean states. The family's decline began in 1355, when the Doge Marino Faliero tried to realise a coup d'√©tat in Venice and establish a monarchy, but failed and was decapitated. If there were other significant Falieros, they never expressed a Doge again and at the end of the 14th century the family disappeared.

A Vietnamese of mixed Sino-Vietnamese descent, prior to his arrival in Malaya, Lai Teck was believed to have led his life as Truong Phuoc Dat until 1934, during which Dat disappeared and Lai Teck appeared.Judge, Sophie Quinn, Ho Chi Minh: The Missing Years, 1919-1941, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2003,  Biography  Lai Teck was a shadowy character whose real name and background are unknown. He was believed to be born under the name of Hoang A Nhac or Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·∫Øc in the B√† R·ªãa (now B√† R·ªãa-V≈©ng T√†u Province) in 1901. According to his successor Chin Peng, He curiously chose the party alias 'Wright' which, given the Chinese pronunciation of English words beginning with the letter 'r' soon became distorted to Lai Te. This was further mangled, depending on who was writing or speaking English, to 'Loi Teck', 'Lai Teck' and 'Lighter'.Chin Peng, My Side of History, as told to Ian Ward and Norman Miraflor, Media Masters, Singapore, 2003, p 58. Lai Teck was believed to have served the French as a spy in Indo-China but been uncovered. It was subsequently alleged that he was recruited by the British security services and brought to Singapore in 1934 to infiltrate the CPM. In 1938, he became the Secretary- General of the Malayan Communist Party. At this he was highly successful, and by using the British police to pick off his rivals within the Party he rose through the hierarchy and attained the Party leadership (Secretary General) in April 1939. Perhaps because of this, he steered the Party on a course of non- confrontation with the British and wholly embraced the Communist International's new line of co-operation with the United States and the Western European powers against Nazi Germany and Japan. Although many of the CPM's top personnel managed to flee Singapore before it fell, Lai Teck did not and was picked up in a Japanese sweep shortly after. Although most communists were executed by the Japanese, Lai Teck walked free a few days later. Based on later evidence, including documents in Japanese archives, it now appears most likely that Lai Teck saved his life by promising to act as a Japanese agent. On 1 September 1942, more than 100 senior CPM and MPAJA members gathered at the Batu Caves just north of Kuala Lumpur for a secret conference. The Japanese, however, had been tipped off and staged a surprise raid at dawn. In the ensuing lopsided skirmish most of the CPM and MPAJA high command were destroyed. Lai Teck, who should have been at the meeting, wasn't. Subsequently, he claimed that he had been unable to attend because his car broke down.  Disappearance  In 1946, faint rumours which had been circulating within the party about disloyalty on the part of Lai Teck began to receive more substantiation. This was exacerbated by the restlessness of the rank and file, especially the younger members, who favoured radical action. Lai Teck was removed from some sensitive posts, and an investigation was begun into his activities. A full meeting of the Central Executive Committee was scheduled for 6 March 1947 at which the complaints against Lai Teck were to be aired in his presence. Lai Teck did not attend but instead absconded with the bulk of the Party's funds, hiding first in Singapore, then going to Hong Kong and later to Thailand.  Aftermath  With Lai Teck gone, the party elected a new leader, Chin Peng. According to Chin Peng, he personally went to Bangkok and Hong Kong in 1947, contacted the communist party organizations there and ask them to help him to track down and kill Lai Tech; both the Vietnamese and Thai communists assisted Chin Peng in the manhunt and eventually, Chin Peng was told by the Thai Communist leader that Lai Teck was accidentally killed in Bangkok some time when three Thai Communists tried to capture him. Lai Teck was suffocated during the struggle; he was later put into a gunny sack and tossed into the Menam River.Chin Peng, My Side of History, pp 189-190.

This technique allows hidden tracks to be encoded on LPs, 45 rpms and 78 rpms. On a disc that has a multi-groove, whether the listener plays the main track or the hidden track depends on where the stylus is cued. The most frequently cited example of a multiple-groove record is Monty Python's infamous \\"three-sided\\" Matching Tie and Handkerchief album, issued in 1973. One side of the album (both sides were labeled \\"Side 2\\") was \\"normal\\"; the other contained a pair of grooves, each of which held different material (later pressings of the record did not include the double groove). Another memorable example of a multiple-groove recording was the 1980 flexi disc entitled It's a Super-Spectacular Day issued by MAD magazine. The disc played a standard introductory section about the start of a wonderful, \\"super- spectacular\\" day, then produced one of several different comedic \\"bad\\" endings to that day, involving such topics as alien abduction, zits, street violence, and the horrors of a visiting mother-in-law. Other uses to which multiple- groove recordings have been put include various games (such as horse races or mystery games) where the outcome is determined by which of the record's multiple grooves is played. Examples Some records to have incorporated this feature, include:- * One of the earliest examples of a three-track side was a 1901 Pre-Dog Victor A-821 Fortune Telling Record. This is a multi-Track disc with three recording tracks that go all the way through the record. It is titled \\"Fortune Telling Puzzle Record a song and two Fortunes, See if you can find them.\\" * \\"The Fortune Teller Song,\\" a 1951 single by the Fontane Sisters (RCA Victor 4106), contained four different versions of the song, each with a different ending. * \\"Laura Scudder's Magic Record,\\" a 1969 record produced by George Garabedian's Mark 56 Records and offered as a promotional give-away by Laura Scudder's Potato Chips. Each side contained three different songs that would play at random depending upon the drop of the needle. https://www.discogs.com/Various-Laura-Scudders-Magic-Record/release/10469094 * \\"The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief\\" (1973), which has two grooves on side two on its original pressing. * Some editions of The Goodies' \\"The Funky Gibbon\\" single (1975) have a double grooved title track with alternative codas. * A special 12\\" version of M's single \\"Pop Muzik\\" (1979) features \\"Pop Muzik\\" and \\"M Factor\\" on one side. The single was credited on its cover as \\"The first 'Double Groove' single\\", although this claim is questionable. * John Cooper Clarke's 7\\" Splat/Twat S EPC 7982 (1979) has Twat (live recording) and Splat (censored version) on two grooves on the A side. * Henny Youngman's 128 Greatest Jokes, a 1980 Rhino Records LP, featured four-track mastering that allowed for a different random selection of Youngman's jokes to be heard each time the album was played. Rhino promoted the gimmick as \\"Trick-Track\\" recording. * The LP You're the Guy I Want to Share My Money With (1981), featuring a \\"three-track\\" side: each track contained a different recording of the title song, alternately performed by Laurie Anderson, William S. Burroughs, or John Giorno. * The 12\\" single \\"Catalogue Clothes\\" (1986) by World Domination Enterprises has a double groove on the B-side. The two tracks are different mixes of \\"Dans Une Ville. * Basia's 1987 10\\" Promises/Give me That has two grooves, Groove A is Promises (French Mix) and Groove 2 is Give me That.

The Government of Northern Territory was formed in 1978 with the granting of self-government to the Territory. The Northern Territory is a territory of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Constitution of Australia and Commonwealth law regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth. Under the Australian Constitution, the Commonwealth has full legislative power, if it chooses to exercise it, over the Northern Territory, and has devolved self-government to the Territory. The Northern Territory legislature does not have the legislative independence of the Australian states but has power in all matters not in conflict with the Constitution and applicable Commonwealth laws, but subject to a Commonwealth veto. Since 31 August 2016, the head of government has been Chief Minister Michael Gunner of the Labor Party. Legislative powers Legislative power rests with the Legislative Assembly, which consists of the Administrator of the Northern Territory and the members of the Assembly. While the Assembly exercises roughly the same powers as the state governments of Australia, it does so by a delegation of powers from the Commonwealth, rather than by any constitutional right. This means that the Australian Parliament retains the right to legislate for the Territory, if it chooses to exercise it. Under the law granting self-government to the Territory, the Federal Cabinet can advise the Governor-General of Australia to overturn any legislation passed by the Assembly. (See also Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories). Executive powers The government consists of a Ministry appointed by the Administrator, from the elected members of the Assembly. The Administrator normally appoints the leader of the majority party in the Assembly as the Chief Minister. The other members of the ministry are appointed by the Administrator on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Northern Territory Government is a member of the Council of Australian Governments. Proposed Northern Territory statehood For many years there has been agitation for statehood. A referendum was held on the issue in 1998, but the proposal was narrowly rejected. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, for opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. However, under s. 121 of the Australian Constitution, the terms of admission of new states are decided by the Commonwealth Parliament. The terms offered included an increase to three seats in the Senate from two. The other states all have 12 senators. Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then Chief Minister Shane Stone, it is thought that many Territorians were reluctant to accept statehood on the offered terms.

Within the civil parish of Cuddington are two villages: Cuddington and Sandiway. Sandiway was transferred from Weaverham civil parish in 1936. Origins The name Cuddington is Anglo Saxon and derives from the 'Tun of Cuda' which translates to the 'People of Cuda'. Cuddington was designated as a township in the 7th century when the then Archbishop of Canterbury (Theodore) introduced the parochial system within the Parish of Weaverham. Cuddington's church was first set up as a chapel of ease. In ancient times the village was famed for its medicinal spring that has since been lost. Cuddington and Sandiway have been villages since the Forest of Mondrem covered an area from Frodsham and the Mersey all the way towards Nantwich. There is a Bronze Age burial ground in Norley another local village and Iron Age hill forts at Eddisbury and Oakmere, the ancient highway of Peytefinsty, linking Weaverham with Tarporley and many other local Roman roads confirm the age of the village. Prior to 1935 the centre of Cuddington was on top of the high ground near to what is now Delamere Park but in that year it merged with Bryn (meaning 'hill' which was between Cuddington and Sandiway), Sandiway and parts of Gorstage becoming the ecclesiastical and civil parish, Cuddington and Sandiway. Vale Royal Abbey Vale Royal Abbey as it is today. The Tudor and later mansion is built around the core of the mediaeval south and west ranges of the former cloister and contains surviving rooms including the abbot's great hall. The early history of Cuddington and Sandiway is also closely associated with Vale Royal Abbey, at nearby Whitegate, once the largest Cistercian abbey church in Britain. Sandiway's most famous building is the \\"Round Tower Lodge\\" which was built in the early 19th century as the gatehouse to Vale Royal Abbey. The 18-foot high tower is said to have a concealed dungeon which was used as a hiding place by King Charles II. At that time it stood on a quiet country lane but the road became increasingly important and the tower is now a unique landmark in the central reservation of the A556. Now a listed building with a castellated top and bricked up gothic windows, it was a residence until the 1920s and had a single story extension to its east wall which has since been removed. Blue Cap Very near the round tower is the Blue Cap Inn which is named after a fox hound. The Cheshire Hounds' kennels were built in Sandiway in 1798, to be replaced in 1834, on the same site, by a new establishment, the Cheshire Forest Kennels. Bluecap was a foxhound owned by Mr John Smith-Barry and in 1762 took part in a famous race, at Newmarket, for a 500-guinea wager with Hugo Meynell, the Master of the Quorn Hunt. Bluecap prevailed and became a local hero and a monument to him stands at the Cheshire Kennels. Cuddington railway station and the Whitegate Way Cuddington railway station The railway transformed the village linking it with Manchester and Chester as well as Winsford with the Whitegate way (now closed and used by walkers, cyclists and as a bridleway). The new railway opened to passengers in 1870 shops and businesses grew up around the station. Wealthy commuters, from Manchester, Chester and Northwich, moved to the village increasing the population and changing its location for the merging in 1935. Grand houses and John Douglas John Douglas, photograph published in 1890 Oakmere Hall The wealth of these commuters can be seen in the grand houses that were built in the area. Many of the village's fine houses were designed by John Douglas who was born in Sandiway, at Park Cottage. He is regarded as one of the outstanding architects of his generation and was an unrivalled master of church design. St John's Church, Sandiway, is built on the site of which he donated to the village. He was also responsible for much of Victorian Chester including the design of the famous Eastgate Clock. Other houses in the village include Hefferson Grange, Dalefords Manor, Gorstage Hall, Sandiway Lodge, Overdale, Nunsmere Hall, Sandiway Manor, Littlefold, Pettypool House and Oakmere Hall (1867). Present day Today, Cuddington is a mainly residential village popular for its peaceful rural location and good transport links. The village is surrounded by fields and woodland with many public footpaths (like the Whitegate Way) and the nearby ancient Delamere Forest is popular with walkers and cyclists. With a railway station on the line linking Chester with Manchester situated on the crossing of two main trunk roads, Cuddington is within easy reach of the nearby cities and the UK motorway network. Petty Pool Many of the homes above have now become residential homes for the elderly. Petty Pool however has become an outdoor activity centre and college run by the Petty Pool Trust.http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/11288386.NatWest_staff_lend_a_helping_hand_to_Petty_Pool_Trust/?ref=rss Blakemere Craft Centre Situated in Sandiway the craft centre was once a farm and, after converting to a craft centre, has attracted many visitors to the area with over 25 shops including two pet shops (one specifically for dogs); eclectic art, teddy bears, traditional toys and games, chess sets, carved and turned wood items and handmade cards to mention but a few. There is an aquatic and falconry centre and garden centre. The Wilbraham family lived in the area in Delamere House from 1784‚Äì1939. Where this house once stood is now known as Delamere Park which is a prominent housing estate. John Douglas (1830‚Äì1911) architect responsible for over 500 or so buildings across Cheshire, North Wales and the North West including many of Chester's black- and-white half-timbered buildings and the world-famous Eastgate Clock. He also build the church in Sandiway on land he gave to the village. Olympic silver medalist Shirley Strong was born in Cuddington and lived in the village throughout her career. Bob Carolgees famous for Tiswas and Spit the Dog used to live on Kennel Lane in Sandiway. Gary Barlow of Take That fame once resided on the outskirts of Cuddington at Delamere Manor which was originally the home of the Wilbraham family.

The Birla House was purchased from KK Birla, in 1971, by the Government of India, after protracted and tough negotiations, in which, according to some reports, he even included the cost of fruit trees in the sale price. Eventually KK Birla, sold the property to the Government for Rs 5.4 million and seven acres of urban land in exchange, which was considered a very profitable deal. Tushar A. Gandhi, 'Let's Kill Gandhi!': A CHRONICLE OF HIS LAST DAYS, THE CONSPIRACY, MURDER. INVESTIGATIONS AND TRIAL (New Delhi, Delhi: Rupa & Co, 2007).p 570-71 Birla House opened for the public on 15 August 1973, renamed the Gandhi Smriti (or Gandhi Remembrance). The museum in the building houses a number of articles associated with Gandhi's life and death. Visitors can tour the building and grounds, viewing the preserved room where Gandhi lived and the place on the grounds where he was shot while holding his nightly public walk. Gandhi was shot during his prayers at the place where Martyr's Column now stands. The Martyr's Column now marks the place where Gandhi, the \\"Father of the Nation\\" was assassinated. The Gandhi Smriti or Birla House is located at 5 Tees January Marg, a couple of kilometres from the Connaught Place, one of the Central Business District's of New Delhi. Outside the house stands a pillar that contains a swastika symbol. The prominence of the pillar means that it has been used as a visual example of the way the ethical meaning of the swastika symbol has changed in the West in the 20th century.See, e.g., Koehler, Jr., Wallace C. and June Lester. 2007. Fundamentals of Information Studies, 2nd ed. New York: Neal Schuman Publishers, Inc. 347-48: \\"for Hindus and Buddhists, the swastika symbol is a representation of good.\\" The same pillar also contains the Sanskrit symbol for the meditation sound, Om.

She has worked on an unusually wide range of topics; the citation for her lifetime achievement award from the Association for Psychological Science states that ‚ÄúHer studies on the topics of mental imagery, face recognition, semantic memory, reading, attention, and executive functioning have become classics in the field.‚Äù Farah has undergraduate degrees in Metallurgy and Philosophy from MIT, and a doctorate in Psychology from Harvard University. She has taught at Carnegie Mellon University and at the University of Pennsylvania, where she is now Walter H. Annenberg Professor of Natural Sciences and Director of the Center for Neuroscience & Society. Early work Farah‚Äôs early work focused on the neural bases of vision and memory. In her 1990 book, Visual Agnosia: Disorders of Object Recognition and What They Tell Us about Normal Vision (MIT Press), she framed many of the questions about visual recognition that the next two decades of cognitive neuroscience research addressed. These questions include whether the human brain uses a general-purpose pattern recognition system for all classes of visual object or whether there is specialization for face recognition and/or printed word recognition, and whether semantic memory knowledge is organized in the brain by category (e.g., living vs nonliving things) or modality (e.g. visual vs motoric information). Her research revealed a striking degree of division of labor, with specialized systems for a various categories of stimuli and types of information, and was summarized in The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision (Wiley-Blackwell, 2000) and in the second edition of Visual Agnosia (MIT Press, 2004). Farah was also among the first information-processing psychologists to use the behavior of neurological patients to test cognitive theories, starting in the early 1980s. At this time, cognition was understood by analogy with computers ‚Äì mind is to brain as software is to hardware ‚Äì and the difficulty of understanding a computer‚Äôs programs by exploring the effects of hardware ‚Äúlesions‚Äù discouraged the use of neuropsychological methods in cognitive science. This criticism is only valid for certain types of computational architectures, and one of Farah‚Äôs contributions was to develop parallel distributed processing models of neuropsychological impairments. Current focus In recent years, Farah has shifted her research focus to a new set of issues that lie at the interface between cognitive neuroscience and the real world. She was an early and influential participant in the field of neuroethics, the study of the societal and ethical implications of neuroscience. She was one of the founders of the International Neuroethics Society in 2006. Farah was also on the list of special guests invited to the Bilderberg meetings in May 2008. Some of her current research concerns the interaction between poverty and brain development. In August 2009, she was appointed Director of the Center for Neuroscience & Society at the University of Pennsylvania. Since November 2010, Martha Farah is member of the Board of Director of the Society for Social Neuroscience.

It is fed by two creeks, Arbuckle Creek and Josephine Creek. The oblong-shaped lake is approximately wide by long. It is considered the fifth largest lake in the state of Florida. Despite its area, it is very shallow, with an average depth of only . Maximum depth is . As a result, boaters must be cautious to not become stranded in muck near the shore line. Bass and pontoon boats are the most commonly used watercraft, with some use of airboats. With such shallowness, this lake is extremely dangerous for boaters during windstorms, as the waves get quite high. Boating and fishing are popular activities at this lake. There are at least half a dozen fish camps on Lake Istokpoga. Several of these fish camps book visitors for fishing trips and they also have cabins and hook up for campers, for overnight stays. The amenities on the lake are 5 public boat ramps and 2 public parks, one on the lake's north side and the other on the south east corner. Most of the shoreline is undeveloped and there are two islands, Big and Bumble Bee, in the lake's interior. Some residential properties and private boat docks and beaches dot areas on the shore. Local legend is that the word Istokpoga is of the Seminole language meaning \\"a lake where someone was killed in the water\\" because a group of Seminole Indians attempted to cross the lake and were bogged in the mire and swallowed by whirlpools.

Obelisk Press) The original edition was published in Paris and identified as The Winter of Artifice, though originally titled \\"Alraune\\" in her manuscripts. She wrote this novel simultaneously as the book depicting her incestuous relationship with her father, called at the time \\"The Double\\". This Paris version contained three novelettes: \\"Djuna\\", a story that was never again reprinted; \\"Lilith\\", whose title was changed to \\"Winter of Artifice\\" in future editions; and \\"The Voice\\", whose title remained the same but whose content was heavily revised over future editions. \\"Djuna\\" is said to be a fictionalized version (what she referred to as 'caricatured') of the story eventually told in the portion of Nin's diary later published as Henry and June. Most copies of this edition were lost at the time of the death of its publisher and the beginning of World War II. 1942 Edition 500 copies, hand printed by Anais and her lover Gonzalo Mor√© (as Gemor Press), with engravings by her husband Ian Hugo (Hugh or Hugo Guiler). It contained two stories: \\"Lilith\\", retitled \\"Winter of Artifice\\" and \\"The Voice\\". 1945 Edition thumb The two \\"Father\\" sections, \\"Stella\\" and \\"Winter of Artifice\\" show how her own father, though successful as a musician, was \\"a failure as a human being\\" and the source of much of the chaos in Ana√Øs's life. She resented critics calling it autobiographical, but changing the names hardly helped. One has only one father. Most of it is taken from the Incest and Fire sections of her diaries and polished. Stella's exterior resembles the description of Ana√Øs's friend Luise Rainer in the Published Diaries. The plot is that because she had lost trust in love when her father left her family and because echoes of her love for her father clung to her, she avoided pain by choosing a superficial relationship with a Don Juan like her father. The events of Stella's love life are not from the Diaries, but most of the father's effects on Stella's personality are. The third section, ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù, is written in the form of a Surrealistic caricature of a Psychoanalytic practice in New York City. Ana√Øs had been in psychoanalysis two or three times, had briefly studied and practiced psychoanalysis and had love affairs with two of her psychoanalysts, at the time this was published. In addition to the Voice (a psychoanalyst), the main characters are Djuna and Lilith. The cover drawings and illustrations are engravings by Ian Hugo, the artist name of Ana√Øs's (first) husband Hugh Parker Guiler.

When Dufferin was only 15 his father died. In consequence he developed a very close relationship with his mother. In the course of the voyage Dufferin created a diary in the form of letters nominally written to his mother. On his return, Lord Dufferin used those letters to write a book about his travels entitled Letters From High Latitudes. Lord Dufferin commissioned the schooner Foam with the first objective of visiting Iceland. He visited the then-minuscule Reykjav√≠k, the plains of √ûingvellir, and Geysir. While Dufferin was at Geysir Prince Napoleon arrived on the yacht Reine Hortense with his entourage. Upon his return to Reykjav√≠k Dufferin was invited to join Prince Napoleon aboard his royal steamer La Reine Hortense. Prince Napoleon offered that the Foam be towed north as the French were on an expedition to the same region. The collier traveling with La Reine Hortense was damaged which required the French to abandon their investigations. Dufferin then set sail for Jan Mayen Island where he had to land by small boat. He wrote that he left a tin of trinkets on the island. From Jan Mayen, the Foam sailed to northern Norway, stopping at Hammerfest, before sailing for Spitzbergen. La Reine Hortense which afforded Dufferin assistance William Wilson - Valet, Gardener, Cape Colonist Sigurdr, son of Jonas an Icelander The schooner yacht \\"Foam\\" With its irreverent style, lively pace, and witty commentary, the book became extremely successful. It can be regarded as the prototype of the comic travelogue. It remained in print for many years with editions published in both the United Kingdom and the United States. A Canadian edition was published while Dufferin was Governor General of Canada. An abridged edition was published under the title A Cruise in Northern Seas. Translations were made into French, German and Urdu. Despite his book's great success Lord Dufferin did not pursue a career in writing. Instead, he became a diplomat, later serving as British ambassador to Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Subsequently, he was appointed Governor General of Canada and after that term became Viceroy of India. Frost On My Moustache by Tim Moore is an account of a journey in which the author attempts to emulate Lord Dufferin's fearless spirit and enthusiastic adventuring, but comes to identify far more with Dufferin's permanently miserable butler, Wilson.

He was born in the United Kingdom, and lived the majority of his life in Australia. Before adopting the on-air name of Ugly Phil he was known on-air as Phil O'Neil. Phil has hosted the Hot30 Countdown, Drive at Nova 969, and Evenings at Triple M several times. Phil also hosted a National Charts Show across the major and regional markets (\\"Ugly Phil's Hot Hits\\") previously known and currently known as The Hot Hits before and after his association with presenting the show. From December 2008 ‚Äì June 2009, he was the co-host on the breakfast shift of Triple M Sydney with Sami Lukis. Career =Radio= Early Years ‚Äì The Hot30 Countdown In 1993‚Äì94 he hosted a nightly program with his now ex-wife Jackie O (aka, Jackie Last) on Triple M in Adelaide called \\"Phil O'Neil's Hot 30\\". FOX FM snapped him up later, where he and his wife moved their popular show onto Melbourne's airwaves where it was renamed the Hot 30 Countdown. When the Austereo network decided to syndicate the show nationally, Phil and Jackie O moved to Sydney, where the show was broadcast locally on 2Day FM and across the other 5 major Australian radio markets owned by Austereo, FOX FM Melbourne, SA FM Adelaide, B105 Brisbane, NXFM Newcastle, and FM 104.7 Canberra. The Hot 30 would air between 7-10pm Monday to Friday. But on average the show go onto 10.30 pm, frustrating the host of the following shift, which was loved by Phil's listeners. During the Hot 30 between 1998 and 2000 \\"Ugly Phil\\" would often call unaware late night shop attendants at petrol stations and convenience stores and random places, with prank calls. The pranks often entailed using an \\"Asian accent\\" [\\"you eat my dog... Why you eat my dog\\"] or he would call and the first thing he would say was [\\"Who are you?...Who are you?\\"] Prior to his Hot 30 days, Phil worked at New FM in Newcastle. Nova 969 After leaving Austereo he worked briefly in the United Kingdom for Kiss 100, before moving back to Australia to host drive on the newly launched Nova 969 in Sydney. Ugly Phil had the highest rating shift on Nova in the drive timeslot. Ugly Phil left this position around the end of 2002, citing management difficulties. 2003: Return to Austereo In 2003, he signed onto evenings on the Triple M network ‚Äì ditching the 'Ugly' name and opting for The Phil O'Neil Show. The program included interviews, prizes and lighthearted talkback ‚Äì which was a first for the Triple M network. However, the experiment didn't pay off and Ugly Phil's contract was not renewed at the end of 2003 due to falling ratings and another overhaul of the network. 2004: Return to the UK In 2004, it was announced he would front the breakfast shift on the newly licensed Kerrang Radio 105.2, in Birmingham, United Kingdom with the Ugly put back onto the front of his name. This program was co-hosted by Rachel New. As of September 2007, Ugly Phil's Breakfast program has ceased, replacing his program with The Morning After starring Tim Shaw and Kate Lawler, Big Brother (TV series) 3 UK winner, in the Breakfast shift. During the autumn of 2007, Phil could be heard covering at weekends on London's indie station XFM, leading to him fronting the weekday breakfast show over Christmas and New Year, filling in for Alex Zane. July 2008: Triple M Nights In July 2008 he returned to Australian airwaves hosting a night time show on Triple M Sydney once again. . When the show commenced on this date, it was given the 6 pm to 10 pm timeslot. The title for this program is Ugly Phil ‚Äì It's A Rock Show. December 2008 ‚Äì June 2009: Triple M Sydney Breakfast On 1 December 2008, Phil hosted the Sydney Breakfast shift on Triple M, with Sami Lukis however the show was cancelled in June 2009. July 2009 to Present After the two-week non-ratings period at the end of June 2009, the Ugly Phil and Sami breakfast show did not return. On 30 June 2009, O'Neil made a return to the weekday evenings time slot.Ugly Phil ‚Äì Triple M Sydney In October 2010, despite Ugly Phil winning the ACRA award, Austereo did not renew Ugly Phil's contract for 2011 and shifted a new show called The Sweetest Plum to the night time slot on Sydney and Melbourne's Triple M. In December 2010, 96fm Perth announced that Ugly Phil would be co-hosting their breakfast program with Brad \\"Fitzi\\" Fitzgerald from January 2011. In October 2012, Ugly Phil joined Central Coast's Star 104.5FM to be a part of drive time with the station.Ugly Phil joins Star 104.5 in Drive ‚Äì dmg Radio Australia News www.dmgradio.com.au, 17 October 2011] In 2014, Ugly Phil joined Triple M Brisbane followed by moving on to do mornings on Triple M Sydney. On 12 October 2015 Ugly Phil moved over to do The Rubber Room on Triple M. In 2019, Phil returned to the UK to present the breakfast show on Fix Radio. 2020 has seen Phil standing as guest presenter on the afternoon show on Planet Rock. In July 2020, Phil returned to Australia and filled in on WSFM. =Awards and nominations= He was announced as Commercial Radio's Best Music Personality in 2000.

Written by Brent Fletcher and it was the directorial debut of David Boreanaz, who plays Angel, and was originally broadcast on January 21, 2004 on the WB network. In \\"Soul Purpose\\", guest star Christian Kane returns as Lindsey McDonald, taking on the deceased Doyle's name in an attempt to convince Spike that he is the vampire champion mentioned in the Shanshu Prophecy. Meanwhile, Angel slips into a feverish hallucinative state in which he dreams that his destiny of redemption is claimed by Spike. Plot In Angel's dream, he relives the moment in which Spike drinks from the cup that signifies he is the champion referred to by the Shanshu Prophecy. In his dream, the cup isn't a fake, and radiance shines down on Spike, then incinerates Angel in the same way the amulet incinerated Spike when he sacrificed himself in Sunnydale. Meanwhile, Lindsey approaches Spike at a strip club, implying he was responsible for Spike's return from the dead and his subsequent return to corporeality. Introducing himself as Doyle, Lindsey claims he has visions of people in trouble and that he had a vision of a girl who's about to get attacked in an alley. Spike tells him to go to Angel instead, but \\"Doyle\\" says that Angel is \\"working the other side of the tracks\\" now. Spike saves the girl, after which Lindsey suggests that Spike may be the new champion of The Powers That Be. The next night, Spike saves a couple from vampires, telling them, \\"I‚Äôm the hero.\\" Meanwhile, at Wolfram & Hart, Wesley and Gunn present Angel with possible solutions to deal with an evil warlock, but Angel - weary of the \\"gray area\\" of morality in which he constantly finds himself - announces, \\"Let‚Äôs kill them all.\\" He then says that he's just tired and the others tell him to go get some sleep. In Angel's dream, Fred says, \\"Let‚Äôs take a look under the hood.\\" She cuts open Angel's chest and starts pulling out his internal organs, including his \\"dried-up little walnut\\" of a heart. Fred also pulls out a strand of beads (which she puts on), some raisins (which she eats), and a license plate (which causes her to ask, \\"Came up the gulf stream, huh?\\" a la Jaws). She pulls out a fishbowl, calling the dead goldfish inside it Angel's soul, and says that they'll have to flush it and hands it to the bear standing next to her. Fred turns back to Angel and tells him that she can't find anything wrong with him \\"...except that you‚Äôre empty. Just a shell. I think I can hear the ocean in there.\\" The next morning, Eve gives Wesley a fragment of a relic, saying the Senior Partners want to know what it is. Gunn arrives and announces that a vampire matching Spike's description has been out on the streets, saving people. Meanwhile, Angel is dreaming that Spike and Buffy are having sex in his bed. He wakes up and goes downstairs, where Gunn tells him to hurry or he will \\"miss it.\\" Angel joins the group of people in his office, staring out the windows at L.A. as it burns. Angel realizes what's going on and heads towards the windows. \\"You‚Äôre blocking the apocalypse,\\" Harmony tells him. Wesley assures Angel that Spike will take care of it. Lorne suggests that Angel change his clothes, since there's something on his shirt. Angel looks down to see a bloody stake sticking out of his heart. As Angel dreams in his room, a blue creature feeds off of his chest in the same spot as the stake in his dream. Fred holds out a cake with a picture of L.A. burning and the words \\"Way to go Spike!\\" written on it. Everyone sings, \\"For He‚Äôs a Jolly Good Fellow\\" and yells for Spike to give a speech. He talks about fulfilling his destiny to turn L.A. into utopia. A blue fairy floats in and sprinkles gold dust on Spike, making his heart beat again. As everyone cheers for Spike, Angel is suddenly a man staffing the mail cart. In reality, Spike is at the spartan basement apartment that Lindsey provided for him, when Gunn and Wesley stop by. They tell him that if he wants to rescue people, Wolfram & Hart has resources that can help him. Spike declines the offer, saying Wolfram & Hart is the same evil law firm it's always been. At Eve's apartment, Lindsey reminds Eve if the Senior Partners find out what they're up to, they'll kill him. Eve assures him that thanks to his tattoos, they won't find him. Wesley and Gunn head back to Wolfram & Hart and tell Fred that Spike thinks they've sold out. Fred starts to go up to check on Angel, until Eve arrives, reminding her she is supposed to be testing the relic. Angel is dreaming of Lorne dressed Old West-style, playing \\"My Darling Clementine\\" on a piano in Angel's room. As Harmony (dressed like a Copacabana waitress) serves him a drink, Angel tells Lorne that everything hurts. \\"That‚Äôs life,\\" Lorne says, \\"everything hurts, and then we die,\\" though in Angel's case, everything hurts and he lives forever. Lorne tells Angel to sing, but Angel can't. Nearby, Fred, who's at a table with Wesley and Gunn, says, \\"I told you he was empty.\\" Lorne tells Angel that the crowd is turning on him as Gunn snarls and hisses at Angel. Eve appears, noting that Angel is suffering. Lorne says that Angel still has something on his shirt, and Angel looks down to see the blue creature on his chest. He pulls it off, wakes up, and kills it. Eve tells him that he's still dreaming but it's almost over. She pulls a bigger blue creature out of the box she's holding and puts it on him. She watches while he struggles against it, then leaves. At Spike's apartment, Lindsey pretends to have a vision and tells Spike that he should take care of it. Angel sits in a chair in the middle of a sunny field as the gang approach him. \\"You can stay as long as you like,\\" Wesley says. \\"Stay forever.\\" Angel says he's not done with his job, but Wesley says that he can be if he wants to. Fred says that he'll be fine - he just has to stop caring. Suddenly, the four of them throw their heads back and scream. In Angel's room, Spike grabs the blue creature and kills it. \\"No need to thank me,\\" he tells Angel. \\"Just helping the helpless.\\" Later, the gang and Eve gather in Angel's room and Wesley explains that the creature was a parasite which makes the host oblivious to its presence and causes hallucinations. If Spike hadn't killed it, Angel might have been trapped in a vegetative state. Angel says Eve put the parasite on him - after Eve put the second parasite on him, she changed her clothes so that Angel wouldn't remember her being there for real, but she didn't change her earrings. He notes that Eve is playing her own game and wonders what the Senior Partners would say if they knew. Eve says that they're all just blaming her for their problems when they should really be looking within the group. The group glares at her until she leaves. Continuity * Spike's storyline deliberately parallels Angel's storyline in the Season 1 premiere, \\"City Of.\\" * Spike met the real Doyle when he visited Los Angeles to retrieve the Gem of Amarra, but never actually learned his name, allowing Lindsey's ruse to work. * Lindsey dresses in clothes resembling Doyle's when posing as him. * Spike simultaneously stakes two vampires with concealed stakes from his sleeves, reminiscent of Angel's tactic. * Much like when Numero Cinco stopped being a hero, in Angel's dream world he becomes the new Wolfram and Hart mailman. Cultural references * Jaws: In a nightmare scene, Fred extracts a license plate from Angel's chest, a reference to this film. * Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song): In the same nightmare scene, Fred extracts Angel's soul represented as a dead goldfish in a fishbowl. * Pinocchio: In another nightmare scene, Spike is transformed into a \\"real boy\\" by a blue fairy, as in Disney's version of the fairy tale. * Miami Vice: Spike calls Wesley and Gunn \\"Crockett and Tubbs\\", the main characters from this 1980s television series. * Star Wars: Spike responds to Wesley's request to join them by calling him 'Mr Vader' and saying that he will not 'join the evil empire' * Superman: Lindsey says that Spike has not \\"sewn a big red S on his chest, but he's getting there.\\" Angel's predicament in this episode is similar to Superman's in the comic book story For the Man Who Has Everything. * Gypsy: Lorne tells Angel to 'sing out, Louise'. * M*A*S*H: The singing of \\"For he's a jolly good fellow\\" to Spike by other members of Team Angel and Wolfram & Hart employees, followed by shouts of \\"speech\\". This is reminiscent of the same song being sung in episodes of M*A*S*H by officers, followed by the shouts of \\"speech\\" in celebration of a main hero in an episode. It was common in episodes of M*A*S*H for this to take place after a commercial break (blackout) as it does in this Angel episode. Production This episode was directed by actor David Boreanaz, who plays Angel. Adam Ward, the first assistant/focus puller, says although Boreanaz \\"didn't have the cinematographer's vernacular\\", he was able to accurately describe how he wanted the scenes to look to director of photography Ross Berryman, doing a \\"phenomenal job\\" for his directorial debut. In an interview with Sci Fi Weekly, Boreanaz says some of his original ideas for this episode needed to be \\"toned down\\" by executive producer Jeffrey Bell: \\"I had to remind myself that I am shooting an Angel show and not this crazy, cinematic, swooping thing\\" although producer Kelly Manners \\"really allowed me the opportunity to do some things a first time director wouldn't normally be allowed to do.\\" Of the experience, Boreanaz says, \\"I've always been fascinated with the camera and the movement and communicating with other actors. Directing is really about telling someone to put applesauce on the table...And some people know how to do it, and some people don't.\\" The dream scenes in this episode were filmed at high speed and then slowed down in post- production. Boreanaz says, \\"It's pretty introspective of what's going on in Angel's mind...It's more of his perspective of what's going on, we don't know what's real and what's not real.\\" The scene in which Fred performs surgery on Angel is done with a prosthetic torso; Amy Acker says that scene was her personal \\"highlight of the season.\\" Boreanaz had just had reconstructive surgery on the ACL of his left knee, which is why he spends most of this episode immobilized in bed. According to the DVD commentary, the production of the \\"big parasite\\" cost $80,000. =Acting= Although Angel dreams about Buffy, the actress who portrays her is not Sarah Michelle Gellar.

Charges Of fifty-two men arrested, fifty were charged with \\"habitual debauchery\\" and \\"obscene behaviour\\" under Article 9c of Law No. 10 of 1961 on the Combat of Prostitution. Another two were charged with \\"contempt of religion\\" under Article 98f of the Penal Code. All fifty-two men pleaded innocent. Treatment of Arrest According to the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), the men were subjected to beatings and forensic examinations to \\"prove their homosexuality\\". All 52 men were kept for twenty-two hours a day in two cramped cells with no beds. Trials The Queen Boat The trials of the \\"Cairo 52\\" lasted five months and the defendants were vilified in the Egyptian media, which printed their real names and addresses, and branded them as agents against the State. The trials were condemned by international human rights organizations, members of US Congress and the United Nations. Lawyers for the defense argued that the cases should be dismissed on the grounds of false arrest, improper arrest procedures, falsified evidence and police intimidation. During the trial, homosexuality was characterized as \\"un-Egyptian\\". On November 14, 2001, twenty-one of the men were convicted of the \\"habitual practice of debauchery,\\" one man of \\"contempt for religion,\\" and another, accused of being the \\"ringleader,\\" was convicted of both charges and received the heaviest sentence, five years' hard labour. A fifty-third man, a teenager, was tried in juvenile court and was sentenced to the maximum penalty of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of probation. In May 2002, those convicted were released pending a second trial; both the guilty and not-guilty verdicts were overturned, provoking international outrage. In July 2002, fifty of the men began a second trial (the other two men had been convicted of contempt for religion, and their sentences were upheld). This trial, held at Qasr-al-Nil Misdemeanors Court in Cairo and presided over by Judge Abdel Karim, the same judge who had presided over the first trial, lasted only fifteen minutes, ending when Karim recused himself. The trial was then moved to September. The retrial ended in March, 2003. Twenty-one men were handed three-year jail sentences and twenty-nine were acquitted.

The term had been used by Washington's black AM radio stations WOL-AM and WOOK-AM since the early 1970s to refer to the city. Bobby \\"The Mighty Burner\\" Bennett, a DJ on WOL, told The Washington Post in 1998 \\"Chocolate City for me was the expression of D.C.'s classy funk and confident blackness.\\" George Clinton used the concept in the title track using the black domination of the inner city populations as a positive message in contrast to concern over White flight. The lyrics of the song refer to several such \\"chocolate cities\\" but focuses on D.C.: \\"There's a lot of chocolate cities around/We got Newark, we got Gary/Someone told me we got L.A./ And we're working on Atlanta / But you're the capital C.C.\\" Clinton's lyrics referred to Chocolate City as \\"my piece of the rock\\" as opposed to the \\"40 acres and a mule\\" that slaves were promised after the Civil War. He contrasted Chocolate City with the \\"vanilla suburbs\\" of the city, a term first used on the track. The lyrics also reflected Clinton's thanks for the capital's strong support for P-Funk, further shown by the album cover showing the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, rendered in melting milk chocolate. Other tracks on the album reflecting the influence of Washington are \\"Let Me Be\\" drawing from 1970s D.C. gospel and \\"I Misjudged You\\" a homage to The Unifics, a Washington R&B; ballad group.

Intellectual, imaginative, romantic, emotional.\\" In her 1976 preface to Delta of Venus she said \\"I had a feeling that Pandora's box contained the mysteries of woman's sensuality, so different from man's and for which man's language was inadequate.... Here in the erotica I was writing to entertain, under pressure from a client who wanted me to 'leave out the poetry.' I believed that my style was derived from a reading of men's works. For this reason I long felt that I had compromised my feminine self. I put the erotica aside. Rereading it these many years later, I see that my own voice was not completely suppressed. In numerous passages I was intuitively using a woman's language, seeing sexual experience from a woman's point of view. I finally decided to release the erotica for publication because it shows the beginning efforts of a woman in a world that had been the domain of men.\\" Susie Bright saw the results as forming part of a pioneering feminist erotica.Susie Bright ed, Totally Heterotica (1995) p. 2 and p. 150 See also *D.

Freight transport services once operated in the country, but these services were halted. However, there are plans to restore old freight services and build new lines. From a peak of , the country currently has a railway footprint of only . World War II, natural calamities, underspending, and neglect have all contributed to the decline of the Philippine railway network. The Philippine railway network consists of two commuter lines provided by the Philippine National Railways (PNR) and three mass transit lines operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority and Metro Rail Transit Corporation, all of which are located in Luzon. Within the last century, there were operating intercity rail lines extending from Manila both north and south operated by PNR. There were also lines on the Panay and Cebu islands, operated by Panay Railways, which currently does not own rolling stock or rail, only property. The government is currently expanding the railway network through numerous projects. The network is to be expanded to by 2022. History =Luzon= The \\"Ferrocarril de Manila a Dagupan\\" (ca. 1885). There has been rail transport in the Philippines for over 120 years. On June 25, 1875, King Alfonso XII of Spain promulgated a Royal Decree directing the Office of the Inspector of Public Works of the Philippines to submit a general plan for railroads on Luzon. The plan, which was submitted five months later by Don Eduardo Lopez Navarro, was entitled Memoria Sobre el Plan General de Ferrocarriles en la Isla de Luz√≥n, and was promptly approved. A concession for the construction of a railway line from Manila to Dagupan City was granted to Don Edmundo Sykes of the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan on June 1, 1887. The construction and running of the railway was done by Manila Railway Company Ltd that was a British owned company. The first rail tracks were laid in 1891 and its first commercial run was in 1892. With the American takeover of the Philippines, the Philippine Commission allowed the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company (MERALCO) to take over the properties of the Compa√±ia de los Tranvias de Filipinas, with the first of twelve mandated electric tranvia (tram) lines operated by MERALCO opening in Manila in 1905. At the end of the first year around 63 kilometers (39 mi) of track had been laid. A five-year reconstruction program was initiated in 1920, and by 1924, 170 cars serviced many parts of the city and its outskirts. Although it was an efficient system for the city's 220,000 inhabitants, by the 1930s the streetcar network had stopped expanding. At the Tutuban Central Terminal in a bustling district of old Manila was the terminal of the Philippine National Railways for two lines, to the north and to the south. From the center of Manila towards Baguio in the north, the line ended in San Fernando, La Union while the south line stopped in Legazpi in the Bicol region. To and from these points it carried people and their goods, their trade and livelihood. Most of the improvements on the rail network were destroyed during Japanese invasion of the Philippines during the World War II. Of the more than a thousand route-kilometers before the war, only 452 were operational after it. For several years after the war, work was undertaken on what could be salvaged of the railroad system. By the war's end, the tram network was also damaged beyond repair amid a city that lay in ruins. It was dismantled and jeepneys became the city's primary form of transportation, plying the routes once served by the tram lines. With the return of buses and cars to the streets, traffic congestion became a problem. In 1966, the Philippine government granted a franchise to Philippine Monorail Transport Systems (PMTS) for the operation of an inner-city monorail.Republic of the Philippines.

The monorail's feasibility was still being evaluated when the government asked the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to conduct a separate transport study. Prepared between 1971 and 1973, the JICA study proposed a series of circumferential and radial roads, an inner-city rapid transit system, a commuter railway, and an expressway with three branches. After further examination, many recommendations were adopted; however, none of them involved rapid transit and the monorail was never built.

It originally suggested a street-level railway, but its recommendations were revised by the newly formed Ministry of Transportation and Communications (now the DOTr). The ministry instead called for an elevated system because of the city's many intersections.  Creation of the Light Rail Transit Authority  President Marcos created the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) in 1980. The first lady Imelda Marcos, then governor of Metro Manila and minister of human settlements, became its first chairman. Construction of LRT Line 1 started in September 1981, test-run in March 1984, and the first half of the line from Baclaran to Central Terminal opened on December 1, 1984. The second half, from Central Terminal to Monumento, opened on May 12, 1985. Overcrowding and poor maintenance took its toll a few years after opening. With Japan's ODA amounting to 75 billion yen in total, the construction of LRT Line 2 began in the 1990s, and the first section of the line, from Santolan to Araneta Center-Cubao, was opened on April 5, 2003. The second section, from Araneta Center-Cubao to Legarda, was opened exactly a year later, with the entire line being fully operational by October 2004. Retrieved May 11, 2006 from the LRTA Website.

Attempts at rehabilitation Then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's administration (2001‚Äì2010) worked to rehabilitate rail transportation in the country, including the Philippine National Railways, through various investments and projects. Total reconstruction of rail bridges and tracks, including replacement of the current 35-kilogram (77-pound) track with newer 50-kilogram (110-pound) tracks and the refurbishing of stations, were part of the rehabilitation and expansion process. Much of those plans such as the Northrail Project were controversial and were never completed, due to allegations of being overpriced and anomalous.  Expansion  The Duterte administration is seeking to expand and rehabilitate the current rail system in Luzon. Projects include the North‚ÄìSouth Commuter Railway, a line from New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac to Calamba, Laguna, the Metro Manila Subway, a underground rapid transit line from Quezon City to Taguig and NAIA Terminal 3, the LRT Line 1 South Extension, which would extend LRT Line 1 from Baclaran to Niog, the Subic‚ÄìClark Railway, a freight line from Subic to Clark, the PNR Batangas Railway, a new branch line serving commuters to and from Batangas, and the PNR South Long Haul, a total reconstruction and expansion of South Main Line from Manila to Matnog.

The Philippine Railway Company, predecessor of the current Panay Railways, was incorporated in Connecticut on March 5, 1906. It was part of a \\"Manila syndicate\\", a collection of Philippine infrastructure companies including the Manila Electric Railway and Light Company, incorporated in New Jersey, the Manila Construction Company, and the Manila Suburban Railways Company. Later the Philippines Railways Construction Company was added. Cornelius Vanderbilt and William Salomon, among other leading American railwaymen sat on the board.

Launched in 2009, the system serves passengers to and from Naga and Legazpi, with one train a day. = Rapid transit = There are two rapid transit systems operating in the country: the Manila Light Rail Transit System, and the Manila Metro Rail System, both serving passengers in Metro Manila. Many passengers who ride the systems also take various forms of road-based public transport, such as buses, to and from a station to reach their intended destination.http://www.lrta.gov.ph/ Beep, a contactless smart card, is used to pay fares for the lines.Manila Metro Rail network map (includes proposed and under construction lines).  Manila Light Rail Transit System  The Manila Light Rail Transit System is one of the two rapid transit systems serving the Metro Manila area of the Philippines. There are two lines to the system: Line 1 and Line 2 The system is under the jurisdiction of the Light Rail Transit Authority, although the Light Rail Manila Corporation is responsible for the operations and maintenance of Line 1. Although the system is referred to as a \\"light rail\\" system, arguably because the network is mostly elevated, the system is more akin to a rapid transit (metro) system in European-North American terms. The Manila LRT system is the first metro system in Southeast Asia, earlier than the Singapore MRT by three years. Its 31 stations along over of mostly elevated track form two lines. LRT Line 1, opened in 1984, travels a north‚Äìsouth route. LRT Line 2, opened in 2003, travels along an east‚Äìwest route.

Early years Nadelman was born and studied briefly in Warsaw and then visited Munich in 1902 where he became interested in Classical antiquities at the Glyptothek. He lived in Paris from 1904 to 1914, closely involved with the avant-garde, exhibiting at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants and at the Salon d'Automne from 1905 to 1908. His first solo exhibition in 1909 at the Galerie Druet, Paris, revealed a large series of plaster and bronze classical female heads and full-length standing nudes and mannered Cubist drawings; the latter purchased by Leo Stein, who had brought Picasso to Nadelman's studio in 1908.The Sculpture of Elie Nadelman (exhibit catalogue by L.

He moved to the United States (becoming an American citizen in 1927) during the outbreak of World War I. He married Mrs. Viola Flannery, a wealthy heiress, in 1920. He and his wife assembled a large collection of folk art and erected a Museum of Folk Arts in Riverdale, N.Y. in 1925. At the same time, his own style was at times Classical, at times decorative, and at times a new kind of sophisticated urban folk art. He attempted to release large, inexpensive editions of his simple, classical, Tanagra-like small figures. All in all, Nadelman collected thousands upon thousands of folk art and added them to his vast collection.

He did not take commissions other than portraits. In 1937 the collection of the Museum of Folk Arts was sold to the New York Historical Society. He held his last one-man exhibition in 1930 (Paris, Bernheim-Jeune). In 1935 many of his plaster figures and wood-carvings were destroyed by workmen sent to remodel his studio. Nadelman packed away all his pre-1935 work in the attic and cellar of his home in Riverdale and left it there to disintegrate. After his death, in Riverdale, on 28, December, 1946, his sculpture \\"Man in the Open Air\\", was restored and reintroduced in a retrospective at MOMA, New York.

It operates a network of botanical gardens and preserves in Hawaii and Florida. History In the early 1960s a group approached the U.S. Congress to charter a tropical botanical garden on U.S. soil. In 1964, Public Law 88-449 was enacted which chartered the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden (which would later be changed to National Tropical Botanical Garden). The group is a not-for-profit non-governmental institution holding a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. The mission of the NTBG is to enrich life through discovery, scientific research, conservation, and education by perpetuating the survival of plants, ecosystems, and cultural knowledge of tropical regions. This mission would be achieved through: a network of diverse gardens and preserves in Hawai\`i and Florida, each with significant biological, cultural, and historical resources; conservation, research, and reference collections (living, library, and herbarium) assembled through discovery and collaboration; research in botany, ethnobotany, horticulture, conservation biology, and restoration ecology through programs and institutes; educational courses, publications, lectures, and visitor programs; and facilities and infrastructure to conduct this work. In 2019, they rediscovered a plant species previously deemed to be extinct, that is Hibiscadelphus woodii. Sites The rare  ª≈ålulu (Brighamia insignis) plant at Limahuli Garden NTBG is headquartered in KalƒÅheo, on the island of Kauai in the state of Hawaii. The building was originally designed by architect Vladimir Ossipoff. The Juliet Rice Wichman Botanical Research Center building constructed in 2003 under Dean Sakamoto was made of concrete to survive hurricanes. Hurricane Iniki devastated the area in 1992. Garden sites are: * McBryde Garden - Kauai island, Hawaii * Allerton Garden - Kauai island, Hawaii * Limahuli Garden and Preserve - Kauai island, Hawaii * Kahanu Garden - Maui island, Hawaii * The Kampong - Biscayne Bay, Coconut Grove, Florida Thousands of species have been gathered from throughout the tropical world, through hundreds of field expeditions by staff and through collaborations with other institutions and researchers. Its living collections include the largest assemblages of native Hawaiian plant species and of breadfruit cultivars in existence. Tours of each of the gardens are available. Preserves are also an important component of the NTBG. The preserves are seen as a refuge for nature, providing habitat for native and tropical plant species to mature and reproduce in a natural setting without the influence of human activity. They have also provided scientists the necessary means for the reintroduction of critically endangered species that are no longer found in the wild. These preserves act as large laboratories for experiments in conservation biology. The NTBG currently possesses and manages five preserves: the Lawai Preserve (adjacent to McBryde Garden on Kauai), the Ka'upulehu Preserve, which was acquired in the early 1970s on the island of Hawai'i; the Awini Preserve, which was acquired in 1975 on the island of Hawai'i; the Kahanu Preserve (adjacent to Kahanu Garden on Maui) and the Limahuli Preserve, which was acquired in 1994 on the island of Kaua'i. At present, preserves are not open to the public. Breadfruit Institute The Breadfruit Institute was created by the National Tropical Botanical Garden in 2002 to increase focus on the preservation of breadfruit germplasm and promoting the fruit as a highly nutritional answer to global food shortages. The mission of the Breadfruit Institute is to promote the conservation and use of breadfruit for food and reforestation. The Institute is taking a leading role in the conservation of breadfruit diversity and ethnobotanical research documenting traditional uses and cultural practices involving breadfruit.

Box 828 Olympia, WA 98507 (360)789-0703 (born September 29, 1961MusicBrainz), known as Wino, is an American rock singer, guitarist and songwriter. Active since 1976, when he started his first band War Horse, he is best known for being the frontman and guitarist for The Obsessed and Saint Vitus. Weinrich is also a solo artist, having released three studio albums since 2009. He has been highly influential in helping develop and codify doom metal's trademark sound,Wino: Maryland's doom-metal godfather had a pretty good year-for once  Baltimore City Paper and is also considered an influential figure in the stoner rock and punk rock genres. Biography =Early years= Weinrich approached rock music at early age. His early influences were the Monkees and the Beatles, the latter inspired him to play guitar, and later Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix and Black Sabbath. He saw Black Sabbath during the Paranoid tour and described the gig as life-changing. He also cited punk bands like the Stooges, the Dictators and the Saints as big influences. =Early career= Weinrich's musical career started out at Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School in Rockville, MD when he started his first band, War Horse. He went on to form the Obsessed in the late 70s. This version of the Obsessed would release a 7\\" entitled Sodden Jackal in 1983 on Invictus Records and have a track featured on Metal Blade Records's Metal Massacre VI. They also recorded an album entitled \\"Live at the Wax Museum\\" in 1982. In the mid 80s he disbanded The Obsessed and moved to California to sing for Saint Vitus. During this time Weinrich also briefly played bass anonymously for the MentorsRock Detector and filled in on vocals for L.A. hard rock outfit Lost Breed. In Saint Vitus he covered vocal duties as well as additional guitar work on some tracks. The band released three studio albums with Weinrich: Born Too Late (1986), Mournful Cries (1988) and V (1990), a live album (Live (1990)), and the Thirsty and Miserable EP (1987). After Saint Vitus signed to Hellhound Records, Hellhound put out The Obsessed (1990), a collection of archived Obsessed recordings. This prompted Weinrich to leave Vitus and reform The Obsessed (in between a stint with Maryland's Lost Breed), who now had a record deal with Hellhound Records. =Mid career= This incarnation of the Obsessed released some 7\\"s and two more albums: Lunar Womb (1991) and The Church Within (1994) (the latter was picked up by Columbia Records) before calling it quits in 1994. They also released a documentary video that year, featuring several musicians of the punk and metal scenes such as Henry Rollins, Ian McKaye, Phil Anselmo, Pepper Keenan and Lee Dorrian. Weinrich then formed Shine which released a single 7\\" with two songs. The band later became Spirit Caravan with ex-Wretched (another Hellhound act) vocalist Dave Sherman on bass. Spirit Caravan put out two albums Jug Fulla Sun (1999) and Elusive Truth (2001) and the Dreamwheel EP (1999) before disbanding in 2002. Weinrich joined ex-Pentagram guitarist Victor Griffin in his outfit, Place of Skulls, for one album, With Vision (2003) before leaving to start his most recent band, The Hidden Hand. The Hidden Hand released a 7\\", three studio albums, one DVD/CDEP, and a split 12\\" with Wooly Mammoth before he disbanded the group in August 2007. Weinrich performing with Saint Vitus, 2011 He was a member of a project called Shrinebuilder featuring Al Cisneros (Om and Sleep), Scott Kelly of Neurosis and Dale Crover (Melvins and Altamont) and during 2008 recorded an album of solo material entitled Punctuated Equilibrium featuring Jean-Paul Gaster of Clutch (drums) and Jon Blank of Rezin (bass guitar), which was released in January 2009 on Southern Lord records.Weinrich's page on Southern Lord Records Website Scott Weinrich's MySpace Page Weinrich contributed vocals and guitars on the track \\"The Emerald Law\\" for Dave Grohl's project, Probot. He can be seen playing guitar in the Probot video for \\"Shake Your Blood,\\" which features Lemmy on bass and vocals. He has also collaborated with ex-Death SS guitarist Paul Chain for some of his solo work. Weinrich was also the frontman for Lost Breed for a short time, a collection of recordings of this line-up has since been released, titled 'Wino Daze'. Weinrich worked with Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, Fight guitarist Brian Tilse and Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford in the band Bullring Brummies, who are featured on the Nativity in Black Black Sabbath tribute album. He also played guitar on a demo for the band \\"Gypsy Moth\\" and can be found singing and playing on the Mystick Krewe of Clearlight split CD with Acid King. Both The Obsessed and Spirit Caravan have released anthology- type albums featuring rare tracks, Incarnate (1999) and The Last Embrace (2004) respectively. = Recent activities = Since 2009, Weinrich has been touring with the reunited Saint Vitus. It was confirmed that the band would go on to record a new album in early 2011, for a release that year.Saint Vitus' Dave Chandler Discusses Reunion, Relationship with Wino, Possibility of New Album  The Obelisk Once released, it will be Saint Vitus' first since 1995's Die Healing and its first release with Weinrich since 1990's V. However, this plan fell through ever since, but the band plans to regroup to make the album sometime in summer 2011, after the band finishes their tour with Helmet and Crowbar.BLABBERMOUTH.NET ‚Äì WINO Says SAINT VITUS Will Enter Studio This Summer In 2010, Weinrich also formed Premonition 13 with guitarist Jim \\"Sparky\\" Karow. Premonition 13 released their first LP in July 2011. In a Guitar World Interview he stated that his signature sounds comes from a Gibson Les Paul guitar with DiMarzio Super Distortion Pickups plugged into a Sunn model T amp. He also changes the pre and power tubes of his amps with EH and JJ ones because \\"It's like a fuzz box built into the amp\\". In 2009, Wino released via Southern Lord records his first solo album under the name Punctuated Equilibrium. From 2010 onwards, Wino's solo material consists exclusively of acoustic material. Having released two acoustic albums so far, Adrift in 2010 and Heavy Kingdom (a collaboration with Conny Ochs) in 2012, Wino toured extensively Europe and North America as a solo artist. In 2016 he reformed The Obsessed and released Sacred the following year.

He is the frontman of his bands Festival des Maquisards and African All Stars. Mangwana was a member of Fran√ßois Luambo Makiadi's seminal band TPOK Jazz, and Tabu Ley Rochereau's bands African Fiesta, African Fiesta National and Afrisa International. History He was born on 21 February 1945 in then Leopoldville, now Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the largest city in that country. His father was a native of Zimbabwe and Sam's mother was a native of neighboring Angola. Mangwana's professional debut occurred in 1963 with the Congo-Kinshasa rumba band, African Fiesta, owned and led by Tabu Ley Rochereau. Mangwana moved across the Congo River to Brazzaville where he formed a short-lived group called Los Batchichas. He also worked with the more established Negro Band and Orchestre Tembo. He then crossed back to Kinshasa where he joined Tabu Ley, whose band was now known as African Fiesta National. In 1967, Mangwana again left to form Festival des Maquisards. The band included notable recording artists; vocalist Dalienst, guitarist Dizzy Mandjeku and lead guitarist Michelino. Two years later, Sam Mangwana was on the move again. He recorded duos with a guitarist called Jean Paul \\"Guvano\\" Vangu, until 1972. In 1972 he joined TPOK Jazz, led by the legendary Franco. Mangwana often played lead singer on compositions by OK Jazz guitarist Simaro Lutumba. His popularity increased tremendously during this time. The collaboration with Simaro yielded three extraordinary hits: \\"Ebale ya Zaire\\", \\"Cedou\\" and \\"Mabele\\". He left OK Jazz and briefly to re-joined Tabu Ley's band, now called Afrisa. He then left again, this time moving to Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire, in West Africa. In 1978 he formed, along with others, the band African All Stars. When the All Stars broke up in 1979, he became a solo artist. He recorded and toured with varying combinations of musicians. \\"Maria Tebbo\\" (1980) with remnants of the All Stars, \\"Coop√©ration\\" (1982) with Franco, \\"Canta Mo√ßambique\\" (1983) with Mandjeku, and albums with saxophonist Empompo Loway under the names \\"Tiers Monde Coop√©ration\\" and \\"Tiers Monde R√©volution\\" were highlights of his career in the 1980s. Due to his frequent goings and comings, he won the nickname \\"pigeon voyageur\\" (travelling pigeon). In the 2000s, Sam Mangwana spends most of his time in Angola, emerging periodically to perform concerts in Europe.

After several years writing stories for the small press, Blythe began his professional career writing for the Virgin New Adventures series of Doctor Who novels, for which he wrote the novels The Dimension Riders (1993) and Infinite Requiem (1995) and very soon moved on to have his own original work published. In 1998, Penguin Books published Blythe's literary thriller The Cut, the controversial story of a young woman's alienation manifesting itself in crime and violence. The Cut was followed by Losing Faith, a dark mystery in which an unnamed narrator tries to discover the truth behind his mercurial girlfriend's death. Blythe's work brought him critical acclaim from such diverse sources as The Times, which described him as 'a sharp, observant, energetic writer with a nimble sense of language', New Woman magazine, which called him 'definitely an author to be watched', and Maxim magazine, which made The Cut one of its 'Books of the Month'. Subsequently, Blythe branched out into non-fiction with 2002's The Encyclopaedia Of Classic Eighties Pop, a humorous reference guide published by Allison & Busby, which led to a stint co-presenting the music show 80s Night on BBC Local Radio in the North of England. In 2004 The Encyclopaedia Of Classic Eighties Pop was re-issued in an updated and revised paperback edition. Dadlands, an alternative handbook aimed at new fathers and based on Blythe's experiences of being a parent, came out in 2005 with John Wiley & Sons, while I Hate Christmas was published by Allison & Busby.

It was recorded at Virgin Records' Manor studios over three weeks in May and June 1973, mixed in July 1973, and released in September 1973. Content With the exception of \\"Nine Funerals of the Citizen King\\", which the whole group sings, and background voices on \\"Nirvana for Mice\\" (\\"Sweet mystery of life I will remember\\"), \\"Teenbeat\\" and \\"The Tenth Chaffinch\\", this is an instrumental album. The jazzy Canterbury sound on some of the pieces shows Henry Cow's beginnings, although they quickly moved on to establish their own unique sound. With the Yellow Half-Moon and Blue Star is a Fred Frith composition that was commissioned by the Cambridge Contemporary Dance Group under Liebe Klug, and was named after a painting by Paul Klee (\\"Avec la demi-lune jaune et l'√©toile bleue\\"). Only an extract appears on this album, but the full 16-minute version of the suite is included in The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set (2009). Parts of \\"Teenbeat\\" began in With the Yellow Half-Moon and Blue Star and parts of it were later incorporated into \\"Ruins\\" on Unrest (1974). \\"Nirvana for Mice\\" was originally called \\"Nirvana for Moles\\" during Legend rehearsals, and later became \\"Nirvana for Rabbits\\" when performed live in Hamburg in March 1976. Frith said that he used \\"chance methods\\" to compose \\"Nirvana for Mice\\" after reading works by American composer John Cage. King Crimson guitarist/vocalist Jakko Jakszyk remarked that in \\"Nirvana\\": > ... there's a whole section in the middle where it goes into 21/8 and stays > there. [Henry Cow] keep messing around with the bottom measure. They keep > flipping from 5/8 and 5/4. But, it doesn't sound like the fusion stuff that > was starting to happen ... This music sounded terribly organic. And when you > stripped it back that was when you'd realize how complicated it was. Cover art The album cover art work was by artist Ray Smith and was the first of three of his \\"paint socks\\" to feature on Henry Cow's albums. Smith had appeared with the band at several of their early 1970s concerts, performing a variety of activities, including ironing, reading text and miming with glove puppets. He suggested a woven sock on Legends front cover, and insisted that the band's name should not appear there. Chris Cutler said in a 2011 interview that Smith continued the theme on Henry Cow's next two albums, with the sock changing \\"to suit the temper of the music\\". In his book Prog Rock FAQ, Will Romano wrote that Legend \\"might [have] the most unusual and slightly amusing cover featuring a sock.\\" Smith created it with a pastry bag that he used to squeeze out long strips of acrylic paint, which, once dry, he wove together to produce the sock. He explained that the sock has no connection to the music, \\"It's an independent object\\". Smith described the picture of the sock on the album cover as \\"clear, fresh and optimistic\\" which \\"suggest[s] something electrical\\". Smith also produced a cover for Henry Cow's final album, Western Culture, but it was not used. The design illustrated an industrial city viewed from above with the text \\"Henry Cow\\" appearing in its streets. CD reissues In 1991 East Side Digital Records issued a remixed version (by Tim Hodgkinson, May/August 1990) of Legend on CD. Fred Frith collaborated with Hodgkinson on the remixes of \\"Nirvana for Mice\\" and \\"Teenbeat.\\" The CD included a bonus track, \\"Bellycan\\", which was an outtake from Henry Cow's Greasy Truckers Live at Dingwalls Dance Hall recording session in November 1973. On the remix of \\"Amygdala\\", Lindsay Cooper, who was not yet a member of the group at the time of the LP recording, played bassoon (recorded August 1990) and replaced Geoff Leigh's saxophone, which Hodgkinson felt was \\"too jazzy\\". In addition to this, there were other radical mix changes (for instance, the closing vocals of \\"Nirvana for Mice\\" were mixed prominently in the original vinyl mix but are barely audible on the CD). The remixed versions of \\"Amygdala\\" and \\"Nine Funerals of the Citizen King\\" were later reissued on the 2019 Henry Cow Box Redux: The Complete Henry Cow bonus CD, Ex Box ‚Äì Collected Fragments 1971‚Äì1978. In 1998 Recommended Records and East Side Digital reissued Legend on CD with the original mixing restored and the bonus track omitted. With the original master tape having been lost, this CD edition was transferred from a mint condition Japanese vinyl copy. Reception In a review at AllMusic, Mike DeGagne called Leg End a \\"busy musical trip\\" that produces some complicated yet interesting progressive rock. He said that while the \\"eclectic, avant garde-styled jazz movements\\" appear directionless, closer listening reveals some \\"first-rate instrumental fusion\\", although, DeGagne added, \\"a little too abstract at times\\". Music journalist Robert Christgau said the music on The Henry Cow Legend is composed to stimulate improvisation, and is \\"more flexible\\" than King Crimson's, and \\"more stringently conceived\\" than Soft Machine's. He added that as often happens with this approach, \\"not everything works\\", but \\"you can listen to what few lyrics there are without getting sick\\".

It was their second album and was released in May 1974. It was their first album including oboe and bassoon player Lindsay Cooper, who replaced saxophonist Geoff Leigh. The album was dedicated to Robert Wyatt and Uli Trepte. Content When Henry Cow began recording Unrest, they found they did not have enough composed material to fill the LP. Because of studio time constraints, they were forced to \\"improvise\\" and developed a \\"studio composition\\" process that involved improvising to tape, tape manipulation, loops, layering and overdubbing. The balance of the LP (tracks 2 to 5 on side 2) were \\"composed\\" in this manner.CD liner notes On parts of \\"Ruins\\" and \\"Linguaphonie\\", the bassoon, alto saxophone, drums and voice were recorded at half or double speed. For \\"Ruins\\", Fred Frith used Fibonacci numbers to establish beat and harmony, after reading about Hungarian composer B√©la Bart√≥k's use of the Fibonacci series. Frith said to make \\"Ruins\\" \\"somewhat classical-sounding\\" he included violin, bassoon and xylophone, but later regretted having played violin \\"so badly\\" on the track. Frith remarked, \\"it would be interesting to have another shot at it with [violinist] Carla Kihlstedt\\", but added \\"I doubt if I'll ever have the energy or motivation to go that far\\". Frith said that his composition, \\"Bittern Storm over Ulm\\" was a \\"perversion\\" of one of his favourite Yardbirds songs, \\"Got to Hurry\\" (1965) into which he added bars, beats and half-beats. Live performances of this piece were released on Henry Cow's \\"Road\\" box set under different names (\\"Heron Shower over Hamburg\\" in London in April 1974, and \\"Brain Storm over Barnsley\\" in Amsterdam in December 1977). \\"Solemn Music\\" was from Henry Cow's music for John Chadwick's production of Shakespeare's The Tempest, and is the only piece from that suite to be released. The vocal/piano piece at the end of \\"Deluge\\" is sung and played by John Greaves.

CD reissues In 1991 East Side Digital Records issued the album on CD with poor sound quality and two bonus tracks, \\"The Glove\\" and \\"Torchfire\\" (derived from raw material recorded during the Unrest sessions). A remixed version of \\"Bittern Storm over Ulm\\" appeared as \\"Bittern Storm Revisited\\" on The Last Nightingale EP in 1984. \\"The Glove\\" was later ressiued on the 2009 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set bonus CD, A Cow Cabinet of Curiosities, and \\"Torchfire\\" on the 2019 Henry Cow Box Redux: The Complete Henry Cow bonus CD, Ex Box ‚Äì Collected Fragments 1971‚Äì1978. In 1999 Recommended Records and East Side Digital issued a remastered version of Unrest on CD with the bonus tracks omitted. LP reissues In 2010 Recommended Records released a 180gr. vinyl, limited (1000 copies) edition (RERVHC2LP) of Unrest, mastered from the 1999 CD edition. Reception =Initial= Reviewing the album in Melody Maker in June 1974, Steve Lake called it \\"a great record\\" and \\"more unified and coherent\\" than Legend. He described Unrest as \\"a kind of mood cycle\\" that starts with \\"optimism, working through arid wastes that suggest hopelessness and dejection ... and ending on a note of hope with the sound of an orchestra tuning up\\". Lake said the LP's second side is \\"neither spontaneous improvisation nor 'straight' music\\" and \\"defies classification\\". He saw Henry Cow's \\"unsuppressable ... humour\\" on \\"Linguaphonie\\" as \\"cock[ing] a snook at Stockhausen\\". Lake stated that Unrest is \\"a unique statement\\" that \\"owes allegiance to nobody\\", and concluded: \\"I love this music. Approach it open- minded and you can too\\". Robert Christgau, who was notoriously unfavorable to most progressive rock, gave the album a very positive review, writing: \\"this demanding music shows up such superstar \\"progressives\\" as Yes for the weak- minded reactionaries they are.\\" He noted that on \\"Bittern Storm Over Ulm\\", which was based on the Yardbirds' \\"Got to Hurry\\", \\"they break the piece down, almost like beboppers\\" instead of \\"quoting sixteen bars with two or three instruments, thus insuring their listeners another lazy identification\\". Despite criticizing the \\"second-rate\\" saxophone and the \\"cheap swing\\" of their lyrics, he concludes that the band \\"is worthy of its classical correlatives‚ÄîBartok, Stockhausen, and Varese rather than Tchaikovsky and predigested Bach.\\" =Retrospective= In 1996, Rolling Stone critic Neil Strauss included the album on his list of the \\"100 Most Influential Alternative Albums\\" of all time. In a review for AllMusic, Rick Anderson described Unrest as \\"one of Henry Cow's better efforts\\". He called \\"Bittern Storm Over Ulm\\" a \\"brilliant demolition\\" of \\"Got to Hurry\\" by the Yardbirds, and liked the \\"stately\\" \\"Solemn Music\\" with its \\"atonal but pretty counterpoint between Frith and Cooper\\". Anderson felt that the improvised material is \\"more spotty\\", but was impressed by \\"Deluge\\" and the way it demonstrated how well the group could negotiate the \\"fine the line ... between bracing free atonality and mindless cacophony\\". A staff reviewer on Sputnikmusic gave the album a perfect score, writing that it \\"consistently progresses through unexpected levels of musicianship and creativity but never gets lost in its own mire. It's one of those albums that'll start off a track with a jazz ballad, then take five or so minutes to transform it into some sort of warped rock tune (think '60s and '70s rock music, deconstructed then thrown together so the pieces don't quite fit snugly) then, by the end, will make you wonder not only where you are but also how you got there.\\" \\"Overall,\\" he concludes, \\"Unrest is a hidden gem, one that transcends and earns all its grating moments because they're all in service of bizarrely beautiful ones.\\" In 2014, FACT Magazine ranked it the 15th best album of the 1970s, writing: > Unrest‚Äôs compositions are knotty, labyrinthine and sometimes extremely > noisy. But Unrest‚Äôs magic lies in its grace and softness. These are tricksy > compositions painted in soft autumnal shades ‚Äì dancing oboes on ‚ÄòHalf Asleep > / Half Awake‚Äô, lowing horns on ‚ÄòRuins (Part 2)‚Äô, Fred Frith‚Äôs birdsong > impressions on ‚ÄòTorch Fire‚Äô.

With agrarian origins, Bunts had a martial background and are the landed gentry of the region. The Bunts today are a largely urbanised community. Etymology The word Bunt means powerful man or warrior in Tulu language. Bunts are also referred to as okkelme, which means farmers or cultivators and references their agrarian origins. History Kodial Guthu family (circa 1900). This particular Bunt family were landlords in the city of Mangalore, India American anthropologist Sylvia Vatuk states that the Bunt community was a loosely defined social group. The matrilineal kin groups that constituted the caste were linguistically, geographically and economically diverse, which were united by their arrogation of aristocratic status and power. The Bunts speak Tulu as their native language and were traditionally an agrarian caste engaged in rice cultivation. The Bunts follow a matrilineal system of inheritance called Aliyasantana. They have 93 clan names or surnames and are divided into 53 matrilineal septs called Bari. Members of the same bari did not intermarry. According to S. D. L. Alagodi, the Bunts \\"originally belonged to the warrior class. Being the martial race of Tulu Nadu, they served the ruling chiefs which brought them considerable benefits and allowed them to become the landowners and nobles of the region.\\" Bunt clans claim descent from the ancient Alupa dynasty (circa 2nd century CE - 15th century CE). Historian P. Gururaja Bhat mentions that the Alupa royal family were of local origin possibly belonging to the Bunt caste. The title Alupa (Alva) survives till this day among the Bunts according to historian Bhaskar Anand Saletore. Some ruling and feudal clans of North Kerala adjacent to Tulu Nadu were also likely descended from Bunts. Indian anthropologist Ayinapalli Aiyappan states that a powerful and warlike clan of the Bunts was called Kola Bari and the Kolathiri Raja of Kolathunadu was a descendant of this clan. Norwegian anthropologist Harald Tambs-Lyche, states that the Bunts were warriors of the Jain kingdoms. Jainism gained a foothold in the Canara region during the rule of the Hoysala dynasty who were themselves Jains. The Hoysala Ballal kings are known to have appointed Bunts as military officers A section of Bunts believe that they were originally Jains who later became a caste group. A legend prevalent among the Bunts states that one of the Jain kings of the Bunts abandoned Jainism and took to eating peacock meat to cure a disease. Veerendra Heggade, the hereditary administrator of the Dharmasthala Temple has also publicly spoken about the Jain origin of the Bunts. Heggade is the current head of the Pattada Pergade family of Bunt heritage which continues to practice the Jain religion. The concept of personal landed property existed in South Canara district from at least the 12th century and also a military tenure not very different from the feudal system of Europe. The Bunts, being a martial caste, were exempt from paying land taxes. Around the 15th century, the Bunts had consolidated themselves as a land-owning feudal caste grouping. Bunt families controlled several villages and lived in a manor house. Several villages were generally united under a single Bunt chiefdom, and the chiefdoms had considerable autonomy despite being vassals to the Jain kings. The Bunt chiefs and petty princes became virtually independent after the rise of the Nayakas of Keladi. The Haleri Rajas, who were likely a cadet branch of the Nayakas of Keladi invited Bunt families to settle in Kodagu district after establishing the Kingdom of Coorg At the start of the 16th century, the Tuluva dynasty came to control the Vijayanagara Empire with its capital at Hampi in North Karnataka. It has been suggested by scholars Mysore Hatti Ramasharma and Mysore Hatti Gopal that the Tuluva rulers were of Bunt origin. A section of Bunts called Parivara Bunt have also traditionally claimed to be Nayaks (chieftains) of the Vijayanagara Empire. The feudal life and society of Bunt began to disintegrate in the succeeding colonial British Raj period leading to urbanisation. Religion Cult image of the deity Jumadi at the Badagumane shrine in Belle, Udupi The Bunts practice Hinduism and a section among them follow Jainism. Alagodi wrote in 2006 of the Tulu Nadu population that, \\"Among the Hindus, a little over ten per cent are brahmins, and all the others, though nominally Hindus, are really propitiators or worshippers of tutelary deities and bhutas.\\" Amitav Ghosh describes the Tulu Butas as protective figures, ancestral spirits and heroes who have been assimilated to the ranks of minor deities. The cult worship of the Butas is widely practiced in Tulu Nadu by a large section of the population. The Bunts being the principal landowners of the region were the traditional patrons of the Buta Kola festival which included aspects akin to theatrical forms like Yakshagana. Butas and daivas (tutelary deities) are not worshiped on a daily basis like mainstream Hindu gods. Their worship is restricted to annual ritual festivals, though daily pujas may be conducted for the ritual objects, ornaments, and other paraphernalia of the b≈´ta. Unlike with the better-known Hindu gods of the pura·πáic variety, buta worship is congregational and every caste in the Tulu speaking region has it own set of butas and daivas that they worship. Depending on the significance of the people who worship them, butas or daivas can be family deities (ku·π≠u·πÉbada buta), local or village deities (jageda buta, urada buta), or deities associated with administrative units such as manorial estates (Gu»õ»õus, Beedus), groups of estates (magane), districts (sime) or even small kingdoms (royal butas or rajandaivas). The deity Jumadi is cited as an example of a Rajandaiva, i.e. a royal deity who reigns over a former small kingdom or large feudal estate. Jumadi is worshiped mainly by the rich land- owning Bunts who are the chief patrons of his cult. In the myth, as well as in the religious Buta Kola dance, Jumadi is always accompanied by his warrior attendant, called Bante, who appears to be specially related to the patrons of the Bunt caste. Kodamanthaye, Kukkinanthaye, Jaranthaye, Ullaya and Ullalthi are some of the other deities from the royal Buta cult. Manor houses Kowdoor Nayarabettu: A medieval Bunt manor house. Most Bunts followed a matrilineal system of inheritance and the eldest male member in the female line was the head of the family. This head of the family was called Yajmane and he would preside over the manorial court during the feudal era. The Nadibettu Aramane house in Shirva was built in the 14th century and has copper plate inscriptions of the Vijayanagara Empire Chavadi Aramane of Nandalike, the manorial house of the Heggade chieftaincy has inscriptions from the 16th century. Suralu Aramane of the Tolaha dynasty is another house of chieftains in Udupi district; it dates from the 15th century. The Suralu Mud Palace is currently under the ownership of Sudarshan Shetty, a descendant of the Tolahas who is leading a restoration project. The Suralu Palace is a State protected Monument which was partially restored in 2016 with help from the Government of Karnataka Some other houses of the Bunts that preserve medieval architecture include the Kodial Guthu house of Mangalore. Badila Guthu in Kannur, Shetty Bettu, Puthige Guthu, Markada Guthu and Kodethur Guthu Organisation The traditional community council of the Bunts have been replaced by a body of elected members called the Buntara Yane Nadavara Mathr Sangha (Bunt and Nadava Association). It was established in 1908 in Mangalore and has been called the apex body of the Bunt community by The Hindu newspaper. Similar regional and international organisations operate in areas where the Bunts have migrated. The Bunt association, including its regional bodies, also runs schools, colleges, hostels and dispensaries.  Varna Classification  The traditional chaturvarna system is largely not found in South India. Bunts were classified as Sat-Shudras or Upper Shudras. In Southern India, the upper Shudras were generally the landholding ruling classes of South India and occupied and controlled similar spaces of power as the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas in North India.

Biography Born in Monkwearmouth, Sunderland,ODNB Wallas was the older brother of Katharine, later to become a politician. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. It was at Oxford that Wallas abandoned his religion. He taught at Highgate School until 1885, when he resigned rather than participate in communion, and was President of the Rationalist Press Association.ODNB Wallas joined the Fabian Society in April 1886, following his acquaintances Sidney Webb and George Bernard Shaw. He was to resign in 1904 in protest at Fabian support for Joseph Chamberlain's tariff policy. In 1894 he was elected to the London School Board as a Progressive.ODNB On 18 December 1897 he married the socialist writer Ada Radford.

It was recorded at Virgin Records' Manor Studio and Nova Sound Studios in November 1974, and released in February 1975. It was Slapp Happy's second album for Virgin, and they had invited Henry Cow to record with them. Content The album is a blend of Henry Cow's avant- garde music and Slapp Happy's nostalgic pop, and the success of this collaboration led to the two bands merging and recording In Praise of Learning in 1975. \\"Europa\\" and \\"War (Is Energy Enslaved)\\" were recorded for a single by Slapp Happy with session musicians in May 1974, but it was not released. The two songs were re-recorded with Henry Cow for this album. \\"War\\" was released later on Slapp Happy and Henry Cow's second collaborative album In Praise of Learning. The lyrics of the song \\"A Worm Is at Work\\" refers to the song \\"War\\", and the lyrics of \\"Europa\\" relates to William Blake's Europe a Prophecy (1794).

Reception In a review of Desperate Straights at AllMusic, Ted Mills described the album as \\"surprisingly melodic\\", given the musicians behind it. He said it is \\"light on the art-school angst and heavy on the playfulness\\". \\"Some Questions About Hats\\" reminded Mills of Kurt Weill, while Blegvad's \\"Strayed\\" sounded like Kevin Ayers art rock. Reviewing the album at Pitchfork Media, Dominique Leone felt that even though Henry Cow features prominently in the recording's baroque sound, it is Moore and Blegvad's songs that \\"steal the show\\". They use \\"delicate\\" instruments ‚Äì \\"soft\\" piano, brushed cymbals, violin, clarinet ‚Äì and are closer to Weill and art song than contemporary pop music. Leone recommended Desperate Straights to \\"anyone into pushing the chamber-pop envelope\\". Pete Erskine wrote in New Musical Express in April 1975 that \\"Desperate Straights cannot be recommended too highly\\". He described the album as \\"an extended lament intended to awaken the wearers of rose-tinted spectacles\\".

The state of Clear is reached when a person becomes free of the influence of engrams, unwanted emotions or painful traumas not readily available to the conscious mind. Scientologists believe that human beings accumulate anxieties, psychosomatic illnesses, and aberration due to receiving engrams throughout their current or past lives, and that by applying Dianetics, every single person can reach the state of Clear.Goldstein, Laurie. \\"Defectors Say Church of Scientology Hides Abuse\\", The New York Times, March 6, 2010. A Clear is defined by the Church of Scientology as person who no longer has a \\"reactive mind\\", and is therefore free from the reactive mind's negative effects. A Clear is said to be \\"at cause over\\" (that is, in control of) their \\"mental energy\\" (their thoughts), and able to think clearly even when faced with the very situations that in earlier times caused them difficulty. The next level of spiritual development is that of an Operating Thetan. A person who has not reached a state of Clear is called a \\"pre-clear.\\"Bromley, David G. \\"Making Sense of Scientology\\", in James R. Lewis. Scientology. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 92. Dianetics states that a person's awareness is influenced by the stimulus-response nature of the reactive mind. Achieving the state of Clear means a person has overcome the reactive mind and is in complete control of their analytical mind. According to Hubbard: \\"A Clear is a being who no longer has his own reactive mind, and therefore suffers none of the ill effects the reactive mind can cause. The Clear has no engrams which, when restimulated, throw out the correctness of his computations by entering hidden and false data.\\"What is Scientology web site Sociologist Roy Wallis noted, ‚ÄúBeing Clear meant being able to do all those things which one could currently not do, and to which one aspired so desperately.‚Äù It is estimated that the cost of reaching the Clear state in Scientology is $128,000.How Much Does Scientology Cost? The state of Clear In Dianetics, L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, states that becoming a Clear strengthens a person's native individuality and creativity, and that a Clear is free with his emotions. In The State Of Clear, a Clear is defined as \\"a being who no longer has his own reactive mind, and therefore suffers none of the ill effects the reactive mind can cause\\".The State Of Clear: Catechism of Scientology official web site Hubbard states that merely knowing what the cognition is does not have the effect of realizing it for oneself: Hubbard described Clears as having \\"an awareness which can create energy at will, and can handle and control, erase or re-create an analytical or reactive mind\\". Hubbard claimed that Clears have complete memories and know why events in their lives have happened, which leaves them free to pursue their goals without hindrances (the \\"reactive mind\\") emanating from past experiences. Religious scholar Pat Cook compared being \\"Clear\\" to the concept of nirvana in Zen Buddhism: like nirvana in Buddhism, Clear is a state of being that is highly desired and respected in Scientology. The Clear state is said to be achieved through the Scientology practice of auditing. A person undergoing auditing is called a \\"pre-clear\\", often abbreviated to \\"PC\\", in Scientology terminology. The Church of Scientology claims that if all individuals in the world were ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, the world would be ‚Äúfree of drugs, war, pollution, crime, mental illness and other ills.‚Äù Steps after Clear After attaining the state of Clear, a person may go on to study the Operating Thetan levels, which are described in Scientology materials as states where the ability to operate outside the body via \\"exteriorization\\" becomes commonplace. Beyond that comes \\"Cleared Theta Clear\\", which Hubbard describes this way: > A thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan > should do, such as move MEST [matter, energy, space, and time] and control > others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to > create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create > illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects > without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the > MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in > existence.Hubbard, Scientology 8-8008, p. 114 (1st ed.), p. 151 (1990 ed.) Early Clears There are several conflicting accounts of who first attained the state of Clear, and under what circumstances. In August 1950, amidst the success of Dianetics, Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianchi to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as \\"the world's first Clear.\\" Science-fiction author Arthur Jean Cox's April 1952 letter to skeptic Martin Gardner would later claim that the event was a \\"fiasco\\", which Gardner repeated: \\"in the demonstration that followed, she failed to remember a single formula in physics (the subject in which she was majoring) or the color of Hubbard's tie when his back was turned. At this point, a large part of the audience got up and left.\\"Gardner, p. 270 Cox had also claimed that Bianchi was unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie. Parade magazine, published two months after the event, wrote: \\"Other reports are even more impressive. Sonya Bianchi, a favorite student of founder Hubbard, and a winsome graduate student at Wellesley College, made this report to 6,000 dianetics enthusiasts in Los Angeles: 'I had violent sinus trouble. I also had a strange and embarrassing allergy to fresh paint for days after I came in contact with it. I had a painful itching in my eyebrows. Both conditions have cleared up, and I feel like a million dollars.' End of Bianchi‚Äôs report.\\" Later, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianchi as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working incognito in Hollywood posing as a swami. In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear. McMaster had joined Scientology around 1962, having experienced relief of chronic stomach pain after his first auditing session. He became a leading public spokesman for Scientology and later a member of the Sea Org. He left in November 1969, expressing continuing belief in the Scientology Tech, but disapproval of the way Scientology was managed.

The subject stays awake all night, or is woken at 1AM and stays awake all morning, and the next full day. While sleepy, patients find that their depression vanishes, until they sleep again. Combining this with bright light therapy make the beneficial effects last longer than one day. Partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night may be as effective as an all-night sleep deprivation session. Wake therapy is a therapy that falls under chronotherapeutics. Chronotherapy (treatment scheduling) is a process to manipulate biological rhythms and sleep that can help to improve affective disorders quickly. Wake therapy is beneficial for those experiencing major depression along with unipolar, bipolar, and melancholic types of depression. Wake therapy is best used to jump start the effects of the use of an antidepressant. Wake therapy is the use of prolonged times of wakefulness, along with periods of recovering sleep. It is a fast way to improve symptoms of depression. This therapy is best used with other chronotherapeutic techniques. Months of use of this therapy and other therapies can be quite effective to help prevent relapse of depression. Procedure Wake therapy involves one to three rounds which consist of complete sleep avoidance for the night and entire day after, then the cycles are separated with nights of recovery sleep (a full night's sleep). The treatment lasts between two and five days, depending on the number of rounds done. Relapse into depression typically occurs immediately after any amount of sleep. The intervention is done in a hospital or sleep center in order to make sure the program is done properly and full effects are established.Martiny, K. (2010).

They left African Jazz and started their own group, African Fiesta, with which they helped elevate the genre of African rumba into the genre now known as Soukous.

Dr. Nico withdrew from the music scene in the mid-1970s. Tabu Ley and African Fiesta National continued to dominate the Congolese musical scene. By 1970, their records routinely sold in the millions.

On this album, Henry Cow had expanded to include members of Slapp Happy, who had merged with the group after the two had collaborated on Desperate Straights in 1974. The merger ended after recording In Praise of Learning when Peter Blegvad and Anthony Moore from Slapp Happy left the group. Content In Praise of Learning was Henry Cow's most overtly political album. Printed on the back of the album cover is filmmaker John Grierson's quote \\"Art is not a mirror ‚Äì it is a hammer\\", and the Tim Hodgkinson 16-minute composition, \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\" made explicit the band's left wing political leanings, with Dagmar Krause's powerful voice adding a new dimension to their music. The Moore/Blegvad song, \\"War\\" was first recorded as \\"War (Is Energy Enslaved)\\" by Slapp Happy with session musicians in May 1974, but was not released. It was then was re-recorded during the making of the first Slapp Happy/Henry Cow collaborative album, Desperate Straights, but was held back for release on In Praise of Learning. Moore later rearranged the song for his 1979 solo album, Flying Doesn't Help. \\"War\\" was also covered by The Fall on their 1994 album, Middle Class Revolt. \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\" began as an unfinished instrumental that Hodgkinson presented to the group, which was cut up and performed live in 1974 with improvisational sections added. One such performance, Halsteren was recorded in Halsteren in September 1974, and appears in Volume 2: 1974‚Äì5 of The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set (2009). After the merger with Slapp Happy, Hodgkinson commissioned Blegvad to write lyrics for the piece for Krause to sing. But after several attempts, Blegvad admitted that he was \\"out of [his] depth\\", and Hodgkinson wrote the lyrics himself. Chris Cutler's lyrics on \\"Beautiful as the Moon ‚Äì Terrible as an Army with Banners\\" were the first song texts he had written, and the song was the first writing collaboration between Cutler and Fred Frith that later grew into Art Bears. The song also became the longest lasting \\"building block\\" the band used in subsequent live performances. Album and track titles The album's title was taken from \\"In Praise of Learning\\", a poem by Bertolt Brecht, which is one of several \\"In Praise of ...\\" poems he wrote. The title of the track \\"Beautiful as the Moon ‚Äì Terrible as an Army with Banners\\" comes from a line in the Bible's Song of Solomon: \\"Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?\\" Writing in Beyond and Before: Progressive Rock Since the 1960s, Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell posit that the track titles \\"Beginning: The Long March\\" and \\"Morning Star\\" refer to Mao Zedong's Long March and the British communist party newspaper, Morning Star respectively. Cover art The album cover art work was by artist Ray Smith and was the third of three of his \\"paint socks\\" to feature on Henry Cow's albums, the first being on Legend (1973). Smith was not credited on the original LP release of the album. He was not happy with the text on the cover and asked that it be omitted, as was done on Legend cover. But his request was denied. When he asked to be credited under a pseudonym, that was also denied and his name was left off the credits. He was later credited on the CD releases of the album. Hegarty and Halliwel suggest that Smith's red sock is \\"an antidote\\" to the \\"extravagant\\" album cover art work of commercial progressive rock bands. Remixes and reissues The album was remixed in 1985 for a vinyl reissue on the band's own Broadcast label. This remix was used in the 1991 East Side Digital Records CD issue, with one extra track \\"Lovers of Gold\\" (an alternate version of \\"Beginning: The Long March\\" by Chris Cutler). In 2000 Recommended Records and East Side Digital issued a remastered version of In Praise of Learning on CD with the original 1975 mix and without the bonus track. The \\"Lovers of Gold\\" bonus track would later reappear on the Cow Cabinet of Curiosities disc in The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set (2009). Reception A review at AllMusic called In Praise of Learning, the result of Henry Cow and Slapp Happy's brief merger, \\"stunning\\" and \\"bracing\\", and said \\"No one has ever, before or since, sounded like this incarnation of Henry Cow\\". The reviewer described the Moore/Blegvad composition \\"War\\" as \\"enormous [in] proportion and power\\" that would not have succeeded in the hands of the \\"relatively quiet trio\\". Music journalist Robert Christgau described the album's lyrics as \\"literary if not pompous in print\\", but said Krause's \\"abrasively arty, Weill-derived\\" singing \\"manage[s] to find a context for [the] words\\". Christgau complimented Frith's atonal piano, but felt that the musique concr√®te on side two of the LP is \\"less than winning\\". In another review of the album in Let It Rock, Dave Laing said that Krause's vocals have the same \\"brittle style\\" that American singer and songwriter Judy Collins used in \\"Pirate Jenny\\" and the Marat/Sade. He was impressed with Hodgkinson's \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\", its \\"long controlled lyric\\" and its \\"determined fermenting movement to its climax\\". Laing noted, however, that the political themes of the album are damped a little by Blegvad and Moore's \\"War\\", which he felt is \\"musically limp and politically liberal\\", and by the presence of the two \\"experimental\\" instrumentals. But Laing concluded that it is still \\"an unexpectedly fine album, pointing a way forward for both avant- garde and 'committed' music in Britain\\". Reviewing the album in Melody Maker, Steve Lake called In Praise of Learning \\"the album of the year\\". He said it is \\"revolutionary\\" in the sense that it is both \\"innovatory\\" and promoting \\"a revolution in government\\". With quotes from Mao Zedong, \\"no punches [are] pulled ... all the cards are on the table\\", although Lake did feel that Henry Cow tend to be \\"over-scholarly\\" at times. He described the music on the album as \\"nothing less than staggering\\", and called \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\" the LP's \\"tour-de-force\\". Lake said the 15-minute song is \\"threatening and propulsive\\", and culminates in an \\"almost majestic theme\\". Finally, Lake described the instrumental, \\"Beginning: The Long March\\" as \\"the finest use made by any rock band of electronics and free form.\\" Music critic Ian MacDonald wrote in New Musical Express, that In Praise of Learning \\"manages to be simultaneously the group's most extreme and most accessible album so far\\". He called it \\"a demonstrative, theatrical, and didactic record\\" that blends ideology with art. MacDonald described \\"War\\" as \\"downbeat mythologising and exploding musique concrete\\" that \\"heaves and thrashes like an octopus caught in a ship's propellor\\". \\"Beautiful as the Moon ‚Äì Terrible as an Army with Banners\\" starts off well, but is let down later by pretentious lyrics. \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\" also begins well, but despite \\"a remarkable instrumental interlude\\", it \\"sinks awkwardly to earth beneath the would-be climactic exhortations of the finale\\". MacDonald said \\"In Praise of Learning is, like all efforts by compulsive perfectionists, imperfect ‚Äì but aimed high\\". He praised the group for their \\"risk-taking\\" and added that \\"we should be thankful for the ... commitment that leads a group like Henry Cow to pursue so single-mindedly the limits of the feasible in our music\\".

Sides one and two of the LP record consist of composed material while sides three and four contain improvised pieces. The album includes Henry Cow's last John Peel Session, recorded in September 1975 and extracts from a concert with Robert Wyatt at the New London Theatre in May 1975. \\"Groningen\\" (recorded in September 1974) is part of an instrumental suite where the band improvised around fragments of an early version of Tim Hodgkinson's \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\" from In Praise of Learning (1975). Another performance of this suite (in full) later appeared in Halsteren on Volume 2: 1974‚Äì5 of The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set (2009). The album cover art was done by Henry Cow roadie and sound mixer Maggie Thomas. She created it from a collage she made out of a cut-up Henry Cow poster she had designed a few months earlier.

The extra tracks came from Greasy Truckers Live at Dingwalls Dance Hall (1974), a double LP of an October 1973 concert performed by Camel, Henry Cow, Global Village Trucking Company and Gong, each band contributing to one side of the double album. Henry Cow's contribution, however, was actually recorded a week later at The Manor Studios because a power failure at the event had delayed the start of the concert and a 2am curfew reduced Henry Cow's set (billed last) to ten minutes. At the Manor, Henry Cow improvised their Greasy Truckers set to tape and mixed the tracks in a single session. An outtake from this recording session, \\"Bellycan\\" was released on the 1991 CD-release of Legend. In October 2006, Recommended Records released a remastered version of Concerts, which included the Greasy Truckers set, on a double CD. The original dynamics of \\"Oslo\\" were restored, which had been compromised to fit it onto side three of the double LP. The remastering was done by Bob Drake in March 2006.

Thur√∏ is part of the South Funen Archipelago, comprising c. 55 islands altogether. The island had 3,555 inhabitants . Connected to Svendborg proper by a small bridge, Thur√∏ has become a popular place to live due to its quiet streets and proximity to both Svendborg and the new motorway to Odense. Thur√∏ is also a holiday destination, with two popular sandy beaches, three campsites and a number of houses for rent. The sea around horseshoe-shaped Thur√∏ is considered fine fishing-water, particularly for trout. There are several small harbours around the island and Thur√∏bund - the inner part of the horseshoe - is a well-known safe nature-harbour used by the sailing fraternity. The entire island is served by a direct bus link to Svendborg city centre, from where onward routes cover the Funen region.  History  According to legend, and as told in Saxo's Gesta Danorum (chronicles of the Danes), as well as in the Scylding Sagas, Helge (brother to Hroar, both known from the Beowolf poems) once came by this island on one of his raiding expeditions. Here, he came to the house of the elf-woman Thora ( Thur√∏ meaning literally Thora's island -or in some legends Thor's Island), whom he raped. When he returned to the island years later, Thora sent out their daughter, Yrsa, to greet him, as revenge. He raped Yrsa, not knowing it was his own daughter, and she then had his son, Rolf Kraka, who would go on and become one of Denmark's greatest and most legendary kings. Denmarks oldest \\"pacifier-tree\\" has been located on Thur√∏ for 85 years. Part of Danish tradition is for children to \\"sacrifice\\" their pacifiers (dummies) at a local tree to mark their passage from infancy to childhood. The island is no longer an island as the sands have drifted and made a broad passage to the shore. This happened during the 1990s.  Notable people  * Karin Micha√´lis (1872-1950) a Danish journalist and author; from 1933 she took in German emigrants at her property in Thur√∏, including Bertolt Brecht and Marlene Norst; she is buried in Thur√∏ cemetery * Laura Brun-Pedersen (1883‚Äì1961) a Danish painter of deeply coloured landscapes with human figures and animals; she lived on Thur√∏ for 30 years * Tom Kristensen (1893 in London ‚Äì 1974 in Thur√∏) was a Danish poet, novelist, literary critic and journalist * Jan Pytlick (born 1967 in Thur√∏) a Danish handball coach.

It was their last album and was released on Henry Cow's own private label, Broadcast, in 1979. Later editions appeared on Interzone in the US and Celluloid in France. Only the UK Broadcast pressing used the custom label artwork design. Background Western Culture is an instrumental album which came about as a result of disagreements in the band as to what the composition of their next album should be. Recording had already begun at Sunrise Studios in January 1978 and some members were not happy about the predominance of song-oriented material. As a compromise it was agreed that two albums would be made: one of \\"songs\\" (released soon after as Hopes and Fears under the name of a new group Art Bears) and one of purely instrumental compositions. The group returned to Sunrise Studios in July that year to record the instrumental pieces for Western Culture, except \\"¬Ω the Sky\\", which had been recorded during the January sessions. Henry Cow split up shortly after recording this album. Recording The Lindsay Cooper composition \\"¬Ω the Sky\\" was named for Chairman Mao's dictum \\"Women hold up half the sky\\". \\"Viva Pa Ubu\\" (an outtake from the January recording sessions) was written by Tim Hodgkinson as the start of a musical production of Alfred Jarry's play Ubu Roi (Pa Ubu being a character in the play). \\"Viva Pa Ubu\\" includes singing by the whole group, making the CD reissue no longer an instrumental. \\"Viva Pa Ubu\\" and \\"Slice\\" (an outtake from the July‚ÄìAugust recording sessions) had been previously released on the Recommended Records Sampler (1982). During the recording sessions in July and August 1978, Henry Cow also recorded \\"Waking Against Sleep\\", a Fred Frith composition. This 2-minute piece had previously been performed live by the band under the title \\"The Herring People\\", and appeared in Volume 9: Late of The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set (2009). It was later recorded by Curlew under the title \\"Time and a Half\\", and appeared on their album, North America (1985), which was produced by Frith. \\"Waking Against Sleep\\" was never released by Henry Cow, but appeared on the 1990 CD re-issue of Frith's solo album, Gravity. Cover art The album cover art work was done by Chris Cutler. Henry Cow had originally asked cartoonist Don Martin to produce a cover, but he declined. Martin, best known for his work for MAD magazine, had designed several album covers, including The Art Farmer Septet and Sonny Stitt/Bud Powell/J. J. Johnson. Ray Smith, whose painted socks featured on three of Henry Cow's albums, also designed a cover for Western Culture illustrating an industrial city viewed from above with the text \\"Henry Cow\\" appearing in its streets. Smith's cover was not used. CD reissues Western Culture was reissued on CD by Broadcast in 1988 and East Side Digital Records in 1995. It was reissued again on Recommended Records in 2001 and East Side Digital in 2002 with three bonus tracks, \\"Viva Pa Ubu\\", \\"Slice\\" and \\"Look Back (alt)\\", new liner notes and photographs. The bonus tracks are listed in the wrong order in the booklet. \\"Viva Pa Ubu\\", \\"Slice\\" and \\"Look Back (alt)\\" were later reissued on the 2019 Henry Cow Box Redux: The Complete Henry Cow bonus CD, Ex Box ‚Äì Collected Fragments 1971‚Äì1978.

From the 17th century onward, most of the traditional bows in Mongolia were replaced with the similar Manchu bow which is primarily distinguished by larger siyahs and the presence of prominent string bridges. By the 18th century, although the Qing Dynasty maintained archery for military purposes, many Mongol groups had traded their bows for firearms. This print depicts the majority of Western Mongolian Dzungars (right hand side) as being armed with muskets while their Qing foes are primarily armed with the Manchu Bow. Pre- Qing Mongol bow The bows that were used during the rule of Genghis Khan were smaller than the modern Manchu derived weapons used at most Naadam. Paintings as well as at least one surviving example of a 13th-century Mongol bow from Cagaan Chad demonstrate that the medieval Mongolian bows had smaller siyahs and much less prominent leather string bridges. Influence of the Qing dynasty From the 17th‚Äì20th century, horseback archery in Mongolia (and around the world) declined in prominence in proportion to the availability of firearms. Contemporary depictions of the 1768 Battle of Khorgos between the Qing Dynasty and the Western Mongolian Dzungars show the mounted Dzungars primarily armed with muskets. Despite changes in bow construction over time, the Mongolian archery tradition has been continuous. The traditions of Mongolian archery were partially kept alive by the Qing Imperial court which maintained a cohort of Mongolian Imperial Bodyguards specifically trained in archery with Manchurian bows. Gradually, construction of composite bows in Mongolia, China, and Tibet largely shifted to Manchu derived designs to the point where the \\"traditional Mongolian bow\\" used in Naadam festivities is actually derived from the Manchu design.  Construction  Hulagu Khan with the older composite bow used during the time of the Mongol conquest. It is smaller in size and has no string bridges Ancient and modern Mongol bows are part of the Asian composite bow tradition. The core is bamboo, with horn on the belly (facing towards the archer) and sinew on the back, bound together with animal glue.John C Halpin, Halpin C Halpin, Primer on Composite Materials Analysis, CRC Press, Apr 15, 1992, As animal glue is dissolved by water, composite bows may be ruined by rain or excess humidity; a wrapper of (waterproof) birch bark may give limited protection from moisture and from mechanical damage. The bow is usually stored in a leather case for protection when not in use.  The arrows  Birch is a typical material for arrows. The normal length of an arrow is between , and the shaft's diameter is around . As for fletchings, crane tail feathers are favored, but tail feathers of all birds are usable. Eagle feathers make a particularly prized arrow, but eagle feathers are relatively difficult to acquire. Feathers taken from wings are said to flow less smoothly through the air, so if given the choice, tail feathers are picked. The Mongols characteristically pay close attention to the minutest details; the placement of the fletchings in relation to their size, and what part of the bird the feathers originate from, are of great importance for correct rotation and good balance in the air. Consequently, these factors are painstakingly considered when making arrows after the Old Mongol standard. Arrowheads can be everything from wide metal blades used for big game (or in war) to bone and wooden points, which are used for hunting birds and small animals. The high impact force of this bow ensures that a bony point will be lethal when hitting the body of a smaller animal. In addition to these kinds of arrows, whistling arrows are useful during hunting, because the effect on animals of an arrow whistling away high above the ground is often to make it stop, curious to see what is in the air. This gives the hunter time to launch a second arrow with lethal intent. These whistling arrows are made by inserting an arrowhead of bone in which hollow channels have been created. When shot, such arrowheads make a very audible sound through the air. Timurid depiction of a Mongol archer. (Signed (lower right): Muhammad ibn Mahmudshah al-Khayyam, early 15th century).  Range  Mongol cavalrymen during the time of the Mongol conquest used a smaller bow suitable for horse archery. An inscription thought to be from 1226 was found on a stone stele in Nerchinsk, Siberia. It may have said: \\"While Chinggis Khan was holding an assembly of Mongolian dignitaries, after his conquest of Sartaul (East Turkestan), [Chinggis's nephew] Esungge shot a target at 335 alds ().\\"WHAT IS THE SCRIPT ON THE CHINGGIS KHAN'S STELE ABOUT?, Gongor LHAGVASUREN In the historical novel \\"Kh√∂kh Sudar\\" Injinashi, the Mongolian philosopher, historian and writer, imagines the competition amongst all Mongolian men in about 1194‚Äì1195: five archers each hit the target three times from a distance of 500 bows (1 bow = at least ). Mongolian draw and release draw The Mongolian draw, or thumb draw, uses only the thumb, the strongest single digit, to grasp the string. Around the back of the thumb, the index and/or middle fingers reinforce the grip. This is traditional across the Asian steppes, as well as in Korea, Japan, Tibet, China, Turkey, India and recent Persia.Archery Traditions of Asia. Stephen Selby. Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence, 2003. It was also used by Ishi, the last of the Yana, with his short bows. It gives a narrower grip on the string, as only one digit is used, and this may help to avoid \\"string pinch\\" with shorter bows, such as the composite bows normally used from horseback. Mongol archers would wear a thumb ring made from leather, bone, horn, and in some cases silver to protect the thumb. It may also avoid a problem occasionally faced by archers using the Mediterranean release, when the three fingers do not release at exactly the same time and thus foul the draw. This release is normally used with the arrow on the right side of the bow for a right-handed archer who holds the bow in the left hand and draws with the right; a left-handed archer will usually reverse this arrangement.

Abstract: Although the Mongols used many of the tactics and strategies that steppe nomads had used for centuries, the Mongols refined steppe warfare so that this style of warfare reached its apogee during the Mongol Empire. Furthermore, the Mongols developed a style of warfare that made them possibly the greatest military force in history. This work examines several facets of the pre-dissolution period (1200-1260). With the dissolution of the Mongol Empire, Mongol warfare once again changed. In some areas it remained complex while in others it regressed to traditional forces of steppe warfare, still potent but not as effective as the pre-dissolution period. * OtgonbaiÔ∏†aÔ∏°r, KhuÃárƒón-Alagiƒ≠n, and T»Øm»ØrkhuÃáuÃágiƒ≠n Batm»Ønkh.

Exarc.net. Abstract: This bow was a concept, commissioned from Ulrich Velthuysen, a Swedish archer. This horn bow could be classified as a post-conquest design from early 14th century AD Mongolia. In this article, I will describe, step- by-step, the gathering and processing of materials, and the construction of this design of horn bow. Unfortunately, there are only a few pictorial representations of what bows may have looked like during 14th century AD Mongolia; although, there are many other variations of bows during this time period with similar characteristics. Bow styles varied from bowyer to bowyer, so while bowyers duplicated basic fundamentals of construction, there were many different methods of construction, and individual styles of bow-shaping. This article also aims to provide a historical background to a modern 2016 reproduction of a composite horn bow dating from the period of the Mongol expansion. The overview of the bow design includes all types of available and valid sources that speak in favour of its construction and other historical solutions these construction decisions were based upon.

He has had several gold records in his career. He is the founder of the Quartier Latin International orchestra with many notable artists, including Fally Ipupa and Ferr√© Gola. Background Olomide, was born on 13 July 1956 in Kisangani, DRC. His mother named him Koffi because he was born on a Friday. He grew up in a middle-class family, without any musical background. During his youth, Olomide improvised by singing popular songs with his own lyrics and altered rhythms until a neighbor taught him how to play the guitar. Education Often described by fellow students and his teachers alike as \\"a very bright student,\\" Olomide got a scholarship to study in Bordeaux, France where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in business economics. He is also reported to hold a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Paris. Musical career Upon his return to the Congo in the 1970s, Koffi joined Papa Wemba's band, Viva la Musica, initially as a composer and songwriter, and later as a lead vocalist. In 1986, he formed his band known as Quartier Latin International, which celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006. Since then, he has performed and recorded both with the group and by himself. Over the years, he built up a faithful fan base internationally, particularly in Africa and Europe. Koffi popularized the slower style of Soukous, which he dubbed Tcha Tcho. His music can be quite controversial, taking on current events and topics considered taboo in some conservative societies. He also participated in the salsa music project Africando. For his effort, Effrakata, released in 2001, Koffi received four awards on a single night at the annual Kora Awards in South Africa for 2002 and 2003, including the award for Best African Artist, which he won in 1998. More recently, he won the Kora Award for \\"Best African Artist of The Decade\\". This established one of his many aliases, the 'Quadra Kora Man.' His music Olomide's album Haut de Gamme: Kowe√Øt, Rive Gauche is listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In March 2003 Olomide released \\"Affaire D'Etat\\", a double CD album featuring 18 tracks. Olomide was part of the Papa Wemba musical, in the early 1980s. He has trained many young musicians, some of whom have since left his Quartier Latin band and gone solo. Some of those who have left are Fele Mudogo, Sam Tshintu, Suzuki 4x4, Soleil Wanga, Bouro Mpela, Fally Ipupa, Montana Kamenga, Ferre Gola. However Suzuki 4x4 has recently showed up once more in some of Quartier Latin shows, along with new recruits like Cindy Le Coeur, a female singer with very high pitched vocals, recorded here, in the song L'Amour N'existe Pas (Love doesn't exist). Koffi ‚Äì who mostly refers to himself as \\"Mopao\\" ‚Äì has a new release known as La Chicotte a Papa, having recently excelled in hits like Lovemycine, Diabolos, Grand Pretre Mere and Soupou, Cle Boa, among others. Koffi's talent could be compared to the once king of African rhumba, Franco Luambo Makiadi, who also saw many artists pass through his expert hands during his days. Today, Olomde is one of Africa's most popular musicians. Assaults Olomide has a history of assaulting people. In 2008 he was accused of kicking a cameraman at a concert in Kinshasa; the matter was resolved out of court. In 2012 he was convicted of assaulting his producer, and received a three-month suspended sentence. In July 2016 while on a concert trip to Kenyahttps://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/25/africa/koffi-olomide-dancer- kenya/index.html, Olomide was filmed kicking one of his female dancers at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The video went viral, his planned concert at The Bomas of Kenya was cancelled, and he was deported. Five days later he was arrested at his home in Kinshasa, and the same day sentenced to 18 months in prison, which, after the intervention of the Congolese head of state, was commuted to three months. In March 2019, he was given a two-year suspended prison sentence by a French court, for the statutory rape of one of his former dancers when she was 15 years old. He was also ordered to pay ‚Ç¨5,000 in damages to the dancer. Three other women, all former dancers in Olomide's band alleged that he had sexually assaulted them several times between 2002 and 2006, and held them against their will in a villa outside Paris. The court dismissed those charges but fined Olomide another ‚Ç¨5,000, for assisting the three women to enter France illegally.

(also Kouber or Kuver) was a Bulgar leader who according to the Miracles of Saint Demetrius liberated a mixed Bulgar and Byzantine Christian population in the 670s, whose ancestors had been transferred from the Eastern Roman Empire to the Syrmia region in Pannonia by the Avars 60 years earlier.CurtaFine According to a scholarly theory, he was a son of Kubrat, brother of Khan Asparukh and member of the Dulo clan.  Origins  According to the Byzantine scholar, Theophanes the Confessor, Kubrat's (unnamed) fourth son, who left the Pontic steppes after his father's death around 642, became \\"the subject of the of the Avars in Avar Pannonia and remained there with his army\\",The Chronicle of Theophanes Confessor (357.13.), p. 498. According to a scholarly theory, first proposed by the Bulgarian historian Vasil Zlatarski, Kuber was the fourth son of Kubrat, the Christian ruler of the Onogur Bulgars in the steppes north of the Black Sea. Kuber's story is continued in the second book of the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. The book is a hagiographic work, written in Thessaloniki in the 680s or 690s. Denis Sinor wrote \\"The Avar Kaghan entrusted Kuber and his suite with the governing of the descendants of the Christian Byzantine prisoners of war, carried off sixty years ago, who were living mixed with Avars and Bulghars north of the Danube, not far from the former province of Pannonia Sirmiensis.\\"The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, Volume 1 p.215 Nevertheless, Kuber's people soon liberated the POWs and led them south to the region of modern North Macedonia. The American historian John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. writes that, if Zlatarski's theory is correct, Kuber was named for his father, because Kuber and Kubrat are most probably two Greek versions of the same Bulgar name. However, others suggest Kuber is but a reference to Asparukh's own Kubiar branch of Kubrat's Dulo clan where \\"Kubi-ar\\" may mean \\"fair haired\\".\\"Bulgarien 1300\\" Page 55 Peter M. Hill 1982  In Avar Pannonia  Syrmia, the region governed by Kuber in the Avar Khaganate Kuber was the ruler of a mixed population in the former Roman province of Pannonia Secunda, including the descendants of the prisoners of war whom the Avars had captured in the Balkan Peninsula and settled around Sirmium. He was made governor by the khagan. Historian Samuel Sz√°deczky-Kardosswho accepts Kuber's identification as Kubrat's son and thus a scion of the royal Dulo clanwrites that Kuber became governor of that region, because the Khagan wanted to separate him from his Bulgar subjects who had followed him from the Pontic steppes. Kuber's subjects called themselves Sermesianoi, but the Byzantines regarded them \\"Bulgars\\". They preserved their Christian traditions, although their ancestors had been taken to the Avar Khaganate about 60 years before Kuber's appointment. The Sermesianoi did not cease to dream of their return to their ancestors' homes. Taking advantage of his subjects' feelings, Kuber rose up in open rebellion against the Khagan \\"in our times\\", according to the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. Modern historians say that Kuber's rebellion occurred in the 670s or early 680s. Around 70,000 Sermesianoi joined him and departed for the Byzantine Empire. The khagan attempted to hinder their migration, but they routed the Avars in five or six battles and crossed the river Danube.  In Macedonia  Bulgaria of Kuber Seal of Mauros, one of Kuber's chief associates, from 684‚Äì685 AD. The inscription says: \\"Of Mauros, patrikios and archon of the Sermesianoi and Bulgaroi\\". Kuber and his people moved as far as the region of Thessaloniki. He decided to settle together with the Sermesianoi in a plain and sent his envoy to the Byzantine Emperor, whom the Miracles of Saint Demetrios did not name, to request his permission. The emperor gave his consent and ordered the nearby Slavic tribe of the Dragovites to supply Kuber and his people with food. However, Kuber's people still wanted to go back to their ancestral homes and started to disperse. Fearing of the decline of his power base, Kuber asked the emperor to forbid the Sermesianoi to leave the plain and to confirm Kuber's position as their ruler. His request seems to have been rejected, because he attempted to seize Thessaloniki, taking advantage of a civil war in the city. However, Saint Demetrius unmasked Kuber's agents who tried to open the gates of Thessaloniki, hindering him from entering the city, according to the saint's hagiography. There is no more information of Kuber's life. Some modern historiansincluding Zlatarski and Cankova-Petkovasay that he established a Bulgar state in Macedonia which existed in parallel with Khan Asparukh's Bulgarian Empire. They also write that the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II who had subjugated the Slavic tribes around Thessaloniki was ambushed and defeated by the Bulgars from Kuber's state on his return to Constantinople in 689. Asparukh's son, Tervel, cooperated with his \\"uncles in the region of Thessaloniki\\" against the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II, according to the inscription on the Madara Rider.–í–µ—Å–µ–ª–∏–Ω –ë–µ—à–µ–≤–ª–∏–µ–≤, \\"–ü—ä—Ä–≤–æ–±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞–¥–ø–∏—Å–∏\\", –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—É–∫–∏—Ç–µ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1979, —Å—Ç—Ä. 94 / \\"Protobulgarian inscriptions\\", Publishing house of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, 1979, p. 94[...] of Bulgars [...] and came to Tervel.

Nicknamed \\"Divine Physician\\", he ranks 56th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 20th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background An Daoquan, who bases his medical practice in Jiankang Prefecture (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), is nicknamed \\"Divine Phyisican\\" as he could cure many rare and critical illnesses. He is often compared to the legendary Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo. Joining Liangshan When Song Jiang is heading a military attack against Daming Prefecture (Â§ßÂêçÂ∫ú; present-day Daming County, Hebei) to rescue Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu, he suddenly falls very ill with a tumour on his back. A fever comes on and never subsides, causing him to finally fall into delirium. Back in Liangshan with his troops, Song continues to be bedridden, with his condition deteriorating and all medicines to no avail. Zhang Shun, who grew up in the Yangtze region, remembers that once his mother had a similar illness and was healed by An Daoquan. He volunteers to fetch An from Jiankang. Zhang Shun comes to the Yangtze and boards the boat of the pirate Zhang Wang. Midway across the river, Zhang Wang pounces on him when he is asleep, ties him up and throws him into the river. An expert swimmer, Zhang Shun frees himself underwater and gets to the opposite bank, where he finds the inn of Wang Dingliu. Wang's father rents him a room and introduces his son to him. Zhang Shun finds An Daoquan, who agrees to go to Liangshan only after his persistent plea. That night An takes Zhang along when he visits a prostitute whom he is besotted with called Li Qiaonu . Zhang is worried that An is not willing to part from Li, who keeps plying the physician with drinks until he is drunk as a fiddler. Then he discovers that Zhang Wang, apparently also a patron of Li, also calls on the woman. After the two disappeared into a room, Zhang Shun kills the mamasan and two servants of the brothel. Then he knocks on the door of Li's room and hacks her to death when she opens it. Zhang Wang, hearing the cry, gets away. Remembering what Wu Song did in Mengzhou, Zhang Shun writes with the blood of Li on the wall a supposed confession by An himself that he is the killer. When An wakes up, he has no choice but to go with Zhang Shun to Liangshan. At Wang Dingliu's inn, Zhang Shun relates what has happened. Wang notices Zhang Wang is at the bank and asks him to ferry his two \\"relatives\\". When the boat is midstream, Zhang Shun, who has exchanged clothes with An Daoquan to deceive Zhang Wang, overcomes the boatman with the help of Wang. They tie him up and dump him into the river. Zhang Shun asks Wang to join Liangshan and the young man gladly agrees. At Liangshan, An cures Song Jiang of his life-threatening illness.  Campaigns  An Daoquan is appointed as Liangshan's physician after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Just before the battle of Hangzhou in the campaign against Fang La, Emperor Huizong summons An Daoquan to the imperial capital Dongjing (Êù±‰∫¨; present-day Kaifeng, Henan) because he is down with a minor illness. After healing the emperor, An is retained in the palace where he serves as an imperial physician.

Life Bowen was born in 1885 on Hayling Island in Hampshire. She had a difficult childhood; her alcoholic father Vere Douglas Campbell left the family at an early age and was eventually found dead on a London street. She and her sister grew up in poverty with a less than affectionate mother.\\"Long, Mrs. Gabrielle Margaret Vere (Campbell)\\", in Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft, Twentieth Century Authors, A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature, (Third Edition). New York, The H.W. Wilson Company, 1950, (pp. 845‚Äì6) Bowen studied at the Slade School of Fine Art and later in Paris. Her first fiction was a violent historical novel, The Viper of Milan (written when she was 16), set in medieval Italy. The Viper of Milan was rejected by several publishers, who considered it inappropriate for a young woman to have written such a novel. It went on to become a best-seller when eventually published. After this, Bowen's prolific writings were the chief financial support for her family. She was married twice: first, from 1912 to 1916, to a Sicilian, Zefferino Emilio Constanza, who died of tuberculosis, and then to Arthur L. Long. Bowen had four children; a son and a daughter (who died in infancy) with Costanza, and two sons with Long. In 1938, Bowen was one of the signatories to a petition organised by the National Peace Council, calling for an international peace conference in an effort to avert war in Europe.National Petition for A New Peace Conference,(23 November 1938) National Peace Council. (p. 8). In an interview for Twentieth Century Authors, she listed her hobbies as \\"painting, needlework and reading\\". Her cousin was the artist Nora Molly Campbell 1888-1971. Bowen died on 23 December 1952 at the St Charles Hospital in Kensington, London after suffering serious concussion as a result of a fall in her bedroom.Cambridge University Press Work Her total output numbers over 150 volumes with the bulk of her work under the 'Bowen' pseudonym. She also wrote under the names Joseph Shearing, George R. Preedy, John Winch, Robert Paye and Margaret Campbell. After The Viper of Milan (1906), she produced a steady stream of writings until the day of her death.Bowen's work under her own name was primarily historical novels. Bowen crafted a trilogy of historical novels about King William III. The novels are I Will Maintain (1910), Defender of the Faith (1911), and God and the King (1911) .F.

Detroit; Gale Research, 1995. (p.45). Bowen also wrote non-fiction history books aimed at a popular readership. Under the pseudonym \\"Joseph Shearing\\", Bowen wrote several mystery novels inspired by true-life crimes. For instance, For Her to See (1947, AKA So Evil My Love) is a fictionalised version of the Charles Bravo murder.Jane W. Stedman, \\"Shearing, Joseph\\" in Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers, edited by James Vinson and D.L. Kirkpatrick. St. James Press, 1985. (pp. 797‚Äì801). The Shearing novels were especially popular in the United States, Moss Rose, The Golden Violet and Forget-Me-Not achieving both critical and commercial success, being championed by reviewers such as Phil Stong.\\"Shearing, Joseph\\", in Stanley J.

Wilson Company, 1950, (pp. 845‚Äì6) Until the late 1940s, the true identity of Shearing was not known to the general public, and some speculated it was the pseudonym of F. Tennyson Jesse. Under the \\"George R. Preedy\\" pseudonym, she wrote two non-supernatural horror novels, Dr. Chaos and The Devil Snar'd.Neil Wilson, Shadows in the Attic : A Guide to British Supernatural Fiction, 1820‚Äì1950. Boston Spa, British Library, 2000. (p. 97). Her last, posthumous, novel was The Man with the Scales (1954); it is about a man obsessed with revenge, and contains supernatural elements reminiscent of E. T. A. Hoffmann.Edward Wagenknecht. Seven Masters of Supernatural Fiction. New York: Greenwood Press, 1991 (p. 165, 180). Many of these stories were published as Berkley Medallion Books. Several of her books were adapted as films. Bowen's supernatural short fiction was gathered in three collections: The Last Bouquet (1933), The Bishop of Hell, (1949) (featuring an introduction by Michael Sadleir) and the posthumous Kecksies, edited for Arkham House in the late 1940s, but not actually published until 1976.Don D'Ammassa Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction Infobase Publishing, 2009. , (p. 188-89). Critical reception Bowen's books are much sought after by aficionados of gothic horror and received praise from critics. Graham Greene stated in his Paris Review interview (Autumn 1953), \\"I chose Marjorie Bowen [as a major influence] because as I have told you, I don't think that the books that one reads as an adult influence one as a writer...But books such as Marjorie Bowen's, read at a young age, do influence one considerably.\\"The Art of Fiction:Graham Greene Horror reviewer Robert Hadji described Bowen as \\"one of the great supernatural writers of this century\\". Fritz Leiber referred to \\"Marjorie Bowen's brilliant Black Magic\\".Fritz Leiber, \\"Wonder and Terror\\" in Kirby McCauley, Frights St. Martin's Press, 1976. (p.5) Jessica Amanda Salmonson, discussing The Last Bouquet, described Bowen's prose as \\"stylish and moody, dramatic to the highest degree\\" and stated \\"what in other hands is merely tacky or gross is, from Marjorie Bowen, a superior art, chilling and seductive\\".Jessica Amanda Salmonson, \\"The Last Bouquet\\", in Stephen Jones, Kim Newman (ed.), Horror: 100 Best Books. London. Xanadu, 1988. (pp. 120‚Äì122). Sally Benson in The New Yorker, discussing the \\"Joseph Shearing\\" books: \\"Mr Shearing is a painstaking researcher, a superb writer, a careful technician, and a master of horror. There is no one else quite like him\\". Reviewing The Crime of Laura Sarelle Will Cuppy stated \\"Those who want a good workout of the more perilous emotions will do well to read Mr. Shearing's impressive tale of love, death and doom... Join the Shearing cult and meet one of the most malevolent females in song or story\\". In an article about women writers, the Australian newspaper The Courier-Mail described Bowen as \\"one of the best of our modern novelists\\".The Courier-Mail, 6 February 1988.Sheldon Jaffery stated that Bowen's \\"weird fiction ranks favorably with such distaff portrayers of the supernatural as Mary Wilkins-Freeman, Edith Wharton and Lady Cynthia Asquith.\\" Sheldon Jaffery, The Arkham House Companion, San Bernardino, Calif. : Borgo Press, 1990. (p. 117) By contrast, Colin Wilson's view of Bowen's work was negative: in a review of A Sort of Life by Grahame Greene, Wilson dismissed Bowen as a writer of \\"bad adventure stories\\".Colin Wilson, \\"Colin Wilson on Grahame Greene's Autobiography\\", The Spectator, 18 September 1973.

Youth and early political activities Mile Budak was born in Sveti Rok, in Lika, which was then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Profile , jasenovac-info.com; accessed 8 August 2014. He attended school in Sarajevo and studied law at the University of Zagreb.Contemporary Croatian literature by Ante Kadiƒá, published by Mouton, 1960 (page 50) In 1912, he was arrested by Austro-Hungarian authorities over his alleged role in the attempted assassination of Slavko Cuvaj, Croatian ban (viceroy). Usta≈°e period Budak after the assassination attempt, 1932 Nazi collaborator Haj Amin al-Husseini and Mile Budak meeting in occupied Sarajevo, 1943. Budak and Vladko Maƒçek served as lawyers representing Marko Hraniloviƒá and Matija Soldin at trial amid the January 6th Dictatorship. On 7 June 1932, he survived an assassination attempt by operatives close to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Afterwards, he migrated to Italy to join the Usta≈°e and become the commander of an Usta≈°e training camp. In 1938, he returned to Zagreb where he began publishing the weekly newspaper Hrvatski narod. The newspaper was vocal in its criticism of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and opposed the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement, by which the autonomous Banovina of Croatia was created. In 1940, the authorities of the Banovina of Croatia banned the newspaper and had Budak arrested, along with 50 other Usta≈°e members. They were first interned in a prison in Lepoglava, and were later transferred to Kru≈°ƒçica near Travnik. On 31 March 1941, in a joint letter to Hitler, Paveliƒá and Budak asked him \\"to help Croatian people establish an independent Croatian state that would encompass the old Croatian regions, among them Bosnia and Herzegovina\\".Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Second World War by Enver Red≈æiƒá, Routledge, 2005; , , page 68 When the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, Budak became the state's chief propagandistYugoslavia as History: Twice There was a Country by John R.

Budak signed the Ustashe regime's racial laws against Serbs, Jews, and Roma.To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia by Michael Parenti, Verso, 2002 p. 45 The full text of the racist law was published in Narodne novine from 4 June 1941. with and titled as \\"Zakonske odredbe o za≈°titi narodne i arijske kulture hrvatskog naroda\\" Croatian novelist Miroslav Krle≈æa described Budak as \\"a minister of culture with a machine gun\\". According to an alleged statement, reportedly said by Budak, the Usta≈°e plan was to \\"kill one part of the Serbs, evacuate another and lead over one part to Catholicism and thus transform them into Croats.\\" The origins of this statement are unclear. According to Veljko Bulajiƒá, the statement originates from a speech in Gospiƒá on 22 July 1941. Other authors claim that it came in a radio broadcast, while some attribute it to Dido Kvaternik. In a report to the Yugoslav government-in-exile, the statement was attributed to Andrija Artukoviƒá. There are various versions of the quote that differ in wording. The historian Tomislav Duliƒá said that he \\"tried to find a primary source that could confirm the existence and exact wording of this statement\\", but was \\"not been able to ascertain whether such a statement actually exists\\". He later became Croatian envoy to Nazi Germany (November 1941 ‚Äì April 1943) and foreign minister (May 1943 ‚Äì November 1943).The war we lost: Yugoslavia's Tragedy and the Failure of the West by Constantin Fotitch, published by Viking Press, 1948 (page 122)War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo Tomasevich, published by Stanford University Press, 2001 , (page 317) When the Independent State of Croatia collapsed, Budak was captured by British military authorities and handed over to Tito's Partisans on 18 May 1945. He was court- martialled (before the military court of the 2nd Yugoslav army) in Zagreb on 6 June 1945 and was sentenced to death by hanging the same day. His execution the following day took place exactly 13 years after the assassination attempt on his life.Politiƒçka i ekonomska osnova narodne vlasti u Jugoslaviji za vreme obnove by Branko Petranoviƒá, published by Institut za savremenu istoriju, Beograd 1969 (page 201) During the trial, Budak behaved cowardly, constantly weeping, and claiming he was not guilty of anything.Hrvatska 1945 by Bogdan Radica, published by Knji≈ænica Hrvatske revije, 1974 (page 185) Svojim ravnodu≈°nim, da ne ka≈æem ciniƒçkim glasom, ka≈æe mi da se na procesu najsramotnije i najkukaviƒçkije dr≈æao Mile Budak.

About Budak's writing, E.E. Noth wrote: \\"Here we find the stubborn, spiritual-realistic conception of man and his relation to the soil on which he lives and which Mile Budak symbolizes as 'the hearth'\\".Books Abroad: A Quarterly Publication Devoted to Comments on Foreign Books by Roy Temple House, Ernst Erich Noth, University of Oklahoma, 1940 (p. 329) After the war his books were banned by Yugoslav Communist authorities. Thus, many Croatian nationalists viewed Budak as a great figure of Croatian literature, equal, if not superior to the leftist Miroslav Krle≈æa. Following Croatian independence in the early 1990s, the Croatian Democratic Union badly wanted to reinterpret the fascist Ustasha quislings of World War II as a Croatian patriotic force. Hence, the reissue in early 1993 of the collected works of Mile Budak,the second-in-command in the Ustasha regime. Commenting, at the time of this reissue, Croatian writer Giancarlo Kravar wrote: \\"...

As the second son of Fran√ßois Cressent, sculpteur du roi, and grandson of Charles Cressent, a furniture-maker of Amiens, who also became a sculptor, he inherited the tastes and aptitudes which were likely to make a finished designer and craftsman. Even more important perhaps was the fact that he was a pupil of Andr√© Charles Boulle. Trained in such surroundings, it is not surprising that he should have reached a degree of achievement which has to a great extent justified the claim that he was the best decorative artist of the 18th century. Cressent's distinction is closely connected with the regency, but his earlier work had affinities with the school of Boulle, while his later pieces were full of originality. As Geoffrey Bellaigue suggests, \\"Cressent was in his opinion and in that of his contemporaries more than just a skilled cabinet maker and sculptor...he was a collector of refined taste and a talented designer\\". Cressent was likewise a sculptor, and among his plastic work is known to have been a bronze bust of Louis d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Chartres, the son of Philippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Orl√©ans (later Regent of France for Louis XV), for whom Cressent had made one of the finest examples of French furniture of the 18th century the famous medaillier now in the Biblioth√®que Nationale. Cressent's bronze mounts were executed with a sharpness of finish and a grace and vigour of outline which were hardly excelled by his great contemporary Jacques Caffieri. His female figures placed at the corners of tables are indeed among the most delicious achievements of the great days of the French metal worker. The work of identification is rendered comparatively easy in his case by the fact that he published catalogues of three sales of his work. These catalogues are highly characteristic of the man, who shared in no small degree the personal bravura of Cellini, and could sometimes execute almost as well. He did not hesitate to describe himself as the author of a clock worthy to be placed in the very finest cabinets, the most distinguished bronzes, or pieces of the most elegant form adorned with bronzes of extra richness. He worked much in marqueterie, both in tortoiseshell and in brilliant colored woods. He was indeed an artist to whom colour appealed with especial force.

As of 2020, the band consists of vocalist Bo Summer, guitarists Jakob Batten and Rasmus Henriksen, bassist Kussen and drummer Rasmus Schmidt. Since the beginning of the 1990s, Illdisposed have been one of the top bands of the Nordic death metal scene and have released 13 albums and two EPs. Illdisposed have developed their own form of death metal with groovy rhythms, melodic but still hard hitting riffs and a massive wall of sound with a unique subwoofer vocal in focus. History = Four Depressive Seasons, Submit and There's Something Rotten‚Ä¶ (1992‚Äì1997) = In early 1991, Illdisposed was formed and soon released their first demo entitled The Winter of Our Discontempt, this demo brought the band a deal with Nuclear Blast Records. In the end of 1992, the band contributed with the track \\"Reversed\\" to the compilation Fuck You, We're from Denmark, released by Progress Red Labels, followed by 1993's debut album Four Depressive Seasons, and in December 1993 toured in Europe as support for Wargasm and Sinister. In 1994 guitarist Hans Wagnerwas fired, due to problems with alcoholism, is temporarily replaced by Morten Gilsted. In 1994 The first EP \\"Return from tomorrow\\" was released. In early 1995, drummer Lars Hald assumed for some live concerts, the second studio album Submit was released with new drummer Rolf Rognvard-Hansen, previously had been guitarist for Caustic from Esbjerg. During the tour in Germany to promote the album, guitarist Lasse Bak played several concerts naked. There's Something Rotten... In the State of Denmark is the third studio album, and was released in 1997. This album marked the departure of guitarist Morten Gilsted replaced by ex-roadie Tore Mogensen. While recording the album, the band was featured in the documentary \\"Headbang i Hovedlandet\\" alongside future member Jakob 'Batten' Hansen's band Infernal Torment in 1997. = Retro and Kokaiinum (1998‚Äì2002) = In 2000, Illdisposed released the tribute album Retro, with covers of bands such as Carcass, Autopsy, Darkthrone, Venom, Mot√∂rhead, and AC/DC. It was the first album to feature guitarist Jakob \\"Batten\\" Hansen, who joined the band in 1999, after Lasse Bak's brother Ronnie Bak had left. This was followed by their fourth album Kokaiinum in 2001, which featured original songs only. The song \\"Fear Bill Gates\\" was only one example for the band's lively sense of humor. Kokaiinum sometimes fused more melodic elements in the music, but still retained the groove/death metal style, that the band was known for. = From 1-800 Vindication to To Those Who Walk Behind Us (2003-2009) = The band went on short hiatus because Bo needed time to cure his alcoholism. In 2003, they went back together, to release the \\"Demo 2003\\" EP, which already included some songs from the upcoming album 1-800 Vindication, those were \\"Jeff\\" and \\"Dark\\". The band had found new members in Thomas \\"Muskelbux\\" Jensen on drums and Jonas \\"Kloge\\" Mikkelsen on bass. Tore Mogensen left the band during that time and started working at TC Electronics, while Jakob \\"Batten\\" Hansen switched from bass to lead guitar. In 2004, 1-800 Vindication was released. It was the band's most successful album, released on Roadrunner Records. The song \\"Still Sane\\" was released as a single and a video was shot for it by Lasse Hoile, who also designed the artwork for the album. The release was followed by a tour and a DVD, shot in Arhus, entitled \\"We suck - live in Arhus\\". This DVD was during that time only available as a bootleg, but went on to be sold regularly, due to its high quality. In 2005, guitarist and founding member Lasse Bak left the band to join his former Illdisposed band comrades Rolf Hansen and Morten Gilsted in Slow Death Factory. A short-lived replacement was found in ex-roadie and Exmortem guitarist Martin Thim, who joined during the recording of the band's sixth studio album Burn Me Wicked, released in 2006 on Roadrunner Records. The music on Burn Me Wicked was written almost entirely by Jakob Hansen, who recorded demos of the songs on his computer at home and then passed it to the other members. The two Roadrunner albums are the most successful Illdisposed albums to date, with sales of 30,000 copies each (before the re-release on Massacre). After an extensive tour, the band went back in the studio again, to record their seventh album The Prestige. The Prestige took the band more back to their roots and sounded more straightforward and rawer than its predecessors. Before recording started, Martin Thim left the band to focus more on his day job; he was replaced by ex- Volbeat guitarist Franz \\"Hellboss\\" Gottschalk. One of their most successful gigs was the With Full Force festival in Germany, where the band presented The Prestige in front of over 70,000 people. A live video of the song \\"A Child Is Missing\\" can be found on the band's website. Only one year later, the band hit the studio again with a new record deal on Massacre Records, after Roadrunner dissolved the contract to the band. In 2009, Massacre Records released the new album To Those Who Walk Behind Us as well as re-releasing Illdisposed's Roadrunner albums 1-800 Vindication and Burn Me Wicked. This album was produced by Illdisposed's guitarist Jakob \\"Batten\\" Hansen and mixed by longtime friend Tue Madsen. To Those Who Walk Behind Us represented a mix between the band's more traditional death-metal sound and their use of synthesizers on albums like 1-800 Vindication and Burn Me Wicked. On June 23, 2012, The original Illdisposed Line Up consisting of Bo Summer, Lasse Bak, Ronnie Bak, Morten Gilsted and Rolf Hansen, played a reunion show at Lasse Bak's 40th Birthday.

A Carian by birth, he was the son of Camissares by a Paphlagonian mother. His father being satrap of Cilicia under Artaxerxes II, and high in the favour of that monarch, Datames became one of the king's bodyguards; and having in this capacity distinguished himself in the war against the Cadusii, was appointed to succeed his father (who had fallen in that war) in the government of his province. Here he distinguished himself both by his military abilities and his zeal in the service of the king; and reduced to subjection two officials who had revolted from Artaxerxes, Thyus, governor of Paphlagonia, and Aspis of Cataonia.  Etymology  \\"Datames\\" is the Hellenized form of the Old Iranian *DƒÅtama- or *DƒÅtƒÅma-, either from DƒÅtamiŒ∏ra (\\"Gift of Mithra\\") or *Data-ama (\\"to whom force is given\\").; The name is attested in Aramaic as Tadanmu.  Background  Datames was born in .; He was a son of Camisares, an Iranian satrap who governed Cilicia under the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II ().; Camisares was most likely from a Persian noble-family that settled in Caria, and was one of the nobles who sided with Artaxerxes II during the revolt of Cyrus the Younger.; Datames' mother was a Paphlagonian princess named Scythissa, who was married to Camisares sometime before 401 BC. Revolt against Artaxerxes II He was in consequence entrusted by the Persian king with the chief command of a force designed for the recovery of Egypt, following the failure of Pharnabazus II; but the machinations of his enemies at the Persian court, and the risks to which he was in consequence exposed, induced him to change his plan, and throw off his allegiance to the king (c.370 BC). He withdrew with the troops under his command into Cappadocia, and made common cause with the other satraps who had revolted from Persia (the \\"Satraps' Revolt\\"). Achaemenid Cappadocia. Artabazos, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, one of the generals that remained faithful to the king, advanced against him from Pisidia, but was entirely defeated. The great reputation that Datames had acquired induced Artaxerxes to direct his utmost exertions to effect his subjection, but Autophradates, who was sent against him with a large army, was obliged to retreat with heavy loss. Datames, however, though constantly victorious against open foes, ultimately fell a victim to treachery, and, after evading numerous plots that had been formed against his life, was assassinated at a conference by Mithridates, the son of Ariobarzanes, who had gained his confidence by assuming the appearance of hostility to the king.Nepos, Datames, x; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca, xv. 91; Polyaenus, Stratagemata, vii. 21, vii. 29 Evaluation Datames appears to have obtained the highest reputation in his day for courage and ability in war, which caused his fame to extend even among the Greeks, though he did not come into personal collision with them. Cornelius Nepos (to whose biographical sketch we owe the only connected narrative of his life) calls him the bravest and most able of all non-Greek and non-Roman generals, except Hamilcar and Hannibal; but there is much confusion in the accounts transmitted to us, and it is difficult to assign the anecdotes of him recorded by Polyaenus to their proper place in his history. The chronology of the events related by Nepos is also very obscure; but according to that author and Diodorus it would appear that Datames must have died before Artaxerxes, probably 362 BC. He was succeeded by his son Ariamnes I ( Ancient Greek: ·ºàœÅŒπŒ¨ŒºŒΩŒ∑œÇ, Ari√°mnƒìs) who ruled 362 BC‚Äì330 BC as satrap of Cappadocia under Persian suzerainty.

Written by Tracey Forbes and directed by Nick Marck, it originally aired on November 30, 1999 on the WB network. In \\"Something Blue\\", a spell by Willow goes awry, blinding Giles, making Xander a literal demon magnet, and causing Buffy and Spike to fall in love and get engaged. Plot Riley invites Buffy out on a picnic. Willow and Buffy discuss the consequences of a possible relationship with Riley, who seems \\"safe\\" and unlikely to hurt her. Buffy wonders if true passion requires pain and fighting. Later, Buffy interrogates Spike, who is chained up in Giles' bathtub, but he doesn't give up much. Willow suggests a truth spell to make Spike talk. Going to Oz's place, Willow finds it emptied and realises he has had his possessions forwarded to him without getting in touch with her, crushing her last hopes of his return. That night at The Bronze, she opts to drown her sorrows in alcohol. Later, in the dorm bathroom, Willow performs a spell to let her will be granted in order to make her pain go away. However, her commands don't seem to work. Giles drops by to find out why she didn't show to help him perform the truth spell as scheduled. She feels like there's too much pressure on her that she can't live up to. Angry, she says that he can't see anything, and then Giles leaves. Giles tries to perform the spell on Spike alone, but has difficulty reading. After Giles accidentally drops the key to the chains keeping Spike captive, Spike is able to escape. While Willow and Buffy talk, one of Willow's casual comments causes Amy to become human for a brief second, before another turns her back into a rat. After Giles calls, Buffy goes to find Spike and once he's caught (by another sarcastic comment from Willow), she brings him back to Giles's apartment. While talking to Xander, Willow flippantly suggests that Buffy and Spike get married if Spike's so important. Meanwhile at Giles' place, Spike proposes to Buffy and she accepts. Xander continues to try to console Willow, but in an act of misdirected rage and grief, she calls him \\"a demon magnet.\\" While Buffy and Spike cuddle and kiss and make plans for the wedding, Giles calls Willow for help, confessing he is totally blind. He states that he is blind without his glasses, but doesn't seem to have them on. Buffy runs into Riley outside of a Bridal shop and happily tells him about the wedding, which confuses and upsets him. Xander and Anya's romantic time is interrupted by various demons that attack them. They rush to Giles' place where Xander is the one who realizes that the cause is Willow and everything she wills is coming true. D'Hoffryn, the demon responsible for making Anya a vengeance demon, comes forth and takes Willow through a portal to his demon world to make the same offer. When the gang goes to look for her, Anya recognizes the remains of a portal left by D'Hoffryn. Buffy and the rest of the group go to a crypt where they hope to stop D'Hoffryn from turning Willow into a demon. En route to the crypt, several demons attack, still drawn to Xander because of Willow's spell. In the meantime, Willow politely turns down D'Hoffryn's offer and he sends her back. Willow breaks the spell and Buffy and Spike find themselves in the middle of a kiss, much to their mutual disgust. Willow apologises and tries to make up for her messed up spell with cookies. Buffy claims she is over the whole \\"bad boy\\" thing. The next day, Buffy finds Riley and manages to convince him she was only joking about getting married; making fun of 'the panic in his eyes' at finding her gazing into a wedding dress store. Critical response Justine Larbalestier has suggested the episode pokes fun at fans \\"shipping\\" Buffy and Spike, that is inventing scenarios and writing fan fiction to allow the two characters, normally foes, to become romantically involved. The A.V. Club called it \\"a well-balanced episode\\", mixing comedy with more serious reflection on the theme of how there's no easy solution to Willow's problems. Nikki Stafford found it funny, particularly Spike's actions, though she found Buffy's reactions less than believable. Cultural references * The title comes from a wedding tradition that began in Victorian England. The full poem reads, \\"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, and a silver sixpence in her shoe.\\" Each item is supposed to bring good luck to the bride. It's also a reference to Willow, who is upset, or \\"blue\\", because of Oz while also referring to D'Hoffryn who himself is blue. *While Giles is on the phone, Spike complains that he's missing Passions, a supernatural soap opera that aired from 1999 to 2008. Continuity =Arc significance= * Crossover: Buffy briefly mentions her visit to Los Angeles (\\"I Will Remember You\\"), which took place after the previous episode. Buffy remembers that her visit with Angel lasted only minutes. * This episode foreshadows three plotlines of season six: Willow's abuse of magic for her own ends, Willow's inner capacity for vengeance, and Buffy and Spike's relationship. * This episode marks the first time Willow does a large, complex spell that goes awry. * D'Hoffryn gives Willow a talisman so that she can summon him if she changes her mind about becoming a vengeance demon. Willow will use the talisman in \\"Selfless\\" to talk to D'Hoffryn about Anya. * The \\"UC Sunnydale Lesbian Alliance\\" banner foreshadows Willow's relationship with Tara. * Willow unknowingly turns Amy back into a human, then back into a rat. Amy will not become human again until \\"Smashed\\". * Buffy admits to Willow that she feels \\"real love and passion have to go hand in hand with pain and fighting\\", and questions if a normal relationship can have the same sort of intensity. This foreshadows her violent relationship with Spike in season six, as well as the reason her relationship with Riley ultimately fails. * Buffy's request to Giles to give her away at her wedding emphasizes their surrogate father/daughter relationship. =References to other episodes= * One of the spellbooks Spike picks up bears the symbol used in the episode \\"Gingerbread\\" on the cover. * After the spell has been broken, Buffy says to Willow, \\"We may be in to a forgetting spell later.\\" In the episode \\"Tabula Rasa,\\" Willow casts a spell that unintentionally causes the gang to forget who they are. Trivia * In 2007, Alyson Hannigan would star in an episode of How I Met Your Mother entitled \\"Something Blue.\\" * In the scene where Willow confesses to Giles that she tried to perform a spell to have her will done a poster with the title \\"Murphy's Law\\" is visible over her shoulder (may only be visible on widescreen versions). * Despite the fact that it has been shown that vampires have no reflection, Spike can be seen many times in a mirror to the left of the door, visible just past Giles' shoulder and in the glass front of the bookshelf next to his chair.

History A software package famous for its use in the production of numerous Oscar-winning movies such as The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Jurassic Park. =AliasWavefront Merger= This was widely seen as the result of Microsoft purchasing Softimage in an attempt to take over the 3D computer graphics market. Silicon Graphics responded by purchasing Alias Systems Corporation, and their two major competitors, Wavefront, and the French company TDI (Thomson Digital Images) for their Explore, IPR, and GUI technologies. Thus SGI created the super-company AliasWavefront. Wavefront's programmers continued to reside in California but the management of the company was carried out in Toronto, Canada. =Autodesk Era= In 1996 AliasWavefront announced the release of Maya which incorporated aspects of all 3 software suites. Wavefront was renamed to Alias Technologies and acquired by Autodesk in 2005. Some of the technology under Autodesk's ownership is still sold today as part of Mayahttps://www.cc.gatech.edu/scivis/userguide/resources/software/advvis.html. Architecture In contrast to many modern day (2011) computer graphics animation software, TAV was a set of independent programs that each focused on one aspect of image synthesis as opposed to a monolithic product. The collection of these smaller programs formed the entire suite based on simple interchange of mostly ASCII file formats such as OBJ. The major components of the TAV software suite included: Model, Paint, Dynamation, Kinemation, Preview, and fcheck. Composer was also available as an add-on for compositing of imagery. Many primitive utility programs such as graphics conversion were included in the toolkit and were frequently employed for batch processing via shell scripts. The modular nature allowed these loosely coupled lightweight programs to start-up quickly with relatively small memory footprints. It was not uncommon to run several instances of the Model or Preview package, each working on different aspects of the same project. As TAV only ran on the Silicon Graphics platform it enjoyed significant performance advantages over software-only based solutions due to its use of SGI's specialized graphics hardware supporting IrisGL, a precursor to OpenGL. =Component programs= fcheck - or 'Frame Check' is an image sequence viewer. fcheck loaded image files from disk into RAM and played them back at monitor synced frame rates for real time playback evaluation. It features the ability to view the RGBA (and Z-depth in the case of RLA) channels independently, variable frame rate and the ability to draw directly into the buffer. This program still ships with Maya. Model - a polygon and patch 3d modeler. It read and wrote OBJ files. It also had the ability to manipulate UVs, Normals and assign material associations saved in the MTL file format. Included a command language for automation in the form of scripts, or aliases. Since there was no 'undo' feature, a common automated sequence would copy data to a spare place before modifying it - in essence, the users made their own 'undo'. Alongside direct manipulation of the vertex data, procedural deformers were available to sculpt the surfaces using common geometric transformations such as 'bend'. Paint was an image editing program for manipulation of bitmap graphics - its texture map support focused on the RLA, SGI, Cineon (now DPX) and TIFF file formats. Support for 16 bit integer textures, sequencing capabilities for rotoscoping in addition to paint cloning from adjacent frames in the timeline. Dynamation was a particle animation and rendering program capable of importing an OBJ to interact with. It accomplished native rendering using a hardware render buffer featuring a z-buffer. It drove the animations using a combination of predefined field objects & programmatic 'expressions' as well as rigid body mesh collision support. This technology is still being used in the Maya product today. Preview was animation package that referenced OBJ files from disk, managed hierarchies and assigned animated channel data to attributes such as translation and rotation. It allowed association of primitive non- linear deformations such as bends and waves to geometry. It lacked a native undo feature. Like Model, included a command language that allowed for alias, or script development to automate tasks such as 'undo'. Other features included placement and preview of lights, manipulation of OBJ MTL files, and facilitation of scanline or wire frame rendering via an external render module. A unique feature to draw every Nth polygon of a model, was essential for visualizing animation of 'heavy' scenes during manipulation. Render featured raytraced-shadows, raytraced reflections, transparency, texture maps, bump mapping, Lambert and Phong reflections. Kinemation - an 'advanced' animation system that allowed for the manipulation of geometry using Inverse Kinematics (IK), geometric skinning to 'bones' featuring lattice based deformations. The deformed meshes were exported a series of OBJ's read into preview for assembly with other scene components. Composer, though not an initial member of the family, is a time-line based (similar to after effects) compositing and editing system with color corrections, keying, convolution filters, and animation capabilities. It supported 8 and 16 bit file formats as well as Cineon and early 'movie' file formats such as SGI Indeo, MPEG video and QuickTime.

Plot Buffy and Riley finally talk. As much as Riley wants to tell Buffy who he really is, he can't, but Buffy is able to guess based on the evidence of the past several weeks. Riley is amazed by her talents and abilities, but when she confesses that she's the Slayer, he doesn't know what that is. An earthquake hits and although it is mild, the memory of the last earthquake in Sunnydale disturbs Buffy. As Xander cleans up some of the earthquake damage, he tells Spike that if he's living there he'll have to do some of the housework. Willow checks in with Buffy and informs her of the aftershock party that is taking place in one of the dorm buildings that lost power. Buffy goes to Giles, fearing that the world is going to come to an end, but he dismisses her worry, thinking that the earthquake was just a normal California occurrence. Riley pumps Forrest for information on the Slayer, which Forrest thinks is just a myth that monsters made up. A demon goes berserk and attacks Riley and Forrest. They manage to subdue it and wonder at the strange activity their demonic captives have been exhibiting since the earthquake. At the party, Willow sees Percy, whom she tutored in high school. Laurie, Percy's date, objects to his talking with Willow and suggests that they go somewhere else. Meanwhile, a guy mixing drinks in one of the dorm rooms has his throat slit by a large demon. Willow overhears Percy trying to soothe Laurie by describing Willow as an \\"Egghead\\" and \\"Captain of the Nerd Squad\\". Depressed, Willow goes into one of the dorm rooms to lie on a bed, but when the lights come back on, she finds herself next to the body that was mutilated by the demon. Returning home, Xander finds Spike wearing a Hawaiian shirt and shorts because he shrunk his own clothes. When Spike tries to threaten him, Xander quickly loses his temper and tears Spike down verbally, harshly informing him that no one is scared of him anymore and that he's not even worth the effort to pummel. Riley shoots baskets with Forrest and broods about Buffy when Graham walks in and tells them about the murder. Riley orders the others to report to Prof. Walsh, while he checks the situation out for himself. Willow fills everyone in about the body she found, and about Percy talking badly about her. After she shows everyone the symbol carved into the student's chest, Giles says it is definitely the end of the world again. Buffy hunts down this demon, and finds it at a mausoleum where it is collecting the bones of a small child. She fights with the demon, but it escapes and she runs into Riley. He tries to convince her to give a relationship between them a chance, but because of all the pain in her past, she tells him no. Research leads them to find that the demon needs the blood of a man, the bones of a child, and the Word of Valios to perform a ritual called the 'Sacrifice of Three', which will destroy the world. Riley talks to his team and sends them out to find and kill the demon. Willow and Xander walk in on Spike trying to kill himself by falling on a stake. Their appearance makes him miss the stake. Pitying him, Willow insists that they take him along, and Xander reluctantly agrees. Out on patrol, Buffy runs into Riley again and they resume their earlier conversation. He tells Buffy that she needs to be more positive, to not look for the bad in the situation. He tells her he doesn't care about her past and begs her to just take a chance on him, but she continues to refuse. Later, instead of showing appreciation for their efforts, Spike taunts Willow and Xander about things ranging from their love lives to their \\"uselessness\\" to Buffy while they make their way to Giles' apartment. Though Willow and Xander protest his words as untrue, Spike clearly strikes a nerve. Giles discovers that the Word of Valios is actually a talisman that he has in his possession. The demons have already made their way to his apartment and they beat him up badly before taking the talisman. The gang finds Giles and they head off to the remains of Sunnydale High School after he informs them that the ritual is to open the Hellmouth. The gang makes it to the remains of the library where three demons are performing the ritual. A fight breaks out, and then one of the demons jumps into the Hellmouth, revealing that they are the sacrifice for the ritual. A second demon attacks Spike, and after several hits, he finally hits back. He realizes he can hurt demons without the chip hurting him. Ecstatic about being able to fight again, Spike promptly beats the demon senseless, and proceeds to throw it into the Hellmouth. While the rest of the gang escape the tottering building, Riley shows up to help Buffy fight. The third demon makes its way into the Hellmouth and Buffy goes in after it. Thanks to a cable and hook Riley attached to her belt, Buffy is pulled out of the Hellmouth along with the third demon. The world is saved again. Afterwards, Riley tries to keep up his secret identity, but Buffy's friends pretty much know who he is by his clothes, while Spike evades detection by posing as a \\"friend of Xander's\\" with a bad American accent. The next day, Buffy goes to Riley's dorm, where he says how upset he is at himself for allowing her and her friends to find out about him. Telling him that everything will be okay, she kisses him. Back in Xander's basement apartment, Spike is eager for another brawl and tries to persuade Willow and Xander to go out for some more demon-hunting rather than watching television, but they are disinclined to do so. Arc Significance Starting with this episode, Marc Blucas appears in the title credits, after Alyson Hannigan, recognizing his increasing importance to the season and to the show in general with his character Riley Finn becoming Buffy's love interest as well as being a field leader for The Initiative.

The town that developed on the northern shore of the bay, also called Saldanha, was incorporated with five other towns into the Saldanha Bay Local Municipality in 2000. The current population of the municipality is estimated at 72,000. The place is mentioned in the first edition of John Locke's Two Treatises of Government as an example of the state of nature.Second Treatise, sec. 14. Locke replaced the reference to \\"Soldania\\" with a story told by Garcilaso de la Vega about a desert island in subsequent editions (Peter Laslett, ed., Two Treatises of Government, by John Locke, student edition [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988], 277n). Saldanha Bay's location makes it a paradise for the watersport enthusiast, and its local economy being strongly dependent on fishing, mussels, seafood processing, the steel industry and the harbour. Furthermore, its sheltered harbour plays an important part in the Sishen-Saldanha iron-ore project (connected by the Sishen-Saldanha Railway Line) at which Saldanha Steel takes center stage. Geography Saldanha Bay is located about north west of Cape Town. It faces southwest and is 11 km long and 12 km wide. The Langebaan Lagoon, a SE prolongation of the bay, extends for 14 km southeastwards from the SE corner of the inner bay by Langebaan. File:Saldanhabay.JPGOuter bay with surf pounding the shore File:TF.Langebaan.jpgView of the inner bay from Langebaan File:Laangebaan Lagoon, West Coast National Park.jpgView of the Langebaan Lagoon File:Saldanha Bay Sunset.jpgView of a fishing house situated near the center of the bay History Saldanha Bay is named after Ant√≥nio de Saldanha, captain of a vessel in Albuquerque's fleet which visited South Africa in 1503. The name was first given to Table Bay, where Saldanha's ship cast anchor. On Table Bay being given its present name in 1601, the older appellation was transferred to the bay now called after Saldanha. In 1781 a British squadron under Commodore George Johnstone seized six Dutch East Indiamen, which, fearing an attack on Cape Town, had taken refuge in Saldanha Bay. This was the only achievement, so far as South Africa was concerned, of the expedition despatched to seize Cape Town during the war of 1781‚Äì1783. Diplomat Edmund Roberts visited the Bay in 1833. He noted that it was \\"well sheltered from violent winds, having a sufficient depth of water, but the country is very sandy and agriculture but little attended to; a few cattle and sheep are raised among the scanty herbage.\\" He suggested that it was an uneventful area to visit, except for a few areas in the Bay where whales resided during his visit. Saldanha Bay is also home to numerous fish canneries. The most notable of these is the Saldanha Bay Canning Company, founded by James Kasner and Ellis Silverman in 1905. With strong historic military links Saldanha is also host to a Naval training base and the South African Military Academy. The SAS Saldanha Nature Reserve offers a display of wildflowers during late winter and spring while southern right whales also visit the waters in and around the nature reserve. The area has a Mediterranean climate but the annual rainfall is quite low; it verges on the desert region of Namaqualand. =Modern day= The port developed into a modern harbour only recently, when it became necessary to facilitate the export of iron ore from the Northern Cape. This required the construction of a railway more than 800 kilometres to the mines at Sishen in the Northern Cape and the construction of a deepwater jetty in Saldanha Bay to accommodate Capesize ore carrier ships.

Armed with weapons, they go to the rec room only for Buffy to discover that it's a surprise party for her 19th birthday. At the party, Giles feels out of place, especially when Buffy introduces Riley as her boyfriend, and brags about how wonderful Professor Walsh is. Now aware that he is able to hurt and kill demons, Spike moves out of Xander's basement. Professor Walsh is informed that Buffy is the Slayer. After revealing Riley's 17 captures and kills, she inquires about how many \\"hostiles\\" Buffy has killed. Uncomfortable, Buffy initially keeps quiet to avoid bragging, but from Buffy's conversation with Riley afterward, the viewer can infer that Buffy is forced to admit that she has killed hundreds of vampires and saved the world multiple times. Riley is impressed and intimidated; as he puts it, \\"I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse.\\" Meanwhile, Giles discovers that a powerful demon is about to rise, and calls Buffy, but Willow informs him that she is with Professor Walsh. Giles goes to talk with Maggie Walsh about Buffy, unaware that she knows Buffy's identity and of her position in the Initiative. He has an immediate dislike for her, and is offended when she says that Buffy lacks a father figure. Willow and Xander go with Giles to the cemetery to find the demon. They are very late and fail to find the demon. Instead, they find the area incredibly clean, which Willow suggests is the work of the Initiative. She and Xander go on about how thorough the operation is, only to discover that Giles never knew about the Initiative or that Riley and Professor Walsh are behind it. Again feeling incredibly out of the loop and unwanted, Giles sends Willow and Xander away, offering to stay in case anything happens, but after a few seconds dejectedly leaves. Ethan Rayne walks out of the shadows, speaking of interesting things to come, only to be caught when Giles re-enters the mausoleum. Giles prepares to beat Ethan, sparing him only with Ethan's hastily uttered promise of information. Going out for a drink, Ethan tells Giles that the underworld is being threatened by the Initiative, especially by something called 314. Whatever the Initiative is doing, it's throwing everything out of balance. Buffy and Riley spar together, both holding back at first until they decide not to. Buffy kicks Riley hard enough to send him flying across the room. Meanwhile, Giles and Ethan get very drunk, with Giles opening up about how left out he feels and his annoyance that the Initiative has the demons running scared when he has been fighting evil for 20 years. Ethan flirts with their waitress and gives his number to her. Willow and Tara meet to practice magic, and a simple magical exercise to float a rose goes awry, causing the rose to fly wildly around the room. When he wakes the next morning, Giles discovers he has been transformed into a horned demon with incredible strength. He breaks the phone trying to make a call, then breaks the door off its hinges as he tries to leave the house. At breakfast, Willow lies to Buffy about where she was, saying she was practicing magic alone. She does mention that some magical force interfered with the spell she was attempting to cast. Buffy realizes she never told Giles about Riley and the Initiative. Giles goes to Xander's basement and tries to get him to help, but Xander doesn't recognize and cannot understand Giles, who is speaking in a demonic language. Xander starts to throw things at him and Giles runs away. The gang finds Giles' place destroyed, and are worried that the same demon that went to Xander was responsible for hurting or killing Giles. Walking through the cemetery, Giles runs into Spike, who is in the midst of searching for a new place to live. Spike recognizes Giles, and identifies him as a Fyarl demon. Because he speaks the language, Spike agrees to help find Ethan and fix things, for the price of two hundred dollars. Riley shows up at Giles' apartment where everyone is researching the demon. After finding the demon in Giles' books, they determine it can only be killed with a silver object. Spike tries to figure out how to drive Giles' car while telling Giles of his experiences with Fyarl demons. Apparently they are extremely stupid, love destroying things, and have an ability that Spike describes as 'that thing with the mucus' to spray goo that hardens like rock. Upon spotting Professor Walsh, Giles makes Spike stop the car so he can chase her down the street in return for her comments in their last conversation. Spike gets information out of the waitress that Ethan flirted with, and finds out where he lives. Breaking into the magic shop, Buffy finds a receipt for materials purchased by Ethan Rayne. Trying to escape the commando vehicles chasing after them, demon Giles jumps out of the car while the commandos continue their pursuit on Spike. Spike later crashes the car while trying to get away. Demon Giles charges into Ethan's motel room, and attacks him. Buffy and Riley arrive on scene and while Riley takes care of Ethan, Buffy fights with demon Giles. With a letter opener she took from Giles' place, Buffy stabs the demon, but then she looks into its eyes and realizes the demon is Giles. The letter opener turned out not to be made of pure silver. Giles is turned back into a human and Ethan is arrested by Riley. While Giles goes to watch Ethan get put away, Buffy and Riley talk about her abilities again. Buffy apologizes for not telling Giles about Riley and the Initiative and promises to tell him everything in the future, but Giles is worried about her safety and whom she trusts. Professor Walsh is upset that Riley disobeyed orders for Buffy, but says she thinks that Buffy will \\"work out\\". Passing through security doors, Walsh enters a room labeled \\"314.\\" External links  \\"A New Man\\" at BuffyGuide.com Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson ","title":"A New Man"},{"id":"2353744","text":"Casamancian Autonomous Movement (in French: Mouvement Autonome Casaman√ßais) was a political party in Casamance, southern Senegal.

Plot synopsis Willow, Anya, and Xander are playing three-handed poker since Buffy is elsewhere. Xander tells his plan to sell supposedly healthy (but nasty tasting) Boost bars. They question the intentions of the Initiative. In a field test against the commandos, Buffy impresses Professor Walsh. The next day in the cafeteria, Buffy gushes about her performance to Willow. Willow confirms that the Scooby Gang, including Buffy, will assemble at The Bronze that night. Willow obviously misses Buffy, who has been rather busy of late. Giles visits Spike at his new crypt to pay the money he owes from the previous episode in which Spike charged him for his help. Spike makes it clear that he will not help them again and wants nothing to do with the Scoobies. Riley takes Buffy into the Initiative. Professor Walsh gives her a tour of the impressive facility. Buffy is made a member of the team. However, a slip from Buffy indicating her prior knowledge of the Initiative's behavior modification research (viz. Spike's chip) does not go unnoticed. Tara tries to give a crystal to Willow, a family heirloom, but Willow refuses to accept the powerful magical implement. Tara invites Willow to try some spells with the crystal that night. Willow reluctantly declines due to her plans with the Scoobies. Professor Walsh enters Room 314 in the secure lab area to check up on her special project: a part-demon, part-human, part robot creature named Adam. Buffy is an hour late meeting her friends at the Bronze, and when she does show, she brings Riley and the team. Buffy reveals that she is now working with the Initiative. Willow questions how much trust Buffy should put in the organization. Suddenly Buffy rushes off with the team. Abandoned by Buffy, Willow goes to Tara's dorm room after all. Buffy and the commandos deploy in two teams in search of a Polgara demon. They are instructed to keep the demon's arms, which contain vicious spears, intact. Forrest spots Hostile 17 (Spike) and sends his team after the vampire. Spike gets away, but they shoot him with a tracer to be able to track him later. The Polgara demon attacks the Alpha team; Buffy and Riley, fighting together, apparently kill it. Stimulated, they have sex (for the first time) in Riley's dorm room. Professor Walsh watches them from a secret camera. Waking up in the morning, Buffy is a little surprised to see that Riley is still in bed by her side. Riley takes a number of pills (\\"my vitamins,\\" he says). They talk, but when Buffy asks about \\"314\\", Riley immediately receives a call from Professor Walsh with an assignment. Walsh and Dr. Angleman decide that it is time to go with their plan to get rid of Buffy. Desperate and unable to shake off the commandos, Spike goes to Giles for help. Giles tries to remove the tracer from Spike's shoulder, but it's in deep. Riley reinforces Forrest's team. With the soldiers gone, Walsh summons Buffy for a very easy mission and arms her with a stun rifle. Wearing a heart monitor and sound camera, Buffy goes out alone. The mission is a trap. The rifle shorts out, the exit is barred, and Buffy is set upon by two powerful demons armed with axes. With Willow doing a masking spell to buy time and Spike babbling from drink in lieu of anesthesia, Giles finally manages to remove the tracer from the vampire's shoulder. They flush it down the toilet just in time to misdirect Riley and his team. Buffy kills the demons, but in the fight the monitor falls off. With no reported heartbeat or movement Walsh assumes that she is dead. When Riley returns, she informs him that Buffy is dead and adds a few more lies. In the middle of her \\"eulogy\\" Buffy picks up the camera and reveals, in full view of Riley, Walsh's trap. Riley walks out on Walsh. The Initiative has grafted an arm from the Polgara demon to Adam. Walsh, upset that she had to sacrifice Buffy and Riley's loyalty to safeguard her great project (Adam), goes to Room 314 and speaks as if to the sleeping creature. Adam wakes and skewers Walsh with his new arm spear, saying \\"Mommy.\\" She falls over dead. Buffy returns to Giles' place and briefly tells the story. Continuity =Arc significance= * One of the overarching themes of Season Four, Buffy's friends feeling alienated from her role as the Slayer, is portrayed when Willow feels left out and hesitant about Buffy joining the Initiative. In \\"A New Man\\" it was Giles who felt left out of Buffy's life and duties. This theme culminates in the episode \\"Primeval\\". * The fact that Riley is still with Buffy in the morning is a marker of his morally unambiguous intentions, unlike the soulless Angelus or the libertine Parker. * Learning that Professor Walsh is up to no good, Riley walks out on the Initiative. After she is dead he returns to help because of his loyalty to his teammates and his belief in the mission of the Initiative. * Adam will become the Big Bad of the season, taking over from Professor Walsh. * Willow and Tara's relationship starts to take a romantic turn although no romantic affection is explicitly shown. The network was very reluctant to allow an explicit lesbian relationship.Recorded commentary on the DVD. * Willow and Tara's relationship is foreshadowed a couple of times in this episode. First, when Willow prays for the heart she needs in the poker game. Next, when Willow notes \\"everybody's getting spanked but me\\", alluding to the fact that she is the only one without a bed buddy. Production The Initiative interiors were shot in a hangar at the Lockheed 'Skunk Works' facility in Palmdale, CA.Recorded commentary on the DVD.

It was originally described by Ananda Coomaraswamy in 1904 as uraninite, but recognized as a new species by Wyndham R. Dunstan. It was so named on account of its high percentage of thorium; it also contains the oxides of uranium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium and neodymium. Helium is present, and the mineral is slightly less radioactive than pitchblende, but is harder to shield due to its high energy gamma rays. It is common in the alluvial gem-gravels of Sri Lanka, where it occurs mostly as water worn, small, heavy, black, cubic crystals. The largest crystals are usually near 1.5 cm. Larger crystals, up to , have been reported from Madagascar. Chemistry Based on color, specific gravity and composition three types of thorianite are distinguished: *Œ±-thorianite *Œ≤-thorianite *Œ≥-thorianite Thorianite and uraninite form a complete solid solution series in synthetic and natural material. The division between the two species is at Th:U = 1:1 with U possibly making up to 46.50% and Th ranging up to 87.9%. Rare earths, chiefly Ce, substitute for Th in amounts up to 8% by weight. Ce is probably present as Ce4+. Complete series is known in synthetic material between CeO2 \\\\- PrO2 \\\\- ThO2 \\\\- UO2. Small amounts of Fe3+ and Zr also may be isomorphous with Th.

He was born in Cargins, Co Galway, Ireland and educated at the Jesuit College, Toulouse, France (obtaining an MD in 1758) and the School of Medicine in Montpellier, France. He was awarded a DCL by Oxford University in 1790. He initially practised as a physician in the West Indies but switched to law and was made Attorney-General in Grenada in 1779. In 1784, he accompanied his lifelong friend George, Lord Macartney, whom he first met in the West Indies, to Madras to negotiate peace with Tipu Sultan, for which service Staunton was created a baronet of Ireland, of Cargins in the County of Galway on 31 October 1785. Staunton was elected in February 1787 a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1793, Staunton was named Secretary to the British mission to the Chinese Imperial court. This diplomatic and trade mission would be headed by Lord Macartney. Although the Macartney Embassy returned to London without obtaining any concession from China, the mission could have been termed a success because it brought back detailed observations. Staunton was charged with producing the official account of the expedition after their return. It was published 1797 under the title An Authentic Account of an Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China. This multi-volume work was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney and from the papers of Sir Erasmus Gower, who was Commander of the expedition. Sir Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society, was responsible for selecting and arranging engraving of the illustrations in this official record.Banks, Joseph.

Carl is the underboss of the Grove Street Families, a street gang based in the fictional Los Santos, San Andreas, which is led by his older brother Sean \\"Sweet\\" Johnson. While playing San Andreas, the player controls the movements and actions of CJ as he proceeds through the storyline and finishes missions. Throughout the game, he slowly rises in prominence and becomes a shareholder in various successful businesses, including a chop shop, car dealership, and casino, as he completes increasingly difficult tasks. Character design Carl's physical appearance is modeled after Los Angeles- based rapper and actor Young Maylay, who also provided the character's voice and motion-capture work. When asked about the character model for Carl, Young Maylay stated that the development team took \\"very professional\\" photographs of him to model Carl. =Customisation= Unlike the principal characters of previous Grand Theft Auto games, Carl's appearance is highly customisable, as the player can purchase a wide variety of different hair cuts, tattoos, and clothing for him. Certain clothes, tattoos, and hairstyles improve Carl's standing with his fellow gang members as well as his sex appeal to his selective girlfriends. The game implements a tracking system for various skills and abilities, each of which gradually improves as it is used or practiced and slowly diminishes as it is neglected. As Carl rides bikes, drives cars and motorcycles, and flies aircraft, his skill improves in each. The same is true for the weapons that he uses. The player can choose to exercise, which improves skills such as stamina (which allows Carl to sprint for longer durations) and muscle (which visibly increases Carl's muscle tone). Visiting fast food restaurants and regularly eating their large meals will increase Carl's size over time, eventually leading to him becoming overweight. Carl can lose this weight again by frequently exercising. Biography =Background= Carl was born to Beverly Johnson and an unnamed father in 1968, in his family home, located on Grove Street in the Ganton neighborhood of Los Santos. As a child, he got along well with his mother and older brother Sean (nicknamed \\"Sweet\\"), though not with his father, whom he barely remembers; as he states at one point, \\"[He] never really had a father.\\" Later, Carl became the middle child of the family after the birth of his sister Kendl, and the middle son after the birth of his younger brother Brian. At a young age, Carl, Sweet, and Brian befriended Melvin \\"Big Smoke\\" Harris and Lance \\"Ryder\\" Wilson, and all five eventually joined the Grove Street Families. While Sweet became the gang's leader, Carl, Big Smoke, and Ryder became high-ranking lieutenants, with Carl himself as the underboss. In 1987, most of Los Santos' gangs started trafficking drugs, allowing them to expand. However, due to Sweet morally despising drugs and refusing to become involved in the business, despite Big Smoke advising him otherwise, the Families started to lose their influence, to the point that they were almost completely wiped out ‚Äì an opportunity which their sworn rivals, the Ballas, planned to take advantage of. At the same time, Carl began to distance himself from his friends and family after Brian's death; though the exact circumstances of the murder are never revealed, Sweet accuses Carl of having had the chance to save Brian but choosing to do nothing. Soon afterwards, Carl decided to leave his gang life behind by moving to Liberty City, where he began working with Joey Leone in the car theft business. =Return to San Andreas= The game's main storyline begins with Carl's return to Los Santos following the death of his mother in a drive-by shooting in 1992. Upon his arrival, Carl is confronted by LSPD officers Frank Tenpenny, Edward \\"Eddie\\" Pulaski, and Jimmy Hernandez, three highly corrupt members of the city's community policing unit, C.R.A.S.H. Tenpenny and his associates warn Carl early on that they intend to frame him for the murder of police officer Ralph Pendlebury, whom C.R.A.S.H. had killed to prevent him from exposing their illegal activities. They also force Carl to work for them in exchange for his safety and the safety of his family and friends. After his confrontation with C.R.A.S.H., Carl returns to Grove Street, where he is reunited with Sweet, Kendl, Big Smoke, and Ryder. Carl learns that the Grove Street Families have lost much of their power and influence to rival gangs, particularly the Ballas, during his absence. Shortly after his return, Carl aids his allies in re-establishing the Grove Street Families' dominance by expelling crack cocaine dealers, acquiring weapons, and regaining lost gang territory. Carl aids his friend Jeffrey \\"OG Loc\\" Cross in jump starting his rapping career, in the process destroying the career of successful rapper Madd Dogg, and is later introduced to Kendl's boyfriend Cesar Vialpando, the leader of the Varrio Los Aztecas street gang, whom Sweet despises, but Carl befriends him, upon discovering that Cesar genuinely cares for his sister. However, the Grove Street Families' resurgence is short-lived, as Carl discovers that Smoke and Ryder have betrayed the gang by forming alliances with C.R.A.S.H. and the Ballas and arranged the attack that killed his mother, which was actually meant for Sweet, in an attempt to wipe out the Families. Sweet is ambushed by a group of Ballas on that same day and is wounded in the subsequent gunfight. Carl arrives on the scene and saves his brother's life but both are arrested by the police. Sweet is tried, convicted of several felonies, and sentenced to life in prison whilst Carl is forced by C.R.A.S.H. to move to the countryside outside Los Santos. In the aftermath of these events, the Grove Street Families lose their power and influence once more and subsequently relinquish all of their territory to their rival gangs, who begin flooding Los Santos with drugs, under Big Smoke, Ryder, and C.R.A.S.H.'s supervision. =Exile and new alliances= During his time in the countryside, Carl is introduced to hippie weed manufacturer \\"The Truth\\", aids Cesar's cousin Catalina in performing a number of robberies, being dumped by her after a racing competition, and takes part in two illegal street races where he meets and befriends a blind Chinese-American Triad leader, Wu Zi \\"Woozie\\" Mu. After his brief stay in the countryside, Carl and his associates head north for San Fierro, where they establish a vehicle chop shop and dealership. Carl works for the local Triads, strengthening his ties with Woozie and his superior Ran Fa Li in the process, and infiltrates and destroys San Andreas' largest drug cartel, the Loco Syndicate, which had been supplying the Ballas with drugs. With some help from Cesar and the Triads, Carl exacts revenge on Ryder by killing him during a meeting with the Loco Syndicate, alongside two of the syndicate's leaders, Jizzy B. and T-Bone Mendez. Following the destruction of the Loco Syndicate, Carl is contacted by its main leader, Mike Toreno, revealed to be an undercover government agent. Carl begins working for Toreno in exchange for Sweet's release from prison and subsequently ventures into the desert and Las Venturas. During this time, Carl acquires a pilot's license, a jetpack from the Area 69 military base for The Truth, and later, in Las Venturas, saves Madd Dogg's life by intervening in his attempted suicide. He helps Woozie, who is facing trouble in opening a casino due to the Mafia, plan a robbery of the rival Caligula's Casino, run by the mob, and rescues music producer Kent Paul and singer Maccer from the desert as a favour for The Truth. Carl earns the mob's trust by working for Ken Rosenberg, the manager of Caligula's and an old friend of Paul's, and for mob boss Salvatore Leone, before helping Rosenberg, Paul, and Maccer escape from Salvatore's clutches and carrying out the heist alongside the Triads. Following the successful robbery of Caligula's, Woozie opens the Four Dragons Casino and invites Carl to become its co-owner. At the same time, Carl is betrayed by C.R.A.S.H. and almost killed by Pulaski. After Hernandez, who turned on his partners, dies while distracting Pulaski, Carl chases him when he attempts to flee, and ultimately murders him. At the conclusion of these events, Carl and his associates begin preparing for their return to Los Santos. Madd Dogg approaches Carl to become his manager. =Return to Los Santos= Upon his return to Los Santos, Carl regains control of Madd Dogg's mansion, which he had sold to the Vagos gang, later rebuilding his career with Rosenberg, Paul, and Maccer's help, whom he recruits to work for Madd Dogg, and reclaiming his stolen rhyme book from OG Loc. Around the same time, Carl completes one last job for Toreno, who keeps his word and has Sweet released from prison. Although delighted to have his brother back, Sweet refuses to leave their gang life behind and talks Carl into re-establishing the Grove Street Families once more. Together, they take back Grove Street and begin slowly rebuilding their gang by removing drug dealers and drug addicts from the streets. Meanwhile, Tenpenny is tried for his crimes but all charges are dropped due to a lack of evidence, resulting in a city-wide riot. In the midst of the chaos, Carl aids Cesar in re-establishing his gang, the Varrio Los Aztecas, before confronting and ultimately killing Big Smoke at his crack palace penthouse. Afterwards, Carl pursues Tenpenny in a car chase which ultimately ends with Tenpenny crashing in front of the Johnson house. Carl prepares to shoot Tenpenny, but Sweet stops him as Tenpenny is already dying from his injuries and shooting him would leave evidence behind. With Tenpenny dead, all loose ends in Carl's life are resolved and the city returns to its normal state. At the conclusion of the game, Madd Dogg visits the Johnson house and announces that he has received a gold record for his new album. Everyone inside discusses how they must shift their focus to maintaining the gang and their business ventures and otherwise keep a low profile. Influences and analysis Young Maylay stated that he was influenced by his own life when portraying Carl. \\"[The development team] wanted authentic L.A., that's where I'm from and they knew that, so that's what I gave 'em,\\" he added. \\"I put Maylay on CJ. I make him as much me as I can, without too much changing of the script.\\" Reception The character of Carl Johnson received critical acclaim after the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and has been included in many lists of the best characters in video games. Jesse Schedeen of IGN included CJ in his list of Grand Theft Auto Favorite Badasses, stating, \\"Of all the protagonists in all the GTA games, few are as compelling or flat out badass as Carl \\"CJ\\" Johnson,\\" and also went on to praise the character customisation and available assets. Crave Online's Paul Tamburro placed Carl eighth in his Top 10 Most Memorable GTA Characters, stating that \\"it was refreshing to take control of a character who was considerate about when and when not to commit wanton mass-slaughtering.\\" Matthew Cooper of Sabotage Times placed the character in his list of the top 10 characters in the Grand Theft Auto series, stating that Carl Johnson \\"was the first to appear with a conscience, the first that didn't seem to enjoy killing copious numbers of people.\\" GameDaily listed Carl among their list of the best black characters in video games, refusing the idea that he reinforces negative stereotypes since he is \\"more ghetto-born James Bond than straight-up gangsta\\". Similarly, Larry Hester of Complex Gaming placed Carl second on his list of the 10 Best Black Characters in Video Games, naming him the \\"gangbanger with a good heart.\\" In 2012, GamesRadar placed Carl 77th on their list of the 100 Best Heroes in Video Games, saying that \\"few [Grand Theft Auto] heroes have been as charismatic as him, and few likely will in the future.\\" UGO Networks have placed Carl as the second character who most deserves his own live-action film. In 2008, The Age ranked Carl as the 33rd greatest Xbox character of all time, noting him as \\"the most humble\\" of Grand Theft Auto anti-heroes, and as \\"one of the first strong African-American lead characters in any major videogame.\\" Although Carl ultimately did not make the cut, Game Informer staff considered his inclusion in their \\"30 characters that defined a decade\\" collection, with Matt Helgeson saying, \\"He could have easily been another gangster stereotype, but by the end of San Andreas we see CJ as a flawed, but ultimately good man who did the best he could in the worst of circumstances.\\" In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Carl \\"CJ\\" Johnson as the 22nd top video game character of all time.

Pierre Laffitte (February 21, 1823 ‚Äì January 4, 1903) was a French positivist. Laffitte was born at B√©guey, Gironde. Residing at Paris as a teacher of mathematics, he became a disciple of Auguste Comte, who appointed him his literary executor. On the schism of the Positivist body which followed Comte's death, he was recognized as head of the section which accepted the full Comtian doctrine; the other section adhered to √âmile Littr√©, who rejected the religion of humanity as inconsistent with the materialism of Comte's earlier period. From 1853 Laffitte delivered Positivist lectures in the room formerly occupied by Comte in the rue Monsieur le Prince. He published Les Grands Types de l'humanit√© (1875) and Cours de philosophie premi√®re (1889). In 1893 he was appointed to the new chair founded at the Coll√®ge de France for the exposition of the general history of science, and it was largely due to his inspiration that a statue to Comte was erected in the Place de la Sorbonne in 1902. Laffitte died in Paris. Lafitte with a delegation of positivists visited Constantinople in 1877 visited Midhat Pasha to advocate positivist principles as a non-Christian, modern system.

His 15 books of non-fiction dealt with everything from history and politics to education and community development. An avid sailor, Cameron wrote several books about ships and the sea. He was the author of a young adult novel and a thriller, both set in Nova Scotia where he lived for more than 40 years. Two of his books, The Education of Everett Richardson (1977 and 2019) and The Living Beach (1998), are included in Atlantic Canada's 100 Greatest Books.Adams, Trevor and Clare, Stephen Patrick.

Silver Donald Cameron in conversation with George Monbiot as part of the Green Interview series Cameron's only stage play, The Prophet at Tantramar, was about Leon Trotsky's month-long confinement in a prisoner-of-war camp in Amherst, Nova Scotia, and was also produced as a radio drama, one of more than 50 Cameron wrote for both CBC Radio and CBC Television. In addition, he produced radio and television documentaries, as well as writing and narrating two documentary films for The Green Interview, Bhutan: The Pursuit of Gross National Happiness (2010) and Salmon Wars: Salmon Farms, Wild Fish and the Future of Communities (2012). His magazine articles numbered in the hundreds and his newspaper columns appeared in The Globe and Mail and the Halifax Chronicle Herald. He also wrote extensively for provincial and federal government departments as well as for corporate and non-profit clients. Cameron served as writer-in- residence at two universities in Nova Scotia as well as at the University of Prince Edward Island. He was dean of the School of Community Studies at Cape Breton University and taught at Dalhousie University, the University of British Columbia and the University of New Brunswick. One of Cameron's last projects involved a series of video interviews with environmental thinkers, writers and activists that appeared on subscription website \\"The Green Interview\\". Interviewees include Vandana Shiva, Farley Mowat, James Lovelock, Jane Goodall and David Orton. Cameron's writing and journalism earned him many awards, and in 2012, Cameron received both the Order of Canada and the Order of Nova Scotia. Early life and education Donald Cameron was born in 1937 in Toronto, the son of Hazel (Robertson) and Dr. Maxwell A. Cameron. He joked that, at age two, he fled to British Columbia, taking his parents with him.McLeod, Paul. \\"Wadih Fares, Silver Donald Cameron awarded Order of Canada\\". Halifax Chronicle Herald, June 29, 2012 His father was the head of the faculty of education at UBC beginning the mid 1940s. He grew up mostly in Vancouver and attended the University of British Columbia, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1960. He earned his Master of Arts at the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 and returned to UBC to teach for two years before leaving for the University of London, where he received his Ph.D. in 1967. He based his doctoral thesis on his study of the structures in six major novels by Walter Scott. He served as a postdoctoral fellow at Dalhousie University (1967‚Äì68) before becoming an English professor in 1968, at the University of New Brunswick.  Career  While teaching at UNB, Cameron served as publisher and founding editor of The Mysterious East. During its four-year existence, the left-leaning, monthly magazine published a wide variety of articles and editorials on issues in Canada's Maritime Provinces, including everything from pollution, housing and censorship to birth control, drugs and the problems of native peoples. In 1971, Cameron took a leave of absence from UNB and moved to D'Escousse, a village on Isle Madame, a small island off the southeastern coast of Cape Breton. He wanted to write, he missed the sea and his first marriage had ended.McCulloch, Sandra. \\"HORIZONS - Freedom found at sea,\\" Times Colonist (Victoria), November 7, 1993. He arrived in Cape Breton, a divorced father of three sons and a daughter. As he told a journalist 20 years later, \\"Dr. Donald Cameron left his university office, drove to the village of D'Escousse, stepped into a phone booth and emerged as the award-winning author and playwright Silver Donald Cameron.\\"MacDonald, Cathy. \\"A silver lining: Silver Donald Cameron's book salutes Cape Breton's good life,\\" The Daily News (Halifax), October 21, 1991. (He added the name \\"Silver\\" to set himself apart from the multitudes of other Camerons. Folk- singer Tom Gallant suggested the name because Cameron's head of prematurely grey hair was his most striking feature.) Cameron also explains the origin of the name \\"Silver\\" in his sailing book Wind, Whales and Whisky, p. 72. Cameron settled in D'Escousse after buying a house he describes as \\"composed of two tiny ancient buildings pushed together to make one comfortable home.\\" He adds that the house was \\"spang on the roadside, the floor plan was awkward, and it was half-renovated in a style not much to my taste. But it felt right: a serene and happy little house where generations had loved and laughed and wept and died.\\"Cameron, Silver Donald. (1991) Wind, Whales and Whisky: A Cape Breton Voyage. Toronto, Macmillan Canada. Cameron had already published magazine articles and a literary book, Faces of Leacock, a 1967 study of the great Canadian humorist, but now he was finally free to begin his apprenticeship as a full-time writer. For him, D'Escousse was an ideal home base. \\"For a writer,\\" Cameron writes, \\"the great benefit of a village is the way you can know people.\\" He added that in cities, writers are inevitably drawn into limited circles, but villages let them escape. \\"My friends in D'Escousse include welders, fishermen, millwrights and mothers on welfare as well as teachers, potters, priests and businessmen.\\" Moreover, a writer who lives in a village watches people change and grow. \\"An electrician becomes a politician, schoolboys become truckers and contractors, middle-aged civil servants retire and old people take their departures. Knowing them year by year, I can grasp something of the flow of their lives.\\" In 1973, Cameron bought an unfinished boat named Hirondelle in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In the book Wind, Whales and Whisky, he writes about spending the summer completing it by adding masts, toilets, compasses and handrails before sailing the 33-foot schooner back to D'Escousse. Hirondelle became the first schooner moored in D'Escousse since 1928 when Leonard Pertus sold his own boat Maple Leaf. Pertus became Cameron's tutor and mentor teaching him how to sail safely and well. Cameron dreamed of sailing across the Atlantic and, with the help of friends, began a nine-year project building a 27-foot cutter named Silversark. Notable books =The Education of Everett Richardson= In 1977, Silver Donald Cameron published The Education of Everett Richardson: The Nova Scotia Fishermen's Strike 1970‚Äì71. Portions of the book had previously appeared in three Canadian magazines, Maclean's, Saturday Night and The Mysterious East.Cameron, Silver Donald. (1977) The Education of Everett Richardson: The Nova Scotia Fishermen's Strike 1970‚Äì71. Toronto: McClelland and Stewart. Everett Richardson was one of 235 trawlermen from the tiny ports of Canso, Mulgrave and Petit de Grat who fought for better pay, safer working conditions, job security and most of all, for the right to belong to the union they had chosen, the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union led by Homer Stevens, a member of the Communist Party of Canada. Their main adversaries were two, huge, foreign-owned fishing companies. The fishermen also faced stiff opposition from what Cameron calls the \\"cod aristocracy\\", rich members of the Nova Scotia elite, as well as from leading politicians, judges, government bureaucrats, members of the clergy, the province's main daily newspaper, and the Canadian labour establishment itself. \\"In the end,\\" Cameron writes, \\"this is not a story of the fishermen, or even of the labour movement. It is a story about privilege and poverty and injustice in this country, and about the social and political arrangements which cheat and oppress most Canadians, which stunt our humanity and distort our environment.\\" After a seven-month strike and many more months of struggle, the fishermen eventually lost the right to be represented by their chosen union. However, Cameron points out that they did win collective bargaining rights for fishermen in Nova Scotia breaking centuries-old rules that prohibited them from joining unions. The strike also brought better pay and working conditions. Cameron concludes that the fishermen were both \\"collective heroes and martyrs, who lost the battle for themselves but won it for their brothers.\\" He adds that the striking fishermen \\"changed the law, changed conditions on the boats, and left the see-saw of power balanced a little more evenly.\\" Shortly after the book was published, it received a hostile review in The Globe and Mail. Critic Patrick O'Flaherty complained that the book contributed to a Canadian literary atmosphere that \\"continues to stink of parlor radical sanctimoniousness.\\"O'Flaherty, Patrick. \\"The Education of Everett Richardson.\\" The Globe and Mail, August 20, 1977, p. 35. Two years later, critic Michael Greenstein praised the book for its even-handedness, but suggested Cameron got too bogged down in the official account of the strike and could have used more lively anecdotes to entertain his readers.Greenstein, Michael. \\"Down and Out Across Canada.\\" Canadian Literature No. 81, Summer, 1979, pp. 134‚Äì137. However, more than 30 years after its publication,The Education of Everett Richardson attained the rank of 47th in a volume listing Atlantic Canada's 100 Greatest Books. Authors Trevor Adams and Stephen Clare write: \\"Cameron takes readers to the strike's seminal moments, giving them a real sense of the people on both sides of the conflict, and showing a keen understanding of this pivotal moment in Canadian labour history.\\" They add that \\"through the lens of Atlantic Canadian history, or the labour movement, or the history of the fisheries, this is an important book. Yet few books on those subjects stand as large as The Education of Everett Richardson. That's because this book's ultimate strength is in Cameron's storytelling skills. His writing is taut, tense, and blunt, perfectly reflecting the powder-keg feel of the times.\\" =Wind, Whales and Whisky= Wind Whales and Whisky: A Cape Breton Voyage recounts Cameron's adventures as he, his wife Lulu and 12-year-old son Mark Patrick sail around Cape Breton Island on their 27-foot cutter Silversark during the summer of 1990. Cameron himself says the book is a family adventure, a portrait of Cape Breton and \\"an essay on values, what is it that makes a good life.\\" The book has also been described as \\"a wonderfully entertaining Bruegel painting of a book‚Äîat once a travelogue, a history, a geography, a folk study, a social commentary and a book of humour.\\"McDonell, James. \\"Joyful romp around Cape Breton,\\" The Ottawa Citizen, December 14, 1991, p. J5. Cameron introduces his readers to a wide variety of characters that he meets during his voyage including moonshine makers, malt-whisky distillers, musicians, poets, American Buddhists, fishermen and coal miners. Wind, Whales and Whisky uses the techniques of creative nonfiction blending facts, observations, quotes, dialogue, anecdotes and stories. On a cold day in July, for example, Cameron accompanies Fred Lawrence as he hauls his lobster traps between Money Point and Bay St. Lawrence on the northern tip of Cape Breton Island. The six-page account includes detailed descriptions of how fishermen retrieve, empty and bait their traps, how they determine which lobsters they can legally keep and how they band lobster foreclaws with \\"a thick, fat elastic\\" before dropping them into \\"a bin filled with circulating sea water.\\" The episode contains information on lobster biology including mating and feeding habits as well as what is known about their migrations. Cameron also describes how businessman John Risley discovered that lobsters \\"essentially go dormant in icy water\\" enabling his company to store them for up to a year by putting them into individual plastic trays stacked in \\"huge racks which reach clear to the ceilings of the cavernous holding rooms\\" and pumping 24,000 gallons of chilled sea-water per hour through the trays. \\"At that temperature\\", Cameron notes, \\"lobsters do not eat, grow or moult, but they retain their weight, their texture and their taste, drawing only on the nutrients in their blood.\\" He adds that Risley began airlifting his steady supply of lobsters to cities all over the world transforming his company from its beginnings \\"as a single roadside lobster stand\\" into \\"a corporate empire\\". The information about lobsters is interwoven with stories about the many shipwrecks on a nearby \\"killer island\\", how Fred Lawrence ended up moving to Cape Breton from Maine, and the dramatic traces that \\"ancient volcanoes, mighty glaciers, up-tilted seafloors\\" have left on the coastline. \\"The rocks have a tortured appearance\\", Cameron writes, \\"abrupt, sharp shapes, angled striations, rapid shifts of colour from pink to white, rust, green, grey, black. The geology looks like frozen violence: layers of rock bent, twisted, broken, folded, thrust upward, knocked sideways, pressed downward.\\" In Wind, Whales and Whisky, Cameron discusses one of the ironies he sees about life in Cape Breton. On the one hand, the island seems poor with chronic unemployment, but on the other, its rural inhabitants have access to abundant and delicious food such as apples, cranberries, fish, deer, moose and the produce from their gardens. After describing \\"the most unbelievably wonderful meal of the voyage\\"‚Äîlobster and grey sole baked in the oven with tinned mushroom soup accompanied by scalloped potatoes and broccoli, Cameron writes: \\"I love living in a depressed region, I thought. One lives so well.\\" In a chapter entitled, \\"Good People in Bad Times\\", Cameron outlines the troubles of industrial Cape Breton including the long decline of two of its economic mainstays, coal mining and steel making. \\"It is a hard place to make a living\\", he writes, \\"but it is a wonderful place to live.\\" > Industrial Cape Breton is raucous and funny, full of music and theatre and > satire. It is gossipy and anecdotal, tolerant of eccentricity, generous and > co-operative. It is tenacious, disorderly, skeptical of authority, lethal to > pomposity and pretension. It is fecund, unruly and affectionate. Newspaper reviewers praised Wind, Whales and Whisky as entertaining, joyful and informative. One, who grew up on Cape Breton Island, wrote that the book brought back many memories: \\"I could smell the salt and feel the warmth of those country kitchens and hear the intoxicating song of the fiddle ... There are moonshiners and poets in this book, fishermen and ghosts, Buddhist monks and singing coal miners, cock-fighters and priests. There's also a pretty good recipe for moonshine you could try if you're willing to risk $500 in fines and maybe six months in jail.\\"Waters, Paul. \\"Cape Breton voyage a tale full of monks, moonshine and music\\". The Gazette (Montreal), October 19, 1991, p. 13.  Awards and recognition  His writing and journalism earned him numerous awards including the Evelyn Richardson Award, the Atlantic Provinces Booksellers Award and the City of Dartmouth Book Award. One of his television dramas won a Best Short Film award and he earned four National Magazine Awards as well as two awards for his corporate writing. In 2012, Cameron received both the Order of Canada and the Order of Nova Scotia.  Personal life  Cameron wrote about the Terrios, a large family in D'Escousse. One of the Terrio daughters, Marie Louise \\"Lulu\\" Terrio, had gone to Denmark the year before he moved to the village to study biochemistry at the University of Copenhagen. She became an ardent sailor in Denmark, married a Dane and gave birth to a son named Mark Patrick. When her marriage ended, she moved back to D'Escousse with her son and, \\"nervous as a schoolboy,\\" Cameron asked her to help him sail his schooner to Louisbourg, Cape Breton in 1979. He writes that he fell \\"hopelessly in love with her\\" when she asked him to take the tiller, vomited over the side, \\"wiped her mouth, climbed back to the afterdeck and reached for the tiller.\\" They were married in May 1980 in D'Escousse and 10 years later sailed around Cape Breton Island in Silversark, a voyage recounted in Wind, Whales and Whisky. Lulu Terrio-Cameron died of breast cancer in April 1996. \\"We had 16 years of blissful happiness\\", Cameron told a journalist adding \\"it was the kind of marriage that every day I felt myself filled with wonder that I had such a person to share my life with. Every day I said a little prayer of thanks.\\"Swick, David. \\"Meaningful tributes honor a memorable woman.\\" The Daily News (Halifax), August 28, 1996, p. 2. Cameron was married to the writer Marjorie Simmins and was the father of five children from two previous marriages. He divided his time between Halifax and D'Escousse, Cape Breton. Cameron died in a Halifax hospital on June 1, 2020, after being diagnosed with lung cancer. His death came just a few weeks before his latest non-fiction book Blood in the Water: A True Story of Revenge in the Maritimes was due to be released. The book describes the circumstances around the murder of a small-time criminal who had been terrorizing the small Cape Breton community of Petit-de-Grat for many years.

Life and career Frederic was born in Utica, New York, to Presbyterian parents. After his father was killed in a railroad accident when Frederic was 18 months old, the boy was raised primarily by his mother. He finished school at age fifteen, and soon began work as a photographer. For four years he was a photographic touch-up artist in his hometown and in Boston. In 1875, he began work as a proofreader for the newspaper The Utica Herald and then The Utica Daily Observer. Frederic later became a reporter. Frederic married Grace Green Williams in 1877, and they had five children together. By 1882 he was editor of the newspaper The Albany Evening Journal in the state capital. In 1884 Frederic went to live in England as London correspondent of the New York Times, and worked at this position for the rest of his life. He brought his family to London by 1889. Afterward he met Kate Lyon, who became his mistress. Frederic and Lyon established a second household, living openly together; and they had three illegitimate children. Frederic wrote several early stories, but it was not until he published Illumination (1896), better known by its American title, The Damnation of Theron Ware, followed by Gloria Mundi (1898), that his talent as a novelist was fully realized. Critic Jonathan Yardley called Damnation \\"a minor classic of realism\\".Yardley, Jonathan. (November 27, 2006.) \\"In 'Theron Ware,' Realism Wears Well\\", The Washington Post.

Nicknamed \\"Multicoloured Tiger\\", he ranks 50th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 14th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Yan Shun, who is nicknamed \\"Multicoloured Tiger\\", has reddish brown hair, a yellowish beard, round eyes, long arms, and a wide waist. He fights well, especially with sabre. Initially a trader from Laizhou (ËêäÂ∑û; around present-day Yantai, Shandong), he forms a bandit gang at Mount Qingfeng (Ê∏ÖÈ¢®Â±±; in present-day Qingzhou, Shandong). He is subsequently assisted by Wang Ying and Zheng Tianshou. Meeting Song Jiang When Song Jiang, on the run from the law after killing his mistress Yan Poxi, is going to Qingfeng Fort (Ê∏ÖÈ¢®ÂØ®; near Mount Qingfeng) to take shelter under his friend Hua Rong, he comes by Mount Qingfeng and is captured in a trap by the bandits. They intend to kill him and use his heart to make soup. Just as he is about to be sliced up, Song sighs loudly, \\"Am I, Song Jiang, destined to die just like this?\\" Surprised to hear the name of a person he admires for chivalry, Yan Shun interrupts in time to inquire. After confirming Song's identity, the three bandit chiefs quickly free him, apologise to him and treat him as an honoured guest. As they drink, Wang Ying, who desires pretty women, goes to intercept a group crossing Mount Qingfeng that consists of a sedan chair, which apparently carries a female. Finding the woman attractive, Wang wants to rape her. When the woman says she is the wife of Liu Gao, the governor of Qingfeng Fort, Song Jiang feels obliged to persuade Wang to let her go as Liu is the colleague of Hua Rong, the fort's garrison commandant. Yan Shun agrees with him and pressures Wang to comply. Wang reluctantly agrees. Joining Liangshan On the Lantern Festival night, Song Jiang, who is then living in Hua Rong's house, goes outdoor to enjoy the celebrations. Liu Gao's wife spots him and lies to her husband that Song has abducted her at Mount Qingfeng and tried to rape her. Believing his wife, Liu orders Song arrested. After Hua Rong saved Song by force, Liu seeks help from Murong Yanda, the governor of Qingzhou, which oversees Qingfeng Fort. Huang Xin, who is sent to handle the matter, lures Hua to a feast and captures him. Meanwhile, Liu has seized Song again as he tried to sneak to Mount Qingfeng. When Huang Xin is taking Song Jiang and Hua Rong back to Qingzhou, the bandits of Mount Qingfeng, led by Yan Shun, waylay the escort party, rescue the two prisoners and kill Liu Gao. The bandits later defeat an army sent from Qingzhou led by Qin Ming and seize Mrs Liu after breaking into Qingfeng Fort. Wang Ying again intends to keep Mrs Liu for himself. But he is prevented by Song, who believes she would ruin Wang. Yan Shun, in agreement with Song, decisively draws a sabre and kills the woman. He nearly has an armed fight with Wang, who is placated only after Song promised to find him a pretty and virtuous wife. As Qingzhou is likely to send a larger force to exterminate them, Song suggests that the group decamp to join Liangshan Marsh. Yan is thus absorbed into the larger band. Campaigns and death Yan Shun is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. In the battle of Black Dragon Ridge (ÁÉèÈæçÂ∂∫; northeast of present-day Meicheng Town, Jiande, Zhejiang) in the campaign against Fang La, Yan Shun faces Shi Bao, one of Fang's better warriors who fights with a spiked mace. After Ma Lin was killed by Shi, Yan is eager to avenge his comrade but is fatally smashed by the mace wielder and dies.

Whilst Bah√° º√≠ scripture asserts that true science and true religion can never be in conflict, critics argue that statements by the founders clearly contradict current scientific understanding.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, stated that \\"when a religion is opposed to science it becomes mere superstition\\". He also said that true religion must conform to the conclusions of science. This latter aspect of the principle seems to suggest that the religion must always accept current scientific knowledge as authoritative, but some Bah√° º√≠ scholars have suggested that this is not always the case.\\"It also requires us not to limit science to any particular school of thought or methodological approach postulated in the course of its development.\\" in On some issues, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith subordinates the conclusions of current scientific thought to its own teachings, which the religion takes as fundamentally true. This is because, in the Bah√° º√≠ understanding the present scientific view is not always correct, neither is truth said to be only limited to what science can explain. Instead, in the Bah√° º√≠ view, knowledge must be obtained through the interaction of the insights obtained from revelation from God and through scientific investigation. Harmony between science and religion  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, asserted that science and religion cannot be opposed because they are aspects of the same truth; he also affirmed that reasoning powers are required to understand the truths of religion. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the first half of the 20th century, described science and religion as \\"the two most potent forces in human life\\". The teachings state that whenever conflict arises between religion and science it is due to human error; either through misinterpretation of religious scriptures or the lack of a more complete understanding of science.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° explained that religious teachings which are at variance with science should not be accepted; he explained that religion has to be reasonable since God endowed humankind with reason so that they can discover truth. Science and religion, in the Bah√° º√≠ writings, are compared to the two wings of a bird upon which a person's intelligence can increase, and upon which a person's soul can progress. Furthermore, the Bah√° º√≠ writings state that science without religion would lead to a person becoming totally materialistic, and religion without science would lead to a person falling into superstitious practices.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in one of his public talks said: Attitude toward science  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° is quoted as saying this: Scientific claims by the founders =Creation= Bah√° ºu'll√°h taught that the universe has \\"neither beginning nor ending\\", and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will continue to exist. In the Tablet of Wisdom (\\"Lawh-i-Hikmat\\", written 1873-1874). Bah√° ºu'll√°h states: \\"That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form thou seest today. The world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different.\\" The terminology used here refers to ancient Greek and Islamic philosophy. Jean-Marc Lepain, Robin Mihrshahi, Dale E. Lehman and Julio Savi suggest a possible relation of this statement with the Big Bang theory.Lepain, Jean-Marc (2015) [2002]. The Archeology of the Kingdom of God.Lehman, Dale E. (2005). Cosmology and the Bah√° º√≠ Writings . Bah√° º√≠s believe that the story of creation in Genesis is a rudimentary account that conveys the broad essential spiritual truths of existence without a level of detail and accuracy that was unnecessary and incomprehensible at the time. Likewise,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° said that literal story of Adam and Eve cannot be accepted, affirmed, or imagined, and that it \\"must be thought of simply as a symbol\\". And rather than accepting the idea of a Young Earth, Bah√° º√≠ theology accepts that the Earth is ancient. =Evolution= Charles Darwin, the famous 19th-century English naturalist who proposed a naturalistic mechanism for evolution. In regards to evolution and the origin of man,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these talks can be found in Some Answered Questions, Paris Talks and the Promulgation of Universal Peace.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° describes the human species as evolving from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s comments seem to differ from the standard evolutionary picture of human development, where Homo sapiens as one species along with the great apes evolved from a common ancestor living in Africa millions of years ago. While  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° states that man progressed through many stages before reaching this present form,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° states that humans are a distinct species, and not an animal, and that in every stage of evolution through which humans progressed, they were potentially humans. Mehanian and Friberg wrote a 2003 article describing their belief that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s statements can be entirely reconciled with modern science. Mehanian and Friberg state that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s departures from the conventional interpretation of evolution are likely due \\"to disagreements with the metaphysical, philosophical, and ideological aspects of those interpretations, not with scientific findings.\\" And to this end  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° suggested that a missing link between human and apes would not be found. The idea of a missing link per se was abandoned by science in favor of the idea of evolutionary transitions. There are some differences between  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s statements and current scientific thought. The Bah√° º√≠ perspective that religion must be in accordance with science seems to suggest that religion must accept current scientific knowledge as authoritative; but, according to Mehanian and Friberg, this is not necessarily always the case as in their view the present scientific point of view is not always correct, nor truth only limited to what science can explain. Oskooi chose the subject of evolution and Bah√° º√≠ belief for his 2009 thesis, and in doing so reviewed other Bah√° º√≠ authors' works on the subject. He concluded that, \\"The problem of disharmony between scripture and science is rooted in an unwarranted misattribution of scriptural inerrancy.\\" In other words, he believes that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° made statements about biology that were later proved wrong, and that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s infallibility should not be applied to scientific matters. Several authors have written on the subject of evolution and Bah√° º√≠ belief. *Craig Loehle (1990), On Human Origins: A Bah√° º√≠ Perspective *Eberhard von Kitzing (1997), Is the Bah√° º√≠ view of evolution compatible with modern science? *Courosh Mehanian and Stephan Friberg (2003), Religion and Evolution Reconciled:  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Comments on Evolution *Bahman Nadimi, Do the Baha ºi Writings on evolution allow for mutation of species within kingdoms but not across kingdoms? *Keven Brown (2001), Evolution and Bah√° º√≠ Belief:  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Response to Nineteenth-Century Darwinism *Fariborz Alan Davoodi, MD, Human Evolution: Directed? *Salman Oskooi (2009), When Science and Religion Merge: A Modern Case Study =Existence of ether= The luminiferous aether: it was hypothesised that the Earth moves through a \\"medium\\" of aether that carries light Aether, or ether, was a substance postulated in the late 19th century to be the medium for the propagation of light. The Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment of 1887 made an effort to find the aether, but its failure to detect it led Einstein to devise his Special theory of Relativity. Further developments in modern physics, including general relativity, quantum field theory, and string theory all incorporate the non-existence of the aether, and today the concept is considered obsolete scientific theory.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s use of the aether concept in one of his talks - his audience including scientists of the time - has been the source of some controversy. The chapter in  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Some Answered Questions which mentions aether differentiates between things that are \\"perceptible to the senses\\" and those which are \\"realities of the intellect\\" and not perceptible to the senses.Letter to an individual by the Universal House of Justice  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° includes \\"ethereal matter\\" (also translated as \\"etheric matter\\"), heat, light and electricity among other things, in the second group of things which are not perceptible to the senses, and are concepts which are arrived at intellectually to explain certain phenomena. The Universal House of Justice referring to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s use of the word state that, \\"in due course, when scientists failed to confirm the physical existence of the 'ether' by delicate experiments, they constructed other intellectual concepts to explain the same phenomena\\" which is consistent with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s categorization of aether. Robin Mishrahi in his published paper on the issue titled \\"Ether, Quantum Physics and the Bah√° º√≠ Writings\\" wrote, =Nuclear power= Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote: Bah√° º√≠s later pointed to this as a statement about the discovery of nuclear energy and the use of nuclear weapons. =Transmutation of elements= In 1873 Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote: =Life on other planets= Kepler Space Telescope - a NASA telescope that is capable of detecting extrasolar terrestrial planets. Bah√° ºu'll√°h stated: The idea that every planet has \\"its own creatures\\" is controversial. While no direct evidence has been found of extraterrestrial life, theories range from the Rare Earth hypothesis, that the earth may be unique in hosting life, to the more common idea that it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere other than Earth. Very few Bah√° º√≠ sources deal with this idea in detail.

Heller was one of the major Talmudic scholars in Prague and in Poland during the \\"Golden Age\\" before 1648. Education and rabbinic career After Heller was born in Wallerstein, Bavaria, he was raised by his grandfather, Rabbi Moses Ha-Levi Heller, as his father died at the age of 18 before he was even born.Introduction of Rabbi Heller to his work Lechem Chamudos As a teenager Heller was sent to Friedberg, near Wallerstein, where he studied in the Yeshiva of Rabbi Jacob G√ºnzburg. From there he moved to Prague, where he became a disciple of the Maharal, head of the yeshiva of Prague. In 1597, when Heller was scarcely 18 years old, he received a Semicha (appointment) as a Dayan (rabbinic judge) in that city. In October 1624 Heller was called to the rabbinate of Mikulov, Moravia, and in March 1625, became rabbi of Vienna. Leopoldstadt was then a suburb of Vienna. When he arrived, the Jews of Vienna were scattered throughout the city, not having a central community. Heller obtained the right for the Jews to establish a central Jewish community in Leopoldstadt. He was instrumental in reorganizing the community and drew up its constitution. From 1627 until 1629, he was Chief Rabbi of Prague. In 1631, he moved to Ukraine, where he served as rabbi of Nemirov for three years. In 1634, he moved to the larger city of Ludmir (Volodymyr) in Volhynia. During his years in Volhynia and Poland, Heller was among the rabbinic leaders of the Council of Four Lands. In 1640, he worked to obtain the renewal of the synod‚Äôs decrees against simony in the rabbinate. Finally, in 1643 he was elected head of the rabbinical court of Krak√≥w, one of the two chief rabbis of that community. Rabbi Yehoshua Heschel of Crakow, the author of Maginei Shelomo, was head of the Yeshiva there. Four years later, Heschel died, and Heller succeeded him and also directed the Yeshiva as well. Heller was chief rabbi of Krak√≥w during the Chmielnicki uprising of 1648, and until his death in 1654. Imprisonment In the summer of 1629, Heller was arrested at the order of the imperial court of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. Heller was accused of insulting Christianity and imprisoned in Vienna. A commission was quickly appointed to inquire into Heller's guilt. He defended himself adroitly, but the commission's verdict was that Heller be sentenced to death. After intervention,See Addition to Megilas Eiva from Rabbi Shmuel Heller son of Rabbi Yom Tov, who describes the way he was able to have a French minister intercede on his Father's behalf. It is interesting that Rabbi Heller himself makes no reference to this. Perhaps Rabbi Heller felt that this was just God's way of helping him. He did not want his salvation to be thought of as coincidence. the king agreed to impose a fine of 12,000 thalers instead. After negotiations it was reduced to 10,000 thalers (still a huge sum).Megilas Eivah authored by Rabbi Heller chronicles in detail the events of his imprisonment Afterwards the King declared that Rabbi Heller could no longer serve as a Rabbi. After spending more than a month in prison, Rabbi Heller was released. He then spent two years paying off the fine. In 1631, Heller left Prague and spent the second part of his career in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Several factors account for Heller's imprisonment. His arrest marked the beginning of a brief Habsburg anti-Jewish campaign, encouraged by the Papacy. Heller also had enemies within the Prague Jewish community. On account of the Thirty Years' War, the government had imposed heavy taxes on the Jewish communities of Bohemia, including that of Prague, which had to pay a yearly tax of 40,000 thalers. A commission headed by Chief Rabbi Heller unanimously voted to tax each Jewish family in Prague. The richer the family, the higher the tax. The burden fell mostly upon the rich merchants who could well afford to pay their assessments. However, they complained and demanded a reexamination of the decision. Rabbi Heller and his committee reviewed the problem and concluded that this approach was fair. The committee met with representatives of the merchants' association to explain the sensitive situation facing the Jewish community of Prague. The irate merchants refused to deal with the Qahal which was responsible for delivering the money to the government. Instead, they decided to appeal to the government. In their petition they charged the Chief Rabbi with being an enemy of Christianity. Their proof: \\"His writings are filled with allegations against the religion of the country.\\" Rabbi Heller was associated with the wealthy leader of the Prague community at that time, Jacob Bassevi. He was an ally of the great general Albrecht von Wallenstein, who also had enemies at the Habsburg court. Heller's relationship with Bassevi and Heller's arrest played a part in larger political machinations there. Family Yom-Tov Heller founded a long line of rabbis. His father, Nathan, who died days before he was born, was the son of Rabbi Moses. Heller was married to Rachel, a daughter of a wealthy Prague merchant, Aaron Moses Ashkenazi (Munk). Through his wife he was related to the Horowitz family. On his mother's side, he was related to the G√ºnzburg family; on his father's side, to the Frankel family of Vienna. Despite his father dying at age 18, Yom-Tov is believed to have had three siblings: brother Joseph d. 1659, sister Perel and another unknown sister. It is possible but unclear whether the addition of Oettingen and Wallerstein to their names means his ancestors had connections by marriage with the noble families of the House of Oettingen-Wallerstein. Yom-Tov and Rachel probably had 16 children, at least six sons and at least eight daughters. Sons whom he mentions in his works, were: Moses of Prague, Samuel of Nemirow (now Nemirov, Ukraine), Abraham of Lublin (now in Poland), and Leb of Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus). The daughters of whom we definitely know were: Nechle, Nisel, Doberish, Esther, Rebecca, and Reizel. Probably his most famous descendant was Aryeh Leib Heller (b. 1745), known as the K'tzos (after his greatest work, K'tzos Hachoshen). His brother Yehuda Heller Kahana (b. 1738), known as the Kuntras Ha'Sfeikos, often appeared with the K'tzos Hachoshen. Other noted relatives are Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport (b. 1790), religious scholar, poet, writer whose grandson, Arnold Edler von Porada Rapoport (b. 1840) was a lawyer, parliamentarian, coal mining entrepreneur, and philanthropist. In commemoration of his imprisonment and his release from prison, Heller established two special days of remembrance for his family and descendants. He established the 5th of Tammuz, the day on which his troubles began, as an annual fast-day, and the 1st of Adar as a day of celebration on the anniversary of his nomination to the rabbinate of Krak√≥w. The reading of the Megillah that Heller wrote, called Megilat Eivah (Scroll of Hostility), that tells the story of his imprisonment and release, became a tradition for the descendants of Rabbi Heller. To this day, they celebrate the story of his life in a special Purim celebration. In 1984 on the 330th anniversary Yahrzeit of Rabbi Heller's death his autobiographical story of his imprisonment Megillat Eivah and a detailed family tree were published in English by Rabbi C.U. Lipschitz and Dr. Neil Rosenstein under the title, The Feast and The Fast by Moznaim Publishing Corporation, New York and Jerusalem. The book contains 40 pages of charts detailing the family tree and the hundreds of families descended from Rabbi Heller. Works and opinions Between 1614 and 1617 Rabbi Heller published a Mishnah commentary, in three volumes. It was initially entitled Tosefet Yom Tov,The name Tosefet Yom Tov is visible in the title page and forward of the 3rd printing here and in the Hebrew National Library catalog. Later on, in some volumes of the Vilna Romm Edition of the Mishna (such as and volume of Moed), the printers \\"forgot\\" to change the name from the original \\"Tosefet\\". but is now often referred to by the erroneous name Tosafot Yom Tov. The commentary quickly became established as one of the standard commentaries to the Mishnah, and is studied to this day. His commentary is an important complement to the commentary of Bartenura (Tosefet [addition] to Bartenura ‚Äì hence the title.◊¢◊ú ◊õ◊ü ◊®◊ê◊ô◊™◊ô ◊õ◊ô ◊†◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊ú◊ß◊®◊ï◊ê ◊ó◊ë◊ï◊® ◊ñ◊î ◊ë◊©◊ù ◊™◊ï◊°◊§◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊ò◊ï◊ë ◊¢◊ú ◊©◊ù ◊î◊§◊ï◊¢◊ú ◊ï◊î◊§◊¢◊ï◊ú ◊õ◊ô ◊ñ◊î ◊†◊ï◊©◊ê◊ï ◊©◊î◊ï◊°◊ô◊£ ◊ë◊ô◊ê◊ï◊® ◊¢◊ú ◊ë◊ô◊ê◊ï◊® ◊î◊®◊¢\\"◊ë ◊ñ\\"◊ú. ) Heller's major halakhic work was Ma'adanei Yom Tov, a commentary to the summary of the Babylonian Talmud by Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel. Rabbi Asher's summary was often taken by German Jews of Heller's day to be the most authoritative statement of Jewish law, even in preference to the Shulchan Aruch. Heller's introduction to the work endorses that view. Heller's halakhic views, mainly on matters of ritual, are quoted by many later rabbis, especially those of Prague. Among Heller's many minor works are sermons and responsa. He also wrote two sets of piyyutim. The first set from 1621, commemorates the Defenestration of Prague and the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, and the escape of the Prague Jews from the sack of Prague by Habsburg troops after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. The second set of poems, written in 1650, commemorate the Cossack massacres of 1648-1649. Heller was a kabbalist, and even wrote a kabbalistic work, a commentary on Rabbenu Bahya ben Asher, based on the kabbalistic views of Moses Cordovero. But throughout most of his life, Heller was opposed to the popularization of the kabbalah, and the use of kabbalistic reasoning in matters of Jewish law. Among rabbis of his generation, Heller was exceptionally well versed in the secular sciences. His Talmudic works and his sermons show that he was interested in questions of arithmetic, astronomy, and natural science. His notes on the Giv'at haMorehAvailable on HebrewBooks at https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/24777, which is itself a commentary on Maimonides' work Moreh Nevuchim written by one of his teachers Joseph ben Isaac ha-Levi, prove he occupied himself with philosophy. He praised the Me'or Einayim of Azariah dei Rossi in spite of the anathema that his master, Judah ben Bezalel, whom he held in great esteem, had launched against the book and its author. His statement on the universal dignity of humanity is also notable, as is his openness to study of works by non-Jews. One of his sermons alludes to the new astronomy of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. Folktales and fictions Since 1881, Heller's Megilat Eivah has typically been published with a second section that is attributed to his son Samuel. Samuel relates the story of Heller's imprisonment and trial from his own point of view. In his version, the Rabbi was helped by the French general Turenne, ambassador of the court of King Louis XIV of France, after Samuel's dramatic life-saving of Turenne's wife and daughter at a park in Vienna, when they were attacked by a raging bull. The anecdote is based on a story by Ludwig Philippson. Benish Ashkenazi, one of the major characters in the novel Satan in Goray by Isaac Bashevis Singer, is a fictionalized version of Rabbi Heller. Grave of Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller in Remah Cemetery, Krakow Heller is also the subject of a number of folktales and legends. One well-known story about him concerns Yossele the Holy Miser, who died in Krak√≥w. Rabbi Heller was asked where to bury him. The town leaders were disgusted by the man's lack of charity, and directed that his body be buried in a far corner of the cemetery. A few days after the miser's death, a great cry was heard in the town, for the poor and hungry were bereft of the miser's secret generosity. The \\"miser\\" had been giving charity in the most noble fashion ‚Äì secretly giving money to the local merchants, who in turn had given food, clothing and money to the poor. When this came to Rabbi Heller's attention, he was visibly shaken. He instructed the town to bury him next to Yossele upon his own death. This explains why Rabbi Heller, one of the greatest of Talmudic scholars, is buried in such an undistinguished section of the cemetery.

Nicknamed \\"Fair-skinned Gentleman\\", he ranks 74th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 38th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Nicknamed \\"Fair-skinned Gentleman\\", Zheng Tianshou is depicted as good-looking with a fair complexion, a lean build and broad shoulders. He is skilled in martial arts. Originally from Suzhou, he spends most of his younger days wandering around the Song Empire. One day, when he passes by Mount Qingfeng (Ê∏ÖÈ¢®Â±±; in present-day Qingzhou, Shandong), a group of bandits led by Wang Ying set upon him to rob him. Zheng fights Wang to a standstill. Impressed with his fighting skill, Yan Shun, the chief of the bandits, invites him to join his band. Zheng gladly agrees and takes the third position after Yan and Wang. Meeting Song Jiang When Song Jiang, on the run to escape arrest after killing his mistress Yan Poxi, is heading to Qingfeng Fort (Ê∏ÖÈ¢®ÂØ®; near Mount Qingfeng) to take shelter under his friend Hua Rong, he passes by Mount Qingfeng and is captured in a trap by the bandits. They want to kill him and use his heart to make soup. Just as Song is about to be sliced up, he sighs loudly, \\"Am I, Song Jiang, destined to die just like this?\\" Yan Shun is surprised to hear the name of a man he admires for chivalry. and stops the killing in time. After Song confirmed his identity, the three bandit chiefs release him, apologise to him, and treat him as an honoured guest. While at the stronghold, Song Jiang saves a woman from being raped by Wang Ying, who has abducted her as she was crossing the hill with her servants. Learning that the woman is the wife of Liu Gao, the governor of Qingfeng Fort and thus the superior of Hua Rong, who is the fort's military commandant, he persuades Wang to let her go. Wang reluctantly agrees. Joining Liangshan One festive night, Song Jiang, then staying at Hua Rong's house, goes outdoor to watch the celebrations. The wife of Liu Gao spots him and lies to her husband that Song had abducted her at Mount Qingfeng and nearly raped her. Liu Gao believes his wife and arrests Song. Hua Rong, who rescued Song Jiang but could not prevent his being seized again by Liu Gao, is by and by also arrested himself. Both are being escorted to the prefecture office of Qingzhou, which oversees Qingfeng Fort. Yan Shun, Wang Ying and Zheng Tianshou intercept the convoy, together defeat the escort leader Huang Xin and rescue them. Later, the bandits, under the leadership of Song and Hua, fight a battle with Qin Ming, a commander sent from Qingzhou to eliminate them. Initially cold to Song's invitation to join the band, Qin is eventually won over following a plot by Song. Afraid that Qingzhou would send a larger force, Song Jiang suggests the group decamp to join the bandits of Liangshan Marsh. Thus Zheng Tianshou is absorbed into Liangshan. Campaigns and death Zheng Tianshou is appointed as one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the \\"Grand Assembly\\". He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Zheng Tianshou is killed in the battle of Muzhou (Áù¶Â∑û; in present- day Hangzhou, Zhejiang) in the campaign against Fang La when he is hit by an enemy projectile.

He was a member of the Ottonian dynasty, the only son of Duke Liudolf of Swabia and his wife Ida, and thus a grandson of the Emperor Otto I and his Anglo-Saxon wife Eadgyth. His sister Mathilde was the abbess of Essen Abbey. Otto was only three years old when his father died in 957. He was raised at the court of his grandfather, Otto I, who seems to have adopted him and raised him alongside his own son, the future Emperor Otto II, born late in 955. The latter regarded him as both \\"nephew and brother\\" (nepos ac frater). When the childless Duke Burchard III of Swabia died in 973, Otto II transferred the Swabian duchy to his nineteen-year-old nephew and brother, whose father had been Burchard's predecessor. The elder Otto became a close confidante of his younger sovereign. In 976 the imprisoned Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria was formally dismissed from office for rebellion. In his place the emperor appointed Otto of Swabia, who became the first ruler of two duchies in medieval Germany. The Duchy of Carinthia and the March of the Nordgau were also taken from Henry, but were not bestowed on Otto, thus their history is separate from that of Bavaria from this point on. In 977, while the emperor was campaigning elsewhere, Otto helped crush the revolt of the Three Henries‚Äîthe deposed duke of Bavaria, Bishop Henry I of Augsburg and Duke Henry I of Carinthia‚Äîby successfully besieging the leaders in Passau. The army of Bavarians that was ambushed by Boleslaus I of Bohemia near Plze≈à while on its way to join the emperor at this time may have been sent by Duke Otto. In 980 Otto accompanied the emperor on his south Italian campaign, fighting both the Byzantines and the Sicilian Arabs. He survived the defeat near Crotone on 13/14 July 982 and a subsequent ambush by an Arab force. Assigned to take the news of the campaign back to Germany, he died en route, of wounds received in battle, either 31 October or 1 November, at Lucca. His father had also died south of the Alps. His family brought his body back and had it buried in the collegiate church of Saints Peter and Alexander at Aschaffenburg, which Otto had generously endowed. His death is noted in the contemporary Abingdon version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: \\"And then, as he went home, his [the emperor's] brother's son, who was called Otto, died; and he was the son of the aetheling Liudolf, and this Liudolf was son of Otto the Elder and King Edward's daughter\\". Otto's sister Mathilde endowed a precious crux gemmata (jewelled cross), the Cross of Otto and Mathilde, which is kept in the Essen Cathedral Treasury; the siblings are pictured on it. Otto never married and left no children.

He was born on Devonshire Street North in Cork's north inner city. His father Michael, a former quartermaster sergeant in the Free State army, worked in Ford's motor plant ‚Äì the family originated in Conna in east County Cork where they had a medium-sized farm. Jim Lane's mother, Mary Ann (n√©e Lane), was in Cumann na Cailini and Cumann na mBan, the girl's and women's sections respectively of the Republican Movement, from childhood until 1935. In 1954, Jim Lane joined the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Sinn F√©in and the Cork Volunteers' Pipe Band. He subsequently actively participated in the IRA's 1956‚Äì62 border campaign. He was one of the first group of volunteers sent north for the campaign. However, when the Cork brigade of the IRA disengaged from the armed campaign, he resigned, along with a number of other Cork volunteers, such as his close friends Brendan O'Neill and Charlie Ronayne, and they continued to participate in the border campaign as unaligned volunteers. He was also involved with the Unemployed Protest Movement in the late 1950s\\"Lane to stand for H-Block\\",(Profile of Jim Lane) Southern Star,13 February 1982 p. 21. and was instrumental in establishing the Cork Vietnamese Freedom Association in the 1960s. Irish Protests Against Vietnam War Discussion of Irish anti-Vietnam War activists (including Lane) from Politics.ie An active trade unionist, he was a socialist republican from an early stage and was much influenced by Maoism in the 1960s and early 1970s. Lane was a leading figure in the republican 'splinter group', the Irish Revolutionary Forces throughout the 1960s.The Starry Plough-Introduction to reprint of Lane's \\"The Road to Revolution in Ireland\\" This Cork-based group, which comprised a large number of left-wing former IRA members, produced an influential newsletter in the early to mid-1960s called An Phoblacht (The Republic). This paper openly criticised the Republican Movement for its lack of action on the north and for reneging on republican principles. There was considerable tension between the IRF and the IRA, which turned into raids and armed counter-raids. In 1963, for example, a group of eight armed IRF members raided the Cork Sinn F√©in headquarters and warned the city's IRA leaders at gunpoint because of the IRA's seizure of the group's newsletter from the printer where it was being produced. The group also seized thousands of copies of the United Irishman, the Sinn F√©in paper, as it arrived in the local railway station. Relations between the group and the IRA were strained for much of the 1960s with the IRF regularly criticising the politics of the Republican Movement and arguing for a socialist way forward. The IRF group established Saor √âire in 1968 and produced a paper called People's Voice. The Lost Revolution by Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, Penguin Ireland, 2009 (pg.117); The IRA, 1956‚Äì69: Rethinking the Republic by Matt Treacy (Manchester University Press, 2011). Jim Lane was a leading figure in this group, as was Se√°n Daly (a former IRA commander) who was later to write books on Irish labour history. Lane and his comrades brought guns and assistance to Derry in 1969 when the Bogside was under siege (see Battle of the Bogside. Despite his membership of Saor √âire, he was briefly the intelligence officer for D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill's command area around County Londonderry/County Donegal at the time of the disturbances. Saor √âire was essentially a political group, but the name of the organisation was forever connected with militarism following a number of bank raids in the Dublin area in late 1969 by an unconnected republican splinter group that termed itself the Saor √âire Action Group. Also, the rise of the Provisionals fatally undermined Saor √âire's attempt to build a Marxist socialist-republican alternative to the official Republican Movement. The group disappeared at the beginning of the 1970s. The Cork branch of Saor √âire joined with the Irish Communist Organisation,and ran a bookshop at 9 St Nicholas Church Lane; a second unconnected Maoist bookshop was also opened in the Shandon Street area but this was closed down following attacks by local people.\\"Communist Bookshop Damaged\\",Irish Times, 17 March 1970.

The CCO later became the Cork Workers' Club. This operated out of the same premises in St Nicholas Church Lane that Saor √âire had used as its headquarters. Over the years, the CWC ran a bookshop selling Marxist and republican literature, and published a series of 'Historical Reprints' of Irish socialist classics by James Connolly, James Larkin and Ralph Fox.\\"Political Culture in Ireland\\" by Roy Johnston in Books Ireland,Feb. 1977, discusses the CWC's output. Lane also edited the book The Burning of Cork City by British Forces,Dec. 1920 in 1978. Jim Lane was central to the anti-H-Block movement in the Cork region at the end of the 1970s and became the chairperson of the Cork City and County National H-Block Committee, which organised many large demonstrations in support of the H-Block hunger strikers in 1980-1. He also joined the Irish Republican Socialist Party and became its national chairperson in 1983, a position he held for a number of years.

The island was settled by France as part of its colony of √éle-Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island). It is presumed to have been named for Madame de Maintenon, the second wife of France's King Louis XIV. After the fall of Louisbourg in 1758, 4,000 inhabitants were deported. However, a group of ten Acadian families from Port-Toulouse fled to this Isle Madame where their descendants still live today. Following the Seven Years' War, √éle-Royale and its constituent territories such as Isle Madame, reverted to British control.

Lema√©ac p. 324 Measuring 16 km long and 11 km wide, giving approximately 45 km2, Isle Madame is jurisdictionally part of Richmond County and is separated from Cape Breton Island by a narrow strait named Lennox Passage. Initially, the strait was crossed by ferries. The first swing bridge crossing Lennox Passage to connect with Isle Madame was constructed beginning in 1916, and opened in 1919. The Grandique Ferry service also crossed the passage between Martinique and Louisdale. In 1970, following the grounding and subsequent breakup of the Liberian tanker Arrow in Chedabucto Bay spilling her cargo of heavy bunker C oil, the Government of Nova Scotia built a causeway between Burnt Point and Burnt Island to prevent the spilled oil from further damaging the fishing area of the Passage. Following the oil spill cleanup in the early 1970s, the old bridge was demolished and the ferry service was terminated after a new combined causeway and single-leaf bascule bridge (the Burnt Island Bridge) was built across Lennox Passage. Isle Madame is also connected by bridge to neighbouring Petit- de-Grat Island, and by causeway and bridge to Janvrin Island.

PSR B1913+16 (also known as PSR J1915+1606, PSR 1913+16, and the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor binary after its discoverers) is a pulsar (a radiating neutron star) which, together with another neutron star, orbit around a common center of mass, thus forming a binary star system. PSR 1913+16 was the first binary pulsar to be discovered. It was discovered by Russell Alan Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr., of the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1974. Their discovery of the system and analysis of it earned them the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for the discovery of a new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation.\\" Discovery Using the Arecibo 305m dish, Hulse and Taylor detected pulsed radio emissions and thus identified the source as a pulsar, a rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron star. The neutron star rotates on its axis 17 times per second; thus the pulse period is 59 milliseconds. After timing the radio pulses for some time, Hulse and Taylor noticed that there was a systematic variation in the arrival time of the pulses. Sometimes, the pulses were received a little sooner than expected; sometimes, later than expected. These variations changed in a smooth and repetitive manner, with a period of 7.75 hours. They realized that such behavior is predicted if the pulsar were in a binary orbit with another star, later confirmed to be another neutron star. Pulses from the companion neutron star have not been detected, but this might only be the result of an unfavorable viewing angle. The pulses from the pulsar arrive 3 seconds earlier at some times relative to others, showing that the pulsar's orbit is 3 light- seconds across, approximately two-thirds of the diameter of the Sun. Since this is a binary system, the masses of the two neutron stars can be determined, and they are each around 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Observations have shown that the pulsar's orbit is gradually contracting, which is generally understood to be evidence for the emission of energy in the form of gravitational waves, as described by Einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity, causing the pulsar to reach periastron slightly early. Also, periastron advances 4¬∞ per year in longitude due to the gravitational field (thus the pulsar's periastron moves as far in a day as Mercury's moves in 1.5 million years). Star system The pulsar and its neutron star companion both follow elliptical orbits around their common center of mass. The period of the orbital motion is 7.75 hours, and the two neutron stars are believed to be nearly equal in mass, about 1.4 solar masses. Radio emissions have been detected from only one of the two neutron stars. The minimum separation at periastron is about 1.1 solar radii; the maximum separation at apastron is 4.8 solar radii. The orbit is inclined at about 45 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky. The orientation of periastron changes by about 4.2 degrees per year in direction of the orbital motion (relativistic precession of periastron). In January 1975, it was oriented so that periastron occurred perpendicular to the line of sight from Earth. Use as a test of General Relativity The orbit has decayed since the binary system was initially discovered, in precise agreement with the loss of energy due to gravitational waves described by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. The ratio of observed to predicted rate of orbital decay is calculated to be 0.997¬±0.002. The total power of the gravitational waves emitted by this system presently is calculated to be 7.35 √ó 1024 watts. For comparison, this is 1.9% of the power radiated in light by the Sun. The Solar System radiates only about 5000 watts in gravitational waves, due to the much larger distances and orbit times, particularly between the Sun and Jupiter and the relatively small mass of the planets. With this comparatively large energy loss due to gravitational radiation, the rate of decrease of orbital period is 76.5 microseconds per year, the rate of decrease of semimajor axis is 3.5 meters per year, and the calculated lifetime to final inspiral is 300 million years. In 2004, Taylor and Joel M. Weisberg published a new analysis of the experimental data to date, concluding that the 0.2% disparity between the data and the predicted results is due to poorly known galactic constants, including the Sun's distance from the galactic center, the pulsar's proper motion and its distance from Earth. While there are efforts underway for better measurement of the first two quantities, they saw \\"little prospect for a significant improvement in knowledge of the pulsar distance,\\" so tighter bounds will be difficult to attain. Taylor and Weisberg also mapped the pulsar's two-dimensional beam structure using the fact that the system's precession leads to varying pulse shapes. They found that the beam shape is latitudinally elongated, and pinched longitudinally near the centre, leading to an overall shape like a figure eight. In 2016, Weisberg and Huang published further results, still with a 0.16% disparity, finding that the ratio of the observed value compared to the predicted value was 0.9983 ¬± 0.0016. They name the main driver of this improvement, from 1.8œÉ to 1œÉ discrepancy, as being improved galactic constants published in 2014.

Between the 1960s and early 1990s he was mainly a film artist. In the early 1990s he became involved in politics and became a prominent member of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which led to his appointment to a series of offices. He was director general of Croatian Radiotelevision (1991‚Äì95), and the president of the Croatian Olympic Committee (1991‚Äì2000). Life Born in Imotski, Vrdoljak studied acting at the Zagreb Academy of Dramatic Art. His acting debut was in a 1957 film It Was Not in Vain (Nije bilo uzalud) by Nikola Tanhofer. In 1958, he appeared in Tanhofer's best known film H-8 to much critical acclaim. In the late 1960s, Vrdoljak gradually switched to film directing. Following the events of the Croatian Spring (1968‚Äì71), Vrdoljak became associated with Croatian nationalism. Authorities nevertheless allowed him to continue with his career. This included lavish adaptations of Croatian literary classics such as Kiklop (1982) and Glembajevi (1988). When first democratic elections were announced in Croatia, Vrdoljak was among 200 top intellectuals publicly endorsing the moderate Coalition of People's Accord. By the end of campaign, he switched his support for the more hardline Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and Franjo Tuƒëman, with whom he developed a close friendship. On 30 May 1990 the new democratically elected Croatian Parliament convened and Franjo Tuƒëman was elected President of Croatia. Vrdoljak became one of country's six vice-presidents. As such, he was entrusted with the supervision of 1990 European Athletics Championships in Split. HRT In December 1990, a new Croatian Constitution was adopted, ending the office of vice-president. A few months later, Vrdoljak was appointed to the post of general manager of Croatian Radiotelevision (HRTV), where he promoted Tuƒëman and the HDZ, working hard to prevent any criticism of government on the programme, while Croatian opposition parties were ignored. Vrdoljak garnered a degree of notoriety for saying television \\"must become a cathedral of the Croatian spirit\\". Vrdoljak's removal from HRTV ; 2 February 1996. On 16 September 1991, guards at the entrances of the HRT building told more than 300 employees that their passes were no longer valid. The move was attributed to \\"security reasons\\". Most of those on the security blacklists were Serbs or married to Serbs. Others may have had a relative in the Yugoslav Army or did not publicly support the HDZ.Kemal Kurspahiƒá. \\"Serbo-Croatian War: Lying For The Homeland\\", Prime Time Crime: Balkan Media in War and Peace, p. 67; Ivan Paraƒá, Vrdoljak's successor, charged him with corruption. To the opposition, Vrdoljak had been the embodiment of HDZ domination of the media. Although he maintained his seat in Parliament and other positions, he gradually retired from both politics and Tuƒëman's inner circle. Return to filmmaking After the HDZ lost power in 2000, Vrdoljak decided to return to film-making. He made news in 2006 due to a quarrel and a physical altercation with fellow filmmaker, Lordan Zafranoviƒá.Zafranoviƒá: Nisam udario Vrdoljaka , jutarnji.hr; accessed 12 March 2016.

He received praise for his two early films as a director and screenwriter, Kad ƒçuje≈° zvona (When You Hear the Bells, 1969) and U gori raste zelen bor (A Green Pine Tree grows on the Mountain, 1971). Both films were based on the diaries of Croatian Partisan leader Ivan ≈†ibl. When You Hear the Bells was entered into the 6th Moscow International Film Festival, where it won a Silver Prize. Vrdoljak worked on television, with his 1972 mini-series Prosjaci i sinovi, based on the script (and later the novel) by Ivan Raos, later receiving a cult status. The series was shown only in 1984, due to Raos' status as a \\"Croatian nationalist\\". Vrdoljak also garnered favorable attention for his adaptations of Kiklop (from the novel by Ranko Marinkoviƒá, 1982) and Glembajevi (from the play by Miroslav Krle≈æa, 1988). Both films were broadcast in their longer TV versions. After securing funding from new government, he directed Duga mraƒçna noƒá (The Long Dark Night), a mini-series about World War II in Slavonia.

Carr only began playing first-class cricket in 1909 aged 37 for Kent County Cricket Club. A leg-break bowler who was one of the early proponents of the new googly delivery, he shot to fame in 1909 and enjoyed a short career in the years before the First World War. He was named one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year in 1910. Early life Carr went to the New Beacon in Sevenoaks, Brasenose College at Oxford University and while there played both football and cricket. He injured his knee playing football, and as a result did not make any first-class cricket appearances for the University. Cricket career After leaving Oxford, he spent some years playing club cricket in the Maidstone area. It was during this period, in 1908, that he learnt to bowl the then fairly new googly. The following May he made his first-class debut for Kent against his old university, and took seven wickets in the match, including 5/65 in the first innings. His next chances came in July, in two Gentlemen v Players games, and again he met with success, taking a total of fifteen wickets in the four innings. Carr quickly established himself as a member of the Kent side, and by the second week of August had claimed 42 wickets in his first six first-class games. There was now a clamour for his inclusion in the England team, all the more so as England were 2‚Äì1 down in the 1909 Ashes series at the time. The selectors agreed, and although Carr was twelfth man for the drawn game at Old Trafford, he was picked for the final match of the series at The Oval, becoming the first man ever to play Test cricket for England in his first year in the first-class game. Carr took 7/282 in the match, including 5/146 in the first innings, although his efforts could not force an English victory and the resulting draw meant that the Australians carried off the Ashes. Newspapers and Wisden heavily criticised the England captain Archie MacLaren for over-bowling Carr.Down, Michael. Archie : a biography of A. C. MacLaren. 1909 was also Carr's best in first-class cricket as a whole, as he took 95 wickets including an analysis of 8/36 from 28.1 overs against Somerset. He equaled these innings figures three years later against Gloucestershire. Named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year, in 1910 he helped Kent to the 1910 County Championship title, and in 1912 he averaged just 12.01 in taking 61 first-class wickets. A poor batsman, Carr never made a half-century, and in his later years his batting declined even further. In his last significant season (1913) he scored only 95 runs in 17 innings. In 1914 he played only one match, in late July against Surrey, bowling 28 overs but not taking a wicket. The start of World War I a few weeks later brought an end to his cricketing career. Carr died at the age of 78 in Salcombe Hill near Sidmouth in Devon.

Gairsain is a town and Nagar Panchayat in Chamoli district and is situated at the eastern edge of the vast Dudhatoli mountain range, located almost at the centre of the state, at a distance of approximately 250 kilometres from Dehradun. It is easily accessible from both the Garhwal and the Kumaon divisions, and in a way, acts as the bridge between the two regions. It is being considered as the future Permanent capital of Uttarakhand. Gairsain was envisaged as the state capital during the statehood agitation. However, after the formation of the state on 9 November 2000, Dehradun was made the temporary capital of the state. The Government of Uttarakhand had constituted the Dixit Commission for the search of a permanent capital; but the commission in its report had noted that \\"the interim capital, Dehradun, is a more suitable place as the permanent capital owing to the factors like its distance from national capital, centralised population and safety from natural calamities\\". A three-day-long assembly session of Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly was held at Gairsain from 9 to 12 June 2014. With this event, hopes are high that its stature might be raised to that of the permanent capital of the state, in the near future. Etymology According to tradition, the name Gairsain is derived from the Garhwali words; Gair (‡§ó‡•à‡§∞) meaning 'at some depth' and Sain (‡§∏‡•à‡§£) meaning 'rolling plains', referring to the somewhat flat land at some depth in otherwise hilly terrain. An adjoining village is named Gair (‡§ó‡•à‡§°‡§º) and some attribute the name Gairsain as the deep plain area at the foot of Gair Village. History = Ancient history = King Amogh, a ruler of the Kuninda Kingdom, c. 2nd century BCE In the ancient Indian literature, this area has been celebrated as Kedar Kshetra. The other tradition envisages that Himalayan country is said to be made up of five divisions one of which is Kedar Khanda which has been specifically dealt within the Kedar Khand section of Skand Puran. The Kunindas and Kiratas are also reported to have been inhabitants of this region. According to Hindu tradition the earliest King of this area seems to have been Kubera, the Lord of Yakshas. They were suppressed by Asuras who seem to have principally ruled over what is now Ukhimath. Prithu appears to have been the first King from the plains to visit these parts. After the Mahabharata war, Nagas, Kunindas, Kiratas, Tanganas and Khasas exercised control over this region. For more than a century the area fell under the empire of Kushanas and later on under the sway of Shilvarman, a powerful king who styled himself lord of the mountains. In course of time the Katyuri dynasty became a virtually indigenous ruling family of this region. Katyuri Kings ruled the present area from 9th to 11th centuries. The Katyuris were replaced by Chand Kings in Kumaon, while Garhwal was fragmented into several small principalities. Huen Tsang, the Chinese traveller, who visited the region around 629 AD, mentions a kingdom of Brahampura in the region. Gairsain remained under the sway of Parmar Rajputs of Garhwal during the Medivial period. The Garhwal state was founded in 823 AD, when Kanakpal, the prince of Malwa, on his visit to the Badrinath Temple, met the King Bhanu Pratap, a chieftain of Chandpur Garhi. The King later married his only daughter to the prince and subsequently handed over his kingdom, the fortress town. Kanakpal and his descendants of Parmar dynasty, gradually conquered all the independent fortresses (Garhs) belonging to its 52 small chieftains, and ruled the whole of Garhwal Kingdom for the next 915 years, up to 1804 AD. In 1358, the 37th ruler, Ajay Pal, brought all the minor principalities for the Garhwal region, under his own rule, and founded the Garhwal Kingdom, with Devalgarh as its capital, which he later shifted to Srinagar. At the beginning of the 18th century the bulk of this area was included in the domain of Fateh Shah, the Raja of Garhwal. He was followed by Dilip Sah, Upendra Sah and Pradeep Sah for over half a century. In the beginning of 1803 a severe earthquake occurred in the whole of Garhwal which destroyed many houses and killed many human beings and cattle. Soon after this the Gorkha leaders Amar Singh Thapa, Hastidal Chutariya and some others invaded Garhwal with a large and well equipped army. Amar Singh Thapa was appointed Governor of the region. The Gorkhas were defeated by the British forces in the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814, and Gairsain along with other parts of Kumaon and Garhwal was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Sugauli. In 1839 the district of Garhwal came into existence after being separated from the Kumaon District. In 1919, this area came into prominence as a centre of political activity under the leadership of Anusuya Prasad Bahuguna, a leader who held public meetings against coolie-begar system. In 1930 the civil disobedience movement was made one occasion for launching individual Satyagraha against British Government. In 1947 the area along with rest of country won independence from British rule when it was part of the district British Garhwal also called Pauri Garhwal. = Founding = statehood movement, Uttarakhand Kranti Dal formally declared Gairsain as the capital of the proposed state of Uttarakhand in 1992. Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali was the first person to propose Gairsain as the capital of a hill state in the 1960s. This place eventually began to be projected as the capital of the proposed state during the Uttarakhand state movement. In 1989, Dr. D.D. Pant and Bipin Tripathi accepted Gairsain as the proposed capital of Uttarakhand. An office of Directorate of Higher Education and Diet was inaugurated in Gairsain in 1991. The same year, three BJP ministers and MLAs supported the demand of a separate Uttarakhand state in a public meeting held in the town. The Uttarakhand Kranti Dal, in the year 1992, formally declared Gairsain as the capital of the proposed state of Uttarakhand. UKD, In the honour of Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali, named this proposed capital region as Chandranagar. A hunger strike, which lasted for 157 days, was organised in the year 1994 in order to pressurise the government to announce Gairsain as the capital of Uttarakhand. The same year, a committee headed by Ramashankar Kaushik, which was constituted by then Mulayam Singh Yadav Government, recommended the creation of the hill state of Uttarakhand with Gairsain as its capital. After the formation of Uttarakhand on 9 November 2000, the demand for declaring Gairsain as the state capital started rising across the state. In 2000, the Uttarakhand Mahila Morcha took out a rally demanding Gairsain be made the state capital. Several public demonstrations followed this rally, and in a similar event held in Srinagar in 2002, the Gairsain Rajdhani Aandolana Samiti (Gairsain Capital Movement Committee) was established. Taking these movements into consideration, the Uttarakhand government constituted the Dikshit Commission under the chairmanship of Justice V. Dixit, whose work was to carry out a study among various cities of Uttarakhand, in order to find the most suitable place for the capital of Uttarakhand. The Dikshit Commission narrowed down the search to 5 cities: Dehradun, Kashipur, Ramnagar, Rishikesh and Gairsain; and after taking 8 years, submitted its 80-page report to the Uttarakhand Assembly on 17 August 2008. The commission found Dehradun and Kashipur eligible for the capital, noting \\"the interim capital, Dehradun, is a more suitable place as the permanent capital owing to the factors like its distance from national capital, centralised population and safety from natural calamities\\" and considering the odd geographical conditions, seismic data and other factors, disfavoured Gairsain as the permanent capital. Although, the whole state, baring plains, is in Seismic Zone-5 In 2012, the then Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Vijay Bahuguna organized a cabinet meeting in Gairsain. After the success of this meeting, the foundation stone of a new building for the Uttarakhand Assembly was set in the GIC Ground in the year 2013. The same year, Bhoomi Poojan Program was organized for the Vidhan Sabha Bhavan in Bhararisain, located about 14 km away from Gairsain. A three-day session of the Uttarakhand assembly was organized for the first time in this assembly building that was completed in 2014. In May 2014, a decision was taken by Uttarakhand government to constitute 'Gairsain Development Council' by merging the blocks of Gairsain in Chamoli and Chaukhutia in Almora, and by the end of the year, there were plans to develop Gairsain as the Summer capital of Uttarakhand. Gairsain was given the status of a Nagar Panchayat in 2015‚Äì2016. At the time of its establishment, the city was spread over an area of 7.53 sq. km, and had a population of 7,138 according to the 2011 Census of India. The proposal to develop Gairsain as the Summer capital of the state gained much acceptance by 2017. Another session of the Uttarakhand Cabinet was held in Gairsain in 2017 and the following year, the state government decided to set up an integrated township at Bhararisain. The entire complex was proposed to be developed on the green city concept, which would be equipped with several modern facilities on its sprawling campus including \\"residential apartments and commercial complexes, dispensaries, and schools, besides parks and playgrounds for children and youth\\". On 4 March 2020, the chief minister of Uttarakhand, Trivendra Singh Rawat announced in the Legislative Assembly of the state during budget session that Gairsain would be declared the summer Capital of the state. An official notification to this effect was issued on 8 June 2020 by the government after the then governor, Baby Rani Maurya gave her assent to the move.  Geography  View of snowfall in Dudhatoli hills, as seen from Gairsain Gairsain is just about 16 km from the Almora district border along National Highway 87. The nearest railway station to Gairsain is Ramnagar which is 150 km away. The nearest airport is Gauchar Airport, at Gauchar which is approximately 54 km. = Location = The town of Gairsain is situated in Chamoli District of Uttarakhand in North India. The town is located at and has an average altitude of . The town is 260 km north-east of Dehradun, 170 km south of Badrinath, 140 km north-west of Nainital and approximately 450 km north-east of New Delhi. Gairsain is situated in the center of the state; although it comes within the administrative limits of the Garhwal division, the boundary of Kumaon division starts approximately 15 kilometers from the town. The town is located on the mountains of the Dudhatoli range, and forms its western limit. Gairsain is also the headquarter of the Gairsain Tehsil - one of the six district subdivisions of Chamoli district. The Gairsain Tehsil is spread over an area of and is bound by the Karnaprayag Tehsil on its North, Tharali Tehsil on its East, Chaukhutia Tehsil of Almora district on its south and Thalisain Tehsil of Pauri Garhwal district on its West. = Topography = Gairsain has an unusually gentle topography compared to the other areas of equivalent altitude in the Garhwal region. The slope of the land in the lower regions or 'khet' is around 30 degrees while along the higher slopes it is around 40 degrees. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone 5, in a scale of 2 to 5 (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes). The source of the Ramganga River, \\"Diwali Khal\\", is located near the town; The river flows besides the town, although at a much lower height from it. Gairsain comes under the Ramganga Soil Conservation Project that was initiated to contain the advancement of siltation in the Kalagarh dam. This project, covering the catchment area of the streams feeding the dam, has its head offices located in Ranikhet. Gairsain is located along an anticlinal thrust plane of the Almora nappe. Construction material like granite, gneisses, slates tiles, and limestone, quartzite is found around the town. The types of soil found here are generally the same as found in the hilly areas comprising gravel sand, sandy loam, clayey loam, heavy clay and calcareous soils. The soils maybe divided into 3 categories. One is the red soil found on the slopes and generally sandy is grayish brown when dry and reddish when moist. The brown soils, found in the forests and fields near the town, varies in colour from brown to dark brown depending on the quantity of organic matter contained therein. The podsol soils, clayey in texture, are generally found along the terraced fields. = Climate = Gairsain is situated at an elevation of 1650 metres, and as a result, the climate of the area is largely dependent on its high altitude. The annual average range of temperature is around 15 ¬∞C. In summers the maximum temperature is around 26 ¬∞C while the minimum temperature is around 16 ¬∞C. The winter temperature, however, hovers between 12 and 7 ¬∞C. Skies are heavily clouded during the monsoon months and for short spells when the region is affected by the passage of western disturbances. During the rest of the year the skies are generally clear to lightly clouded. There is snowfall in the months of January and February. The snowfall is usually between 5 and 120 cm, and the snow accumulates for a day or two. The average annual rainfall occurring in the town is 1435 mm. Most of the rainfall occurs during the period between June to September when 70 to 80 percent of the annual precipitation is accounted for. Its location on the southern slopes of the outer Himalayas allows the monsoon currents to enter through the valley. The effectiveness of the rains is, among others, related to low temperature which means less evapotranspiration from the surrounding forests and vegetation cover ‚Äì indicating that the soil moisture in the area is well preserved. The relative humidity is moderately high during the monsoon season around 60 percent but the unpleasant effect is offset by the winds which make it less oppressive. During the winter months the humidity increases towards the afternoon generally. The driest part of the year is the pre monsoon period when the humidity may drop to 35 percent during the afternoon.  Demographics  According to 2011 census of India, Gairsain town is spread over an area of 7.53 sq. km, and the total population residing in the town is 7,138, which gives it population density of 947.94 persons per square kilometer of area, which is greater than the state ratio of 189 people per square kilometer. The number of men in the city is 3,582 while the number of women is 3,556, which gives it a sex ratio of 100.73%. Literacy rate of the town is 87.27 percent. Gairsain, initially a small hamlet, had a recorded population of 2,895 in 1981. The population subsequently rose to 4,228 in 1991 and 6,258 in 2001. It was declared summer capital of Uttrakhand in June 2020. Governance Ex-Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna promised to undertake numerous developmental projects in Gairsain, during his first visit to the town. He promised that an airstrip would be laid in Gairsain. In addition, one session of the legislative assembly will be held annually in Gairsain. A session of Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly was held on 17 and 18 November 2016 for the first time in the newly constructed, grand Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly building at Bhararisain, some 14 km away from Gairsain. Many important legislations were passed during the session. The assembly also resolved to hold the next budget session at Bhararisain. Harish Rawat government has claimed that it is creating infrastructure including roads, water supply, helipads and airstrips around Gairsain to pave its way as capital of Uttarakhand in the coming years. Gairsain Vikas Parishad has been looking over major infrastructure projects in and around Gairsain.  Transport  Due to being located in hilly area, Gairsain has neither rail connections nor a proper air connection, however it is well connected by road. The nearest railhead is located in Ramnagar, which is approximately 150 km from Gairsain. Other nearby Railway stations include Kathgodam (160 km) and Kotdwara (245 km). A railway line connecting Karnaprayag with Rishikesh is under construction, and upon its completion, the Karnaprayag railway station (47 km) will be the nearest railway station to Gairsain. There have also been plans to link Chaukhutia to Ramnagar with a Rail line, which would be instrumental in bringing Gairsain on the Railway map. In may 2019, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned the survey of a new railway track which would connect Gairsain with Tanakpur, Bageshwar, Chaukhutiya, and Karnaprayag. The nearby operational airports are located in Pantnagar, Pithoragarh and Dehradun at a distance of approximately 195, 240 and 260 kilometers respectively. An airstrip exists at Gauchar (55 km) but is used only during special occasions. Government is planning the development of an Airport at Chaukhutia, which is situated in Almora district at a distance of 35 km from Gairsain. Gairsain is well connected by roads with all major cities in the state. National Highway 109 passes through the town, and connects with the cities of Haldwani, Almora, Ranikhet, Dwarahat and Karnaprayag.

In living cells, glutathione disulfide is reduced into two molecules of glutathione with reducing equivalents from the coenzyme NADPH. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione reductase. Antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins, generate glutathione disulfide during the reduction of peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides (ROOH): :2 GSH + ROOH ‚Üí GSSG + ROH + H2O Other enzymes, such as glutaredoxins, generate glutathione disulfide through thiol-disulfide exchange with protein disulfide bonds or other low molecular mass compounds, such as coenzyme A disulfide or dehydroascorbic acid. :2 GSH + R-S-S-R ‚Üí GSSG + 2 RSH The GSH:GSSG ratio is therefore an important bioindicator of cellular health, with a higher ratio signifying less oxidative stress in the organism. A lower ratio may even be indicative of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease. Neuromodulator GSSG, along with glutathione and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), have been found to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their Œ≥-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators.

It provides sports content in South Africa and many other African countries. The channel broadcasts most of the major sporting events and leagues of association football, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf, motorsport, cycling, boxing, wrestling, hockey, athletics. It was previously the world's biggest broadcaster of live rugby and cricket (having been overtaken by Sky Sports), and also the world's second biggest Premier League broadcaster, broadcasting matches live and, where possible, in HD through the Premier League's Content Service Sr. Apart from its satellite channels, SuperSport also feeds content to M-Net, CSN and occasionally to M-Net HD. As of September 2020, much the same way Sky Sports has done, SuperSport started to run thematic channels with most major sports getting their own channels. History In 1986, M-Net was launched as South Africa's first pay-television channel and, along with Canal+, only the second outside of the United States. The channel immediately showed its intention to include sport in its programming line-up, by securing exclusive rights of an important Currie Cup match between Transvaal and Western Province for its first ever broadcast. From 1988, sports coverage on M-Net ran under the banner of M-Net SuperSport. M-Net SuperSport expanded its range of coverage, including live overseas rugby, cricket, golf, boxing and cycling. Following South Africa's readmission into international cricket, SuperSport scored another marketing coup by securing exclusive rights to the 1992 Cricket World Cup. When rugby turned professional in 1995, a deal was struck between the newly formed SANZAR and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. In South Africa, SuperSport was awarded exclusive broadcasting rights of the Super 12 competition, as well as the Tri Nations. Following this deal, rugby gradually ceased broadcasting on the SABC, while SuperSport became a carrier of live rugby broadcasts. At the same time, Naspers expanded its pay- television operations to a satellite carrier. With the launch of DStv in 1995, SuperSport became a multi-channel network and an independent brand, although it was still primarily associated with M-Net. The network made full use of the satellite platform to expand its sports offering: For the Olympic Games, six channels are generally used for live events. In 2007, the SABC lost its exclusive rights to the local Premier Soccer League (PSL) to SuperSport, in a deal worth R1.6 billion. The deal stipulated that some matches had to be shared with the SABC. In August 2011, SuperSport renewed its contract with the PSL for another five years. Since 2011, SuperSport's association with M-Net began to fade, when M-Net split its terrestrial feed from its DStv channel. DStv viewers can no longer watch sports events on M-Net, although terrestrial subscribers still get feeds on the main channel, as well as the Community Services Network (CSN). A Premier Soccer League team bears the channel's name. SuperSport United F.C. was originally known as Pretoria City but bought by M-Net in 1995 after which it was renamed. On August 8, 2020, SuperSport announced a gradual makeover/revamp of its channels, meaning the numbering of the channels since the channel's commencement of expansion in 2003 such as SuperSport 3 would be replaced with specific-sport TV channels which they \\"enhances the sports viewers' experience\\" and \\"makes it easier to find and watch a favorite league, competition or sport\\". The revamp would be operational from September 1, 2020 onwards.

Nicknamed \\"Sacred Handed Scholar\\", he ranks 46th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and tenth among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Xiao Rang, who lives in Jizhou (ÊøüÂ∑û; around present-day Jining and Heze, Shandong), is a scholar good in imitating hand-writings including the distinctive ones of the four famous calligraphers of his time -- Su Dongpo, Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu and Cai Jing. Xiao, nicknamed \\"Sacred Handed Scholar\\" for his rare expertise, is a friend of Wu Yong before the latter became the chief strategist of the Liangshan Marsh outlaws. Becoming an outlaw When Song Jiang is in Jiangzhou (Ê±üÂ∑û; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), where he is exiled for killing his mistress Yan Poxi, he could move in and out of prison freely with permission of the chief warden Dai Zong, a friend of Wu Yong. One day he gets drunk in a restaurant alone. Lamenting his misfortunes, he writes a seditious poem on a wall in the restaurant, which he forgets the next day. Huang Wenbing, a petty official, discovers the poem and reports it to Cai Jiu, the governor of Jiangzhou, leading to Song being locked up and flogged. Cai Jiu orders Dai Zong to take a letter to his father Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing (Êù±‰∫¨; present-day Kaifeng, Henan), from whom he seeks advice on the matter. Passing by Liangshan, Dai Zong is drugged in an inn of the stronghold run by Zhu Gui. Zhu discovers Cai Jiu's letter on Dai and takes him to the bandit chiefs, who learn from Dai the plight of Song Jiang. Wu Yong suggests fooling Cai Jiu to send Song to Dongjing, as it would be easier to rescue him when he is on the road. To forge a letter from Cai Jing requires the help of the scholar Xiao Rang, who could imitate the Grand Tutor's handwriting, and the craftsman Jin Dajian, who could replicate his personal seal. Dai Zong travels to the homes of the two men, who are told their skills are needed for the renovation of a temple. They are lured to the vicinity of Liangshan, where they are taken to the stronghold. Finding themselves trapped, Jin and Xiao have no choice but join Liangshan. They create the fake letter as instructed by Wu Yong. But the seal affixed to the letter happens to be one not appropriate for correspondence between fathers and sons. The letter fools Cai Jiu but not Huang Wenbing, who points out the giveaway. Cai Jiu orders Song Jiang and Dai Zong be executed. Meanwhile, having realised the mistake, Wu Yong sends many chieftains to Jiangzhou, where they save the two just before they are beheaded. Life at Liangshan Xiao Rang is appointed as the chief secretary of Liangshan in charge of all documents and correspondence after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. When Grand Marshal Gao Qiu leads a military attack against Liangshan, he is being captured by the outlaws.

Xiao Rang and Yue He go with him to represent Liangshan's case to the emperor. However, Gao breaks his promise and detains them in his house. They are extricated by Dai Zong and Yan Qing. Campaigns The Liangshan outlaws finally receive amnesty from the emperor with the help of the courtesan Li Shishi and other government officials. Xiao Rang participates in campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory, which are ordered by the court as a way for the outlaws to atone for their crimes.

Before the local-government changes of the late 20th century, the parish had formed part of Boston Rural District, in the Parts of Holland. Holland was one of the three divisions (formally known as parts) of the historic county of Lincolnshire. After the Local Government Act of 1888, Holland was in most respects a county in itself. In 1885 Kelly's Directory recorded Kirton as having a railway station on the Great Northern Railway. This closed in 1961. There existed Congregational and Wesleyan chapels and almshouses for four poor women. The village market was then disused. The Gas Consumers' Company Ltd was formed here in 1865. Principal landowners were The Mercers' Company, Sir Thomas Whichcote DL, E. R. C. Cust DL, the Very Rev. Arthur Percival Purey- Cust DD, and Samuel Smeeton, whose residence was the \\"modern white building\\" of D'Eyncourt Hall. Agricultural production within the parish consisted of wheat, beans and potatoes, and there was a \\"large quantity of pasture land\\" and of marsh land.

By 1835 the school had 40 pupils, partly free and partly fee-paying. The Master (headmaster) appointed in 1773, Rev. Charles Wildbore (c. 1736‚Äì1802), and later his son by the same name (1767‚Äì1842), were alleged to have diverted surplus income from the school's endowments for their own use, and failed to maintain educational standards. This culminated in a parliamentary report, and the management of the school was ultimately restructured in 1851. By 1885, William Cochran was Master, and a new school house had been erected adjacent to his residence. Under a scheme of the Endowed School Act, amended in 1898, the school was ranked as a \\"second-grade\\" Grammar School.Report of the commissioners appointed in pursuance of an act of Parliament made and passed in the 5th and 6th years of King William the 4th, c. 71, intituled, \\"an act for appointing commissioners to continue the inquiries concerning charities in England and Wales, until the first day of March one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven\\"; P.

It was initiated by David Lacey from the Royal Mail, and grew out of a loose affiliation of interested corporate CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers), discussing the topic from the summer of 2003, after an initial meeting hosted by Cisco, but was officially founded in January 2004. It declared success, and merged with The Open Group industry consortium's Security Forum in 2014. The problem It was created because the founding members claimed that no one else was appropriately discussing the problems surrounding de-perimeterisation. They felt the need to create a forum to define and solve consistently such issues. One of the earlier outputs of the group is a position paper entitled the Jericho Forum Commandments which are a set of principles that describe how best to survive in a de- perimeterised world. Membership The Jericho Forum consisted of \\"user members\\" and \\"vendor members\\". Originally, only user members were allowed to stand for election. In December 2008 this was relaxed, allowing either vendor or user members to be eligible for election. The day-to-day management was provided by the Open Group. While the Jericho Forum had its foundations in the UK, nearly all the initial members worked for corporates and had global responsibilities, and involvement grew to Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. Results After the initial focus on defining the problem, de- perimeterisation, the Forum then moved onto focussing on defining the solution, which it delivered in the publication of the Collaboration Oriented Architecture (COA) paper and COA Framework paper. The next focus of the Jericho Forum was \\"Securely Collaborating in Clouds\\", which involves applying the COA concepts to the emerging Cloud Computing paradigm. The basic premise is that a collaborative approach is essential to gain most value from \\"the cloud\\". Much of this work was transferred to the Cloud Security Alliance for use in its \\"guidance\\" document. The final (major) piece of the Jericho Forum's work (from 2009) was around Identity, culminating in 2011 with the publication of their Identity, Entitlement & Access Management Commandments.https://collaboration.opengroup.org/jericho/Jericho%20Forum%20Identity%20Commandments%20v1.0.pdf In its final months the Jericho Forum contributed thinking to the debate around \\"Smart Data\\" and this was handed over to the Security forum within The Open Group to continue, while the work on Identity has been continued by the Global Identity Foundation. Success and closure The Jericho Forum declared success and sunsetted at the London conference of the OpenGroup on 29 October 2013http://blog.opengroup.org/2013/10/29/jericho-forum-declares-success-and- sunsets/ (video). The Jericho Forum work on identity has been carried on by the Global Identity Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation working to define the components of a global digital identity ecosystem, with the Identity \\"commandments\\" directly translating into the principles behind Identity 3.0.

Nicknamed \\"Jade Armed Craftsman\\", he ranks 66th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 30th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Jin Dajian is an engraver from Jizhou (ÊøüÂ∑û; around present-day Jining and Heze, Shandong) whose exquisite skill in carving seals, stone tablets and designs on jade earns him the nickname \\"Jade Armed Craftsman\\". He has known Wu Yong of Liangshan before the latter joins the stronghold. Becoming an outlaw When Song Jiang is in Jiangzhou (Ê±üÂ∑û; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), where he is exiled for killing his mistress Yan Poxi, he could move in and out of prison freely with permission of the chief warden Dai Zong, a friend of Wu Yong. One day he gets drunk in a restaurant alone. Lamenting his misfortunes, he writes a seditious poem on a wall in the restaurant, which he forgets the next day. Huang Wenbing, a petty official, discovers the poem and reports it to Cai Jiu, the governor of Jiangzhou, leading to Song being locked up and flogged. Cai Jiu orders Dai Zong to take a letter to his father Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing (Êù±‰∫¨; present-day Kaifeng, Henan) as he needs the latter‚Äòs advice on how to deal with the matter. Dai Zong passes by Liangshan and is drugged in an inn of the stronghold run by Zhu Gui. Zhu discovers Cai Jiu's letter on Dai and takes him to the bandit chiefs, who learn from Dai the plight of Song Jiang. Wu Yong suggests fooling Cai Jiu to send Song to Dongjing, so that the bandits could rescue him when he is on the way. To forge a letter from Cai Jing requires the help of the scholar Xiao Rang, who could imitate the Grand Tutor's handwriting, and the craftsman Jin Dajian, who could replicate Cai's personal seal. Dai Zong travels to the homes of the two men, who are told their skills are needed for the renovation of a temple. They are lured to the vicinity of Liangshan and taken to the stronghold. Finding themselves trapped, Jin and Xiao have no choice but join Liangshan. They create the fake letter as instructed by Wu Yong. But the seal affixed to the letter happens to be one not appropriate for correspondence between fathers and sons. The letter fools Cai Jiu but not Huang Wenbing, who points out the giveaway. Cai Jiu orders Song Jiang and Dai Zong be executed. Meanwhile, having realised the mistake, Wu Yong sends many chieftains to Jiangzhou, where they save the two just before they are beheaded. Campaigns Jin Dajian is placed in charge of all the engraving works, particularly carving of seals, after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the \\"Grand Assembly\\".

During the early 70s, Warren and his brother Bill formed The Ham Brothers Band and included Ira Wilkes on bass, Red Young on piano and organ and Dahrell Norris on drums. The group recorded for Texas producer Huey P. Meaux. It is widely assumed that the relationship with Meaux did more to hurt The Ham Brothers Band than help and despite critical acclaim for the work, the album never made it in the marketplace. It was soon taken out of print. In 1978 The Ham Brothers band had replaced Wilkes and Young with Bob Parr and Ken Rarrick, both from the acclaimed jazz education program at the University of North Texas. Later that same year, David Gates, of Bread fame, hired the Ham Brothers to tour as part of Bread. The act was then billed as David Gates and Bread. A year later pop diva Cher secured the services of the same band. When Cher recorded the project album Black Rose, Warren joined the band for the recording and the subsequent supporting tour. In his early years, Ham was a vocalist and played the reeds for the Fort Worth, Texas based Bloodrock (1972‚Äì74). Ham appeared on the last two Bloodrock albums: Passage and Whirlwind Tongues. Warren Ham has also toured with Kansas in the John Elefante era (in 1982, played additional keyboards, flute, alto and soprano saxophones, harmonica and backing vocals), Toto (1986-1988, and since 2017), and Donna Summer (1983). He has recently toured with Olivia Newton-John (in 2006) as an instrumentalist and vocalist performing John Travolta's part with Newton-John on her No. 1 Grease hit, \\"You're The One That I Want\\", as well as backing vocals. When Kerry Livgren left Kansas to form his own Christian rock band AD, Ham went with him as the new band's lead singer. Ham appeared on the first, second and fourth of AD's four albums: 1) Timeline 2) Art of the State and 3) Prime Mover. Ham was a featured vocalist and instrumentalist for the Maranatha! Promise Band - the worship band for the Promise Keepers men's movement put together by Maranatha! Music from Promise Keepers' incarnation in 1993 to 1996. He appeared on their 1993 album, Face to Face with the song \\"This Is What I Believe\\", and on their 1996 album, Break Down the Walls, on the song \\"Send Me\\" along with Steven Jackson and Leonard Tucker. He was also a part of the live touring version of the Promise Band for the 1995 Promise Keepers conference season where he played harmonica, saxophone, trumpet, flute, and other wind instruments along with backup vocals. This was documented in the VHS video and CD \\"Live Worship With The Maranatha! Promise Band\\" where he most famously played an intro to \\"Man Of The Spirit, Man Of The Word\\". Clips of some of the songs can be found on YouTube. Since the demise of AD, he has released solo recordings in the contemporary Christian music genre \\"Come on Children\\" and is the author of Beginning Blues/Rock Harmonica ().

Coalition membership  Its establishment was announced on 30 July 2005 by Tomasi Vakatora, a former Cabinet Minister and Speaker of the House of Representatives. The original participating parties were: the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) and the Conservative Alliance (CAMV) (these two parties were already in coalition, comprising bulk of the present government), the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) (which led Fiji's governments from 1992 to 1999), the Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party (NVTL), and the People's National Party (PNP). Coalition membership was later reduced to three parties; the CAMV decided to disband to join the SDL on 17 February 2006, and the PNP withdrew its membership on 7 March, following its decision to merge with the Party of National Unity (PANU) and oppose the coalition in the upcoming parliamentary election. SVT General Secretary Ema Druavesi said on 23 January 2006 that the membership of the coalition was still open to any party willing to join. Vakatora, for his part, clarified on 15 February that membership was not limited to indigenous Fijian parties; if parties led by Indo-Fijians expressed interest in joining, they would be welcomed - provided that they signed the coalition's code of conduct.  Establishment of the coalition  The announcement was the culmination of months of negotiations under the mediation of Vakatora. The five parties agreed to exchange preferences in Fiji's transferable voting system and form a coalition government if its members win a majority of the 71 seats in the House of Representatives. \\"The parties believe that contesting the election together is the best way forward. It will ensure a stable and workable government that will represent a wide cross-section of the community,\\" Vakatora said. Political polarization along racial rather than ideological lines has characterized Fijian politics since responsible government was granted towards the end of colonial rule in the 1960s, but Vakatora denied that the purpose of the coalition was to maintain ethnic Fijian control. \\"It is about political stability, with predominantly Fijian parties making a start, without whom stability in Fiji will be difficult to achieve,\\" he said. The coalition was not closed, he said; other parties - including non-indigenous parties - and individuals were welcome to join, he said. SDL general secretary Jale Baba concurred, saying that his party had non-indigenous members, including Indo- Fijians, and that joining an ethnic Fijian coalition was not a denial of multiracialism. The establishment of the coalition was welcomed by SDL leader and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who said he supported any move to unite Fijians. He added on 2 August that racial politics was a fact of life, and that it was essential for indigenous Fijian parties to unity because the splintering of the indigenous vote had hurt them in the past. He would, however, reach out to Indo-Fijian led parties also, he said. The Presidents and officials of all participating parties met again in the Suva suburb of Nabua on 13 August, and signed a Memorandum of Understanding, confirming that the coalition was a reality. The agreement affirms the independence of each of the participating parties, whilst aiming to ensure that all indigenous Fijian votes are shared amongst all indigenous parties. Vakatora said that the municipal elections due in October 2005 would be a trial-run for the parliamentary election of 2006.  Criticisms  Not all members of all participating parties were completely happy with the coalition. Ema Druavesi, general secretary of the SVT, denied that her party had signed the Memorandum of Agreement establishing the coalition, saying that a party meeting on 13 August would finalize a decision. The Conservative Alliance also appeared to be divided at the top level. It transpired on 3 August that the party president, Ratu Tanoa Cakobau (also known as Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa), had attended the coalition gathering and signed the agreement without informing his colleagues, incurring the ire of the party's now defunct general secretary, Ropate Sivo, who said that the president was not authorized by the party's constitution to negotiate on behalf of the party without informing its members. But his protest was to prove futile when the executives voted Sivo out for insubordination within the party ranks. The Fiji Village news service reported the next day, as a meeting to discuss the dispute was getting underway, that Sivo had told Cakobau that he had done nothing for the party and could \\"walk out\\" any time he chose. The CAMV President maintained, however, that the party's six-member parliamentary caucus and the executives were behind him, and the Fijivillage news service reported on 9 August that plans were underway to remove Sivo from his position. Cakobau expected Sivo's predecessor, Ratu Josefa Dimuri, to be reappointed in his place. Sivo, however, countered that he had no intention of resigning and said that he could be removed only if the party considered him unfit for the position. This was to eventuate soon after. Other parties criticized the developments. National Alliance Party leader Ratu Epeli Ganilau said that in agreeing to the all-indigenous coalition, the ruling SDL had demonstrated that its purported commitment to multiracialism was meaningless. On 14 August, he went further, declaring that the initiative was nothing more than a jostle to retain power. Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry said that the grouping of parties on ethnic lines would further divide the nation, and accused Prime Minister Qarase of using fear tactics to scare indigenous Fijians into supporting indigenous parties, lest Indo-Fijians take over the country. National Federation Party General Secretary Pramod Rae considered that internal differences in the coalition would cause it to be short-lived. Despite his role in the formation of the coalition, former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka expressed doubts about its workability on 27 December. Public feuding among its members threatened to derail the project, he warned. The recent attack on the 1997 Constitution by Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party leader Iliesa Duvuloco had upset him, he said. The coalition was criticized on 17 February 2006 by Ratu Epeli Ganilau, President of the National Alliance Party (NAPF), who accused Coalition spokesman Tomasi Vakatora of racism for saying that indigenous Fijians could not be treated equally with other races. Ganilau called for an investigation into whether Vakatora had breached the Constitution or any other laws. Even the existence of an ethnic coalition was questionable, he considered. \\"For the Prime Minister and Mr Vakatora to be openly advertising the grouping of Fijian political parties is again an action which threatens harmonious racial relations because it encourages polarisation of racial groups and tension amongst them,\\" Ganilau said.  Internal difficulties  Vakatora was quoted by the Fiji Sun on 20 February that the coalition's aim of uniting all indigenous-led parties was hampered by the differences in their manifestos. The decision of the Conservative Alliance to disband and merge with the SDL in mid-February was a positive step, but for other parties to do likewise would be problematic, he thought. NVTLP President Viliame Savu opposed the SDL-CAMV merger, and said he had doubts about the coalition. PNP General Secretary Meli Bogileka said on 3 March 2006 that his party was reconsidering its membership in the coalition. The matter would be decided the following day at a meeting of PNP and PANU officials, he said. On 7 March, he said that a letter was being sent to the Coalition to inform it of the PNP's decision to withdraw.  The 2006 election  The Grand Coalition, renamed the Grand Coalition for Fiji, was launched publicly on 10 February 2006. University of the South Pacific (USP) Vice-Chancellor Anthony Tarr was invited as a guest speaker, a move criticized by the opposition Fiji Labour Party (FLP). FLP President Jokapeci Koroi told Fiji Village on 7 March that the coalition launch was a political move, not an academic one, and that it was out of order for an academic, especially an expatriate one, to be seen to be taking sides in the election. If anyone, the head of a regional university should be siding with politicians who stood for \\"liberal and enlightened policies,\\" she said, rather than with a group that promoted racism. Tarr defended his decision to attend the launch, saying that there was no truth to the insinuation that he endorsed racism. SVT General Secretary Ema Druavesi was quoted in Fiji Village on 10 March as saying that the coalition was uniting indigenous Fijians for the purpose of being able to work with others, and that the group needed an outsider to show them the way forward. The coalition largely disintegrated before the election. The withdrawal of the PNP and the disbanding of the CAMV reduced its membership to three parties; of these, the SVT contested only one constituency out of 71, and the NVTLP a few more. During the campaign, the coalition was barely mentioned, if at all. When the results were tallied, the SDL had won 36 seats and its coalition partners none.

Plot summary  The novel tells the story of the Rainbow catastrophe of 2156. It starts very simple, as a Wave observer Robert Sklyarov notices an unusually persistent Wave and reports it to the Capital (the only city on the scientists' planet, whose primarily mission is conducting zero-transportation experiments, of which the Waves, destroying everything from the planet poles onward, are a sidekick). Simultaneously, Camill (the last remaining of \\"the Baker's Dozen\\") appears at his observation tower and tells him to leave it and fly south immediately. Sklyarov refuses to leave precious ulmotrons behind and urges Camill for help but when the wind front preceding the Wave strikes, the falling machinery seemingly kills Camill. Terrified Sklyarov flees south. Back in the Capital, everything is still quiet. Leonid Gorbovsky, whose Tariel II has delivered scientific equipment to Rainbow, pays a visit to Matvei Vyazanitsyn, the general director of the planet, then returns to his ship, when the ominous news come. Camill contacts (via videophone) the nearest scientist village and issues a warning that the Wave Sklyarov saw is closely followed by another one of a new type. According to him, it cannot be stopped like the ones before and therefore the Rainbow world council must begin the evacuation of the planet immediately. At this moment the Wave reaches Camill's observation tower and he dies once again. Soon enough it becomes clear that humans cannot hold the new Wave back and an order to gather the entire population in the Capital is issued. Robert Sklyarov witnesses the Wave destroying semi-automatic charybdis Wave-stopper tanks and tries to pilot one manually to give his friends time to flee. In the end, his charybdis is destroyed, too, but Sklyarov manages to escape and sets off (on a flier) for the Children Village, where his fianc√©e, Tatiana Turchina, works as a governess. He finds the Village already empty but on the way to the Capital, he locates a crashed aerobus that was carrying some of the children from the Village as well as Turchina herself. Having to choose whom to take with him (his flier can only carry two people), Sklyarov decides for his fianc√©e even though he knows that she would hate him for leaving the children behind. Meanwhile in the Capital, the situation is close to panic. Everyone knows by now that Gorbovsky's Tariel II cannot take them all to space and that the nearest to Rainbow spaceship that can won't make it in time. Plans like burrowing a huge cave under the Capital to hide from the Wave, or jumping over it, or diving under it (in the southern ocean) are desperately developed. At this time, Gorbovsky announces that only the children will be transported onto the orbit on Tariel II, but everyone agrees that this is the best choice. Afterwards a crowd of scientists approaches him and asks to take some of their documentation on board, since they consider it too valuable to be sent directly into space with mini-rockets. And in the very last moment, Gorbovsky refuses to board his ship, leaving his first mate in charge and making even more space for the children and documentation. Tariel lifts off when the Waves (both northern and southern) are a few kilometers away from the Capital. Shortly before the two reach it, Gorbovsky, Camill, Sklyarov and Turchina sit on the beach not far from the city and watch a team of null-T- testers float their blind team-mate toward the southern Wave, while he is playing a song on the banjo.  Trivia  * No canonical text explains how Leonid Gorbovsky escaped the Waves, but he appears again, alive, in Space Mowgli (1971). Addressing this very issue, Boris Strugatsky quotes an entry from the diary of Arkady Strugatsky which makes it clear that in 1962 the brothers did not intend to continue this story-arc.  Publishing history  The novel was originally written in 1962 and first published in Russian in the 1963 sci fi compilation \\"New Signal System\\" (–ù–æ–≤–∞—è —Å–∏–≥–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è) by Soviet Znanie Publishing House, reissued in the same year. In English it was first translated by Alan Myers and published by Soviet Mir Publishing House in 1967. In the United States the novel was again translated by Antonina W. Bouis and published in a 1979 book (with another Strugatskys' novel The Second Invasion from Mars) by Macmillan.

It is also a byproduct of soup soy sauce production. It is sometimes used as a relish.  History  The earliest soybean fermentations in Korea seem to have begun prior to the era of the Three Kingdoms. The Records of the Three Kingdoms, a Chinese historical text written and published in the third century AD, mentions that \\"Goguryeo people are good at brewing fermented soybeans\\" in the section named Dongyi (Eastern foreigners), in the Book of Wei. Jangdoks used for doenjang production are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No.3 from the 4th century Goguryeo. In Samguk Sagi, a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is written that doenjang and ganjang along with meju and jeotgal were prepared for the wedding ceremony of the King Sinmun in February 683. Sikhwaji, a section from Goryeosa (History of Goryeo), recorded that doenjang and ganjang were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as Guhwangchwaryo and Jeungbo sallim gyeongje contain detailed procedures on how to brew good-quality doenjang and ganjang. Gyuhap chongseo explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve doenjang and ganjang.  Production  drying meju Doenjang is made entirely of fermented soybean and brine. Soup soy sauce is also made during the doenjang production. Meju, Korean soybean brick, is made around ipdong in early November. Soybeans are soaked overnight, boiled in salt water, and then pounded in a mortar (jeolgu) or coarsely ground in a millstone. About a doe (‚âà1.8 litres) or two does of pounded soybean is chunked, compressed, and shaped into a cube or a sphere called meju. The meju bricks are then dried in a cool, shaded area for a week to several weeks until firm. When the bricks harden, they are tied with rice straws to the eaves of the house, or put in the warm ondol room with rice straws, for fermentation. In Jeongwol, the first month of the lunar year, well-fermented meju bricks are washed and sun-dried. After drying, the meju bricks are aged in onggi crocks (jangdok) with brine. Charcoal and chillies are added for their absorbent and antibacterial properties, as well as folk-religious beliefs that they drive evil spirits away. When fermented well, the aged meju chunks are mashed to become doenjang, and the filtrate is boiled to become ganjang.  Types  Though doenjang and ganjang are usually made together, doenjang can also be made without producing any filtrate. * Tojang () ‚Äì When the aged brine is boiled to become ganjang, the rest (aged meju chunks) are mashed to become tojang. * Jangjae () ‚Äì Smaller amount of brine is used from the beginning. No soy sauce is produced in the process, and the meju aged with the smaller amount of brine becomes jangjae, another type of doenjang. While traditional doenjang is made with soybeans and brine only, many factory-made variants of doenjang contain a fair amount of wheat flour just like most factory-made soy sauce does. Some current makers also add fermented, dried, and ground anchovies to accentuate doenjang's savory flavor. Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's Food Code classifies doenjang into three categories by their ingredients. * Hansik-doenjang (, \\"Korean-style fermented soybean paste\\") ‚Äì doenjang made with traditional style meju and brine. * Doenjang (, \\"fermented soybean paste\\") ‚Äì doenjang made with non-traditional meju (which can be made of soybean, rice, barley, wheat or degreased soybean, and ripened using traditional method or Aspergillus) and saline solution. * Seasoned doenjang () ‚Äì product that contains more than 90% of doenjang or hansik-doenjang. Use A bowl of homemade doenjang jjigae Doenjang can be eaten as a condiment in raw-paste form with vegetables, as flavored seasoning or even as a dipping condiment. However, it is more commonly mixed with garlic, sesame oil, and sometimes gochujang to produce ssamjang, which is then traditionally eaten with or without rice wrapped in leaf vegetables such as red leaf lettuce. This dish is called ssambap. This combination of leaf vegetable and doenjang (or ssamjang) often complements popular Korean meat dishes, for example samgyeopsal, bulgogi, bibimbap and bossam. It can also be used as a component of soup broth, for example in a popular stew (jjigae) called doenjang jjigae which usually includes tofu, various vegetables such as chile peppers, zucchini, and scallion, and (optionally) mushrooms, red meat, or scallops. Nutrition and health Doenjang is rich in flavonoids and beneficial vitamins, minerals, and plant hormones (phytoestrogens) which are sometimes claimed to possess anticarcinogenic properties. In Korean traditional meals, the menu has concentrated on vegetables and rice, but doenjang, which is made of soybeans, has a great deal of lysine, an essential amino acid that rice lacks. Linoleic acid (53% of the fatty acids) and linolenic acid (8% of the fatty acids) have an important role in normal growth of blood vessels and prevention of blood vessel-related illness. Doenjang's efficacy still exists after boiling, in dishes such as doenjang jjigae. Claims are being explored about the role of doenjang in reducing visceral fat, though most studies have only been done on rodents. However, one study on humans does exist, which suggests that its visceral fat reduction properties are also present in humans. Outside Korea Doenjang is considered one of the essential sauces of authentic Korean cuisine. However, the condiment has historically been unknown outside of Korea, although recent international articles have resulted in an increase in its popularity. A 2007 Chinese article on the \\"Sauces of Korea\\" listed doenjang and gochujang as essential flavorings, and explored the origins of the condiments, particularly focusing on Sunchang County, where most Korean soy sauce is produced. The article pointed out that doenjang does not contain any artificial additives and in fact has healthy amounts of essential vitamins, such as vitamin C and vitamin B12. The health benefits of doenjang are rumored to extend longevity, and this is illustrated by the fact that out of the 32,000 people in Sunchung County, eight are over 100 years old, and many are over 90. The article was influential throughout China, resulting in many Chinese restaurants adding doenjang jjigae modified slightly to Chinese tastes, to their menus shortly after publication. South Korea's JoongAng Ilbo covered this story in China on December 13, 2007.JOINS  ÏïÑÏãúÏïÑ Ï≤´ Ïù∏ÌÑ∞ÎÑ∑ Ïã†Î¨∏  Similar food  A very similar fermented soybean paste in northeast China is known as dajiang (Â§ßÈÜ¨). The tradition of eating dajiang is said to have been started by the Manchu people, who originally occupied China's northeastern provinces. Northeastern Chinese people enjoy eating raw vegetables in the summer, and dajiang is used like a salad dressing to add flavor. Northern Chinese yellow soybean paste also bears a great similarity in texture and taste to Korean doenjang. Doenjang also bears similarities to Japanese miso, although miso is fermented with a fungus (Aspergillus oryzae) and doenjang is fermented with a bacterial culture (Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus subtilis). In popular culture Doenjang jjigae was the basis of a Korean movie called The Recipe, released in 2010. It was about a death-row inmate who makes his last wish for a bowl of the stew. \\"Doenjang girl\\" is a popular term for women who indulge in luxurious products to show off, despite not being able to afford them and eats low-priced basic food at home.Ïã§ÏÇ¨Î°ú Î≥¥Îäî‚Ä¶ 'Ïù¥Í≤ÉÏù¥ ÎêúÏû•ÎÖÄÏùò ÌïòÎ£®!'

In 1992 she was chosen by her colleagues to become the state's first woman Chief Justice.https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/women/margaretbrent/07/BarkettBio_TownHall.authcheckdam.pdf As Florida's first female Supreme Court Justice, her appointment highlighted a number of gender-bias issues within the institution. Prior to her appointment, the floor where justices' chambers were located in the Supreme Court Building had only two restrooms, one marked \\"Justices,\\" the other marked \\"Ladies.\\" In addition to that change, her tenure ended the use of the title \\"Mr. Justice.\\" Barkett was to be called \\"Madam Justice Barkett,\\" which she felt was inappropriate because she was not married and \\"did not qualify for the other definition of Madam.\\" Instead she requested to be addressed simply as \\"Justice Barkett.\\" The other justices followed suit and dropped \\"Mr.\\" from their titles. To remain on the state Supreme Court, Barkett survived a rancorous merit retention election in 1992, receiving a favorable vote of 61 percent. During that battle, organizations such as the National Rifle Association and Florida Right to Life developed negative advertising campaigns.http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr42-3and4/CR42-3GoodmanMarks.pdfhttp://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr39-3/CR39-3Cecil.pdf Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals On September 24, 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated Barkett to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (which reviews cases from Florida, Alabama, and Georgia). The seat had been vacated by Paul Hitch Roney.https://clintonwhitehouse6.archives.gov/1993/09/1993-09-24-judicial- appointment.html Barkett's nomination was hotly contested by newspaper columnists and such conservative politicians as Orrin Hatch, who was, at the time, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. As described in the New York Times, the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones, and a 2014 book, The Biblical Truth About America's Death Penalty, much of the focus was on Barkett's supposedly being soft on crime. The opposition focused on her being against the death penalty, though she had affirmed the death penalty 275 times while on the state supreme court. In a 1994 New York Times op-ed, Anna Quindlen described how Barkett was Borked by such senators as Strom Thurmond, who \\"spelled out the gory details of every murder case in which the Chief Justice had voted to overturn death sentences.\\" Barkett was eventually confirmed by the Democratic-controlled United States Senate by a 61-37 vote, and she received her commission the following day, April 15, 1994. Between 1994 and 1996, a wide range of conservative politicians made explicit use of Barkett in political attack ads that tried to connect her with their political opponents. For example, in a Tennessee senate race, Bill Frist upset the incumbent Jim Sasser after emphasizing that Sasser had voted to confirm Barkett for the seat on the Court of Appeals. In a California Senate race, Michael Huffington took out full-page newspaper ads outlining ways in which Barkett was a liberal activist judge, and linking Barkett with his opponent in that race, Dianne Feinstein, who had also voted for Barkett's confirmation. While trying to paint Bill Clinton as soft on crime, the Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole included Barkett among 4 judges in his \\"judicial Hall of Shame.\\" As pointed out in an NYU law review article, Barkett rendered 12,000 decisions and wrote 3000 opinions while on the state bench, but most of these attack ads focused on a single dissent in which the opinion was written by another member of the court. In addition, while being reviewed, Barkett was supported by Florida's Fraternal Order of Police, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, and the Correctional Peace Officers Association. U.S. Appeals Court judges tend to hear appeals in groups of three, and Judge Barkett‚Äîconsidered one of the few liberal judges among the twelve Appeals Court judges in her three-state region‚Äîis perhaps best known for her dissenting opinions after having been outvoted 2-1. For example, Warren Lee Hill had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death. After sentencing, additional evidence arose that indicated he was intellectually disabled, which‚Äîif true‚Äîwould have precluded a lawful execution. As quoted in the New York Times and The American Prospect, Barkett's 2013 dissent included the following: \\"The idea that courts are not permitted to acknowledge that a mistake has been made which would bar an execution is quite incredible for a country that not only prides itself on having the quintessential system of justice but attempts to export it to the world as a model of fairness.\\" Hill was executed in 2014. Barkett was twice outvoted when her court refused to hear appeals after lawyers for death row inmates missed deadlines. As she said in one dissent: \\"It is unjust and inequitable to require death row inmates to suffer the consequences of their attorneys' negligence.\\" The United States Supreme Court took up both of these cases (Maples v. Thomas and Holland v. Florida) and then overturned both of the decisions, essentially agreeing with Barkett's dissent. In 2004, the 12 judges of the Eleventh District voted 6-6 to not review a Florida case regarding adoption by gay parents. The tie meant the case would not be reviewed. Jeb Bush, the Florida governor, praised the decision, indicating that the court decision \\"validates Florida's conclusion that it's in the best interest of adopted children to be in homes anchored by both a father and a mother.\\" Barkett's dissent pointed out that only gay people were excluded from adoption, that there is no rule forbidding child molesters and domestic abusers from adoption. As quoted in The Advocate, Barkett's dissent underlined the disparity: \\"In a very real sense, Florida's adoption statute treats homosexuals less favorably than even those individuals with characteristics that may pose a threat to the well-being of children.\\" After noting that Florida allows single people to adopt and allows gays to be permanent foster parents, Barkett continued, \\"in the context of adoption, this disparity of treatment on the face of the statute amounts to the purest form of irrationality.\\" In 2008, Barkett dissented in a case that involved Florida's system for purging the voting lists (Florida State Conference of the NAACP v. Browning). As discussed in The New York Review of Books, Barkett's written dissent underlined the disparate racial impact of the Florida plan: while black voters made up 13 percent of the scanned pool, they comprised 26 percent of those who were purged. White voters, meanwhile, comprised 66 percent of the pool, but only 17 percent of the rejected group. In 2011, Barkett wrote the Appeals Court decision that found that discrimination against transgender individuals qualifies as unconstitutional sex-based discrimination (Glenn v. Brumby). Judge Bill Pryor joined Barkett in the 2-1 majority. This became problematic for Pryor in 2017, when this decision was used against him when he was considered for the U.S. Supreme Court by President Donald Trump. Barkett retired from the court, effective September 30, 2013, in order to accept a post on an international tribunal. Even as she left the federal bench, Barkett inspired controversy. The insider web site law.com glowingly concluded that Barkett was \\"in a class by herself,\\" while the conservative magazine National Review celebrated the end of \\"Rosemary Barkett's 34-year Reign of Error in the American judiciary.\\" Iran‚ÄìUnited States Claims Tribunal Barkett joined the Iran‚ÄìUnited States Claims Tribunal on October 1, 2013, having been selected by the United States Department of State for the post. The Tribunal is located in The Hague, Netherlands.http://www.iusct.net/General%20Documents/z7-Barkett.pdf Teaching and outside activity While serving on the federal bench, Barkett long taught a seminar on Human Rights and Comparative Constitutions at Columbia Law School with Professor Louis Henkin. Barkett also served on the faculties of Florida's Judicial College, the National Judicial College, The Institute of Judicial Administration's New Appellate Judge Seminar, and the Aspen Institute. She has given lectures in countries throughout the world, including Syria, Qatar, Turkey, South Africa, Algeria, China, Haiti, Khyrgystan, and Mexico. Since leaving the Federal bench, Barkett's academic focus has been on justice and human rights. For example, she gave the 2015 Madison Lecture at New York University's law school, where she described how the U.S. lags behind their international peers with regards to protecting women and children's human rights. In 2016, Barkett and another former chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court Harry Lee Anstead joined with other senior attorneys to submit a brief on a death penalty case, in which they argued that the state's death penalty law was unconstitutional. As outlined in the Miami Herald, they argued that 390 people on Florida's death row should have their penalties reduced to life in prison. Barkett served as the 2015-16 Scholar in Residence at the Sorensen Center for International Peace and Justice at the law school at the City University of New York. She serves on the Board of Measures for Justice, an organization dedicated to bringing greater transparency to the legal system. Barkett is also the honorary president of the American Society of International Law. Honors Barkett has won dozens of awards and has been awarded seven honorary degrees. Two awards are given in her honor each year. The Rosemary Barkett Award is presented annually by the Academy of Florida Trial Lawyers to recognize efforts to provide equal justice. The Rosemary Barkett Outstanding Achievement Award is given annually by the Florida Association of Women Lawyers.http://www.fawl.org/assets/docs/2017-2018%20FAWL%20Nomination%20Form%20-%20Rosemary%20Barkett%20Outstanding%20Achievement%20Award.pdf The Rosemary Barkett Appellate Inn of Court was founded in 2010 by Florida International University, the Third District Court of Appeal, and the American Inns of Court Program. The Judge Rosemary Barkett Litigation Program was created in 2017 by the Americans for Immigrant Justice, a not-for-profit legal assistance organization that seeks to protect and promote the basic human rights of immigrants. Barkett has served on dozens of boards and national/international committees. She was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 1986 and was a long-time member of the Board of Trustees of Barry University. Barkett is also featured in a non-fiction children's book, A Kid's Guide to Arab-American History, alongside a description of immigration patterns and a recipe for making hummus.

Vakatora entered the House of Representatives as a member of the ruling Alliance Party in 1977 and served in a variety of ministerial positions in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1982, and served till the house was dissolved in 1987. He was appointed Minister of Finance in 1992. In 1995, the Fijian government chose Vakatora as its representative on the Constitutional Review Commission, set up to rewrite the Constitution that had been promulgated in 1990 which many Indo-Fijians alleged discriminated against them. In 2005 and early 2006, Vakatora spearheaded moves to forge an electoral alliance among indigenous Fijian-led political parties ahead of parliamentary elections held on 6‚Äì13 May 2006. On 30 July 2005, Vakatora announced that five such parties, including the ruling Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua, had agreed to such a coalition. The parties would exchange preferences and, if elected, form a coalition government. The coalition all but collapsed, however, when two parties pulled out, a third dissolved itself, and a fourth nominated only one candidate. On 11 August 2005, Vakatora called for Indo-Fijian and minority representation in the House of Representatives to take account of population changes. The three seats allocated to minorities (Europeans, Chinese, and others) were already more than their population numbers warranted, he said, reacting to calls from Labour Minister Kenneth Zinck for their numbers to be increased. Since the 1996 census, the indigenous majority had increased, he claimed, but changes to parliamentary representation would be possible only through a constitutional amendment, which he called for. Vakatora's calls were immediately rejected by Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who said that Indo-Fijians were already underrepresented, claiming that they had given up two seats in the constitutional revision of 1997 in order to make way for the minority groups. They had been \\"short-changed,\\" he said. United Peoples Party leader Mick Beddoes, whose party mostly represents minorities, also said that he would fight any moves to reduce their representation in the House of Representatives. Vakatora was originally from Naivilaca village in Rewa. In his last years, when not addressing politics at the national level, Vakatora spent time advising Rewan villagers on the controversial Qoliqoli Bill and how it would affect them. He was also involved in the establishment of the Noco Development Bus Company. Vakatora's autobiography, From the Mangrove Swamps, tells of his life as a simple village boy who enjoyed catching mud crabs, to his rise to the corridors of power, as a senior civil servant, a government minister, and Speaker of Parliament. He attended Lelean Memorial School. Vakatora, 79, was survived by his wife Wainiqolo Vakatora, five children, seventeen grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. At his funeral, held at Butt Street Wesley Church in Suva, Rev. Akuila Yabaki (a close personal friend, despite political differences) described Vakatora, the son of a Methodist minister, as a committed Christian whose life was characterized by weekly prayer meetings in his home.

It now advocates secular humanism and is a member of the Humanists International. History The rear interior of South Place Ethical Chapel, Finsbury. Photo taken c. 1870 The Society's origins trace back to 1787, as a nonconformist congregation, led by Elhanan Winchester, rebelling against the doctrine of eternal damnation. The congregation, known as the Philadelphians or Universalists, secured their first home at Parliament Court Chapel on the eastern edge of London on February 14 1793. William Johnson Fox became minister of the congregation in 1817. By 1821 Fox's congregation had decided to build a new place of worship, and issued a call for \\"subscriptions for a new Unitarian chapel, South Place, Finsbury\\". Subscribers (donors) included businessman and patron of the arts Elhanan Bicknell. In 1824 the congregation built a chapel at South Place, in the Finsbury district of central London. The chapel was repaired by John Wallen, of a family of London architects and builders. This chapel later became the home of South Place Ethical Society. In 1929 they built new premises, Conway Hall, at 37 (now numbered 25) Red Lion Square, in nearby Bloomsbury, on the site of a tenement, previously a factory belonging to James Perry, a pen and ink maker. Conway Hall is named after an American, Moncure D. Conway, who led the Society from 1864‚Äì1885 and 1892‚Äì1897, during which time it moved further away from Unitarianism. Conway spent the break in his tenure in the United States, writing a biography of Thomas Paine. In 1888 the name of the Society was changed from South Place Religious Society to South Place Ethical Society (SPES) under Stanton Coit's leadership. In 1950 the SPES joined the Ethical Union. In 1969 another name change was mooted, to The South Place Humanist Society, a discussion that sociologist Colin Campbell suggests symbolized the death of the ethical movement in England.Colin Campbell. 1971. Towards a Sociology of Irreligion. London: MacMillan Press. The original name, South Place Ethical Society, was retained until 2012, when it changed to Conway Hall Ethical Society. In November 2013 Elizabeth Lutgendorff was elected Chair of the Conway Hall General Committee, becoming the youngest Chair in the society's history. On 1 August 2014 the society became a Charitable Incorporated Organisation with a new charitable object: \\"The advancement of study, research and education in humanist ethical principles\\". This replaced the previous object: \\"The study and dissemination of ethical principles and the cultivation of a rational religious sentiment.\\" Conway Hall Invitation to the opening ceremony at Conway Hall, Red Lion Square. Monday 23 September 1929. Chaired by C. Delisle Burns. Speakers: Gilbert Murray, Graham Wallas, John A. Hobson, Richard H. Walthew, Athene Seyler. Music: Maurice Cole, Winifred Small Conway Hall was designed by Frederick Mansford, being built on an L-shaped strip of land which the Society had acquired between Theobald's Road and Lamb's Conduit Passage. It is a Grade II listed building built in 1929 and was Mansford's largest project. The main entrance is located on an angle with a narrow arch rising to the top of the upper floor. The arch is flanked by two columns in silver-grey brick while the rest of the building is varied with red-brick detailing. There is a lot of glass in the facade with wide windows to the Library on the upper level and in and above the entrance doors. The glazing bars form a distinctive tiny criss- cross pattern reflected in Conway Hall's logo. The general feel is that of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon, the old Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. Mansford was aware that his design could appear incoherent and tried to make the elevation hang together by placing six stone urns, bought from a City bank, along roof level, two of them on top of the entrance columns. The main auditorium can hold 300 plus 180 in a gallery and in recent years has been used as a corporate events space for conferences and product launches. Wooden panelling nailed directly to the brickwork and acoustic plaster was used to give the hall excellent acoustic qualities, considered the best hall in London for chamber music. This made it very suitable for the performance of music and there have been regular recordings and concerts there. The ceiling of the auditorium was glazed and this made it very light and airy for the time. It opened in 1929 and has continued in use since. Above the proscenium arch the words, To Thine Own Self Be True, (a quote by Polonius from Shakespeare's Hamlet), can be seen. These words were originally inscribed on the back wall of the red mahogany panel at the original South Place Chapel. =Film Location= The hall has been used as a location for various film and television productions. The building has appeared in Mr Holmes, The Bodyguard and Hereafter. Humanist Ceremonies In 1935 twenty members of the Society signed a document stating that Conway Hall was their regular place of worship. It was therefore certified for marriages by the Registrar-General until 1977 when the Deputy Registrar-General ruled that the Hall could not be used for weddings under the terms of the Places of Worship Registration Act. This followed the report in the winter of 1975 of a marriage solemnised at Conway Hall. He was probably influenced by the 1970 ruling of Lord Denning, that marriages could only be solemnised in places whose principal use is for the \\"worship of God or [to do] reverence to a deity. Until the ruling the Society had an established tradition of performing secular funerals, memorial ceremonies and namings of children at Conway Hall.  Sunday Concerts  The Sunday Concerts at Conway Hall can be traced back to 1878 when the Peoples Concert Society was formed for the purpose of \\"increasing the popularity of good music by means of cheap concerts\\". Many of these concerts were held at the South Place Institute but in 1887 the Peoples Concert Society had to cut short their season through lack of funds. It was then that the South Place Ethical Society undertook the task of organising concerts under the first Honorary Secretary Alfred J. Clements and Assistant Secretary George Hutchinson who continued to run them under the name 'South Place Sunday Concerts'. The thousandth concert was played on 20 February 1927, and the two- thousandth concert was held at Queen Elizabeth Hall on 9 March 1969. Clements was the Honorary Secretary for over 50 years, from 1887‚Äì1938. In 1929 the South Place Ethical Society had the Conway Hall purpose built for them and with the exception of the war years, the concert seasons have continued. The concerts have now been organised by Artistic Director, Simon Callaghan. =Hawkins Catalogue= Frank A. Hawkins served as Treasurer of the Sunday Concerts for 24 years from 1905 until his death in June 1929. He collected nearly 2,000 pieces of sheet music of principally classical and romantic chamber music, which were bequeathed to the Society. The collection has been catalogued by composer and instrument combination and is held on the Conway Hall premises.  Conway Memorial Lecture  The Conway Memorial Lecture was inaugurated by the Society in 1910 to honour Moncure Conway who died in 1907. The decision to create the Lecture was made in 1908 and the first Lecture, The Task of Rationalism, was given by John Russell and is presumed to have been chaired by Edward Clodd. Prominent Lecturers have included Bertrand Russell, Lancelot Hogben, Stanton Coit, Joseph Needham, Edward John Thompson (1942), Jacob Bronowski, Fred Hoyle, Margaret Knight, Harold Blackham, Laurens van der Post, Fenner Brockway, Jonathan Miller, David Starkey, Bernard Crick, AC Grayling and Roger Penrose. No Lectures took place in 1958, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, or 1966. The 2014 Conway Memorial Lecture was given by Professor Lisa Jardine on 26 June 2014.

The film was one of two produced concurrently following the death of the series' star Peter Sellers. Whereas the previous film Trail of the Pink Panther made use of unused footage of Sellers as Inspector Clouseau and starred Joanna Lumley as journalist Marie Jouveat, Curse attempted to relaunch the series with a new lead, Ted Wass, as inept American detective Clifton Sleigh, assigned to find the missing Inspector Clouseau. The film features a cameo by Roger Moore‚Äîas Clouseau himself‚Äîat the end of the film. This was David Niven's final film appearance, and he died two weeks before its release. The film marked Herbert Lom's sixth outing as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus. He would reprise the role for the last time in Son of the Pink Panther (1993). Capucine also made her third and final appearance as Simone. The film also featured the sixth Panther appearances of Clouseau's manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk) and Sgt. Fran√ßois Chevalier (Andr√© Maranne). Cato, Dreyfus, and Fran√ßois all debuted in A Shot in the Dark (1964). The film was a box office failure and received unanimously negative reviews. Plot In Lugash, the fabled Pink Panther diamond is stolen. A mysterious woman looking to procure the priceless gem has a t√™te-√†-t√™te with a man regarding price. Suddenly, Clouseau (having disappeared inexplicably on a plane flight in the previous film) bursts in. The woman shoots the man, then points the gun at Clouseau. His fate is a mystery. Meanwhile, his former superior, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), is pressured to oversee Operation Paragon and utilize Interpol's fictitious Huxley 600 computer Aldous to find the world's greatest detective to solve the crime. What the world at large does not realize is that Clouseau was actually an inept fool whose cases were solved more through luck than actual detective genius, and that his accident-prone incompetence led Dreyfus to a series of nervous breakdowns. Anxious never to see or hear from his nemesis again, Dreyfus sabotages the computer to select the world's worst detective. This turns out to be Sergeant Clifton Sleigh (Ted Wass), an incompetent officer of the New York Police Department. Sleigh, who is descended from a long line of cops, sees the case as an opportunity to prove his worth. Dreyfus and his long-suffering assistant, Sergeant Fran√ßois Durval (Andr√© Maranne), soon find that the sabotage has worked a bit too well: while slightly more intelligent and capable, Sleigh is just as clumsy as Clouseau. When Sleigh meets Dreyfus for the first time in his office, Sleigh trips over his own feet and knocks Dreyfus into his wheeled office chair, which rolls out onto the balcony - and sends Dreyfus falling three stories into a pond below, breaking his left leg. Sleigh visits Dreyfus in the hospital to apologize, but accidentally ends up hurting Dreyfus more by falling over the hospital equipment holding Dreyfus's leg. As he sets out on the case, Sergeant Sleigh encounters many people who prefer Clouseau not return: these include the Inspector's former manservant, Cato (Burt Kwouk), who attacks Sleigh when he breaks into the Clouseau Museum Cato now operates; Dreyfus, who attempts to kill Sleigh numerous times like he tried to kill Clouseau; and Bruno Langlois (Robert Loggia), the mafia boss from the previous film. Langlois orders several assassination attempts on Sleigh, but the detective's bumbling nature allows him to survive. Ultimately, Langlois, along with his henchmen (including Mr. Chong from Revenge of the Pink Panther) have a final showdown with Sleigh in a dark alley in Valencia, Spain, during Carnival. Juleta Shayne (Leslie Ash), an employee of the enigmatic Countess Chandra, comes to Sleigh's rescue and manages to defeat Langlois and his thugs in street combat. Sleigh also meets Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven), who is now married to Clouseau's former wife Simone (Capucine) and is accompanied by his nephew George (Robert Wagner). Sir Charles was the notorious jewel thief known as \\"the Phantom\\", though only Clouseau was convinced of this. The Phantom would steal items of jewellery and leave behind a monogrammed white glove. Eventually, Sleigh's trail leads to a health spa run by Countess Chandra (Joanna Lumley). There he meets famous British film star Roger Moore, who speaks with a rather odd French accent and falls about all over the place. Seeing a photograph of the Inspector, Countess Chandra tells Sleigh that Clouseau visited her several months ago but claimed his name was Gino Rossi (the thief who stole the diamond in the last film and was seen fencing it to Countess Chandra at the start of this film when the real Inspector arrived on the scene). She recalls he was looking for a good plastic surgeon and she recommended one. Sleigh concludes, erroneously, that Clouseau stole the Pink Panther diamond, underwent plastic surgery, and changed his name to Gino Rossi. The real jewel thief's body was found washed up on shore after he was shot to death. It is believed that Clouseau was killed for the diamond. Anxious to be rid of Sleigh, Dreyfus announces that Sleigh has solved the mystery and officially closes the case, though it is clear that Dreyfus does not believe that this is what happened. In a final irony, as Dreyfus sets fire to Gino Rossi's photograph - happy to be rid of Clouseau once and for all - he accidentally sets fire to his office. Sleigh runs in and attempts to put out the fire with a hose, only to accidentally hit Dreyfus with the water, the force of which pushes him onto his balcony and Dreyfus again falls three stories into the pond below. Film star Roger Moore was, in fact, Clouseau after very extensive plastic surgery. Clouseau has become Countess Chandra's lover and partner in crime. When Clouseau and Chandra open her hidden wall safe to admire The Pink Panther, they discover they have been robbed, and a white monogrammed glove has been left behind. \\"Swine Phantom!\\" mutters Clouseau, knowing only too well who is responsible for the theft. In the final scene, Sir Charles, Simone, and George are sailing away on board their yacht with the Pink Panther jewel, which Simone has stolen. In a pre-credits scene, the animated Pink Panther is shown stealing the Pink Panther jewel. Realizing it's heavy, he slips out of the shot and drops the diamond offscreen, shattering it. The credits roll shortly afterwards. Cast * Ted Wass as Sgt.

Curse of the Pink Panther had been the original working title for what became Revenge of the Pink Panther, made five years previously. In Trail of the Pink Panther, Joanna Lumley had been a TV investigative reporter. Here she is cast as the aristocratic owner of a health spa, Countess Chandra. Dudley Moore, previously briefly considered for the role of Clouseau for Romance of the Pink Panther following Sellers' death, had been Blake Edwards' original choice for the role of Det. Clifton Sleigh, but Moore turned it down, not wishing to commit to a series following the success of Arthur. Edwards suggested Rowan Atkinson for the role, but MGM rejected the choice, as Atkinson was little known outside of Britain at the time. John Ritter was also in discussion for the role before it fell to Ted Wass. Ted Wass was placed under contract with Edwards for six Panther films (including this one). The plan was to retire the characters of Dreyfus, Cato, Francois, and Professor August Balls. Edwards told the LA Times that the series would change geographically. NYPD Lt. Palmyra would have continued as Sleigh's Dreyfus-type boss character and Charlie (the hip black cop) would have been a role similar to Francois. The series would probably have resembled the Police Academy movies more than the classic Pink Panther films. MGM wanted to continue with a cheaper version of the series. Edwards wanted the series to continue as comedy's answer to James Bond. Edwards would not have directed the later Wass films (Terry Marcel was slated to helm the next one) and Edwards' son, Geoffrey Edwards and Sam Bernard would have scripted. Edwards' co-producer, Tony Adams planned to produce one Panther film every three years in order to finance smaller projects, depending on how the movie would perform. After the critical and financial failure of this film, all of these plans were promptly abandoned. David Niven, Capucine, and Robert Wagner had been the stars of the original Pink Panther film. This was Niven's final film, and due to his failing health his voice was dubbed by impressionist Rich Little during post-production. Roger Moore's scenes were filmed during a break from shooting Octopussy. He was credited as \\"Turk Thrust II\\", a nod to actor Bryan Forbes, who was credited as \\"Turk Thrust\\" in the 1964 Clouseau film, A Shot in the Dark. Clouseau turning to a life of crime and living together with a criminal countess was an element borrowed from Peter Sellers' unfilmed Romance of the Pink Panther script which had, in the second of the script's two drafts, Clouseau leaving the force and joining his new wife, the archcriminal \\"The Frog\\", in a life of crime. In her autobiography, Joanna Lumley discusses how the scene with Moore and Wass in her chalet was shot in one take with no rehearsals. This was because MGM was at war with Edwards over the budget and shooting schedule and the scene had to be shot last as Moore was then shooting Octopussy concurrently. \\"Sellers and I usually thoroughly rehearsed set pieces (although not quite as much by Revenge, I have to admit) and shot them numerous times,\\" as evidenced in the alternate takes as seen in Strikes Again/Trail and so forth. \\"We didn't have that here. Curse suffered from this tremendously--particularly with the key wrap-up scenes.\\" A new arrangement for \\"The Pink Panther Theme\\" (similar to the theme from Revenge of the Pink Panther) with heavy synthesizers is present, to align the theme with '80s music trends. The cartoon opening and closing credits for the film were animated and produced by Marvel Productions and written and directed by Art Leonardi. The original tagline on posters was 'He's been bombed, blasted and plugged in the parachute... Is this any way to welcome the World's Greatest Detective?'.  Soundtrack  Curse of the Pink Panther saw a delayed soundtrack album release of 27 years. The limited edition soundtrack album was released by Quartet Records in 2010, which included 23 tracks and five additional bonus tracks. # Main Title (5:13) # Operation Paragon (1:17) # Sabotage (1:06) # Looking for a New Clouseau (0:46) # Clifton Sleigh Theme (3:38) # Mafia Lunch (1:04) # Airport Attempts (0:59) # Museum Clouseau (2:52) # The Mechanic Dog (0:14) # Arrival at Liton's Chateau (1:15) # Car Chase (0:35) # On a Terrace with a Doll I (3:12) # On a Terrace with a Doll II (3:07) # Piano Source (1:54) # Mr. Chong (1:06) # Arrival in Valencia (3:46) # Las Fallas I (2:17) # Las Fallas II (1:54) # Caf√© Ol√© (3:26) # Street Fighters (1:49) # Something for Clifton (4:13) # Up in the Air (2:13) # End Titles (3:54) # Main Title (Alternate) (5:12) # Operation Paragon (Alternate) (1:16) # Arrival in Valencia (Instrumental) (2:30) # Caf√© Ol√© (Alternate) (2:46) # Bullfight (0:38) Reception Curse of the Pink Panther received unanimously negative critical reviews and was a box office bomb ‚Äî with the general consensus being that attempting to continue The Pink Panther series without Sellers was a mistake, though some critics and fans thought that one positive aspect of the film was Moore's cameo, which is a humorous departure from his usual role of the suave and sophisticated hero, complete with falls, minced words and an ice bucket for most of his scenes that showed a previously unknown talent for physical and verbal comedy. Both this film and Trail came in $1 million over budget. The problem was the films started shooting in February and were rushed through post-production by October 1982. Trail was a disappointment at the box office. As a result, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer did not release Curse in the spring of 1983 as planned, instead it was pushed back until August with virtually no newspaper or television promotion for the film. This violated Edwards' contract with MGM; he sued the studio for $180 million in September 1983 for \\"willfully sabotaging the film\\". MGM sued Edwards for alleged fraudulent overspending. Shortly after this, Edwards sued MGM for defamation of character. The lawsuits combined totaled over $1 billion. After much legal wrangling, Edwards and MGM settled the various lawsuits out of court in 1988. Wass' option for several sequels was never taken up, though Edwards did start planning what would become Son of the Pink Panther around the time of the settlement ‚Äì but MGM was not interested. They went ahead with a 1989 television movie in 1989, The New Pink Panther. Gary Nelson directed Charlie Schlatter as a nice-guy television reporter investigating an arsonist, and who teams up with the cartoon Panther (who talks) to solve crimes. This Roger Rabbit knock-off never aired. Finally, after much effort, Edwards's Son was released in 1993, starring Roberto Benigni as Clouseau's illegitimate son. However, like this and Trail, it did not do well at the box-office, signalling the end of Edwards' involvement with the franchise for good. Curse of the Pink Panther currently holds a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/curse_of_the_pink_panther MGM produced a commercially successful revival, The Pink Panther (2006), starring Steve Martin as Clouseau, though this film is a reboot of the franchise rather than a continuation or remake. Martin once again played Clouseau in The Pink Panther 2, though that film was not as successful as the first. More than two decades later, Wass would direct co-star Robert Wagner in episodes of Two and a Half Men.

The screenplay by Jack Rose and Mel Shavelson was based upon a story by I. A. L. Diamond. The film was directed by David Butler, produced by Alex Gottlieb and distributed by Warner Bros. It's a Great Feeling was Day's third film (and her third pairing with Carson) and the first to bring her widespread notice. It's a Great Feeling is a \\"Who's Who?\\" of Hollywood in its heyday and glorified the studio system at the peak of its golden age. Plot The film begins with a succession of real-life film directors ‚Äì including Michael Curtiz, King Vidor, Raoul Walsh, and David Butler ‚Äì refusing to helm a new Warner's flick, Mademoiselle Fifi, because Jack Carson has been signed to star in it. Frustrated, fictional studio head Arthur Trent (Bill Goodwin) finally decides to let Carson direct it. Seeking the perfect co-star for himself and fellow lead Dennis Morgan, Carson finds her in the person of studio commissary waitress Judy Adams (Doris Day). Judy has been in Hollywood for three months without even one audition, and sneaks her way into Carson's office, where she forces him to give her a chance. A self-proclaimed liar, Carson advises her to pose as his secret bride to Morgan. Fooled at first, Morgan eventually catches on to the ruse. Following an angry outburst, Judy leaves the studio, feeling used by the two actors for their entertainment. Moving on, Carson continues his search for his romantic interest in the film, but nobody seems to be willing to work with him. When Jane Wyman is offered the role, she even faints. Dennis suggests to Carson that he should cast an unknown, because only outsiders are unaware of his image and would be willing to work with him. Judy is the first person that comes to their mind, though they do not know that ‚Äì because of them ‚Äì Judy has become disillusioned by Hollywood and is set to return to her home town, Goerke's Corners, Wisconsin. Both Carson and Morgan want to be the one who has discovered Judy officially, and go their separate ways to convince Judy to return to Warner Brothers and assume the role. Arriving at the station at the same time to stop Judy from leaving, and after running into Danny Kaye, both men succeed in making Judy believe that they will help her get her big break in the movies. Carson and Morgan start by dressing Judy as a film star in order to impress Trent. At a fancy dress shop, Joan Crawford suspects that Judy is being taken advantage of, and condemns both men for it. Carson remembers that Trent likes to discover his own talent, so he dresses Judy in a number of different guises ‚Äì such as an elevator operator, a cab driver and an oculist's assistant ‚Äì in the hope Trent will see her, appreciate her potential, and insist Carson cast the unknown. Unfortunately, all Trent keeps seeing is a pretty blonde with a goofy smile and blinking eyes. Morgan, having lost all hope, discourages Judy from becoming an actress, but she is now determined to have her big break, explaining the hard work she has done to afford acting and singing lessons, as well as moving to Hollywood. By this time, both men are now not only fighting over discovering Judy, but also for her romantic attention. Carson and Morgan attempt to arrange a screen test for Judy, and continue their schemes in order to impress her. They are stopped at the studio, but Edward G. Robinson helps them sneak in. In the studio, they arrange for Judy to perform the song \\"That Was a Big Fat Lie\\" on camera directed by a reluctant Ray Heindorf. The screen test undergoes technical difficulties, which startles Trent when seeing it, and, coming on top of his \\"visions\\" of the same face everywhere (when Carson and Morgan planted Judy all around him), results in a nervous breakdown and a cancellation of production of Mademoiselle Fifi. As a final attempt, Carson and Morgan conspire to disguise Judy as a famous French film star with dark hair named Yvonne Amour ‚Äì and an inaccurate accent ‚Äì but Trent still manages to recognize her despite the great amount of attention that \\"Yvonne\\" is receiving, including a meeting with Eleanor Parker and Patricia Neal and a performance of the song \\"At the Cafe Rendezvous\\". Upset with all the backstage shenanigans she's been forced to endure, Judy considers returning home to Goerkes Corners to marry long-time sweetheart Jeffrey Bushdinkle. Carson and Morgan consider stopping her, but Judy's friend Grace (Claire Carleton) makes them realize that she will be much happier with her fianc√© in a small town than an uncertain career in Hollywood, and they step back. Judy overhears them promising another girl a career in the pictures, confirming her doubt of having been used by the actors. She leaves in tears and coincidentally shares the train with Trent. Now realizing her talent, Trent offers Judy a career in pictures, but she thinks he is lying as well and rejects him. Nonetheless, Trent announces that the film is back in production with Judy Adams as the only contender for the lead role. Carson and Morgan rush to Goerkes Corners to share the news with Judy, but realize that they have to interfere with her wedding, and decide to leave to let Judy lead a small town life. Their curiosity as to what her fianc√© has to attract her so strongly is satisfied when his face is revealed to be that of Errol Flynn.

The film resembled Day's early career as a waitress struggling to get into the pictures and nearly landing her big break when prepared to leave Hollywood. It's a Great Feeling was Day's third film and third-to-last collaboration with Carson. On working with him, Day wrote in her autobiography: In June 1948, Day's participation in the film was confirmed. By the time, Carson and Morgan were already cast.\\"Doris Day Is Featuring Star of Warner Pictures\\" by Bob Thomas. The Evening Independent, June 15, 1948. p. 16 By the time, the film also went under the title Two Guys of the Nineties and, due to insistence of Carson and Morgan as Two Guys from Hollywood (though Morgan had previously stated in an interview that he would never star in another film with \\"Two Guys\\" in the title).\\"Laraine Day In A Stew; She Dislikes Newsmen\\" by Hedda Hopper.

The Films of Joan Crawford. The Citadel Press, 1968. In his book on Doris Day's career, author Tom Santopietro writes that the Crawford's self-parody of her \\"notoriously dramatic\\" screen image is the funniest bit in the film. Crawford supposedly overhears Jack Carson and Dennis Morgan discussing Doris Day and thinks they are taking advantage of her. She automatically launches into a clich√©d, melodramatic speech typical of her screen persona (in this case, from Mildred Pierce) and furiously slaps both Jack Carson and Dennis Morgan. Carson asks \\"What's that for?\\" and Crawford smiles, shrugs and says: \\"I do that in all my pictures!\\" =Box Office= According to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,059,000 domestically and $654,000 in overseas markets. Awards and nominations The title tune \\"It's a Great Feeling\\" (written by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn), received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song.

Political scientists Brian Lai and Dan Slater identify strongman rule as a form of authoritarian rule characterized by autocratic military dictatorships, as distinct from three other categories of authoritarian rule, specifically machine (oligarchic party dictatorships); bossism (autocratic party dictatorships), and juntas (oligarchic military dictatorships). A 2014 study published in the Annual Review of Political Science journal found that strongmen and juntas are both more likely to engage in human rights violations and civil wars than civilian dictatorships. However, military strongmen are more belligerent than military regimes or civilian dictatorships--i.e., they are more likely to initiate interstate armed conflict. It is theorized that this is because strongmen have greater reason to fear assassination, imprisonment, or exile after being removed from power. The rule of military strongmen is more likely to end through an insurgency, popular uprising, or invasion; by contrast, the rule of military regimes and civilian dictatorships are more likely to end in democratization. Authoritarian leaders classified by political scientists as strongmen include Chiang Kai-shek (Republic of China), Fidel Castro (Cuba), Ioannis Metaxas (Greece), Juan Domingo Per√≥n (Argentina), Gamal Abdel Nasser (Egypt), Ayub Khan (Pakistan), Salah Jadid (Syria), Hafez al-Assad (Syria), Siad Barre (Somalia), and Idi Amin (Uganda),Jessica L.

It is named after Michael Young, the British sociologist and social activist who created over 60 organisations including the Open University, Which?, Economic and Social Research Council, the School for Social Entrepreneurs, and Language Line.Gavron and Dench,eds, Young at 80, Carcanet, London, 1995 History The Young Foundation The Institute for Community Studies (ICS) was set up by Michael Young in 1954. The ICS was an urban studies think tank which combined academic research and practical social innovation. In 2005, it merged with the Mutual Aid Centre and was renamed The Young Foundation, in honour of its founder, Michael Young. In both current and previous incarnations, The Young Foundation has been instrumental in leading research, driving public debate, and implementing social innovation in the UK and abroad, with an emphasis on combining research and practical application. The Young Foundation is still based in Bethnal Green, where the ICS started. During the second half of the 20th century Michael Young was one of the world‚Äôs most creative and influential social thinkers and doers. After 1945 he helped shape the UK‚Äôs new welfare state. In the early 1950s he set up the Institute of Community Studies and used it as a base for research and action. Together with collaborators including Peter Willmott, Peter Townsend and many others, he wrote a series of bestsellers which changed attitudes to a host of social issues, including urban planning (leading the movement away from tower blocks), education (leading thinking about how to radically widen access) and poverty. Young pioneered ideas of public and consumer empowerment both in private markets and in public services, some of which are only now becoming mainstream (for example NHS Direct, the spread of after-school clubs and neighbourhood councils can all be traced to his work). One of his books coined the term ‚Äòmeritocracy‚Äô. Another radically rethought the role of the family. Young's greatest legacy was institution building. He initiated, and in some cases directly created, dozens of new institutions including: Open University, Which?, International Alert, University of the Third Age, Economic and Social Research Council, National Extension College, National Consumer Council, Open College of the Arts and School for Social Entrepreneurs.

The 1980 film Urban Cowboy sparked a renewed interest in the dance. In 1985, The Moody Brothers' version of the song received a Grammy Award nomination for \\"Best Country Instrumental Performance\\". Irish group The Chieftains received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Country Vocal Collaboration\\" for their version of the song with lead vocals by Ricky Skaggs on their 1992 album Another Country. In 1994 a version of the song recorded by the Swedish band Rednex as \\"Cotton Eye Joe\\" became popular worldwide. History = 19th century = The origins of this song are unclear, although it pre-dates the 1861‚Äì1865 American Civil War.Everett, Holly: \\"The Many Lives of ‚ÄòCotton Eyed Joe‚Äô\\", Canadian Society for Traditional Music Conference, 2002, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland. American folklorist Dorothy Scarborough (1878‚Äì1935) noted in her 1925 book On the Trail of Negro Folk-songs, that several people remembered hearing the song before the war. Scarborough's account of the song came from her sister, Mrs. George Scarborough, who learned the song from \\"the Negroes on a plantation in Texas, and other parts from a man in Louisiana\\". The man in Louisiana knew the song from his earliest childhood and heard slaves singing it on plantations. Both the dance and the song had many variants.Lloyd Shaw, The Round Dance Book, The Caxton Printers, Ltd, 1948, p. 314. No ISBN or catalogue number. American publishing house Harper and Brothers published the first printed version of the song in 1882. It was heard by author Louise Clarke Pyrnelle (born 1850) on the Alabama plantation of her father when she was a child. That 1882 version was republished as follows in 1910: > Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe, What did make you sarve me so, Fur ter > take my gal erway fum me, An' cyar her plum ter Tennessee?

By 1884, the same year Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was published, the fiddle-based song was referred to as \\"an old, familiar air\\". In 1925, another version was recorded by folklorist Dorothy Scarborough and published. > Don't you remember, don't you know, Don't you remember Cotton-eyed Joe? > Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe, What did make you treat me so?

Scarborough noted that the song seemed to be well known in the South prior to the Civil War, and parts of it had been sent in by various persons. Over the years, many different versions of the song have been performed and/or recorded with many different versions of the lyrics (and many without lyrics). \\"Cotton- Eyed Joe\\", on occasion referred to as \\"The South Texas National Anthem\\", was played for minstrel-type jigs, and it has long been popular as a square dance hoedown and a couple dance polka.Dance Across Texas Betty Casey, University of Texas Press, 1985, p. 17. A resident of Central Texas who learned the dance in Williamson County in the early 1880s described it as nothing but a heel and toe \\"poker\\" with fringes added. These fringes added to the heel and toe polka were clog steps which required skill and extraversion on the part of the dancer.Harris, Pittman, Waller, Dance a While. Handbook of Folk, Square, and Social Dancing. 1950, 1955, 1964, 1968. Burgess Publishing Company, Fourth Edition, p. 151. = 20th century = \\"Cotton Eye Joe\\", performed by Gid Tanner and his Skillet Lickers (1929). During the first half of the 20th century, the song was a widely known folk song all over English-speaking North America. One discography lists 134 recorded versions released since 1950. In more recent decades, the song has waned in popularity in most regions except some parts of the American South, where it is still a popular folk song.Everett, 2002 A list of the possible meanings of the term \\"cotton-eyed\\" that have been proposed includes: to be drunk on moonshine, or to have been blinded by drinking wood alcohol, turning the eyes milky white; a Black person with very light blue eyes; someone whose eyes were milky white from bacterial infections of trachoma or syphilis, cataracts or glaucoma; or the contrast of dark skin tone around white eyeballs in black people. Bob Wills and Adolph Hofner and his San Antonians both recorded the song, and Hofner's version (Columbia 37658), issued in 1941, apparently was the one that did the most to popularize the song.Bill C. Malone, Don't Get above Your Raisin‚Ä≤, University of Illinois Press, 2001, p. 313. A 1967 instrumental version of the song (KIKR k202) by Al Dean, who recalled the song called \\"The Gingerbread Man\\" in South Texas, inspired a new round dance polka for couples. This dance was adapted into a simplified version as a nonpartner waist-hold, spoke line routine. Heel and toe polka steps were replaced with a cross-lift followed by a kick with two-steps. The lift and kick are sometimes accompanied by shouts of \\"whoops, whoops\\", or the barnyard term \\"bull shit\\", mimicking the act of kicking off barnyard muck. The practice continues to this day. The Kickin‚Ä≤ album included \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" by Dean. (KIK-R: 10012) One version of a dance called \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" can be found in the 1975 edition of Encyclopedia of Social Dance. This version has the men on the inside of a circle facing out, and the women on the outside facing in. The dance consists of eight kick steps, side, close left together, right together, and a series of struts.Albert and Josephine Bulter, Encyclopedia of Social Dance, New York: Albert Bulter Ballroom Dance Service. New York, New York, 1975. In Finland the song is commonly used as the music for a dance called \\"Teksasin ruusu\\" in Vanhojen Tanssit. The spoke line version gained popularity not only in Texas, but also across the US and overseas. in the 1980s. Ray Benson of the Western Swing band Asleep at the Wheel talks about playing the Bob Wills version of \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" in Texas in the 1970s when the dance was very much alive. A Western \\"craze\\" followed the 1980 release of Urban Cowboy. \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\", and its continued popularity in Texas, was referred to in the lyrics to Alabama's song \\"If You're Gonna Play in Texas\\". \\"I remember down in Houston we were puttin' on a show when a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled, 'Cotton- Eyed Joe'!\\" In Merle Haggard's \\"Texas Fiddle Song\\", the final verse makes reference to the \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" and features the melody of both the Bob Wills and Al Dean versions. The song has become a staple song played at many professional and college baseball games during the seventh-inning stretch with the preference going to the Rednex version.

Unlike other RAF ranks which officers may hold in an acting capacity, acting pilot officer is maintained as a separate grade. It normally denotes an officer who has recently been commissioned and joined as a non-graduate direct entrant. Acting pilot officer is not an actual rank, and A/Plt Off's are later regraded to pilot officer, not promoted. Although acting pilot officer has a NATO ranking code of OF(D), neither the British Army, Royal Marines nor Royal Navy has an exactly equivalent rank. As acting pilot officers are junior to second lieutenants in the British Army or the Royal Marines and to Royal Navy midshipmen, the rank is the most junior commissioned rank in the British Armed Forces. On a University Air Squadron, students can apply for the position of acting pilot officer in order to undertake a Senior Student or Flight Commander role, usually four per each UAS. In order to be awarded a Volunteer Reserve commission they have to complete an intensive course run by the Officer and Aircrew Cadet Training Unit at RAFC Cranwell. On graduation, RAFVR Acting Pilot Officers hold a full commission for one year. This can be extended if serving for more than one year in a senior position on squadron or retained if serving the RAF reserves. Up to 2012, 3 Flying Training School (3FTS) were responsible for the training of UAS APOs. However starting in 2013 OACTU took over the duties of training APOs with a course aligned with the commissioning course of the RAF reserves. The rank insignia is identical to that of a pilot officer, consisting of a thin blue band on slightly wider black band.

In the 19th century, the term strongman referred to an exhibitor of strength or similar circus performers who performed feats of strength. More recently, strength athletics, also known as strongman competitions, have grown in popularity. These competitions are now composed of a variety of events in which competitors have to move the highest weights possible, the winner being the one having the highest tally across all events. Description In the past, strongmen would perform various feats of strength such as the bent press (not to be confused with the bench press, which did not exist at the time), supporting large amounts of weight held overhead at arm's length, steel bending, chain breaking, etc. Large amounts of wrist, hand, and tendon strength were required for these feats, as well as prodigious oblique strength. In the late 20th century the term strongman evolved to describe one who competes in strength athletics ‚Äì a more modern eclectic strength competition in which competitors display their raw functional strength through exercises such as lifting rocks, toting refrigerators, pulling trains, towing an eighteen-wheel truck behind them, etc. The most famous competitions of this type are the World's Strongest Man, the Arnold Strongman Classic, the Strongman Champions League and the Giants Live tour, however many countries hold national-level competitions. In recent years, interest in the sport at the grassroots level has skyrocketed, leading to the spontaneous formation of local clubs, loosely affiliated with provincial/state and national associations. Many sports-specific training facilities have begun to incorporate movements associated with strongman competitions into their general training schemes, albeit with lighter weights used, e.g. tyre flips, sled drags, object loading or carrying, log pressing, farmer's walks and so on. Training Training for strongman involves building overall strength in the gym and training with competition implements to gain familiarity. In the gym, it is necessary to train the entire body for strength, especially with variants of the squat, deadlift, and overhead press. Also important is explosive power, developed by weightlifting-style lifts, and cardiovascular conditioning. Grip strength must also be developed. Although you can do general strength training, at a typical gym, training with a strongman regimen requires equipment not typically found in a gym. Some equipment used in a strongman competition would have to be found custom-made or at a strongman gym. These equipment include Atlas Stone, Log (Log Press), Farmers Walk Bars, Yoke (Yoke Walk), Keg (Keg Toss), a vehicle. Another part of a strongman's training is its intense diet regime. A top athlete in strongman would need to ingest upwards of 10,000 calories a day. Events Though competitive strongman events are ever changing, there are a number of staples that frequently appear on the international stage, including: Incorrect usage Strongman is often incorrectly used to describe a person who does weightlifting or bodybuilding. Due to the circus and entertainment background, nineteenth-century bodybuilders were expected to mingle with the crowd during intermission and perform strength feats like card tearing, nail bending, etc. to demonstrate strength as well as symmetry and size. Also, many strongmen sold photos of themselves nude or near-nude, flexing and posing. Although, what they considered the epitome of male beauty was different from modern ideals ‚Äì particularly the very low emphasis on chest size, and great emphasis on oblique size, and symmetry as evidenced by photos of Eugen Sandow.

She is also a character in the modern Astro Boy animated series. Phoenix Robita first appears (in the chronological order of the manga release) in Future, where he is a grey cylindrical robot with an ellipsoid head, the eyes being a slit and his arms being articulated with claws. He is an assistant to an old recluse mad scientist called Dr. Saruta, the last descendant of the Sarutas in the Phoenix continuity. Although Robita may only be a robot, he shows signs of personality and kindness, which even astonishes Saruta himself. In the Resurrection episode, the origins of Robita have been revealed. He is actually the combined minds of Leon, a human, and Chihiro, a robot, who have been loaded up into an android by Dr. Weekday, a mad scientist who worked for an organ-smuggling crime ring. Leon, a young man who died in a rigged car accident, is surgically resurrected with artificial brain implants. The side effect of these new organs changes the way he perceives the world: he ses, hears and feels humans and other living things as repulsive and intimidating jumbles of rocks. His mind having become closer to a robot's than a human, he sees machines and robots as beauties and marvels of nature. This is how he meets Chihiro, a factory worker robot. Although \\"she\\" normally looks like an ugly and cold insect-like automaton, Leon considers her as a beautiful and charming young girl wearing an antennae hat. He falls in love which she reciprocates, but their love is forbidden, the company not wanting to let go of Chihiro. After Leon finds out his death was ordered by some of his relatives because he hunted the Phoenix and got its much-coveted blood, he runs away with her and reaches an organ-smuggling crime headquarters. The female leader of the operations falls in love with Leon, who rejects her, and she decides to forcefully combine her body with his by surgery of a mad scientist working for her, Dr. Weekday. After a last request by Leon on Weekday, he agrees to load his mind into Chihiro... but the girl- robot does not have enough memory space in her body. Weekday combines them into a bigger robot. Leon-Chihiro gradually forgets his/her memories and runs away, being taken in by a family, who enjoys his/her gentleness, knowledge of human games and trustworthiness. Leon-Chihiro is then copied and mass-produced worldwide, as popular household and nanny robots. His/her new name is Robita. Yet, one day, a boy is accidentally killed by radiation inside an isotope field. His parents, not wanting to take responsibility for the accident, blame Robita. After a long trial, Robita and the Robitas working in the field are found guilty and ordered to be destroyed. All the other Robitas around the world decide to also destroy themselves upon learning the news, and go into collective suicide. Only one Robita remains, one working on the Moon for Acetylene Lamp, a space transport officer. Robita tells him he feels human, and is sure about that. Lamp, revolted by a robot having such idea, tells him that he couldn't be unless he proved himself, such as killing him for treating him like a slave. Robita does so, in an indirect way, and is left alone on the moon, crying over his guilt, until he is found one day by wandering scientist Dr. Saruta, who takes him under his wing as his assistant. Robita serves Saruta as his trustworthy assistant for decades, until he is shot and destroyed by Rock. Astro Boy =1980 series= Robita played a very minor role in the episode \\"Save the Carolina 3\\" of the 1980 series as a domestic robot working at a space station. =2003 series= Robita's character, known as Nora in the English version, has been reused for the 2003 anime series of Astro Boy. The robot keeps his cylindrical body and ellipsoid head, but is given a less dark and more cartoonish look: yellow color, telescopic arms and green bubbly eyes. The character also saw a change in gender, being referred to as 'she'. Her role is major, yet passive, throughout the series. She is generally shown to be a source of information, added to show a sense of family in the household, or even as comic relief. She appeared in the videogame Astro Boy. Trivia The protagonist of Saya no Uta shared very similar fate with Leon/Robita.

Designed by Len Terry,Setright, L.J.K., \\"Lotus: The Golden Mean\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11, p. 1227. it was built in response to the Lola Mk1 which was dominant against the previous Lotus model, the Eleven. It was replaced in 1960 by the Lotus 19. The Lotus 17 was Chapman's answer to the Lola Mk 1, which by late 1958, was beating the venerable (but by then a good few years old) Eleven with monotonous regularity. The Lola was smaller and lighter than the Eleven, and so Chapman's riposte was even smaller, even lighter, even more aerodynamic. It was designed by Len Terry based on Chapman's ideas and it incorporated a number of new features, although in fact was the last front-engined sports racing car Lotus made. Its rear suspension was the Chapman strut, first used on the single seat Lotus Twelve, the Elite Coupe and the Lotus 15. Its front suspension was novel for a sport-racing car as it used the Chapman-modified MacPherson strut suspension first seen on the Ford Consul in 1952, and was very light. It was Lotus's first glass fibre-bodied sports racing car (although the Works Elevens had fibreglass bodies in 1958), had a very low frontal area and the lightest weight of any multi-seat production Lotus ever made. The declared (albeit dry) weight was 340 kg (17s nowadays struggle to get below a wet 400 kg). It should have been a very effective weapon. But at its first race in early April 1959, it became apparent that the handling was flawed, with the front struts bending and binding under racing loads. By the time the problem had been identified and rectified by the substitution of the front struts by more conventional wishbones (which was subsequently offered as a factory modification to all 17 owners), it was all too late and racing had moved on. Only 21 cars were actually produced. Of these, about a dozen exist today, and it is only now, in modern historic racing where two cars race in Europe and two in the US, that their potential is being realised. Rear view of Lotus 17 Engine-wise, 17s ran in period with all the small capacity Coventry Climax options, 742 cc FWMA (as in the works 1959 Le Mans entries, which were going very well in class until electrical problems forced their retirement), 1,098 cc FWA (the normal small capacity racing class of the day), 1,216 cc FWE and (in North America) 1460cc. Nowadays, they usually run with the 1,216 cc FWE engine, although the US cars now usually run with the 1460 cc FWB.

The film was produced by Aaron Spelling and Alan Greisman, and executive produced by Herbert Ross. The film tells a backstage story of the cast and crew of a popular fictional television soap opera. It stars Sally Field as a mature soap star, joined by Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr., Elisabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty, Garry Marshall, Kathy Najimy, and Carrie Fisher, as well as cameo appearances by TV personalities like Leeza Gibbons, John Tesh (both playing themselves as Entertainment Tonight hosts/reporters), real-life soap opera actors Stephen Nichols and Finola Hughes. The film received generally positive reviews. Kline was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Plot Celeste Talbert, the long-time star of the embattled daytime drama The Sun Also Sets, is targeted by her ambitious co-star Montana Moorehead; Montana connives to supplant Celeste as the show's star by promising sexual favors to its producer, David Seton Barnes. To make the audience hate Celeste's character, Montana and David come up with a last-minute plot change in which she will accidentally kill a young, destitute deaf-mute, played by the newly-cast Lori Craven. Despite the strong objections of head writer Rose Schwartz and Celeste herself, the scene plays out, but is interrupted by Celeste's recognition of Lori as her real-life niece. Network honcho Edmund Edwards sees potential in the relationship and makes Lori a regular cast member, hoping to boost the show's flagging ratings. Montana and David seek to further unnerve Celeste by bringing back Jeffrey Anderson, an actor whom Celeste arranged to be fired from The Sun Also Sets decades before, after his romantic relationship with Celeste went sour. Bitter at being reduced to performing dinner theater for uninterested seniors in Florida, Jeffrey relishes the chance to needle Celeste. Outwardly despising Jeffrey but perhaps still harboring some feelings for him, Celeste becomes unhinged when Jeffrey and Lori seem to be about to begin a romantic relationship, seemingly from jealousy. However, when Lori and Jeffrey are about to enact a scripted onscreen kiss, Celeste stops them by revealing that Lori is actually her daughter by Jeffrey. On camera, Celeste explains that she was responsible for getting Jeffrey fired because she was distraught about the pregnancy. Then she went home, passed Lori off as her niece, and had her parents raise Lori, all due to pressure from the network. This incites disgust and scorn from nearly everyone on the show towards Celeste, but the scandal ignites renewed interest in the show, causing the ratings to skyrocket. A board meeting between the show's staff‚Äîincluding Rose, who speaks out in Celeste's defense‚Äîtakes place thereafter, where David insists that she be fired, but he is quickly overruled as the situation has not only resulted in positive press for the show, but has generated a great deal of public sympathy for Celeste. The next day, after an unpleasant exchange with Lori, Celeste goes to Jeffrey and pleads with him to speak to Lori on her behalf. Jeffrey is resistant at first, but after Celeste gives him advice on how to approach her and break the ice, the conversation leads to Celeste and Jeffrey embracing. Just when it seems the two are about to reconcile, Montana interrupts them and claims that she and Jeffrey slept together the previous night. Disgusted, Celeste storms off, leaving the situation between her and Jeffrey even worse than before. The dilemma is further inflamed when Rose‚Äîwho by now is no longer angry with Celeste‚Äîshows her a tabloid newspaper proclaiming that Montana is pregnant with Jeffrey's child. After an explosive exchange between the three of them takes place over this, Celeste, Jeffrey and Lori go to the head of the network with their concerns and demand that some action must be taken to solve the problem. But it's Lori who delivers the ultimatum, stating: \\"Mr. Edwards-- it's them or me--that is the bottom line here! They go or I go!\\" A decision is made by the network, and the actors head into a live episode still not knowing who will be written off the show. They will read their lines from a teleprompter so that the secret will be kept until the last minute. It is revealed that Lori's character has \\"brain fever\\" and will die; still hoping to be rid of Celeste, Montana ad-libs and suggests that a brain transplant can save her. Lori is shocked by the revelation, but in character, Celeste immediately plays along, offering her own brain for the operation. Touched by the sacrifice, Lori asks Celeste and Jeffrey not to leave the show, and softens to her newfound parents. Montana, desperate to stop them, reiterates that she is pregnant with Jeffrey's child, but she is publicly ruined by Rose who, with the help of vengeful Ariel Maloney, who wanted Jeffrey for herself, reveals the secret from a high school yearbook that Montana is actually a transsexual formerly called \\"Milton Moorehead, of Syosset, Long Island.\\" David is shocked and Montana flees the set, screaming in horror. Later, Celeste, Jeffrey, and Lori win soap opera awards while Montana is relegated to performing dinner theater at Jeffrey's former venue.

The effect is named for a Dutch brand of cocoa, with an image designed by Jan Misset in 1904. It has since been used in the packaging of a variety of products. The effect was anticipated in medieval works of art such as Giotto's Stefaneschi Triptych of 1320. Effect =Origins= Detail from the 1320 Stefaneschi Triptych showing Cardinal Stefaneschi holding the triptych itself The effect is named after the image on the tins and boxes of Droste cocoa powder, one of the main Dutch brands, which displayed a nurse carrying a serving tray with a cup of hot chocolate and a box with the same image, designed by Jan Misset.T√∂rnqvist, Egil. Ibsen: A Doll's House, pp.105, Cambridge University Press (1995) This image, introduced in 1904, and maintained for decades with slight variations from 1912 by artists including Adolphe Mouron, became a household notion. Reportedly, poet and columnist Nico Scheepmaker introduced wider usage of the term in the late 1970s. =Mathematics= The appearance is recursive: the smaller version contains an even smaller version of the picture, and so on. Only in theory could this go on forever, as fractals do; practically, it continues only as long as the resolution of the picture allows, which is relatively short, since each iteration geometrically reduces the picture's size. =Medieval art= The Droste effect was anticipated by Giotto in 1320, in his Stefaneschi Triptych. The polyptych altarpiece portrays in its center panel Cardinal Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi offering the triptych itself to St. Peter. There are also several examples from medieval times of books featuring images containing the book itself or window panels in churches depicting miniature copies of the window panel itself.See the collection of articles for examples and opinions on how this effect was used symbolically. =M. C. Escher= The Dutch artist M. C. Escher made use of the Droste effect in his 1956 lithograph Print Gallery, which depicts a gallery containing a print which depicts the gallery, each time both reduced and rotated, but with a void at the centre of the image. The work has attracted the attention of mathematicians including Bart de Smit and Hendrik Lenstra. They devised a method of filling in the artwork's central void in an additional application of the Droste effect by successively rotating and shrinking an image of the artwork. =Modern usage= The Droste effect was used in the packaging of Land O'Lakes butter, which featured a Native American woman holding a package of butter with a picture of herself. Morton Salt similarly makes use of the effect. The cover of the 1969 vinyl album Ummagumma by Pink Floyd shows the band members sitting in various places, with a picture on the wall showing the same scene, but the order of the band members rotated. The logo of The Laughing Cow cheese spread brand pictures a cow with earrings. On closer inspection, these are seen to be images of the circular cheese spread package, each bearing the image of the laughing cow. The Droste effect is a theme in Russell Hoban's children's novel, The Mouse and His Child, appearing in the form of a label on a can of \\"Bonzo Dog Food\\" which depicts itself. A three- dimensional example of the Droste Effect can be seen in Bourton-on-the-Water, England. A model of Burton-on-the-Water was built within the village in the 1930s at a 1:9 scale and contains within it a model of itself, which in turn includes a further smaller model, and then an even smaller model within that. The model village was awarded Grade II listed status in 2013 in recognition of its uniquely precise details and the genuine building materials and methods used, which replicate those used in the construction of the life-size village.

He batted and threw right-handed. A native of Mesquite, Texas, Cunningham played briefly for the Cardinals at third base before an injury cut short his career. He injured himself, whipping a sidearm throw to first base on a swinging bunt. Life Cunningham was a 26-year-old rookie when he joined the Cardinals for the final weeks of the 1931 season. His salary was $500 a year. During his time with St. Louis, Cunningham roomed with two Cardinal legends, Dizzy Dean and Pepper Martin. In a two-season career, Cunningham was a .154 hitter with one RBI and no home runs in 14 games. Following his retirement as a player, Cunningham worked as a salesman and for an oil company. In 2004, he was recognized as the oldest living former Major League Baseball player. He gained this distinction when a former pitcher for the old Washington Senators and St. Louis Browns, Paul Hopkins, died in 2004 at 99 years of age. Cunningham was honored at the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame with a special plaque celebrating his life in baseball. He remained a baseball fan and kept a daily watch on the Houston Astros. Cunningham died in Pearland, Texas at 100 years of age. With his death, the distinction of oldest living former major league player moved to Howdy Groskloss.

Originally written in English, it has been done in several styles and tempos. The very first known recorded version was released in 1951, by Roy Hogsed. The \\"original\\" version, recorded by Teresa Brewer with Orchestra directed by Ray Bloch on January 10, 1952, was released by Coral Records as catalog number 60676 on April 5, 1952. It reached number 25 on the Billboard charts. It was done in a \\"Swing\\" style, with big band backing (including mouth harp). Patience and Prudence had more success with the song when they recorded it in 1956 reaching number 11 on the chart. This is considered the benchmark version, by which all others are judged, due to the intimate harmony of the two young singers. This version brightened the melody somewhat, and later artists followed the brighter version, as did Brewer when she recorded an album version in 1964 in a semi-Caribbean style. Two other versions hit the US chart in 1964 as sung by Tracey Dey (peaking at number 51) and Skeeter Davis (peaking at number 48). Dey's version was done in a style emulating the Wall of Sound, which was popular with girl groups at the time. Davis' version reached the Top 10 on Country charts, and is considered by oldies enthusiasts to be \\"the\\" cover version. Where the Patience and Prudence version has an orchestral backing, the Davis version has a pop band backing of electronic organ, bass and drums, with violin and backup singers. Cover versions In addition to the hit versions of the 1960s, the song has been recorded by: *The Bell Sisters in 1956, using the alternate title \\"Boom Boom, My Honey\\" on the Bermuda Records label, with a simple, slightly Calypso arrangement and Jamaican accents. *Chet Atkins on his 1968 LP Solo Flights *Skeeter Davis, in 1964 and again in 1971 *Tracey Dey, in 1964 *The Vibrations (1966), who did a funk-style version *Trini Lopez (U.S. #93, 1967) *Brent Dowe and The Melodians (1967), who recorded the rocksteady version produced by Duke Reid. *Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams, who recorded a version on their 1976 novelty LP, Laverne & Shirley Sing. *Viola Wills (1979), doing a version in \\"disco\\" or \\"dance\\" style, with a slower tempo and heavy electronic instrumental backing.

Through his father, he is a grandson of president Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, and through his mother, he is related to the prominent du Pont family. Family Roosevelt was the first child born to Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. and his first wife, Ethel du Pont. He was born during his paternal grandfather Franklin D. Roosevelt's second term as president and was his eighth grandchild to be born. After his birth, his father said, \\"'Battling' Frank III is a beautiful baby.\\" He has a younger brother, Christopher du Pont Roosevelt, born 1941, also from his parents' marriage. From his father's later marriages (who married 5 times in total), he has two younger half-sisters, Nancy Suzanne Roosevelt (born 1952) and Laura Delano Roosevelt (born 1959), and a younger half-brother, John Alexander Roosevelt (born 1977). He also had a younger half-brother, Benjamin S. Warren III (born 1954), from his mother's later marriage to attorney Benjamin S. Warren, Jr. Education and career After graduating from St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, Frank Roosevelt received his Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Yale University in 1961, his master's degree from Columbia University in 1968, and his Ph.D. from The New School. Frank Roosevelt with his mother, Ethel du Pont, and FDR at the White House, Christmas 1941 His dissertation was entitled Towards a Marxist Critique of the Cambridge School. His work primarily focused on combining Marxism and capitalism in an attempt to make modern economic systems more \\"fair\\" and less prone to the \\"winner takes all\\" scenario. In 1977, he became a professor at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, where he was chair of the social sciences faculty from 1988 to 1990 and from 1991 to 1993. In retirement, he continued to speak about his grandparents' legacies. He refers to himself as a \\"radical\\" or \\"alternative\\" economist. Rhona Free, one of his former students who is a professor of economics at Eastern Connecticut State University, was named in 2004 one of four U.S. Professors of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. In her acceptance speech, she cited Roosevelt as a significant influence, saying, \\"The most important teacher I ever had was Frank Roosevelt, an economics professor at Sarah Lawrence. He's much more interested in teaching than in testing and in encouraging than in evaluating. In his classes even an average student, as I was, can learn to think critically, express thoughts carefully, and view the world with an open mind.\\" In 2004, the university awarded him the Lipkin Family Prize for Inspirational Teaching. Roosevelt was active in the civil rights movement. During the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Freedom Summer program in Mississippi in 1964, he was arbitrarily arrested by the Mississippi Highway Patrol while driving the civil rights lobbyist Allard K. Lowenstein across the state, but was immediately released when the police realized his identity. Politics and family legacy The Eleanor Roosevelt Monument in Manhattan Roosevelt, who lives in Manhattan, was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Manhattan Country School from 1970 to 2010. In 1981, he led the effort to put the school's tuition system on a sliding scale. Roosevelt led the effort to build a monument to his grandmother Eleanor Roosevelt at Riverside Park in Manhattan. The Eleanor Roosevelt Monument was unveiled in 1996. Roosevelt has written in support of market socialism. Personal life On June 18, 1962, he was married to Grace Rumsey Goodyear, at St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church in Darien, Connecticut. At the time of their wedding, Grace was a graduate of Milton Academy and a student at Smith College. She is the daughter of Austin Goodyear (grandson of Charles W.

It belongs to the archaea domain.See the NCBI webpage on Sulfolobus. Data extracted from the Sulfolobus species grow in volcanic springs with optimal growth occurring at pH 2-3 and temperatures of 75-80 ¬∞C, making them acidophiles and thermophiles respectively. Sulfolobus cells are irregularly shaped and flagellar. Species of Sulfolobus are generally named after the location from which they were first isolated, e.g. Sulfolobus solfataricus was first isolated in the Solfatara volcano. Other species can be found throughout the world in areas of volcanic or geothermal activity, such as geological formations called mud pots, which are also known as solfatare (plural of solfatara). Sulfolobus as a model to study the molecular mechanisms of DNA replication When the first Archaeal genome, Methanococcus jannaschii, had been sequenced completely in 1996, it was found that the genes in the genome of Methanococcus jannaschii involved in DNA replication, transcription, and translation were more related to their counterparts in eukaryotes than to those in other prokaryotes. In 2001, the first genome sequence of Sulfolobus, Sulfolobus solfataricus P2, was published. In P2's genome, the genes related to chromosome replication were likewise found to be more related to those in eukaryotes. These genes include DNA polymerase, primase (including two subunits), MCM, CDC6/ORC1, RPA, RPC, and PCNA. In 2004, the origins of DNA replication of Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius were identified. It showed that both species contained two origins in their genome. This was the first time that more than a single origin of DNA replication had been shown to be used in a prokaryotic cell. The mechanism of DNA replication in archaea is evolutionary conserved, and similar to that of eukaryotes. Sulfolobus is now used as a model to study the molecular mechanisms of DNA replication in Archaea. And because the system of DNA replication in Archaea is much simpler than that in Eukaryota, it was suggested that Archaea could be used as a model to study the much more complex DNA replication in Eukaryota. Role in biotechnology Sulfolobus proteins are of interest for biotechnology and industrial use due to their thermostable nature. One application is the creation of artificial derivatives from S. acidocaldarius proteins, named affitins. Intracellular proteins are not necessarily stable at low pH however, as Sulfolobus species maintain a significant pH gradient across the outer membrane. Sulfolobales are metabolically dependent on sulfur: heterotrophic or autotrophic, their energy comes from the oxidation of sulfur and/or cellular respiration in which sulfur acts as the final electron acceptor. For example, S. tokodaii is known to oxidize hydrogen sulfide to sulfate intracellularly. Genome status The complete genomes have been sequenced for S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 (2,225,959 nucleotides), S. solfataricus P2 (2,992,245 nucleotides), and S. tokodaii str. 7 (2,694,756 nucleotides).  Genome structure  The archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus has a circular chromosome that consists of 2,992,245 bp. Another sequenced species, S. tokodaii has a circular chromosome as well but is slightly smaller with 2,694,756 bp. Both species lack the genes ftsZ and minD, which has been characteristic of sequenced Crenarchaeota. They also code for citrate synthase and two subunits of 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, which plays the same role as alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the TCA (tricarboxylic/Krebs/citric acid) cycle. This indicates that Sulfolobus has a TCA cycle system similar to that found in mitochondria of eukaryotes. Other genes in the respiratory chain which partake in the production of ATP were not similar to what is found in eukaryotes. Cytochrome c is one such example that plays an important role in electron transfer to oxygen in eukaryotes. This was also found in A. pernix K1. Since this step is important for an aerobic microorganism like Sulfolobus, it probably uses a different molecule for the same function or has a different pathway.  Cell structure and metabolism  Sulfolobus can grow either lithoautotrophically by oxidizing sulfur, or chemoheterotrophically using sulfur to oxidize simple reduced carbon compounds. Heterotrophic growth has only been observed, however, in the presence of oxygen. The principle metabolic pathways are a glycolytic pathway, a pentose phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle. All Archaea have lipids with ether links between the head group and side chains, making the lipids more resistant to heat and acidity than bacterial and eukaryotic ester-linked lipids. The Sulfolobales are known for unusual tetraether lipids. In Sulfolobales, the ether-linked lipids are joined covalently across the \\"bilayer,\\" making tetraethers. Technically, therefore, the tetraethers form a monolayer, not a bilayer. The tetraethers help Sulfolobus species survive extreme acid as well as high temperature.  Ecology  S. solfataricus has been found in different areas including Yellowstone National Park, Mount St. Helens, Iceland, Italy, and Russia to name a few. Sulfolobus is located almost wherever there is volcanic activity. They thrive in environments where the temperature is about 80 ¬∞C with a pH at about 3 and sulfur present. Another species, S. tokodaii, has been located in an acidic spa in Beppu Hot Springs, Kyushu, Japan. Sediments from ~90m below the seafloor on the Peruvian continental margin are dominated by intact archaeal tetraethers, and a significant fraction of the community is sedimentary archaea taxonomically linked to the crenarchaeal Sulfolobales (Sturt, et al., 2004). DNA damage response Exposure of Sulfolobus solfataricus or Sulfolobus acidocaldarius to the DNA damaging agents UV-irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C induced cellular aggregation. Other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, did not induce aggregation, suggesting that induction of aggregation is caused specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S. acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Wood et al. also showed that UV-irradiation increased the frequency of recombination due to genetic exchange in S. acidocaldarius. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that the UV- inducible DNA transfer process and subsequent homologous recombinational repair represents an important mechanism to maintain chromosome integrity in S. acidocaldarius and S. solfataricus. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction, similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation that is also associated with DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage. =The ups operon= The ups operon of Sulfolobus species is highly induced by UV irradiation. The pili encoded by this operon are employed in promoting cellular aggregation, which is necessary for subsequent DNA exchange between cells, resulting in homologous recombination. A study of the Sulfolobales acidocaldarius ups operon showed that one of the genes of the operon, saci-1497, encodes an endonuclease III that nicks UV-damaged DNA; and another gene of the operon, saci-1500, encodes a RecQ-like helicase that is able to unwind homologous recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions. It was proposed that Saci-1497 and Saci-1500 function in an homologous recombination-based DNA repair mechanism that uses transferred DNA as a template. Thus it is thought that the ups system in combination with homologous recombination provide a DNA damage response which rescues Sulfolobales from DNA damaging threats. Sulfolobus as a viral host Lysogenic viruses infect Sulfolobus for protection. The viruses cannot survive in the extremely acidic and hot conditions that Sulfolobus lives in, and so the viruses use Sulfolobus as protection against the harsh elements. This relationship allows the virus to replicate inside the archaea without being destroyed by the environment. The Sulfolobus viruses are temperate or permanent lysogens. Permanent lysogens differ from lysogenic bacteriophages in that the host cells are not lysed after the induction of Fuselloviridae production and eventually return to the lysogenic state. They are also unique in the sense that the genes encoding the structural proteins of the virus are constantly transcribed and DNA replication appears to be induced. The viruses infecting archaea like Sulfolobus have to use a strategy to escape prolonged direct exposure to the type of environment their host lives in, which may explain some of their unique properties.

The Canada's Cup is a perpetual trophy awarded to the winner of a sailing match race between a yacht representing a Canadian yacht club and a yacht representing an American yacht club. Aemilius Jarvis sailed for the cup five times, winning the inaugural series in 1896, & repeating in 1901. In 1899 the Toronto Hotel Company was founded by Amelia's Jarvis ‚Äì with the support of George Cox (of Canada Life and the Bank of Commerce) and George Gooderham (of Gooderham & Worts Distillery). Jarvis & his Toronto Hotel Co. built the King Eddy, & it opened in 1903. Edward Aemilius Jarvis (April 25, 1860 - December 19, 1940) was a successful Canadian financier, celebrated equestrian, and champion sailor. Life and career Commodore Aemilius Jarvis at the Griffin Theatre, Thorold; recruiting for the Royal Navy. (1914-18) A member of a prominent Toronto family of Loyalist descent,http://www.ashleynewall.ca/2017/10/aemilius-jarvis-first-world- war.html Jarvis apprenticed as a banker, and eventually became president of the Trader's Bank of Canada. Jarvis founded the Steel Company of Canada. He built Toronto's iconic King Edward Hotel and created the British Columbia Salmon Canning Industry. Jarvis also formed AEmilius Jarvis & Co., earning the friendship and respect of such men as Lord Minto (Governor General of Canada), J.P. Morgan, Sir Thomas Lipton, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Henry Pellatt, and world-champion rower Ned Hanlan. He was the most celebrated yachtsman, and winning-est skipper, on the Great Lakes in his time. Jarvis was instrumental in forming the Royal Canadian Navy during World War I, recruiting both ships and men, & acted as a spy for King George V while visiting Tzar Nicholas of Russia in 1915. He also operated a famously successful stud farm -called Hazelburn- in Aurora, Ontario, breeding hunter-jumper horses. Jarvis' grandson Robert Aemilius Jarvis published the dramatic biography/auto-biography of his grandfather, \\"The Last Viking\\". Legendary yachtsman Jarvis famously sailed alone around Lake Ontario, from Hamilton to Niagara-on-the-Lake to Whitby and back, in a tiny dinghy aptly called Tar Pot when he was just twelve years old. (This journey was reported in newspapers at the time, beginning the legend of the sailor.) Later in life, he spent two years sailing the world in a square- rigger sailing vessel. He designed and built numerous innovative and successful racing sailboats, founded the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club, and was a longtime member of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, of which he was elected commodore seven times. He won the inaugural Canada's Cup yachting race in 1896 sailing the Canada, a 57-foot cutter. Additionally, he won over 100 international freshwater sailing events while at Royal Canadian Yacht Club (& more than 300 overall), including a second Canada's Cup in 1901. Aemilius skippered in every Canada's Cup from 1896-1907 with the sole exception of the 1905 edition; Cup Defenders Rochester Yacht Club made it a stipulation that Jarvis not skipper in order to accept R.C.Y.C.'s challenge. R.C.Y.C.'s Temeraire ultimately lost the 30-foot class match-series to Rochester's Iroquois. As a skipper, Jarvis lived by the credo, \\"A place for everything, & everything in its place,\\" a saying which he took so seriously (for in-race safety reasons) that he was known to throw crew members' items overboard if found laying haphazardly about. He published an account of sailing his yacht, Haswell, from Toronto to the Caribbean in the winter of 1920-21 entitled, \\"5,000 Miles in a 27-Tonner.\\" Ontario bond scandal The yacht Canada (left), skippered by 'Skippadore' Aemilius Jarvis, crosses tacks with Vencedor on Lake Erie, near Toledo, Ohio, in the inaugural 1896 Canada's Cup match- racing series from which Canada emerged victor. Jarvis was convicted on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the government of the Province of Ontario, after having saved that government millions of dollars in the retirement of war bonds. Though he was jailed for six months, for the remainder of his life he stoutly defended his innocence. He'd refused, against all advice, to testify in his own defense, and one theory as to why is that he was shielding/taking a fall for his son, also charged in the affair, after having tragically lost another son previously in World War I. Countless of his high- profile business peers signed a petition detailing the reasoned argument for Jarvis' innocence, which was proven when he at last did take the stand in the trial of another charged in the affair. He was ultimately technically cleared, though not officially by the Ontario Government. The former Premier of Ontario, Ernest C. Drury (United Farmers of Ontario party), labelled him \\"Canada's Dreyfus,\\" a reference to Alfred Dreyfus who was wrongfully charged and jailed in his native France (around the turn of the century) for blatantly political reasons. It seems likely that this scandal is the reason why Aemilius perhaps is not remembered today to the degree that he should be, given his achievements, plus his substantial contributions to Canada's World War I effort.  Military  Aemilius Jarvis recruited ships (incl. anti- submarine), & over 2000 men for Canada's WWI effort. In the 1st year of the war he established a naval recruitment centre in his Toronto office. Jarvis actively supported the Royal Canadian Navy during World War I, recruiting anti-submarine (& other) ships, and over 2000 men. He acted as an unofficial spy for King George V while visiting Russia on business in 1915, delivering a message to George's cousin Tzar Nicholas via an intermediary to encourage Russia to stay in the war, in order to maintain two fronts on Germany. (The intermediary was shortly thereafter assassinated on a train platform immediately following passing -and ignoring- Jarvis in a train-car corridor, with several \\"ugly\\" men following close behind her.) Aemilius was recognized by the Navy League of Canada's award of its unofficial ‚ÄúSpecial Service Decoration‚Äù for his wartime contributions.

In 1899 the Toronto Hotel Company was founded by Aemilius Jarvis ‚Äì with the support of George Cox (of Canada Life and the Bank of Commerce) and George Gooderham (of Gooderham & Worts Distillery). Jarvis & his Toronto Hotel Co. built the King Eddy, & it opened in 1903.
