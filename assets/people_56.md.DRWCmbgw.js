He is a leading archaeologist, studying pyrotechnology and southern Africa.  Education  Chirikure studied for a BA and BA Honours Degrees at the University of Zimbabwe. Subsequently, he studied for a MA in Artefact Studies from the Institute of Archaeology, UCL followed by a PhD in Archaeology. His PhD thesis, received in 2005, was entitled Iron production in Iron Age Zimbabwe: Stagnation or innovation?, supervised by Thilo Rehren and Andrew Reid.  Career  Chirikure is a Professor and previous Head of Department at the Department of Archaeology, University of Cape Town. Chirikure‚Äôs directs the Archaeological Material Laboratory at the University of Cape Town, which studies pyrotechnology as practised by farming communities of the last 2000 years of sub-Saharan Africa. Research undertaken within the laboratory includes the role of mining and metallurgy in early state formation, modelling the evolution of pyrotechnology in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 2000 years, and innovation and demography in the evolution of socio-technical systems. Chirikure studies material from archaeological sites in southern African including Khami, Great Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe, as well as sites in Malawi, Nigeria, and Cameroon. He held a Mandela-Harvard Fellowship in 2012 at Harvard University's Hutchins Centre for African and African American Studies. He received the National Research Foundation of South Africa‚Äôs Presidential Award in 2012 for outstanding research by persons under the age of 40. Chirikure received the Association of Commonwealth Universities Fellowship in 2017, which he held at Linacre College, University of Oxford. He currently holds a British Academy Global Professorship within the School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford, and a Visiting Fellow at St Cross College. Chirikure is also an honorary research associate at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research. In 2019 he delivered the Thirty-first McDonald Annual Lecture at the University of Cambridge. He has published several monographs, including Indigenous Mining and Metallurgy in Africa (2010), and Metals in Past Societies. A Global Perspective on Indigenous African Metallurgy (2015), and numerous journal articles. He is the editor in chief of the Oxford Research Encyclopaedia of African Archaeology and one of the co-editors of Cambridge University Press‚Äô History of Technology book series. Chirikure is a founding member of the South African Young Academy of Science, a member of the Board of Governors for the Arts Council of African Studies Association, and a member of the Advisory Council of the New York based Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. He won the Antiquity prize in both 2019, and in 2008 with Innocent Pikirayi.  Research focus  Much of Chirikure's work is focused on integrating hard sciences with traditional archaeological and anthropological studies, to explore both ancient African technologies and how they contribute to political economies in both non-state and precolonial state systems. Chirikure‚Äôs work seeks to disrupt the hegemonic approach to african technologies, and their roles in society, using African philosophies to revise historically accepted concepts and reflect on the significance of African technology in the long dur√©e. In his work, Chirikure reflects on how this affects Africa's place in the world now, and the place of the world in Africa, as exemplified in a lecture given as part of AfOx insaka 2019, entitled 'Why is contemporary Africa poor: insights from archaeology and deep history'. As of 2020, his current project is focused on the precolonial urban landscapes in southern Africa, and how these deep history of challenges contribute to contemporary society. His work is focused at two World Heritage Sites, Great Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe. Understanding of the economies and social/trade networks of these significant sites is sorely lacking, without even a solid chronological framework. Through an extensive science-based analysis of material and biological remains, Chirikure's work seeks to place these sites in their African and international trade networks. The outcomes will enhance understanding of national heritage and roots through education in Africa and beyond.  Selected publications  Chirikure, S. 2007.

He completed his primary education in Edirne, where his father Miralay H√ºsn√º, an Ottoman Army officer in the rank of Colonel, was stationed. Later, he studied at Ayadofya Middle School and Vefa High School, both in Istanbul. In 1913, he entered \\"Higher School of Fine Arts\\" (), today Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University to study painting.. As the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, he was conscripted at the age of 17. During World War I, he served four years in the military. Following his discharge, he returned to his school, and attended the workshop of ƒ∞brahim √áallƒ± (1882‚Äì1960). In 1928, he graduated from the Academy. He noted that \\"he learned the impressionist painting because √áallƒ± and his colleagues studied in Paris, France, and they were the first painters, who brought this art movement to Turkey\\". Career During his student years, he worked as an archive clerk at a newspaper to earn a living. Starting with ƒ∞leri, he worked later for the dailies ƒ∞kdam, ƒ∞fham, Milliyet, Tan, Son Telgraf and Cumhuriyet, writing articles on arts forty years long. He is considered as a good polemicist. After graduation from the Academy, he was appointed assistant manager at the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum. Later, he became the director of the museum. During this period, he inserted Arabic letters ‚Äîhis name \\"Elif\\" is the first letter of the Arabic alphabet, which was in use in the Ottoman Empire and Turkey until 1928, represents \\"A\\"‚Äî and Turkish motifs into his paintings. He countered to those, who tcritized his art with letters, with \\"painters like Braque, Juan Gris, Picasso, Chagall, Dufy and Klee also placed Latin letters in their works\\". He painted in the art movement of Impressionism. In 1930, he held his first exhibition at the Procession Kiosk. He then took part in exhibitions at exhibitions of the \\"Independent Painters and Sculptors Association\\". In 1933, he cofounded the art movement Group D with four other artists. By October that year, the first exhibition of the Group D painters took place, and it made waves. The group held later 15 exhibitions in the premises of the Halkevi, Academy of Fine Arts and Consulate-General of France, Istanbul until the group's broke up in 1947. In 1939, he took part in the first state exhibition with his portrait of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk (1881‚Äì1938). He served as government commissioner during the archaeological excavations at Aslantepe Tumulus in Malatya. In 1940, he went to Samsun ‚Äîwhere Atat√ºrk had set foot in 1919 to start the Turkish War of Independence, and participated at the second state exhibition with paintings he created there. At a time when theWorld War II intensified, he was conscripted for reserve service in Balƒ±kesir. Commissioned by the Republican People's Party as a painter, he worked in Balƒ±kesir in 1940.

The Indian Ocean borders 24 states, and accounts for a third of the world‚Äôs ocean area. Previously, other challenges, such as Somali piracy, have been at the forefront of international action. However, the utilisation of the Southern route by drug traffickers, and the consequent issues this has caused, has led to increased focus on how to tackle this issue. The Southern Route is becoming increasingly utilised due to a variety of factors. Afghanistan has seen increased poppy yields in recent years, which has led to a greater supply of opioids.McLaughlin p. 25. The corruption and lack of inspection that is rife in East African and Southeast Asian ports, has made them increasingly appealing as trans-shipment destinations. The Southern Route has also become more attractive due to the disruption along traditional land routes, such as the Northern and Balkan routes, due to wars throughout these countries and an increased law enforcement presence.McLaughlin The combination of these elements has encouraged the affected countries to take action against drug traffickers throughout the Indian Ocean. The international nature of the high seas, means they have limited policing capabilities, which makes the oceans particularly vulnerable to the illicit drug trade. Excluding the 12 - 24 nautical miles surrounding each of the littoral states, the oceans are generally not owned by any particular country. Except for in their territorial waters, law enforcement ships can do very little in terms of policing unless a vessel is registered to their own country.McLaughlin p. 26. These problems are heightened by a lack of international agreement and cooperation, resulting in an absence of sufficient legal infrastructure to handle the problem. This problem has been overcome previously, as laws have been implemented to enable the boarding of ships in relation to other maritime crimes, such as piracy, but this has not yet been effectively implemented in regards to drug smuggling.McLaughlin p. 28. In practice, this has meant that vessels suspected of trafficking these illegal substances cannot be boarded by law enforcement, and thus face no legal consequences. Traffickers have taken advantage of this, and are increasingly capitalising on illicit trade through maritime routes. Of the 400 million containers shipped worldwide in 2009, only 2% of these were inspected. Affected areas Many states are directly affected by the drug trade that occurs in the Indian Ocean region, both economically and socially. These detrimental effects are felt throughout many different countries, in a variety of ways, such as a possible increase in drug use by the populations and heightened levels of corruption. =Afghanistan= Afghanistan makes up almost two thirds of the land under illicit opium poppy cultivation in the world. The opiate trade originating in Afghanistan fuels the corruption throughout the country by funding the Taliban and their activities.McLaughlin p. 31. This has been confirmed through drug seizures made by the CMF, who have concluded that the drugs originated from areas in Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, by using a combination of the drug stamps found on the bags of heroin, and the isotope testing of the poppy gum. The UNODC estimated that in 2009 alone, the Taliban received 140-170 million USD from the opiate trade. This has also had social implications for the population, with an estimated 2 - 2.5 million people using drugs in Afghanistan alone. =Bay of Bengal= India‚Äôs size and position means it has multiple roles in the southern route, both as a destination country and transit point for further destinations.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 67. The UNODC has estimated that 54% of the heroin in India is produced domestically, while 45% originates from Afghanistan. India is particularly vulnerable to the southern route due to its western border with Pakistan.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 68. Near this border, in the western Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, is where many of the heroin seizures occur. In 2012, 105kg of drugs were seized, which had been trafficked from Pakistan along rail routes. In 2013 alone, the Indian Narcotics Control Bureau reported seizures totalling 4,609kg.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 69. Data collected through seizures by various authorities has confirmed India as a transit country for Southeast Asia, West Africa and North America.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 69. Bangladesh also faces significant problems due to drug trade through the Indian Ocean and India.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 71. The country suffers from illicit drug use among its population, such as in Dhaka where there are an estimated 2.5 million people using drugs. India is a large provider of heroin to the Bangladeshi market, and it is trafficked over the western and eastern borders. However, it is unclear whether the heroin originates from Afghanistan or India, as this data has not been sufficiently collected. Both India and Bangladesh are becoming ever more dependent on maritime trade, with these states importing over US$ 52 million and US$ 447 million respectively. Therefore, to function effectively they require an absence of maritime crime in order for trade to be uninterrupted, and for their economies to thrive. Sri Lanka has also faced an increase in heroin use within the country, as well as becoming a transit country for trafficking destined for other places.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 72. Much of the heroin entering Sri Lanka arrives on fishing boats or by air, often coming through India or Pakistan. The numbers of seizures which Sri Lankan authorities have conducted remains relatively small, meaning that the data collected is not always reliable. Smugglers in Sri Lanka have come from a variety of countries, including Pakistan, India, Iran and the Maldives. =East Africa= Heroin from Afghanistan enters East Africa through the Swahili Coast, from the Indian Ocean. Many of the countries in East Africa affected by drug trafficking along the southern route, have high poverty levels, poor governance and security challenges.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 86. This is exacerbated by ongoing tensions and conflicts within the region, making these states especially vulnerable to organised crime and the threat of exploitation that these criminal groups pose. Heroin seizures have indicated an increase in drug flow to the region, and further utilisation of the southern route. This has led to a growth in drug use and a rise in drug injecting in countries such as Mauritius, South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 87. Opiates often reach East African on dhows, which are traditional trading ships originating in Arab and South Asian countries.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 88. Dhows used for smuggling have been caught carrying up to 1,000kg of heroin.Afghan Opiate Trafficking p. 90. These East African countries do have their own consumer markets for drugs, but they are also heavily used as trans-shipment ports for routes which continue onwards e.g. to Europe. Mauritius is just one example of an island state which is used as a stopover by drug smugglers intending to continue their journey onwards, often to the coast of Africa. This has been particularly problematic for Mauritius, as it has had numerous social effects for the population. Facilitators in Mauritius, and other trans-shipment states, are often paid with product which means they sell it to locals. Therefore, consumer markets develop locally, thus increasing demand and drug-dependency. Drug abuse is a significant problem within Mauritius, which is regularly evidenced by the ‚ÄòWorld Drug Report‚Äô.Malcolm & Murray p. 246 In 2008, the report illustrated that 2% of the population of Mauritius were affected by the use of opioids, such as heroin. A significant proportion of these drugs enter the country through the coastline, which has been linked to a lack of surveillance in these places and the surrounding maritime areas.Malcolm & Murray p. 247 Many of the illicit substances enter on private yachts, which are not regularly checked. In 2012, a steward previously involved in drug trafficking, expressed that the conditions of the maritime environment made smuggling simple as the oceans are so vast and avoiding capture is easy. A 1986 report from the CIA expressed concern over the entry of illegal drugs to Mauritius, stating that these were both consumed locally and smuggled onwards to South Africa. Therefore, this has been a long-standing problem, which has become entrenched in Mauritian society. These drugs largely originate from Pakistan, India and South Africa, and are smuggled through the Indian Ocean. Policy responses There have been responses from both individual states and international forces, but neither have yet controlled the illicit drug trade throughout the region. Navies have been a core part of this response, often reacting prior to foreign policy guidance.Bateman p. 16. There have been some notable actions among these coast guards and navies, including some cross-state collaboration. The Indian Navy has established cooperative activities with South East Asia, and has also assisted East African and island states. The Bangladesh Navy has also prioritised maritime security as an essential element to the stability of the country, so that they can benefit from the blue economy for economic development. In order to establish the security necessary for this, they have facilitated joint exercises with the US Navy and Special Force in the Exclusive Economic zone, which both Japan and India have partaken in during the last decade. The Bangladesh Navy has also engaged in specific anti- smuggling operations, which target drug trafficking. Additionally, the Asian coastguard has been given specialised training and technical equipment to tackle the maritime drug trade, both in the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asian waters. There have also been a number of notable regional responses among the states affected by the illicit maritime drug trade, which is evident throughout the policy of these countries. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has established an operative maritime committee working towards regional coordination.Bateman p. 18. The SADC has specifically emphasised the importance of combating non-traditional maritime threats as part of the 2050 Integrated Maritime Strategy. The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), has enabled the states within the Bay of Bengal to create greater maritime security through collaboration between countries. Furthermore, BIMSTEC has launched a Convention on Cooperation in Combating International Terrorism, Organised Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking. This facilitates regional cooperation specific to the illicit drug trade, and provides the region with the foundations to develop their response further. The existing regional and individual responses by states have, in practice, been limited to seizure- based responses. This is due to gaps in the current legal infrastructure, which prevent effective prosecution of smugglers following drug seizures. Huge drug seizures have been made by both the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) and the Combined task force (CTF), such as when the CTF successfully seized 6.2 tonnes of hashish over two days. However, gaps in the current laws prevent further action. One such example is Article 110 of the UNSC Law of the Sea Convention 1982, which does not include a suspicion of drug smuggling as a legitimate reason to board a vessel without gaining permission from the ship‚Äôs flagged country.McLaughlin p. 27. This has decreased the amount of possible seizures, and gaining permission to board vessels is complicated by insufficient regional cooperation within the criminal justice system.McLaughlin p. 29. Even when seizures do occur, the lack of legal coordination means criminals are released without prosecution, and often continue to engage in the drug trade. Global Maritime Crime Programme in the Indian OceanIndian Ocean Forum on Maritime Crime (IOFMC)= The IOFMC enables regional cooperation to form operational responses to maritime crime. This has been implemented as part of the GMCP IO reaction to encourage regional responses. This has enabled the formation of the ‚ÄòProsecutors‚Äô Network‚Äô, which allows prosecutors from the different coastal states to coordinate their legal strategies. Legislative reform is consequently possible, and legislation on maritime crime can be created. From this, organisations such as the Southern Route Partnership can be developed. =Southern Route Partnership (SRP)= The SRP is a regional organisation, established through the UNODC‚Äôs Global Maritime Crime Programme within the Indian Ocean (GMCP IO). The concept of building the SRP was discussed during the UNODC meeting of the Heads of drug enforcement agencies from the Indian Ocean Region, in October 2016. The SRP involves states directly affected by the use of the southern route for smuggling, with anti-narcotics agencies from countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and the Seychelles becoming involved. The organisation aims to combat the smuggling of Afghan opiates through Pakistan, Iran, the Indian Ocean, and further on into East Africa. Partner agencies from a variety of countries and organisations outside of the region, such as the UK‚Äôs National Crime Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Paris Pact Initiative have also been involved in SRP discussions. As of yet, there is little evidence available of how the SRP has been utilised, but it holds potential as a collaborative tool.

It has been converted into apartments. Sele Mill A blue plaque on the building () commemorates an earlier mill on the site, the country's first paper mill. History A watermill on this site is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. At that time Sele was a manor separate from Hertford. It appears to have been a very small settlement: the recorded population was two households. For most of its history, the mill used the power of the River Beane, a chalk stream which joins the River Lea at Hertford. In the late 15th century it was converted into a paper mill by an entrepreneur called John Tate. As far as is known, this was the first paper mill in the country. It appears to have gone out of production around 1500,Richard L.

Mill race The weir at Sele Mill Although water power is no longer used at the site, there is a 20th-century labyrinth weir on the River Beane designed to produce a head of water for the mill race. There is a programme of works to improve the ecological health of the river and it has been proposed to modify the weir which in its current state poses a barrier to fish migration.

He wrote in Italian and Neapolitan more than one hundred plays and poems, and introduced a more modern theater in Naples, by adapting Carlo Goldoni's work and often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the complex and layered Neapolitan society.  Biography  Filippo Cammarano was born in Palermo in 1764. his father was the famous actor Giancola Cammarano who played successfully the role of Pulcinella for more than thirty years in San Carlino theater in Naples . Giancola Cammarano and his second wife Caterina Sapuppo moved to Naples when Filippo was in young age. There, Filippo learned the art of theater with his father, taking over the role of Pulcinella, before dedicating himself to secondary character actor roles, first in the Fenice theater, then in San Carlino. As a playwright, he published more than one hundred plays and poems, varying the genres, from comedy to drama. He first adapted Gennaro D'Avino's Annella tavernara di Porta Capuana, a successful play from 1747, and then some works by Carlo Goldoni. This work of adaptation allowed him to introduce in the Kingdom of Naples a relatively new form of cultivated comedy, where the dynamism of the commedia dell'arte is associated with the comedy of intrigue. In the plays, the author introduced a certain realism in the representation of the behaviors, and of the character often represented the struggle of the poors, opposed to the intrigues of the nobles. Filippo Cammarano's plays often offer stories taken from One Thousand and One Nights or even inspired from contemporary facts, like the brigandage . He married the famous singer Rosalia Vitellaro, with whom he fathered nine children, many of whom devoted themselves to the theater. Finally, he retired from the stage in 1832, and the king Ferdinand II of Bourbon granted him a pension of 30 ducats. He thanked him with a poem: Vierze strambe e bisbetece.

The film is set in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the devastating 2017 Hurricane Maria, and stars Andy Garc√≠a as struggling used car salesman Rafael \\"Rafa\\" Rodriguez and Dafne Keen as Ana, an 11-year-old girl placed in Rafa‚Äôs care as the two embark on a road trip across Puerto Rico. The film also features Jeanne Tripplehorn, Lauren V√©lez and Ram√≥n Franco in supporting roles. The film was released on video on demand by Gravitas Ventures on January 3, 2020. Plot In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico faces severe economic downturn. Jose Maria Vega runs for Governor of Puerto Rico, despite allegations of illegal campaign financing. In San Juan, Rafael \\"Rafa\\" Rodriguez is a struggling car salesman who moved from Florida after becoming estranged from his children. Rafa discovers 11-year-old Ana, who lives across the street from his car yard, hiding after her mother‚Äôs arrest. Initially planning to take Ana to social services, Rafa feels guilty at the prospect of negligent foster parents. Rafa is horrified to discover that all his cars have been repossessed for failing to repay loans. Rafa leaves Ana with her mother's abusive boyfriend and goes to a cockfight. Ana secretly follows him and witnesses him losing $5,000 and being warned by loan shark Diego that he has five days to repay. Ana confronts Rafa, claiming he needs help to raise the money by the deadline. Rafa visits Ana's mother in prison, discovering Ana's father lives on the other side of Puerto Rico. Rafa and Ana set off together, to deliver Ana to her father and to raise money. Rafa and Ana visit Camila, an ex-lover of Rafa who owes him $1,000. Rafa is hesitant to ask Camila for his money given the financial crisis, but Ana is blunt and forces Camila to pay. During the trip, Ana attempts illegal forms of raising money, from not paying for petrol and buying moonshine to resell. Rafa is resistant, fearing Ana will end up like her mother, and tries to instil values in her. Rafa takes Ana to a blowhole, telling her a fable of a man who fell in and nearly drowned, but was saved by God for his honesty and humility when water blew out of the blowhole. Rafa acknowledges that some of Ana‚Äôs methods may be necessary to raise the money. Rafa reminds Ana that she has to live her father once they arrive. Diego calls Rafa, having discovered that he has left San Juan and that all of his cars are gone, but Rafa assures Diego that he will repay the money. Finding Ana's father, Rafa and Ana discover that he claims not be her father and has another family. Rafa is unsure what to do with Ana. Fearing Rafa will take her to a foster home, Ana runs away. After they reunite, Rafa is furious and takes Ana to a church, hoping to find her a home. Ana pretends to be disabled to collect money from churchgoers. Her deception is discovered and the church's pastor Helen forces Ana to perform volunteer work. Realizing the churchgoers' generosity toward Ana could be exploited, Helen makes Ana pretends her disability was healed by blowhole and promises Ana a percentage of the money raised. Rafa is initially supportive. Camila attends the church and recognizes Ana, horrified at the deception. Rafa realizes the immorality of the scheme. However, Ana feels at home at the church and wants to stay, leaving Rafa to return to San Juan. Admitting to Diego that he cannot pay, Rafa escapes from one of Diego's thugs and visits Ana. Ana seems happy at the church; however, she gives Rafa a pamphlet with \\"$5,000\\" written in it, implying that she is still raising the money for him. Rafa is arrested for possession of moonshine. Ana asks Helen for her cut of the money. Helen reveals that Ana's cut has been donated to Vega's campaign, revealing the church is part of the illegal financing. Ana leaves the church and travels to the blowhole, coming to an epiphany. Contacting Diego, Ana proposes a scheme: Diego posts Rafa‚Äôs bail and poses as an IRS agent to force Helen, using a recording Ana made of her admission, to repay the money or face jail time for fraud. Diego‚Äôs money is repaid in full, and Rafa is freed. Returning to San Juan, Rafa reopens his car yard with the excess money. Vega is arrested for illegal campaign finance. Ana‚Äôs mother is freed and dumps her boyfriend. Ana works at the car yard and remains close friends with Rafa, who has been reunited with his children. Cast * Andy Garc√≠a as Rafael \\"Rafa\\" Rodriguez, a struggling used car salesman from Florida who moved to Puerto Rico after becoming estranged from his children.

Production Dafne Keen made her film debut in 2017, playing the supporting role of Laura / X-23 in Logan, a standalone installment of the X-Men franchise. Logan was a critical and commercial success and Keen's performance was well-received, earning her an Empire Award for Best Female Newcomer at the 23rd Empire Awards. Despite not having a talent agent at the time, Keen was quickly signed on to star the title character in Ana, a road trip drama written by Cris Cole, directed by Charles McDougall, and produced by Luillo Ruiz through his production company Pimienta. In May 2017, Keen was officially announced to be starring alongside Puerto Rican actor Luis Guzm√°n. By the time shooting for the film began in July 2017, Guzm√°n had been replaced by Andy Garc√≠a. Keen confirmed on her Twitter page in August 2017 that shooting was underway with Garc√≠a in the lead role. During shooting, distribution company AMP International was expected to handle international distribution of the film, described as a story following \\"a street-smart urchin and a financially destitute car salesman whose friendship blooms after a chance encounter. The pair embark on a road trip to try and save him from bankruptcy... or worse.\\" The film was shot entirely on location in Puerto Rico by a Puerto Rican crew. Of this decision, producer Luillo Ruiz said \\"This is a very dear project for us about an island, a girl, a father figure and this amazing journey of self-discovery. We were very fortunate to get two brilliant actors, Andy [Garc√≠a] and Dafne [Keen], whose chemistry shines on screen. They give incredible depth to this unlikely duo. It was completely filmed in Puerto Rico by Puerto Rican crew and the result is fantastic.\\" Release By December 2019, the film's distribution rights were picked up by online distribution company Gravitas Ventures. By that time, Keen had begun starring in the BBC/HBO television series His Dark Materials, based on the trilogy of fantasy novels of the same name by English novelist Philip Pullman. Keen starred as the series' lead character Lyra Belacqua / Lyra Silvertongue and received praise for her performance. Of the film, Gravitas Ventures vice- president of acquisitions Tony Piantedosi said \\"[Director] Charles [McDougall] has crafted a vibrant road movie, bolstered by the lively rapport between Dafne [Keen] and Andy [Garc√≠a], that the whole family can enjoy.\\" Gravitas Ventures opted to give the film a limited theatrical release, while also releasing it to video on demand services worldwide on January 3, 2020. In the United States, the film was made available for purchase or rental on Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, Vudu, and other similar services. =Reception= Ana received mixed reviews, with praise for Garc√≠a and Keen's performances, the Puerto Rican setting, and the film's avoidance of the \\"trappings of a road trip movie\\". Some reviews were highly positive. Writing for Cinema Babel, Garrett Eberhardt wrote that \\"Ana is a charming, funny, and socially relevant surprise\\", praising the performances as the \\"heartbeat of the film and what gives it its power and purpose.\\" Eberhardt praised the \\"heartfelt\\" relationship between the leads and the cinematography by Sonnel Vel√°zquez (comparing it to Vittorio Storaro's cinematography for the 1979 film Apocalypse Now) which he believed \\"show[ed] off the lush, colorful locales of the Puerto Rican island along with some eye-popping shots and camera work.\\" Eberhardt noted the film's social commentary, featuring a corrupt politician who promises to improve people's lives, and the theme of \\"desperate... people... forced to do what they must to survive.\\" Other reviews were mixed, while still complementing the film's performances and unique approach to the road trip genre. Cinemarter's review of the film described it as \\"formulaic\\", while still praising the Puerto Rican setting as helping it to stand out and the chemistry between the leads as being \\"enough to make it not a bad watch\\", and ultimately calling the film a \\"better-than-average road trip movie.\\" Keith & the Movies' review echoed these thoughts, describing the Puerto Rican setting as \\"compelling... and... a key player throughout the film\\", particularly praising the depiction of Hurricane Maria's economic aftermath. The review noted the film's familiar story and described the church storyline as being a \\"speed bump\\", but ultimately described the film as \\"a surprisingly sweet and heartfelt movie... full of warmth and humor.\\" Similarly, Amari Allah's review for Wherever I Look praised Keen's \\"charisma and presence\\" and compared her rising career to that of Natalie Portman in the 1990s, writing that Keen and Garc√≠a \\"enhance each other‚Äôs presence to the point you can forgive the film‚Äôs shortcomings.\\" Allah also praised how the film \\"address[ed] all aspects of post-Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico\\", while criticizing the writing as being \\"surface-level\\" and the story as \\"overstaying its welcome\\", while still conceding that the film is \\"firmly... worth seeing.\\"  References External links  Category:2020 comedy-drama films Category:2020 independent films Category:Puerto Rico Category:American coming-of-age comedy- drama films Category:American independent films Category:2020 films Category:2020s coming-of-age drama films Category:American films Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films set in Puerto Rico Category:Films shot in Puerto Rico Category:English-language films Category:Spanish-language films ","title":"Ana (2020 film)"},{"id":"64106564","text":"Deportation of Jews from Greece in March 1944 Pulling dead Jews from the Ia»ôi pogrom and Holocaust train in Romania Resettlement to the East () was a Nazi euphemism used to refer to the deportation of Jews and others such as Gypsies to extermination camps and other murder locations as part of the Final Solution. The Nazis used the euphemism as an attempt to fool their victims into thinking that they would be \\"resettled\\" somewhere else, usually a labour camp, but not all victims believed the claim. The Germans also used the word \\"evacuation\\", implying preservation from danger and equally misleading to the victims. The Jews were allowed a small luggage allowance, but the luggage was loaded separately and often was left at the station for disposal later, after the trains left. German Jews and their luggage were collected openly and in full view of the public before their transportation to the local railway station. To keep the lie credible, receipts were given, and the luggage was carried separately and collected from the victims after their murder. Holocaust trains Romanians remove corpses of Jewish victims deported from Ia»ôi after a pogrom. Nazi document detailing deportations to Treblinka extermination camp Most of the victims were carried to their deaths by Reichsbahn trains in locked and windowless cattle wagons, with few sanitary arrangements and little or nothing in the way of water or food. The wagons were supposed to carry just 50 persons but were normally packed with 100 to 150 victims, the overcrowding making sitting impossible and increasing their distress. The Holocaust trains were hired by Adolf Eichmann, and the Reichsbahn demanded one-way fares be paid by the victims although children below the age of four were allowed free travel to their deaths. The trains travelled to local death camps in Poland at Chelmno, Belzec, Treblinka, Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau, but the early trains in 1939 and 1940 also travelled to Nazi ghettos in the east, and the victims were usually murdered there by Einsatzgruppen organized by Reinhard Heydrich. Conditions on the Holocaust trains were so bad that many passengers died en route to the death camps especially as it often took many days to reach their destinations. The cattle cars in which the victims were carried were completely unheated in winter and unventilated in hot weather and so the passengers were exposed to either hypothermia or heat stroke. Deaths among the elderly, children and sick were common. To maintain the deception, some passengers were given postcards by the guards to send to their relatives with dictated words about their successful \\"resettlement\\". That decepion continued even to the death camps, such as with a bogus station at Treblinka and Sobibor camps that was complete with signs, a station clock (with a fixed time showing) and flower tubs to reassure the victims who debouched there. Einsatzgruppen Einsatzgruppen reports even listed Jews who had been executed locally as having been \\"resettled\\": \\"the euphemistic term \\"resettled\\" (ausgesiedelt) was understood to mean something else (erschossen or hingerichtet/shot or executed)\\". During the war, the Polish underground press already warned foreign media not to accept the claim of resettlement at face value. Holocaust deniers claim that the use of the phrase in Nazi documents refers to the actual resettlement of Jews, rather than their murder, but those claims are rejected by historians.

It stands on the main High Street of the village surrounded by a churchyard. It is within the Diocese of Oxford. History The parish church in Ivinghoe was founded in 1220 On 9 May 1234 the church and the village was burned down by the rebel Richard Siward in an attack on the lands of the church's patron, Peter des Roches the Bishop of Winchester. Architecture Nikolaus Pevsner described St. Mary‚Äôs as \\"a big and noble church\\". This Early English church was laid out c.1220 in an original cruciform floorplan with a central tower topped with a lead fl√®che, a typical example of a Hertfordshire spike. The exterior is faced with flint and has Totternhoe stone dressings, and the walls are topped with decorative crenellations which were added in the 19th century. It is thought that the an older church may have originally stood here in the 12th century. The thickness of the west wall suggests that this older church may have been enlarged to form the present building. The church was rebuilt after 1234, but some original features survive, including rose windows in the transepts. The chancel, transepts, and nave arcades are all early 13th century. In the 14th century the tower was rebuilt and the aisles were widened. The 15th century saw considerable expansion of the church: the walls of the nave, chancel and transepts were raised, a clerestory was added above the nave, windows were inserted, the upper part of the tower was rebuilt and the west porch was added. There has been a peal of bells in the tower since at least 1552, when records list 5 bells and a Sanctus bell. The present bells were recast by John Warner & Sons of London in 1875. Within the church, the aisles are lit by Decorated Period windows. Much medieval stonework is in evidence with moulded doorways and ballflower ornaments and carved foliated bosses. The church is especially noted for its fine 15th-century tie-beam roof, supported by stone corbels with sculpted heads and carved wooden angels with outspread wings. In the nave roof, the braces feature carved figures of the apostles. Set into the north wall of the chancel is a decorated recessed tomb topped with a recumbent effigy of a priest wearing vestments for celebrating Mass. The head and feet have been defaced and the identity of the effigy is unknown. It has been variously surmised to be the tomb of Peter Chaceporc, rector of the church 1241-1254; Ralph de Ivinghoe (d.1304); Henry de Blois, Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen; or someone named \\"Gramfer\\". The chancel contains several medieval monumental brasses including one dedicated to Rauf Fallywolle (or Fallowell, d.1349) and his wife Lucie (d.1368), and another dedicated to Richard Blackhed (d.1517) and his wife Maude. Several of the memorials depict members of the large Duncombe family, showing the deceased accompanied by smaller groups of their children, including the memorials of Thomas Doncombe (d.1531), and his wife Joan; the memorial to William Duncombe (d.1576) and his two wives Mary and Alice; and John Douncombe (d.1594) and Alyce his wife. In the nave are oak pews dating from the 15th or 16th century, noted for their carved poppyhead finials with grotesque faces. There is a hexagonal, ornately carved Jacobean oak pulpit. In 1871/2, the church underwent a restoration by the architect George Edmund Street, who introduced some Victorian Gothic Revival elements and built the north and south porches, as well as a medieval-style baptistery. =Architectural features= An unknown priest - geograph.org.uk - 788084.jpgThe tomb of the unknown priest Bench End - geograph.org.uk - 788059.jpgThe carved poppyhead pew finials with grotesque faces St.Mary's church roof - geograph.org.uk - 788055.jpgCarved wooden angels decorate the 15th-century tie-beam roof Churchyard Many of the headstones in the churchyard are 17th century and mostly indecipherable.

He played nine first-class matches for South Australia between 1923 and 1925. He played district cricket from 1922 to 1937 representing Sturt, Colts, and University. Personal life Walsh's father was Frederick Walsh, a well-known tailor in Adelaide. He had a twin brother, L. S. Walsh, who also played First-Class cricket for South Australia. In 1930 he married Gwendoline Spinkston with his brother acting as best man at the wedding, and they had a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1936. In his career Walsh worked for the Vacuum Oil Company, Proprietary Limited. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in Adelaide in 1940, was serving as a Lieutenant by 1944, and was discharged in January 1945.Norman Arthur Walsh at AustraliaRemembers Cricket careerEarly promise= P.A.C. Intercollegiate champion side. Walsh is at front on left. Walsh began his cricket career after enrolling at Prince Alfred College in 1912, playing for the College side and becoming well-known, being part of the side which won the 1918 Intercollegiate Cricket competition. He captained the College team for the 1919-20 and 1920-21 seasons. He was a pace bowler for the college side, and took 5 for 13 and 5 for 14 in a B grade district game for the College against Port Adelaide, but also became known for his batting when he scored a 106 for the College in a B Grade district game against West Torrens in November 1921. He also played for the Prince Alfred tennis team, as did his twin brother who was also a cricketer. In the last game of the 1921-22 district season Walsh played for University, and in April 1922 he was selected for a team representing the South Australian A Grade Association in a match against a team representing Broken Hill in which he scored eight batting at number three and took 5 for 13 with the ball. In the 1922-23 season he began playing for Sturt and in November 1922 he was described as showing promise as a batsman albeit with a cramped style. In January a report on the 1922-23 season so far noted Walsh's aggressive approach had been appealing to spectators. Overall in the 1922-23 season he had a batting average of 26 and received the Sturt club Trophy for most promising junior. He was selected in some developmental squads throughout the 1922-23 season in addition to playing for Sturt. In December 1922 he was selected for a South Australian junior side which played a Victorian junior side at the Adelaide Oval. In the fourth innings of the game, which South Australia lost by one run, Walsh scored just 32, but batted aggressively with a report noting that his innings was spectacular to watch. In late January he was invited to a net session by the South Australian Cricket Association which was to be used to determine selection of the state side, and in February he was selected to practice for the George Giffen Testimonial Match. In April 1923 he was again selected for a combined South Australian Cricket Association side which toured the South-East of the state. At the start of the 1923-24 season a 'Colts' side for junior players was introduced to the district competition by the South Australian Cricket Association which was for players under 23 who had potential to become First-Class cricketers. Walsh was selected for the new Colts team rather than Sturt, although any juniors not selected for Colts in a round could also be selected for their club side. He scored 88 for the Colts against Sturt in the first game of the season, and 76 against Adelaide in the second with the first 50 runs being scored in 82 minutes. In November 1923 he was noted as being in consideration for selection in the South Australian side, described as the most promising junior South Australia had seen for some time, and selected for match practice ahead of the first Sheffield Shield game of the season. =State career= On December 14, 1923, Walsh made his First-Class debut for South Australia against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval and scored 2 and 3 on what was a wet wicket which required mopping before play and took one run out.South Australia v New South Wales, 14-18 December 1923 at Cricinfo Later in December he represented South Australia again in a non-Shield First-Class game against Queensland in Adelaide, with the selectors receiving praise for persisting with him, and scored 4 in South Australia's only innings and took a catch.South Australia v Queensland, 26-28 December 1923 at Cricinfo He was twelfth-man for South Australia's games against Victoria at the M.C.G.Victoria v South Australia 2-5 January 1924 at Cricinfo and NSW in Sydney at the start of January.New South Wales v South Australia 11-14 January 1924 at Cricinfo He returned to the playing XI against Victoria in Adelaide in February 1924 and improved his statistics with a 17 and 33 and another runout.South Australia v Victoria, 15-20 February 1924 at Cricinfo After the First-Class season Walsh returned to playing for the Colts and represented them in the district semi- final, losing to Port Adelaide. In the off-season Walsh played for the Colts on another tour of the South-East, and in April 1924 he played in a novelty game between junior cricketers and retired veterans, including Ernie Jones, George Giffen, and Clem Hill, playing on the veterans team. In the 1924-25 season he returned to Sturt, as players who had played two or more First-Class games were not allowed to play for the Colts, although early in the season he secured a permit to play for University instead as he played football for the University side. Despite his poor beginning in First-Class cricket he was still in contention for selection for South Australia and played in some intra-state practice matches in October 1924. He had a solid early season for University, averaging 120 after the first two games, and his selection in a fourteen man squad from which South Australia's side for the first Sheffield Shield game of the season against Victoria was picked was uncontroversial. Walsh played against Victoria in the 1924-25 Sheffield Shield opening game at the Adelaide Oval and batted aggressively, but was only able to score 27 of South Australia's 518 runs in the first innings and a 33 in the second. In November he was selected to represent Australia in a tour game against the M.C.C. Ashes side, and scored 34 not out in the first innings, accompanying Arthur Richardson to his double-century, but only scored 2 opening in the second innings. He played his first First-Class game not at the Adelaide Oval against Victoria on the M.C.G. in late November, but was unable to score, making just 2 and 14.Victoria v South Australia 21-27 Nov 1924 at Cricinfo In late December/early January he played against New South Wales at the S.C.G. and made a duck and 11, and bowled for the first time in First-Class cricket taking 1 for 25.New South Wales v South Australia 28 Nov-2 Dec 1924-25 at Cricinfo He was dropped to twelfth man for South Australia's final game of the season against NSW at home, but after Arthur Richardson was injured he withdrew at the last minute as he was unable to secure leave from work and was replaced by another twelfth man. Walsh had a strong return to district cricket after another disappointing First-Class season scoring 110 for University against East Torrens in February 1925. He played in the district final which University won, but they lost the challenge match against his old club Sturt for the 1924-25 Premiership although Walsh did top score for University with 57. The South Australian Cricket Association persisted with Walsh into the 1925-26 season, selecting him in a trial intra-state match in October 1925, and he scored 23. A report of his early performance in the district season noted that he was reportedly batting well in practice, but struggling to convert that form into runs in matches. It was also reported that he had largely stopped bowling. He was not first choice for the state team for the season opener against Victoria, but was selected after two players withdrew from the XI, and made a duck in the first innings, but moved up to open in the second and scored 24,South Australia v Victoria, 13-18 1925 at Cricinfo in what was observed to be an uncharacteristically reserved fashion. He was retained in the side for a non-Sheffield Shield game against Western Australia a few days later opening the batting and scored 21 in the first innings and 15 chasing a total of 32 in the second innings in what was his last First-Class game.South Australia v Western Australia 21-12 November 1925 As of March 1926 Walsh had scored 417 runs at an average of 41.70 in the district cricket season, and his season was described as consistent but not outstanding. He represented South Australia in cricket again in April 1926 in a Y.M.C.A. cricket tournament scoring 109 in 50 minutes. In late April he played in the game in which University won the 1925-26 Premiership against his old club Sturt. =Post First-Class career= Norman Walsh, 1936. Walsh returned to Sturt Cricket Club for the 1926-27 season. In October 1926 he was once again selected in an intra-state trial match ahead of the district and Sheffield Shield seasons, but was mediocre, and pulled out of a second trial match later the same month. In November he was reportedly in contention to be selected for a South Australian tour of New Zealand. In December he was selected in a team of Prince Alfred College alumni which played a game against the current College cricket team, and in January 1927 he played in a Prince Alfred College alumni vs St. Peter's College alumni match in which he scored a century which was hailed as a return to form, as he had been poor in the district season. In March he scored 70 in 107 minutes for Sturt in a district semi-final which was described as consisting of pretty batting and featured a large six, but scored a duck in the final against Port Adelaide which Sturt lost. In the off-season Walsh injured himself playing football for a Prince Alfred College alumni side which he was captaining and missed the first game of the 1927-28 district season. The injury persisted until late October, and after recovering he played for Sturt in the B Grade side, scoring 39 and 71, to prepare for A Grade cricket again. He scored just 9 in his first innings in A Grade cricket for the season. He scored 116 against Adelaide in the fourth round, and 125 against Glenelg in the fifth round. In January 1928 he participated in a net session for promising South Australian juniors coached by Patsy Hendren at the Adelaide Oval. At the end of the 1927-28 rounds in March he had scored 377 runs at an average of 62.83 in the season. He scored 16 and 63 in a semi-final against East Torrens which Sturt lost, and after the finals he had reached 502 runs for the season, the most of any batsman for Sturt.Sturt District Cricket Club - Awards He played football again in the off-season and vice-captained South Australia in an amateur game against a Victorian side in May 1928. In August he was awarded a Trophy for best A Grade batting in the previous season at a Sturt Cricket Club event. In October 1928, during the 1928-29 district season, Walsh was invited to a net session for players with potential to be selected in a tour game against the M.C.C. Ashes side, however by the end of the rounds he had scored just 153 runs for Sturt at an average of 19.12 in the season, and he was playing for the Sturt B Grade team in March. In the offseason he took up baseball for a Sturt baseball team, and achieved the best season batting average. He improved in the 1929-30 district season, and was once again mentioned as a potential selection for the state side in December 1929, and overall he scored 351 runs at 31.90 in the season with a top score of 95 and took 8 wickets at 43.62. In his first three matches of the 1930-31 season he scored 100 runs at an average of 33.33. He scored well consistently in the 1931-32 season, and was in contention for highest aggregate of the season with 573 runs shortly before the end of the season, and finished third with 582 runs at 52.90. Sturt also won the Premiership, and Walsh had scored the most runs for the club in the season.Sturt District Cricket Club - Awards In September 1933 Walsh was appointed assistant secretary for the Sturt Cricket Club and also to a temporary selection committee, having previously judged an open trial for bowlers under 25 to join Sturt in January 1930. He scored 320 runs at 32.00 without a century in the 1933-34 district season. He had a poor season in 1934-35 scoring just 152 runs at 16.80 and failing to reach fifty, but improved in the 1935-36 season and was able to score 359 runs in the season and 106 in a semi-final. He played in the 1936-37 season but was not among the leading run scorers. Walsh retired from district cricket before the 1937-38 season and began playing for the Prince Alfred Old Collegians side in Adelaide Turf cricket, scoring 102 in November 1938. As of 1941 Walsh was still associated with the Sturt Cricket Club but had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. In 1944 he played in an Australian services cricket match in Queensland taking 7 for 27 with the ball. In 1946 he served on a committee which organized a Sturt Cricket Club reunion which also welcomed returned servicemen who had played for the club, representing the period 1920 to 1930.

Early life Foster was born in the parish of Westbury-on-Trym, now a suburb of Bristol, but then in Gloucestershire, on 30 May 1830. He was baptised at the parish church of St Augustine the Less, which stood next to Bristol Cathedral on College Green, on 25 June 1830. He was the son of Thomas Foster and his wife, Sarah Fowler. The Fosters were a well-known family of local architects and surveyors and John joined his father's firm in the 1840s Foster & Wood architects Joseph Wood (1822-1905) had worked with Foster's father, Thomas, who died in 1849, and from 1849 the firm was known as Foster & Wood. In 1854 Joseph Wood married John Foster's sister, Catherine, and of their two sons, Thomas Foster Wood and Joseph Foster Wood, Joseph is known to have been associated with the practice. Foster & Wood have been described as the \\"most active and ..most consistent architectural firm in Bristol\\" and it has been suggested that John Foster specialised in the Italianate style favoured in the mid nineteenth century, while Joseph Wood's work inclined to the Gothic. Their work ranged from church building and restoration to the design of schools, workhouses, private dwellings and commercial property. Bristol buildings The following buildings were designed by the practice during John Foster's lifetime. *1853: The Athenaeum, Corn Street *1855: Victoria Square, Clifton, South West Range *1857: Muller's Orphanage, Ashley Down (second stage work begun 1855) *1859: Royal Promenade, Queen's Road *1861: Foster's Almshouse, Colston Street *1861: Archway to Boyce's Avenue, Victoria Square *1862: Temple Colston School, Victoria Street *1864: Grand Hotel, Broad Street *1864: Colston Hall, Colston Street *1867: Bristol Museum and Library, Queen's Road *1875: Bristol Grammar School, University Road *1878: Bengough's Almshouse, Horfield Road Ecclesiastical architecture Foster & Wood were responsible for ecclesiastical restorations throughout the West Country, as well as further afield. *1854: Arley Chapel, Arley Hill (total cost about ¬£3900) *1855/6: Congregational Church, Hill Street, Clevedon, Somerset *1856: Moravian Church, Kingswood, Gloucestershire *1856/7: Holy Trinity, Burrington, Somerset restoration *1862: St John the Evangelist's Church, Kenn, Somerset restoration *1864/5: St Lawrence's church, Wick St Lawrence, Somerset restoration *1869: St David's Church Prendergast, Pembrokeshire rebuilding *1871: St George's Brandon Hill, fittings *1871/2: St Michael and All Angels, Dinder, Somerset restoration Methodist connection Joseph Wood was the son of a Wesleyan minister, also called Joseph Wood, and it has been said that the firm had a near monopoly of Methodist building in the city. *1857: Wesleyan Day School, Backfields *1858: Wesleyan Chapel, Midsomer Norton, Somereset *1860: Victoria Wesleyan Church, Queen's Road *1860: Hanham Wesleyan Schools *1864: Wesleyan Church, Portland Street, Kingsdown *1879: Methodist chapel, Front Street, Churchill, Somerset Buildings outside Bristol *1850: Frankfort Hall, Clevedon, Somerset *1857: Wrington School, Somerset *1859/60 Market Hall, Midsomer Norton, Somerset *1859: Ilfracombe Schools, Devon Later life Foster continued to live with his family, first in Park Street and then at South Parade, Clifton, until his marriage on 9 April 1874 at St John's Church, Taunton to Catherine Walkey Gillett, daughter of George Gillett. Foster & Wood appeared regularly in the local newspapers as architects and surveyors to the Bristol Charities Trust, but there is a pause in their activity between 1873 and 1876, which is probably related to Foster's health; his obituary says he died after a long illness. Directories gave his residence as Weston Villa, Carlton Place between 1875 and 1878. He died on 4 June 1880 at Chelsea.

The storm and its precursor disturbance caused moderate flooding and flash flooding to Florida and South Carolina. The second named storm of the very active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Bertha formed from a trough near the east coast of Florida on May 25. The storm was not considered likely to develop at the time, but in favor of warm sea surface temperatures over the Gulf Stream, quickly became a closed low and was designated a tropical storm 3 hours before its landfall in South Carolina. The storm would then move further inland to the Northeastern United States, providing heavy rainfall and tropical storm force winds across the region as a post-tropical storm, as well as severe thunderstorms and even a tornado. Meteorological history On May 25, the NHC began to track thunderstorms associated with an elongated surface trough located over Florida and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean for potential development into a tropical cyclone, but did not expect formation due to strong upper-level winds and the high potential for the disturbance to move inland. However, contrary to predictions, the system organized after moving northwards, which in turn was contributed to an increase in convection and winds within the system. Based on NWS Doppler radar data from Charleston and buoy data, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Bertha at 12:00 UTC on May 27. Bertha continued to rapidly strengthen despite its proximity to land. One hour after the first advisory was issued, Bertha made landfall on the South Carolina coast with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). From formation until landfall, Bertha had an unusually small field of gale-force winds, stretching only 25 miles from the center. Bertha began to weaken rapidly once inland, becoming a tropical depression just hours after landfall. Bertha quickly degenerated to a post-tropical remnant over West Virginia at 09:00 UTC on May 28. The remnants of this storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and enlarged in size. The cyclone, associated with a cold front brought heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and flooding to the Great Lakes region before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system a day later over southern Quebec. Preparations The NHC warned that regardless of development, the precursor disturbance could cause flash flooding, dangerous marine conditions, and life- threatening surf and rip currents. Since the development of Bertha was very unexpected, tropical storm warnings were issued for parts of for the coast of South Carolina from Edisto Beach to South Santee River only an hour before landfall. The National Hurricane Center warned that given very saturated antecedent conditions, rainfall from Bertha can produce life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding. Impact Post-Tropical Cyclone Bertha weakening after making landfall. =Florida= The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Bertha caused a significant, multi-day rainfall event across South Florida, with accumulations of across several locations, and with a maximum 72-hour accumulation of in Miami. Rainfall rates of an hour contributed to a 24-hour total of there, more than doubling the previous daily rainfall record and resulting in the city's most significant rain event in eight years. In and around Miami, the rains contributed to the inundation of homes and roadways, especially in close proximity to canals. Some homes even reported partial roof collapses throughout Hallandale Beach and Hollywood as a result of the heavy precipitation. Local police in El Portal asked that the South Florida Water Management District open floodgates to relieve flooding in those canals. In Hialeah, several vehicles were stranded in flooded roadways, prompting several water rescues. The mayor asked residents to remain indoors accordingly. Days of heavy rainfall prompted local National Weather Service offices to issue flash flood warnings, and sporadic severe thunderstorms prompted additional advisories. An EF1 tornado caused primarily tree and fencing damage in southern Miami, though several campers were also overturned. Gusts associated with the disturbance in Florida topped out at near Key Biscayne, Florida. Even as the system progressed north away from Florida, the outer fringes of Tropical Storm Bertha contributed to stormy weather across the state on May 27, therefore forcing the cancellation of the planned Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch. Damage across the state reached $71,000. =Carolinas= Bertha brought moderate flooding to Charleston, South Carolina after it made landfall. Minor power outages occurred throughout the state. A drowning was reported in Myrtle Beach due to rip currents from Bertha after the storm made landfall. The remnants of Bertha caused $62,000 in damage across North Carolina.

Life  Born in Dresden, Schubert was born in 1925 as the son of the Dresden professor of architecture and architect Otto Schubert and the teacher Veronika n√©e Str√ºver, whose parents were well established in the high society of Dresden; this was especially true of his grandfather, who was a model for him as a lawyer. His paternal grandfather is the sculptor Hermann Schubert. Schubert attended the , which he completed in February 1944 with the Abitur. He escaped being drafted into the Wehrmacht because of an illness that took him two years. In 1946, however, he began studying history and economics at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen. In 1952 he was awarded a doctorate with a study on Ludwig Camerarius by Franz Schnabel. This work, with Ludwig Camerarius, who was born in Nuremberg but worked in Palatinate and Swedish services, represented a picture of his life that still showed intellectual horizons even during the Thirty Years' War. Schubert, who had been working for the Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences since 1952, began a major study of the older German Reichstag in the image of journalism between 1495 and 1648 after the printing of his dissertation. With this work, which like the dissertation opened up completely new and extraordinarily broad horizons, he habilitated at the University of Munich in 1959. In the following years, he revised and supplemented it considerably until it was published in 1966. In 1962 Schubert became a dietary lecturer in Munich, where he also provided the chair of his great patron Franz Schnabel. Only one year later, this time inspired by Carl Dietrich Erdmann, he was appointed Professor of Medieval and Modern History at the Christian-Albrechts- Universit√§t zu Kiel. After refusing a call to the University of Hamburg, he took over the chair of Medieval and Modern History at the University of Frankfurt am Main held by Otto Vossler in 1968. From 1952 to 1963 he was also editor of Neue Deutsche Biographie. Among his academic students were among others Sigrid Jahns, Johannes Kunisch and Volker Press. Gerhard Menk began his doctorate with Schubert. Schubert belonged to the rediscoverers of the older German Reichstag as a weighty institution in the European environment and, incidentally, also of the work of the Calvinist state theorist Johannes Althusius. Like Franz Schnabel, Schubert was a representative of the German new humanism, which had a strong impact in Munich in the immediate post-war period. Schubert not only had a Western and liberal understanding of history, but also made a significant contribution to placing the older German constitutional institutions at the centre of the common European intellectual tradition throughout the early modern period. A major work on European monarchy history has unfortunately been lost. Schubert was a member of the . During the West German student movement he was exposed to the protests of leftist students, who mistakenly identified him as an exponent of a highly conservative educational ideal and professorship. He successfully defended himself against them in court, but was unable to convince them of his fundamental liberal views. In the summer of 1973, Schubert chose committed suicide at the age of 47 in Kiel as the dean of the department at the time.

A professional version with different control layout and audio path electronics was manufactured concurrently as the Studer A721. A later improved version was marketed as the Revox B215S. Because it was expensive compared to other consumer models, and had exceptionally good mechanical performance and durability, the B215 was used primarily by professional customers‚Äîradio stations, recording studios and real-time cassette duplicators. The B125 used a proven, reliable four-motor tape transport derived from the earlier B710 model. The B215 differed from the B710 and competing decks of the period in having an unusual, computer-like control panel and elaborate automation performed by three Philips microcontrollers. The deck was equipped with automatic tape calibration, microcontroller- assisted setting of recording levels, and non-volatile memory. Objective, independently measured and verified specifications of the Revox matched or surpassed those of the best competing decks; comparative tests placed the B215 on the same level as the Nakamichi Dragon and above the flagship models by ASC, Harman Kardon, Tandberg or TEAC. Reviewers praised the Revox for its exemplary mechanical quality and the expected durability of its tape transport and criticized it for lower-than-expected dynamic range and shortcomings in usability.  Development and production  Studer AG, a privately owned Swiss manufacturer of professional audio equipment, began development of high fidelity cassette recorders in late 1970s. Willi Studer was reluctant to diversify into the highly competitive cassette deck market; for most of the decade, the company's experience in cassette technology was limited to reliable but low-fidelity classroom equipment. Author is the owner/operator of recording and tape duplication studios, member of The Legends. However, the decline of reel-to-reel recorder sales, the commercial success of Nakamichi and \\"designer models\\" by Bang & Olufsen, coupled with pressure from within the company, persuaded Studer to invest in the cassette format. Marino Ludwig, designer of the Revox B77 reel-to-reel recorder, examined the best cassette decks on the market and advised Studer on a course of action. Studer agreed with the proposal and appointed Ludwig chief of the cassette project, on the condition that the reputation of Studer and Revox brands would not be compromised in any way. Studer A721 in Kol Yisrael studio In September 1980, Studer AG presented its first cassette deck, the Revox B710; in 1981 it was supplanted by the nearly identical Revox B710 MKII, which added Dolby C noise reduction. In 1982, the company introduced a professional version, the Studer A710, equipped with balanced inputs and outputs. In the United States, the B710 MKII was priced at $1995, more than the rival Nakamichi ZX7 ($1250) but below the flagship Nakamichi 1000ZXL ($3800 for the base version, or $6000 for the \\"limited\\" edition.) The three-head B710 was designed and built to the standards of professional reel-to-reel decks; even its faceplate and controls were borrowed from the B77 recorder. The B710 stood apart from the competition in having a true, four-motor direct-drive tape transport: each of the two capstans and the two reels were driven by their own electric motor without any intermediate belts, gears or idlers. There were no brake pads, belts, pulleys or cogwheels in the whole transport; even the tape counter was driven by an optoelectronic encoder on the reel motors. Mechanically separate recording and replay heads were each adjustable, however there was no user-accessible azimuth control. The B710 was mechanically sound but lacked functionality; most importantly, the deck lacked user-accessible tape calibration controls. Overall, the design was highly conservative. Marino Ludwig wrote that the development coincided with a flood of new features () introduced by the Japanese, and only a few, like automatic tape type recognition, could be implemented within the deadline. Untested novelties that could compromise the product, like dynamic biasing, were rejected from the start. In 1984 Ludwig and Meinrad Liebert designed a successor to B710, the B215. The first pre- production batch was assembled at the end of 1984; the first production decks were shipped to dealers in the beginning of 1985. A professional derivative, the Studer A721, was very similar to the B215 but was equipped with balanced inputs and outputs, and traditional rotary volume controls in place of up-down buttons. The press placed the B215 on a par with the best competing decks, rating its sound quality as high, or almost as high as that of the new reference deck‚Äîthe Nakamichi Dragon. In the United States, the B215 was initially priced at \\"only\\" $1390, lower than either the B710, or the Dragon. \\"Affordable\\" pricing and rugged transport made the B215 the deck of choice for real-time cassette duplicators; for example, by April 1986 Vermont-based Revolution Audio operated a fleet of 200 B215s, 24 hours a day, five days a week, and planned to purchase another 200. German Audio magazine used a stack of ten B215's to duplicate its own test cassettes. Ludwig wrote that the price decrease reflected cost savings achieved through the use of larger printed circuit boards and automated assembly. The introduction of the B215 also coincided with a record low Swiss franc exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, which hit an all-time low in February and March 1985. Subsequently, the Swiss currency exchange rate increased consistently, and so did Revox prices in North America. In 1989, the B215 was priced at $2400, and in 1991, $2600. The improved, cosmetically redesigned B215S, introduced in 1989, was priced at $2800‚Äì$2900‚Äîmore than the Dragon, and three to four times more than contemporary flagship decks by Onkyo, Pioneer or Sony. By this time Willy Studer had retired; in 1990 he sold the company and in 1994 it became a subsidiary of Harman International. New Revox-branded cassette decks sold under Harman management, the consumer H11 and the professional C115,, were in fact rebadged Philips FC-60 / Marantz SD-60 models, and had nothing in common with the Revoxes of the past. Classic flagship decks of the 1980s like the B215, the Dragon or the Tandberg 3014 were discontinued without replacement. Further improvements in cassette sound, if possible at all, required substantial investment in research, but corporate resources were already committed to digital.  Design and operation  Appearance and ergonomics = Rear view of tape transport. Two bronze flywheels in the bottom are capstan motor rotors. Above them is the solenoid that lifts the head subchassis (center) and its hydraulic damper (left, black) The B215, like all B-series Revoxes, is larger than the typical hi-fi component of the period. The enclosure measures and is a standard Studer pressed steel box with two internal stiffener rails that carry the tape transport. The front panel design follows the B200-series styling introduced in 1984 with the release of the B225 CD player. Tape transport and recording mode controls, placed on the upper aluminum strip, are visually set aside from secondary buttons. Loading the cassette into an open transport is performed in two moves: the upper edge of a cassette is inserted first, then the bottom of the cassette is pressed until it locks in place. This presents no problem in everyday use. Open tape transport is less prone to azimuth skew than typical closed-lid transports and simplifies routine cleaning and demagnetization. Recording levels, recording balance and headphone volume are set electronically, with pairs of up/down buttons. There are no microphone inputs; designers deemed those unnecessary for a consumer product. The panel marking, according to Audio (USA) magazine reviewers, is exemplary: black letters on brushed aluminum and white letters on dark-grey plastic are large enough and easily readable at any angle of view. The main backlit liquid-crystal display, on the contrary, is too small, too dim and too hard to read. Another usability failure is the absence of front-panel control lights, even the critical 'Record On' red light is missing (it was later added to the Studer A721, but not the B215). These quirks make it difficult to use the Revox in a darkened room. Reviewers also noted the overall inconvenience of using digital control buttons instead of rotary potentiometers (the latter, again, returned on the Studer A721 but not the Revox decks). = Tape transport = Typical double-capstan tape transport of the 1980s employed direct drive only for the leading (pulling) capstan. The trailing (braking) capstan was belt-driven at a slightly slower speed to provide tape tensioning inside the closed loop. This ensured tight contact between all three heads and the tape (the cassette's pressure pad can only accommodate one head), and mechanically decoupled the tape from the cassette's shell. A Revox deck works differently, directly driving _each_ capstan with its own motor, equipped with a massive flywheel and a 150-pole speed sensor. The speed of each motor is governed by a phase-locked loop, both loops are synchronized with a common crystal oscillator. According to Studer, each capstan was machined to a precision of 1 Œºm (0.001 mm or 0.000039 inch), to ensure very low wow and flutter. In 1985, the only other deck with a similar direct-drive arrangement was the five-motor Nakamichi Dragon (the nearest contender, the four-motor Tandberg 3014, used a single capstan motor). Two other motors of the B215, buried deep inside the mechanism, directly drive the cassette's reels. Motors, capstans and reel spindles are mounted on two diecast chassis plates, tightly bolted together; heads and pinch rollers are mounted on a moving diecast subchassis. All four motors are braked electromagnetically; there are no mechanical brake pads or friction wheels. Autostop is triggered with an optoisolator which senses the presence of transparent leader tape. Winding a 90-minute tape takes no more than 75 seconds, at constant linear tape speed. If, for any reason, the microcontroller detects abnormally high tape tension, it instantly reduces winding speed. At the end of the reel, tape speed is smoothly decreased to avoid end-of-tape impact. According to Howard Roberson of Audio magazine (USA), operation of a new B215 transport \\"...was very quiet, even in play mode - perhaps the quietest of any deck ... tested to date... very well constructed, with a definite look of long-term reliability\\". The B215 uses sendust-and-ferrite heads made by Canon (the B710 used Sony heads, the Revox reel-to-reel heads were manufactured by Studer in-house). Replay head has narrow magnetic gap, recording head has wide gap, but the exact widths of gaps were not disclosed. Unlike the B710, the B215's recording and replay heads, and an isolation wedge between them, are tightly sandwiched together and may not be adjusted individually. Reviewers of Audio and Modern Electronics noted exemplary low phase difference between left and right channels (interchannel time error, ICTE), which was a sign of very good alignment of recording and replay gaps and vanishingly low relative azimuth error. = Audio path = Audio path takes up three PCBs, each spanning the whole depth of the enclosure. Top to bottom: recording board, playback and control motherboard, Dolby board The B215 signal path was designed, from the ground up, for operation with Dolby C noise reduction. The owner's manual advised that \\"selecting noise reduction for new records is simple: use [only] Dolby C\\". The deck uses four Hitachi HA12058 Dolby B/C ICs in \\"double Dolby\\" configuration with independent encoding and decoding channels. Tape type is detected automatically, but the user can override and select the tape type manually. This includes an option of recording Type II (but not Type IV) tapes with 120 Œºs equalization, which may be preferable for recording signals with strong treble content, at the cost of increased noise. The B215 replay head amplifier used discrete JFET input and bipolar second stage; it drives the equalization stage‚Äîan active filter built around an operational amplifier in inverting configuration. Subtle phase control networks in the active filter were tuned to best possible step response; Ludwig wrote that they enabled \\"square-wave reproduction off the tape of truly professional quality\\". The signal then passes through a CMOS switch into the Dolby decoder, and then through another CMOS switch to output buffer stage. A third set of CMOS switches engages to select 70 Œºs time constant instead of default 120 Œºs; as a result, during replay the signal passes through two or three CMOS switches, plus the switches inside the Dolby decoder. The switches inevitably inject their own distortion products into the signal; their performance may be improved by replacement of stock 14000-series switches for newer pin-compatible low-impedance ICs. Line output level is fixed and is unusually \\"hot\\" for consumer audio: 775 mV RMS for nominal magnetization level of 250 nWb/m. Headphone output has eight selectable volume settings, which is sufficient for practical use. Recording audio path, which occupies its own printed board, is far more complex. There are three electronic level controls, wired in series. Continuously variable fade-in and fade-out is performed by an analogue transconductance amplifier. Signal levels at the input of Dolby encoder (\\"recording level\\") and at its output (\\"tape sensitivity\\") are controlled by 8-bit multiplying DACs. Finally, a CMOS multiplexer, coupled to a low-Q bandpass filter centered on 4 kHz, selects the desired mid-range equalization setting. Yet another set of 8-bit multiplying DACs, coupled to a non-defeatable Dolby HX Pro circuit, sets the desired bias current. Dolby dynamic biasing, according to Stereo Review, improves treble saturation levels by about 6 dB. = Microcontrollers and embedded software = Three Philips MAB8440 microcontrollers and EEPROM (right, with paper tag) The deck's control functions are spread between three identical Philips MAB8440 microcontrollers, clocked with a common crystal. Each microcontroller carries of program memory and 128Bytes of random-access memory. The first microcontroller polls faceplate keyboard, infrared remote control port, and an optically decoupled RS-232 port; the second one controls the motors and calculates real-time tape counter values. The third microcontroller manages digital-to-analog converters, CMOS switches, multiplexers and recording level meter; it executes the tape calibration program and stores current settings in non-volatile memory. The EEPROM is updated at every transition to standby mode, or when the user presses a dedicated _Store_ button. Microcontrollers, display and DAC drivers are connected with an I¬≤C serial bus which was introduced by Philips in the early 1980s; according to Ludwig, a standardized bus was a prerequisite for a project of such size. The B215 is equipped with a unique real-time tape counter. After the user loads a cassette (rewound or not) and presses the \\"play\\" button, embedded software estimates current tape position by comparing angular speeds of cassette reels. Initial estimation takes 5‚Äì8 seconds. The deck also estimates the complete playing time of a cassette, albeit with uncertainty; to decrease the margin of error, the user can set playing time manually to 46, 60, 90 or 120 minutes. With this prompt, according to Audio magazine reviewers, absolute error does not exceed one minute for a C90 cassette. The B125's transport control software has a peculiar quirk that precludes complete rewinding of tape. After the deck completes rewinding, or after the user inserts an already rewound cassette, the B215 checks for the presence of opaque magnetic tape in the tape channel. If the optoelectronic sensor detects transparent leader tape, the deck slowly winds the tape forward until the sensor encounters opaque tape; this feature cannot be manually overridden. The deck is now ready for replay or recording, but performing auto-calibration at the very start of magnetic tape is undesirable. The operator should manually fast forward the tape to a random mid-reel point, perform calibration there and manually rewind back. = Tape calibration = By 1985 tape calibration, absent in the Revox B710, became the de facto industry standard feature for top-of-the-line decks. Reel-to-reel recorders did not need it because quarter-inch tape technology developed slowly, tapes on the market had very close magnetic and electroacoustical properties, and because high-speed recording was by design less sensitive to variations of tape properties. Cassette tape technology, on the contrary, developed rapidly and newly designed premium formulations consistently differed from IEC references or the older, cheaper tapes. The problem was already present in 1983: the B710, aligned at the factory to TDK SA-X ferricobalt Type II tape, had a pronounced treble droop when recording on pure chrome IEC Type II reference. Meinrad Liebert criticized the IEC for failing to impose strict standards: the organization simply followed the market, periodically adapting its set of reference tapes to arbitrarily chosen \\"industry averages\\". Unchecked spread of incompatible cassettes made traditional fixed-bias decks almost unusable for recording; this, according to Liebert, explained sudden demand for calibration features that did not exist in the 1970s. The Revox design team opted for automated calibration, although then prevailing manual calibration was not only cheaper but also more robust. A human operator has an inherent advantage in handling inevitable dropouts, transients and slow fluctuations of the tape's sensitivity. Fully automatic calibration often failed to handle random irregularities and could generate different \\"optimum points\\" for the same tape. Of three or four calibration strategies available, Liebert chose the most flexible and robust constant treble equalization approach - adjusting bias and recording level while keeping recording channel equalization unchanged, with an additional frequency response adjustment at around 4kHz. Thus, unlike more common two-tone arrangement, the Revox used three test tones (the exclusive Nakamichi 1000ZXL used four). Although Studer preferred to name this function alignment, it only affects recording path electronics, and does not perform any mechanical alignment. In spring of 1985 calibration sequence was reverse-engineered by Audio magazine testers, two years later Liebert published first-hand description of the algorithm: * Coarse adjustment of bias (17kHz test tone); * Sensitivity (\\"level\\") adjustment (400Hz test tone); * Fine adjustment of bias (17kHz test tone); * Midrange equalization adjustment (4kHz test tone). The B215 adjusts bias and sensitivity separately in each channel, midrange equalization is performed simultaneously in both channels. Bias and sensitivity are set with 8-bit digital-to-analog converters using binary search algorithm, so each of six adjustments takes up only eight elementary measurements. At 400 Hz each measurement takes around 0,4 s: 0,1 s to advance the tape from recording head gap to replay head, and around 0.3 s to settle down the detector. At 17 kHz measurement takes even longer time because test tone is recorded in short 120ms bursts to suppress unwanted crosstalk from the recording head to the replay head. The complete test sequence, according to Liebert, takes around 25s; independent reviewers quoted even lower time of around 20s. This was still much longer than typical 48 seconds achieved by other auto-calibration decks of the same generation, too close to the subjective limit of 30s.  Tests and reviews  Independent measurements = Specifications published by Studer were highly conservative and did not reveal the deck's true potential. Direct comparison with Japanese competitors was impossible, especially in tape transport parameters. For example, the B215's wow and flutter rating of 0.1% is a maximum value interpreted according to DIN 45507 / IEC 386, while the competitors usually provided far lesser root mean square (RMS) numbers. Independent tests made by the press in the 1980s measured from 0.01% to 0.042% RMS, and from 0.016% to 0.07% maximum. Even the highest RMS value of 0.042% was considered \\"remarkably low\\"; the B215 either exceeded the competition or tied with the Nakamichi Dragon. Craig Stark of Stereo Review admitted that the figures were so close to the limits of test instruments that any measured differences between the decks in this class were probably immaterial. Long-term absolute speed, typically for all quartz-controlled double-capstan transports, was consistently 0.2‚Äì0.3% faster than standard, and almost insensitive to fluctuations in mains voltage. The dynamic range of the B215, understood as the difference between A-weighted bias noise level and maximum output level at 400 Hz, was on par with the Tandberg 3014, but consistently worse than that of the Dragon or the Onkyo 2900. The worst-case dynamic range, measured with quality Type I tape without noise reduction and spectral weighting, equaled only compared to the Dragon's . Both decks had about the same noise floor, determined by the tape's bias noise (hiss) rather than electronics; the Revox lost due to lower maximum output levels. According to Audio and Stereo Review tests, with Type I and Type IV tapes the B215 reached 3% distortion at only 3‚Äì4dB above the Dolby level, while the Dragon could record and reproduce Type IV tapes all the way to +10dB. Howard Roberson of Audio suggested that the narrow overload margin of the Revox was a price paid for its wide frequency response. The B215 user manual specified frequency response of 30‚Äì18000Hz (+2/-3dB) for TypeI tapes and 30‚Äì20000Hz (+2/-3dB) for TypesII and IV. Again, independent tests revealed that performance far exceeded Studer's conservative specifications. Low-level frequency response, measured by Audio magazine at -20 dB relative to Dolby level, extends from 9‚Äì23100 Hz (¬± 3 dB) for Type I and Type IV tapes, and up to 24500 Hz (¬± 3 dB) for Type II tape. At Dolby level, where frequency response is limited mostly by tape saturation, rather than the deck, the Revox measured 23‚Äì14100Hz for TypeI, 23‚Äì16000Hz for TypeII and 24‚Äì17000Hz for Type IV. The use of DolbyC extends the apparent upper boundary at Dolby level to 21‚Äì23kHz. Overall, Revox treble extension is lower than the record set by the Nakamichi 1000ZXL (26‚Äì28 kHz) but is typical for all flagship models of the mid-1980s. The significance of this parameter was often overstated by hi-fi enthusiasts and the consumer- oriented press; professionals did not rate it as important because any professional deck easily exceeded the 20 kHz mark. The quality of calibration, which is a prerequisite for good treble response, was rated very high; the B215 easily \\"erased\\" differences between tapes as different as BASF CR-M (multilayer chrome, recommended by Studer) and TDK SA (single-layer ferricobalt). The low frequency response of tapes recorded and replayed on the B215 has a prominent comb-like pattern below 30 Hz. These \\"head bumps\\", indicating strong contour effect, appear only during recording. Replay frequency response, measured with test tapes, is exemplararily flat, on a par with the Nakamichi Dragon, and noticeably better than the Tandberg 3014. = Overall evaluation = Reviewers between 1985 and 1988 unanimously gave the B215 excellent marks, particularly for the quality of its tape transport. Len Feldman of Modern Electronics wrote that \\"... on an overall basis ... it is, truly, a Rolls-Royce among cassette recorders. Its marque evades prestige. Moreover, it's built to last, and to go on meeting or exceeding all of its published specifications after many years of use.\\" In comparative tests by Stereo Review (United States, 1988) and Audio (West Germany, 1985), the B215 was ranked one of the two best decks on the market, the other being the Nakamichi Dragon. The B215 surpassed the Dragon in the mechanical department, having a simpler, robust, durable tape transport. The B215 was losing to the Dragon in dynamic range and subjective level and the spectrum of noise; other subjectively detected differences in sonic signatures were insignificant and could be interpreted in favor of either contestant. Sonically, both the B215 and the Dragon surpassed equally expensive ASC and Tandberg decks and the much cheaper flagship models by Harman Kardon, Onkyo and TEAC. The Dragon had an edge over the B215 and all other competitors in its automatic azimuth correction system. The Dragon could easily \\"digest\\" tapes recorded on other, often misaligned, equipment. Its six-channel, azimuth-sensing replay head remained a unicorn, an unprecedented pinnacle of cassette technology. Apart from a short-lived Marantz effort, no competitor ever tried to replicate it. Production and aftermarket servicing of azimuth-sensing heads proved too difficult even for Nakamichi, and instead of developing the Dragon line, the company began production of unidirectional auto-reversing decks that physically flipped the cassette instead of reversing the transport.

Toponymy  The term \\"Millette\\" turns out to be a family name of French origin.Mgr Cyprien Tanguay, Dictionnaire g√©n√©alogique des familles canadiennes, Volume 6, p. 40 √† 43, √âditions √âlys√©e, 1975. The term Millette evokes the memory of a Milette business family who for several generations operated a flour and carding mill, then who operated a cooler on the bank of this river during the first half of the 20th century. Substituted for the term Sainte-Marguerite to designate this watercourse, the term Millette turns out to be a variant of the spelling of the surname Millet. In the course of history, this spelling has two main variants: either the final \\"te\\" and the letter L single or double. This spelling Millet appeared in 1656 in New-France where several descendants of the surname Millet settled between Montreal and Trois-Rivi√®res; another group made roots in the region of Quebec City. In the 1666 census of the government of Trois-Rivi√®res, two individuals with the surname Millet are listed: Pierre Millet (hired in 1656) aged 55, domestic working for Pierre Sonillas, as well as Nicolas Millet, known as Merendas or Marandas (hired in 1658) aged 32, a servant with Antoine Le Maistre, known as Lamorille.Census of 1666 of the Trois-Rivi√®res Government.Quebec names and places, work by the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary. According to a 1926 county map of Saint-Maurice, the mouth of the Millette river corresponds to that of the Sainte-Marguerite river. In 1978, the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec replaced the toponymic designation \\"Rivi√®re Sainte- Marguerite\\" by \\"Rivi√®re Millette\\". According to Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, this third river from the western limit of the Commune served as a marker for the Sainte-Marguerite or Bouvinet seigneury in 1679. Nevertheless, this river remained anonymous for a long time. The Sainte-Marguerite stream, the mouth of which is located southwest of that of the Millette river (ie south of the Laviolette bridge), should not therefore be confused with the authentic Rivi√®re Sainte-Marguerite whose toponym was replaced by Rivi√®re Millette. The toponym \\"rivi√®re Millette\\" was formalized on August 17, 1978 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym \\"Rivi√®re Millette\\".

Biography  Orfitus came from a noble family, and started his career at a relatively young age. He held a posts of quaestor and praetor before becoming consularis of Sicilia under Constantius II and Constans (340/350). He supported Constantius in a war against Magnentius and was appointed to the office of proconsul of Africa after Constantius got control over it. In 353-355 he was praefectus urbi, succeeding Neratius Cerealis. In 357 he got urban prefecture again; at this time Constantius visited Rome in 357. In 359 he was replaced by Flavius Leontius. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, \\"he was a man of wisdom, it is true, and highly skilled in legal practice, but less equipped with the adornment of the liberal arts than became a man of noble rank\\".Ammianus Marcellinus, xiv vi.1. Various roman corporas erected statues in his honor. A devout pagan, he was a Pontifex Deae Vestae and Pontifex Dei Solis and during his second term as the praefectus urbi he built a shrine of Apollo. In 364 he was accused of peculation by baker Terentius. Because of that Orfitus was exiled and had his property confiscated, but soon he was recalled through the influence of Vulcacius Rufinus. He died around 369. His wife, Constantia, was related to the house of Constantine; according to Alan Cameron, she probably was a daughter of Hannibalianus and Constantina.Alan Cameron (1996). \\"Orfitus and Constantius: a note on Roman gold-glasses,\\" in Journal of Roman archaeology, p. 301.

Aureliu Manea, c. 1968 Life Aureliu Manea studied theatre directing under Radu Penciulescu (1930-2019) at the Ion Luca Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography in Bucharest, graduating in 1968. The same year, he made his debut as a director with a highly original production of Henrik Ibsen's Rosmersholm at the State Theatre of Sibiu. Ibsen, Rosmersholm, dir. Aureliu Manea, 1968 He went on to stage a large number of productions, including works by Shakespeare, Sophocles, Seneca, Chekhov, Arnold Wesker, Racine, Jean Cocteau, Racine, and Georg B√ºchner, as well as Romanian classics, such as Ion Luca Caragiale's A Stormy Night and Tudor Mu»ôatescu's Titanic Waltz, and plays by contemporary Romanian dramatist Teodor Mazilu (1930-1980). Suffering from ill health, he withdrew from theatre life in 1991 and was a patient at the Neuropsychiatric Recuperation and Rehabilitation Centre, Galda de Jos, Transylvania, until his death in 2014. In 1993, he was awarded the UNITER (Uniunea TeatralƒÉ din Rom√¢nia) Prize for Lifetime Achievement. In 2014, the Turda Municipal Theatre was renamed the Aureliu Manea National Theatre in honour of the director, who staged many of his productions there. Work as a director Franco-Romanian theatre critic likens Manea to Argentinian director \\"maudit\\" Victor Garcia and describes him as an exponent of \\"absolute theatre, incandescent theatre,\\" whose genius was recognised and admired at the time by Jean Genet and Peter Brook.Banu, 2012, 5. Banu followed Manea's career from the very beginning, writing a review of his first production, Rosmersholm, staged at the State Theatre of Sibiu in 1968. According to Banu, Manea's production succeeded in creating an intense sense of unease in both cast and audience by embodying Ibsen as a ghostly presence moving among the actors on stage.Banu, 2012, 7. Manea continued to stage innovative, visually arresting productions at theatres around Romania, including Racine's Britannicus at the Piatra Neam»õ Youth Theatre in 1969.Interview with Aureliu Manea by Martin Leibovici, CeahlƒÉul, 21 October 1969. http://dordeneamt.ro/2018/08/28/evocari-regizorul- aureliu-manea-la-teatrul-tineretului/ Racine, Britannicus, directed by Aureliu Manea, Youth Theatre, Piatra Neam»õ, 1969 Twelfth Night, directed by Aureliu Manea, Cluj National Theatre, 1975 In 1975, Manea's production of Twelfth Night, staged at the Cluj National Theatre, with sets by Paul Salzberger, drew standing ovations.Viorica Samson Manea. In Manea (2020, xi). The following year, hisMacbeth, staged at the Ploie»ôti Theatre in 1976, drew on Japanese Kabuki theatre, with a stark set that evoked a desolate, snowy landscape, dominated by a wooden throne symbolising Macbeth's barbarous, brutal power, \\"adorned with furs and animal heads, which were trophies of earlier conquests and omens of the death that was to come.\\"Matei-Chesnoiu (2006, 176) A contemporary reviewer saw the production as a \\"cosmic\\" clash \\"between Good and Evil, between Life and Death, between order and chaos, or between nature and the human being as a representative of social convulsion.\\"Mira Iosif, \\"Macbeth de Shakespeare\\", Teatrul 5 (1976, 44), quoted in Matei-Chesnoiu (2006, 176) During his career, Manea staged only one production in Bucharest, however, since he saw the actors there as \\"too big\\" and preferred to work with lesser-known actors, who were not given to displays of ego and did not contest his direction.Viorica Samson Manea. In Manea (2020, xi). As a director, he saw theatre not as a vehicle for individual actors, but rather as the \\"art of solidarity\\", \\"a ritual of togetherness\\" uniting actors and audience.Viorica Samson Manea. In Manea (2020, xi). Constantin DrƒÉgƒÉnescu and Aristide Teica in Aureliu Manea's production of Macbeth, Ploie»ôti State Theatre, 1976 Writing In 1983, Manea published Energiile spectacolului (The Energies of Performance),Manea (1983) a series of short meditations on directors (Liviu Ciulei, Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook) and directing; playwrights (Sophocles, Gogol, Shakespeare, Aristophanes, Racine, Strindberg, Carlo Goldoni, Brecht, Chekhov, Moli√®re, Marivaux); actors and acting; the ritual and psychological laws governing stage properties; the mechanisms of attention during performance (the director is an \\"engineer of attention\\"); theatre as officiation of a sacral rite; directorial intention, improvisation, chance, and the \\"entropic phenomenon\\" in theatrical performance; and the fundamental enigma and ephemerality of the theatrical act. In Spectacole imaginare,English translation: Imaginary Performances in Shakespeare. Manea (2020) published in 1986, Manea takes nineteen plays by Shakespeare (Richard II, The Merchant of Venice, The Tempest, As You Like It, Two Gentlemen of Verona, Julius Caesar, Much Ado About Nothing, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labours Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, King John, Richard III, The Taming of the Shrew, Titus Andronicus, Twelfth Night, Othello, Macbeth, Hamlet) and imagines a production that might penetrate the enigma of each play, its timeless human mystery. The \\"Imaginary Performances\\" are followed by a series of \\"Confessions\\", in which Manea meditates on his work as a director, on his past productions and work with specific actors and playwrights, on the puppet theatre, on performance as a ritual of profound communion between audience and actors, on the giants of universal drama (Aeschylus, Goethe). In 2012, Viorica Samson Manea, the director's sister, edited and published a collection of Manea's writings: the trilogy of plays Penelope Falls to Thinking, The Theatre Rehearsal, and The Fairy from the East, short stories, and an essay (\\"Man's Solitude, or Narcissus\\").Aureliu Manea, Texte regƒÉsite, ed.

He was the first military person to hold the office.  Early life  Sinaga was born on 1924, at a small community named Sinaga Uruk in the Urat Village, Samosir Sub-District, which at that time was part of the Bataklanden District, Tapanuli Residency, Gouvernenment of Sumatra. He was born as the son of Hiskia Sinaga and Victoria n√©e Samosir. Sinaga entered the People's School in 1931. He graduated from the school in 1935, and continued his study at the Schakel School (Dutch language school) in the Nainggolan village. He graduated in 1940 and planned to study at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (Junior High School), but was halted due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies.  Military career  In 1943, Sinaga joined the Giyugun voluntary forces. After the Indonesian independence, he joined the Badan Keamanan Rakyat (People's Security Bureau), which would become the forerunner to the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Sinaga moved back to Tapanuli in 1946, and became the commander of the Brigade XI of the Sumatran Command, with the rank of Second Lieutenant. After the recognition of the independence of Indonesia in 1950, he was assigned a post in the Bukit Barisan command as aide-de-camp with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He retained the position until 1966, and from 1966 until 1968, he became the Assistant VI in the command.  Regent of North Tapanuli  Election = Sinaga nominated himself as the candidate for the Regent of North Tapanuli. He was supported by Golkar, Catholic Party, and the Nahdlatul Ulama fraction inside the Regional People's Representative Council of North Sumatra. Other candidates, such as Daulat Sitorus and Bonar Sitanggang, were supported by the Indonesian Christian Party, while M.U. Situmeang was supported by the IPKI fraction. Elections were held on 1 February 1968. Sinaga obtained 9 votes, Daulat Sitorus obtained 9 votes, M.U. Situmeang obtained 5 votes, while Bonar Sitanggang obtained 9 votes. Even though there was a tie between Sinaga and Sitorus, the council unanonimously agreed to elect Sinaga as the new regent of North Tapanuli, replacing the acting regent A.V. Siahaan. Sinaga was officially inaugurated as the regent on 31 May 1968. Prior to the election of a new regent in 1973, Sinaga was inaugurated as the acting regent of North Tapanuli on 7 August 1973. The council unanimously elected Sinaga as the regent of North Tapanuli on 12 December 1973, and he was inaugurated for his second term on 14 February 1974. = Infrastructure Development = During his first year as the regent of North Tapanuli, Sinaga faced difficult problems regarding to the infrastructure development in the region. According to Sinaga's assessment, the mentality of the people in the region were influenced by \\"pseudo-ideologies\\" and caused the government to attach importance to the ideological development rather than infrastructure development. This caused the region to experience extreme poverty and inflations. Sinaga began his project for the infrastructure development by enacting land acquisition for tourism in Tutuk Siadong, Ajibata and Simanindo. The funds were obtained from the Government of North Sumatra as interest-free loans. Other attempts to increase tourism in the area was by building airports. Sinaga approached the Department of Transportation regarding the plans to build airports in the vicinity of Lake Toba. In 1978, the attempt came to fruition when a small airport was finally constructed in Ajibata, about 10 km from Lake Toba. Other projects that were constructed during his leadership was the construction of a large reservoir, which began since 1976 in the valley of Sideak-Tanjungan. The reservoirs was planned to be four kilometers long, with a width of 50 meters, and a depth of 20 meters. Even though this project was not finished during his term, Sinaga continued this project even after his resignation from the position. = 1971 legislative election = During the 1971 Indonesian legislative election, the headquarters of the Indonesian Army predicted that Golkar, the ruling party, would not win in North Tapanuli. The Governor of North Sumatra, Marah Halim Harahap, promised Sinaga a trip to Japan fully covered by Harahap, while the commander of the Bukit Barisan Territory Command, Leo Lopulissa, promised Sinaga a Range Rover Classic. Golkar would won in North Tapanuli by 85%, and Sinaga went on a trip to Japan and got a new Range Rover Classic.  Family  Sinaga was married to Listeria n√©e Silalahi in September 1951. The marriage resulted in six children.

The stadium has a capacity of 2,000 (200 covered), and is largely terracing. It is host to the men's West of Scotland Football League football team Troon F.C., a former Junior football side, and this is a ground Troon F.C. have called home since their formation after the Second World War ahead of the 1946‚Äì47 season. Portland Park has always been known for having a magnificent playing surface, and as a result has often been used by some of the biggest teams in the world in training camps and friendly matches. Thanks to this, Portland Park is famous for one big claim to fame ‚Äì it is the only park in Scotland which both Pel√© and Eus√©bio have graced. History Troon Athletic, and Troon Academicals before them, first called Station Park their home ground, a park in Troon located from the Station Hill to the Yorke Road bridge until 1923. From 1923 onwards they were inhabitants of the brand new Portland Park. Before moving into the new modernised facility beside the seafront, Troon Academicals F.C. had spent most of their existence (from 1889 until 1923) playing at Station Park before Portland Park was constructed. Up until its closure, the old park was basic at best and had one of the poorer playing surfaces in Junior Football. In 1923, it was demolished and replaced with the clubhouse and car park for Troon Links Golf Course. =Pel√© and Brazil= Edson Arantes do Nascimento (better known worldwide as Pel√©) once graced the hallowed turf at Portland Park, Troon. In a training camp to acclimatise the players ahead of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, Brazil (with Garrincha, Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostao, Zito) stayed at the Marine Hotel in Troon & the team trained at our very own Portland Park. Brazil played Scotland at Hampden Park on June, 25, 1966, as part of the South American side‚Äôs World Cup warm-up schedule. The game finished 1-1 with Stevie Chalmers scoring for Scotland in the first minute before Servilio equalised for Brazil on 15 minutes. =Eus√©bio and Portugal= Eus√©bio da Silva Ferreira (most commonly known as simply Eus√©bio) also played at Portland Park, as his club side Benfica trained ahead of a European Cup Quarter-Final against Celtic at Celtic ParkParkhead on 12th November 1969. Eusebio‚Äôs side were to lose the match 3-0, before winning 3-0 at the Est√°dio da Luz in the return leg. Billy McNeill‚Äôs Celtic eventually progressed courtesy of a coin toss. =Lisbon Lions= The legendary Jock Stein brought Celtic‚Äôs European Cup winning Lisbon Lions team to Portland Park in May 1969 for a friendly match. European Cup winners John Clark, Bobby Murdoch, Stevie Chalmers and Lou Macari were in the Celtic ranks that day, which the Hoops triumphed in 7-2. Facilities The stadium can hold up to 2,000 spectators, with one covered enclosure holding 500 supporters. This enclosure is adjacent to the main clubhouse, containing a large bar & function room, hospitality lounge and the dressing rooms. Opposite the main enclosure is two steps of terracing, with an open terrace located at the \\"road end\\". Behind the opposite goal is the floodlit training park. Accessibility The ground is only walking distance away from Troon railway station. By road, it is located near to the A79 leading onto the A77, M77 and M8.

Project Medishare is a 501(c)(3), non-profit organization registered in the State of Florida. It was founded by Dr. Barth Green and Arthur Fournier from the University of Miami School of Medicine. The organization was created in 1994 to improve healthcare in Haiti. Since then, it has been committed to help its Haitian partners by establishing and funding sustainable programs, providing technology and equipment to hospitals, clinics, and other affiliated programs and training of Haitian physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals. Project Medishare‚Äôs focus program include Community Health, Maternal Health, Child Health and Nutrition, and Medical Training and Education. The geographic areas served by the organization include Port-au-Prince and the Central Plateau in Haiti. The organization provides direct beneficiaries for more than 80,000 people every year.  History  For assessing the healthcare situation in Haiti, Dr. Barth Green and Dr. Arthur Fournier founded Project Medishare for Haiti, Inc. in 1994. The first team of faculty was assembled by both the doctors from the University of Miami Schools of Medicine and Nursing for exploring ways through which the health conditions of the Haitian people could be improved. After their first trip, the organization forged partnerships with allied health professionals and physicians for providing quality healthcare for the people of Haiti. On January 12th, 2010, when Haiti was struck by an earthquake, Dr. Green, along with a team of 11 doctors were the first to arrive for help. In less than 24 hours, a critical care hospital and 300 trauma beds were set up on the grounds of Port-au-Prince Airport by Project Medishare at the request of the Haitian President, Ren√© Pr√©val. By June 2010, the organization had treated more than 30,000 earthquake victims. After the earthquake, the organization expanded for building a tent hospital similar to a MASH unit. The field hospital then created is, as of today, one of the largest functioning urgent care hospitals in the country. The hospital has an emergency room, an ICU, an operating room, and a pediatrics unit. It also has inpatient and outpatient operations.  Voluntary work partners  Project Medishare accepts medical volunteers from all over the world.

In January 2010, World Emblem International, Miami, donated services and products to Project Medishare. World Emblem also printed t-shirts with the ‚ÄúSave Haiti Saturday‚Äù and ‚ÄúProject Medishare‚Äù logos. Many restaurants and bars across the US also donated a percentage of their Saturday revenue for Save Haiti Saturday, a fundraising initiative for Project Medshare‚Äôs earthquake relief efforts. United Way granted $40,000 grant to Project Medishare to continue to fund medical supplies and medical care in Haiti. Y√©le Haiti Foundation partnered with Project Medishare to provide the first high-resolution CT Scanner in Haiti. The scanner was made available for all patients regardless of their financial resources. A $5 million financial support from American Red Cross with $2 million additional funding enabled Hospital Bernard Mevs/Project Medishare to keep their doors open for the people in Haiti in need of services. An additional $3.6 million was donated to Project Medishare to support their relief efforts by the American Red Cross in 2012. The amount was used to cover costs, including operating expenses and administrative fees of critical care and trauma service facility in the country.Respiratory technician John Rendle, with the University of Miami Global Institute's Project Medishare, provides medical assistance to an earthquake survivor in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Justin Bieber donated a portion of all his proceeds from his album in 2012 to Project Medishare. He also performed at the Massey Hall for a charity fundraising show.

Contributions  In 2006, Project Medishare donated a generator to Haiti. In April 2010, a joint effort was made by Miami Dolphins and Sun Life Stadium Haiti Relief Fund with Project Medishare to help the Haitian families to connect with their families. Two communication facilities were established in Port au Prince and Little Haiti, enabling the Haitian family members to connect with their relatives in Miami. The videoconferencing platform used was Cisco TelePresence. Project Medishare worked with the Hospital de la Paix in Port-au-Prince to establish a surgical training program, focused on training surgeons to repair clefts and treat burns. A pediatric neurosurgery training program was also initiated by the organization. The only critical-care and trauma hospital in Haiti was established by Project Medishare when the organization renovated the partially destroyed Hospital Bernard Mevs in Port-au-Prince. The hospital also includes a comprehensive rehabilitation component and a training program for Haitians. More than 300 limbs have been made by the organization‚Äôs prosthetic program, and an amputee soccer program to reconnect the Haitians with their national sport is also created by Project Medishare. In July 2013, a breast cancer treatment program was launched in Port-au-Prince. The program was initiated to address the demand for breast cancer care in Haiti. Within two years, the organization was able to provide care to 139 patients with breast cancer.

In 1797 he escaped to Trier, secretly returning to Luxembourg the following year and living there clandestinely until 18 January 1800, when his sentence was quashed.

The union was founded in 1891, at a conference in P√∂√üneck, which brought together various local unions. In its early years, the appropriate degree of centralisation was highly controversial, but a centralised organisation gradually emerged. The union acquired the Textilarbeiter newspaper, and made it the official journal. By 1900, the union had 42,742 members, but it then increased its membership fees, and membership dropped back to 27,548. In 1903 and 1904, the union led the Crimmitschauer Strike, in support of a maximum ten-hour working day. This severely strained the union's finances and ultimately proved unsuccessful, but it led to a rapid increase in membership. From 1905, the union set up a regional structure, with each region led by a full-time organiser. Until the end of World War I, the union had a reputation for being very moderate, but a majority of the union supported the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919. It was a founding affiliate of the General German Trade Union Confederation in 1919. Membership peaked at 704,000 in 1922, but the Great Depression led to high unemployment in the textile industry, and union membership fell rapidly. By 1928, it had fallen to 310,941, of whom, 179,767 were women, a very high proportion for the time. Membership density was not as strong as other sectors, as Christian trade unions recruited well in the industry. By 1932, membership was down to 220,000. The union was banned by the Nazi government in 1933, and after World War II, workers in the sector were represented by the Textile and Clothing Union.

He was Speaker of the 3rd Legislative Assembly of the Wisconsin Territory. Earlier in his life he served as a member of the North Carolina Senate and House of Commons, and was involved in a disputed 1835 congressional election in North Carolina against James Graham. Early career Born in Burke County, North Carolina, Newland and his brothers ran a mail coach business using horse-drawn wagons with state contracts. Newland became involved in politics and was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1826, representing Burke County. He would be re-elected for 1827, 1828, and 1829. In 1830, he was Burke County's representative in the North Carolina Senate, and, in 1831, he was elected to the North Carolina Council of State. He was appointed a Colonel in the North Carolina Militia sometime before 1830, and was made a Brigadier General in late 1832. Newland was a supporter of Andrew Jackson in his bid for the presidency in 1828 and remained aligned with Democratic politics. In 1833, Newland made his first bid for election to Congress. He ran in North Carolina's 12th congressional district as an anti-nullification Jacksonian Democrat. He came in third place, behind the incumbent pro-nullification Democrat Samuel Price Carson and National Republican James Graham, who won the seat. Disputed election His second attempt at election to Congress, in 1835, resulted in a controversy that was appealed to the House of Representatives. James Graham was running for re- election and had declared himself for Martin Van Buren for the presidency in 1836. Newland ran in support of Tennessee Senator Hugh Lawson White. The initial results appeared to show Graham with a narrow seven-vote margin of victory, but Newland presented evidence that ballots had been left out of the count because they had been placed in the wrong ballot box. Newland petitioned the United States House of Representatives to resolve the dispute. The House Committee on Elections, with a Democratic Majority, found in Newland's favor that the misplaced ballots should be added to his total, giving him an apparent victory by 12 votes. However, the issue languished in the House with months of debate. Ultimately, the House voted 114 to 87 that Graham was not elected, however the vote in favor of seating Newland failed 99 to 100 and the seat was declared vacant in March of 1836. A special election was subsequently held in August of 1836. By this time, Van Buren was the nominee of the Democrats, and Newland declared himself a supporter. This time Graham won handily, defeating Newland by 1,600 votes. Wisconsin In 1837, after the inauguration of Van Buren as President, he appointed Newland a surveyor of public lands in the Wisconsin Territory. Newland moved to Wisconsin and settled near Blue River, in what was then part of Iowa County. At the time, Iowa County encompassed all the land in Wisconsin south of the Wisconsin River and west of the river's major bend. Newland again became involved with politics and, in June of 1840, he was on the Democratic slate of candidates for the Legislative Assembly. He was elected to represent Iowa County for the Third Legislative Assembly (1840-1842). At the first session, he was chosen as Speaker of the House of Representatives and elected on the first ballot. He served in that capacity for both sessions of the Third Assembly. At the conclusion of the Third Assembly, Newland relocated to Milwaukee, where he was elected to the Fourth Assembly as a member of the Territorial Council (upper chamber). He was a candidate to be a delegate to Wisconsin's first constitutional convention in 1846, but was not elected. After Wisconsin achieved statehood, Newland went to work in Sheboygan County, and resided at Greenbush. He served on the Board of Directors of the Sheboygan and Fond du Lac Plank Road Company and, in 1853, was appointed harbor agent at Sheboygan. Death Finding himself in difficult financial circumstances, Newland traveled to Washington, D.C., in 1857, in an attempt to obtain an appointment from the new President, James Buchanan. After a few months there without success, on the morning of December 20, 1857, Newland's body was discovered in the canal near 9th Street. His death was ruled an accidental drowning by a Washington, D.C., jury, but it was widely reported as suicide. Personal life and family Newland married Cynthia Ann McDonald and had at least two children. Their son, David, died in infancy. Their daughter, Kate, married Jacob Sproat, and, after his death, married John Dawer. Cynthia Newland was a maternal aunt of famous sculptor Vinnie Ream.

It has taken much inspiration from the Harry Potter series and the video games Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis and Octopath Traveler.  Releases  The full version of the game is currently in development, with a proposed commercial release date of 2022. Several demos have already been released on itch.io, with a new one coming to Steam in November 2020. Debuting on Steam in November 2020, Lawmage Academy v0.6 will feature a graphics improvement, rebalanced gameplay, and a rework of the core mechanics. The playtime will be shorter than v0.5, but the overall experience is expected to improve. Currently, content creators are playtesting the demo before its release. Since its summer 2019 release on itch, version 0.5 of Lawmage Academy was released. Compared to v0.4, it had more content than the previous version and fixed all of the major bugs present, allowing for a great experience and receiving many positive reviews. Version 0.1 was the initial release of the demos and introduced the story and core mechanics. Verinius released updates with bugfixes in versions 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.  Synopsis  The game set in the fantasy realm of Magusgaia, a magic school known as \\"Lawmage Academy\\", the place who can learn magic and training students to become one of the Lawmages. Each one playable character if you choose the genders, items and four houses, you‚Äôll spend your days attending classes and learning new abilities. You‚Äôll also wander around campus, meet a variety of characters, craft items using ingredients you‚Äôve gathered, and even leave the safety of the school to explore diverse locations filled with monsters, mystery, and danger.  Development and Submissions  The developer concepts the idea about \\"a certain magic school game with a nonlinear story\\" once he wanted to make a fantasy game with choices and experiences, it was given the name \\"Lawmage Academy\\". Around March 2018, he started using the RPG Maker MV game engine and practicing his idea after watching tutorials, which he counts for ‚Äúone hour a day for one year‚Äù commitment. He studied level design, writing dialogue, world building, choices, working as an indie dev, interior design, and other skills, but he lacks of programming and arts. Later in 2019, the pre-alpha demo was released on June before it exhibited at the Electronic Sports and Gaming Summit (ESGS) 2019, where they were part of Indie Fiesta 2019, a local games exhibit directed by International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Philippines board member Gwen Foster.  Composers  Tyler Cline composed the new main theme and battle music, and also several composers will served in the game including Will Geraint Drake, Lewmoth, Philemon Holmes, Peter Jones, and Dibur. Some updates would release the following year.

CBL also utilizes Team-based learning (or Active Collaborative Learning, ACL) and Problem-based learning paradigms. Competition-based learning involves a team of students in an open-ended assignments or projects that resembles some problems students may face at the work place or in the real-world. However, the performance is being evaluated on the final completion of the project or task assigned in the course as a comparison to other groups. The aspiration is to create motivation in the students to come up with the best overall project. CBL learning relies on the competition results. Furthermore, CBL implements a reward system upon the completion of the task assigned.  Background and Advantages The real-world is competitive and competition has been used in teaching and learning throughout the human history around the world. Countries such as England, Singapore, and South Korea have special education programs which cater for specialist students, prompting charges of academic elitism. Currently, academic competitions are popular. According to The Institute of Competition Sciences retrieved on May 30, 2020, over 4,000,000 students participate in educational competitions in over 500 competitions across all academic subject they monitor in their network. Many practitioners in education claim that CBL can enhance students' motivation to work harder and the learning outcomes since they are more excited about the project and potential rewards. Competition is good in the sense that it discourages complacency and raises students‚Äô consciousness of the value of good outcomes. As a result, the keener the competition, the higher the output among students. This is manifested not only in high individual averages, but in overall high class averages. It is, therefore, a very effective tool to keep your high achievers achieving.The Value of Competition in the Classroom Other benefits of CBL include the enhancement of problem-solving, creative thinking, and teamwork skills. Examples Some articles reporting competitions in across various academic subjects include * EFFECTS OF COMPETITION IN EDUCATION: A CASE STUDY IN AN E-LEARNING ENVIRONMENT - by Iv√°n Cantador, Jos√© M. Conde, Departamento de Ingenier√≠a Inform√°tica, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid * Learning through Competitions ‚Äì Competition-Based Learning (CBL) - by CJ Chung, from CTL (Center for Teaching & Learning) Conference at Lawrence Technological University, April 2008 * A robotic competition: a classroom experience in a vocational school - by MARZIA PISCIOTTA1, BRUNO VELLO1, CLAUDIO BORDO1 AND GIOVANNA MORGAVI2 from ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES * Utilizing Project- Based Learningand Competition to DevelopStudent Skills and Interest inProducing Quality Food Items - by Willard, M.W. Duffrin, from Vol. 2, 2003‚ÄîJOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE EDUCATION * The Big List of Student Contests and Competitions - from We Are Teachers, weareteachers.com Here is a comprehensive list of competitions that can be used for classes or after-school extracurricular programs. Hackathons can be examples of CBL. The purpose of a hackathon is a for a group of software developers to work together on a collaborative project. Most hackathons are competitions where several teams are competing to create prototypes that innovate on a theme or improve upon an existing project. Criticism Some people think in class competition is not good, since it is discouraging when others always seem to do better than you. Critics of competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as Alfie Kohn, argue that competition actually has a net negative influence on the achievement levels of students. Competition can easily lead to stress, anxiety and disappointment, especially if it promotes academic competition between \\"individual\\" students.Classroom Competition by Will English, Retrieved on May 31, 2020 This stress can force students to push back other interests and extracurricular activities, leading to an unbalanced school life. A poor competition result may affect students' emotions or hurt their confidence. If a competition does not provide students with a goal that is attainable for nearly everyone, the activity becomes unbalanced, with some jumping ahead and others ending up left in the dust. This is the kind of competition that will lead to a diminished desire to participate in related activities or subject fields. An unhealthy competition may be one that is focused on winning instead of moving toward on learning a new skill or working as a team.Disadvantages of competition in education process, Retrieved on May 31, 2020 Therefore, the design of CBL methodologies needs to hone in driving students to collaboratively achieve learning outcomes, not just winning the competition.

A senior lecturer in the Department of Oceanography at the University of Cape Town, she is particularly interested in the role of oceans in regulating biogeochemical cycles and how their dysregulation contributes to climate change. She was honoured in the World Economic Forum Young Scientists Class of 2020, and a P-Rating from the National Research Foundation, which recognizes that the scientist's work will likely have high impact.  Early life  Fawcett was born in Benoni, Gauteng, and attended Benoni High School. She went on to study Earth and planetary science at Harvard University (2006) and completed a PhD at Princeton (2012) where she later held a postdoctoral fellowship (2012-2015).  Career  In 2015, Fawcett was appointed a lecturer in oceanography at the University of Cape Town. She has worked to build up a diverse research group, aware of the discrimination still faced by female scientists. From 2016, she has participated in the SEAmester scheme that aims to train up postdoctoral oceanography researchers. In her doctorate Fawcett investigated the relationship between nitrogen and populations of phytoplankton in upwelling ecosystems of the Sargasso Sea. She has continued to work on these relationships, concentrating on the subpolar North Atlantic and Southern Ocean as areas of particular importance. The sequestration of carbon through the biological pump in these regions may be an important regulatory of the global ocean system, but the dynamics of the nitrogen- phytoplankton system limit its efficiency. Much of Fawcett's works is based on measurements of stable nitrogen isotopes. Fawcett is also addressing the lack of research in the Benguela Upwelling System, which is important for the biodiversity and economy of the region. She is also primary investigator for the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). In 2017, she received the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR) Young Researchers Award and the Claude Leon Merit Award for Early-Career Researchers. She was also distinguished as one of the Top 200 Young South Africans by the Mail and Guardian and received a NRF P-rating meaning her early career had suggested she would go on to become \\"a future international leader in [her] field\\". In 2018, the University of Cape Town awarded her its College of Fellows Young Researcher Award. In 2020, the World Economic Forum added Fawcett to its group of 25 young researchers at the \\"forefront of scientific discovery\\" for that year on account of her research on \\"ocean chemistry and biology in climate\\" and the \\"impacts of human activities on marine environments.\\"  References  Category:South African women scientists Category:Oceanographers Category:Climatologists Category:University of Cape Town alumni Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Sarah Fawcett"},{"id":"64108851","text":"Manda II is a mountain of the Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand India also called Manda south.

Design and development  On January 25, 1945, Messerschmitt proposed the P.1107/I jet- powered bomber. The P.1107/I was designed using experiences from the company's earlier Me 264 jet bomber, and was to be powered by four BMW 018 or Heinkel HeS 109-011 turbojet engines mounted in twin-pods under the wings. The steel and Duralumin fuselage was to have been taken from the Me 264, while the wings were to be constructed of wood. Landing gear was to consist of two large diameter main wheels which retracted into the fuselage and twin nose wheels, and the empennage was to have a high set tailplane. Fuel tanks were to be carried in the mid fuselage and wings. The pressurized, heated cabin would have housed the crew of four, as well as the radio and radar equipment. Offensive armament was to be a bomb load of 4,000 kg carried in the fuselage, no defensive armament was proposed. Later on the design would be refined as the P.1107/II. This variant would have been of all metal construction, and the engines would have been relocated to the wing roots. A V-tail was to have been fitted. The prototype of the P.1107/II was in the early stages of construction when the war ended. Drawings exist of a third variant, labeled IX-122. This variant is depicted without a tailplane and with a much larger wing. The main landing gear was to retract into the wings, while the single nose wheel would have rotated 90 degrees before retracting backward under the cabin.  Variants  P.1107/I, initial proposal. Metal fuselage and wooden wings, podded engines, and a T-tail. Bomber and reconnaissance variants were proposed. P.1107/II, refined proposal. All-metal construction, engines buried in the wing roots, and a V-tail. Construction of the prototype was halted by the end of the war. P.1107 (IX-122), tailless variant with a larger wing and redesigned landing gear. Me 462, proposed RLM designation for the P.1107.

They have worked collaboratively since 1997.  Education and teaching  John Beagles studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, London and Graham Ramsay studied at the University of Leeds. Both artists then moved to Glasgow to complete their MFAs at Glasgow School of Art where they also began their collaborative practice. Beagles teaches at Edinburgh University, where he is Director of Postgraduate Studies for Art, as well as Head of the MFA and MA in Contemporary Art Practice. Ramsay teaches on the MFA Programme at Glasgow School of Art. Both artists have also taught at a wide variety of art schools and universities across the UK and internationally.  Exhibitions and artworks  Two key interweaving currents of interest inform the work of Beagles & Ramsay. Firstly the reoccurring use of a kind of fictionalised self-portraiture and secondly, in broad terms, a humorous examination of aspects of contemporary consumer culture. Since 1997 they have explored these themes in a series of sculptures, installations, video, performance and drawings, which have been exhibited nationally and internationally. Their presence within the work has always been a performed presence; using doppelgangers has been a means of speaking in alternate voices or drawing upon multiple personae. Producing and inhabiting these shifting personae, has allowed them the conceptual space to explore aspects of contemporary culture ‚Äì such as consumerism, political disenfranchisement, and the cult of celebrity - without the restrictions of a singular, authoritative voice. 'Trilogy' (2000) has the two artists appearing as geriatric versions of themselves trapped in a series of domestic interiors whilst voicing the lyrics to well known songs by Madonna and Prince. This video has been shown in numerous venues including 'Videodrome II' at the New Museum, New York. In the ‚ÄòGlitter Desert Island‚Äô series (Tramway, Glasgow 2005, and MOT International, London 2007) they assumed the pose and gaze of the rarefied dandy, reclining on a gold glitter desert island complete with fake palm trees, while ‚ÄòWe Are The People ‚Äì Suck On This‚Äô (ICA, London 2000) featured a restaged, downbeat version of Martin Scorsese‚Äôs Taxi Driver. Ramsay was dressed and styled to appear like the Taxi Driver character Travis Bickle and handed a petition into the British Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street. Their 2003 solo show, ‚ÄòDead of Night' at Gasworks Gallery, London featured an ambitious theatrical installation containing a pair of hand crafted ventriloquist dummy doppelgangers. This work is also informed by research into earlier, pre- modernist traditions within art, specifically the counter tradition of the carnivalesque. The artists within this tradition were adept at synthesising their visual aesthetic with political allegories and satirical content. The influence of this tradition is perhaps most clearly seen in the ongoing series of drawings ‚ÄòUnrealised Dreams‚Äô which were first shown in the Scottish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale 2003. This expansive collection of proposals, plans and absurd schemes are carefully rendered in the style of Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbook drawings. ‚ÄòSanguis Gratia Artis‚Äô (2004) was a key work that represented a step away from figurative self-representation. Commissioned by the Henry Moore Foundation and Grizedale Arts for ‚ÄòRomantic Detachment‚Äô at MoMA PS1, New York ‚ÄòSanguis Gratia Artis‚Äô featured a black pudding self- portrait using Beagles & Ramsay‚Äôs blood as the key ingredient. This work toured to several venues in Portugal, and the UK. In 2006 a live cooking performance at the Royal Scottish Academy was banned by Edinburgh City Council. In 2019 this work was acquired for the National Galleries of Scotland collection with support from the Art Fund. One of their solo exhibitions, ‚ÄòGood Teeth' (Glasgow Sculpture Studios, 2008) featured a 4 x 3 metre priapic robot made from gold glitter and a 2.8m x 1.5m neon sign carrying the slogan Good Teeth. In 2005 they were curated in the international survey exhibition 'When Humour Becomes Painful' at the Migros Museum, Zurich. This exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue with essays by Simon Critchley, Heike Munder and Slavoj Zizek. The video work shown, titled 'New Meat', was acquired for the Gallery of Modern Art/Glasgow City Museums Collection in 2010. Beagles & Ramsay have also been included in a number of important survey exhibitions of Scottish Art that include 'Divided Selves. The Scottish self-portrait from the 17th century to the present day' (2006), 'Generation: 25 years of Contemporary Art In Scotland' (2014), which was organised by the National Galleries of Scotland, and 'The Scottish Endarkenment. Art and Unreason from 1945 to the Present' (2016). Recent solo exhibitions have often included combinations of video, print and sculptural elements, such as 'PINGPINGJERKSPASM' at the Pipe Factory (2017) and 'Circular Holding Pattern' Govan Project Space (2019). Most of Beagles & Ramsay's video works since 2013 have used a variety of animation techniques, including traditional stop motion and digital 3D modelling using video game software. Their video work is distributed internationally by Vtape. Exhibitions by Beagles & Ramsay have been reviewed in numerous journals and magazines including Artforum, Frieze and Artmonthly, in addition to features and reviews in national newspapers such as the Guardian, Observer, the Independent, Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Times. Beagles & Ramsay have also curated a number of group exhibitions and other projects. These have included 'Museum Magogo', Glasgow/Melbourne (1999) 'Dub'l InTrooder' at Transmission, Glasgow (2001), 'Rubble Stir'(2010), 'Triumph Of Zero' at Voidoid and 'Good ¬£uck', Gi Festival 2018. They also edit the journal 'Uncle Chop Chop', which has featured contributions from many artists and writers over the past decade including David Shrigley, Mark Fisher, Dan Perjovschi, Erica Eyres, Mick Peter, Clara Ursitti, Owen Piper.

Construction and commissioning LST-779 was laid down on 21 May 1944, by the Dravo Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 1 July 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Andrew Vavrek, and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 3 August 1944, with Lieutenant jg Joseph A. Hopkins, USNR, in command. Service history After a short period for final fitting out at the Naval Base at Algiers, LST-779 departed on 14 August 1944, for her two-week shakedown at St. Andrews Bay, Florida. The ship returned to New Orleans, via Gulfport, Mississippi, and Algiers, on 5 September, where she loaded her tank deck with heavy construction materials earmarked for forward areas. At New Orleans, she loaded five sections of Tank Landing Craft (LCT) on the main deck, made final checkups, met other logistical needs, and on 7 September, departed for the Pacific Fleet. After transiting the Panama Canal on 18 September 1944, the ship steamed to San Diego, California, visiting Acapulco, Mexico, en route. On 8 October, LST-779 departed San Diego, unescorted, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Territory of Hawaii, on 18 October. Having unloaded the materials she carried from New Orleans, she undertook a period of intensive training with units from the US Army and Marine Corps in Hawaiian waters. It was not until January 1945, that LST-779 embarked her combat load of ammunition, gasoline, equipment, and marines of the 2nd 155-millimeter Howitzer Battalion, USMC and eight amphibious trucks (DUKW) from the 473rd Amphibian Truck Company (US Army). On 22 January, she departed Hawaii, setting a course for the Marianas. =Invasion of Iwo Jima= Operating as part of LST Tractor Group Charlie, Task Unit (TU) 53.3.8, LST-779 conducted a rehearsal off Tinian on 13 February 1945, and conducted two days of logistics at Saipan, from whence she departed on 15 February. She arrived off Iwo Jima at dawn on 19 February (D-Day). The tank landing ship moved to the task unit‚Äôs position in area Charlie, from the beach. During that day and part of the next, she lay off the coast while the initial waves landed in smaller craft. Around 14:00, on 20 February, she moved in close to the beach and launched her eight DUKWs, and at 16:00, in response to a call by forces ashore for heavy artillery, she beached on Red Beach 1 at 16:34 and began unloading at 16:40. At 16:50 the ship‚Äôs guns began engaging targets on Mount Suribachi. Five minutes later, at 16:55, the 40-mm battery ceased firing. By 04:00, on 21 February, the marines had unloaded all the heavy artillery on board, together with part of the ammunition and gasoline. At 04:25 LST-779 was straddled by heavy enemy fire. A Japanese mortar round hit a gasoline-laden tracked landing vehicle (LVT) within of the ship's bow, and the resulting explosion produced fragments that pierced the hull. At 04:43 the tank landing ship began to withdraw from the beach. Afterward, Lt. Hopkins, LST-779s commanding officer, reported on board the amphibious command ship and conferred with Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill, Commander, Task Force 53 and his staff, who questioned him regarding beaching conditions, traction for vehicles on the beach, and the amount of cargo unloaded by his ship. Rear Admiral Hill also complimented LST-779s efforts as a job well done and ordered her not to re-beach until notified. From 08:00 until 18:00, the ship lay off Iwo Jima, near the line of departure taking LVTs and DUKWs aboard to unload powder and shells. During that time, at 15:00, she received orders to launch her pontoon barges. At 16:04, the first barge, no. 16, was launched and secured alongside, followed by the second, no. 14, which was secured forward of no. 16 at 17:06. At 19:23, sea swells and fresh wind caused no. 16 to puncture LST-779s hull just above the water line, allowing cresting waves to enter the hull. Conditions prevented the re-loading of the barges which were in danger of breaking loose as the manila lines and wire cables kept parting. On 22 February, at 01:03, both barges in fact broke loose and although the ship attempted to recover them, the efforts proved unsuccessful. Close to the line of departure at 09:33, the ship launched barge no. 13 and secured it to her starboard side. DUKWs began unloading ammunition off the bow ramp at 10:00. The barge put a small hole in the starboard side at 13:20. After being told to close in on Red Beach 1, the ship anchored off the beach awaiting orders. After shifting anchorage to off Green Beach, the anchor dragged and the ship remained underway the remainder of the evening maintaining her position off the beach. Flag raising on Mout Suribachi From top to bottom; USS LST-779, , , , , and beached at the foot of Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima, 25 February 1945. On 23 February 1945, LST-779 received order to beach on the left flank of Green Beach 1, at 08:30, and she did so at 08:42, and unloaded the remainder of her combat cargo. Throughout the day the beach party continued unloading the remainder of the 2nd Howitzer Battalion's ammunition. That same day units from the 2nd Battalion of the 28th Marines took the summit of Mount Suribachi, and erected an American flag tied onto a section of pipe found nearby. Lt. Col. Chandler W. Johnson, the battalion commander, deemed the flag too small to be visible to many of the marines fighting on the island. He told 2nd Lt. Albert T. Tuttle to go down to one of the ships on the beach and procure a large battle flag \\"large enough that the men at the other end of the island will see it. It will lift their spirits also.\\" Tuttle hastened on board LST-779, beached near the base of the volcano, and obtained a larger set of colors. Tuttle, in turn, entrusted the flag to Pfc. Rene A. Gagnon, Lt. Col. Johnson's runner, to carry to the top of Mount Suribachi. It was the raising of that second flag that was documented by Associated Press Photographer Joe Rosenthal and SSgt. William H. Genaust, USMC, in their iconic images. An air alert sounded at 19:21, and the ship opened fire on enemy planes overhead from 19:25 to 19:35. Enemy aircraft were again fired upon from 20:00 until 20:10. The ship secured from general quarters at 21:00. =Continuing resupply= Unloading continued on 24 February 1945, until the end of the second dog watch. At 20:30, as the ship retracted from the beach, an air alert caused all ships to make smoke, obscuring the anchorage area and rendering maneuvering hazardous. LST-779 anchored 400 yards off Red Beach 1 at 20:49, and then shifted her anchorage to a position off Red Beach 1 at 22:45. On 25 February, the ship proceeded on orders to the attack transport at 02:03, and moored on the latter's starboard side at 04:28. She then commenced onloading cargo until full at 11:11. She then proceeded toward Black Beach, where she beached at 11:36 and began offloading. Unloading completed at 21:15, and she retracted at 22:53. She then ran aground on an uncharted sandbar at 23:03. The ship continued maneuvering to come alongside Harry Lee from 23:50 until 02:45, on 26 February, as strong winds made it very difficult to do so. From 03:00 until 12:00, on 26 February, LST-779 continued unloading from Harry Lee. After clearing the attack transport, she beached on Black Beach at 13:32, and began unloading eight trucks, four trailers, and approximately 300 cases of ammunition. At 19:53 the cargo was unloaded and she retracted from the beach and maneuvered to moor alongside at 20:48. On 27 February 1945, LST-779 cleared Bladen at 21:05, with a cargo of 42 vehicles, 120 tons of medical supplies and ammunition, 20 medical officers, and 162 men of the Medical Battalion, V Amphibious Corps. She continued maneuvering with great difficulty among the transports and other amphibious ships and craft close to the beach. As another tank landing ship took her position on the beach, LST-779 ran aground on uncharted sandbar. After some additional maneuvering the ship finally beached and began unloading at 01:40, on 28 February. She continued unloading her medical cargo until 15:00. Upon orders she retracted from the beach at 15:33 with mattresses plugging the holes in her hull to proceed to a convoy rendezvous for departure from the waters around Iwo. At 17:15 she joined the convoy proceeding to Saipan for repairs. =Operations at Okinawa= On 6 April 1945, after completion of repairs, LST-779 cleared the floating drydock and moored alongside another tank landing ship in Tanapag Harbor, Saipan. At 18:35, she embarked elements of the 20th Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) with their heavy construction equipment and departed for Okinawa, on 12 April. She arrived there on 17 April. The ship landed at Kinmu Wan Bay, on the eastern side of Okinawa. All ships proceeded into the bay in single column and LST-779 anchored at 14:05. During the night the eight tank landing ships unloaded all their pontoon barges to create a \\"T-shaped\\" pier for unloading equipment. On 18 April, she got underway at 15:48, proceeding to within of Gushikawa, where she anchored. At 16:07, she secured from general quarters, and at 18:15 moored alongside and LST-779 supplied her with fuel, ammunition, and stores. She beached at 10:40, on 19 April 1945, and then in attempting to moor at 11:08, caused damage to the bow doors. She successfully moored at 11:30, and began unloading at 12:01. At 12:27, moored alongside, and by 20:45, all cargo and Seabees were ashore. The ship retracted from the beach and cleared LST-898 at 21:45, and anchored off the beach at 22:35. On 20 April, the ship got underway and while maneuvering between two tank landing ships, LST-779 grounded on an uncharted reef or rock. She made initial attempts to retract from this position that proved unsuccessful. Eventually, at 04:01, on 21 April, she ungrounded and shifted to an anchorage adjacent to the survey ship . Later, maneuvering at various courses and speeds, the ship left Kinmu Wan, at 15:51, to form in a convoy as TU 51.29.19. This convoy of eight LSTs departed in formation with two submarine chasers as escorts for Saipan, at 17:05. After an uneventful six-day voyage from Okinawa to Saipan, the ship anchored in the outer Tanapag Harbor, at 10:45, on 27 April. =Supplying advanced bases= During the next few months LST-779 turned from landing on invasion beachheads to the job of supplying advanced bases. She remained at Saipan, from 27 April 1945, until she got underway bound for Guam, on 24 May. Arriving the next day she moored in Apra Harbor, Guam, at 12:26 next to . She departed Guam, on 13 June, at 16:48, bound for Saipan, arriving on 14 June. She then got underway for Iwo Jima, on 16 June, with her tank deck loaded with aviation stores and four pontoon barges secured to her sides, and arrived at her destination on 19 June. Although Japanese planes managed to drop a few scattered bombs on the island, the ship emerged unharmed and continued to unload her cargo. As she attempted to retract from the beach, however, high winds and heavy seas caused by an approaching typhoon forced her to broach. With the assistance of the salvage vessel , the infantry landing craft , and three bulldozers, LST-779 managed to work herself free at high tide with only minor damage. She remained at Iwo Jima, until 28 June, when she got underway for Guam, arriving on 3 July. =Sinking of Indianapolis= At Guam, LST-779 loaded cargo and, with four powered pontoon barges manned by men of the 70th Naval Construction Battalion, departed at 15:30, on 27 July, bound for the Philippines, setting course to follow Convoy Route Peddie. While en route the ship‚Äôs log noted that \\"at 1312\\" on 29 July, \\"Held general quarters to conduct firing exercises.\\" Also traveling along that route around that time was the heavy cruiser . The tank landing ship arrived at Guiuan, Samar, Philippines, without incident on 1 August. Sadly,the same could not be said for Indianapolis. Rear Admiral Charles B. McVay III, the latter's commanding officer, noted passing an unknown LST on 29 July. \\"We passed an LST headed toward Leyte, as we were also, on Sunday,\\" McVay, later related in an oral history, \\"They were north of us and they were preparing to go further north to get out of our area to do some anti-aircraft shooting.\\" That encounter was within 12 hours of Indianapolis being torpedoed and sunk with heavy loss of life by the , (Commander Mochitsura Hashimoto), at 00:14, on 30 July. LST-779 was likely the last American ship to encounter Indianapolis before her loss. Following her anti-aircraft exercises, the tank landing ship's deck logs indicated that she maintained a course slightly north of Peddie. That track, therefore, placed the ship well out of possible visual range of sighting any Indianapolis survivors in the water as she made her voyage to Samar. =Occupation of Japan= On 3 August 1945, LST-779 moved to Calicoan Island, Guiuan, where she took on cargo and then departed for Manicani Island, Guiuan, where she arrived on 6 August. The next day, 7 August, she moved to Lausan Bay, and then on to Guiuan, on 8 August. She departed for Manila, on 9 August, arrived there on 12 August, and remained there through V-J Day. On 26 August, she got underway for San Pedro Bay, Leyte, and reached her destination three days later. On 3 September 1945, LST-779 was assigned to Tractor Group Baker (TU 54.6.2) to participate in lifting troops and equipment of the U.S. Sixth Army to Wakayama, Honshu, in accordance with the Fifth Fleet Eastern Occupation Group Plan. Getting underway from San Pedro Bay, at 17:50 on 4 September, the ships formed a three-column convoy of 25 LSTs and 15 LSMs for passage to San Fernando, Lingayen Gulf, Philippines, via Surigao Strait, Mindanao Sea, Sulu Sea, and the South China Sea. En route, she hit a submerged log on 7 September, that damaged her starboard screw. LST-779 anchored in Lingayen Gulf, on 8 September 1945, where an inspection showed that the ship could continue on without further damage. After tests on 10‚Äì11 September, the ship embarked units of the US Army 60th Signal Battalion, at Lingayen Gulf, on 12 September, completing that evolution the following day. Having anchored awaiting orders to get underway, the ship departed Lingayen Gulf, and formed convoy en route to Wakayama, Honshu, Japan, via the Balintang Channel. The convoy formed into two columns to negotiate the narrow swept channel through Kii Suido, on 24 September, and the next day, 25 September, at Wakayama, carried out the initial landings in force on southern Honshu. After unloading on 29 September, the ship received tentative orders to return to Lingayen Gulf, to lift more occupation forces to Japan. She got underway the next day, 1 October, as part of LST Flotilla 13 (Commander, TU 54.18.21). En route to Lingayen Gulf, the ship was detached from the convoy at 04:10, on 9 October 1945, in company with , , , and , to proceed to Subic Bay, for repairs. She anchored in berth 73 at 09:52. On 14 October, the ship entered the floating dry dock for repairs to the damaged screw and shaft. With repairs completed on 16 October, LST-779 undocked and proceeded to the loading beach where she began embarking the men and loading the equipment of the 35th Fighter Control Squadron, USAAF. On 18 October, she got underway as a constituent of LST Group 41 (TU 54.15.15) in company with LST-565, LST-134, LST-281, and , to rendezvous with , , and off Lingayen Gulf. On 25 October 1945, she anchored at Sasebo, Japan, and completed her unloading three days later. LST-779 sailed to Nagasaki, on 1 November, and began loading upon her arrival on 2 November. She then made a short shuttle run to Takasu, with U.S. Marine occupation forces arriving on 5 November. On 14 November, the tank landing ship departed bound for a return to Leyte Gulf, to participate in the closing of U.S. Army bases and activities in the Philippines, and assembling surplus war equipment. She arrived on 20 November. The ship then moved on to the Guiuan Roadstead, on 27 November, and remained there until 2 December, when she moved on to San Pedro Bay, arriving on 3 December. LST-779 then departed for Cebu, Philippines, on 4 December, arriving the following day. The ship remained there until she departed for Batangas, Philippines on 11 December, arriving the next day. Having remained at Batangas, until 23 December, LST-779 then moved on to Cebu, where she arrived on Christmas Day. She then returned to Batangas, departing on 28 December, and arriving on the last day of 1945. LST-779 remained at Batangas, until getting underway on 3 January 1946, for Cebu, where she arrived on 6 January. She then made a return voyage to Batangas, departing on 12 January, and arriving on 14 January. Departing Batangas, on 19 January, LST-779 set a course for San Jose, Mindoro, Philippines, and arrived there the same day, returning to Batangas, on 21 January. After a week's stay, she departed on 28 January, and arrived at Iloilo, Panay, Philippines, on 29 January.

On 27 February, the ship departed the Philippines, bound for Okinawa, with a load of aviation supplies, standing in to Naha Harbor, on 3 March. She moved on to Buckner Bay, on 9 March, and while at Okinawa, received orders to return to the Philippines, for decommissioning. LST-779 sailed on 6 April, and arrived at Subic Bay, on 11 April. Decommissioning LST-779 was decommissioned on 18 May 1946' and stricken from the Navy list on 19 July. On 5 December 1947, the ship was sold to Bosey, in the Philippines. On 2 May 1951, the ship was offered back to the Navy in a letter from T.Y. Fong. That proposal, however, was turned down by the Navy on 18 May. Honors and awards LST-779 earned two battle stars for her World War II service.

Maitland completed her undergraduate degree in medicine at the St Bartholomew‚Äôs Medical School in 1986. She specialises in paediatrics, global health and clinical trials.  Research and career  Maitland worked as a clinician scientist co-managing a project of field-based longitudinal epidemiology studies on the Pacific islands of Vanuatu, working with Professor Sir David Weatherall. The work investigated malaria parasite species interactions and host protection by alpha thalassaemia. Since 2000, Maitland has been based full-time in East Africa, leading a research group studying the impact of effective emergency care on childhood mortality. Maitland was the principal investigator on the FEAST trial. The trial demonstrated that fluid boluses resulted in increased mortality in African children with severe febrile illness and excess mortality was largely a result of cardio-vascular collapse. The paper reporting the FEAST trial won the 2012 BMJ Research Paper of the Year. Her group completed the multicentre TRACT trial which tested two transfusion and treatment strategies in nearly 4000 children in Africa that aimed to reduce deaths and illness those hospitalised with severe anaemia, providing randomised evidence for transfusion management. Other aspects of her research portfolio include clinical studies and trials in severe malaria, severe malnutrition and oxygen and respiratory support trial in children hospitalised with severe pneumonia.

The three videos, widely characterized as officially documenting UFOs, were the subject of extensive coverage in mainstream media in 2017, and later declassified by the Pentagon in 2020. Publicity surrounding the videos has prompted a number of explanations, including drones or unidentified terrestrial aircraft, anomalous or artefactual instrument readings, physical observational phenomena (e.g., parallax), human observational and interpretive error, and speculations of alien spacecraft. Background In 2004, F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter pilots and sensor instrumentation associated with the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group reported instrument detection of unknown aerial objects. According to Navy pilot David Fravor, a radar operator aboard the USS Princeton told him to investigate radar indications of a target at that had apparently moved rapidly down to the sea before stopping at . Fravor said the operator told him he had been tracking similar radar indications for the past two weeks. During 2014‚Äì2015, fighter pilots associated with the carrier strike group reported instrument detections of unknown aerial objects which the pilots were unable to identify. These detections, along with pilot observations, were later reported in the mainstream media. Some of the involved pilots subsequently gave interviews about their experiences. The resulting three videos, termed ‚ÄúGIMBAL.wmv,‚Äù ‚ÄúGOFAST.wmv,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFLIR.mp4,‚Äù purporting to show encounters by jets from Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt with unusually shaped, fast-moving aircraft, became subject to \\"fevered speculation by UFO investigators.\\" Stories published by the New York Times that featured the videos have been criticized by journalism professor Keith Kloor as \\"a curious narrative that appears to be driven by thinly-sourced and slanted reporting.\\" According to Kloor, \\"Cursory attention has been given to the most likely, prosaic explanations. Instead, the coverage has, for the most part, taken a quizzical, mysterious frame that plays off the catchy ‚ÄúUFO‚Äù tag in the headline.\\" The videos, featuring cockpit display data and infrared imagery, were initially provided to the press by Luis Elizondo, a former employee of the Department of Defense working with To the Stars on UFO-related matters. The videos were later declassified and publicly released in 2020 by the Pentagon. A Pentagon spokeswoman confirmed that the released videos were made by naval aviators and that they are \\"part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years.\\" The US Navy confirmed that, in response to inquiries, congressional hearings presented by aviators and senior naval intelligence officials have been provided to members of Congress. Potential explanations As of 2020, the aerial phenomena recorded from the Nimitz and Roosevelt events are characterized by the US Department of Defense as \\"unidentified\\". Widespread media attention to these events has motivated theories and speculations from private individuals and groups about the underlying explanation(s), including those focused upon pseudoscience topics such as ufology. Regarding the pseudoscientific explanations, writer Matthew Gault stated that these events \\"reflect the same pattern that's played out dozens of times before. Someone sees something strange in the sky...and the public jumps to an illogical conclusion.\\" Mundane, non-pseudoscientific explanations include instrument or software malfunction/anomaly/artifact, human observational illusion (e.g., parallax) or interpretive error, or common aircraft (e.g., a passenger airliner) or aerial device (e.g., weather balloon), with the science writer Mick West stating that the reported objects in these incidents are \\"most likely...a relatively slow- moving object like a bird or a balloon,\\" and that \\"the jet filming it is moving fast, so this creates an illusion of speed against the ocean.\\" West stated that the GIMBAL video can be explained as footage of a distant plane with the apparent rotation actually being the glare in the IR camera rotating. Following the congressional hearings and in order to encourage pilots to flag disturbances that \\"have been occurring regularly since 2014,\\" the US Navy announced it had updated the way pilots were to formally report unexplained aerial observations. Commenting on these updated guidelines, a spokesman for the deputy Chief of Naval Operations said, \\"The intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.\\" Regarding the new guidelines, the spokesman said that one possible explanation for the increase in reported intrusions could be the rise in availability of unmanned aerial systems such as quadrocopters. The acting chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Marco Rubio says that he fears the UFOs in the videos may be Chinese or Russian technology. Retired Admiral Gary Roughead, who commanded both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets before serving as Chief of Naval Operations from 2007 to 2011, said in 2020 that in his time, \\"most of the assessments were inconclusive\\" as to what these videos showed. In the context of a lecture on China's 21st century military strategy, Roughead commented that development of unmanned autonomous aircraft that had the capability to be used as submersible military assets was a priority of the US, as well as other nations such as China and Russia.

Although typically made with Fernet-Branca and Coca-Cola, several amaro brands have appeared in Argentina since its popularization, as well as ready-to-drink versions. The cocktail first became popular among the youth of the college town of C√≥rdoba, in the 1980s and‚Äîimpulsed by an advertising campaign led by Fratelli Branca‚Äîits consumption grew in popularity during the following decades to become widespread throughout the country, surpassed only by that of beer and wine. It is now considered a cultural icon of Argentina and is especially associated with its home province of C√≥rdoba, where the drink is most consumed. The popularity of fernet con coca is such that Argentina consumes more than 75% of all fernet produced globally. The drink can also be found in some of its bordering countries, such as Uruguay and Bolivia. In 2020, fernet con coca became the first Argentine drink to be recognized as an IBA official cocktail, listed under the name \\"fernandito\\" in the \\"new era drinks\\" category. History Fernet was introduced to Argentina by Italians during the great European immigration wave to the country of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a period in Argentine history characterized by vast economic growth and rapid social change. The popularity of fernet in Argentina is representative of the lasting influence Italian immigrants had in the broader consumer tastes and culture of the country. Over many years, fernet consumption expanded in an unprecedented way throughout the Argentine territory, although this process is still \\"confusing and poorly documented\\". In 1941, Fratelli Branca opened its first and only production plant outside Italy in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Parque Patricios, which indicates that already at that time the fernet market in Argentina was considerable. Another underground plant was opened in 1982 in Tortuguitas, Buenos Aires Province. Before the combination with cola became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s, fernet was traditionally consumed in the country as an ap√©ritif and digestif, and was either drunk as an after-dinner shot, mixed with soda water or as part of a carajillo de fernet, in which some dashes of the bitter are added to a cup of coffee. Caras y Caretas in 1920, showing a family having soda water and fernet, representing the bitter as a staple in homely life Although the exact origin of the cocktail is poorly-documented and \\"somewhat shrouded in mythmaking\\", it is generally agreed that it originated in C√≥rdoba Province, and is heavily associated with its capital of the same name, Argentina's second most populous city. Some sources say that the cocktail already existed in the 1950s, as a \\"gentler\\" variation of the common combination of fernet and soda water, while others affirm that it was invented in the 1970s by Oscar \\"el Negro\\" Becerra, a drummer and bartender from Cruz del Eje, a city in the province's northwest. Another version suggests the drink was invented in Argentina's northern provinces. Fernet con coca began to grow in popularity in C√≥rdoba city during the 1980s, in the period that followed Argentina's return to democracy. Although \\"theories swirl about who sparked fernet's explosion\\", most point to the city's large population of university students. By the end of the decade, Fratelli Branca's marketing director noticed the drink's growing popularity in C√≥rdoba and launched a series of national advertising campaigns actively encouraging the combination with Coca-Cola, at first in an \\"implicit\\" agreement with The Coca- Cola Company and, between 1994 and 1997, as an official co-branding campaign. Fratelli Branca head of marketing since 1992 Hern√°n Mutti told Fortune in 2016: \\"We had to convince Argentina that this was the way to drink fernet: to be shared between friends. It was being drunk behind closed doors; it wasn't a friendly product.\\" The company then \\"did everything to get people to try fernet and cola on any occasion\\", promoting the drink with samplings at bars and events and in popular seaside towns along the coastline of the Atlantic, targeting people under the age of 25. The tastings were accompanied by advertising connecting Fernet-Branca to distinctive national landscapes, like Patagonia's Perito Moreno glacier. The campaign is considered one of the most successful marketing strategies in the country's recent history, as it managed to \\"capture a still incipient consumption in a specific place in the country to popularize it and impose it in the daily life of Argentines.\\" In addition to the effective advertising campaign, the popularity of the drink has been linked to other coinciding phenomena: the diversification of the Argentine market for alcoholic beverages and the modernization of cuarteto, a style of popular music from C√≥rdoba that expanded to Buenos Aires during the 1980s and 1990s, spearheaded by singer Rodrigo's success. Furthermore, between 1990 and 2010 the habits of Argentines were transformed as a result of a tumultuous political and economic life, with BBC Mundo's Daniel Pardo writing: \\"First came the splurge, opulence, and cheap dollar of Carlos Menem's presidency, then a terrible economic crisis in 2001 that triggered poverty, and then three left-wing governments that, in the midst of an export boom, enriched (or subsidized) the poor.\\" Branca brand ambassador Nicola Olianas told the Spirits Business in 2017 that he \\"has obviously contemplated how to replicate the success in other markets, but wonders whether the conditions in Argentina were somehow unique, with the long-established distillery and the millions of emigr√© Italians.\\" By the year 2000, consumption had already consolidated in cities such as Tucum√°n, Mendoza and Buenos Aires, and continued to grow despite the economic crisis of 2001. On the contrary, since 2002 fernet's production and marketing underwent intense transformations, establishing itself as \\"one of the most striking phenomena in the entire region\\", making way for women and young people as new consumers and cementing its popularity at bars, parties, asados and gatherings. In Buenos Aires alone, the drink's sales grew by 115% between 2001 and 2008. By 2012, 40 million liters of fernet were produced per year, twice as much as in 2007. According to a 2011 governmental report, fernet consumption in Argentina grew 251% during the 2000s, far ahead of beer's 60%. Another study reported that during the period of N√©stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner's presidencies‚Äîbetween 2004 and 2015‚Äîfernet consumption increased 405%, noting that \\"the kirchnerist decade could also be called 'the fernet decade'.\\" Fernet production in Argentina has been falling consistently since 2015, as part of a widespread economic downturn that began during Mauricio Macri's presidency. Between 2015 and 2019, the Argentine production of fernet and bitters fell from 56.4 to 44.3 million annual liters. Preparation Fernet con coca is a simple, two- ingredient cocktail known for its gold-tinted foam and bittersweet taste. Fernet con coca is a long drink, usually served in a tall tumbler such as the highball. Simple in composition, the two-ingredient cocktail comprises just its eponymous ingredients and ice. The result is a black concoction with a \\"velvety\\", gold-tinted foam, and a complex and bittersweet taste that features competing and complementary flavors. The exact proportions of each ingredient are debated, and people prepare the cocktail according to personal taste. A popular measurement is three parts fernet and seven parts cola, although those who prefer a higher alcohol content might opt for a 1:1 ratio or more. An early Cordoban version of the drink called \\"90210\\"‚Äîa possible reference to the 1990s TV drama‚Äîcalls for nine tenths of fernet, two ice cubes and one tenth of cola. The International Bartenders Association recipe‚Äîfirst published in 2020‚Äîcalls for 50 millilitres Fernet-Branca poured into a double old fashioned glass with ice, filled up with cola. Fernet-Branca and Coca-Cola are by far the preferred brands and market leaders, although several other local bitters have emerged since the drink's popularization, which include \\"premium\\" and cheaper versions, as well as \\"artisan-made\\" fernets, and ready-to-drink versions of the cocktail. Over the years, fernet products in Argentina have been \\"lightened\\" in relation to the traditional amaros of Italy, as they are now intended for consumption with cola‚Äîreducing their bitterness, alcohol content and \\"syrupy texture\\". La Voz explained a typical preparation of fernet con coca: \\"It carries two or three ice cubes and a variable measure of fernet and cola. It is recommended to serve it with an inclination of 45 degrees and in a long glass, so that the soda does not lose gas. The foam should expand to overflow the glass and then contract and stay within the circumference of the glass. On the contrary, if it drips between the sides, the soda was served too quickly and the drink will lose its character, its perfect condition.\\" Some people dump an extra measure of fernet just as the foam is about to leak out of the glass, so that it lowers and does not spill, a practice known as \\"coronado\\" (meaning \\"crowned\\"). Walkers commonly make a \\"viajero\\" (meaning \\"traveller\\" in Spanish), using half-cut plastic bottles of Coca-Cola as containers for communal drinking and to carry the cocktail. Popularity Despite being a relatively modern phenomenon, fernet con coca has managed to cement itself culturally, and is now regarded as a national symbol and cultural icon of Argentina, as well as the country's \\"unofficial national drink\\". It is mostly consumed in Argentina, but the cocktail can also be found in some of its neighboring countries, such as Uruguay and Bolivia. Despite its popularity, many Argentines consider fernet con coca to be an acquired taste, and its flavor often repulses foreigners. Some relate the success of the cocktail in the country to a general fondness for the bitter taste in Argentine culture, exemplified by the widespread consumption of mate and non- alcoholic bitters like Terma. Fernet's popularity extends beyond differences in age, sex or social class, and currently is the third most popular alcoholic beverage in the country, behind wine and beer. The popularity of the cocktail has made Argentina the consumer of 75% of all fernet produced globally, as well as one of the world's highest Coca-Cola consumers, drinking about four times the global average. With its long history in the country, the Fernet- Branca brand has achieved a \\"cultlike\\" and \\"almost mythical\\" status among Argentines. It is by far the most popular fernet brand sold in Argentina, having 79% of the market share, followed by Vittone with 11%, Capri with 7% and 1882 (known as \\"milocho\\") with 3%. According to Branca, only 5% of fernet sold in Argentina is drunk on its own, and the rest is used for mixing, largely with cola. Fernet con coca has been used as a novelty flavoring in ice cream, and alfajores, a local confection. Some companies sell canned \\"fernet con coca foam\\" that can be used as a dessert topping or filling. Three- quarters of the amaros sales are concentrated in \\"the Interior\\" provinces, that is, the portion of the Argentine territory that is not part of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. Fernet consumption per capita increases between 15% and 18% in the Northwest, which includes the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Tucum√°n, Catamarca, La Rioja and Santiago del Estero, as the region has a greater historical tradition of herbal liqueur drinking. However, the epicenter of fernet con coca drinking in the country is its home province of C√≥rdoba, which represented almost 30% of national consumption‚Äîabout three million liters of fernet a year‚Äîin 2013. The drink is considered an \\"emblem\\" of the province, and a fundamental part of its distinct cultural identity and heritage. C√≥rdoba prides itself on setting its own cultural trends, and fernet con coca has become one of its biggest icons along with rally racing and cuarteto. The popularity of fernet among Cordobans has been linked to the local custom of consuming herbal medicines such as burro, boldo and peperina. Writing for The New York Times in 2015, Jonathan Gilbert felt that the preference for fernet in C√≥rdoba \\"demonstrates the extent to which [its inhabitants] revolt against the prevailing cultural and political trends in Buenos Aires, whose inhabitants are called porte√±os\\". In popular culture Several recording artists, especially from C√≥rdoba, have made reference to the cocktail in their works. In the 1990s, rock band Vilma Palma e Vampiros from Rosario released a song named after the cocktail, which featured the lyrics: \\"I do not want to end up in a cell without my fernet con coca\\". Popular cuarteto artist La Mona Jim√©nez has also dedicated a song to the drink, in which he sings \\"I want to live life, after this one there is no other, that's why I drink fernet con coca\\". Cordoban band Los Caligaris refer to the cocktail in their track \\"Asado y fernet\\". Fito P√°ez names the drink in his song \\"Las cosas que me hacen bien\\", off his 2020 album La conquista del espacio.

After specializing in abstract art, in the 1960s she created collages and silk screens, seeking to capture ephemeral reality. From the 1970s, together with her partner Manuel Zimbro, she developed shadow puppets for her Shadow Theatre, gaining acclaim throughout Europe and Brazil. In 1998, together with Francisco Tropa, she created an installation for Portugal's contribution to the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. Biography Born on 9 December 1930 in Funchal, Lourdes Castro studied at the Lisbon School of Fine Arts, graduating in 1956. Her first solo exhibition at the Clube Funchalense in 1955 presented her early works which were influenced by Fauvism. On marrying her fellow student (1935‚Äì2005), in 1957 she presented an exhibition with him at Lisbon's Galeria Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. They then spent some time together in Munich before moving to Paris in 1958, thanks to a grant Castro received from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. There the couple published the experimental art journal KWY (1958‚Äì1963), creating a movement which included the Bulgarian Christo Vladimirov Javacheff, the German Jan Voss, and Portuguese artists including , Jos√© Escada, Jo√£o Vieira and Gon√ßalo Duarte. Together they specialized in silk-screen printing. Inspired by √Årp√°d Szenes, Castro concentrated on abstract painting but in 1961 followed the Nouveaux R√©alistes, creating collages consisting of real objects such as printing press letters or bottle tops in silver-painted boxes. In 1962, she began working with shadows and silhouettes, frequently in portraits of her friends. In 1964, she extended this approach to include layers of screen-printed or transparent acrylics. From 1973, Castro worked with her lifelong partner Manuel Zimbro, creating shadow theatre shows which were widely presented in South America and Europe. In 1998, she worked with Francisco Tropa on an installation for the S√£o Paulo Biennale.

The forests cover there areas of the frontal moraine, and the Supra≈õl River flows along the tributary of Soko≈Çda. Supra≈õl is the seat of the Knyszy≈Ñska Forest Landscape Park. The area of the Forest is about 1050 km¬≤, but as a result of afforestation of former agricultural land, its area increases every year. This process is particularly visible in the eastern part of its areaAndrzej Go≈Çembiewski: Puszcza Knyszy≈Ñska. Obszar gospodarowania siedmiu nadle≈õnictw RDLP w Bia≈Çymstoku. Bia≈Çystok: Fundacja Ekonomist√≥w ≈örodowiska i Zasob√≥w Naturalnych, 2008, s. 31. .. The forest is dominated by pine, spruce, and birch, alder and oak. There are bison refuges in the Knyszy≈Ñska Forest (since 1974). In the Knyszy≈Ñska Forest in 1988, the Knyszyn Forest Landscape Park was created. Human settlement and development From the entire area of the Knyszy≈Ñska Forest, the oldest remains of human settlement come from 10,000 years ago, from the pre-boreal and boreal periods of the Holocene period. At that time, tundra-type vegetation with an admixture of birch and later encroaching pine predominated. Larger human groups appeared in these areas due to the reindeer herd migration. The Narew and Biebrza valleys were natural routes for their animals for their seasonal migrations. They were a valuable source of food and other materials for contemporary people (e.g. skins for sewing clothes, building huts). Along with the progressing global warming, there were changes in the vegetation (taiga forest appears) and in the fauna. In the Supra≈õl valley, archaeologists discovered places related to settlement from the end of the Boreal period, i.e. about 6000 years ago. It was a heavily forested area, attractive to man for hunting elk and deer as well as for fishing. From this period comes the tomb of a hunter from Konne, discovered just before World War II. He was an example of a burial, which is rare in the Polish territories, where the deceased was planted tied in a grave and sprinkled with red dye (ocher). This type of burial occurred in the Mesolithic, in the eastern regions of Europe. Due to global warming, agriculture and farming began to spread. Due to the low soil fertility, animal husbandry was more popular among the forest population. The first breeders in this area appeared around 4,000 years ago. At the same time, natural resources of the surrounding forests and rivers were intensively exploited. Various tools have been preserved from these times, i.e. stone axes (in Zapiecke and in Krzemienne), tools for working with skins (Zasady and Sura≈ºkowo) and smoothed flint ax (found in Pieszczaniki). In the Bronze Age, tribes living in the Knyszy≈Ñska Primeval Forest began to exploit flint deposits, whose resources were discovered around the village of Rybniki. The mine sculpture in the form of funnels over buried windows and heaps has been well preserved. This allowed to examine and isolate various ways of obtaining raw material by contemporary people. Flint mining was carried out by digging deep pits (so-called pit mines) or by cutting into a steep slope of a hill and extracting lumps of raw material from it. Its first treatment took place in so-called near-workshop workshops, while for further processing, the raw material traveled to the vicinity of the Krzemianka River, where mining camps were often established. The final process of finishing flint semi-finished products took place there. Surface waters Backwaters around Szudzia√≥w The surface waters of the Knyszy≈Ñska Forest are an important element of the forest landscape and are characterized by very high hydrographic conciseness, as nearly 95% of the Park area lies in the basin of Supra≈õl river. It is mainly a lattice network of rivers, very different riverbed falls (some of them with a fall of more than 3 ‚Ä∞ typical for foothills rivers). The main river of the Park - Supra≈õl is fed by rivers of varying length from 3 km (Ja≈Ç√≥wka near Supra≈õl) to over 30km (Soko≈Çda, Czarna). The original surface water network is supplemented by a system of artificial canals and drainage ditches, as well as several ponds and dam reservoirs. Important from the point of view of water resource management is the long-term dynamics of river flows, which is measured by the coefficient of variation. Among the forest rivers, Czarna and S≈Çoja have the least variable average monthly flows, and the largest Soko≈Çda and upper Supra≈õl in Zauki.Wody Parku Krajobrazowego Puszczy Knyszy≈Ñskiej, Andrzej Nowak, Wyd.

It is the only area in Central Europe close in many respects (structural, geobotanical or zoogeographic) to the southwestern taiga. The varied terrain and the associated significant microclimatic, hydrological and soil differences, occurring even in small areas, contribute to the formation of a large number of plant communities.

Multiple reliable sources have identified him as Sources D and E in the Steele dossier, who allegedly shared key information to a compatriot, who then shared it with Christopher Steele. These sources have also identified him as \\"Person 1\\" in the Inspector General's report. Millian has denied these reports.  Life in America  In 2001, Millian moved to the United States, and in May 2006, he formed the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta. In 2007, he was invited by Donald Trump to attend a horse racing event in Miami. He was subsequently contracted to market Trump Hollywood properties by a brokerage company hired by the Trump Organization and The Related Group. In March 2014, he told Fox News that his Russian-American Chamber of Commerce website was recently hacked.  Trump 2016 presidential campaign  Early 2016, Millian became an official registered member of the Republican Party. In March 2016, Millian reached out to Michael Cohen about joining Trump's campaign, highlighting his knowledge of Russian politics and business. In July 2016, he made a similar pitch to George Papadopoulos. Later, he offered to supply Papadopoulos with a \\"disruptive technology that might be instrumental in [his] political work for the campaign.\\" He attended Donald Trump's presidential inauguration, attending several black-tie events at the inauguration. He has boasted of his contacts with George Papadopoulos, aiding in promotional real estate contracts for Trump, including that he was the \\"exclusive broker\\" for Trump properties in Russia, and that Trump introduced him to Michael Cohen. He has also boasted of his contacts with the Russian government, has provided translation services to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and been photographed with Oleg Deripaska and Donald Trump. The Senate Intelligence Committee has written:  Identified as a source for several key Steele dossier allegations  Identity as sub-source = Millian is described in the Steele dossier as a \\"close associate of Trump\\", and multiple reliable sources have identified him as Sources D and E in the Steele dossier, who allegedly shared key information to a compatriot, who then shared it with Christopher Steele.

The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported that Millian was \\"both Source D and Source E\\". Millian has denied these reports. Politico has summed up identifying information, some from the Inspector General's report: The Inspector General's report mentions \\"Person 1\\" as a sub-source: Steele's Primary sub-source, identified as Russian analyst Igor Danchenko, told the FBI that he never met Millian, but only spoke on the telephone with someone whom he believed was Millian. BBC correspondent Paul Wood has described a different sequence of events, in which Steele told him that Danchenko told him he met with Millian in 2016 on three different occasions at restaurants in Washington DC, New York, and Charleston. Wood speculated that Danchenko's changing stories, and statements to the FBI that he \\"could not recall\\" things quoted in the dossier, might have been because he felt that \\"he had to be extremely careful with what he told the FBI\\" because he was \\"terrified of being arrested and deported\\", and that he was \\"trying to downplay his role in finding dirt on America's new president\\". The FBI's Supervisory Intel Analyst also believed the Primary sub-source [Danchenko] \\"may have been attempting to minimize his/her role in the [dossier's] election reporting following its release to the public\\".

The son of Wilfred and Evelyn de Soysa, he was born at Colombo in June 1917. He was educated in Colombo at Royal College, captaining the school in a five match tour of Australia, which was the first time a school team from Ceylon had toured abroad. He later studied in England at Oriel College at the University of Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University, making his debut against Yorkshire at Oxford in 1938. He made three further appearances in 1938 for Oxford, before making a final appearance in 1939 against the combined Minor Counties cricket team. While at Oxford, he toured Jamaica with a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities team, making two first-class appearances against Jamaica. For Oxford University, de Soysa scored 241 runs at an average of 26.77 and with a high score of 67. The influence of Frank Woolley on his batting was noted, particularly his late cuts and driving. After graduating from Oxford, he returned to Ceylon where he coached the Royal College XI. de Soysa made a final first-class appearance for All-Ceylon against India at Colombo. For many years he worked for the family tea, rubber and coconut exporting business. He became president of the Singhalese Sports Club in 1997, then a team with first-class status, but had to step down the following year due to ill health. de Soysa died at Colombo in January 2002. His elder brother was Harold de Soysa, the first Ceylonese Bishop of Colombo.

She became notable for promoting the use of smallpox vaccination at the beginning of the 19th century, particularly in the Porto area. Biography Maria Isabel Wittenhall (sometimes written as Witenhall) was born in Avintes, in the municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia in Portugal on 6 November 1749 to English emigrant parents who were involved in the wine trade. On 4 May 1767, at the age of 17, she married Pedro van Zeller (1746-1802), who came from a Dutch Catholic family and served as the Russian Consul in Porto. The couple had three sons. Van Zeller became notable for promoting the use of smallpox vaccination at the beginning of the 19th century, particularly in the Porto area. For many centuries the disease had been treated by inoculation, also known as variolation, which involved the deliberate introduction of material from smallpox pustules into the skin. This induced immunity to smallpox but generally also produced a mild form of the infection. The Royal Family of Portugal experienced first-hand the results of a failure to inoculate when Jos√©, Prince of Brazil died of smallpox at the age of 27 in 1788. Towards the end of the 18th century, the work of Edward Jenner and others showed that cowpox delivered by vaccination to humans could protect against smallpox. Smallpox vaccination was first introduced into Portugal in 1799. Van Zeller started vaccinating in 1805 on her family farm in Avintes and also at her home in Porto, having been introduced to vaccination by the surgeon Jos√© da Cunha. There was considerable suspicion of its use, both by the Church and the medical profession. At one time Van Zeller was arrested for being a curandeira (quack or witch doctor). She appealed to the Royal Academy of Sciences for support and the Academy both successfully defended her and presented her with a gold medal in 1808. A Vaccine Institute was established in the university city of Coimbra in 1804 although its work was suspended during the Peninsular War and it was only re-established in 1812. Isabel van Zeller was a benefactor of the Institute and regularly sent it a tally of the vaccinations she had carried out. According to its records, she administered 13,408 successful vaccinations between 1805 and 1819, or 18% of the total vaccinations given in Portugal in that period. The Institute awarded her a gold medal in 1813, although this was subject to some controversy because members thought that another woman, Angela Tamagnini, also deserved such a distinction. In the end it was decided to deny Tamagnini the award because she had failed to provide the necessary data.

He was renowned for his \\"impeccable technique\\", \\"innate musicality\\", and his \\"rich tone\\", with a \\"warm, sensuous quality that seldom loses its luster\\". In a career spanning 60 years, he performed internationally as a soloist and chamber musician. His edition of Bach's Suites for solo cello, drawn upon facsimiles of the manuscript of Anna Magdalena Bach and showing them opposite each page, is recognized as one of his greatest achievements, and was described as \\"the most important edition of the greatest music ever written for the instrument\\". Early life and education Edmund Kurtz was born to a musical family in Saint Petersburg on 29 December 1908. In 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution, his family moved to Germany. That same year, Kurtz, aged 9, began to learn the cello. When he was 13, he began studies with Julius Klengel. Klengel later wrote about his pupil: \\"In spite of his youth, Edmund Kurtz is already one of the most outstanding violoncellists of today ... rarely have I found a pupil who developed so rapidly\\". He also studied with Le√≥ Weiner in 1924-1925. Career In 1924, Kurtz debuted in Rome, and the following year made his debut in Berlin. Both performances were successful and led to solo appearances in the main European cities. In Paris, Pablo Casals recommended Kurtz to continue his studies with Diran Alexanian. From 1926 to 1927, Kurtz was the principal cellist of the Bremen Opera orchestra, and from 1932 to 1936 the principal cellist of the Prague German Opera orchestra under George Szell. He then moved to the United States, where he served as the principal cellist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He then also played in a piano trio formation, the Spivakovsky Trio, with violinist Tossy Spivakovsky and his brother Jascha as the pianist, touring internationally. In 1944, Kurtz relinquished his post in Chicago to focus on his solo career. His first American appearance as soloist was in Dvo≈ô√°k's Cello Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini in 1945. This performance was recorded live, and remains Toscanini's only recording of the concerto. Other recordings include the Cello Sonata of Sergei Rachmaninoff with William Kapell, which received praise by Tim Page of The Washington Post, and Prokofiev's Cello Sonata with Artur Balsam, which was the first recording of the work. Kurtz often played a Stradivari cello from 1724, named the \\"Hausmann\\", after Robert Hausmann, the cellist of Joseph Joachim's string quartet. He played several premieres of compositions dedicated to him, including Ernst Krenek's Suite for cello solo, Op. 84, Alberto Ginastera's Pampeana No 2, and Darius Milhaud's Elegie and Cello Concerto No. 2, which he performed with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Artur Rodzinski in November 1946. He was the soloist in the first American performance of Khatchaturian's Cello Concerto, with Serge Koussevitsky conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1948. In later years, Kurtz began prolifically producing new editions of cello repertoire. Widely considered the most important of these editions is that of Bach's six Suites for cello solo, which he based on facsimiles of the manuscripts by Anna Magdalena Bach; Bach's originals did not survive. The edition, which features her manuscripts opposite each printed page, has been considered Kurtz's \\"most important contribution to the development of the art of the cello\\". Mary Campbell wrote in her obituary for The Independent that it is \\"recognised as the most important edition of the greatest music ever written for the instrument\\". Family Kurtz's brother was the conductor Efrem Kurtz. His other siblings included Arved Kurtz, a former head of the New York College of Music, and Mary Kurtz Rosenwald, a former professional violinist and noted philanthropist who was one of the founders of the United Jewish Appeal. In 1936, Kurtz married Barbara Bellair; the couple had two sons. He died in London on 19 August 2004.

He advised on various military engineering projects and was an engineer of the army of the Spanish army under Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria at the siege of Landrecies in 1648.Michel Hennin , Georges Victor Antoine Gratet Duplessis, Inventaire de la collection d'estampes relatives √† l'histoire de France l√©gu√©e en 1863 ..., Henri Meny, Paris, 1877 Life Proclamation at Ghent of Charles II of Spain as Count of Flanders in 1666 Very little is known about the life of the artist. He was active from about 1643 to 1669. He seems to have originally been based in Brussels where he married Marie Granvelle on 9 January 1635.Jacques van Werden at the Belgian State Archives He is known to have provided designs for the Plantin Press during the years 1648 to 1658 when the Press was run by Balthasar II Moretus. He may at the time have been living in Antwerp as the Flemish missionary Fran√ßois de Rougemont writes about meeting van Werden and his wife in Antwerp, likely in the house of Balthasar II Moretus.No√´l Golvers, Fran√ßois de Rougemont, Missionary in Ch‚Äôang-Shu (Chiang- Nan): Study of the Account Book (1674-1676) and the Elogium, Leuven University Press, 1999, p. 12 While working for the Plantin Press, he was also fulfilling commissions for the Chifflet family, a family of scientists and writers originally from the County of Burgundy who had established themselves in Antwerp. He provided designs for various prints included in their works, which were then published by the Plantin Press. Some of his original drawings are kept in the Plantin Moretus Museum, which is located at the site of the Plantin Press.Frank van den Wijngaert, De late Moretussen en de boekillustratie in \\"De Gulden Passer\\". Jaargang 25. De Nederlandsche Boekhandel, Antwerpen 1947, p. 192 Clovis departing for war and followed by a standard with three toads from 'Lilium Francicum' According to some sources he had a military career as an archer and member of the guard of the French King but this seems unlikely as his work and activities show a strong connection and loyalty to the Spanish rulers of the Habsburg Netherlands. Various prints made after his drawings mention that the designer was 'I. van Werden Archer et garde de corps de S. M.e'. This is most likely a reference to van Werden being an archer and guard of 'his majesty' the Spanish King, a role that he may have been appointed to by the governor-general of the Habsburg Netherlands. He is also referred to as 'Archer et garde du corps de Philippe IV', which makes clear that he was in the employ of the Spanish king Philip IV and not the French kingSander Pierron, Histoire illustr√©e de la For√™t de Soignes, Volume I, Imp. scientifique Charles Bulens, Brussels, p. 22 He worked on various official commissions relating to defensive works in cities throughout the Habsburg Netherlands. On 9 July 1643 he was sent by the general camp master Andrea Cantelmo to inspect the border locations. On 5 March 1644, he and the engineers Brunetty and Crespu measured the works carried out at the citadel of Namur. On 25 May 1644 he sent a letter with his opinion on the defensive flooding works for Brussels proposed by Michael van Langren. He is quoted on 28 March 1648 in a report of the Finance Council which proposes to increase his wages to 300 pounds a year as he is one of the first engineers of the country for drawing plans and maps. Until 1646, he received 15 √©cus per month from the artillery fund. In 1646 he became an engineer with an annual pay of 550 pounds. On 24 January 24, 1656, he is sent to Ath with Hendrik Janssens to report on and plan the necessary fortiÔ¨Åcation works. In 1658 he is recorded criticizing the fortification works for Brussels proposed by van Langren. The following year he signs a map of the Sonian Forest, which was engraved and included in Antonius Sanderus' Regiae domus Belgicae, of which two handwritten copies are executed around 1750. Siege of Landrecies On 5 July 1660 he co- signed a critique of Michael van Langren's defensive works for Ostend, and approved a counterproposal by the engineers Jan Heymans-Coeck, Hendrik Janssens and Pieter Mercx. He also imitated the French engineer-geographer S√©bastien Pontault de Beaulieu and illustrated sieges and battles won by the King of Spain, but of a quality inferior to the maps of his French counterpart. The engraved map of the siege of Cambrai in 1649 that was engraved by Lucas Vorsterman the Younger is an example of his work in this area. In the same vein, he would have made a view of the Castle of Ittre engraved later by Jacobus Harrewijn. Van Weerden died before 20 August 1669. His son Jacob Frans had like his father a career as military engineer and map maker. Work Van Werden is known for his drawings and the prints that were made after his designs. His works are mostly topical views, maps and also city views. He also made drawings as precursors for prints in various publications. The drawings of van Werden were engraved by various engravers including Lucas Vorsterman the Younger, Wenceslaus Hollar, Cornelis Galle the Younger, Richard Collin and Gaspar Huybrechts. Genealogical tree of three Portuguese families, etching by Wenceslaus Hollar He made a few maps of military engagement which were etched by Wenceslaus Hollar. An example is the Siege of Landrecies dated 1648, which is an etching on four plates on four conjoined sheets of paper. It comprises a plan of the city of Landrecies, with the Bois de Mourinal in the upper right, while it is under siege by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria in 1647. Some of the Duke's troops are shown under a tree in the foreground, with carts and guns. The print also offers a schematic view of the various regiments and forces under several commanders and their positions around the city. In the left foreground the French army can be seen approaching to attack the Archduke's forces.Wenceslaus Hollar, Jacob van Werden, Siege of Landrecies at the British Museum He made the design for a composite print consisting of 12 prints depicting the Proclamation at Ghent of Charles II of Spain as Count of Flanders in 1666. It shows a bird's-eye view of the Vrijdagsmarkt (Friday Square) in Ghent with stage erected for the proclamation of the new sovereign the king of Spain as the count of Flanders. The king did not attend the event in person but was represented by Francisco de Moura Corte Real, 3rd Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo, the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. The composite print shows a large crowd in the foreground. A frame of 118 medallions showing the portraits and coats of arms of the dignitaries present at the event surrounds the scene of the Vrijdagsmarkt. Including the border, these medallions are 82 mm wide and 90 mm high, not including the shield of arms. In the frame surrounding each portrait the name of the person depicted is printed in cursive script.Ferdinand Fran√ßois Ernest Vander Haeghen, Inauguration de Charles II en Flandre: notice historique, E. De Busscher et fils, 1867 Lily from 'Lilium Francicum' A few of his drawings engraved by Lucas Vorsterman the Younger were included in the Chorographia Sacra Brabantiae (Latin for Sacred Choreography of Brabant) a work by Antoon Sanders which gives a historical- geographical description of the duchy of Brabant, with much attention to the religious buildings such as monasteries. The Flemish painter Ignatius van der Stock painted in 1661 a large map of the Sonian Forest. The map painted in oil paint is over 8 m¬≤ in size (280 cm high and 285 cm wide) and is kept in a well-preserved state in the Belgian State Archives. The map is quite detailed and offers historical information on the landscape and urbanisation in and round the Sonian Forest located near Brussels.The Charting of the Sonian Forest The map was based on an engraving made by Lucas Vorsterman II after a map by the hand of Jacob van Werden, which was included in the Chorographia Sacra Brabantiae. Van der Stock added in his map some further clarifications on churches and buildings.Ren√© Van Bastelaer, Ignace van der ou van den Stock, in: Biographie Nationale, Volume 24, p. 50-53, Brussels, 1868 He was under direct contract by the Chifflet family to provide designs for some of their publications. He worked on some botanical and archeological works of Jean- Jacques Chifflet including his Anastasis Childerici I, Francorum regis, sive Thesaurus sepulchralis Tornaci Nerviorum effossus et commentario illustratus, auctore Joanne Jacobo Chifletio (ex off. Plantiniana B. Moreti (Antverpiae), 1655). This book provides a description of the burial site of Childeric I, which had been discovered in Tournai in on 27 May 1653. The illustrations were engraved by Cornelis Galle the Younger after designs by van Werden.Jean- Jacques Chifflet, Childerici I, Francorum regis, sive Thesaurus sepulchralis Tornaci Nerviorum effossus et commentario illustratus, Antverpiae : ex off.

The Plantin Moretus Museum holds a total of 127 of these drawings. He also made the designs for the prints of various variations of lily and other illustrations for Jean-Jacques Chifflet's Lilium Francicum, veritate historica, botanica et heraldica illustratum (1658, Plantin Press), a book on the fleur-de-lys and its heraldic, emblematic, iconographical and historical aspects.Karen Lee Bowen, The illustration of books published by the Moretuses, Museum Plantin-Moretus, 1997, pp. 169-170 It includes a print made after a design by van Werden which shows that Frankish king Clovis I used toads rather than the fleur-de-lys as his royal insignia.

Once they wrapped the winter, the whole team took a few months off to regroup, and returned in July to film in the intense South Dakota summer. Director Charlie Buhler said in an interview, \\"We fought to make this movie because we felt that there was a very specific expectation about the types of stories women were able to tell. Jenna and I both love action and sci-fi, so we wanted to make a female protagonist that we women could really rally behind.\\" Jenna Lyng Adams, added, \\"Growing up in Minnesota, I've always been drawn to stories about remote communities and places. The rural Midwest is already isolated in ways, but a global emergency could push it even moreso. I wanted to make a story about a woman reinventing herself over and over again to survive.\\"  Release  The film premiered at the 2020 Cinequest Film Festival. It also screened at the 2020 Manchester International Film Festival. Its festival run soon came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film garnered attention due to its striking similarity to the pandemic.  Reception  Liz Whittemore of the Alliance of Female Film Journalists said the film \\"is about trauma, family dynamics, fear, betrayal, and power. It will pull you in from the very first moments and not let up until the credits.\\" Dark Sky Films' Nicola Goelzhaeuser said, \\"Before the Fire arrives as the world is caught in an existential crisis, but it is really a timeless achievement that reveals how far people will go to survive.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:2020 films Category:2020 independent films Category:2020s thriller drama films Category:American thriller drama films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in South Dakota Category:Films about viral outbreaks ","title":"Before the Fire"},{"id":"64109635","text":"IRAS 05280-6910 is a red supergiant star or OH/IR supergiant star located in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

It runs from Vestergade in the northwest to Lavendelstr√¶de-slutterigade in the southeast, linking Larsbj√∏rnsstr√¶de with Hestem√∏llestr√¶de. The buildings that line the southeast side of the street (even numbers) all date from the years after the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. Six of themMmdash&No.; 2 and No. 10-18;,dash&are; listed in the Listed buildings in Copenhagen Municipality#Danish registry of protected buildings and places. The other side of the street is dominated by the rear side of Copenhagen Court House (No. 13) and the Anton Rosen Jugendstil Metropol Building from 1908. Etymology The street name is also seen in a number of other towns in Denmark, Sweden and Germany. The origins of the name is unclear. Although some speculate that it was originally used by sailors as a name for a narrow, treacherous strait (that only a cat could pass through). This name was later changed to narrow alleys. The name may, however, more specifically, have referred to a narrow strait between the old coastline at L√∏ngangstr√¶de and a small isle approximately where the National Museum is now located. History Gedde's district map The southern part of Kattesundet is one of the oldest streets in Copenhagen. In the Middle Ages, Hestem√∏llestr√¶de, its southern extension, was also known under the name. Diderich Fyrens (Fuirens) Gang, a just three metres wide alleyway, connected the street (at No. 14-16) to Mikkel Bryggers Gade (at No, 7-9) to the southwest. It took its name after the merchant Henrich Fuiren. The street was completely destroyed by the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. When the city was rebuilt, Kattesundet was extended northwards to Vestergade across the new street Frederiksborggade. The street was again destroyed by the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. Diderich Fyrens (Fuirens) Gang was not rebuilt after the fire, and the new City Hall was some 20 years later built at the northeast side of the street. Most of the buildings at the corners of the more busy intersecting streets Frederiksborggade, Kompagnistr√¶de and Vestergade were replaced by modern commercial buildings in the 1900s.  Notable buildings and structures  Kattesundet 18 The Neoclassical corner building at No. 2, was built in 1797-98 by the master builders Frantz Philip Lange and Lauritz Thrane, It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959. The Neoclassical corner building at No. 18 was built by master builder Carl Christian Martens in 1802. It was listed in 1964. The two small houses at No. 10 (1795-1800), No. 12 (1797-1799), No. 14 (1799-1801) and No. 16 (1828) are also listed. The rear side of Copenhagen Court House The former City Hall, now Copenhagen Court House (No. 13), was designed by Christian Frederik Hansen. The building houses K√∏benhavns Byret. The Metropol Building (Kattesundet 3 / Vestergade 9 / Frederiksberggade 16), a former department store, was built in 1908 to a Jugendstil design by Anton Rosen. In 1924, it was converted into a theatre by Viggo Jacobsen and Albert Oppenheim. No, 9-11: The Revisionsbanken Building The corner building at Kattesundet 9-11 / Frederiksberggade 11 is the former headquarters of Revisionsbanken. The building was completed to a Renaissance Revival design by Carl Thonning and Alfred M√∏ller. Kattesundet 1 / Vestergade 13 was built for the tobacco company Br√∏drene Bruun in 1906-1907 and was also designed by Carl Thonning.

History In September 1896, gas workers in Berlin went on strike in opposition to having to work for 18 hours on Sundays. Bruno Poersch, leader of the local union of saddlers, supported the strike, and helped found a union to represent them. This was officially established on 4 October, under the name the Union of Gas, Wood, Coal, and Other Workers, and by the end of the year, it had launched a journal. Poersch aimed to develop the union into one representing municipal workers, and so in 1897, the coal and wood workers were transferred to the German Transport Workers' Union, and the union became the Association of Gas and Other Municipal Workers, recruiting water, sewage, lighting, market and slaughterhouse workers, as well as inspectors of gas works. Section were established for each industry, and in 1899, the union was accepted into the social democratic trade union movement. Under Poersch, the union took inspiration from the British trade union movement, and notably argued that workers could best protect their interests if they worked for a single employer, and that strikes should be avoided whenever possible. It also argued for wages linked to seniority and the number of children each employee had, and for the unions to be politically neutral. These positions were unpopular with the rest of the trade union movement, and led Poersch to resign in 1906. He was replaced by Albin Mohs, who proved more malleable, and accepted frequent demands for specialist public sector workers to be represented by industrial unions. Under Mohs, the union renamed itself as the \\"Union of Municipal and State Workers\\". It grew, and by 1910 had 39,262, an estimated 26% of all workers in the sector. In 1909, the union's conference voted to replaced Mohs with Richard Heckmann, by 26 votes to 25, but in view of the closeness of the vote, Heckmann refused the position, and Mohs continued. He had been general secretary of the International Secretariat of the Workers in Public Services since 1907, and from 1914 was paid for the role, allowing Heckmann to replace him as leader of the German union. Under Heckmann, the union focused on negotiating collective agreements. It persuaded several small, local unions to merge in, and it signed agreements with larger unions which had some public sector workers. It was a founding member of the General German Trade Union Confederation in 1919, by 1922 had about 300,000 members. By the start of 1930, union membership had fallen slightly, to 266,000 members. At the start of 1930, it union merged with the German Transport Workers' Union, the Union of Gardeners and Nursery Workers, and the Union of German Professional Firefighters, to form the General Union of Public Sector and Transport Workers.

It was constructed in the early 19th century, and was once part of a larger residence along Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton, a broad public square. The house occupies only , and once part of a larger residence. It is recognized for its role in the independence movement in Bahia and Brazil; the house served as a meeting point for independence figures in the early 19th century. A marble plaque to the left of the door commemorates the house's role in the Independence of Bahia. It was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1941. The House at No. 4 Rua Ana Nery is a private residence and may not be visited. History The House at Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton 23-A is noted for its role in the Independence of Bahia, and more broadly, the independence movement in Brazil. Cachoeira served as an ideal location for independence figures of the period: it was distant from Portuguese surveillance and troops in the state capital of Salvador, but secretly accessible via the Paragua√ßu River. Cachoeira was able to maintain relatively free meeting places and an independent press. The House at Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton 23-A is noted as one of the primary meeting places for intellectuals before and during the Independence of Bahia struggle between 1822 and 1823; the town eventually became the administrative seat of the Bahian provisional government. Location The House at Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton 23-A is located in a line of eight single-storey, single-family houses on Rua Durval Chagas along the west end of Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton. The plaza was once the church yard of the chapel of the Miseriacorida Hospital. The baroque-style church with an ornate fa√ßade remains at the north of the square. The main post office of Cachoeira is located at the opposite end of the square, and was built in an Art Deco style in 1923. Small, single-family homes line the east of the square. The Fountain at Pra√ßa Dr. M√≠lton (), which dates to the 19th century, served as a primary fountain for residents in the city. It is located between the row of houses at the east of the square. Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton is connected by Rua to the Pra√ßa da Aclama√ß√£o. The House at Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton 23-A lacked the prestige of the large sobrado town houses of the sugarcane plantation elites of the region built in the 17th and 18th center around the town hall of the city. Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton, however, was connected to the historic city center by Rua Ana Neri and was an attractive location for the houses of merchants in the 19th century. Structure The House at Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton 23-A occupies only , but was once part of a large residence. It is a narrow structure with the front rooms arranged along a hall; the rear rooms are arranged around a small veranda. The house has a low, simple tile gable roof. The rear of the structure opens to a lower, undeveloped area of vegetation. A single stairway from the veranda leads downt to this area. The house has a simple fa√ßade with a door at left, corresponding to the interior hall; and two windows at the right. The door and windows have straight lintels and frames from that date to the 20th century. A marble plaque to the left of the door was placed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and has the inscription: Protected status The House at Pra√ßa Dr. Aristides Milton 23-A was listed as a protected historic site by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1941 under inscription number 200.

N. Viranovsky was at the same time with me at the Academy. He was a good friend, and we all loved him, but he was extremely frivolous and did not differ in particularly firm morality. During the war, as chief of staff of the corps (with V. M. Dragomirov), he received the 4th degree George, and commanding the 12th infantry division, he received the 3rd degree in 1916. During the period of the revolution and the collapse of the army, commanding the corps and the [army], it turned out to be extremely unstable and, under pressure from the ‚Äúcommittee‚Äù, submitted to the commander in chief of the Southwestern Front General Denikin a note about the need to remove all management concerns from senior commanders, keeping them in their hands as \\"specialists\\", only combat and combat command. Denikin immediately ousted him and during the struggle with the Bolsheviks in southern Russia did not want to accept Viranovsky into the army. \\"Viranovsky went to the Far East to Kolchak, but he got there already during the collapse and was shot somewhere by the Bolsheviks.\\" From the memoirs of V.N. von Dreyer: ‚ÄúHe was a brilliant man in every way. Officer of the General Staff, well-educated, witty, very prominent, handsome, brave; he perfectly commanded a regiment in the war, for which he received two St. George's crosses and two generals' ranks. At the beginning of the revolution, Viranovsky was already in the position of chief of staff of the Romanian front, with General Shcherbachev. ... Lieutenant General Georgy Nikolaevich Viranovsky suffered from the fact that he could not indifferently see a single pretty woman. Because of one of them, Shcherbachev was forced, one fine day, to replace General Herois in his place ... The last time I saw Viranovsky was in Odessa a year later; like many, he was already an emigrant, running away from the Bolsheviks, but still the same prominent, elegant, who did not take his eyes off beautiful women. They say that he managed to get to Siberia, where he died.‚Äù Awards *December 6, 1899 - Order of St. Stanislav 3rd degree *December 6, 1903 - Order of St. Anne of the 3rd degree *October 31, 1905 - Order of St. Stanislav, 2nd degree *December 31, 1905 - Order of St. Stanislav of the 2nd degree with swords and a bow (approved on July 8 (21), 1907 for works incurred in the war with Japan) *February 12, 1908 - Order of St. Anne of the 2nd degree *1911 - Order of St. Vladimir, 4th degree *December 6, 1913 - Order of St. Vladimir, 3rd class *April 24, 1915 - Order of St. George, 4th class (for the battles of November 3‚Äì10 (23), 1914 near the village of Podbuzh) *1915 - Order of St. Stanislav 1st degree with swords *1916 - Order of St. Anne, 1st degree *August 4 (17), 1916 - Order of St. George, 3rd class (for difference during the offensive on May 28 (June 10) 1916 near the village of Black Stream) *1902 - silver medal for a trip to China in 1900-1901 *1906 - light bronze medal commemorating the war with Japan of 1904‚Äì1905.

Dunham was an American engineer and machinist. He was known for designing and manufacturing steam engines, most notably the Dunham Engine.  Biography  Dunham was born in New York during either the late 18th or early 19th century. Dunham's early life is unknown, as he first appears in the historical record in 1834. In 1837 Dunham opened a machine shop on North Moore Street in New York City, later partnereding with William Browning to found H.R Dunham and Co., an engineering firm specializing in the manufacture of steam engines. Dunham's firm produced 16 engines from 1836 to 1838, with Dunham's engines being advertised in advertisements and in an issue of the American Railroad Journal. Drawings of Dunham's engine appears in Paul Rapsey Hodge's 1840 book The Steam Engine. Dunham also manufactured parts for other companies. Dunham's engines were similar in design to early engines by Baldwin Locomotive Works. He was also granted a patent for an improved rail wheel. H.R. Dunham and Co. continued operating with both partners until Browning left the venture in 1847. Dunham likely continued in the business until 1856, the last year his products were listed in a New York directory. As of 1849, Dunham was part of the American Institute of the City of New York's committee on manufacturers. In 1851 his name appears on senatorial documents crediting for him for manufacturing boilers used on the navy steam ship Fulton - likely USS Fulton.

His trademark as a painter was rich, exciting colour which he combined with loosely figurative images of vertical stripes and forms or idiosyncratic calligraphy. He often used a small coloured ink drawing divided into squares as a template from which to develop his large canvases. In 1966, he began using details from still-wet drawings he had smudged ‚Äì a way of working he regarded as his invention.  Biography  Meredith was born in Fergus, Ontario, but while still a young child, his family moved to Brampton, Ontario. Like his older brother (artist William Ronald), he attended the Ontario College of Art (1950-1953), studying with Jock Macdonald, and became interested in abstract art. After he graduated, he worked for the local newspaper, (the Brampton Conservator), as a cartoonist. In 1958, while still making his home in Brampton, he held the first solo show of his work at Toronto's Gallery of Contemporary Art. His work at this time includes sombre canvases of the late 1950s and 1960 with dark colours, sometimes interspersed with red and purple, as well as loosely figurative images of vertical stripes and forms. Meredith held his second solo show in 1961 at Toronto's Isaacs Gallery. The exhibition was favorably reviewed in the Toronto Star and he joined the Isaacs Gallery in 1962. In 1963, he moved to Toronto and continued to paint and hold solo shows. In 1963, he showed at the Isaacs Gallery and in 1965, at the Blue Barn Gallery and then at the Isaacs Gallery again (1967, 1969). In these years, he developed brightly coloured dynamic canvases. Seeker, a triptych, in the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario, is possibly his most major work. He developed from a study of coloured inks on paper which is also in the gallery collection. Meredith painted it with his parents in mind, thinking of them as spiritual beings, and it took him four months to paint. There were more changes to come. Over a period of years, Meredith recalled the calligraphy of Oriental art, his symbolic imagery changed into abstract imagery, and he used colour to explore space, enriching his palette to include pinks, purples and greens, then staining his canvas in the manner of other artists of the period. In these years too, he was given major recognition for his work and included in many group shows, both in Canada and abroad. Moreover, in 1986, in his home town of Brampton, the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives held a 30-year survey of his work. By the end of the 1990s, the work of Meredith, often painted with Expressionist brio, offered the public a more dramatic vision of the artist, but in reinstating colour and using the palette knife in his work, Meredith reflected more overtly than ever before the rich allocations of pigment to canvas so characteristic of Ronald and especially apparent in Ronald‚Äôs late works with their thick layers of dripped and splashed paint. But Ronald was ill (he died in 1998) and Meredith may have felt that a tribute was in order. Meredith died of pneumonia on September 9, 2000, in Toronto.

He first gained international attention in 2011 when he tried to overturn the country's ban on same-sex relations. He currently serves as policy and legal advocacy manager at human rights group LEGABIBO (Lesbians, Gays & Bisexuals of Botswana). He is also on the regional board of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. Caine has been attacked by Steven Anderson for his sexual orientation and was involved in the 2019 High Court case which led to the decriminalisation of consensual same-sex relations.  Activism  Youngman joined LEGABIBO in 2005. He has been involved in strategic litigation efforts to improve the legal situation of LGBT people in Botswana. In 2009 he announced a lawsuit to challenge Botswana's ban of consensual same-sex relations, which was filed in 2011 but then withdrawn to collect additional information for a higher chance of success. When an evangelical group compared homosexuality to incest and the deputy speaker of the National Assembly called gay people \\"demonic and evil\\", Youngman criticized these statements as \\"disrespectful, hateful and ignorant\\". In a court case forcing the Botswana government to register LEGABIBO in 2014, he was among the litigants and described the government's refusal as a violation of their \\"rights to equality, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and association.\\" The government had refused to register the group for nine years. Through LEGABIBO, Youngman was involved in the Botswana High Court case that decriminalised consensual same-sex relations in 2019. The case was seen as a landmark ruling with relevance for other African countries. Youngman criticized the attorney general when the state appealed the court decision. In a live radio debate in 2016, U.S. pastor Steven Anderson verbally attacked Youngman for his sexual orientation and called on the Botswana government to kill homosexuals. After the broadcast, then-president Ian Khama ordered Anderson's deportation for hate speech. At an event with U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, Youngman called on the United States to stop American evangelical pastors in Africa from \\"pushing our governments to either enforce sodomy laws or toughen them up and have the death penalty as a law for the LGBTI (community).\\" Youngman believes that local LGBT activism must not be overshadowed by foreign donors. In his activism, he uses Setswana expressions for English terms like sexual orientation and works with representatives from across society, including religious leaders and traditional chiefs. He served on the board of Pan-Africa ILGA, the regional chapter of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, and as a peer reviewer for the Other Foundation. In 2016, he was featured on the BBC World News programme \\"Working Lives\\". he serves as policy and legal advocacy manager at LEGABIBO.  Personal life  Youngman realised he was gay in primary school. Many relatives learned about his sexual orientation when he announced his lawsuit in 2009. He has stated that he always felt supported by his Catholic family. He got married outside Botswana in 2019.

The main event was the eponymous Prison Fatal (Spanish for \\"Deadly Prison\\") Steel cage match where the last person remaining in the cage was forced to be shaved bald or have to unmask as per the match stipulation. 2009 was the first second time that IWRG used the match concept Prisi√≥n Fatal. first held in 2000. In the main event Avisman, Suicida, Bushi and Freelance were all chained to the cage by one hand and had to fight to get a key to unlock the chain and escape. Suicida was the last man in the ring as Avisman climbed over the cage and out, which forced Suicida to have all his hair shaved off afterward. If Bushi had lost he would have been forced to unmask. The show featured four additional matches. ProductionBackground= Starting as far back as at least 2000, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. In 2009 IWRG created a variation of the steel cage match under the moniker Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") approximately once a year since its inception. The Prison Fatal has the added twist that each competitor is chained by the wrist to the cage with a long steel chain and to escape they fight have to get a key to unlock their chain before they are able to escape. The added chain helps to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\") shows. The Prison Fatal shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines.

She was the first female president of the National Committee for Monegasque Traditions, and the president of the Union of Monegasque Women.  Life  Paulette Cherici-Porello was born on 27 August 1924. She was a direct descendant of one of about thirty original Ligurian families who founded the Principality of Monaco settling there in the thirteenth century. Cherici-Porello's parents spoke Monegasque fluently: her father was one of the Monegasque native speakers interviewed in the 1940s by Prof. Arveiller of Paris to create the first Monegasque-French dictionary. Not much is known about her early years. Cherici-Porello lived in Fontvieille. Since 1974, Cherici-Porello as a member the National Committee for Monegasque Traditions organized dialectology conferences with the participation of such renowned linguists as Raymond Arveiller, Charles Rostaing, Ren√© Jouveau, Louis Michel, Armand Lunel, Andr√© Compan, Emilio Azaretti, Giulia Petraco-Siccardi and RP Louis Frolla and Canon Georges Franzi.  Work  In 1986, Cherici- Porello published her first collection of poems and stories ‚ÄúM√©sccia‚Äù. Currently the book is out of print and unavailable in shops and libraries, but it's planned to be republished. The second book ‚ÄúAntebr√ºn‚Äù was published in 2012. Cherici-Porello was highly appreciated as a Monegasque writer and poet. Prince Albert II of Monaco spoke of her literary contribution as ‚Äúthe enrichment of our literary heritage, the safeguard of our language and at the same time the base of our identity and the roots of our future‚Äù. From 1984 to 2006, Cherici-Porello was a member of the jury of the Monegasque language competition. She was the first female president of the National Committee for Monegasque Traditions and president of the Union of Monegasque Women. In 2018, Cherici-Porello was a president of Academy of Dialectal Languages. In 2012, Cherici-Porello was invited as a Monegasque poet to represent Monaco at London's Cultural Olympiad, but she declined the invitation saying she didn't feel up to travel. At that time she was 86 years old and lived in an elderly person's home, therefore traveling by plane would be very difficult for her. Paulette Cherici-Porello died on 21 September 2018 at the age of 94.

Failutto, an Italian who worked in Brazil between 1917 and 1922, completed the work in 1920 on the occasion of the centenary of the Independence of Brazil. It depicts Maria Quit√©ria de Jesus (1792-1853), a combatant and folk hero in the campaign for the Independence of Bahia, a conflict part of the larger Brazilian independence movement. Quit√©ria served in the Brazilian War of Independence between 1822‚Äì23 dressed as a man. She was subsequently promoted to cadet and Lieutenant, and ultimately decorated with the Imperial order. She, along with Maria Felipa de Oliveira (died 1873) and Sister Joana Ang√©lica (1761-1822) of the Convent of Lapa in Salvador, are known as the three Bahian women resistance fighters in the War of Independence against the Portuguese. Description The painting is in oil on canvas. It measures high and wide. Quit√©ria is depicted in the painting in military clothing holding a musket. The uniform is typical of the Batalh√£o dos Periquitos, which got its nickname due to the yellow color on the cuffs and collar of their blue uniform. The background is an idealized landscape of the Bahian Rec√¥ncavo, the interior of Bahia immediately near its state capital of Salvador. The Bahian Rec√¥ncavo was the stage fighting in which Quit√©ria participated. The Paragua√ßu River is depicted flowing towards the horizon; it connects the interior city of Cachoeira, the scene of the independence movement, to the Bay of All Saints at Salvador. Maria Quit√©ria wears the insignia of Knight of the Imperial Order of Cruzeiro on her left breast, a distinction offered by Dom Pedro I to prominent figures in the fight for the Independence of Brazil. The insignia of the Imperial Order is formed by a white star with five forked and ma√ßanetada points; the portrait incorrectly depicts it as a four-pointed star. Purchase and display The work was commissioned by the Ipiranga Museum in S√£o Paulo to place in its Hall of Honor, where it remains; Failutti also painted portraits of Sister Joana Ang√©lica and Princess Leopoldina of Brazil (1847-1871) for the museum.

It was designed to demonstrate the advantages of steam turbines espoused by Baldwin Chief Engineer Ralph P. Johnson. It was the longest steam locomotive that was ever built. The unit looked similar to the C&O; turbines but differed mechanically; it was a C+C-C+C with a Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boiler with automatic controls. The boiler controls were sometimes problematic, and (as with the C&O; turbines) coal dust and water got into the electric traction motors.

He first enlisted with the South African Light Horse in the Second Boer War where he was wounded on three occasions and lost the sight in his left eye. He then went on to join The Royal Canadian Dragoons where he travelled to Argentina and Mexico. After this excursion, he became a cameraman for Path√©, filming various battles from 1912 to 1914 including the Balkan War and the fighting in Belgium during World War I. Shortly after Tiger went on as a journalist to report on the Rif War rebellion against the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. He then went on to catch pythons and alligators in Mexico for zoos and returned to England to start a circus act. During World War II he acted as a firefighter. His biography, written by Godfrey Lias OBE, was published after an appearance on the TV programme This is Your Life, where he notably failed to recognise some of his grown-up offspring (\\"You're not one of mine, are you? Which one are you?\\"). Early years Born 23 September 1882 in Highgate, north London, England, the only son of John Thomas Sarll BA, Sarll grew up in London with his parents and his sister Rosa. Sarll was the only survivor of two twins; his sibling being a premature birth with Sarll still in the womb. Tiger Sarll was known for his height, being claimed by his sister Rosa, to be 3 ft long at birth and reaching the height of by the age of 12 and growing up to be 6 ft 4 in (193 centimetres). Sarll's family moved from Highgate to 64 Gower Street in 1890. Sarll was christened Thomas Henry William Bang-fee Sarll at the age of 12; Bang-fee (translated as 'eagle' from Mandarin Chinese) because of the Chinese minister to London, a family friend of the Sarlls. Tiger from a young age was vegetarian and showed a love of animals that stayed with him his whole life; at 77 he snatched a rifle away from two young men who were shooting swans and broke the gun over his knee. Sarll was also adept at handling animals; in his lifetime he would have a wide variety of pets including snakes and crocodiles, he was also a skilled jockey, at the age of 8 onward Sarll rescued runaway carriage horses on his street. Sarll was adept at handling firearms as well. Sarll claims that by the age of 12, he could shoot the rim of a penny at 15 paces and shoot the ash off a cigar (held in his father's mouth) at 20 paces. Sarll attended Highfield School, Clifton. After he ran away from school, walking to his home 25 miles away, his parents took him out of school. After meeting Florence Nightingale who remarked \\"You are a nice upright boy. You ought to be a soldier\\", Sarll, aged 17, boarded a ship on 11 November 1899 to fight in the Second Boer War. Boer War Sarll's journey down to South Africa was where he met members of his soon to be new regiment, including Joe Lyons who had been a scout with Buffalo Bill and claimed to be an escort for Pony Post during the American Indian Wars. Sarll arrived in South Africa and joined the South African Light Horse, a cavalry regiment with one of the officers being Winston Churchill and under the command of the General Sir Redvers Buller. Sarll earned his nickname 'Tiger' after members of his regiment remarked that he made a cross between a snarl and a growl before entering battle. He also became known for his motto 'Live dangerously. It's cowards that get killed'. It was around this time that Sarll was injured on 3 occasions. During the Battle of Colenso, a shell blew up at Sarll's feet, filling his neck with shrapnel and costing him the use of his left eye. He went straight back into battle after the wounds had been attended to, only to have his feet crushed by an out of control cannon. Sarll could still ride after this accident so he didn't report as sick and carried on the fight until he was hit by a bullet in the groin. The British doctors, after fixing his feet that had been broken for days, sent him home. After returning home Sarll, once at full strength, went immediately back to the war again joining Sir G. F. Gorringe's flying column as a scout. During the Battle of Zaman Komst Sarll is credited with single-handedly holding a valley from advancing Boers, incapacitating two in his defence. Sarll earned a commission and was gazetted a Lieutenant on 28 October 1901 reporting to the Border Scouts. The Scouts were known as 'The Bastards'. During one occasion with 'The Bastards', Sarll was tracking the Boers only to find that he was being tracked. In order to throw them off his trail, he rode randomly in the South African bush, getting lost in the process. Sarll only survived being lost for 8 days by finding a farm with occupants willing to care for him. Sarll returned to England soon after the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902. On leaving the army, he was gazetted as captain. From then on Sarll's temporary ranks included lieutenant, sub-lieutenant, trooper and provost marshal therefore also making him General Staff Officer. Sarll received two campaign medals awarded to participants in the war: the Queen's South Africa Medal, with clasps \\"Tugela Heights\\", \\"The Relief of Ladysmith\\" and \\"Cape Colony\\", and the King's South Africa Medal with the two clasps \\"South Africa, 1901\\" and \\"South Africa, 1902\\". Travels Sarll returned to Africa to hunt big game, though very rarely killing any animals. On one occasion, he lost a part of his arm to a lion he was trying to release from a trap. During this time, Sarll travelled all over Africa, most notably Kenya (referred to as British East Africa), Nairobi, Belgian Congo, Southern Botswana. Sarll, having had enough of big game hunting, went on to get a job as a ship-hand on a boat going to Canada. Arriving in Ottawa, Sarll took multiple jobs working at different farms. He later joined the Canadian Forestry Concern in Northern Ontario, whilst also looking for the Klondike gold of Dawson City. After buying a bark canoe from a local Indian, Sarll and some companions travelled nearly 1000 miles down the Yukon river in order to attempt to sign up for the Russo-Japanese War. During this journey, he saved the life of Paul J. Selles. After failing to enlist with the Japanese, Sarll returned as a farmhand to Ottawa before joining The Royal Canadian Dragoons. During his time with the regiment, Sarll nearly killed a comrade with his mess fork. This same comrade left the regiment after stealing Sarll's medals from the Boer War. These were later returned to him on 16 January 1939. Sarll soon made his way back to England as a foreman aboard a boat that was transporting cattle. Acting Sarll on his return to London joined Blakemore's Theatrical Agency and Denton's. He played multiple roles in various venues around London and the rest of England. War correspondent Sarll became a war correspondent after volunteering to go to report on Morocco for Colonel Tamplin. Landing in Tangier, Sarll worked for The Morning Post who assisted him in getting to Casablanca by way of a French boat. To reach less travelled destinations, Sarll joined the French Foreign Legion. It was in Casablanca where Sarll met and worked with David McLellan, a photographer for the Daily Mirror. Sarll covered stories and fought with the French from inside the town while it was being set upon by the Moors. Disapproving of the French laying train tracks through Muslim graveyards, Sarll returned to Tangier in order to solve the mystery of Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni (Raisuli) and his hostage Harry Aubrey de Vere Maclean. It was arranged for him to meet Raisuli, on the condition that Sarll played chess and brought some Western gifts with him. Sarll was led to a cave where he met Harry \\"Caid\\" Maclean, the man Raisuli was holding ransom. Sarll then went on to play chess against Raisuli and returning unsuccessful with no clear explanation to Tangier. Sarll, after WW1, returned to Tangier to report for The Daily News about Abd el-Krim, who was raising rebels to push out the Spanish. He was granted an audience and stayed with Abd el-Krim and his rebel fighters in the mountains due to his sympathies with the Moroccans after Casablanca. He helped the rebel group install a French 75 mm field gun and was a tactical adviser to Abd el-Krim. Marriage Returning home from Morocco, Sarll tried to meet up with his childhood Beu 'Kissy' Smith. After Sarll arrived at her house, Kissy refused to come down and so Sarll met her sister Sybil. Sarll married Sybil soon after Sybil's father's death, much to the disapproval of her family. South America With Sybil now pregnant, Sarll made his way to South America to set up a life for them. During this journey, 1000 miles from land, the log-line got caught in the propeller and Sarll had to dive under a ship to cut it free. Sarll arrived in Buenos Aires on 6 May 1910. Taking a job overseeing the construction of a bridge at Carhu√©, Sarll brought Sybil out to live with him in a house made out of train carriages on tracks. During this time they suffered attempted burglaries, swarms of locusts and a meteorite falling very close to their railway home. They stayed at Carhu√© until their son fell ill. To get to a doctor, they had to travel across the perilous and unfinished bridge. Once his son had recovered, Sarll returned to the men that he had been given charge over. They rushed him, forcing him to retaliate and kill one of them with a hatchet. Sybil, pregnant with their second child, and their son boarded a ship to England, while Sarll took another job working as a tally clerk for a railway company. Shortly after, Sarll went to fight in the Mexican Revolution in 1911, working for Francisco Madero as a tactical adviser to a force of 15,000, operating in Chihuahua. Sarll assisted the rebels with the siege of Guadalajara, where Sarll received the keys to the town from British consul Grenville Holmes. Film career A picture of Capt Tiger Sarll in the Balkan War featured in the Bioscope Sarll, after returning from Mexico, found a job as a cameraman for Warwick Film Company. He managed to film (unbeknownst to him) Emily Davison throwing herself under the King's horse in 1913. Sarll persuaded his employers, Path√© Gazette, to send him to Istanbul to film the First Balkan War. Sarll teamed up with Sir Hubert Wilkins to capture pictures of the Battle of Lule Burgas. Narrowly avoiding execution at the hands of the Bulgars, Sarll had to bribe his captors with ¬£400 in gold to let him go. Sarll claimed he had to cut up his films into small pieces to post them in order to avoid the Turkish censors. Sarll returned to England in 1913. World War I Before the start of World War I, Sarll was hired by Transatlantic and Universal Film Company to film in Belgium. He arrived in Brussels on 31 July 1914. Sarll was suspected of being a German spy and was arrested by the local authorities, only to be let free by Paul J. Selles, a man he saved in Canada. By the command of the Mayor of Brussels, Adolphe Max, Sarll and Selles engaged the German Uhlan cavalry. After this spat, Sarll took the camera to London and returned to fight at the front in Europe at the Forts at Namur. Sarll and Selles were captured by the Germans. The Germans tied them up and drank looted liquor. The Germans fell into a stupor, allowing Sarll and his companion to escape. However, Selles, against the wishes of Sarll, returned to the place they were held to fetch Sarll's telescope and got captured again. Sarll had to escape Belgium. He was assisted by locals to the sea where he stole a rowing boat under fire and rowed back to England across the Channel. On his return, Sarll visited Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener (who was also godfather to one of his sons) to deliver news from Belgium. Sarll was sent to a Sportsmen's Battalion. Whilst in this battalion, MI5 approached him as they had caught a suspected spy; it was Paul J. Selles, who had survived German capture. Sarll left the army and joined the Navy, due to his knowledge of Turkey. This was short lived however as he was not allowed to go with his division to the Dardanelles. He was offered a position in the Army as Assistant Provost Marshal where he was stationed at Weymouth as General Staff Officer. He lived with his family in five caravan train cars in Dorset. With the war over Sarll returned to the Thames Valley. Sarll bought Morley House, in large part, due to a gift of ¬£500 made to him by Colonel White. Post-war years Sarll made a fortune trading goods from Morocco over a period of three years. He sold through Harrods at one point and his success was due to his relationship with Abd el-Krim. After the Rif War Sarll's trade in Moroccan goods failed. It was at this time that his wife Sybil left him. Zoos and private collectors of animals hired Sarll to go abroad and capture large reptiles with his team. He was known to catch alligators in Mexico with only his hands and a lasso. In 1927, Sarll visited Guadalupe Island to see the very rare elephant seals. He was \\"worried that these huge, harmless, rather helpless amphibians would soon be extinct\\". It was during this excursion that he also visited Clarion Island. While the crew were on the island, Sarll saw and shot a giant squid that had come alongside the ship, perhaps mistaking the ship for a whale. After his return, Sarll headed into the Mexican jungle with the intention of python- snaring. He brought in up to 17 pythons a day on this expedition. Circus Act Sarll travelled via New York on his way back from Mexico. There he saw a man wrestling an alligator in a pool and was inspired to set up a reptile wrestling act of his own. He called himself Rais Sarll and in his act he wrestled and hypnotised alligators and pythons. He was well received in England though he did have some difficulties with his acts. On one occasion a python that he had wrapped around his neck started to constrict and he required the help of a policeman in the audience to get it off. On another occasion, a python swallowed one of his arms up to the shoulder; he badly scarred his arm pulling the python off. Thieves broke into Sarll's big top and let six alligators go by accident. Sarll found five but worried about the sixth missing animal. Five years later a 'crocodile' was hauled out of the Thames; Sarll suspected it was one of his. He also used to go shopping at Bentalls with a lion, which nearly led to him being banned by the store chain. Among other acts, he trained rats to do tricks. He also trained a gorilla to smoke. He said: \\"young gorillas are more lovable and more intelligent than chimpanzees, but are more dangerous as they grow older\\". When World War II broke out in 1939, food was rationed and Sarll was no longer able to feed any of his animals and so was forced to put them down himself. World War II After being turned down by the War Office a second time, Sarll found work as a firefighter with the Thames River Police. During as one of the Little Ships of Dunkirk, Sarll rowed a canoe over the English Channel, rescuing only one person whom he dropped off with one of the larger ships. He worked during The Blitz, saving people from incendiary bombs. He spent most of his time collecting munitions from the beach and dropping them off at a nearby destroyer. He got badly injured when a German soldier stabbed him in the arm with a bayonet. The officer in charge saw that Sarll was a civilian and let him go. Sarll joined the Royal Air Force in 1940 as a pilot officer, going on to become a flight lieutenant. By 1940, four of Sarll's sons and three of his daughters were in the Royal Air Force and two of his sons were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. One of his sons was a wing commander. Last years After the war, Sarll worked as a security officer for Aron's, an engineering firm in Kilburn. Later, at the age of 78 he worked as security at Bradwell nuclear power station close to Bradwell-on-Sea. He died at the age of 94 on 8 July 1977.

She was the third daughter of Sir Gerald du Maurier and Muriel Beaumont, and sister of writers Daphne and Angela du Maurier. Life The youngest of the three daughters of actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and actress Muriel Beaumont, she was born in London. Her grandfather was the author and Punch cartoonist George du Maurier. From an early age, she showed talent in drawing and painting and at the age of sixteen she attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts (now Central School of Art and Design) in Southampton Row, London, where she was taught by Bernard Meninsky. She later studied at St John's Wood Art School under P.F. Millard‚Äôs tuition. After her father‚Äôs death in 1934, du Maurier, together with her mother and her elder sister Angela, moved from Cannon Hall, the family home in Hampstead, to a smaller house nearby. The three of them also spent a lot of time at Ferryside, their home in Bodinnick, Cornwall, where they lived permanently after 1939. During the World War II, she ran a market garden. In 1945, during a visit to St Ives, she discovered its painters‚Äô colony, which revived her calling as an artist. In 1946, she left Ferryside for a studio in St Ives and held her first exhibition at the town's Society of Artists‚Äô autumn show. At that time, she met the artist Dod Procter and they began a close relationship. In 1949, du Maurier and Dod Procter were invited to join the Penwith Society of Arts which was started by Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson, who wanted to break away from the traditionalist St Ives Society of Arts. It was also when she met the poet No√´l Welch, who would become her life-long companion and partner. In 1953, Welch and du Maurier moved together to Manaton, a village in Dartmoor, Devon where they remained for the rest of their lives. Du Maurier painted mostly still lives, flowers, landscapes and some portraits. She continued to paint all her life and exhibited her work in galleries in London and in Cornwall, with the St Ives Society of Arts as well as the Newlyn Artists. Du Maurier died at her home in Dartmoor on 12 January 1997, aged 85. References Dunn, Jane. Daphne du Maurier and Her Sisters.

Bancor invented the world‚Äôs first blockchain-based automated liquidity pool, or automated market maker (AMM) called a Smart Token, a digital currency with an embedded converter (smart contract) that allows it to be issued or exchanged automatically for any token in its network. Bancor Network consists of all the different tokens utilizing the Bancor Protocol and connected through BNT, the Bancor Network Token, which serves as the hub token for the network through which any token can be converted into any other token. History The Bancor Protocol Whitepaper was first introduced on February 13, 2017, by founders Galia Benartzi, Guy Benartzi, Eyal Hertzog, and Yudi Levi. Bancor‚Äôs network is registered in Switzerland. The company takes its name from John Maynard Keynes‚Äô currency conception called the ‚ÄúInternational Clearing Union (ICU)‚Äù which proposed a supra-national currency referred to as ‚ÄúBancor‚Äù, an idea to redevelop the system of international trade in the 1940s. Bancor began with the creation of ‚ÄúSmart Tokens‚Äù, also called automated liquidity pools, decentralized liquidity pools, or bonding curves, which can hold one or more tokens or digital assets in reserve directly via their blockchain-based smart contract. Bancor raised 396,712 Ether (worth approximately $153 million at that time) on June 12, 2017, by selling its own digital token during its ‚ÄúICO‚Äù (Initial Coin Offering) or ‚ÄúTGE‚Äù (Token Generation Event) within the span of three hours. BNT is an ERC-20 token which runs on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning the token cannot be mined. However, it can be exchanged with other ERC-20 tokens and other tokens on other blockchains, via traditional secondary markets, other decentralized exchanges, or automatically via BancorX, Bancor‚Äôs own cross-blockchain liquidity network. Tim Draper was an early contributor to the project. On April 3, 2018, Bancor launched a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that converts between tokens in the Bancor Network instantly. In June 2018, Bancor launched a pilot project in Kenya to enable blockchain-based community currencies. The digital community currencies worked on an open- source system called the POA Network (a sidechain of Ethereum) that Bancor used to facilitate low transaction costs in instances of community currencies. The transactions that take place on POA are verified by a group of licensed notary publics in the U.S. who earn a fixed commission for maintaining the network. Each of the community-currency trades are recorded on their own subnetwork, then grouped together and submitted to the main POA Network to reduce transaction fees. In August 2019, Bancor added a community-staking mechanism allowing users on both its Ethereum and EOS blockchains to add liquidity to any Bancor liquidity pool and receive a portion of trading fees pro-rata. From its inception through 2019, the Bancor Network has processed more than $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency trades. Hack and criticisms On July 9, 2018, a cryptocurrency wallet on Bancor‚Äôs network was compromised, which led to the theft of $12.5 million worth of Ethereum and $1 million worth of Pundi X. Hackers stole $23.5 million originally, however, $10 million was recovered and no customer wallets were breached. Bancor was able to prevent $10 million of its own BNT crypto tokens from being compromised by freezing the funds, which raised questions from critics about Bancor‚Äôs decentralization. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee claimed that Bancor would not have the ability to freeze customer funds if it were truly decentralized. Bancor argued that these abilities were necessary to protect the network and token holders in a state of emergency during a network‚Äôs early development years, and after their first three years of operation the BNT tokens would be upgraded and Bancor‚Äôs centralized control decreased. Foundation The Bancor Foundation, which offers grants and technical support to developers and organizations building applications using the Bancor Protocol, was originally chaired by monetary scholar Bernard Lietaer, who served as its Chief Monetary Officer from its inception in June 2017 until his passing in February 2019. In July 2019, the Bancor Foundation commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Bretton Woods Conference where the original ‚ÄúBancor‚Äù currency concept was proposed by hosting an event at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire (the original location of the 1944 conference). The event was keynoted by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Dr. Benn Steil, author of The Battle of Bretton Woods, Gillian Tett, U.S. Managing Editor of the Financial Times, and others.

He first appears in the thirteenth episode of the thirty-fourth series, first broadcast on 17 November 2018. Jafargholi's casting was announced on 1 August 2018 and he was invited to read for the role shortly after finishing filming on EastEnders. Marty is characterised as a young and fashionable student nurse with a \\"razor sharp wit\\". He is a confident nurse who has a blunt bedside manner and excellent clinical skills. Marty is introduced alongside fellow student nurse Jade Lovall (Gabriella Leon) and writers paired them as a double act tackling their final university placement in the emergency department (ED). Their \\"frenemies\\" relationship was used as light relief from the show's serious stories. Marty's stories include him lying to his boyfriend about being a single father and coming out to his parents. A negative response from his father sent Marty on a lonely \\"path of self-destruction\\", where he starts partying and having casual sex with strangers. Writers used the story to challenge his friendship with Jade, which Jafargholi disliked. His casual sex leads to him being the subject of racism and learning he may have contracted HIV. The character was given a family link to Kian Madani (Ramin Karimloo), a character on the show's spin- off series Holby City. Producers chose to explore their relationship and Marty appears in an episode of the show's twenty-second series. Television critics and viewers alike spoke positively about the character, with Helen Daly from the Radio Times calling him her \\"favourite nurse\\". Marty's friendship with Jade received a more mixed response; Sue Haasler of the Metro thought they made \\"an excellent double act\\" but disliked them being placed at odds. His partying story garnered an emotive response from critics, but a same-sex kiss featuring the character received 111 complaints.  Casting  Shaheen Jafargholi was cast as Marty. On 1 August 2018, Sophie Dainty, writing for entertainment website Digital Spy, reported that actor Shaheen Jafargholi had joined the cast of Casualty as new nurse Marty Kirkby. Jafargholi expressed his delight at joining the cast as he had been a fan of the show, and later called it \\"an honour [...] to become a small part of this legacy\\". On Jafargholi's casting, Lucy Raffety, the show's series producer, commented, \\"He is a huge talent with such a warm screen presence and we know he will bring so much to the show.\\" Jafargholi was invited to read for the part in early 2018, shortly after he concluded filming for his role as Shakil Kazemi at EastEnders. He had planned to have a break but upon reading the script for Casualty, he decided to read for the part. He then went on holiday and upon his return, he learnt he had been offered the role. He then began filming in July 2018. The actor commuted between Cardiff, where the show is filmed, and his home in London for the role. While filming for the show, Jafargholi would stay in a hotel before returning to his home at the weekend. He did not mind doing this as he found the commute easy. The actor is also Welsh and expressed his delight at working in Wales. Jafargholi joined the cast alongside actress Gabriella Leon, who portrays Jade Lovall. She was pleased about this and dubbed him her \\"partner in crime\\". He also liked this and thought it would have been scary to start alone, so he was pleased to work with Leon to start with. Jafargholi was attracted to the role of Marty as it differed to the character of Shakil. He liked that Marty was older and a similar age to himself, but also found that the change in age meant he had to alter \\"mindset\\". Jafargholi was employed to the regular cast and hoped that Marty would establish his own \\"place\\" on the show. The actor struggled to learn the medical terminology involved with the show and often relied on the medical advisors on-set for help. He also found himself not knowing what the terminology meant when he was saying it. Jafargholi explained that he spends a lot of time researching the terminology to understand it better, and spoke to his mother, who works in a hospital, for advice on how to make the dialogue appear \\"natural\\" and \\"smooth\\". He received positive feedback from his mother's colleagues about his pronunciation. Jafargholi previously appeared in Casualty, as a patient in the eighteenth series episode \\"Inside Out\\", when he was six years old. He had forgotten about the role until he auditioned for the role of Marty, and joked that he believes that the patient grew up to be Marty. Jafargholi found that he could relate to co-star Maddy Hill, who portrays Ruby Spark, as she appeared on EastEnders before joining Casualty like him. He said that he \\"[looked] up\\" to Hill and enjoyed working with her.  Development  Characterisation = Marty is introduced as a 22-year- old student nurse who is billed as \\"sassy\\", funny and fashionable. Jafargholi described him as \\"sharp-tongued and witty\\", \\"sarcastic\\" and sometimes too much. Similarly, Raffety said that Marty has a \\"razor sharp wit\\". On his character's sarcasm, Jafargholi commented, \\"He never misses an opportunity for a sarcastic comment!\\" He also labelled the character \\"mischievous\\", \\"cheeky\\", fun and \\"playful\\". Marty's wit and intensity can sometimes cause him to clash with other people. Jafargholi thought that Marty's persona makes him appear as a \\"know-all\\", and believed that he should be less divisive. He told Katie Baillie from the Metro that Marty has good intentions, but his actions do not always reflect this and he can often speak out of turn. He added that his inexperience, resulting from his young age, means he sometimes \\"puts his foot in his mouth\\". Jafargholi thought that although Marty is \\"very hardworking\\", he does not focus enough and instead \\"combines work and pleasure\\". Marty is a confident nurse who is ambitious about his career. Despite his blunt bedside manner, which some patients dislike about him, he has \\"flawless\\" clinical skills and technical ability, which establish him as a perfect fit for his job. In Marty's eyes, nursing is the \\"holy grail of occupations\\". Jafargholi stated that in his job, Marty is \\"eager and keen to do well\\". He added that Marty has much \\"energy and enthusiasm\\" for his job. In his career, Marty always wants to improve and achieve a \\"position of power\\"; he plans on becoming a nursing manager before he turns 36 years old. Jafargholi explained that Marty will eventually organise himself and become the nurse he needs to be. The character's fictional backstory states that he decided to become a nurse at a young age and his ambition to achieve this set him apart from his peers at school. However, his social skills and trend-spotting prevented him from becoming a \\"social outcast\\". Marty is openly gay and is quick to fall in love, which is his Achilles' heel. He is often left heartbroken after the breakdown of his relationships and has to remind himself that he cannot plan out of his love life. Despite this, Marty wants to \\"settle down\\" and have a family of his own. Jafargholi dubbed Marty a \\"hopeless romantic\\". = Introduction = Marty is introduced in the show's 1106th episode, which is within the thirty-third series, broadcast on 17 November 2018. He arrives at Holby City Hospital's emergency department (ED) for his final university placement as a student nurse. Jafargholi told Laura Donaldson of OK! magazine that Marty is excited to start work. He also explained that Marty wants to perform well at work and impress his new colleagues. To capture his first day at the ED, Marty uses his smartphone to record video messages. Marty is mentored by senior staff nurse Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka) and joins the ED with fellow student nurse Jade Lovall (Leon). Jafargholi explained that Marty and Jade create an unexpected \\"burst of energy and life\\" when they arrive in the ED. The character's introduction was previewed in the show's seasonal trailer, released on 5 October 2018. A preview clip of Marty's debut was released on 16 November 2018 to further promote his introduction. Marty soon learns that his new work environment is tougher than initially expected. Raffety noted that Marty would soon realise that his new job requires more than \\"a cheeky wink and a clever one-liner\\". Jafargholi told the Radio Times David Brown that Marty is quickly \\"put through [his] paces\\" after he joins. Following his introduction, Marty finds himself in trouble with Louise and staff nurse Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson), who he works closely with. Jafargholi explained that Louise would start reprimanding Marty for his inappropriate behaviour. Marty develops an admiration for the department's clinical lead, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), and her fashion sense. Jafargholi told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that Marty likes Connie's vigour and personality and sees her as \\"a goddess\\", but often forgets that she is his boss. He added that he wanted writers to establish a friendship between Marty and Connie. In his early scenes, Marty compliments Connie's high-heels, which Jafargholi thought summarised his personality. Marty shares scenes with charge nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) and Jafargholi said that he enjoyed filming with Thompson. Gareth David-Lloyd was introduced as Marty's love interest. Writers reintroduced \\"dishy doctor\\" Joshua Bowers (Gareth David- Lloyd) as a love interest for Marty. When he takes Robyn's daughter Charlotte to the hospital creche, Marty meets Joshua, who assumes that Marty is Charlotte's father. He decides not to correct him, so he can get closer to Joshua. They continue to grow closer and go on dates involving Charlotte and Joshua's daughter. Inside Soap 2019 preview for Casualty revealed that Robyn would discover that Marty has been claiming that he is Charlotte's dad in upcoming episodes. The story concludes when Robyn and Joshua meet at the hospital creche. Marty is unable to collect Charlotte as he is experiencing a shift with the paramedic team and becomes worried that his lies will be exposed. Robyn and Joshua discovering the truth coincides with a bad day for Marty as he lets down Louise with work and paramedics Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) and Ruby Spark (Maddy Hill) eject him from the ambulance for his poor attitude. All these events leave Marty \\"ashamed and remorseful\\", so he decides to apply for a new placement elsewhere. However, he changes his mind following encouragement from Louise. = Friendship with Jade Lovall = Writers paired Marty with Jade as a double act tackling their first months working in the ED. They used them for light relief from the show's serious storylines. Simon Harper, the show's executive producer, thought they made a \\"brilliant, comic partnership\\", and Raffety opined that Marty and Jade would bring \\"a whirlwind of life and fun\\" to the ED. The characters regularly clash and were dubbed \\"frenemies\\" who share an \\"interesting Clash of the Titans friendship\\" by Leon. The actress pointed out that there is a difference in \\"attitudes and personality\\" between Marty and Jade. Jafargholi confirmed that the rivalry between Marty and Jade would develop into a friendship, and said that he enjoyed portraying comedic stories within a \\"predominantly serious\\" drama. Writers established the relationship between Marty and Jade in his first two episodes. Jafargholi noted that the pair's relationship \\"on a friendship level and a work level as colleagues\\" is explored. He enjoyed exploring the dynamics of the friendship and thought that comedic moments were created between them. They regularly play games and have competitions in their work. Additionally, they each want to \\"one-up each other\\". Jafargholi explained that his relationship with Jade causes Marty's \\"competitive side\\" to emerge and leads to Marty doing things that he should not do. Marty and Jade soon discover whether their humour will work in the stressful work environment. Marty often accepts praise for Jade's work. Jafargholi and Leon agreed that the characters were both \\"sneaky\\". Leon thought that the characters shared a \\"real genuine connection\\" as they joined the ED at the same time and revealed that they would support each other. The actors enjoyed working with each other and felt it made their characters' connection \\"organic\\". Marty and Jade clash over treating Rufus Addams (Kriss Dillon), a patient who they find attractive. Marty is assigned to Rufus' care but Jade becomes jealous and tries to assist. Upon learning more about Rufus, they become \\"smitten\\" with him and argue over who should treat him, deciding to have a competition. However, Jade takes the competition \\"too far\\" and locks Marty in a cupboard, leaving him in danger when he has an asthma attack. Jafargholi explained that Marty and Jade's \\"competitive nature\\" is the cause of the attack and observed that they would be in a better position if they had supported each other. In another scenario, Louise reprimands Marty and Jade for not working while on-shift and warns them to reconsider their attitudes. Marty realises that Jade is \\"dragging him down\\", so rejects her in favour of his career. On his shift, Marty works hard and when Louise notices, she recommends him for a shift working with the paramedic team. Writers decided to further test Marty and Jade's relationship by having her move into his share house. Off-screen, Jafargholi and Leon live together in a flat, which the former found to be a reflection of the show. = Family = Kian Madani, portrayed by Ramin Karimloo (pictured), is Marty's cousin. Kian Madani (Ramin Karimloo) was introduced to Casualty spinoff series, Holby City, in April 2019 and in his character biography, he was established as Marty's cousin. Karimloo was excited about the connection and hoped to guest star in Casualty. He wanted producers to explore the relationship as he felt there was the opportunity for a compelling story, but appreciated that it was difficult as Casualty is filmed in Cardiff and Holby City is filmed in Borehamwood. In May 2019, Raffety confirmed plans to explore Marty's family life, which was previewed in the show's seasonal trailer, released on 14 June 2019. The story had been teased in previous episodes. After patient Amy Wakes (Carol Starks) is injured in a homophobic attack, Marty sympathises with her and reveals that he is not out to his parents. Marty and Jade later compete for a nursing bursary, which Marty is awarded. Jade is jealous of the results and reads his personal statement. It details how Marty was bullied as a child and kept his sexuality a secret because of his Iranian background. Jade is upset that Marty has not told her about his past and when his father, Graham Kirkby (Philip Wright), calls, she invites him to the award ceremony. After Marty admits that he is not out to his parents, Jade panics, and claims to be his girlfriend to avoid outing him. Marty's sexuality was further explored by having him come out to his parents. Marty brings Jade to a family party, where she impresses Marty's parents. However, the party ends when Marty's mother, Bibi Kirkby (Badria Timimi), collapses and is admitted to the ED. On the ward, Bibi admits to Marty that she knows he is gay and accepts him, delighting Marty. However, she warns him that she is not confident that Graham will react similarly. Marty ignores Bibi's advice and comes out to Graham, who devastates Marty by rejecting him. The story was mirrored in the episode with that of a patient who wanted to be accepted after coming out as a trans woman. = Rejection and partying = Writers incorporated Marty's rejection from his father into his next story as he starts partying frequently. Jafargholi explained that Marty has \\"a void\\" following his father's rejection. Jack Hardwick was cast as Jack Ward, a new love interest for Marty, which was revealed in the show's seasonal trailer, released on 6 December 2019. Sue Haasler from the Metro described Jack as \\"the ideal man ‚Äì kind, generous and, most importantly, mad about Marty\\". Marty is elated with his new relationship and upon opening up about his previous struggles as an Iranian-British gay man, Jack confesses his love for Marty, who decides to commit to Jack by deleting his dating apps. However, he becomes upset after receiving a text from Graham, reminding him about his rejection. Marty goes to work where he treats pilot Liam Barnett (Patrick Baladi), but upon contacting Liam's husband, he discovers that his husband is Jack. Marty tries to save his relationship with Jack, but he rejects him and claims that they have different backgrounds. Marty leaves the ED \\"angry and heartbroken\\" and goes to a local bar. Jafargholi thought that Marty should start \\"thinking with his head rather than his heart\\". Over a series of episodes, Marty's erractic behaviour was intensified, which also challenged his friendship with Jade. Writers took Marty on a lonely \\"path of self- destruction\\" as he begins to have sex with strangers, taking drugs and getting drunk, following his father's rejection. Jafargholi was disappointed with the challenges in Marty and Jade's friendship as he found it to be a highlight of the characters. He hoped that they would reconcile eventually. Jade first becomes concerned about him after he arrives to work hungover and lies to Charlie about needing a day off, but Marty accuses Jade of being jealous. Marty becomes the subject of racism when an online hook-up rejects him for his skin colour, leaving him \\"shocked, and utterly humiliated\\". Marty continues to struggle and when he is late for his shift, Jade covers for him. Jafargholi told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Jade is trying to be \\"a good friend\\" to Marty, but instead becomes involved in his lies. He pointed out that Marty \\"relies on Jade in a way he shouldn't\\" and added that Marty takes Jade \\"for granted\\". Marty bonds with terminally ill patient Dean Dunston (Tony Hirst) and confides in him about his struggles. Dean encourages Marty to speak to Jade, but before they can talk, Jade ends their friendship, having covered for Marty again. He is devastated and feeling isolated, he seeks out another hook up. Casualty introduced the use of NHS rainbow badges in their costumes to coincide with Marty's story. The suggestion was made by This Morning resident doctor, Ranj Singh, who asked Harper if the drama could feature them as a reflection on the NHS, who use the badges as a message of inclusion. Harper liked the idea and incorporated the badges into Marty's story. To maintain continuity, the badges were also introduced to Holby City and were incorporated into a sexuality story. Writers created a turning point in the story when Marty discovers his casual sex and drug taking has put him at risk of contracting HIV. When HIV- positive patient Danny Butler (Anthony Selwyn) is admitted to the ED, it becomes apparent that Marty, who is treating him, recognises him. Danny does not remember Marty and admits that he has not been taking his HIV medication, leaving Marty \\"devastated\\" as they had unprotected sex the previous night. Struggling with his discovery, Marty breaks down and is comforted by Jade, who promises to support him after he opens up to her about his recent struggles. Marty sees the experience as \\"a much-needed wake-up call\\" and arranges an appointment at the local sexual health clinic, before deciding not to priortise partying over friends. The story was developed in an episode which was pulled from broadcast. The episode, which features the ED team dealing with a viral outbreak, was deemed \\"inappropriate\\" because of parallels to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The following episode, which aired in its place, began with an extended preview of the missed episode and revealed that the episode was \\"integral to Marty's character development\\". Plans to air the skipped episode, titled \\"Code Orange\\", were announced in September 2020, four months after being cancelled. Kate Oates, the Head of Continuing Drama at BBC Studios, expressed her pride at the episode and thought that viewers would be \\"delighted to watch the never-before-seen moments\\". The episode features Marty being tested for HIV and addressing his issues with drugs and partying, before arriving for chaotic shift as the ED deals with a lockdown following a chemical attack. In the department, Marty soon encounters Graham, who tells his son that he cannot accept his sexuality; Marty confronts Graham over his behaviour and reveals that he may have contracted HIV, worrying Graham. However, Graham soon becomes unwell after being infected by the chemical nerve agent, devastating Marty as he is unable to reconcile with his father. However, upon speaking to Graham's neighbour, Julia Ford (Kate Anthony), he realises that Graham does love him. = Other appearances = A crossover event, \\"CasualtyXHolby\\", between Casualty and its spinoff series, Holby City, was planned in 2018. The casts of both shows were featured in the crossover, including Jafargholi as Marty. Harper explained that both casts would be featured \\"striving heroically against the odds in two episodes of pure, nail- biting, taut, emotional medical drama.\\" In the episodes, Marty works with consultants Dylan Keogh (William Beck) and Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) to treat a patient. The episode was filmed in November 2018 and first broadcast in March 2019. Marty appears in a Children in Need interactive sketch, released on 9 October 2019 for the 2019 telethon. In the sketch, Marty and other characters, including Connie, Charlie, Archie Hudson (Genesis Lynea) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford), ask viewers various medical questions. The sketch was directed by Mealing and was filmed in a single take. As part of plans to increase crossovers between Casualty and Holby City, Jafargholi reprised the role of Marty in Holby City again. Plans for the crossover were announced in August 2019 by Holby City series producer Jane Wallbank, who explained that Marty's relationship with Kian would be explored. She teased that they share some \\"family secrets\\". Marty appears in the 1010th episode of Holby City, which is within the twenty-second series, broadcast on 15 January 2020. Marty's appearance coincides with a story exploring Kian's mental wellbeing. Worried about his cousin, Marty visits Kian at his office and warns him to \\"slow down\\". When Kian does not listen to him, Marty speaks to his colleague Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), who also ignores Marty's concern. However, after he collapses, Kian reveals to Jac that he had a morphine addiction and Marty had helped him recover.  Reception  For his portrayal of Marty, Jafargholi was nominated for Best Drama Star at the 2020 Inside Soap Awards.

Ridley (February 2, 1934 ‚Äì September 28, 2019) was an American college basketball player. He was an All-American and All-Big Ten player for the Illinois Fighting Illini. Ridley, a diminutive but quick point guard, went to Taylorville High School in Taylorville, Illinois While there, he was a unanimous all-state performer as a senior in 1952. He chose to play for coach Harry Combes at Illinois as a part of a strong recruiting class that also included in-state players Bruce Brothers and twins Phil and Paul Judson. After sitting out what would have been his freshman season per NCAA eligibility rules of the time, Ridley joined the varsity team for the 1953‚Äì54 season, averaging 6.0 points per game in a supporting role. He moved into the starting lineup in his sophomore season, raising his scoring average to 15.2 points per game and was named third-team All-Big Ten Conference by the United Press International (UPI), who also named him to their national \\"Small-America\\" team of the top players under . In Ridley's senior season, the Illini started a potent scoring lineup with Brother, Paul Judson and George Bon Salle in the frontcourt with Ridley running the attack from the perimeter. Ridley led the team's fast break, using his speed and ballhandling to push the ball ahead off of the team's strong rebounding ability. Ridley finished the year averaging 15.3 points per game and at the close of the season was named All-Big Ten and as a third-team All-American by both the Associated Press (AP) and UPI. Following the close of his college career, Ridley's size made a National Basketball Association career difficult.

Production The design was built by the Bayfield Boat Yard in Canada from 1978 to 1983, with 350 boats completed, but it is now out of production. Design The Bayfield 29 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fibreglass, with wood trim. It has a cutter rig with anodized aluminum spars, a clipper bow, a conventional transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller, or optional Edson wheel, and a fixed long keel. The design has no provisions for a spinnaker and has been noted as having a small cockpit. It has a book displacement of and carries of ballast. Company president Jake Rogerson noted in 1985 that the boats were over-built and the actual displacement is probably closer to . The boat has a draft of with the standard keel. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 2GM diesel engine of for docking and manoeuvring. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The design has sleeping accommodation for five people, with two straight settees in the main cabin, one of which converts to a double and two quarter berths aft, one on each side. Unconventionally there is no bow \\"V\\" berth and instead the bow is occupied by a large head, instead. The galley is located on the starboard side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is \\"L\\"-shaped and is equipped with a two-burner alcohol-fired stove, an icebox and a stainless steel sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the port side. The cabin is an open plan design, but has wooden panels built into the gallery counter and the chart table, that can be raised for privacy. The interior was delivered with unfinished teak. The design has a PHRF-LO racing average handicap of 213. Operational history A review in Canadian Yachting from May 1985, just after production ended, by Carol Nickle & Bryan Gooderham stated, \\"The 29 is as traditional in appearance as a fibreglass production yacht can be. Its springy sheer line concludes forward in a bowsprit/platform; the silhouette is high; the underwater shape features a deep forefoot and a long, full keel with rudder attached; and the modest sail area is distributed in a cutter rig, with no provision for a spinnaker. The bow sections are fairly full, and the beam compares with those of some larger performance-oriented yachts.\\" They concluded, \\"in summary, we found the Bayfield 29 to be a comfortable, sturdy design with oceangoing capability, appealing most to the cruising couple or the single-handed sailor.\\" In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"the Bayfield 29 has a full keel, cutter rig (two head sails), a shallow draft, and a built- in bowsprit (complete with stylized wooden trail boards on either side of its bow). It is an out-and-out cruising boat, and like its smaller counterpart, the Bayfield 25, it only starts to come alive when the winds picks up ... Two points about the Bayfield 29 - it has a relatively small cockpit, and if you don't count the bowsprit, its hull length is more like 27.5 to 28 feet.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Alberg 29 *C&C; 29 *Cal 29 *Hunter 290 *Island Packet 29 *Mirage 29 *Northwind 29 *Prospect 900 *Tanzer 29 *Thames Marine Mirage 29 *Watkins 29 References Category:Keelboats Category:Dinghies Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Bayfield 29"},{"id":"64111596","text":"Tony Klimek (November 24, 1925 ‚Äì August 21, 2012) was an American football defensive end.

Personal life and education Maud Adeline Ford was born in May 1872 in Marylebone in London, the eldest child of Matthew Ford, a butler and house steward, and Ellen Catherine (n√©e MacDonald). She was baptised in July 1872. She trained as a teacher at Hockerill College in Bishop's Stortford, Essex, and worked as headmistress of St Andrews Girls School in Willesden in 1893, then from 1894 as headmistress of Baroness Burdett-Coutts School in Highgate, both girls' secondary schools. In 1897 she became resident tutor at Homerton College, Cambridge, marrying the principal, John Horobin, shortly thereafter. By the time of Horobin's early death in 1902, they had two daughters and a son. One of their daughters, Norah Horobin, went on to become a teacher and ended her career as headmistress of Roedean School. Their son, Ian, would become a Conservative Member of Parliament. Maud briefly served as acting principal at Homerton College until 1904, when she married Cloudesley Brereton, with whom she would have two sons.Anne Clendinning, Demons of Domesticity: Women and the English Gas Industry, 1889‚Äì1939 (Routledge, 2017), electronic edition (unpaginated). Preview available on Google Books. She was supportive of the women's suffrage cause.  Career  Mrs M. A. Cloudesley Brereton It was as \\"Mrs M. A. Cloudesley Brereton\\" that she became known as a social and sanitary reformer, and the author of The Mother‚Äôs Companion (1909), a book of advice for modern wives which promoted equality within marriage. When the British Commercial Gas Association was founded in 1911, she became editor of their Gas Journal (1912‚Äì1932). Much of her work was based on the concept of using gas and its technology to alleviate drudgery in the home as a way to improve the health of women and children. She became a leading figure in the campaign for gas, rather than electricity, to be the main source of domestic power. Brereton pushed the gas company managers to use and listen to the feedback from their lady demonstrators, as she believed that this would improve two-way communication between the consumers and producers of gas, and ensure that the domestic difficulties of customers could be factored into provision. She also advised the gas companies to consult with \\"well-educated lady advisors\\". In 1907 she was decorated as an Officier d'Academie by the French government for \\"services to International Public Health\\". She was Chairman of the Association for Education in Industry and Commerce in 1923-4 and latterly President of the organisation. She also became a member of the Royal Institute of Public Health and in 1926 became the first female Honorary Fellow of the Institution of Sanitary Engineers, as well as being a member of the Institute of Journalists, vice president of the Society of Women Journalists. She was an early member of the Women's Engineering Society and contributed articles and information to the journal The Woman Engineer in the 1920s. She was a member of the Efficiency Club and served as its president in 1931-2. She was also a member of the Soroptimists. She retired in 1932 and died in Norfolk on 16 April 1946.

He ruled the Akure Kingdom from June 22, 1897 until 1957. His lineal descendants are today known as the House of Adesida, part of the Ojijigogun Royal House. The Ojijigoguns serve as one of Akure's two legally recognized royal families. Early life Oba Adesida I was born as Prince Olofinlade Afunbiowo as the youngest son of Oba Ojijigogun (c. 1790-1882), the Deji of Akure from 1852-1882 and one of his wives, Olori Adojolomo Lagokun (c.1810-1890), daughter of Chief Lagokun, the Sashere of Idanre, around the year 1832. He had two older half brothers Prince Alebiosu Obadua, later Arosoye I and Prince Ifaturoti Adegoroye, and many other siblings. Through his father, he claimed hereditary kinship with all of the preceding rulers of both Akure and the neighbouring kingdoms of Ijeshaland and Ikereland. His father was the son of Oba Arakale, who was executed by the Benin Empire, and his older uncle was Oba Osupa I. Several years before his birth, in 1818, the Kingdom of Benin had invaded his father's homeland and executed Oba Arakale, his paternal grandfather. The invaders spared his father's family, and they lived in Benin until the 1830s. Through his mother, he was a descendant of the Sashere of Idanre, Chief Lagokun. His father, Ojijigogungara (Ojijigogun), ruled Akure from 1852 until his death in 1882. Marriage and children As a monarch, Oba Adesida had many wives and at least 12 children. One of his wives was Olori Olojo Adesida (nee Ademua), the daughter of the King Alani of Idoani. Three of his children became future Dejis of Akure, and his oldest son was one of the first western educated Akure natives. Prominent grandchildren of his include Oba Afunbiowo II, the musician King Sunny Ade, and the medical practitioner and historian Dr. Olawunmi Akintide. Reign In 1882, the Deji of Akure - his father Oba Ojijigogun - died. This created a vacancy in the office, and several eligible princes sought the throne, including Olofinlade's two siblings, Arosoye and Ifaturoti, and his first cousin, Odundun I. Oba Odundun was ultimately selected, and was crowned shortly afterwards. Adesida sought the throne again in 1890 when Odundun died but lost once again, this time to his older brother. He finally won in 1897 and ruled thereafter for 60 years, the longest reign in Akure history. Oba Adesida I's rule was characterized by increased British occupation and the amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914. His cooperation with British authorities earned him the respect of the British rulers, and Queen Elizabeth II greeted him on her visit to Nigeria in 1956. Unlike many Yoruba rulers who also worshipped the traditional orisha of the Yoruba religion, Oba Adesida I welcomed Christian missionaries to Akure. In addition, his support for the British occupation can be seen from the fact that he sided with the colonial government when they introduced the first income tax, even when Akure people rioted and attacked him in his palace. He also supported the creation of the first church and primary school in Akure, leading his rule to be known as a \\"Golden Age of Akure\\" in terms of cultural transformation and education. Death and legacy Oba Adesida I died in 1957 at the estimated age of 125. His exact birth date is unknown as there were no written records in the 1830s. He was succeeded by his son under the regnal name Adesida II, and his progeny ruled Akure for another 42 years until the military government of Ondo State created the House of Osupa and subsequently placed a supposed descendant of Oba Osupa I on the throne thereafter. Two of his other sons also succeeded him as Oba Adesida III and Oba Adesida IV. His grandson was Oba Afunbiowo II. A prominent member of the Adesida royal family is King Sunny Ade, a world famous juju singer, who is Oba Adesida I's grandson through his daughter, Princess Maria Adegeye Adeniyi. Adesida I's legacy has been documented extensively by Dr. Olawunmi Akintide, his grandson and a one-time secretary of the Omoremilekun Asodeboyede ruling house, who wrote his biography The Lion King and the Cubs.

Facts On 21 May 2004, Major Christopher Cox, an officer serving with the British in Germany, was riding his bicycle on the side of a road when a car left the road and hit him, causing fatal injuries to him. The driver was a German national resident. He was insured by a German insurance company, Ergo Versicherung AG. The governing law of the insurance policy was German law. The claim was brought by Major Cox's widow, Katerina. After the accident, she returned to England where she remained since the accident. After returning to England Mrs Cox entered into a new relationship and had two children with her new partner. All parties accepted that liability of the driver of the car and his insurer were governed by German law. It was also common ground that under German law his widow had a direct right of action against the insurer for such loss as she would have been entitled to recover from him. She sued the insurers in England for bereavement and loss of dependency. Liability was not disputed, but there was disagreement relating to the amount of damages. The key issues were (1) whether the damages fall to be determined by German law or English law, and (2) if the answer is English law, whether the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 apply. The issues as to damages between Mrs Cox and the insurers was heard and determined as a preliminary issue. Major Cox died before the Rome II Regulation came into force, and so the case was determined under the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995. Judgment Lord Sumption. =Lord Sumption= Lord Sumption gave the lead judgment. Lord Sumption noted that English law and German law were broadly similar, but that under English law Mrs Cox would have the benefit of two additional claims over what she would have under German law: # Damages awarded to a widow under the German B√ºrgerliches Gezetzbuch (or \\"BGB\\") would take account of any legal right to maintenance by virtue of a subsequent remarriage or a subsequent non-marital relationship following the birth of a child (Mrs Cox had subsequently taken a new partner, and had children with them after returning to England). Section 3(3) of the Fatal Accidents Act expressly excludes remarriage or the prospect of remarriage as a relevant consideration in English law. # Section 844 of the BGB confers no right to a solatium for bereavement. Under section 823 of the BGB the widow may in principle be entitled to compensation for her own pain and suffering, but this would require proof of suffering going beyond normal grief and amounting to a psychological disturbance comparable to physical injury. He then summarised the core issue thus: > English rules of private international law distinguish between questions of > procedure, governed by the law of the forum, and questions of substance, > governed by the lex causae. The issue in the present case is whether Mrs Cox > is entitled to rely on the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Fatal > Accidents Act 1976.Cox v Ergo, para 12. He then reviewed the leadings cases, including Harding v Wealands [2006] 2 AC 1 and Boys v Chaplin [1971] AC 356 and approved the test set out by Lord Hoffman in the earlier case to the effect that: > In applying this distinction to actions in tort, the courts have > distinguished between the kind of damage which constitutes an actionable > injury and the assessment of compensation (ie damages) for the injury which > has been held to be actionable. The identification of actionable damage is > an integral part of the rules which determine liability. As I have > previously had occasion to say, it makes no sense simply to say that someone > is liable in tort. He must be liable for something and the rules which > determine what he is liable for are inseparable from the rules which > determine the conduct which gives rise to liability. Thus the rules which > exclude damage from the scope of liability on the grounds that it does not > fall within the ambit of the liability rule or does not have the prescribed > causal connection with the wrongful act, or which require that the damage > should have been reasonably foreseeable, are all rules which determine > whether there is liability for the damage in question. On the other hand, > whether the claimant is awarded money damages (and if so, how much) or, for > example, restitution in kind, is a question of remedy. Applying the test he held that \\"I consider that the relevant German damages rules are substantive.\\"Cox v Ergo, para 17. He then turned to consider the applicability of the Fatal Accidents Act. He considered that the English rules were procedural. Accordingly, he found himself in the same difficulty as the Court of Appeal in how to square the different approaches of German and English law - if he applied the English common law rules (but without the Fatal Accidents Act) then Mrs Cox would have no claim at all under the old common law rules. He referred to the observations of Lord Parker CJ in Phrantzes v Argenti [1960] 2 QB 19 at 35, that in support of a foreign cause of action, the remedies afforded by English law \\"must harmonise with the right according to its nature and extent as fixed by the foreign law.\\" Ultimately he refused to be drawn into mental gymnastics and stepped back and held: \\"The English court must apply its own rules of assessment, then what rules are these, if not those of the Fatal Accidents Act? I do not think that it is necessary to resort to analogies, because English law does provide a remedy that harmonises with the German law right, namely damages.\\" Accordingly, he cut across the procedural / substantive issue to use the English methods of quantifying the allowable German heads of loss. He noted: \\"It is not at all satisfactory that such significant consequences should turn on difficult and technical considerations of the kind considered in the previous paragraph.\\" He felt that the rational answer is that someone in Mrs Cox's position should recover in respect of a German cause of action what she would have recovered in a German court, and noted that although it did not affect this case, that this had now been achieved by changing the law under the Rome II Regulation. =Lord Mance= Lord Mance gave a brief concurring judgment expanding upon certain points and reserving others for further consideration in the future.

Sydney highlighted her junior career by winning the Individual Bronze Medal at the North American Young Riders Championship in 2013.  Professional Career  Turning professional at the age of 18, Sydney continued to compete all over the United States and occasionally in Europe. Having many success in her career early on, Sydney competed in the USHJA International Hunter Derby Championships, hosted by the Kentucky Horse Park. Sydney began representing the United States of America in 2018 for show jumping. After a year, she switched to representing Israel in show jumping in January 2019. Her first win for the country was at Tryon International Equestrian Center in North Carolina, winning the Ingles Grand Prix CSI2*, in June 2019. Villamoura, the winning horse, produced many other wins with Shulman including topping the $36,000 International Jumper Accumulator Costume Class featured at the Washington International Horse Show, and later the same week winning, the $50,000 FEI 4* Speed Final, which caused Sydney to be named the Leading International Open Jumper Rider and Leading U25 Rider for 2019 at the event. In 2020, Sydney topped a competitive field to win the $37,000 Herm√®s Under 25 Grand Prix Series Semi-Final CSIO4*, hosted in Wellington, FL (USA), by the Winter Equestrian Festival. She continually has been ranked in the top 100 of the Rolex/USEF Show Jumping Ranking List since turning professional. While to continuing to compete at the top levels of Show jumping, Sydney offers training and sales services through her company Syd Shulman LLC, based in Wellington, FL, as well as helping her mother run Back Country Farms in Greenwich, CT.

Life Mary Crooke was born in London, the daughter of haberdasher, Edmond Tooke. She married the king's printer in Ireland, John Crooke. They had four sons and three daughters. After his death in 1669 Crooke's brother, Benjamin Tooke, who had been an apprentice to her brother, was granted the patent of the king's printer in Ireland. He held this patent in trust for Crooke and her sons, John and Andrew, who were still minors. In practical terms, this meant that Crooke became the king's printer and held a monopoly on the printing, binding, and selling of books in Ireland. This made her one of the earliest recorded women printers in Ireland, along with Jane Jones in the 1740s. Crooke operated from three premises in Dublin, Castle Street from 1670 to 1678, from King's Printing House, Skinner Row from 1678 to 1683, and then from Ormond Quay from 1683 to 1685. In 1677, she gave a silver cup to the Stationers' Company of London, and her apprentices in London were freed. Crooke's printing output was prodigious and her standards were low, while maintaining the business for her sons and resisting rival printers encroaching on her markets. She filed a petition against Thomas Bladen, who was forbidden to print, to the lord lieutenant in 1671, leading to his press being appropriated by the king's printer by order in 1673. In 1680 she took out a further petition against Joseph Ray, in which she was successful but which he ignored. When Crooke inherited the business it was heavily in debt, with her leadership it was profitable by the time her sons succeeded her. Tooke and Crooke's son John became joint king's printers of Ireland in March 1671, a position they held for their lives. In August 1671, Tooke declared his trusteeship of the office for Crooke and her sons by deed. As they reached age, Crooke took her sons in partnership, John in 1679 and Andrew in 1680, retaining half of the profits for herself and her other children, by deed, and a quarter each to her sons so long as they maintained the business. She transferred the Skinner Row printing house to her sons in 1681, while she continued to operate from Ormond Quay. Her son John died intestate in 1683, with Crooke granted administration. A dispute developed between Crooke and Andrew, leading to her dropping his name from official documents and Andrew running his Skinner Row printing press in rivalry to hers. Andrew filed two bills against Crooke on 3 November 1684 in the court of exchequer to negotiate for the patent rights of the king's printer. She replied by referring to the deed of 1680 which allowed her sons to share in the press' profits so long as they attended to the business, she complained that they had neglected the business, wasting stock-in-trade, and that Andrew set up his press in direct competition to hers. In 1685, an agreement was reached, with Crooke retiring that year, travelling to London to speed up the granting of the patent. It was granted to Andrew in 1686 with his partner Andrew Helsham assigned to Tooke as king's printers. Crooke made her will on 23 June 1685.

His research is based on magnetochemistry and computational chemistry, including on the design of high-temperature single molecule magnets, design of molecular spin qubits for quantum information and in developing methods and tools for modelling magnetic calculations.  Education  Chilton completed his Advanced Bachelor of Science (Honors) degree at Monash University in 2011 where he finished his final year project with Stuart R. Batten and Keith S. Murray. He completed his PhD on magnetochemistry at the University of Manchester, supervised by Richard Winpenny and Eric McInnes in 2015.  Research and career  Chilton completed postdoctoral research at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council National EPR facility in collaboration with the University of Manchester. In 2016, he was awarded the British Ramsay Memorial Fellowship (2016‚Äì2018) to research how Coordination chemistry can be used to engineer specific magnetic states of lanthanide ions. From 2017, He began work as a Senior Lecturer and a Royal Society University Research Fellow in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester. Chilton's research is generally based on computational chemistry and magnetochemistry, specifically on the design of high-temperature single molecule magnets, design of molecular spin qubits for quantum information, understanding paramagnetic MRI contrast agents, unravelling the electronic structure of uranium molecules, magnetic interactions between f-elements and in developing methods and tools for modelling magnetic calculations. = Notable work = In 2017, with David P. Mills, Chilton led research on the magnetic hysteresis at 60 Kelvin in dysprosocenium. This was the first time a higher temperature magnetic hysteresis had been observed, with the previous record being 30 K. The research introduced the ability to use liquid nitrogen instead of more expensive liquid helium during the magnetic hysteresis phenomenon which led to the attention of data storage server companies as the research introduced the potential of reducing both costs and energy requirements of data servers. Chilton has also collaborated in developing software to be used in chemical research. In 2013, with Alessandro Soncini he designed a computer program for the determination of the orientation of the magnetic anisotropy of the mJ = ¬±15/2 state of DyIII via electrostatic optimation of the aspherical electron density distribution. He also designed a program named PHI for the calculation of the magnetic properties of paramagnetic coordination complexes in the same year and in 2019, with Daniel Reta, designed CC-FIT2, a tool for the fitting of experimental AC magnetic data using the (generalised) Debye model, extraction of magnetic relaxation times with associated uncertainties, and fitting the temperature dependence of these data accosting for uncertainties in the underlying relaxation times = Awards, honours and nominations = * 2019: Royal Society University Research Fellowship * 2019: Olivier Kahn International Award * 2016: British Ramsay Memorial Fellowship * 2015 Dalton Young Researchers Award =Publications= His major publications include:  * * References Category:Living people Category:Australian chemists Category:Academics of the University of Manchester Category:21st-century chemists Category:Monash University alumni Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Nicholas F.

The rules' setting is based on TSR's role-playing game Empire of the Petal Throne. Publication history In 1975, TSR published M.A.R. Barker's fantasy role-playing game Empire of the Petal Throne, set in the land of T√©kumel. In his 2014 book Designers & Dragons, Shannon Appelcline noted that after publishing Empire of the Petal Throne, TSR \\"offered no roleplaying support for T√©kumel except in Dragon magazine, though they did put out one more T√©kumel strategy game, the miniatures-based Legion of the Petal Throne (1977).\\" Legions of the Petal Throne is a set of rules designed by Dave Sutherland that can be used for army-sized combat using military figurines. Basic combat rules are given, using a typical wargaming scale of 1:100. A more detailed and complex set of rules, including the use of magic, is also included. Reception In the October‚ÄìNovember 1978 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #9), John Norris commented that the rules \\"seem to have been well thought out and allow an interesting magical duel which both sides can use skilfully to influence the course of the battle without either swamping the combat with magic so that the former is almost irrelevant or reducing magic to an occasional unpredictable event that upsets the battle.\\" He complimented author Dave Sutherland for producing \\"a good simulation of the rather formal warfare characteristic of Tekumel, with lots of colourful detail.\\" However, given that the game was obviously related to the Empire of the Petal Throne RPG, Norris believed the lack of any type of role for individual characters from the RPG was \\"an obvious omission.\\" He concluded by giving the game a below average rating of 6 out of 10.

Two prototypes were built by Mitsubishi for the Imperial Japanese Navy. A development of the company's 3MT10 of 1932, the design differed primarily in the use of a radial engine and metal wing, which made the whole aircraft significantly lighter and faster. However, the design could not realise its potential as the wing was inefficiently stiff and the B4M was not selected for production. The competing Yokosuka B4Y was chosen to serve on the Navy's aircraft carriers instead. Design and development In 1933, the Japanese Navy still relied on the Mitsubishi B1M as the backbone of its carrier-borne attack force. The Yokosuka B3Y was starting to enter service, developed in response to the 7-shi, competition. However, already, the new aircraft was suffering engine reliability and other problems, and an early replacement was deemed expedient. The B3Y had seen off competition from Mitsubishi and Nakajima, and both were invited, along with Yokosuka, to enter a design to the ensuing 9-shi competition in February 1934. In response, Mitsubishi submitted a design based on their unsuccessful 7-shi entry, the 3MT10. However, instead of the bulky Rolls-Royce Buzzard V-12, a less powerful but lighter experimental Mitsubishi 8-Shi radial engine was fitted.Despite having an expected power rating of , substantially less than the of the Buzzard, the much reduced weight enabled the designer Hajime Matsuhara to substantially reduce the total weight of the aircraft by . Weight-saving measures included introducing aluminium wings and removing the wheel fairings. Overall, the effect of these changes were to increase the theoretical speed to . Matsuhara's final Ka-12 design was a single bay biplane of composite construction, with a fabric covered wooden frame fuselage and metal upper wings. The lower wings were of a new inverse gull shape, with fixed undercarriage attached to the wing and fuselage. The undercarriage had a wide track to allow for the carriage of a single torpedo or the equivalent weight in free-fall bombs. The three crew were seated in open cockpits and shared a total of three machine guns, two mounted on flexible mounts firing aft and a single fixed mounting firing forward. Operational history The first prototype was completed and first flew in August 1934. The aircraft was designated B4M1 by the Navy and flown against designs from both Nakajima and Yokosuka. Performance was considered superior to the aircraft in service, but the aircraft was unstable and difficult to fly. The lack of stiffness in the aluminium wing caused problems and the aircraft could not safely fly at its theoretical maximum speed. A second prototype designated was built with design changes, including a new nose fairing for the engine and a tailwheel instead of a skid, but these did not solve all the problems. The Navy rejected the design and the competing Yokosuka B4Y was chosen for production instead. However, Mitsubishi did gain some consolation from the outcome as they eventually produced 135 of the Yokosuka type.

She was part of the Brazilian research team who first sequenced the genome of the Zika virus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Go√©s de Jesus led the genomic and epidemiological studies at USP, and within two days of the first case in Brazil had sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome.  Early life and education  G√≥es de Jesus is from Salvador in Northeast Brazil. Her mother is a nursing technician and her father is a civil engineer. She was still a teenager when she decided to work in biomedical sciences. Her first research project involved investigations into HIV, which inspired her to pursue a career in global public health. She eventually studied biomedicine from the Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Sa√∫de P√∫blica. She moved to the Instituto Gon√ßalo Moniz for her graduate studies, where she worked toward a master's degree in biotechnology. After completing her master's degree, G√≥es de Jesus earned a doctoral degree at the Federal University of Bahia, where she specialised in human and experimental pathology. During her doctoral research she visited the University of Birmingham, where she was trained in nanopore sequencing.  Research and career  After earning her doctoral degree G√≥es de Jesus joined the University of S√£o Paulo Institute of Tropical Medicine as a S√£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) research fellow. She started working on the ZIBRA (Zika in Brazil Real Time Analysis) project, which looked to understand the spread of zika virus around Brazil. The ZIBRA project developed two mobile sequencing laboratories, in which they travelled Brazil looking to sequence 750 genomes. G√≥es de Jesus subsequently used the ZIBRA mobile sequencing units to study the epidemiology of a dengue virus outbreak which occurred in Brazil. The majority of infections occurred in S√£o Paulo state, and G√≥es de Jesus focussed her study on two municipalities (S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto and Araraquara). She identified that the strain of dengue virus during the 2019 outbreak was most similar to viruses found in Martinique and Guadeloupe. G√≥es de Jesus is part of the United Kingdom‚ÄìBrazil Centre for Arbovirus Discovery, Diagnosis, Genomics and Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Genomics and Epidemiology (CADDE), an epidemics monitoring project that looks to understand the circulation of arbovirus in Brazil and how it persists in non-epidemic periods. Alongside her academic work, G√≥es de Jesus is a popular science communicator, with a following of over 160,000 people on Instagram. = Leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic = During the COVID-19 pandemic, G√≥es de Jesus worked with Ester Cerdeira Sabino to sequence the genome of SARS- CoV-2. After receiving samples from the first infected Brazilian patient on February 26, she managed to sequence the genome in only 48 hours. Her efforts made it possible to differentiate the version of SARS-CoV-2 that was infecting people in Brazil to the one that first emerged in Wuhan in January 2020. G√≥es de Jesus identified that the version of SARS-CoV-2 that infected the first Brazilian patient was more akin to the German strain which emerged in late January than the original form, whilst the second form more similar to strains from the United Kingdom. In March 2020 her success was recognised by Legislative Assembly of Bahia. Pastor Isid√≥rio Filho emphasised the importance of G√≥es de Jesus' work.

Headley, the police chief of Miami, Florida, in response to an outbreak of violent crime during the 1967 Christmas holiday season. He accused \\"young hoodlums, from 15 to 21\\", of taking \\"advantage of the civil rights campaign\\" that was then sweeping the United States. Having ordered his officers to combat the violence with shotguns, he told the press that \\"we don't mind being accused of police brutality\\". The quote may have been borrowed from a 1963 quote from Birmingham, Alabama police chief Bull Connor. The quote was featured in Headley's 1968 obituary published by the Miami Herald. The quote was similarly used and possibly repeated by Headley himself in response to the 1968 Miami riots. Variations of the quote may have been used by other political figures, such as Alabama governor George Wallace, Philadelphia police commissioner and eventual mayor Frank Rizzo, and Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, and in 2020 by U.S. president Donald Trump. Headley's quote was initially criticized by The Miami Report for exacerbating the violence in the 1968 Miami riots. The quote was brought under scrutiny by the U.S. Congress in response to the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots. It was also scrutinized in retrospect to the violence caused during the 1980 Miami riots. Trump's usage of the quote during the 2020 George Floyd protests was flagged by Twitter for encouraging violence, and it was criticized by various politicians of U.S. cities and states. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to remove Trump's use of the phrase in a Facebook post led to criticism and protests by Facebook employees. Walter Headley, 1967 Chief Walter Headley was characterized in the 1969 Miami Report about the 1968 Miami riot for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence as a \\"strong-minded, hardworking police chief\\" who \\"carried virtually unchanged into the late 1960s policies of dealing with minority groups which had been applied in Miami in the 1930s and even earlier\\". This was an apparent reference to policies promulgated by Headley's immediate predecessor, Chief H. Leslie Quigg. Howard University political science professor Clarence Lusane clarified that Chief Headley \\"had a long history of bigotry against the Black community\\". =Response to the long hot summer of 1967= During the civil unrest in the United States that occurred during the long, hot summer of 1967, which were in part racially motivated, several nascent riots in Dade County, Florida, were stopped before they could start through the effort of local community leaders. However, law enforcement personnel began to prepare for further violence, as the causes of the unrest were never addressed and promises made by leaders went unfulfilled. The first known use of the phrase was in a press conference held by Miami's police chief, Walter Headley, on December 26, 1967. Headly announced that six three-man teams of officers equipped with \\"shotguns and dogs\\" would respond to the \\"young hoodlums\\" from \\"Negro districts\\" in Miami with lethal force and stated \\"his men have been told that any force, up to and including death, is proper when apprehending a felon\\". In a pithy soundbite during the post-statement interview with reporters, Headley claimed that Miami had avoided \\"civil uprising and looting\\" because he had \\"let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts\\". Headley clarified: \\"Felons are going to learn that they can't be bonded out from the morgue.\\" Florida Governor Claude Kirk expressed his support for Headley's tactics: \\"Let them all know they will be dealt with [harshly]. We have the weapons to defeat crime. Not to use them is a crime in itself.\\" Headley added \\"we don't mind being accused of police brutality.\\" In a follow-up press conference, Headley refused to say whether the policy of shooting looters would only be applied to Blacks, given his previous stances, leading to a heightened state of fear among the Black communities of Miami. A paraphrased version of his December 1967 remarks was quoted in his 1968 Miami Herald obituary: \\"There is only one way to handle looters and arsonists during a riot and that is to shoot them on sight. I've let the word filter down ‚Äî when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\\" Anecdotes were shared that City of Miami police officers had started aggressively enforcing its stop-and-frisk law by stopping Black males in public with no pretext, calling them belittling or racist epithets, then demanding identification and their purpose. Three weeks after the new policy started, Chief Headley declared that it had caused the violent crime rate to fall by 60%. In contrast to the continuous harassment by Miami police officers, the Dade County Public Safety Department built relationships between its deputy sheriffs and the Black community; although both the City of Miami and Dade County were judged to have effectively maintained order, the Miami Police Department were perceived to have revived prior racist policies. According to Lusane, Headley might have actually borrowed the phrase from infamous Birmingham, Alabama, police chief Bull Connor. Connor had declared in 1963 he would use dogs and fire hoses to quell unrest. =Response to 1968 Miami riot= In August 1968, riots broke out in Miami, at the time of the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. The first riot started in the Liberty City area on August 7 at approximately 6:30 p.m., marking the first major incident since Headley's get- tough policing policy had been announced in December 1967. continuation, page A-2 Black organizations had called for a noontime mass rally for \\"Blacks Only\\", attracted by rumors that Ralph Abernathy and Wilt Chamberlain would be speaking. As the crowd grew that afternoon, police responded and became the target of the crowd's ire. Traffic controls were enforced at 5 p.m. and the rally turned violent after the driver of a car with the sticker \\"George Wallace for President\\" blundered into the roadblocks, panicked, and abandoned the car, which was subsequently flipped and set ablaze. Rioting and looting was quieted by the police by 8:15 p.m., without significant incident. Politicians (including the Mayor of Miami, Stephen P. Clark; Mayor of Metropolitan Dade County, Charles Hall; Governor Kirk; and Ralph Abernathy) arrived and urged the crowd to negotiate peacefully, and with the officials' promise to meet to hear the community's grievances at 11 a.m. on August 8, the crowd dispersed. After the politicians reneged on their promise, the riot reignited on August 8. That day, in two separate incidents, two Black adults were killed by gunfire in Liberty City in the afternoon, then another was killed in the Central Negro District just before midnight. continuation, page A-8 A New York Times article published November 29, 1970, blamed Headley's approach for \\"three dead and a score wounded\\" during the riots. Headley was on vacation in the North Carolina mountains during the riots and refused to return to Miami, asserting that \\"my officers know what to do. They can handle the situation.\\" The same article from 1970 also stated that Headley had repeated the phrase \\"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\\" during the 1968 Miami riots, although contemporary coverage only brought up that line as Headley's stated policy from the December 1967 press conference. The Miami Report squarely blamed Headley's policies for exacerbating the violence of the riots. Following Headley's death in 1968, the \\"hardline-policy chief of the old school\\" was replaced by Chief Bernard L. Garmire, as part of an \\"attempt at racial introspection\\" which had included consulting a federally-funded social science study to examine what \\"engenders\\" white police officers' deep \\"fear and hatred of Blacks\\". In 1971, Garmire put 24 police dog units on full- time duty to combat \\"the specter of urban guerrilla warfare\\", adding that he had not rescinded Headley's order to carry shotguns, but denied that he would be adopting his predecessor's philosophies: \\"There will be no promiscuous shooting or turning of dogs on people.\\" Headley's comment and policy were the subject of congressional testimony about the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots in a question asked by congressman John Dowdy to police chief Patrick V. Murphy. Contemporary views, 1967‚Äì1968 Chief Headley's justifications of deadly force against rioters were echoed by other nationally prominent politicians, including presidential candidate George Wallace (in 1967/68), Philadelphia police commissioner Frank Rizzo (1968), and Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley (1968). =George Wallace, 1967‚Äì1968= Wallace's speeches during his 1968 Presidential campaign were widely publicized to contain similar sentiments as early as September 1967. Journalist John Pilger published an interview with Wallace in 1986, which Pilger dated to summer 1968\\\\. During the interview, Wallace said he would issue orders similar to Headley's, authorizing deadly force against looters: \\"Nigra or white starts lootin' and bam, bam, I'd have 'em shot on the spot. Yessuh, there'd be orders to shoot to kill if anyone so much as hurls a rock at a police officer. 'Don't shoot any chillun,' I'd tell 'em. 'Just shoot that adult standin' beside the kid that throws the rock.' That may not prevent the burnin' and lootin' but it sure will stop it after it starts.\\" =Frank Rizzo, 1967‚Äì1968= Although Frank Rizzo was credited by President Donald Trump with coining the phrase or \\"an expression like that\\" in a 2020 interview with Harris Faulkner, Rizzo never said \\"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\\" Rizzo served as the police commissioner of Philadelphia from 1967 to 1971, then resigned to run a successful campaign for mayor that year, serving from 1972 with a second term, until 1980. He was noted for his strict policies to prevent riots: \\"Hoodlums have no license to burn and sack Philadelphia in the name of civil liberties and civil rights activities.\\" Rizzo further explained his preventive tactics, which included stationing snipers on rooftops and deploying anti-riot squads armed with shotguns and machine guns, in an article published in the March 1968 issue of Esquire written by Garry Wills. One key to Rizzo's tactics was keeping police officers on standby for rapid deployment if necessary, which met with great approval from his peers. Another aspect was Rizzo's willingness to use \\"absolute force\\" to suppress riots. Rizzo's policy on quelling riots was paraphrased and quoted in the report Firearms, Violence, and Civil Disorders (1968). His policies were credited with preventing serious rioting in Philadelphia during the summer of 1967, while cities with a similar proportion of Black Americans, such as Detroit and Newark, were affected. The next year, Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. all experienced significant riots in April 1968 after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and a contemporary analysis by Drew Pearson gave credit to \\"one of the toughest cops in the USA\\", Commissioner Frank Rizzo, and his \\"well integrated\\" police force for preventing similar rioting in Philadelphia. Rizzo also was accused of encouraging brutal police tactics, which he denied: \\"I don't believe in police brutality and 99 per cent of the police have no part of it. Sure, there are isolated cases when a cop goes overboard, but who knows the right amount of force to use‚Äîand when?\\" Rizzo later clarified: \\"Our policemen are cool-headed professionals. We only use sufficient force.\\" However, the club-swinging police action led by Rizzo that broke up the November 1967 Philadelphia student demonstration resulted in a suit which alleged that excessive force had been used. The suit would be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. =Richard Daley, 1968= Mayor Richard J. Daley ordered police to shoot arsonists and looters during the 1968 Chicago riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968. Daley did not use the phrase \\"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\\", but stated to Police Superintendent James B. Conlisk \\"very emphatically and very definitely that an order be issued under [your] signature to shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a Molotov cocktail, and shoot anyone looting stores in our city\\". Upon hearing that Conlisk had directed patrolmen to use their own discretion, Daley remarked \\"I would assume any superintendent would issue orders to shoot any arsonist on sight... an arsonist is a murderer and should be shot right on the spot. The looters‚Äîyou wouldn't want to shoot the youngsters‚Äîbut you can shoot them and detain them.\\" Chief Headley supported Daley's position: \\"That could have been me talking.\\" (republished in Appendices to the Miami Report) However, Headley was reprimanded for his remarks of support and later clarified that he was strictly talking about the response to riots in Chicago, not general policing in Miami, (republished in Appendices to the Miami Report) and said that his officers had been instructed to \\"shoot when necessary\\". Looters, he said \\"should be given the opportunity to surrender to arrest\\" and if the looter resists, \\"anything it takes, including death, [should be used] to apprehend them.\\" (republished in Appendices to the Miami Report) Chicago under Daley also saw police violence soon after amid the 1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity.  Armed vigilantes  The 1980 Miami riots erupted in the Liberty City area after four white police officers were acquitted on charges of manslaughter. The four were part of the group that had beaten Black motorcyclist Arthur Lee McDuffie to death in December 1979 following a high-speed chase; they had initially covered up their role in his killing by reporting his injuries were caused by a traffic accident. Photographic coverage of the riots in the Miami Herald included armed National Guardsmen, vigilantes, and business owners defending properties from looters. In 1989, former Miami mayor Maurice Ferr√© was interviewed for the documentary film Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965 to 1985; during the interview, he partially blamed the attitude instilled by Chief Headley for both the armed vigilantes and the police force's inability to suppress the McDuffie riots: \\"There's a tradition that goes back to Chief Walter Headley whose famous statement ‚Äî famous in this community and the State of Florida ‚Äî is when the looting starts, the shooting starts. That's the tradition. This was a southern city which is what Miami was up until the arrival of the Cubans in 1960. And this community has changed totally. But the mentality of that police department continues; it has life, it has a history.\\" During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, approximately half the property damage was sustained by businesses owned by immigrants from South Korea; because Koreatown had largely been abandoned by the police, local business owners armed themselves to defend their businesses. =\\"You loot, we shoot\\"= \\"You loot we shoot\\" painted on flood-damaged house in New Orleans (Apr 2006) In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Sandy (2012), and Harvey (2017), would-be robbers were warned that vigilante deadly force would be used for property crimes through hand-painted signs that read \\"you loot, we shoot\\". Authorization of deadly force by police officers following natural disasters dates back at least as far as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, when Mayor Eugene Schmitz declared \\"The federal troops, which are now policing a portion of the city, as well as the regular and special members of the police force, have been authorized by me to kill any persons whomsoever, found engaged in looting the effects of any citizen or otherwise engaged in the commission of crime.\\" Reports of vigilantes shooting Black Americans in New Orleans during the aftermath of Katrina had circulated since 2005, most notably centered on the Algiers Point neighborhood. In 2010, The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported that officers of the New Orleans Police Department had been authorized to shoot looters, although none of the officers involved in 11 civilian shootings cited that order in their defense. Mayor Ray Nagin had requested a declaration of martial law in response to reports of widespread looting, but lacked the authority to declare it. British street artist Banksy repurposed the same phrase in a 2018 piece depicting a stockbroker fleeing the New York Stock Exchange with bundles of cash.  Donald Trump, 2020 Response to George Floyd protests= President Donald Trump used the phrase in a tweet on the evening of May 28‚Äì29, 2020, in response to increasingly violent nation-wide and international protests in response to the killing of George Floyd. Floyd was an African-American man killed in Minneapolis on May 25 by a white policeman who had knelt on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. Trump's tweet was flagged by Twitter with a \\"public interest notice\\" for \\"glorifying violence\\". As a result, the tweet could only be seen after users acknowledged a notice saying the tweet had violated Twitter's rules against encouraging violence, but otherwise it remained visible. The original tweet was shared again that afternoon in quotation marks by the White House Twitter account. The White House's tweet was also hidden and tagged by Twitter as \\"glorifying violence\\". In the aftermath of Trump's tweet, the mayors of Chicago (Lori Lightfoot) and Atlanta (Keisha Lance Bottoms) stated that Trump was giving a dog whistle to what they considered his racist base, authorizing the use of vigilante violence to quell rioting. According to Lightfoot: \\"Nobody is gonna sit and condone looting and violence. But to blanketly say as the president of the United States that you're encouraging people to be shot in the street? That‚Äôs what I'm concerned about and, frankly, everyone should be concerned about that. That's not leadership. That's cowardice. That's playing to a base with the biggest dog whistle possible.\\" Bottoms compared Trump's tweet to the ones Trump had made in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, adding: \\"He speaks and he makes it worse. There are times when you should just be quiet and I wish that he would just be quiet.\\" Kentucky governor Andy Beshear called on Trump to retract the original tweet. Trump later characterized the original tweet as a warning that looters pose the risk of being shot, not as a command to shoot looters. On the evening of May 29, after speaking with Floyd's family, he struck a more somber tone. He said that he was not aware of the phrase's \\"racially-charged history\\", adding that he did not know where the phrase had originated, and that his intent in using it was to say \\"when there's looting, people get shot and they die.\\" On June 11, 2020, Fox News' Harris Faulkner asked Trump if he knew who had originally said the phrase; Trump responded that he believed it had been the mayor of Philadelphia. Faulkner noted the correct origin (Headley, 1967) and meaning (shooting looters). Trump replied with a falsehood, that the phrase \\"also comes from a very tough mayor... Frank Rizzo\\"; Faulkner did not correct him a second time. =Facebook response= In the afternoon of May 29, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a personal statement that he found the comments (which had been posted to Facebook as well) \\"deeply offensive\\", but he also believed the posts were different from those that threaten or incite violence because they were about the use of \\"state force\\". On June 1, hundreds of Facebook employees staged a virtual walk-out from work, in protest. That evening, after a call with Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, three civil rights leaders said, \\"We are disappointed and stunned by Mark's incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up... he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump's call for violence against protesters.\\" On June 2, Zuckerberg stated on an internal call with 25,000 Facebook employees that his review concluded \\"the reference is clearly to aggressive policing ‚Äî maybe excessive policing ‚Äî but it has no history of being read as a dog whistle for vigilante supporters to take justice into their own hands.\\" Thirty-three former employees posted an open letter to Facebook on June 3 disputing that conclusion: \\"President Trump's post on Friday not only threatens violence by the state against its citizens, it also sends a signal to millions who take cues from the President.\\"  Notes  References  Category:1960s in Miami Category:1967 controversies Category:1967 in Florida Category:1968 controversies Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:African-American history in Miami Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Controversies in Florida Category:Killing of George Floyd Category:December 1967 events Category:Donald Trump and social media Category:English words and phrases Category:Facebook criticisms and controversies Category:Law enforcement controversies in the United States Category:May 2020 events in the United States Category:Miami Police Department Category:Police brutality in the United States Category:Political repression in the United States Category:Race-related controversies in the United States Category:Racism in the United States Category:Trump administration controversies Category:Twitter controversies Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1967 Category:White supremacy in North America Category:White supremacy Category:History of racism in Florida Category:Miami-Dade Police Department ","title":"When the looting starts, the shooting starts"},{"id":"64112334","text":"Heinz Eichler (14 November 1927 ‚Äì 12 September 2013) was a German politician who served as the Secretary of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic commonly known as East Germany.  Early life and education  Heinz Eichler was born to a working-class family in Leipzig. He joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) in 1944 at the age of sixteen. He graduated from the University of Leipzig in 1950. In 1960, he also graduated from the Academy of Social Sciences of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow.

Woodard proposes a framework for examining American history and current events based on a view of the country as a federation of eleven nations, each defined by a shared culture established by each nation's founding population. Noting that the original thirteen colonies were established at different times and by different groups with different goals and values, Woodard shows how these colonies both cooperated and competed from their founding. The principles held dear by each colony often conflicted with those of other colonies, and those conflicting agendas shaped the founding and growth of the United States. As the country expanded, the populace that moved into the new territory brought with it the culture of the society from which they came, resulting in nations ‚Äì a group that shares a common culture and origin ‚Äì divorced from legal state and international boundaries. American Nations argues that the contrasts between regional cultures, as opposed to state borders, provide a more useful and accurate explanation of events and movements. The eleven nations *Yankeedom began with the Puritans in New England and spread across upper New York, the northern parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa, into the eastern Dakotas, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Canadian Maritime. *Deep South was settled by former West Indies plantation owners in Charleston, and spread to encompass South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, western Tennessee, and the southeast parts of North Carolina, Arkansas, and Texas. *New Netherland, established by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, is now Greater New York City, as well as the lower Hudson Valley, northern New Jersey, western Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut. *Tidewater was founded by Cavaliers, and consists of Virginia, Maryland, southern Delaware, and northeastern North Carolina. *Greater Appalachia was populated by waves of immigrants that Woodard calls Borderlanders, from the borders of Northern Ireland, northern England, and the Scottish lowlands. Greater Appalachia covers the highlands in the south United States, the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri, eastern Oklahoma, and Texas Hill Country. *Midlands, founded by English Quakers followed by the Pennsylvania Dutch, consists of southeast Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, northern Delaware and Maryland, central Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, northern Missouri, most of Iowa, and the eastern halves of South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, as well has southern Ontario. The border city of Chicago is shared with Yankeedom and St. Louis with Greater Appalachia. *New France began in 1604 with an expedition from France led by Pierre Dugua. It grew to encompass the lower third of Quebec, north and northeast New Brunswick, and southern Louisiana. *El Norte is where the oldest European subculture in the United States is found, from the early Catholic Spanish settlers in the 16th century. Later augmented by Anglo-Americans from Deep South and Greater Appalachia, it includes south and west Texas, southern California and its Imperial Valley, southern Arizona, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, and Baja California. *Far West is the interior of the United States west of the 100th meridian west between El Norte and First Nation. It includes the interiors of California, Oregon, and Washington, much of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alaska, part of Yukon and Northwest Territories, the west halves of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas, as well as Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada. *Left Coast was predominantly colonized by Yankees from New England, with a huge influx from Greater Appalachia and countries around the world when gold was discovered. It encompasses the land between the Pacific Ocean and the Pacific Coast Ranges from Monterey, California to Juneau, Alaska, containing parts of California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. *First Nation, founded by the predominant indigenous peoples in Canada south of the Arctic Circle, consists of much of Yukon, Northwest Territories, Labrador, Nunavut, Greenland, the northern tier of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, northwestern British Columbia, and the northern two-thirds of Quebec. The alliances American Nations contends that, on most matters, two major alliances of nations are commonly opposed to each other: the northern alliance of Yankeedom, the New Netherlands and the Left Coast, and the southern alliance of the Deep South, Greater Appalachia, and Tidewater. The remaining nations ‚Äì Midlands, New France, El Norte, and Far West ‚Äì generally swing individually toward the views of either alliance, depending on the issue. The positions of those \\"swing\\" nations determine shifts in the balance of power in the US. For example, the southern alliance is reliably in favor of foreign wars and the northern alliance is generally opposed. Reception James M. Rubenstein, professor of geography at Miami University, criticizes the generalizations about the cultures, yet says Woodard's \\"fundamental point is sound\\". Writing for the journal The Social Contract, Michael Masters takes issue with some of the book's perspectives on history, particularly Woodard's description of the Bill of Rights being based on the Articles of Capitulation on the Reduction of New Netherland, and contends that American Nations fails to adequately address the vast numbers of later immigrants. A starred review in Kirkus concludes, \\"Woodard offers a fascinating way to parse American (writ large) politics and history in this excellent book.\\" MarketWatch, examining the book in the context of the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election, says \\"Woodard‚Äôs redrawn map is winning fans who see it as providing some fresh insight into what is going on in American politics.\\" The Green Papers observes that while both American Nations and the earlier The Nine Nations of North America by Joel Garreau correctly note that cultures of states are \\"not so easily shoe-horned\\" into the regions to which they are typically assigned and that the influences of these cultures transcend international boundaries into Mexico and Canada, the reality is that Congressional representatives and senators are elected by states. A reviewer for the Portland, Maine Press Herald calls Woodard's arguments compelling and the book well-written and superb. Noting the similarity to The Nine Nations of North America, the reviewer points out that Garreau's framework is more about economical factors where American Nations is about \\"adherence to ideas and approaches to doing things.\\" He questions the absence of southern Florida and the Caribbean, and Hawaii and the Pacific. The Washington Post calls it \\"a compelling and informative attempt to make sense of the regional divides in North America in general and this country in particular\\", noting how American Nations builds on the foundation of David Hackett Fischer's Albion's Seed and addresses immigration and mobility with the argument that new arrivals adapt to the existing cultures. The review, like others, identifies a bias in Yankee Woodard's characterizations of Deep South. The Wall Street Journal compares American Nations to Albion's Seed and The Nine Nations and concludes, \\"Mr. Woodard's approach is breezier than Mr. Fischer's and more historical than Mr. Garreau's, but he has earned a place on the shelf between them\\", yet identifies \\"enough annoying errors to make one wary of its often original analysis\\".

Biography  Fostikov was born in Batalpashinsk (now Cherkessk, Karachay-Cherkessia, Russia). His father was an officer with the Kuban Cossacks. He graduated from the Alexander Military Law Academy in 1907 and the Nikolaev Academy of the General Staff, Russia's senior staff college, in 1917. During World War I he served as a junior officer in the 1st Labinsk Cossack Regiment on the Caucasus Front. Fostikov came again to the Kuban after the October Revolution and joined the White movement at Stavropol. In the summer of 1918 he established the 1st Kuban Cossack Regiment under Andrei Shkuro. He later banded together with the Volunteer Army with his regiment integrated into the 2nd Kuban Cossack Division under Sergei Ulagay. In September 1919 Fostikov was promoted to commander of the Kuban Mounted Brigade and the 1st Kuban Regiment as part of Shkuro's Kuban Corps. In December he was given command of the 2nd Kuban Cossack Division. In February 1920 Fostikov was wounded near Stavropol and he was separated from the Kuban forces. His soldiers conveyed him to Batalpashinsk, where he formed a White partisan group, the People's Army for the Regeneration of Russia in May. His units operated behind enemy lines during the unsuccessful landing of Kuban Cossacks under Ulagay on the Taman Peninsula that summer. He led his forces into the Democratic Republic of Georgia before they were eventually evacuated to Feodosia in Crimea to join the forces of Pyotr Wrangel. Fostikov commanded an independent Kuban Cossack Brigade from September to November, fighting against the Red Army attempting to enter the peninsula across the Syvash wetlands. He was evacuated along with the rest of Wrangel's forces to Turkey. Fostikov spent seven months in camps on Lemnos before in June 1921 departing to Yugoslavia, where he worked as a teacher. He was arrested after the Belgrade Offensive by Soviet forces but was released. He died in a Belgrade hospital in 1966 and is buried at Stara Pazova in Serbia.

Etymology  The etymology of the genus name Crossopetalum derives from the two Ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"fringe\\", and (), meaning \\"leaf of a flower\\". It alludes to the fimbriate petals of the type species (C. rhacoma). The synonym name Myginda is a taxonomic anagram derived from the name of the confamilial genus Gyminda. The latter name is a taxonomic patronym honoring Franz von Mygind (1710 - 1789), a Danish-Austrian court official, who traveled to Barbados, collected plants with herbarium specimens hosted in the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, and was a friend of Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin.

Runaways from Communist Romania Viscreanu is the only footballer who managed to runaway twice from Romania's communist regime, at that time running away from the country being illegal. His first runaway was in Australia during the 1981 World Youth Championship. He played in the first two games from the group stage against Brazil and South Korea and after the end of the second one, a Romanian of Hungarian origin who was settled in Australia asked him if he wants to stay in Australia. In one night, he managed to escape from the hotel and got into a car parked in front of the hotel door. The ones who helped him escape brought him in their home and took care of him by buying him food and clothes. The next day all the Australian newspapers headlined his escape and he was invited every day at a reality show from a TV station which belonged to Rupert Murdoch. However, after ten days he was called with his lawyer at the police station, where he found out that he was deported back to Romania. In 2019, in Barcelona he met with the lawyer that represented him in 1981 and he found out that he was deported because the dictator Nicolae Ceau»ôescu had a secret agreement with Australia in which he allowed Romania to participate at the tournament but in case someone from the team ran away, Australia had to extradite him back to Romania. After he came back to the country, for about seven years he was constantly harassed by Securitate officers who literally followed him everywhere he would go and would sometimes enter his house when he was away. They also threatened him that if they catch him planning to runaway they would throw him in jail, he was not even allowed to leave BacƒÉu. His second runaway was in 1989 while he was playing for Dinamo Bucure»ôti in a friendly tournament held in Madrid, Spain. Together with teammate Marcel Sabou, he snuck out of the hotel and went to the airport. They bought tickets to Frankfurt where Sabou said he had a friend who would help them, but when they arrived they didn't have an entrance visa so they were sent back to Madrid. When they got back at the airport from Madrid, they found out that their visa for Spain was no longer available. A police commissioner from the airport understood their situation and allowed them to stay in the airport for two days and introduced them to some people he knew from Rayo Vallecano. They signed three-year contracts with Rayo, but did not play in the first one because in those times there was a rule that every footballer who ran away from the communist bloc would be suspended for one year before being allowed to play again. Viscreanu and Sabou made an agreement that they would not sign a contract one without the other, but Sabou did not respect this pact as he signed with Real Madrid Castilla without thinking of Viscreanu's situation, a fact that ruined their friendship. When Viscreanu's one year suspension was over, Rayo Vallecano relegated from Primera Divisi√≥n, so he played in 12 matches from the 1990‚Äì91 Segunda Divisi√≥n season, after which he retired at age 29 because of medical problems.

The street runs five blocks between Trinity Place in the west and Hanover Street in the east. Exchange Place was created by 1657 as part of the Castello Plan, the street plan for the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (modern-day Lower Manhattan). It is composed of parts of two colonial Dutch roads and survives largely as it existed in 1660, although it has been renamed multiple times and was extended in 1836. The current name, which dates from 1827, was derived from the New York Stock Exchange's presence near Exchange Place. Several points of interest are located along Exchange Place, including the New York Stock Exchange Building, 20 Exchange Place, and 55 Wall Street. History Exchange Place was created by 1657, as outlined in the Castello Plan, a street map for the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (modern-day Lower Manhattan); the street still survives largely as it existed in 1660. The street incorporates parts of two colonial Dutch roads: Heere Dwars Straet and Tuyn Straet. Heere Dwars Street (literally The Lord's Cross Street) ran two blocks between Broadway and Broad Street. Tuyn Street, named after gardens, ran one block from Broad Street to William Street. In colonial times, the area was swampland; to drain the swamp, a canal was dug from Exchange Place, along which Broad Street was subsequently built. A Dutch Reformed Church was erected at Exchange Place and Broad Street in 1830. Tuyn Street was renamed Church Street in 1695 and Garden Street in 1797. Garden Street was renamed Exchange Place in 1827, after the Merchants Exchange Building at Wall and William Streets was built that year. However, the origin of the name \\"Exchange Place\\" is derived from the presence of the New York Stock Exchange at Broad Street. In 1836, Exchange Place was extended from William Street to Hanover Street. By the 1830s, the demand for commercial space had increased significantly on Exchange Place and surrounding streets. Many residential buildings on the street were subsequently demolished, and commercial buildings were erected in their place. Exchange Place was a center for financial activity; in 1867, it was reported that $1.6 million had been stolen from one of the banks on Exchange Place. The 1939 WPA Guide to New York City stated that Exchange Place, together with Wall and Broad Streets, formed the core of Manhattan's Financial District. Notable buildings Exchange Place contains several landmarks and other structures along its route. 1 Wall Street, a New York City designated landmark, is located on the north side of the street between Broadway and New Street. The New York Stock Exchange Building at 8‚Äì18 Broad Street, a National Historic Landmark and New York City designated landmark, is on the north side of Exchange Place between New and Broad Streets. The Broad Exchange Building is located at the southeast corner of Broad Street and Exchange Place, while the Continental Bank Building is on the southwest corner of that intersection and 15 Broad Street is on the northeast corner. The easternmost block of Exchange Place is taken up by two buildings: 55 Wall Street (a National Register of Historic Places listing and New York City landmark) on the north side and 20 Exchange Place (a New York City landmark) on the south side. In addition, the New York City Subway's Broad Street station, serving the , has entrances at Exchange Place and Broad Street.

The historical descriptions of the St. Joseph's Plantation describes it as a large and sophisticated operation that was worked and maintained by at least 80 enslaved people. The plantation grew and harvested many crops that included 200 acres of ratoon and planted cane, 200 acres of corn intermixed with cane, 80 acres of hammock land, 80 acres of peas and 20 acres of potatoes.United States. Congress. House. Committee on Claims. Joseph M. Hernandez. 28th Congress. 1st Session. H. Rept. 58. The Library of Congress. January 19, 1844. The St. Joseph's Plantation included extensive causeways, roads and bridges. In addition, there were several large canals that were four, five and seven feet wide and seven feet deep that ran from a half to one and a half miles in length. About two million cubic feet of cross-ditching that spanned over 200 acres were two feet wide and two feet deep, and spaced 35 feet from each other, were used for drainage. In addition to the main house, there were many outbuildings that included a large well-finished stone boiling house that was connected with a curing house that measured 67 feet long by 31 feet wide with division walls for molasses cisterns. Several buildings supported sugar production and included a mill house, a large frame building with a steam engine with iron rollers (used to grind sugar cane), a large two-story wood framed corn house and a wood framed pumpkin house. Other building that supported the operation of the plantation included two large cattle sheds, a large fodder house, a blacksmith shop, kitchen and various houses for enslaved workers. There were also several oxen, horses, cattle, hand carts, a variety of trade tools and miscellaneous plantation-related machinery. Military occupation During the Second Seminole War, the Florida Militia commandeered the St. Joseph's plantation and renamed it Camp Brisbane. Troops converted the large two-story main house into a storehouse on its first floor and a hospital on its second floor. The troops also fortified the large two-story main house's perimeter with logs from the plantation's blacksmith shop and two of its log slave houses. St. Joseph's Plantation/Camp Brisbane became the Florida Militia's (second brigade of the second regiment) main supply depot for its operations south of St. Augustine. U.S. Army and militia troops abused the plantation during their occupation by halting all of its operations and pilfering and destroying much of its resources and property.Sprague, J.T. (1848). The Origin, Progress, and Conclusions of the Florida War. New York: D. Appleton &Company.;Strickland, Alice. (1985). Ashes on the Wind. Daytona Beach: Volusia County Historical Commission. After the Florida Militia was defeated by the Seminoles and their allies at the Battle of Dunlawton on January 18, 1836, Brigadier General Hernandez ordered the battered and wounded troops, led by Major Benjamin Putnam, to retreat to Bulowville and wait for additional orders and troop reinforcements. On January 23, 1836, Hernandez was notified that reinforcements were not coming so he ordered Major Putnam to abandon Bulowville and move his troops to St. Joseph's/Camp Brisbane. The hospital at St. Joseph's Plantation/Camp Brisbane was not equipped or staffed to accommodate all the wounded troops. As a result, Major Putnam abandoned St. Joseph's Plantation/Camp Brisbane on January 28, 1836 and move all of his troops and people enslaved at the farm to St. Augustine. That left the St. Joseph's Plantation/Camp Brisbane abandoned and unguarded. Soon afterwards, in 1836, the Seminole Indians and their allies looted the remaining property and burnt most of the remaining buildings to the ground.Knetsch, Joe Dr. Benjamin A.

Rebuilding attempts Joseph Marion Hernandez filed a claim against the United States government for about $100,000 for damages sustained on the St. Joseph's Plantation and other properties during the Second Seminole War. In March 1839, a partial payment of monetary awards for his war claims were approved by the United States Congress. Hernandez received additional payments between 1839 and 1842 that totaled $39,521. In 1844, Hernandez asked Congress to pay the balance of $64,494 but his request was declined. Even though Hernandez recovered some of his wartime losses from the U.S. government, it was not enough to completely rebuild the St. Joseph's Plantation and his other decimated properties. Hernandez managed to yield a considerable crop of sugar and syrup from the St. Joseph's Plantation, but it was not enough income to maintain the plantation. Fate In 1850, Hernandez moved to Cuba and the parts of what remained of the St. Joseph's Plantation were abandoned and eventually eroded away and were pilfered over the following decades. Today, nothing remains above ground of the St. Joseph's Plantation, whose site has been completely redeveloped with modern structures and roadways.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range. The mountain is situated in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Robinson Mountain, to the east-southeast, and Slate Peak is set to the west. Precipitation runoff from Devils Peak drains west into Robinson Creek, and east into Eureka Creek, which are both part of the Methow River drainage basin. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Devils Peak centered with Robinson Mountain behind as seen from Slate Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Sometimes translated as Synodal Way) is a series of conferences of the Catholic Church in Germany to discuss a range of contemporary theological and organizational questions, as well as possible reactions to the abuse crisis. Organization The Synodal Path's supreme body is the Synodal Assembly. It consists of 230 members, made up of the archbishops, bishops and auxiliary bishops, as well as an equal number of lay-members from the Central Committee of German Catholics. This number is further increased by representatives of religious orders or other ecclesial groups. The Synodal Path is further divided into four Synodal Forums that each focus on a particular topic: * Power and Separation of Powers in the Church - Joint Participation and Involvement in the Mission * Life in succeeding relationships - Living Love in Sexuality and Partnership * Priestly Existence Today * Women in Ministries and Offices in the Church Meetings The Synodal Path commenced on 1 December 2019 and was originally planned as four principal meetings of the Synodal Assembly in Frankfurt am Main with the time in between used for preparations. The first meeting took place from 30 January to 1 February 2020. The following meeting was scheduled 3 September to 5 September 2020 but was substituted by a distributed regional conference on 4 September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consecutive meetings are planned for 4 to 6 February 2021, 31 September to 2 October 2021 and 3 to 5 February 2022. Due to construction works in the Frankfurt Cathedral the initial meeting could not convene there as originally planned and had to evade to a former monastery which usually serves as a Protestant convention center. Reception The Synodal Path has drawn a wide range of criticism both domestically and internationally. A common topic is a perceived lack of fidelity to the established doctrines of the Catholic Church, e.g. due to the refusal of the Synodal Assembly to rule out decisions that run counter to Catholic doctrines. Another common criticism concerns over the legitimacy of the organizational form chosen as the Synodal Path is not using an established organisational form sanctioned by canon law. On 29 June 2019 Pope Francis wrote a letter \\"To the Pilgrim People of God in Germany\\". The letter supported synodal deliberations but also called for a focus of evangelization over pure reorganization. Consecutive attempts by some German bishops to redirect the Synodal Path towards \\"evangelization\\" were declined. In early September 2019 Cardinal Ouellet of the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops sent a letter to the German Bishops' Conference to warn them that the organizational structure chosen by the Synodal Path was invalid and could not make binding decisions about some of its key topics. On 21 September 2019, prior to the start of the Synodal Path, Professor Marianne Schlosser of the University of Vienna and a member of the International Theological Commission resigned from her planned role in the Synodal Forum \\"Women in Ministries and Offices in the Church\\" citing the forum's \\"fixation on ordination\\" of women On 28 May 2020 Auxiliary Bishop Dominikus Schwaderlapp of the Archdiocese of Cologne resigned from his position in the Synodal Forum \\"Life in Successful Relationships\\" in protest to the forum's view on sexual morality which he claimed contradicted the Catholic Church's view as stated in Humanae vitae Pior to the Regional Conferences on 4 September 2020, Bishop Vorderholzer of Regensburg criticized the conference's working papers in an open letter, dated 2 September. Points criticized included the creation of the working papers which he said deviated from the agreed upon procedure, leaving the participants no room for comment prior to the conference, as well as the papers' one-sided biblical theology, despite earlier agreements to leave biblical theology for later meetings.

It has been held by the Guildhall Art Gallery since 1893. A second version, c.1914, is held by Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum. The painting measures . It depicts Clytemnestra, mythical daughter of the Spartan queen Leda and sister of Helen of Troy, who herself became queen of ancient Mycenae. In an episode recounted in the tragic play Agamemnon by Aeschylus, the stern-faced queen is shown at the palace of Argos, shortly after she has killed her husband Agamemnon in revenge for his sacrifice of their youngest daughter Iphigenia to secure favourable winds for the journey home at the end of the siege of Troy. Agamemnon returned home with the captured Trojan princess Cassandra, but an enraged Clytemnestra murdered them both (in some accounts she is assisted by their son Orestes, and in others Agamemnon is killed by her lover Aegisthus). Clytemnestra is standing in a doorway, holding back a curtain with one hand, and resting her other hand on the very long handle of a double-headed axe, which is dripping blood onto the floor. Her clothes are also spattered with blood, while a body can be dimly seen in the gloomy room beyond. Collier was influenced by Lawrence Alma- Tadema, who encouraged Collier to use archaeological discoveries to give his paintings greater historical accuracy. Details of the painting are based on discoveries from excavations of archaeological sites in Greece and of the site of Troy in Turkey. Clytemnestra is wearing a delicate gold headpiece, based on the small \\"Helen of Troy\\" diadem, part of the so-called Treasure of Priam discovered by Heinrich Schliemann in the 1870s. The pattern traced on the axehead is taken from a stone cylinder also from Troy. Her patterned clothes and the architecture of the doorway are based on other archaeological examples, and the column beside the doorway in the painting resembles one from the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae (but with its capital incorrectly positioned at the base of the column rather than its top, perhaps based on a similarly inverted contemporaneous display of the column at the British Museum, later corrected). The somewhat androgynous features of Clytemnestra may be based on a production of the Aeschylus play Agamemnon at Balliol College, Oxford in 1880, in which a male student Frank Benson acted the part of Clytemnestra. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1882, accompanied by a line from Aeschylus's play: \\"Him twice I smote - twice groaning prone he fell, / With limbs relaxed; then, prostrate where he lay, / Him with third blow I dowered, votive gift / To Hades, guardian of the dead below.\\" It was presented to the Guildhall Art Gallery in 1893 by Mrs Mary Harrison. File:Column of treasury of Atreus.jpgReconstruction of a column from the Treasury of Atreus, at the British Museum File:John-collier-clytemnestra.jpgVersion in Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum, c.1914 Around 1914, Collier painted a second version of the scene, correcting many of the details of the Mycenaean period. The second painting depicts a bare-breasted Clytemnestra with a bloody Mycenaean sword. Many details are different, including the decoration of the floor, and doorway. Clytemnestra wears a long skirt based on Minoan discoveries, replacing the robe in the 1882 version, and the column from the Treasury of Atreus has been put up the right way. It measures , and is held by Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum.

Yolette was born and raised in La Fossette, Cap-Haitien. After her father's death in 1930, at the age of 15, her mother registered her at a boarding school of Mrs. Maud Turien at Port-au- Prince. On August 25, 1935, at a party for Quartier Morin, she met an officer named Paul Eugene Magloire. They were married less than a year later on April 18, 1936. On January 13, 1937, she gave birth to their only son Raymond Magloire at Cap-Haitien, Haiti. On June 29, 1938, she gave birth to the couple's first daughter, Elsie Magloire.

By the end of 1931, the union had 29,618 members. In 1933, the union was banned by the Nazis, but it continued to organise underground, especially in Frankfurt.

She was born in 1820, to a government official and his wife, St. Magdalene Han Yong-i, who was martyred on December 29, 1839. Agatha was married at a young age, about 12 or 13 years old, but her husband was too poor to care for her, so she lived with her relatives. Agatha worked as a housekeeper for Chinese priest Yu Pang-che Pacificus during his visit to Korea; on her request, he had her marriage annulled \\"so that she could be a virgin\\". Yu returned to China after rumors spread about their relationship, and although they subsided, she \\"was repentant and determined to make up for it by offering herself as a martyr to God\\". When Agatha was 21, she was arrested with her mother and two young Catholic women, St. Agatha Yi Kyong-i and a servant girl; she and her mother were separated and the women were placed under house arrest in Seoul, under the surveillance of a guard. An \\"apostate Christian\\" offered Agatha freedom if she went away with him and threatened her if she refused; when she rejected him, the guards became sympathetic towards her and helped all three women escape. The servant girl, however, was re-captured, and told her captors where the other women were hiding; they were re-arrested and the guards who helped them escape were punished by their superiors. Both women refused to deny their faith despite \\"many severe tortures\\"; Agatha was brutally beaten on her legs in court. She visited her mother one last time in prison before her mother's execution. Agatha was also able to send a letter, which was \\"full of fervent affection and obedience to God's Will\\", to a friend. Agatha was beheaded a month later, on January 31, 1840, in Danggogae in what is now the Yongsan district of Seoul, with five other Catholics. The Korean bishops said of Agatha: \\"This young Korean woman offered God more tears and more fragrant perfume than Mary Magdalene of Jesus' time\\". St. Agatha was part of the persecution of Catholics in Korea that took place over the course of 100 years. Up to 10,000 Catholics were martyred for their faith because they were perceived as a threat to local Confucian ideals, over five main waves of persecution. She was executed during \\"the infamous 1839‚Äì1840 Gihae Persecution\\", with a group of ten prisoners, including St. Mary Yi Seong-rye. Nine of the Danggogae martyrs, including St. Agatha, were canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1984, when he canonized 103 martyrs and French missionaries killed during the waves of persecutions in Korea. There is a shrine dedicated to the martyrs at Danggogae, which honors the third-highest number of martyred saints in Korea.

ASAP forms a safety team between the FAA, the certificate holder (airline/operator), employee, and the operator's employee labor organization. Safety improvement occurs without discipline, encouraging further and continued hazard reporting. FAA guidance The US Department of Transportation FAA produces the Advisory Circular 120-66C directing how to implement the ASAP program at the certificate holder's company.

Contents The Manual of Aurania is an unlicensed Dungeons & Dragons supplement of over 50 new monsters, nine dragons, character classes, and tables for random reincarnation. The new character classes included: * Beorning * Sidhe * Samurai * Basadae * Leprechaun * Shape-Shifter * Cleric of Mitra * Cleric of Asgard (either Thor or Odin) The new monsters included seven new types of giants, five trolls, nine types of undead, eight dragons, six demons, and 22 miscellaneous creatures. Publication history In 1974, when TSR published Dungeons & Dragons, one of the earliest adopters was Aero Hobbies, a games store in Santa Monica, California owned by Gary Switzer. A large D&D; group quickly formed and played regularly, developing a world called \\"Aurania\\", and several new variant rules and monsters. Someone in the group came up with the idea for a new character class based on lock-picking skills. One of the players, Daniel Wagner, later recalled, \\"One group had a dwarf who wanted to try picking locks with his dagger, so I had the idea for a Burglar class, which we drew up like a Magic user but with skills (like Lock picking) instead of spells. The consensus was to call the class 'Thief'.\\" Wanting to share this news, store owner Switzer called Gary Gygax at TSR and described the thief class. Gygax subsequently developed the fourth official character class for D&D; called the \\"thief\\", and published an early version in the independent games zine Great Plains Game Players Newsletter, crediting \\"Gary Schweitzer\\" of \\"sunny California\\" for the idea. Back at Aero Hobbies, news of the article did not travel as far as Santa Monica, and Switzer did not tell the group he had shared the group's idea with Gygax, so when the new Thief class appeared in the first D&D; supplement, Greyhawk, the group assumed Gygax had stolen their idea. Their response was to write The Manual of Aurania, a collection of all of the new rules and monsters their group had developed. In the introduction, the authors claimed that several of their original concepts had been \\"stolen outright\\", and the purpose of the book was \\"to prevent this from happening again\\". Manual of Aurania was written by Hugh K. Singh, D. Daniel Wagner, and Larry E. Stehle, with artwork by Troy Hughes and Aimee Karklyn. The Aero Hobbies group printed 200 copies of the 30-page book in 1977; a second printing of 1,000 copies, with typos corrected, was published by International Gamers Association in 1978. The original developer of the Thief class, Daniel Wagner, later related that when he met Gary Gygax at a convention, Gygax contended that the unlicensed Manual of Aurania was intellectual property theft, and threatened to sue. When Wagner reminded him of the origin of the Thief class, Gygax relented, saying, \\"One good steal deserves another.\\" Shannon Appelcline noted how the International Gamers Association had a close connection with Grimoire Games and through its short- lived partnership was doing distribution for them out of Long Beach, and that \\"Through this connection, Grimoire ended up associated with two other Californian \\"generic FRP\\" supplements that were also being distributed by IGA: The Manual of Aurania (1977, 1978) and Wizard's Aide (1977).\\" The Aero Hobbies group finished a second book, Libram of Aurania, but it was never published. Reception In the December 1978‚ÄìJanuary 1979 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #10), Don Turnbull was not taken with the new character classes, saying, \\"it seems to me that most, if not all these new creations are stronger than they should be, with no corresponding increase in weak points.\\" Likewise he was not enthusiastic about the variant reincarnation rules, pointing out that dead characters had the same chance of returning as either a powerful gold dragon or as a lowly gnome. But he was impressed by the sixty new monsters presented, commenting, \\"It is in this section that I think most readers will find their main interest lies.\\" He concluded \\"On the whole, it's not a bad booklet and a reasonable buy for the money\\" and gave the book a rating of 4 out of 10.

The causes of the protest stemmed from the 2019 bankruptcy of Blackjewel Coal, a coal mining company that operated a mine in the county. Following the company's bankruptcy, former coal miners did not receive payment for several weeks of work, leading to many miners protesting by blocking a coal train on tracks in the county. The protest lasted from July 30 to September 28, with litigation continuing in bankruptcy courts.  Background  On July 1, 2019, Blackjewel Coal filed for bankruptcy, leading to the abrupt firing of about 1,700 miners in Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Following this, many of the affected workers reported bounced paychecks and being unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Shortly thereafter, a miner in Wyoming filed a class-action lawsuit against Blackjewel, arguing that they violated workers rights under the WARN Act.  Railroad occupation  On July 29, Blackjewel was scheduled to move $1 million worth of coal out of a mine in Harlan County, Kentucky via a CSX Railroad track. Before the train left the county, five former miners occupied a section of the track, not allowing the train to proceed. Following this, security guards for the company called police, and afterwards the protestors moved to another location on the tracks, still blocking the train's movements. Additional people joined the protest, with over 100 people occupying the tracks during the protest. Several days after the occupation began, protestors agreed to allow several unloaded cars pass, but continued to hold the loaded coal train stationary. On August 1, former Kentucky Attorney General Greg Stumbo visited the protestors, criticizing Blackjewel and the Kentucky Labor Department for failing to hold the company accountable for workers rights violations. The next day, 2020 Democratic Party Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders voiced his support for the protestors and sent pizzas to the protestors. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin and Senate candidate Amy McGrath also voiced their support for the protestors, along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. In August, the Richard and Leslie Gilliam Foundation donated over $1 million to fired miners in Harlan County and other areas that were affected. On September 28, following almost 2 months of occupying the railroad, the mayor of Cumberland, Kentucky, where many of the protestors lived, announced an end to the protest. Many of the fired miners had found employment elsewhere, and settlement talks were underway with the company and fired workers.  Aftermath  In October, as part of the company's bankruptcy settlement, Blackjewel awarded $5.47 million to fired miners, including those in Harlan County. A similar train blockade occurred in January 2020 in Pike County, Kentucky. On January 13, miners for Quest Energy occupied a railroad track near Kemper, Kentucky and blocked a 120-car coal train from leaving, claiming that the company failed to pay them wages for three weeks. The protest ended on January 15, with the protesting miners receiving pay.

It ended with the death of Eli Hall, a Jamaican gangster wanted by police. Background Eli Hall, born in Jamaica, was a 32-year-old gangster and former nightclub doorman. In the 1990s, he served a series of prison sentences for violence, possession of controlled drugs, and possession of firearms and other weapons. In 2002, Hall was wanted by police in connection with two incidents in which he was believed to have to have fired on police officers. Siege On Boxing Day, 26 December 2002, the Metropolitan Police sent a civilian contractor to remove a vehicle belonging to Eli Hall for forensic tests. The contractor was accompanied by armed police officers in case Hall was encountered. Unknown to the police, the car was parked outside Hall's residence on Marvin Street, near the junction with Graham Road. Hall spotted the contractor and threatened them from a window in his flat, brandishing a firearm, before firing at the police officers who confronted him. During the siege, the police discovered that a second man was in the flat, being held hostage by Hall. The hostage escaped 11 days into the siege. Throughout the incident, residents in the affected street and immediately surrounding roads were confined to their homes for their own safety, except some vulnerable people who were evacuated. Some residents criticised the police's cautious approach, believing that the police should have taken direct action at an earlier stage to force a resolution. Commander Bob Quick defended the approach, pointing out that the hostage was release unharmed and that the only casualty was Hall, who killed himself. Quick was supported by several academics and the local MP, Diane Abbott. On 9 January 2003, at around 09:15, Hall fired at police positions and one officer returned fire with a single shot, wounding Hall. Hall then set fire to the flat and shot himself in the head. Police fired baton rounds at the building's windows to allow access for fire hoses. Hall was last seen at 10:50 After dark, armed police officers climbed through a window and discovered Hall's burnt body. The incident has been described as Britain's longest siege. Impact The siege was the first police operation of its kind in London for over twenty years following the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege, and has been compared to two other major sieges in London, the Spaghetti House siege and the Balcombe Street siege, both in 1975. In April and May 2003, the Tristan Bates Theatre in the West End hosted Come Out Eli, a play based on the events of the siege and local residents' experiences.

Gozzard was raised in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, where he apprenticed as a carpenter-joiner and gradually earned his journeyman‚Äôs papers in boat building, masonry and carpentry. Gozzard served in the Royal Air Force for a number of years as an airframe mechanic. On leaving the RAF in 1959 Gozzard came to Ontario and worked in the construction business in London, Ontario, where he designed and supervised the construction of homes and subdivisions. In his spare time he built and sailed a much modified Thunderbird. Giving in to an urge to sail full time, Gozzard and his wife, Jan, and their two young sons made the Caribbean their home for two full years. 45' Trimaran Manta In the Caribbean the Gozzard and family experienced multihull sailing for the first time, enjoying the speed combined with space and shoal draft. When the family moved back to Canada, Gozzard designed and built the trimaran, Manta in London, Ontario. In the early part of 1970 Gozzard relocated to the Village of Bayfield, Ontario. One of the main reasons for residing in Bayfield was to carry out testing on Manta. Gozzard had built this trimaran for the sole purpose of returning to the Bahamas aboard a boat with good living space for a family of four and a tutor. A quote from the Gozzard Yachts website: > Once a few people saw the rather unique trimaran (remember this is 1970 and > multihull were taboo), Ted‚Äôs skills as a boat builder were apparent and all > of a sudden ‚Äúboats‚Äù became a large part of our lives.

Gary eventually became one of the > original partners and if anyone deserves credit for helping start BBY it is > Gary Ferguson. In 1970 Gozzard became involved with designing and building a schooner named Twilight which was built on the waterfront in Bayfield. The Twilight was advertised, and many inquiries came. One individual who inquired wanted to build a smaller version of the Twilight. This smaller version, at , later to be called the Bayfield 25, was the start of the Bayfield line of yachts. Bayfield Boat Yard Bayfield 25 Gozzard continued designing and building cruising yachts, in the early days also repairing canoes, building fibreglass cowlings for snowmobiles and the odd ‚ÄúOK‚Äù Dinghy. In 1970 Gozzard founded Bayfield Boat Yard Ltd. (BBY) in Bayfield, Ontario. The Bayfield 23/25 was the first model produced. Gozzard designed by carving a wooden hull model, believing that while computers are capable of a great deal, they can‚Äôt predict exactly how a hull will perform once built. Gozzard felt a trained eye had a better chance of producing a beautiful boat. Gozzard also offered to modify any aspect of a Bayfield boat for an existing owner as part of his design services, at no charge.(Facts courtesy of the Bayfield Breezes newsletter, Spring 1977) North Castle Marine Ltd. Gozzard sold his interest in Bayfield in July of 1981 and shortly thereafter, in February of 1982, North Castle Marine Ltd./Gozzard Yachts in Goderich, Ontario was founded. At North Castle Marine Ltd/Gozzard Yachts, the Pilgrim 40 motor yacht was designed and built, with the line of sailing yachts now known as Gozzard Yachts soon following. Gozzard Yachts went on to produce sailboats in 31', 36', 37', 41' and 44' designs. In 1983 Gozzard's two sons joined the company. Mike, the eldest, plays an active role in all aspects of the company as the production manager. Wes began as the Company's upholsterer and now commissions and delivers boats.

It contains elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate. It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth), headache, fatigue and irregular vaginal bleeding.  Medical uses  Fibroids are benign (non-cancerous) muscle tumors of the uterus that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, bowel or bladder problems and infertility. Some women may not experience any symptoms, but many do, including heavy bleeding with periods. Fibroids can occur at any age but are most common in women 35 to 49 years of age. They typically resolve after menopause but are a leading reason for hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) in the United States when they cause severe symptoms. Elagolix/estradiol/norethindrone acetate is indicated for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women.  Adverse effects  Elagolix/estradiol/norethindrone acetate may cause bone loss over time, and the loss in some women may not be completely recovered after stopping treatment. Because bone loss may increase the risk for fractures, women should not take elagolix/estradiol/norethindrone acetate for more than 24 months. The drug label for the combination includes a boxed warning about the risk of vascular events (strokes) and thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders (blood clots), especially in women at increased risk for these events.  History  Elagolix/estradiol/norethindrone acetate was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020. The efficacy of elagolix/estradiol/norethindrone acetate was established in two clinical trials in which a total of 591 premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding received the drug or placebo for six months. Heavy menstrual bleeding at baseline was defined as having at least two menstrual cycles with greater than 80 mL (about a third of a cup) of menstrual blood loss (MBL). The primary endpoint was the proportion of women who achieved MBL volume less than 80 mL at the final month and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from the start of the study (baseline) to the final month. In the first study, 68.5% of participants who received elagolix/estradiol/norethindrone acetate achieved this endpoint (compared to 8.7% of participants who received placebo). In the second study, 76.5% of participants who received elagolix/estradiol/norethindrone acetate achieved this endpoint (compared to 10.5% of participants who received placebo). The approval of Oriahnn was granted to AbbVie Inc.

Description  The gate originally dates back to around 1126 when the Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf built the first walls of the city, but it has been modified since this time. It was named after Aghmat, the early capital of the Almoravids before Marrakesh, which lay in this direction (i.e. to the south/southeast). The gate may have also been called Bab Yintan, though this is uncertain and this name may have referred to another nearby gate which has since disappeared. Like other Almoravid gates of the city, it has been significantly modified since its initial construction. Originally, it most likely consisted of a bent passage which effected a full 180-degree turn, forming a symmetrical structure around the axis of the wall: one entered from the west through a bastion on the outer side of the city wall, passing through a roofed vestibule, then exited westwards from the bastion on the inner side of the wall, passing through an open-air court. In a much later period a walled courtyard with a very different construction style was added on the outer end of the gate, forcing traffic to effect one more 180-degree turn (though in recent times the northern wall of this courtyard has been knocked down to allow a more direct passage). A staircase in the northeastern corner of the gatehouse leads to the roof. A major cemetery, the Bab Aghmat Cemetery, occupies a wide area just outside the gate and is also flanked to the west by the Jewish cemetery of the city's Mellah. Also near the gate and the cemetery is the Mausoleum of Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali, one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh.

He is considered one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh, and one of the prefecture divisions of Marrakesh is named after him.  Biography  Yusuf ibn 'Ali was born in Marrakesh to a family of Yemeni origin and lived in the city his whole life. He studied under Sheikh Abu 'Usfur. He was afflicted at a young age with leprosy, for which he was allegedly banished from his family and from living in the city. He took up residence in a nearby cave or in a hollow that he dug himself, in the lepers' quarter outside the southern city gate of Bab Aghmat. Despite his ill health, he lived longer than anyone expected and many began to believe he possessed powers to resist hunger and disease. Locals came to visit him in his cave seeking guidance, and he came to be known also as Mul al-Ghar (meaning roughly \\"Man of the Cave\\"). He died in 1196 CE and was buried in or near the cave where he lived.  Legacy  Yusuf ibn 'Ali's reputation grew over time and he became on of the most celebrated of the many awliya (\\"saints\\") of his native city. In the 16th century the Saadian sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib built a mausoleum and zawiya over the cave where he was buried. The sultan's reasons for this are unclear but may have been a conciliatory gesture over his displacement of the leprous population from Bab Aghmat to Bab Doukkala. Later on, he was counted among the \\"Seven Saints\\" of Marrakesh and his tomb became the first stop in a yearly pilgrimage, or ziyara (), instituted by the Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma'il in the late 17th and early 18th century. Today, the neighbourhood and suburb around the mausoleum is part of the local prefecture of Sidi Youssef Ben Ali, named after the saint.

Diameter 18.8 cm.Canby, # 22 Side view of the same bowl ware is a type of Persian pottery developed in Kashan, Iran, in the decades leading up to the Mongol invasion of Persia in 1219, after which production ceased.Komaroff, 4; Michelsen and Olafsdotter, 76; Fitzwilliam Museum: \\"Mina‚Äôi, meaning ‚Äòenamelled‚Äô ware, is one of the glories of Islamic ceramics, and was a speciality of the renowned ceramics centre of Kashan in Iran during the decades of the late 12th and early 13th centuries preceding the Mongol invasions\\". Grube mentions a bowl in the Victoria and Albert Museum dated 1242, but this is not mentioned by later writers. It has been described as \\"probably the most luxurious of all types of ceramic ware produced in the eastern Islamic lands during the medieval period\\".Yale, 175 The ceramic body of white-ish fritware or stonepaste is fully decorated with detailed paintings using several colours, usually including figures.Yale, 175 It is significant as the first pottery to use overglaze enamels,Needham, 618; Watson (2012), 326; Watson (1985), 24; Gulbenkian, 54 painted over the ceramic glaze fixed by a main glost firing; after painting the wares were given a second firing at a lower temperature. \\"\\" (), a term only used for these wares much later, means \\"enamelled\\" in the Persian language.Suleman, 144 The technique is also known as haft-rang, \\"seven colours\\" in Persian. This was the term used by the near-contemporary writer Abu al-Qasim Kasani, who had a pottery background.Persian Tiles, p.3, 1993, by Metropolitan Museum of Art, Stefano Carboni, Tomoko Masuya; Morgan; Abu al- Qasim Kasani's work is dated 1301, and he says that the mina'i technique was not produced in his time. He himself seems to have moved to more genteel occupations around the Ilkhanid court. This technique much later became the standard method of decorating the best European and Chinese porcelain, though it is not clear that there was a connection between this and the earlier Persian use of the technique. As in other periods and regions when overglaze enamels were used, the purpose of the technique was to expand the range of colours available to painters beyond the very limited group that could withstand the temperature required for the main firing of the body and glaze,Yale, 175 which in the case of these wares was about 950 ¬∞C.Caiger- Smith, 57 The period also introduced underglaze decoration to Persian pottery, around 1200,Watson (2012), 326 and later mina'i pieces often combine both underglaze and overglaze decoration; the former may also be described as inglaze. Most pieces are dated imprecisely as, for example, \\"late 12th or early 13th century\\", but the few inscribed dates begin in the 1170s and end in 1219. Gilded pieces are often dated to around or after 1200. It is assumed that the style and subjects in the painting of mina'i ware were drawn from contemporary Persian manuscript painting and wall painting. It is known these existed, but no illustrated manuscripts or murals from the period before the Mongol conquest have survived, leaving the painting on the pottery as the best evidence of that style.Suleman, 144; Grube Most pieces are bowls, cups, and a range of pouring vessels: ewers, jars, and jugs, only a handful very large. There are some pieces considered to be begging bowls, or using the shape associated with that function. Tiles are rare, and were perhaps designed as centrepieces surrounded by other materials, rather than placed in groups.Canby, #s 19, 20 tiles found in situ by archaeologists at Konya in modern Turkey were probably made there by itinerant Persian artists.Canby, 82‚Äì83, 315, note 12 on #20 Sherds of mina'i ware have been excavated from \\"most urban sites in Iran and Central Asia\\" occupied during the period,Canby, 318, note 6 on #37 although most writers believe that nearly all production was in Kashan.Watson (2012), 329; Yale, 177‚Äì178 Wares Large bowl with battle scene, Freer Gallery of Art Black and cobalt blue may be in underglaze, with the wider range of colours in overglaze. As well as the usual white glaze, a coloured turquoise glaze is used in some pieces, giving a background to the overglaze painting. The outlines of the designs were done in black, with thin brushed lines.Osborne, 144 Some mina'i pieces, usually thought to be from the later part of the period, use gilding, sometimes on patterns on the body that are raised up (probably using slip). \\"Faceted Basin, Mina'i (\\"enameled\\") ware, early 13th century\\", with Catalogue entry from Linda Komaroff. The Robert Lehman Collection. Decorative Arts, Volume XV. Wolfram Koeppe, et al. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in association with Princeton University Press, 2012, p. 355. A few pieces combine lustre and mina'i painting in different zones.Yale, 175; one illustrated below; another example A small proportion (smaller than for lustreware) of pieces are signed and dated. Watson records ten such pieces, signed by three potters, with dates from 1178 to 1219. For Kashan lustreware the equivalent numbers are \\"over ninety\\" pieces, \\"perhaps six\\" potters, and dates from 1178 and 1226; there are then no dated pieces until 1261, suggesting the long-lasting disruption of the Mongol invasion. (2012), 328 That the two techniques might be produced by the same workshop is demonstrated by the Persian potter from this period with the most signed pieces, Ab≈´ Zayd ibn Mu·∏•ammad ibn Abƒ´ Zayd from Kashan, with 15 pieces. The earliest date on these is 1186, on a mina'i bowl, but most pieces are lustreware, where dates extend to 1219. \\"Abu Zayd.\\" In Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online, (accessed June 2, 2020; subscription required). Under the Mongol Ilkhanids, overglaze painting continued in a rare new style called lajvardina wares, but these featured patterns rather than figures, with deep underglaze blue and gold leaf fixed in a second firing. The Persian name refers to lapis lazuli, though the usual cobalt blue was used.Encyclopaedia Iranica, \\"Il-Khanids iv; Ceramics\\"; \\"Covered Jar (Albarello)\\" Metropolitan Museum (see catalogue entry); Watson (2012), 336; \\"Three Tiles with 'Lajvardina' Glaze\\", Metropolitan Museum; Osborne, 144 The study of mina'i ware is complicated by a good deal of excessive restoration and embellishment by dealers after the pieces attracted the attention of collectors, mostly in the West, from the late 19th century onwards.Watson (2012), 336, note 43; Michelsen and Olafsdotter, 66‚Äì69 For example, the catalogue entry for a bowl in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, from the Robert Lehman collection, records that \\"Extensive restoration has interfered with the inscription in certain areas, and nearly every part of the interior decoration has been subjected to heavy overpainting\\".Catalogue entry from Linda Komaroff, in The Robert Lehman Collection. Decorative Arts, Volume XV. Wolfram Koeppe, et al. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in association with Princeton University Press, 2012, p. 356. The outside of this lobed bowl is illustrated here. Iconography Beaker illustrating the story of Bijan and Manijeh from the Shahnama, Freer Gallery of Art.Yale, 175‚Äì176; Michelsen and Olafsdotter, 72‚Äì76; other side There are a few pieces with entirely abstract or geometric patterns or designs, but in the great majority of pieces there are figures, usually a number of small ones. Images of enthroned rulers, flanked by attendants, are common, as are figures of riders, who are often engaged in princely pursuits such as hunting and falconry. The \\"inscrutable rulers were probably never meant to represent particular rulers or their consorts\\", any more than the loving couples.Caiger-Smith, 73 Similar motifs abound in other media; it is not clear to what extent they reflected the actual lifestyle of the owners or users of pieces; probably these \\"may indicate a general middle- class aspiration or identification\\" with the princely lifestyle.Watson (2012), 328 quoted; Yale, 175; Canby, 72‚Äì73, #37, #71 Peacocks may accompany princes, and there are often numbers of the Islamic version of the sphinx, especially around the outer border of flat open shapes. Scenes and figures from the Persian literary classics can be seen. The outside of raised bowls is usually not painted with images, although some have relatively simple floral or abstract decoration, but inscriptions of text running round the piece are common.Yale, 175; Canby, 72‚Äì73, #37 Many of these are from standard works of Persian poetry, possibly taken from anthologies that would have been available to the potters.Canby, 318, note 5 on #39 A well-known low bowl in the Freer Gallery of Art (reconstructed from fragments) is exceptional, both in its size of 47.8 cm across, and in its design; it is the largest known plate in the mina'i technique.Holod, 195 There are a very large number of figures, all at the small size typical of other, smaller, pieces. They are engaged in a battle, probably a specific event of the period when \\"an Assassin stronghold was attacked by a petty Iranian prince and his troops\\". The eight principal figures on the victorious side are named in inscriptions next to them,Holod, 196 with Turkish names, and a siege engine and an elephant appear in the scene.Holod, throughout; Yale, 175 quoted This piece may well follow a depiction in a wall painting or other medium,Holod, 209; Grube as may a \\"celebrated\\" beaker, now also in the Freer, which is the fullest example of an iconographic scheme taken from the Persian literary classics, in this case the Shahnameh. Here a whole story is told in a number of scenes in three registers running round the cup.Michelsen and Olafsdotter, 72‚Äì76, 72 quoted Inside of the same bowl Context ware began to be made when Persia was in theory part of the Seljuk Empire, whose ruling dynasty and top elite were ethnically Turkish. But Persia was ruled by the Khwarazmian dynasty, initially as vassals of the Seljuk, until in 1190 they severed these ties and ruled independently until the devastating Mongol conquest beginning in 1219. The fifty years from 1150 saw great developments in Iranian ceramics. Firstly the fritware body and the glazes used on it were greatly improved, which allowed thinner walls and some of the translucency of Chinese porcelain, which was already imported into Persia, and represented the main competition for local fine wares. This \\"white ware\\" body was used for a variety of styles of decoration, all showing great advances in sophistication. Apart from ware, the most luxurious was lustreware, which also required a light second firing; the earliest dated Persian piece is from 1179. The main colour of lustre paint used was gold; this needs to be distinguished from the overglaze application of gold leaf found in many later mina'i pieces.Osborne, 144‚Äì145; Caiger-Smith, 57‚Äì65; (2012), 325‚Äì326 The \\"white ware\\" body was, however, not able to match Chinese porcelain in strength, and though historians praise the delicacy and lightness of and lustred pieces, they are dubious about the practicality of these expensive wares, because of their fragility. Ceramics were not grave goods in Islamic societies, and almost all the survivals that have come down to us were broken, and probably mostly discarded after breakage. The majority of find sites are unrecorded; some pieces were buried unbroken, perhaps to hide them from looters.Savage, 86‚Äì87; Caiger-Smith, 65‚Äì66; Michelsen and Olafsdotter, throughout, especially 76‚Äì86, give an account of a technical examination by various methods of one important piece, made up of many fragments. However, there are also modern forgeries, and Michelsen and Olafsdotter note that \\"one must now be rather suspicious of any piece of mina'i, especially those that appear to be whole and unscathed\\".Michelsen and Olafsdotter, 69, note 6 Their extended technical analysis of a large and well-known dish now in the Museum of Islamic Art, Doha, Qatar, finds that much of the dish is made up of fragments originally from elsewhere (quite possibly also medieval) that have been reshaped to fit the dish, and then painted to match the decorative scheme.Michelsen and Olafsdotter, 76‚Äì86 Though luxurious considered as pottery, the new Persian lustre and mina'i wares may have represented a cost- saving alternative for vessels using precious metals, either in solid form or as inlays on brass or bronze. As early as 1100 the economy of the Seljuk empire was weakening and silver in short supply.Caiger-Smith, 59 Lustreware was not a new technique; it had been used in the Arabic-speaking world for some centuries,Caiger-Smith, 20‚Äì55 but was new to Persia. Its spread there has been connected to a flight of potters from Fustat (Cairo) during the turbulent collapse of Fatimid Egypt around 1160. Since the shapes in Persian lustreware are traditional local ones, it is likely the refugee artisans were mostly pottery painters rather than potters. Lustreware painting styles can be connected to earlier ones in Arabic-speaking lands in a way that is not possible for mina'i ware, whose style, and possibly artists, are normally taken to be drawn from manuscript painting.Caiger-Smith, 57‚Äì59 It is even more clear to scholars that lustreware production was concentrated in Kashan than it is for mina'i ware.Caiger-Smith, 57‚Äì59; Yale, 178; Watson (2012), 328‚Äì329 The mina'i style was soon being copied in other parts of the Seljuk empire, especially Syria. But the makers did not know the secrets of the overglaze technique and used underglaze painting instead.Pitcher in the National Museum of Damascus, Discover Islamic art The secrets of lustreware at least may have been held by a small number of families in Kashan.Caiger-Smith, 59 The later Persian mƒ´nƒÅkƒÅrƒ´ style was and is enamel on a metal base, practiced from the 18th century to the present., Vol. XIV, Fasc. 1, pp.48‚Äì55 File:The Gulbenkian Museum (28595000138) (cropped).jpgBowl with ruler and sphinxes File:Bowl w. enthroned figure & attendants, Mina'i ware, Central Iran, Seljuk period, late 12th or early 13th century, earthenware with polychrome enamels and gold over white glaze - Cincinnati Art Museum - DSC04021.JPGEnthroned figure flanked by attendants.Canby, # 27 File:Bowl MET 57.36.14front.jpegBahram Gur hunting with Azadeh; 3 5/8 x 8 3/8in.

Producer Bill Lawrence was brought in to work on a television series based around the character in 2017. On August 19, 2020, Apple TV+ renewed the series for a 10-episode second season. Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 87% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.72/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Warm and winsome, if not particularly hilarious, Ted Lasso fleshes out its promo premise with unrelenting optimism and a charming turn from Jason Sudeikis.\\" Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly gave the series an A- and wrote, \\"There's nothing groundbreaking about the way Ted Lasso story beats play out, but the show‚Äîa mix of workplace antics, sentimental sports inspo, and soapy romance‚Äîis undeniably winning.\\" Reviewing the series for Rolling Stone, Alan Sepinwall described the series as \\"extremely likable throughout, but it's more a hypothetical comedy than an actual one. There are long stretches where Juno Temple is the only actor even trying to sell what few jokes are in the scripts.\\" and gave a rating of 3/5. Writing for The Guardian, Benjamin Lee gave it 2/5, describing it as \\"a show that isn‚Äôt unwatchably bad but isn‚Äôt really much of anything\\", and suggesting that some of its humor was \\"rooted in some questionable and uneasy stereotypes\\". As the season went on, critical appreciation for the show increased. After the eighth episode aired, Caroline Framke of Variety published a review with the headline \\"For Your Reconsideration: Ted Lasso\\". She went on to say, \\"Above all odds, ‚ÄúTed Lasso‚Äù chipped away at my skepticism until there was none left ‚Äî just like the character himself does to everyone he meets\\", adding \\"At a time when just about everything feels catastrophic, there‚Äôs something undeniably satisfying about spending some time with good people who are just trying to be the best they can, on and off the field.\\" Keri Lumm of Paste Magazine said after the airing of the penultimate episode, \\"Ted Lasso is the wholesome American hero we need\\", going on to say \\"... the landscape of television has felt kind of gloomy, so imagine my surprise when I turned on the TV to Ted Lasso and felt a swelling of a now unfamiliar emotion‚Äîhope.\\" And after the finale aired, Lea Palmieri from Decider said \\"I was a few weeks late to the game after the half- hour comedy premiered... but I saw the buzz building, specifically from people whose recommendations I trust, and so I gave it a go. Now? Well, I simply can‚Äôt shut up about it and here we are.\\" She goes on to say \\"Every step of the way, Ted Lasso proves to be comforting and entertaining and somehow both a distraction and a reminder that kindness is out there, not just on this fictional show, not just across the pond, but deep in the heart of America too.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American comedy television series Category:Apple TV+ original programming Category:American sports television series Category:Fictional association football television series Category:American comedy web series Category:Television series created by Bill Lawrence (TV producer) Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

It was located in the grounds of Achnacarry Castle in the Scottish Highland region of Lochaber.  Background  In 1940 Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, called for the creation of a small raiding force in order to disrupt the Wehrmacht and boost British Morale. Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke proposed a force loosely based on the tactics of the Boer Commandos. Initially these new Commandos units were made up of soldiers from British Army regiments, however in 1942 many Royal Marines Battalions were reorganised into Commandos. They were also supplemented by members of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.  History  Lieutenant Colonel Charles Vaughan inspecting French troops Commandos in training cross a river at Achnacarry under simulated fire. In 1940 Achnacarry Castle, the ancestral seat of Sir Donald Walter Cameron of Lochiel, was brought into use as part of the new Training and Holding Wing for the Special Training Centre Lochailort. Due to the imminent closing of STC Lochailort and the realisation that a centralised training establishment was needed to train the potential commandos, Brigadier Charles Haydon established the Commando Depot in December of 1941. Prior to this each individual Commando Unit was responsible for the training of Commando Personnel . In early 1942 this was redesigned as the Commando Basic Training Centre, and, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Vaughan, the first prospective commandos arrived to complete the centralised course. It then came under the authority of the Special Service Brigade. By this time a drill square had been laid down and pasture within the vicinity of the house had been replaced by asphalt. Nissen huts now stood within the grounds around the drill square. These huts contained accommodation for men, housing between 25 and 40, dining halls, and washing rooms. Due to the secret nature of this training, the British Government prevented people from visiting much of Lochaber by preventing the crossing of non-residents over the Caledonian Canal. The CBTC trained both British Commandos and foreign nationals from occupied countries such as France, Greece, Norway and Poland as well as some Germans, part of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, who were designated 'free Germans'. Contingents from the newly formed United States Army Rangers were also trained there. In 1946 after the war had come to the end it was decided a significant Commando capability was not needed in peacetime and the CBTC at Achnacarry was disbanded. Between 1942 and 1946 over 25,000 personnel were trained at Achnacarry and it is widely believed that it was the birthplace of modern special forces. The Commando Memorial, a memorial to all Commandos of the Second World War, now stands overlooking the training grounds at Achnacarry on a point that all potential Commandos would have passed on the way to CBTC from the Spean Bridge railway station.  Training  The prospective Commando arrived at the Spean Bridge railway station and marched 7 miles to Achnacarry where they began their training, officers, and their men training side by side. Training for a prospective Commando consisted of an intensive regime of physical fitness and instruction in survival, orienteering and vehicle operation. This was alongside instruction on different weapons systems, demolition skills, close-quarter combat as well as amphibious and cliff assault. Any prospective Commando who failed to meet the standard was returned to their parent unit. The training was conducted with live rounds in order to simulate battle as effectively as possible. This realistic training led to the deaths of a number of trainees. In 1943 the focus of the Commando training shifted to more conventional methods of warfare.

Launched by the United States Air Force (USAF) on 6 May 1965, it demonstrated many then-advanced technologies including active use of the military's UHF (ultrahigh-frequency) band (225 to 400 MHz) to service hundreds of users. Background After the successful development and deployment of Project West Ford, a passive communications system consisting of orbiting copper needles, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory turned to improving active-satellite space communications. In particular, Lincoln aimed to increase the transmission capability of communications satellites (\\"downlink\\"), which was necessarily constrained by their limited size. After receiving a charter in 1963 to build and demonstrate military space communications, Lincoln focused on a number of engineering solutions to the downlink problem including improved antennas, better stabilization of satellites in orbit (which would benefit both downlink and \\"uplink\\"‚Äîcommunications from the ground), high-efficiency systems of transmission modulation/de-modulation, and cutting-edge error-checking techniques. These experimental solutions were deployed in a series of nine spacecraft called Lincoln Experimental Satellites (LES). Concurrent with their development, Lincoln also developed the Lincoln Experimental Terminals (LET), ground stations that used interference-resistant signaling techniques that allowed use of communications satellites by up to hundreds of users at a time, mobile or stationary, without involving elaborate systems for synchronization and centralized control. The 1st, 2nd, and 4th satellites in the LES series were designated \\"X-Band satellites,\\" designed to conduct experiments in the \\"X-band\\", the military's UHF (ultrahigh-frequency) band (225 to 400 MHz) because solid-state equipment allowed for comparatively high output in this band, and also because the band had been previously used by West Ford. LES-1, launched 11 February 1965, failed to depart from its original circular medium orbit when its onboard thruster failed to fire. The resultant tumbling and the improper orbit rendered the satellite useless for experimentation purposes. Spacecraft design LES-2 was almost identical to LES-1. After the failure of LES-1, LES-2's ordnance circuitry, responsible for separating the satellite from its Titan carrier, was revised. Polyedral in shape, the spacecraft drew power from 2,376 solar cells, operating only in daylight. LES-1's primary experiments were a solid-state 0.1-watt transmitter, a multiple antenna system switched on by one of the satellite's four optical Earth sensors, and a magnetic coil attitude system. The satellite's transmitter operated in the military UHF (ultrahigh-frequency) band (225 to 400 MHz), because solid-state equipment allowed for comparatively high output in this band, and also because the band had been previously used by West Ford. Eight semi-directional horn units evenly spaced around the satellite comprised the antenna system. Lincoln Experimental Satellite ground communications equipment Mission and results LES-2 was launched along with Lincoln Calibration Sphere (LCS) 1 from Cape Canaveral LC20 6 May, 1965 at 15:00:03 UT on a test flight of the Titan IIIA rocket. After three separate firings of the Titan's transstage over the course of four hours, LES-2 fired its onboard rocket, injecting the satellite into is final orbit.. LES-2 was used in a number of communications experiments and met all expected objectives. The satellite was automatically shut down by its internal clock in 1967. Legacy and status The LES program continued through nine satellites, culminating in the launch of LES-8 and LES-9 on 14 March 1976. As of 29 May 2020, LES-2 is still in orbit.

Early life  Rosalie Loew was born in New York City, the daughter of Hungarian Jewish immigrants William Noah Loew and Leontine (Lottie) Wechsler Lowe. Her father was a lawyer; her mother was a milliner.Felice Batlan, \\"The 'Rabbi's Daughter' and the 'Jewish Jane Addams': Jewish Women, Legal Aid, and the Fluidity of Identity, 1890-1930\\" 4 Indiana Journal of Law & Social Equality 135 (2016): 139-143. Her paternal grandfather, Leopold L√∂w, was a noted rabbi and Jewish leader in Hungary. Loew earned a bachelor's degree in 1892 at Hunter College, and a law degree in 1895 from New York University School of Law.  Career  Loew was admitted to the New York Bar in 1895. In 1896, she was the first woman lawyer to try a case before the New York Supreme Court. She and her father were partners in a law firm, Loew and Loew, before she took a position with the Legal Aid Society in 1897. \\"It is an error to suppose that woman cannot look at things in a large way,\\" she commented in an 1896 newspaper profile. \\"There is nothing in the mental bias of a woman to prevent her having a comprehensive knowledge of any of the affairs of life, no matter how great.\\" She used her language skills (fluency in Hungarian, Yiddish, and German) to represent and interpret for immigrant workers, in cases involving labor violations, predatory loans, and fraud. In 1903, she was rejected for membership in the Bar Association of the City of New York, on the basis of her gender. Whitney was active in the women's suffrage movement in New York City, as a member of the Brooklyn Woman‚Äôs Suffrage Party and as New York congressional chair of the Woman‚Äôs Federal Equality Association. She represented Brooklyn at the National Suffrage Convention in Washington in 1917; and she spoke on behalf of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in a Congressional hearing in 1918. She helped to found the National Women's Republican Club. She attended the Republican National Committee meeting in St. Louis in 1918, working for the party's public support for the 19th Amendment. Whitney and her husband were partners in a law firm, Loew and Whitney, from 1903 to 1907. She served on the board of the Women's Municipal League. From 1919 to 1921, she sat on the New York State Industrial Commission, filling the vacancy left when Frances Perkins went to Washington. In 1930 she was elected director of the Brooklyn Neighborhood Laundry Owners Association. She was in the first group of twelve women admitted to the Bar Association of the City of New York, in 1937; by that time, she had a long career in the law, and had already served two years as justice on the Court of Domestic Relations in New York.  Personal life  Rosalie Loew married fellow lawyer Travis Harvard Whitney in 1903. They had three sons, Travis, John, and William, all born in the first five years of their marriage. Travis Whitney died in 1934; Rosalie Loew Whitney died five years later, in 1939, aged 66, from leukemia. Her grave is in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

She is a Professor of Political Science at Florida International University. She studies civil- military relations in the United States, processes of social change, and the status of women. She has published books on the effectiveness of nonviolent resistance, the results of mandated orders to admit women to the United States Air Force Academy, and the functioning of the U.S. Army War College. She was the first woman to be a university provost in State University System of Florida. Education and positions Stiehm attended the University of Wisconsin, where she earned a BA degree in East Asian Studies. She then graduated from Temple University with an MA in American History, and in 1969 she obtained a PhD in Political Theory from Columbia University. Stiehm has held positions at San Francisco State University, the University of Wisconsin, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California, where she served as the Vice Provost. She has also held visiting or temporary positions at The U.S. Army Peacekeeping Institute and at the Strategic Studies Institute at Carlisle Barracks, and was a Distinguished Visiting Professor at the United States Air Force Academy. Stiehm has served as the Provost and Academic Vice President of Florida International University. She was the first woman to be the Provost of Florida International University, and as of 2019 she had been the only one. This made her the first woman to be a Provost in the State University System of Florida. Research In 1972, Stiehm published the book Nonviolent Power: Active and Passive Resistance. In Nonviolent Power, Stiehm studies the uses of nonviolent resistance and its potential as a tool for social change, focusing on how its use is misunderstood and what the characteristics of successful nonviolent resistance are. She discusses the history of nonviolent resistance in American politics, then studies the connection between nonviolent resistance and other doctrines on the just uses of violence, and the role of nonviolence in a democracy. Stiehm has also published multiple books on the situation of women in the U.S. military: she authored Bring Me Men and Women: Mandated Change at the U.S. Air Force Academy (1981) and Arms and the Enlisted Woman (1989), and edited It's Our Military Too!: Women and the US Military (1996). Bring Me Men and Women studies the mandated introduction of women cadets into the United States Air Force Academy and the institution's response to that change. Arms and the Enlisted Woman studies the situation of women in the United States military and makes specific recommendations to increase their involvement in military planning and operations, and was published at a time when this was a strong contrast with the military's approach. In 2002, she wrote U.S. Army War College: Military Education in a Democracy. This book is a detailed description of the history, classes, faculty, and administration of The U.S. Army War College, drawn from a year that Stiehm spent as an observer there, which makes recommendations for improvements to the functioning of the college. In 2006, Stiehm published the book Champions for Peace: Women Winners of the Nobel Prize for Peace. The book is motivated by the apparent contradiction that peacemaking has traditionally been portrayed as a feminine activity, and yet by that point only 12 women had won the Nobel Peace Prize in more than 100 years. In Champions for Peace, Stiehm writes a biographical sketch of each of those 12 winners, studying the varied backgrounds that led women to become highly successful advocates for peace. Stiehm received the 2008 Frank J. Goodnow Award from The American Political Science Association, which is awarded to recognize \\"outstanding service to the political science community and to the Association\\". She also holds the U.S. Army Distinguished Civilian Service Medal.

The Indonesian language, which believed as an egalitarian and democratic language, has been developing the division of registers into the low-level speech and high-level speech as found in Javanese. This kind of language leveling is said to be the effect of the Javanisation of the Indonesian language.  Overview  Unlike Javanese, Malay language as the origin of Indonesian is considered a democratic language for not having stratified speech levels. However, in its modern development, the Indonesia language demonstrates the indication of polarised language registers, which divided it into high-level speech \\"the polite and formal Indonesian\\" and low-level speech \\"the everyday and informal Indonesian\\". This is believed to be the impact of strong Javanese influence in the Indonesian political landscape.. The Javanese language and way of thinking gradually penetrate the Indonesian language, making it having Indonesian equivalents to Krama or the high-level Javanese and Ngoko or the low-level Javanese. This process occurs without the massive absorption of tangible elements of the Javanese language, instead, it is the Javanese language modality that affects Indonesian heavily. As a consequence of establishing Indonesian krama, the Indonesian ngoko also comes into place. Meanwhile the formal and standard Indonesian becomes the krama of Indonesian, the Jakartan language, to some extent, is believed to be the new-ngoko of the Indonesian language.

Early life and education  Kelley was born in 1958 and grew up in Bellevue, Washington. Her father died right when she finished high school, which required her to work full-time to put herself through college. Her sister, brother, and herself were all first-generation college students. Kelley earned her Bachelors (1983) and Masters of Science (1987) degrees in geology from the University of Washington. She completed her Ph.D. in Geological Sciences from Dalhousie University in 1990. Her dissertation is titled Fluid Circulation in a Submarine Paleohydrothermal System, Troodos Ophiolite, Cyprus: Fluid Inclusion Evidence for Deep-Seated Circulation of Brines in the Oceanic Crust and was completed under the supervision of Paul Robinson. Kelley did postdoctoral research at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution starting in 1990 before moving back to Seattle in 1992, where she finished up her postdoctoral research at the University of Washington through 1995.  Research career  Kelley joined the faculty at the University of Washington in 1995 and is currently a professor in the UW School of Oceanography.

It is affiliated with the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine. The hospital features all private rooms that consist of 246 pediatric beds. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0‚Äì21 throughout the region. The hospital also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. The hospital has a rooftop helipad and is an ACS verified level I pediatric trauma center, the only one in Oklahoma. The hospital features a regional pediatric intensive-care unit and an American Academy of Pediatrics verified level IV neonatal intensive care unit.  History  In April 2011, the Atrium was opened to the public and now serves as the main entrance to the Children's Hospital. The Emergency Room entrance was moved to N.E. 13th Street.The Children's Hospital has an affiliated physicians practice as part of OU Children's Physicians. The doctors work in over 50 pediatric specialties.The Children's Hospital is home to the Women's and Newborn Center, which is known for its high risk specialty care for mothers and newborns. The Women's and Newborn Center is home to the only midwifery service in a central Oklahoma hospital and the only comprehensive lactation service in Oklahoma. It also offers a wide range of prenatal courses and classes. In 2015 the hospital purchased a new helicopter for critically ill neonatal intensive care and pediatric intensive care transport. The new helicopter was named \\"Air Kids One\\" by hospital officials. In July 2019 the hospital announced that they would be expanding their pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to another space in the hospital with a 34-bed capacity. The space that was formerly the PICU was to be converted into a cardiac intensive care unit. In early 2020 the hospital implemented temporary strict visitation protocols in order to help prevent the spread in hospital settings. The change prohibited any visitors under 18 and only allowed one parent per patient in the hospital. In 2020 to help deal with the surge of adult SARS-Cov-2 the hospital opened up its pediatric units to adults with the disease. The hospital also expanded their overall pediatric limit from 21 to 26 to supplement the adult hospitals in the area. Adults on the unit were treated by pediatric nurses and doctors during their stay.  About  Care Units = CHOU has the only American Academy of Pediatrics verified level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the state and the greater region of the midwest. Critically ill newborns from all over the region are transported to the NICU from smaller hospitals that are not equipped to treat these patients. CHOU features the only 24/7 pediatric emergency room in Oklahoma City and the only American College of Surgeons verified level 1 pediatric trauma center in the state of Oklahoma.
