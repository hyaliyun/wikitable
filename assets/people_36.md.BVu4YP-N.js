Thus the product was originally called ammoniacal copper/quaternary ammonium. CompositionCopper complex= The copper in the preparation is in the form of a soluble complex with ammonia or an amine such as ethanolamine ). In any case, the copper content is usually expressed as a weight percentage of the amount of copper oxide that would account for the copper present. As a copper carrier, ammonia has the advantage that it will penetrate difficult-to- treat Western species better than other waterborne preservatives. Otherwise ethanolamine is preferred as copper carrier. =Quaternary ammonium cations=DDA The quaternary ammonium cation in some formulations is didecyldimethylammonium (DDA) . DDA is commercially produced as the carbonate, under the trade name \\"Carboquat\\". The carbonate is used instead of the chloride to reduce corrosion of the treatment equipment. DDA carbonate is non- volatile and highly soluble in water, with near zero octanol-water partition coefficient. ADBA Another quaternary ammonium cation used in some formulations is alkyldimethylbenzylammonium (ADBA). The formula is , where n varies between 8 and 18. =Counterions= Both the copper complex and the quats are positive cations. The counterions (the anions that balance their positive charges) are typically hydroxide , chloride , carbonate or bicarbonate . =Standard formulations= Formulations of ACQ differ in the \\"carrier\\" (complexing agent for copper), either ammonia or ethanolamine; and on the quaternary ammonium cation present. Types registered in the US and Canada: * ACQ-A: copper-ethanolamine (50% CuO equivalent), and DDA chloride (50%). * ACQ-B: copper-ammonia (66.7% CuO) and DDA chloride (33.3%). Not currently registered for use in Canada. * ACQ-C: copper-ammonia and/or copper- ethanolamne (66.7% CuO) and ADBA chloride (30%). * ACQ-D: copper-ethanolamine (66.7% CuO) and DDA chloride or carbonate (33.3%). The ACQ Type D formulation also contains two moldicides: 2-methyl-4- isothiazolin-3-one and 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one. The ammonia carrier ACQ-B improves its ability to penetrate into wood that is difficult to treat, like some US Western lumber. The formulations with ethanolamine, especially ACQ-D, are generally used for easier woods (such as southern pine) because it provides a more uniform surface appearance. Mechanism of action During the wood treatment process, the water-soluble copper and the quaternary ammonium cations are immobilized by the formation of stable insoluble compounds with lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose and other wood components. The copper is the primary bactericide and fungicide agent. The quaternary ammonium cation is added to prevent growth of copper-tolerant bacteria, fungus, and mold, as an insecticide. Use ACQ is applied at a timber treatment plants by industrial vacuum-pressure impregnation. The ACQ-C product is normally shipped from manufacturer as a concentrated solution that is diluted at the wood treatment plant. ACQ-D and ACQ-A are shipped as two separate solutions that are mixed and diluted at the latter. In the US and other countries, ACQ is registered for use on lumber, timbers, landscape ties, fence posts, building and utility poles, land, freshwater and marine pilings, sea walls, decking, wood shingles, and other wood structures.http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/reregistration/cca/acq.htm =Treated wood color= Wood treated with ACQ has greenish-brown color which may fade to brown, and may have a slight ammonia odor until the wood dries. Safety In the treated wood, the copper is relatively harmless and not an environmental or health concern. DDA chloride is approved as germicide, fungicide, and algicide for disinfectant products that have been used for decades in hospitals and other commercial and industrial establishments. ADBA chloride has been used in commercial products in the US since 1947. A registration standard was issued by EPA in 1985 One disadvantage of ACQ is that significant amounts of air pollution, in the form of ammonia, are released from treatment plants and freshly treated wood in storage yards. While the CCA components are far more toxic in a weight basis, being non-volatile solids they can be effectively contained. =Fastener corrosion= The copper in ACQ treated wood accelerates corrosion of galvanized steel fasteners (such as nails and screws) 10 times or more in comparison with CCA-treated wood. Stainless steel (AISI 316) is not affected. Aluminium and Galvalum fasteners should be avoided. One should use fasteners made of hot-dipped galvanized copper or stainless steel All ACQ treatments accelerate corrosion of metal fasteners relative to untreated wood. Hot-dipped galvanized, copper or stainless steel fasteners must be used.http://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdfpubs/pdf06772809/pdf06772809dpi72pt03.pdf History ACQ technology was developed and patented in Canada and improved in the U.S. It has been in commercial production in Europe, Japan and the U.S. since the late 1980s. Wood products treated with ACQ preservative were commercially produced in Canada for the first time in 2004. ACQ became a widely used wood preservative after concerns were raised about possible environmental contamination by chromium and arsenic from wood treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA), through contact (especially in playgrounds), leaching, sawing and sanding, or burning.http://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdfpubs/pdf06772809/pdf06772809dpi72pt03.pdf These concerns led to the virtual banning of CCA for residential purposes by the US EPA, in 2003-2004. Chemical Specialties, Inc (CSI, now Viance) received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2002 for commercial introduction of ACQ.

He has written as a literary critic, epistemologist, sociology of culture analyst and philosopher. Education and career Canaparo was born in the city port of Campana, Argentina, to a mother of Hebrew origins and an Italian rooted father; he was a traveller, manual worker and scientific researcher before entering academia. He studied at the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Rosario, at the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO) in Buenos Aires, at the DAMS (delle arti, della musica e dello spettacolo) at the Universit√† degli Studi di Bologna, and received his Ph.D. under the supervision of William Rowe at King's College London in 2000. Prevented from working in Europe as a philosopher or social scientist, he developed most of his projects in academia as a ‚ÄòLatin American specialist‚Äô. He joined the Faculty of Arts at Exeter University in 1995 where in 2004 he created the Centre for Latin American Studies. In 2009 he was appointed Visiting Professor at Birkbeck College, where he stays until 2015. He was also Associated Researcher at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium between 2007 and 2012. In 2012 he started to supervise and teach within the postgraduate program from the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes and from Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires, both in Argentina. In the same year he developed a project of teaching basic philosophy to 8‚Äì10 years old children from ‚ÄòArc-en-Ciel‚Äô public school of Feugarolles in France. In 2014 he started to work within a multinational team of researchers and ONGs in a multidisciplinary project about climate change in relation with colonialism and geo-epistemology. In 2015 he started also to teach philosophy at the Lyc√©e Stendhal (Aiguillon) and at the Lyc√©e George Sand (N√©rac), both in France. And as replacing professor from 2018 at Lyc√©e Jean-Baptiste de Baudre (Agen). Themes and related subjects A. The principal effort of his work goes to establish the relation between knowledge and conceptual evolution, mainly focused on theories and related concepts about space with peripheral areas of the planet or, more precisely, having the peripheral spaces of the planet as its main intellectual frame. Themes of his works also include sociology of knowledge (Muerte y transfiguraci√≥n de la cultura rioplatense, 2005), epistemology and colonialism, authorship theory (The Manufacture of an Author, 2000; El mundo Ingaramo, 2015), and science and writing. Ciencia y escritura (2003) The book discusses how the activity of writing determines the notion of knowledge which supports the ‚Äòideology‚Äô of scientificity. Further more, the book explores how, when and why, the laboratory becomes the center of legitimization of modern science. To illustrate the argument, specific as well as generic leading cases, were explored. An article discussing the so-called ‚Äòtwo-slit experiment‚Äô is the first leading case, and an exhaustive analysis of the journal Nature constitutes the second leading case. Geo-epistemology (2009) The idea that we cannot establish a critical way of thinking, at least within peripheral areas of the planet, without having a standing in biosphere terms is the main hypothesis of this book. This work attempts to show how to proceed under these premises. La emancipaci√≥n intelectual (2010-2011) (unpublished) A tetralogy about Latin America, which concentrates in the conceptual consequences colonialism, particularly looking at language, knowledge and what the author calls post-territoriality. This tetralogy also develops the idea of a second degree of colonialism, which refers to a number of objects, domains and concepts -highly productive in terms of knowledge and understanding- where colonialism is not usually analyzed. The first volume of this tretalogy, entitled ‚ÄòViaje en Egipto. La formulaci√≥n espacial del colonialismo y sus consecuencias‚Äô [Travel within Egypt. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its consequences], analyses contemporary colonialism within peripheral places from the point of view of the relationship between knowledge and diaspora. The second volume, entitled ‚ÄòEl pensamiento del ojo en las colonias. La formulaci√≥n espacial del colonialismo y sus visiones‚Äô [The eye‚Äôs thought. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its visions], focus on visual perception and visual developments as a way of dominant cogito in peripheral areas. The third volume, entitled ‚ÄòEl autor perif√©rico. La formulaci√≥n espacial del colonialismo y sus identidades‚Äô [The peripheral author. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its identities], focus on the constitution of a parallel phenomenon: the constitution of the notion of self and the constitution of a narrative entity usually called authorship. Finally, the fourth volume, entitled ‚ÄòLa negociaci√≥n del espacio y los sentimientos bajo el colonialism‚Äô [The negotiation of space and feelings under the colonialism], focus on the way the constitution of a sentimental life within individuals in peripheral areas of the planet is dominated by technological set-ups referred to a number of activities, from writing to learning, and from eating to building houses. El imaginario Patagonia (2011) How the relation between biosphere spaces and conceptual evolution works, within peripheral areas of the planet, is the main topic of this book. To explore the argument an exhaustive and length argumentation concerning Patagonia has been established as the leading case. B. The notion of ‚Äòpensamiento perif√©rico‚Äô emerges then as a way to develop the hypothesis of ‚Äòreversal thinking‚Äô and proposed as a first approximation to the geo- epistemology approach,. Developed as a project in a four-volumes series between 2015 and 2018 it has one volume dedicated to the relation of peripheral ‚Äòpensamiento‚Äô with the European philosophy and its history; a second volume which attempts to establish a general conceptual framework, a third volume revisiting the notion of anthropology and nature, and a final volume which explores a leading case focusing on the idea of ‚Äòdisposal, trash, rubbish, dust‚Äô (basura, residuo) as an epistemic and anthropological problem. La cuesti√≥n perif√©rica (forthcoming) How, when and under which format the ways of thinking in peripheral areas of the planet have been colonized, not only by European philosophy, but mainly by the way in which such philosophy has been studied, developed and historiographisized, even locally: such questions are conceptually addressed in this book and constitute its main purpose. El mundo de atr√°s (2018) The book develops the main conceptual frame under which the ‚Äòpensamiento‚Äô -as a way to combine a thought about ‚Äòthings‚Äô (bodies, apparatuses, objects, mechanisms), technology and a biosphere dimension- can be established in peripheral areas of the planet. El fin de la naturaleza (forthcoming) What is the relation between the anthropological concept of human, within peripheral areas of the planet, and a notion of nature is the main question of this book. The increasing relevance of the non-human in the definition of human is one of the phenomena explored within the arguments, as well as the radical change of the idea of ‚Äòviviente‚Äô (living thing). El pensamiento basura (2017) How the ‚Äòbasura‚Äô (trash, disposals, rubbish) becomes a central component of our daily life is as important as its consequences in material and non-material terms. From this starting point the book explores what and in which way the ‚Äòbasura‚Äô determines our way of thinking, our individuality, as well as our material existence in peripheral areas of the planet.

It is a highly unusual hydrogen-deficient carbon- rich star. V605 Aquilae was first recorded as a nova in 1919, but it turned out to be a very unusual variable. It was measured to be magnitude 10.4 at its peak. Investigation of prior photographs showed that it was magnitude 15 or fainter until 1918, when it brightened to 12th magnitude. It stayed at 11th magnitude or brighter for over a year, before fading from sight. It then brightened to 12th magnitude in late 1921 and again in 1923, before disappearing. The spectral type at the time of the outbursts was R0, a cool hydrogen-deficient carbon star similar to some R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. V605 Aquilae was subsequently detected several times at magnitudes 18‚Äì20, but these are likely to have been detections only of a small knot of nebulosity surrounding the position of the star. Hubble images show that the star itself was fainter than magnitude 23, although the nebulosity was a bright irregular infrared object 2.5\\" across. It was suspected that the star was still luminous but largely hidden by the dense nebulosity. Although the star could not be detected directly, scattered light showed a [WC4] spectral type, quite different from the spectrum at peak brightness. In 2013, the central star was detected at magnitude 20.2, with an estimated four magnitudes of extinction. The spectral type is now [WC4], a hydrogen-deficient, helium and carbon-rich object with strong emission lines. In 1921, the surface has been estimated to consist of 98% helium and 1% carbon, typical of an RCB star. By 2006, the abundances were measured as 55% helium, 45% carbon, and 5% oxygen, typical of a WC star. Both are very unusual, compared to the majority of stars that are mostly hydrogen. Starting around 1970, the temperature began to increase and is now over 90,000 K. It is widely believed to be a born-again star, a post- asymptotic-giant-branch star which experienced a very late thermal pulse and began to fuse again. An alternative explanation is that the outburst was a nova from an oxygen-neon white dwarf. To explain difficulties with the nova theory, a merger has been proposed between a white dwarf and a normal companion star. V605 Aquilae is at the centre of a planetary nebula and is believed to be the source of the nebula. The visible planetary nebula is approximately spherical and far older than the 1919 outburst. A much smaller nebula originating from the outburst is non-spherical. The shape may be a disc plus a bipolar nebula or torus containing a dusty band. The band or disc almost entirely obscures the central star. Comparison of the angular size changes of the nebula and its radial velocities suggest a distance of 4,600 parsecs.

BiographyEarly life= Born in 1879 to Kaviraj Panchanan Ray (Kavichintamoni) in Poyogram village in the Khulna District of India (now in Bangladesh), he initially attended the local village school. At an early age he was sent to nearby Calcutta (then the capital of British India) and graduated high school at the age of 14 from South Suburban School in the Bhowanipore neighbourhood of South Calcutta. =Education= After high school, Kaviraj Jamini Bhushan Ray enrolled himself for his Bachelor of Arts studies at Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta. Upon completion of his bachelor's degree, he simultaneously started pursuing his Master of Arts studies at Government Sanskrit College, and worked towards getting his medical degree at Calcutta Medical College. All along this time, at home he was taking lessons on Ayurveda ‚Äì the ancient Indian medical science ‚Äì from his father ‚Äì a renowned practitioner in his own right. While still studying medicine he earned his master's degree in Arts (M.A.) majoring in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit. Then in 1905, when he completed his Bachelor of Medicine (M.B.) and also M.R.A.S., he stood first in his class and was awarded a Gold Medal; the accompanying citation mentioned his high proficiency in \\"Gynaecology and Midwifery\\". It was then that he decided that he would not pursue a career in western medicine ‚Äì instead, like his father before him he would be a Kaviraj, or an Indian Ayurvedic doctor. That's when he started formally taking lessons on Ayurveda from Kaviraj Mahamahopadhyay Bijoy Ratna Sen, the leading Ayurvedic physician of that era. Subsequently, he embarked on his illustrious career when Bagala Marwari Hospital hired him as a Kaviraj for a monthly salary of Rupees Forty ‚Äì a princely sum in those days. =Medical practice= In 1906, following the family profession, Jamini Bhushan Ray started practising the ancient Indian system of Ayurveda ‚Äì despite being educated in the western system of medicine. In those days the practise of Ayurveda was not glamorous, considered ancient, and way past its prime. His friends and well wishers tried to dissuade him from his chosen path, instead advising him to practice western medicine ‚Äì in which he was already well- versed. But he refused, saying: ‚ÄúIf I cannot make a living practising Ayurveda, then I shall make a living by selling Panchan (Ayurvedic laxative).‚Äù With a view to reviving the glory of Ayurveda, lost over the ages mainly due to India's rule by foreign powers and their lack of support for ancient Indian traditions, Dr. Ray set up the Vaidyaraj Pharmacy that sold only Ayurvedic medicines. He and his staff at the pharmacy made pioneering attempts to standardise Ayurvedic medicine in accordance with modern scientific methods. His fame soon spread far and wide. To raise awareness and fund his research ‚Äì he increased his fees from Rupees 4 to Rupees 32, while treatment of poor people who couldn't afford his fees was always free. Out of town trips to visit wealthy patients cost them Rupees 1,000 ‚Äì which they gladly paid. His patients included the Maharajas of Gwalior, Indore and Tipperah. By 1915 he was sort of a celebrity in the field of Ayurvedic medicine, and that year was elected President of the 7th All India Ayurvedic Conference in Madras. During that visit to the Southern city, he was highly impressed with the functioning of and the amenities at Madras Ayurvedic College and decided he would establish a similar institution in his native Calcutta. In 1916, at a rented house on 29 Fariapukur Street, he set up the Ashtanga Ayurveda College and Hospital. Dr Ray's practical idealism for amalgamating the ancient with the modern soon caught the attention of Mahatma Gandhi; and 9 years later, on 6 May 1925, it was Gandhi who laid the foundation stone for the institute's new building on Raja Dinendra Street ‚Äì where the J B Roy State Ayurvedic Medical College and Hospital still stands. In 2016 the college celebrated its centenary. =Philanthropy= Aside from contributing Rupees 70,000 of his own money for the construction of the new buildings, in his last will Kaviraj Jamini Bhushan Ray bequeathed to his institution large portions of immovable property that he owned at various place in India. These include: * 13 Cottahs (9,360 square feet) of land in upscale Ballygunge neighbourhood of Calcutta. * 6 Cottahs (4,320 square feet) of land on Grey Street (in the Central business district), Calcutta. * 12 Bighas (172,800 square feet) of land including his garden house at Patipukur ** The Patipukur TB Hospital is currently located on this landed property * His estate in Kurseong, a hill station nestled in the Himalayas near Darjeeling. * His estate in Ranchi, capital of Jharkhand, India. Books (Though titled in English ‚Äì all books were originally written in Sanskrit) * Diseases ‚Äì Their Origin and Diagnosis. * A Treatise on Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat and Mouth. * The care of infants and the diseases of children. * A Manual of Toxicology. These books are based on ancient Indian \\"Salakya Tantra\\" (Otolaryngology, or Ear, Nose, Throat), \\"Prashuti Tantra\\" (Gynecology), \\"Bisha Tantra\\" (Toxicology) and \\"Kumara Tantra\\" (Pediatrics). Particularly his book \\"Diseases ‚Äì Their Origin and Diagnosis\\" brought him wide reputation and critical acclaim. He published a monthly journal in Bengali called \\"Ayurveda\\". Personal life Kaviraj Jamini Bhushan Ray was married to Saroj Bala Devi, and had 6 children. Like their father, his sons Bijoy Bhushan, Hari Bhushan and Kali Bhushan were brilliant students. However the 2 younger sons prematurely died in their late teens. Death and legacy Jamini Bhushan Ray suddenly died in Calcutta on 11 August 1926 ‚Äì just a day after he donated 200,000 Rupees to his beloved Ashtanga Ayurveda Vidyalaya. He was just 47 years old. In his honour a road in Calcutta, not far from Ashtanga Ayurveda Hospital, has been named Jamini Kaviraj Row. 7 years after his death ‚Äì in his garden house at Patipukur, was established Patipukur TB Hospital. Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, eminent physician, freedom fighter and later Chief Minister of West Bengal, laid the foundation stone.

Cooke founded the charity Operation Christmas Child (now Samaritan's Purse) in 1990 and developed, then worked for, the biggest shoebox programme in the world. Early years Cooke was born in Chester, the second child of John and Ruth Cooke. His father worked in sales and his mother ran the household. He was brought up in the Exclusive Brethren church but found growing up in the Brethren very restrictive, and he rebelled from an early age. He attended Hoole Secondary Modern but left at the age of 14 with no qualifications and several brushes with the law. Mr Fox, his headteacher at the time, said \\"Cooke, you will never achieve anything with your life.\\" Cooke trained to be a joiner and had his own glazing company. In 1981, Cooke had his own kitchen design and fitting business which failed in less than two years. He then went on to establish a window installation company which grew nationally and was bought out in 1986. From 1986, Cooke worked as a contracts manager for Rowcroft Windows until 1995, when he became a Projects Manager and Children's Advocate for Samaritan's Purse.  Charitable work  In October 1990, Cooke was having a meal with a good friend John Roberts and suggested they take a truck to Romania with aid for the orphans there. The news had recently broken of Ceausescu orphanages and the images of the children were appearing on television. He rounded up his friends John Roberts and Dai Hughes alongside his brother Paul Cooke to help. Operation Christmas Child hit the headlines and snowballed in a matter of months. In December 1990, a convoy of 9 trucks departed Wrexham through a crowd of support with a marching band, heading for Romania with over ¬£600,000 of aid. From 1990 to 1995, Operation Christmas Child grew exponentially, delivering shoeboxes to Belarus, Bosnia and Romania. In 1995, negotiations started with the American International charity Samaritan's Purse who had the means of taking OCC global and the charities were merged. Cooke continued to work for Samaritan's Purse until 2006, in various roles as HIV advocate in Africa, international child advocate and an international projects manager developing the \\"Second Chance\\" programme which involved going into prisons and reaching out to juveniles and young adults through empowerment and sports. In 2006, Cooke founded Teams4U, an international humanitarian aid charity based in Wrexham who take volunteers overseas to facilitate health, education, training and empowerment programs in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. In 2013, Teams4U launched its own national shoebox program bringing Christmas gifts to deprived children in Eastern Europe.

The cluster sensu stricto contains the genera Mycoplasma mycoides and Mycoplasma capricolum and comprises six species and subspecies: *M. mycoides subsp. mycoides biotype Small Colony (MmmSC) *M. mycoides subsp. mycoides biotype Large Colony (MmmLC) *M. mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc) *M. capricolum subsp. capricolum (Mcc) *M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (Mccp) *Mycoplasma sp. 'bovine group 7' (MBG7) The last one is disputed with respect to the question of being a separate species. In 2009, L. Manso-Silv√°n et al. proposed to consider M. mycoides subsp. mycoides biotype Large Colony as equal with M. mycoides subsp. capri. Furthermore, they proposed the name Mycoplasma leachii sp. nov. for Mycoplasma sp. 'bovine group 7' as a separate species. Minimal genome project In 2010, as part of the Minimal Genome Project, a team of the J. Craig Venter Institute synthesized a modified version (JCVI-syn1.0) of the 1,000,000 base pair M. mycoides genome and implanted it into a DNA-free bacterial shell of Mycoplasma capricolum; the resulting organism was shown to be self-replicating. In 2016, the Venter Institute used genes from the JCVI- syn1.0 to synthesize an even smaller genome they call JCVI-syn3.0, that contains 531,560 base pairs and 473 genes. A comparison of these two genomes revealed a common set of 256 genes which the team thinks could represent a minimal set of genes needed for viability.

According to the principles governing the elections laws, set down in Art. 38 of German Basic Law, elections are to be universal, direct, free, equal, and secret. Furthermore, the German Basic Law stipulates that Bundestag elections are to take place every four years and that one can vote, and be elected, upon reaching the age of 18. All other stipulations for the federal elections are regulated by the Federal Electoral Act. Elections always take place on a Sunday. Mail votes are possible upon application. Germans elect their members of parliament with two votes. The first vote is for a direct candidate, who ought to receive a plurality vote in their electoral district. The second vote is used to elect a party list in each state as established by its respective party caucus. The Bundestag comprises seats representing each electoral district, with the remainder of seats being allocated to maintain proportionality based on the second vote. Common practice is that direct candidates are also placed on the electoral lists at higher rankings as a fall-back if they do not win their districts.  Constitutional basis  Principles governing the law of elections = According to Article 38, ¬ß1 of the German constitution, ‚Äúthe delegates of the German Parliament (Bundestag) [‚Ä¶] are elected in a general, direct, free, equal and secret vote.‚Äù These five principles of suffrage are fundamental rights: Any violation of the law can be brought up to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in form of a constitutional complaint. An election is general, if basically every citizen can take part in it: there are no restrictions such as in terms of income, sex, health or any other arbitrary distinctions. But according to the jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court, the prescription of a minimum voting age is compatible with the commonalty of the election. The exclusion from the active right to vote is also ‚Äì within narrow limitations ‚Äì consistent with the Basic Constitutional Law. The exclusion of the passive right to vote is governed by somewhat less strict regulations. Election posters in N√ºrnberg, Federal Election of 1961 The right to vote is in principle reserved for German citizens and the so-called ‚Äústatus Germans‚Äù who are refugees and expelled persons of German descent that settled in Germany. The introduction of a right to vote for foreigners would require an alteration of ¬ß20 of the constitution. An election is immediate if the voters will determines the result directly. The process of an election based on lists compiled by the political parties is, however, compatible with the principle of an immediate election. An election is considered free if the government does not compel the people's voting decision in terms of content. According to the Federal Constitutional Court's dispensation of justice the principle of a free ballot would not be harmed if a compulsory vote was introduced by the Federal Electoral Law. Electoral advertising at government expense would, however, be incompatible with this principle of electoral law. However, the Federal Government (made up of different political parties) is allowed to conduct public relations if its neutrality is strictly preserved. Elections are confidential if the voter's decision is not known to anybody else. The German Parliament's voting law even states that no elector is allowed to announce his decision in the polling station. Postal voting is problematic because the secrecy of the ballot is not guaranteed; it has therefore to be taken as an exceptional case. Since the election's more important basic principle of universal suffrage would otherwise be violated, postal votes are admissible. In principle an election is considered equal if all electoral votes have the same weight. This is for example not the case if constituencies differ considerably in size or if the way these constituencies are politically controlled causes advantages or disadvantages for certain groups of people (gerrymandering). For electoral lawmaking the most difficult part in terms of constitutional principles is the equality of the election. On the one hand, certain inequalities are unavoidable as the constituencies can not be of exactly equal size and the turnout, too, is not homogenous. On the other hand, the ‚Äú√úberhangmandate‚Äù (the \\"overhang\\", or extra seats in Parliament a party gets due to gaining more constituency seats than it is entitled to according to Parliament's proportional seating principle) and a ‚Äúnegatives Stimmgewicht‚Äù (negative vote value: an unwanted outcome changing an elector's vote to the opposite of their intended political will expressed with that vote) might influence the ‚Äúone man, one vote‚Äù principle. On 3 July 2008, the Federal Constitutional Court declared the paradox of the ‚Äúnegatives Stimmgewicht‚Äù to be unconstitutional. The court allowed three years for these changes, so the 2009 federal election was not affected. The changes were due by 30 June 2011, but appropriate legislation was not completed by that deadline. A new electoral law was enacted in late 2011, but declared unconstitutional once again by the Federal Constitutional Court upon lawsuits from the opposition parties and a group of some 4,000 private citizens. Finally, four of the five factions in the Bundestag agreed on an electoral reform whereby the number of seats in the Bundestag will be increased as much as necessary to ensure that any overhang seats are compensated through apportioned leveling seats, to ensure full proportionality according to the political party's share of party votes at the national level. The Bundestag approved and enacted the new electoral reform in February 2013. The five percent rule and the basic mandate clause are further strong interventions because they completely reject the influence of entire political streams and their voters in the parliament. The five percent rule and the overhang (in German: √úberhangmandate) are in principle approved by the Federal Constitutional Court and the German jurisprudence. = Suffrage = Right to vote  Suffrage is the civil right to vote. All German citizens over the age of 18 are allowed to vote (Art. 38, para. 2 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany), as long as they have lived in Germany for at least a three-month continuous period that was within 25 years of the election. According to Art. 20, para. 2, p. 1 all power emanates from the people, that is the people of Germany. Therefore, Art. 12 para. 1 of German Federal Electoral Law determines in accordance with constitutional law, that only Germans in the sense of Art. 116, para. 1 are eligible to vote. Excluded from suffrage are Germans, * who have been deprived of active suffrage by a court in connection with a conviction because of delicts within the fields of treason, compromise of the democratic constitutional state, threat to the external national security, criminal offence against constitutional bodies, as well as criminal offence at elections and ballots, as well as indictable offences against the national defence. (¬ß¬ß 13 Nr. 1 BWahlG, 92a, 101, 108c, 109i, 45 Abs. 5 StGB) * for whom had been ordered a custodian with contained field of activity through interlocutory injunction (¬ß 13 Nr. 2 BWahlG) * who find themselves in an asylum according to ¬ß¬ß 63, 20 StGB after having committed an illegal action being criminally incapable because of an order from the criminal court  Eligibility to stand for election  Every German who has reached the age of majority, in Germany 18 years, is eligible to stand for election according to the German Basic Law (article 38, paragraph 2 BL). It has to be remarked that the age of majority can be altered by a simple federal law. Eligibility to stand for election presupposes the right to vote. However, some German citizens are not permanent residents of Germany and also do not have the right to vote as a German citizen living abroad. They can still be elected if they meet all the other requirements. Yet, people can be deprived of their eligibility to stand for election in certain circumstances. This can happen in the case of an imprisonment of more than a year as is laid down in ¬ß 45, subparagraph 1 in the Strafgesetzbuch, the German criminal law.  Election management bodies  The most important election management body is the Federal Returning Officer, appointed by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Responsibilities include running electoral procedures and chairing the election committee. The leader of the Federal Statistical Office usually holds this office. The Federal Returning Officer is assisted by the electoral committee and the Returning Officers of each Bundesland, the election supervisors and the electoral committee of each constituency as well as the election judges and the managing committee of each electoral ward. They are appointed by the federal government. The other members of the electoral committees are appointed by the Returning Officer. Election management bodies (EMBs) are institutions of independent, societal self-organisation. In general they are considered to be a sort of federal agency. The Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Supreme Federal Authority, is responsible for the enactment of certain regulations necessary for federal election procedures. However, the Federal Ministry of the Interior does not have the authority to issue directives against the election management bodies.  Scrutiny of elections  Within two months after the federal election (German: Bundestagswahl) any voter can request the scrutiny of elections. According to the established practice of the Federal Constitutional Court (German: Bundesverfassungsgericht) the Committee for the Scrutiny of Elections of the Bundestag, the parliament of Germany, has to reject a request if the distribution of mandates did not change even with the request being granted. The Committee for the Scrutiny of Elections only makes sure that the Federal Voting Act is implemented properly; it does not deal with possible unconstitutionalities. If the Bundestag rejects the veto, an appeal to scrutiny of elections can be lodged to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany within another two months. This appeal has to be joined by 100 eligible voters. If the veto is successful, the affected member will lose his or her seat in parliament. This member can in turn file a lawsuit against the adjudication. No appeal to scrutiny of elections against decisions made by the German Bundestag has thus far been successful.  Party structure  Membership = Political parties are required to be membership-based, and the party determines its membership based upon its own bylaws, i.e., the party itself determines who can join, leave, and who is excluded from the party.¬ß 2(1) PartG, \\"Parties are associations of citizens‚Ä¶\\". ¬ß 6(2) PartG, \\"The statutes must contain provisions on ‚Ä¶ joining and leaving the party‚Ä¶\\". Applications for membership may be rejected without justification, and party bylaws may impose requirements and restrictions on membership, but may not discriminate based on gender, age, religion or ethnicity. All parties have membership fees, which range from 0.5%‚Äì4.0% of members' salaries, with reduced fees for low-income members. There is no collective membership. (For example, some countries' labor unions have enrolled its members in parties automatically.) A 2015 state-level party convention in Stuttgart As parties can reject applications without justification, it's possible to discriminate unofficially. The feminist party Die Frauen even calls all its members women in its bylaws, but claims this term also applies to men. = Governance = Full membership assemblies are used at the local- or district-level, but most parties rely on delegate assemblies ( or party conventions) above district- level, although all established parties use non-binding full membership referendums for important decisions such as leadership selection.¬ß 9 PartG. ¬ß 17 PartG.  Appointment of candidates  The parties' right to propose candidates = Only parties that have been represented in the Bundestag or a Landtag by at least five delegates since the last election are entitled to propose their own candidates. Other parties have to announce their candidature to the Federal Returning Officer in time, i.e. not later than 90 days before the election day of periodic elections of the Bundestag. They must have been accepted as a party by the Federal Electoral Committee beforehand. =Proposal of candidates for constituencies= The applicants from a party must be elected in a democratic and secret election by an assembly of the party members in a constituency or by a similar board appointed by the party. Every party member entitled to vote is allowed to propose candidates. A candidate does not have to be a member of the party. Since the 2009 German Bundestag elections no member of a different party may be nominated. A written record of the election must be presented to the District Returning Officer, who is responsible for checking the proposal. He points out possible deficiencies and allows remedies to be made. A county election nomination is only accepted if the nominee belongs to a party that is represented in the Bundestag or the Landtag, or if the party represents a national minority. Otherwise the nominee must have at least 200 signatures from eligible voters in the constituency. It does not make a difference whether the suggestion is handed in by a party or not. Hence a candidate does not need to be supported by a party in a constituency if he has sufficient signatures. The county election nominee must also nominate a person of trust and a proxy who are allowed to release statements to the leader of the county election. A county election nomination can be recalled either by a joint statement from the two persons of trust or by a statement from the majority of the signataries of the nominee. Through a declaration from the two persons of trust the name of the suggested person can be changed in case the originally suggested person loses his eligibility or dies. Once the nomination is authorised it can neither be recalled nor changed. If a candidate with a direct mandate dies before election day, the election is cancelled in this constituency. Within the next six weeks, the election is held again, allowing the deceased candidate's party to appoint a substitute candidate. This by-election follows the same rules as the main election. This means that Germans who have come of age in the time between the main and the by-election are not allowed to vote. =Regional lists of parliamentary candidates for election to Federal Parliament= According to the Federal Election Law the nominations for the regional lists basically result from the same system as the constituency nominations. In addition, the order of the regional list is determined by secret election. The regional list of a party which is neither represented in the Federal Parliament nor in a State Parliament and which does not represent a national minority, requires for its admission the signing of at least one-thousandth of the state's eligible voters, not exceeding 2,000 signatures. For the nomination of confidants and the modification of the regional list, the regulations concerning the constituency nominations are applied correspondingly. For the calculation of the electoral threshold, the candidate lists on state level of one party are generally treated as connected, unless the confidants issue a differing declaration to the Federal Returning Officer. Voting system 16th Bundestag. The voter has two votes. The federal election system distinguishes between 'first' and 'second' votes. However, these terms refer neither to a hierarchical order of importance of the votes, nor to a logical (chronological) sequence in a valid election process. According to public polls, about 70% (2002) to 63% (2005) of the voters mistakenly thought the first vote to be more important than the second. In some state election systems that have two voting systems modelled after the federal election setup, the votes are called 'vote for person' and 'vote for list'. It is important that both votes have distinct functions. =First vote= The first vote allows the elector to vote for a direct candidate of their constituency, who applies for a direct mandate in the Bundestag (see illustration above, no. 2). Relative majority voting is used, which means that the candidate who receives most of the votes gets the mandate. If the vote results in a tie, the lot drawn by the leader of the regional election is decisive. In this case, the votes for the other candidates are invalid. The primary function of the first vote is to personalize the election. As there are 299 constituencies at the moment, the same number of mandates in the Bundestag are distributed to the elected candidates in each district. However, the first vote does not determine the power of the parties in the Bundestag. For each direct mandate in a Bundesland the party always receives one mandate less from the second vote. The size and the geographical shape of the electoral constituencies are revised by an electoral committee appointed by Germany's Head of State. The final decision is made by the German Bundestag and can be found in an attachment to the federal electoral law. =Second vote= For the distribution of seats in the German Bundestag, the second vote is more important than the first vote. This second vote allows the elector to vote for a party whose candidates are put together on the regional electoral list. Based on the proportion of second votes, the 598 mandates are distributed to the parties who have achieved at least 5 percent of valid second votes (i.e. reached the electoral threshold). Since the 1987 German Bundestag elections, the distribution of seats was made according to the Hare-Niemeyer method. Due to a change in the law passed in January 2008, the distribution of seats is now made according to the Sainte-Lagu√´/Schepers method. The proportion of seats a party gets in the Bundestag approximately equates to the percentage of votes the party gets in the election. Discrepancies result from overhang and the electoral threshold. According to ¬ß6, para. 1, clause 2 of the Federal Election Law the electors' second votes are not accounted for if those electors give their first votes to a successful and autonomous direct candidate (a candidate who is not nominated by a party). This rule is designed to prevent a double influence on the composition of the Bundestag. A similar problem occurred at the federal election in 2002. The PDS got two direct mandates in Berlin, but with only 4.0% of second votes they failed to pass the electoral threshold. The second votes from the electors who voted for those direct candidates counted nevertheless, since in this case both candidates belonged to a party which had handed in a regional list in the respective Bundesland. In its decision of November 23, 1988 (Federal Constitutional Law 79, 161), the Federal Constitutional Court pointed out the relevant loophole in the Federal Election Law to the legislative body. Abolishing the system with first and second votes with the possibility of splitting votes ‚Äì meaning the elector's option to vote for a direct candidate and for a party independently ‚Äì would solve the problem automatically. =Abstention and spoilt votes= German parliamentary election law does not have explicit abstention; a ballot paper without markings on it is considered a spoilt vote (separated into first and second vote). Furthermore, votes are spoilt if the voter's intention cannot be recognised without doubt, if the ballot paper contains additions or conditions or if it is not an official document. Since the general elections in 2009, only the first vote is spoilt on ballot papers designed for a different constituency as long as they contain the correct regional list for the second vote. The law of the German federal election does not consider ballot papers which are marked in a way that endangers the confidentiality of the ballot (as, for example, votes marked with an upright cross) as spoilt. There are further reasons for invalidity concerning the postal vote: Both votes are invalidated if the envelope for the postal vote is empty, if it contains several differently marked ballot papers or if it actually should have been rejected (including also those ballot paper envelopes which differ from the rest in a way that endangers the election secrecy.) In contrast, the votes of voters who die or lose their right to vote before the ballot vote takes place explicitly remain valid. Invalid votes, equally to non posted votes, have no effect on the result of the poll. Nevertheless, their number is officially counted and published. According to ¬ß 4 of the election statistics act, the cause of invalidity is also a census criterion to be mentioned in the official election statistics. The numbers for a total of twelve categories of (partly) invalid ballot papers have been published at last (for the Federal Parliament elections in 2005). However, it only concerns combinations of the three basic categories ‚Äúempty or crossed out‚Äù, ‚Äúmultiple crosses‚Äù and ‚Äúother causes‚Äù, divided into first and second votes. Thus one can hardly deduce the reason for the invalidity; whether it was a matter of purpose, mistake or just ignorance of the voting right. For combinations of invalid and valid votes on a ballot paper, the belonging elected (major) parties have been deciphered as well. Invalid votes count as non votes in the financing of the parties. The parties do not receive any money for them. As the party's financing is capped and the total sum is regularly being utilised, the discrepancy of valid votes for parties who take part in financing is practically low. A small amount of invalid votes is generally beneficial for parties with above average fund raising (membership fees included) seeing that more money remains in the bonus fund. = Electoral threshold = Seats in the German Bundestag distributed by regional lists are only given to parties passing a five percent electoral threshold of the federally valid second votes. Alternatively, if a party wins at least three constituencies, a party still gains seats by proportional representation according to the number of second votes they received. Those second votes for parties that meet neither requirement will not be taken into account for the distribution of seats among the rest of the parties. Parties who qualify for proportional representation in this manner are recognized as party groups, as a party must win at least five percent of the vote to qualify as a full parliamentary party, or Fraktion. The three-constituency rule favours those smaller parties with a regional stronghold. For example, the German Party (DP) only won 3.3% of the second vote, but was able to win 15 seats by electing ten members from constituency seats, mostly in the party's heartland of Lower Saxony. In 1957, the DP won 3.4% of the second vote, but elected six members from constituency seats, enabling them to send 17 members to the Bundestag. The three-constituency rule was not used again until 1994, when the PDS won four direct mandates in Berlin, enabling them to send 30 delegates to the Bundestag, despite the fact that they had only 4.4 percent of the second vote. The clause is meant to minimise the risk of party fragmentation, which partially caused the incapacitation of the Reichstag in the Weimar Republic. The clause is not explicitly mentioned in the constitution as this could cause a conflict with the fundamental principle of equal votes, which states that each vote must have equal weight. However, the general consensus is that the clause is important for the stability of the party system, the capacity of the parliament and the government and overall for the political stability of the state. Thus, a balance must be achieved between the two existing constitutional objectives. The Federal Constitutional Court approves of the threshold clause, arguing that it is allowed to violate a constitutional principle within certain limits, if this is essential to achieve a more important constitutional objective such as the adherence to a principle of electoral law. Because of this, the Federal Constitutional Court allows the threshold clause to be maximally five percent. Thus the legislator has no possibility of increasing it. National minority parties, such as the SSW, which last ran for parliamentary election in 1961, are now freed from the electoral threshold due to the fact that under Constitutional Law it is imperative that minorities are protected. This special regulation however does not necessarily apply to a Turkish party, as the Turkish do not yet enjoy the status of a national minority in Germany, unlike the Danish party in Schleswig-Holstein, the SSW, or the Sorbs in Saxony. = Distribution of seats = At first, the number of successful independent direct candidates and the successful direct candidates whose party did not make it into the German Bundestag is taken from the total number of 598 mandates. In the parliamentary election of 2002, both direct candidates were members of the PDS party. Only in the parliamentary election of 1949 were there successful independent direct candidates. The remaining proportional mandates (596 seats in the election of 2002 and all of the 598 seats in 2005) are distributed among the parties which have obtained at least five per cent, or three direct mandates according to the results of all second votes, in the Sainte-Lagu√´/Schepers procedure (before the federal election in 2009 it was the Hare-Niemeyer procedure). Afterwards, the obtained proportional mandates of each party are distributed among the candidates‚Äô lists of the Bundesl√§nder, according to the number of their second votes in the respective Bundesl√§nder, by following the same procedure. The outcome of this procedure shows how many proportional mandates each party has gained in each Bundesland. The candidates who have achieved a seat in the Bundestag can then be identified. At first, the victorious direct candidates of a party obtain their mandates in a Bundesland. Within the Bundesl√§nder, in which the number of achieved direct mandates of one party is smaller than the number of achieved proportional mandates, the difference is settled by list mandates i.e. candidates of the Bundesl√§nder list in order of appearance, whereas candidates who have already gained a direct mandate in their district (not matter which Bundesland) are simply left out. If a party in a Bundesland receives more direct mandates than proportional mandates, all the successful candidates in constituencies gain additional seats in the Bundestag. These seats are called excess mandates. Consequently, the Bundestag becomes larger by the amount of additionally gained seats. Starting with the 2013 election, other parties receive leveling seats. In recent years, the number of excess mandates was 13 in 1998, 5 in 2002, 16 in 2005, 24 in 2009 and 33 in 2013. In 2017, after the formula was adjusted somewhat, there were 111 overhang and levelling excess mandates. In theory, the maximum possible number of excess mandates is 299. This would occur if all 299 direct mandates are gained by parties who do not receive enough second votes to gain proportional mandates. If a delegate of the Bundestag who was elected in a constituency in which his or her political party gained a number of excess mandates resigns, his or her seat remains free and cannot be used by the following candidate on the party's list. At the beginning of the 2002 legislative period the Bundestag consisted of 603 delegates. When SPD delegate Anke Hartnagel died and the head of SPD in Thuringia, Christoph Matschie, resigned, this regulation was enacted. As a consequence, the 15th Bundestag consisted of 601 members.  Classification and assessment of the system  The Bundestag, Germany's parliament, is elected according to the principle of proportional representation. In some cases, this system is also referred to as mixed member proportional representation. This, however, is incorrect considering the fact that the mandates gained directly in each federal state are compared to the number of second vote mandates and any differences are compensated with candidates from the party's list at the state level, if, according to the principle of proportional representation, a party gains more second vote mandates than direct mandates. Therefore, it is more accurate to call it additional member system. However, the so-called mixing election system can be described as parallel voting whereas a certain number of representatives is elected through one of the systems and the other independent representatives are elected through the other system without any mandates being taken over by both of the systems. Voting for the Bundestag is complicated. In particular, the importance of the second vote is sometimes underestimated. However, the voting system combines many of the advantages of both the plurality and the proportional voting system. Time has proven that this voting system mainly allows for a proportional distribution of seats, stable governments, change of governments, the possibility of new parties joining the parliament, and in comparison to the Reichstag, the precursor parliament of the Bundestag in the Weimar Republic, it allows for a parliament capable of acting. Presently, the big parties are not considering introducing a majority voting system like they did at the beginning of the first grand coalition in 1966. However, there has been major criticism of the federal election system. The overhang seats are problematic in the sense that they distort the proportional representation (resulting from the second votes). The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany has found that this distinctive feature is compatible with the legislator's will of ensuring a regionally balanced composition of the Bundestag. Nevertheless, one consequence of the overhang seats is the paradoxical possibility that a party may receive more seats in the Bundestag by receiving fewer second votes in certain states, or fewer seats if they receive more votes. On July 3, 2008, the Federal Constitutional Court declared the possibility of this so-called \\"negative vote weight\\" (\\"negatives Stimmgewicht\\") to be unconstitutional,https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2008/07/cs20080703_2bvc000107.html and reforms were implemented in May 2013 that sharply reduced this possibility. = Discussions about the implementation of a majority voting system = By the end of 1955 the CDU/CSU (political union of the parties of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union) together with the German party (in German: Deutsche Partei (DP)) brought forward a first draft outlining a possible majority voting system. According to this draft 60 percent of the mandates were supposed to be determined by majority votes and only 40 percent according to proportional representation. Adenauer's attempt to end the CDU/CSU's dependence on the FDP (the Liberal Democratic Party) as well as to limit the SPD's (the Social Democratic Party) prospects of getting elected was unsuccessful. When the first Grand Coalition (1966‚Äì1969) took office, there were strong tendencies within both major parties, CDU and SPD, to abandon proportional representation which had existed/had been applied since the foundation of the German Federal Republic in 1949. Instead, they suggested implementing the majority vote system. These plans were even part of the coalition agreement. The smaller FDP which has no chance of winning the majority in an election district, protested because the implementation of this voting system would have threatened its further existence. Ultimately, however, the introduction of the majority vote system failed because large parts of the SPD were convinced that it would not have meant better prospects of power. Paul L√ºcke (CDU), Federal Minister of the Interior, resigned from office on April 2, 1968. Since then there have been no more attempts to introduce the majority vote system in Germany. = Forecast = The paradoxes which occur with the largest remainder method are avoided by the recent introduction of the Sainte-Lagu√´ method. The difficulty of \\"negative vote weight\\" (where a voter's choosing to vote for a party makes it less likely that that party will gain seats in parliament) still remain possible. But German lawmakers adopted reforms in May 2013 that sharply reduce this possibility, following a July 2008 decision of the Federal Constitutional Court declaring negative vote weight unconstitutional.  History  Election of the first German Bundestag (14 August 1949) ‚Äì The election system which was valid for the election of the Bundestag in 1949 has been changed significantly in the following decades. Because the Parliamentary Council couldn't agree on a written formulation of the voting system in the Grundgesetz, the Federal Election Law was ratified by the heads of government of the German states. The right to vote was granted from the age of 21, the right to be elected from the age of 25. The constitutional number of representatives counted 400, plus possible overhang seats and 19 Berlin representatives. The federal territory was divided into 242 electoral districts, each one having one direct candidate being elected according to the relative majority voting, which is still valid. As a result of two CDU overhang seats, the Bundestag of 1949 consisted of 402 representatives. Each German state formed its own electoral district. Consequently, the number of representatives of a state was determined in advance (excluding overhang seats). Accordingly, the five-percent hurdle and the Grundmandat-clause (one direct mandate was sufficient to join the Bundestag) were valid merely in the federal states. A single-vote system was used. Using this single vote, the voter elected both a state party list and a direct candidate of the same party from his electoral district. Therefore, the voter did not have the possibility to give separate, independent votes for the person or the direct candidate and the party or the list. The voter of an independent direct candidate had in comparison with the two-vote system of today not the possibility to vote a party, with the risk that his vote in a case of unsuccessfulness of the candidate was lost. In case a direct candidate resigned from the Bundestag, the corresponding electoral district had to hold a reelection. This happened fourteen times the first being the 1950 Kulmbach by-election. The proportional mandates (Proporzmandate) were allocated using the D'Hondt method which disadvantages small parties. These parties were further disadvantaged because the seats were allocated on a per state basis. Election of the 2nd German Bundestag (6 September 1953) ‚Äì In 1953 for the first time, a law (Bundeswahlgesetz) designed by the German Bundestag was the basis for the federal elections. This law contained some mayor alterations compared to the former election law: The dual-vote system with the respective possibility of vote splitting was introduced. In order to pass the electoral threshold, the party needed to receive a minimum of 5% of all second votes. Although the threshold was overruled for parties of national minorities, the S√ºdschleswigsche Landesverband (SSW) was not able to re-enter into Parliament. The number of proportional seats increased from 400 to 484, while the 242 electoral districts were maintained. Consequently, the Bundestag is equally represented by seats voted directly as well as via second vote, disregarding additional second vote mandates that have resulted from overhang seats. The number of Berlin's parliament members increased from 19 to 22. In the case of a direct candidate withdrawing from the Bundestag, a new election in his voting district was no longer necessary. Instead, the candidate being next in the state's list of candidates (\\"Landesliste‚Äú) would substitute the candidate. Election of the 3rd Bundestag (5 September 1957) ‚Äì Today's electoral law is basically the same as it used to be in 1957. The two-stage distribution of seats connected with states' canditates lists was introduced, which brought along the problem of negative vote weight. At the same time, the disadvantage of smaller parties was clearly reduced with the D'Hondt method. The Grundmandatsklausel, which says that a party needs at least 5% of the second votes to get any seat in the Bundestag, was modified: from now on at least three direct mandates were needed to overcome this clause. Since the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany on January 1, 1950, five electoral districts were added to the 242 already existing districts and the number of the mandates distributed by proportion was raised from 484 to 494. The absentee ballot was introduced as well. Election of the 5th Bundestag (19 September 1965) The electoral districts were rearranged, the number was increased from 247 to 248. Accordingly, the number of mandates distributed by proportion was raised from 494 to 496. Election of the 7th Bundestag (19 November 1972) By changing article 38 (2) of the Basic Law in 1970 the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 and the legal age to be eligible for election was adapted to the voting age, which was 21 at that time. Before that, one had to be 25 to stand for election. Election of the 8th German Bundestag (3 October 1976) When the change of sec. 2 BGB (German Civil Code) came into effect on January 1, 1975, the age of consent was lowered from 21 to 18 years. This means that since the election of 1976 citizens have the right to vote and to run for office at the age of 18. Election of the 11th German Bundestag (25 January 1987) Since the German federal election in 1987, the largest remainder method, which is neutral towards the size of the parties, has been applied instead of the D'Hondt method. The discrimination of/against small parties when distributing mandates (Proporzmandate) could hereby be completely abolished. Because of paradoxes that occur in the largest remainder method, the danger of negative vote weight expanded to all federal states, even to those without overhang seats. The voting right for Germans living abroad was introduced during this election. Election of the 12th German Bundestag ( 2 December 1990) Briefly before the Bundestagswahl of 1990, the Federal Constitutional Court decided that the situation of the recently reunited Germany showed a special case. An electoral threshold for the entire election district was unconstitutional. For this reason, a party had to receive at least 5% of the second votes either in the old federal territory including West-Berlin or in the new federal territory in order to win seat in the German Bundestag (Lower House of German Parliament). This special regulation was only valid for the elections in 1990. In the federal states that were formerly part of Eastern Germany, including Berlin, 80 constituencies were added. Because of this, the number of constituencies increased to 328, the number of proportional mandates to 656. Another consequence of German reunification was the abolition of a special regulation for West Berlin. This regulation prescribed that the Berlin City Parliament elected 22 representatives into the Bundestag on the day of the federal election. Election of the 15th German Bundestag (22 September 2002) ‚Äì For the election of the Bundestag in 2002, the number of constituencies was reduced from 328 to 299, as was the number of proportional mandates (from 656 to 598). Election of the 17th German Bundestag (27 September 2009) ‚Äì For the 2009 election of the Bundestag, the Hare- Niemeyer method was replaced by the Sainte-Lagu√´/Schepers method. For the first time, parties could no longer nominate candidates who were members of other parties. The circle of Germans living abroad who are entitled to vote was extended.  References  * Erhard H.

The war had started when Sweden on French initiative attacked Brandenburg-Prussia. Denmark got involved as part of the anti-Franco-Swedish alliance, occupied the Swedish dominions in northern Germany, incorporated the Swedish ally Holstein-Gottorp, won naval supremacy in the Baltic Sea and recovered some of her Scandinavian provinces lost in the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Since 1678, France divided the anti-Franco-Swedish alliance by concluding separate peace treaties with its members in the Treaties of Nijmegen. Strengthened by the outcome of these treaties, France strove to relieve her Swedish ally. French military pressure first forced Brandenburg- Prussia into the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), depriving Denmark of her most important ally. Just after this had caused Danish and Swedish diplomats to start negotiations in Lund, French forces crossed into Danish territory and forced Denmark to accept the French-dictated Treaty of Fontainebleau (1679), that called for restoring to Sweden all her pre-war possessions and Holstein-Gottorp to its duke. Dano-Swedish negotiations in Lund continued, and the final treaty did not only confirm and detail the terms of Fontainebleau, but also included a secret alliance outlined primarily by Gyllenstierna. The alliance, fragile from the beginning, broke apart in the following year after Gyllenstierna's death. Background In 1678/79, Louis XIV of France ended a series of conflicts by the Treaties of Nijmegen, most notably the Franco-Dutch War.Goubert (1991), p.128 These treaties were favourable for France, who continued to maintain and use her 100,000 troopsGoubert (1991), p. 133 and her status as a great power to expand (pursuing so-called r√©unions)Goubert (1991), p. 134 and intervene in the Scanian War.Frost (2000), p. 213 Christian V of Denmark This war had started when France pressed her Swedish ally to attack her adversary Brandenburg- Prussia in 1674.Frost (2000), p. 210 This move, though performed half- hartedly, succeeded in the withdrawal of the main Brandenburg-Prussian army from the French border in order to confront Sweden. The price paid by Sweden for relieving Brandenburgian pressure on France was a series of lost battles from Fehrbellin to Stralsund, which expelled Sweden from her Pomeranian dominion.Frost (2000), pp. 210-212 Furthermore, the Swedish attack on Brandenburg prompted Denmark-Norway, like Brandenburg-Prussian a member of an anti-French alliance, to enter the war.Frost (2000), p. 212 Christian Albrecht of Holstein-Gottorp Before attacking Sweden directly, Christian V of Denmark expelled the Swedish ally Christian Albrecht (or Albert) from Holstein- Gottorp. Christian Albrecht had allied with Sweden after he was outmaneuvered by Christian V in a conflict over the succession in Oldenburg, which emerged after Anton G√ºnther of Oldenburg's death in 1667.Hille (ADB) In 1675, Christian V's attack forced Christian Albrecht to unite his duchy with Denmark in the Treaty of Rendsburg and exile to Hamburg. Later in 1675, the Danish armies sacked Swedish Wismar and Bremen-Verden, participated in the Brandenburg-Prussian campaign in Swedish Pomerania, and started a naval offensive that two years later put an end to Swedish supremacy in the Baltic Sea in the Battle of K√∏ge. Danish recovery of the provinces lost to Sweden in the Second Northern War however proved difficult, and after the Danish invasion in June 1676 and the subsequent setback in Lund, neither Denmark nor Sweden was able to gain the upper hand in the Scanian theater. Negotiations, Fontainebleau After Louis XIV had divided the anti-French coalition and settled with most of his adversaries in Nijmegen, his armies crossed the Rhine to relieve his hard-pressed ally Charles XI of Sweden.Holborn (1982), p.79 The invasion of the Brandenburg-Prussian Rhine provinces in May 1679 forced Frederick William I to withdraw from the war and agree to the French-dictated terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Deprived of her allies, Denmark had no choice but to settle for peace. Jens Juel Negotiations started in June 1679 in the Scanian town of Lund.Rystad (2001), p. 117 The Danish plenipotentiaries were Anton of Aldenburg and Jens Juel, while Johan G√∂ransson Gyllenstierna and Frans Joel √ñrnstedt negotiated for Sweden. Yet, at about the same time the negotiations started, the French army had crossed into the Danish duchies and marched on Danish Oldenburg.Nolan (2008, p. 421 French pressure left Denmark no choice but to return to the status quo ante bellum in the Treaty of Fontainebleau on 23 August (O.S.) / 2 September 1679, which restored all conquests made during the war to Sweden in turn for a \\"paltry indemnity\\". Le Roi Soleil, Louis XIV The treaty, concluded by Danish, French and Swedish envoys in Louis XIV's palace of Fontainebleau just south of Paris, was written in French and Latin.R√©my-Limousin (1997), p. 76 The plenipotentiaries' leeway was limited, as Louis XIV had decreed in August that the settlement was to be a \\"total restitution\\" of pre-war Swedish territory to his ally, \\"the preservation of [whose] interests is no less dear to me than of my own\\".Upton (1998), p. 27 Rying (1981) summarized the treaty as follows: > \\"Denmark would come empty-handed out of a war with France as an enemy. Ten > cannons as trophies from each of the captured fortresses were all that > Denmark got out of this war, that was [...] lost at Fontainebleau.\\"Rying > (1981), p. 180 The validity of the treaties of Westphalia (1648), Roskilde (1658) and Copenhagen (1660) was confirmed, and Christian Albrecht restored in Holstein- Gottorp.Lange (1996), p. 250 Lund The final settlement at Lund, signed on 16 September (O.S.) / 26 September 1679, detailed and amended Fontainebleau. French pressure assured that the terms of Fontainebleau were confirmed, as was Sweden's exemption from the Sound Dues. Besides areas in Sk√•neland, the Danish-occupied territories which were to be returned also included the Swedish port of Wismar in Mecklenburg and northern Swedish Pomerania with the isle of R√ºgen. R√ºgen was to be returned on 20 October 1679 (Article VI), while Wismar was to be returned only after Denmark had received the agreed-on contributions (Article VII).Asmus (2003), p. 211 Johan G√∂ransson Gyllenstierna In addition to these openly proclaimed articles, the treaty included secret paragraphs negotiated by Johan G√∂ransson Gyllenstierna.Treasure (1985), p. 501 They outlined a strategy of mutual assistance, which Gyllenstierna understood was the only way the Scandinavian countries were able to compete with France and Brandenburg-Prussia. The alliance was to last ten years.Orfield (1953/2002), p. 150 Gyllenstierna had come to power during the war, and by 1679 controlled Sweden's foreign policyUpton (1998), p. 92 to a point that he was given \\"free hand\\" by Charles XI in negotiating the treaty.Upton (1998), p. 93 His goal was to free the resources bound by the continuous Dano-Swedish hostilities, assert common control of the Baltic Sea, advance to a more favourable commercial position with respect to the Dutch Republic, and be able to negotiate better terms with France with respect to military alliances. Yet, as Charles XI and other leading Swedish figures, he was also hostile towards Denmark, and had proposed to eliminate Denmark in a joint Franco-Swedish attack just prior to the negotiations. While his motives remain speculative, the secret alliance as laid out in the treaty included several co-operations in northern Germany, joint negotiations with France, and a joint position regarding the Baltic Sea trade. A defensive alliance was also concluded, but included in the public part of the treaty. The secret articles of Lund were revealed only in 1870. Consequences While Charles XI of Sweden married Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark and the conciliatory Gyllenstierna became governor of contested Scania in 1679, his death in 1680 left Bengt Oxenstierna in charge of Sweden's foreign relations.Scott (1988), p. 214 Oxenstierna reversed Gyllenstierna's policies, instead he started bending the terms of Lund already in his first year in office by ratifying a Dutch-Swedish treaty without consulting Denmark,Upton (1998), p. 94 and thereafter allied with various European powers to force Denmark out of Schleswig in 1689. The early 1690s saw a short period of Dano-Swedish rapprochement, when the alliance of Lund was renewed and extended in 1690 and 1693 for fear of the Maritime Powers, resulting in the Scandinavian states' first armed neutrality. Yet in 1700, the countries were at war again.

During this period, in 1882 he took the dr.med. degree on the thesis Om den ved Trigeminusan√¶sthesi forekommende Hornhindelidelses V√¶sen og Aarsager. The ailments he described often occurred in leprosy patients. B√∏ckmann had spent a year from 1880 to 1881 as a physician at a lepra institution. His was the first Norwegian doctoral thesis in medicine whose research had been conducted outside the proximity of the University of Kristiania. Also, in Bergen he involved himself in the local medical society, Bergens Medicinske Selskap. In 1884 he co-founded the journal Medicinsk Revue, which existed until 1939. Career In 1886, B√∏ckmann immigrated to the United States, reportedly seeking \\"grander conditions\\". He settled in St. Paul, Minnesota, and socialized with the many Norwegian immigrants in that area. In 1887 he invited Gerhard Armauer Hansen from Norway, who resided and researched in B√∏ckmann's premises. He had a practice as an ophthalmologist and surgeon, and from 1898 to 1908 he was a professor of clinical ophthalmology at Hamline University. He presided over the local Ramsey County Medical Society in 1899, and co-founded the journal St. Paul Medical Journal in 1898. In the 1890s he invented two types of autoclave, one of them stationary and the other a portable model for military use. He participated in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, leading a field hospital in Jacksonville, Florida for three months. He also invented a new type of catgut, which came into mass production in 1901. In 1897, the library of the Ramsey County Medical Society was established when B√∏ckmann donated the profits from his inventions. He also guaranteed the St. Paul Medical Journal financially. In 1901 he donated a book collection to the Ramsey County Medical Society library. He decided that proceedings from the sale of the catgut business should be used for a foundation to fund the library. The sale took place long after his death in 1959, and the library was named after B√∏ckmann. An inventory of the papers of B√∏ckmann is maintained at the Minnesota Historical Society. The materials, which are written in both English and Norwegian, include correspondence, certificates and awards, photographs, clippings, and authored papers. B√∏ckmann also led a fundraiser among Norwegian-Americans at the University of Kristiania centennial anniversary in 1911. For this, he received an honorary degree there. He was also proclaimed a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, having been a Knight of the Order since 1907.

The constituents of the parish consist of the villages of Great Thirkleby, Little Thirkleby and the scattered hamlet of Osgodby. The similarly named medieval settlement of Thirkleby Manor is in the parish of Kirby Grindalythe, Ryedale district. The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was 266. History The Domesday Book mentions the village of Thirkleby as Turchilebi in the Yarlestre hundred and belonging to the Coxwold manor. There were 54 villagers with the land consisting of ploughed fields and woodland. At the time of the Norman invasion, the lands belonged to Kofse but soon afterwards were granted to Hugh, son of Baldric. Soon after, the manor was in the hands of the Mowbray family and followed the descent of the manor of Thirsk until the 16th century. A mesne lordship was held in the parish by Robert de Buscy in the 12th century, with some land granted to Byland Abbey. The Buscy family held this land until at least 1348. Other land owners in the 12th century in the manor were the Meynell family. Some of their land seemed to have been granted by marriage to the de Burton family, who also held lands in West Harlsey. The greater manor passed from the Buscy family to the Crown following their involvement in the 1322 uprisings. They were acquired by Sir Thomas Ughtred in 1361. The manor was sold to Sir Roger Fulthorpe in 1383 and remained in the family until the late 16th century when it was seized by the Crown. It was subsequently sold to the Earl of Warwick who sold it in turn to William Frankland. It remained in the Frankland family, though not always through direct line of succession, until the late 19th century. The lesser manor passed from the de Burton family to Marmaduke Darell in 1363 and thereafter followed the inheritance of the manor of Sessay. The lands that make up Osgodby were those that were granted to the church. The toponymy is derived from the Danish personal name of Thorkel or Thirkel suffixed with by to give the meaning of Thorkel's farm. Thirkleby Hall used to stand to the west of Great Thirkleby and was built between 1780 and 1785 for Sir Thomas Frankland, 6th Baronet and was situated in around of grounds. At the end of the First World War, the estate was without any heir and was auctioned off, except for the hall which did not find a buyer until 1927 when it was dismantled entirely. The grounds are now used for holiday accommodation in the form of cottages and static caravans. Prisoner of war camp number 108 was built at Sandhill (on Low Road at the southern edge of Little Thirkleby) as a working camp for German prisoners during the Second World War. It has been used as a pig farm for many years but the water tower and many of the buildings have survived. A Roman fort was discovered at Thirkleby in 2018, through the study of aerial photography. The fort is considered to date to the Flavian period on the basis of its layout. Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Stillington electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the White Horse ward of Hambleton District Council. Geography View of Great Thirkleby towards The White Horse at Kilburn The parish is in size. The parish consists of the villages of Great (or High) Thirkleby, Little (or Low) Thirkleby and the scattered hamlet of Osgodby. Thirkleby Beck divides Great and Little Thirkleby and runs south as part of the tributary system of the River Swale. The A19 road passes north westward through the southern part of the parish. The two villages are linked by Arden Bridge which is a Grade II listed structure probably built by John Carr in the 18th century. The nearest settlements to the centre point of the two villages are Bagby to the north west, Kilburn to the east, Carlton Husthwaite to the south east and Hutton Sessay to the south.  Demography  In 1881, the UK Census recorded the population as 261. In 2001 the UK Census recorded a population of 224 of which 47.8% were male and 52.2% were female and 191 were over the age of sixteen years. The 2011 UK Census recorded a population of 266, of which 47.4% were male and 52.6% were female and 232 were over the age of sixteen years. Population density was recorded as 0.2 per hectare. Religion All Saints, Great Thirkleby, Thirsk, North Yorkshire The church is a Grade II* listed building, dedicated to All Saints. It was designed by Victorian architect Edward Buckton Lamb and built in 1851 for Lady Frankland-Russell of Thirkleby Park, in memory of her husband Robert. The burial vault of the earlier church was retained but the fine pews were moved to the church of St Andrew's at Blubberhouses (another Frankland- Russell estate church also designed by E.B. Lamb). All Saints has several Frankland memorials and other monumental inscriptions, including a fine piece by the sculptor John Flaxman. The previous church was rebuilt in 1722 on the site of the original 12th-century building.

His ruling in Marie Louise v. Marot was cited as precedent by dissenting U.S. Supreme Court Justice John McLean in the 1856 landmark Dred Scott v. Sandford case. Early life Mathews was born in Augusta County, Virginia, on September 30, 1774, the son of a planter and Revolutionary War officer, George Mathews and his wife, Polly. The elder Mathews would later serve twice as Governor of Georgia. In 1785, the elder Mathews moved himself and his whole family to Wilkes County, Georgia, to land that today is in Oglethorpe County. Mathews returned to Virginia for his education at Liberty Hall Academy (which later became Washington and Lee University). He originally set out to become a physician but was persuaded by his father to study law under his brother, John Mathews, in Augusta, Georgia. He married Harriet Flowers in 1809 and they resided near St. Francisville, Louisiana, at her family's Butler Greenwood Plantation.National Park Service: Butler-Greenwood Plantation, http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/louisiana/but.htm, retrieved 27 Aug 2009. Butler Greenwood Plantation George and Harriett Mathews raised indigo, cotton, sugar cane, and corn on the plantation, shipping the crops from their own dock on Bayou Sara and extending their land holdings to include a sugar plantation in Lafourche Parish that, according to Lewis Gray's figures, placed them among the top 9% of sugar planters in the state in the 1850s. The Mathews owned slaves, and used their labor on their plantation. In an 1826 report, George Mathews relayed in family correspondence that his slaves in the field were picking 126 pounds of cotton, each. Career on the bench In 1804 Mathews was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson to be judge of the Superior Court of the newly created Territory of Mississippi. He served for two years on that court before being appointed judge of the Superior Court for the Territory of Orleans in 1806. When Louisiana became a state in 1813, the territorial courts were replaced by a new Supreme Court. Mathews was appointed by Governor William C.C. Claiborne as judge of that new high court on February 23, 1813. He served alongside Judges Dominic Augustin Hall, Pierre Derbigny and Francois Xavier Martin. He reputedly learned both French and Spanish as much of the law of the State of Louisiana was rooted in the traditions of the land's previous colonial overlords and many lawyers spoke one of the two languages but not English. US Supreme Court Justice John McLean, who relied on Mathews' precedent for his dissent from the Court ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford = Dred Scott v. Sandford precedent = In the early 1830s, a Louisiana family went to France with their young slave girl, Josephine Louise. When the family returned home, the slave girl's mother sued to obtain a declaration of immediate emancipation as a result of the girl being transported to a country that did not recognize the institution of slavery. The 1835 case, Marie Louise v. Marot (1836) was heard by the Louisiana state district court and appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Court held that a slave who is taken to a territory prohibitive of slavery cannot be again reduced to slavery on returning to a territory allowing of slavery. Mathews, speaking for the court, stated that \\"[b]eing free for one moment...it was not in the power of her former owner to reduce her again to slavery.\\"\\"Champion of Civil Rights: Judge John Minor Wisdom\\".

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The authors of the Buildings of England series describe it as a \\"house of considerable size and panache\\". History The house was built by the Chester architect John Douglas for his own use. It was built in the 1890s and, although bearing the date 1896, its service wing was never completed. Because of its large size and prominent position it was popularly known as \\"Douglas' Castle\\" or \\"Douglas' Folly\\". Douglas lived in the house from about 1901 until his death in 1911. Following this, his son Sholto continued to live in there but had left it by 1918. It became a girls' school, Walmoor College. A 1935 publication shows it as Hampton House School, Walmoor Hill, a boarding and day school for boys under the headmastership of a D.P. Saunders-Griffiths, M.A. (Oxon.). It was later the headquarters of the Cheshire Fire Brigade. Its use by the fire service ended in 1997. Architecture The house is built in red sandstone with a grey-green slate roof. It is Elizabethan in style and has a T-shaped plan. The main wing is elaborate and overlooks the river to the west; the unfinished servants' wing is simpler and looks to the north. The entrance faces the east. The entrance porch has two storeys with an arched entrance and an oriel window above it. The room above the porch was used by Douglas as an oratory or chapel. To the left is a squat three-storey tower and between the two is an octagonal corbelled stair-turret. To the right of the entrance porch the house continues for two bays leading to the servants' wing at right angles. These are in two storeys with mullioned windows. The west front has a massive appearance with a three storey bay to the north. This has mullioned and transomed canted windows, a crenellated parapet and a pyramidal roof. To its right is an octagonal four-storey crenellated tower. To the south of this the house continues for three bays in two storeys and at the south is a three- storey bay, again with mullioned and transomed canted windows, but with a plain parapet. The monograms \\"JD\\" and \\"STD\\" (for Sholto Theodore Douglas) appear on the building.

History Started in 2002, the band set about creating heavy, groovy, noise metal. The band took their name from the construction term Rolled Steel Joist, an 'in-joke' to referencing \\"a good support or a piece of heavy metal\\". Their debut EP, The Day After, was released in September 2002 and paved the way forward, gaining worldwide sales through the band's website and earning them a loyal fanbase. Their high-energy live shows landed the band supports with Funeral for a Friend, Raging Speedhorn and Orange Goblin. 2004 saw RSJ sign to Hangmans Joke Recordings and released their second EP, Blueprint for a Brighter Future. The EP featured the band's debut promo video for the track 'Reborn' and saw their first small screen appearance on British music channel, Scuzz TV. The EP received critical acclaim with Nuts magazine hailing the band as \\"the heaviest band to come out of the UK in a long time\\". In April 2004, a member of Bullet for My Valentine's management team saw RSJ play a show in Reading and were offered a support slot to with American metal-core band, Unearth, at the Camden Barfly in London in June of that year. In 2005, the band signed to British independent label Copro Records and saw their first album Reflections in B Minor. Produced by Dave Chang (Earthtone9), the 12-track album received further reviews and gave the track \\"Dystonia\\" an inclusion on Metal Hammer's monthly cover disc. Australian grindcore band, The Berzerker, chose RSJ as one of the rotating support bands for their 2006 14-day UK trek for their 'World of Lies' album, again giving flawless reviews of their energetic stage shows and leading to further articles in Metal Hammer and Kerrang!. In autumn of that year, the band went back into the studio to write material for their next album, Gain to Nothing, which was released the following year. In October 2007, the band won the Glasswerk \\"Best New Metal Band\\" award, which automatically earned them a headline slot on the Scuzz TV stage at 2008's Bloodstock festival. The band took the remainder of 2007 to write new material. Shortly after their appearance at Bloodstock, drummer Rich Hardy left the band. A month later, RSJ won the \\"15 Minutes Of Fame\\" competition which was hosted by Metal Hammer, Scuzz TV and the Radio One Rock Show - which won the band an opening slot on Slayer's third \\"Unholy Alliance\\" tour alongside Amon Amarth, Mastodon and Trivium. Dom White of The Family Ruin, filled in while the band searched for a new drummer. In December, Greg Parsons was named as RSJ's new drummer and the band set out to write new material for their as-yet-untitled third album. In 2010 the band opened the J√§germeister Stage at Sonisphere Festival, Knebworth, England. They entered the studio shortly after to record demos for their as-yet-untitled third album. The band played a few shows during the course of 2011 including opening up for Will Haven on their single UK show that at the O2 Islington Academy in London. 2012 saw RSJ's debut appearances at both Hammerfest and Hard Rock Hell: Road Trip to Ibiza festivals. Spring and Summer 2013 saw the band being invited back to Hammerfest and HRH: Road Trip to Ibiza festivals for the second time. In November, they were announced as main support for American Headcharge during their \\"Shoot\\" tour. While on the road, the band released their third album Higgs Boson.

Origin During the U.S. Civil War, Joseph Rider experimented with several breech loading weapon designs. In 1865, he was issued the first patent for what would evolve into the Remington rolling block action.U.S. Patent 45,797 The Remingtons continued to invest in Rider's work, and met with Ordnance Department officials in the hope of interesting them in this new design. The U.S. Navy Ordnance Department became interested in the design, and purchased several different models of rifles from 1867 through 1869. Field trials of these various rifles yielded mostly positive results.\\"The history of Remington Firearms\\" By Roy M. Marcot\\"The Guns That Won the West: Firearms on the American Frontier, 1848-1898\\" By John Walter In 1869, the Navy Bureau of Ordnance tested many different weapons, and settled on the .50 caliber Remington rolling block for use by both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marines. Navy rifles were to be produced with bright barrels, and Marine barrels were to be browned.\\"The history of Remington Firearms\\" By Roy M. Marcot Production The U.S. Navy decided to order 10,000 rolling block rifles. These were to be manufactured at Springfield Armory. After lengthy discussions, it was decided that Springfield Armory would make the complete rifle, and would pay Remington and Sons a $1.00 royalty for all rifles produced.\\"The history of Remington Firearms\\" By Roy M. Marcot After the rifles were produced, Navy inspectors realized that the rear sights had been positioned incorrectly, and were dangerously close to the chamber, making the weapon unsafe for use. All 10,000 rifles were rejected, and were subsequently sold to Poultney and Trimble of Baltimore. These weapons were then exported to France for use during the Franco-Prussian War.\\"The Guns That Won the West: Firearms on the American Frontier, 1848-1898\\" By John Walter The sale of the defective rifles enabled enough funds to be recovered that the Navy Ordnance Department later ordered 12,000 model 1870 Type II rifles, which were just a minor improvement to the model 1870 and included changes such as the correction of the location of the rear sight.

Anne was a member of the House of Luxemburg.Anne de Luxembourg  Early life and family  Anne and her twin sister Elisabeth were born in 1323 in the small Bavarian border town of Cham, where their mother, Elisabeth of Bohemia, was living in exile. John financially supported his wife and daughters during their exile. Her mother returned to Bohemia in 1325 with Anne (the younger Elizabeth having died in 1324), but never regained her health after the return, dying from tuberculosis in 1330. Anne was a younger sister of: * Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor * Bonne of Bohemia, first wife of John II of France * Margaret of Bohemia, wife of Henry XIV, Duke of Bavaria * John Henry, Margrave of Moravia After his wife's death John married Beatrice of Bourbon. They had two children, Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg, and Bonne, who died young.  Marriage  Anne suffered two failed betrothals before her marriage. The first was to Ladislaus of Hungary, son of Charles I of Hungary and Elisabeth of Poland, but Ladislaus died in 1329. If Ladislaus had survived and the pair had married, Anne could have become Queen of Hungary. She was then betrothed to Louis VI the Roman. This betrothal ended because Louis's father, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, could have been excommunicated by the Pope. Anne was eventually married on 16 February 1335, to Otto, Duke of Austria. This was a second marriage for Otto; his first wife, Elizabeth of Bavaria, had died after bearing him two sons. Anne was seven years old at the time. The marriage lasted for eight years and resulted in a closer alliance between Anne's father and the Holy Roman Emperor, but Anne died at the age of fifteen in 1338, long before she and Otto could have children. Otto followed her in death shortly thereafter and was succeeded by his sons from his first marriage to Elisabeth of Bavaria.

This may involve blood tests, urine tests, DNA tests, other tests, or medical imaging. The benefits of screening in terms of cancer prevention, early detection and subsequent treatment must be weighed against any harms. Universal screening, also known as mass screening or population screening, involves screening everyone, usually within a specific age group. Selective screening identifies people who are known to be at higher risk of developing cancer, such as people with a family history of cancer. Screening can lead to false positive results and subsequent invasive procedures. Screening can also lead to false negative results, where an existing cancer is missed. Controversy arises when it is not clear if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks of the screening procedure itself, and any follow-up diagnostic tests and treatments. Screening tests must be effective, safe, well tolerated with acceptably low rates of false positive and false negative results. If signs of cancer are detected, more definitive and invasive follow-up tests are performed to reach a diagnosis. Screening for cancer can lead to cancer prevention and earlier diagnosis. Early diagnosis may lead to higher rates of successful treatment and extended life. However, it may also falsely appear to increase the time to death through lead time bias or length time bias. Medical uses The goal of cancer screening is to provide useful health information which can guide medical treatment. A good cancer screening is one which would detect when a person has cancer so that the person could seek treatment to protect their health. Good cancer screening would not be more likely to cause harm than to provide useful information. In general, cancer screening has risks and should not be done except with a medical indication. Different kinds of cancer screening procedures have different risks, but good tests share some characteristics. If a test detects cancer, then that test result should also lead to options for treatment. Good tests come with a patient explanation of why that person has high enough risk of cancer to justify the test. Part of the testing experience is for the health care provider to explain how common false positive results are so that the patient can understand the context of their results. If multiple tests are available, then any test should be presented along with other options. Risks Screening for cancer is controversial in cases when it is not yet known if the test actually saves lives. Screening can lead to substantial false positive result and subsequent invasive procedures. The controversy arises when it is not clear if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks of follow-up diagnostic tests and cancer treatments. Cancer screening is not indicated unless life expectancy is greater than five years and the benefit is uncertain over the age of 70. Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening. These factors include: *Possible harms from the screening test: Some types of screening tests, such as X-ray images, expose the body to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a small chance that the radiation in the test could cause a new cancer in a healthy person. Screening mammography, used to detect breast cancer, is not recommended to men or to young women because they are more likely to be harmed by the test than to benefit from it. Other tests, such as a skin check for skin cancer, have no significant risk of harm to the patient. A test that has high potential harms is only recommended when the benefits are also high. *The likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer: If the test is not sensitive, then it may miss cancers. If the test is not specific, then it may wrongly indicate cancer in a healthy person. All cancer screening tests produce both false positives and false negatives, and most produce more false positives. Experts consider the rate of errors when making recommendations about which test, if any, to use. A test may work better in some populations than others. The positive predictive value is a calculation of the likelihood that a positive test result actually represents cancer in a given individual, based on the results of people with similar risk factors. *The likelihood of cancer being present: Screening is not normally useful for rare cancers. It is rarely done for young people, since cancer is largely a disease found in people over the age of 50. Countries often focus their screening recommendations on the major forms of treatable cancer found in their population. For example, the United States recommends universal screening for colon cancer, which is common in the US, but not for stomach cancer, which is less common; by contrast, Japan recommends screening for stomach cancer, but not colon cancer, which is rarer in Japan. Screening recommendations depend on the individual's risk, with high-risk people receiving earlier and more frequent screening than low-risk people. *Possible harms from follow-up procedures: If the screening test is positive, further diagnostic testing is normally done, such as a biopsy of the tissue. If the test produces many false positives, then many people will undergo needless medical procedures, some of which may be dangerous. *Whether suitable treatment is available and appropriate: Screening is discouraged if no effective treatment is available. When effective and suitable treatment is not available, then diagnosis of a fatal disease produces significant mental and emotional harms. For example, routine screening for cancer is typically not appropriate in a very frail elderly person, because the treatment for any cancer that is detected might kill the patient. *Whether early detection improves treatment outcomes: Even when treatment is available, sometimes early detection does not improve the outcome. If the treatment result is the same as if the screening had not been done, then the only screening program does is increase the length of time the person lived with the knowledge that he had cancer. This phenomenon is called lead-time bias. A useful screening program reduces the number of years of potential life lost (longer lives) and disability-adjusted life years lost (longer healthy lives). *Whether the cancer will ever need treatment: Diagnosis of a cancer in a person who will never be harmed by the cancer is called overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is most common among older people with slow-growing cancers. Concerns about overdiagnosis are common for breast and prostate cancer. *Whether the test is acceptable to the patients:If a screening test is too burdensome, such as requiring too much time, too much pain, or culturally unacceptable behaviors, then people will refuse to participate. *Cost of the test: Some expert bodies, such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force, completely ignore the question of money. Most, however, include a cost-effectiveness analysis that, all else being equal, favors less expensive tests over more expensive tests, and attempt to balance the cost of the screening program against the benefits of using those funds for other health programs. These analyses usually include the total cost of the screening program to the healthcare system, such as ordering the test, performing the test, reporting the results, and biopsies for suspicious results, but not usually the costs to the individual, such as for time taken away from employment. *The extent to which a cancer is treatable: if a person has a low life expectancy or otherwise is in the end stages of a chronic condition, then such a patient may have a better life by ignoring the cancer even if one were found. If the diagnosis of cancer would not result in a change in care then cancer screening would not likely result in a positive outcome. Overdiagnosis in this case occurs, for example, in patients with end-stage renal disease and organizations recommend against cancer screening for such patients. By typeBreast cancer= Breast cancer screening is the medical screening of asymptomatic, apparently healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis. The goal of early detection is to find the cancer when it is treatable. A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, clinical breast exam, breast self-exam, thermography, tissue sampling and magnetic resonance imaging. Mammography is the method most commonly used for breast cancer screening for women who are 50 years and older. Risk factors for breast cancer are taken into consideration to decide if a screening test is needed and if so which is best for the person. =Cervical cancer= Microscope image of the cervical gland showing an area of high grade epithelial dysplasia. Cervical screening by the Pap test or other methods is highly effective at detecting and preventing cervical cancer, although there is a serious risk of overtreatment in young women up to the age of 20 or beyond, who are prone to have many abnormal cells which clear up naturally. There is a considerable range in the recommended age at which to begin screening around the world. According to the 2010 European guidelines for cervical cancer screening, the age at which to commence screening ranges between 20‚Äì30 years of age, \\"but preferentially not before age 25 or 30 years\\", depending on the burden of the disease in the population and the available resources. In the United States the rate of cervical cancer is 0.1% among women under 20 years of age, so the American Cancer Society as well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommend that screening begin at age 21, regardless of age at sexual initiation or other risk-related behaviors. For healthy women aged 21‚Äì29 who have never had an abnormal Pap smear, cervical cancer screening with cervical cytology (Pap smear) should occur every 3 years, regardless of HPV vaccination status. The preferred screening for women aged 30‚Äì65 is \\"co-testing\\", which includes a combination of cervical cytology screening and HPV testing, every 5 years. However, it is acceptable to screen this age group with a Pap smear alone every 3 years. In women over the age of 65, screening for cervical cancer may be discontinued in the absence of abnormal screening results within the prior 10 years and no history of CIN 2 or higher. =Bowel cancer= A bowel polyp that can be identified by sigmoidoscopy. Some polyps will develop into cancers if not removed. Screening for colorectal cancer, if done early enough, is preventive because almost all colorectal cancers originate from benign growths called polyps, which can be located and removed during a colonoscopy (see colonic polypectomy). The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy, in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years screening is not recommended. A new enzyme method for colorectal cancer screening is the M2-PK Test, which is able to detect bleeding and non-bleeding colorectal cancers and polyps. In 2008, Kaiser Permanente Colorado implemented a program that used automated calls and sends fecal immunochemical test kits to patients who are overdue for colorectal cancer screenings. The program has increased the proportion of all eligible members screened by 25 percent. Multi-Target Stool DNA Test (Cologuard) and Plasma SEPT9 DNA Methylation Test (Epi proColon) have been FDA-approved. In England, adults are screened biennially via faecal occult blood testing between the ages of 60 and 74 years, and recently extended to the ages from 50 to 74. =Prostate cancer= When screening for prostate cancer, the PSA test may detect small cancers that would never become life- threatening, but once detected will lead to treatment. This situation, called overdiagnosis, puts men at risk for complications from unnecessary treatment such as surgery or radiation. Follow up procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer (prostate biopsy) may cause side effects, including bleeding and infection. Prostate cancer treatment may cause incontinence (inability to control urine flow) and erectile dysfunction (erections inadequate for intercourse). As a result, in 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based screening for prostate cancer finding, \\"there is a very small potential benefit and significant potential harms\\" and concluding, \\"while everyone wants to help prevent deaths from prostate cancer, current methods of PSA screening and treatment of screen-detected cancer are not the answer.\\" More recently, Fenton's 2018 review (conducted for the USPSTF) focused on the two highest quality randomized control studies of the costs and benefits of PSA screening, and the findings illustrate the complex issues associated with cancer screening. Fenton reports that the screening of 1,000 men every four years for 13 years reduces mortality from prostate cancer by just one. More specifically, of those 1,000 men: 243 received an indication of cancer during PSA screening (most of whom then had a biopsy); of those, 3 had to be hospitalized for biopsy complications; 35 were diagnosed with prostate cancer (and thus the false alarm rate from the original PSA screening was >85%); of those 35, 3 avoided metastatic prostate cancer and 1 avoided death by prostate cancer while 9 developed impotence or urinary incontinence due to their treatment and 5 died due to prostate cancer despite being treated. In their 2018 recommendations, the USPSTF estimates that 20%-50% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer following a positive PSA screening have cancer that, even if not treated, would never grow, spread, or harm them Most North American medical groups recommend individualized decisions about screening, taking into consideration the risks, benefits, and the patients' personal preferences. =Lung cancer= Screening studies for lung cancer have only been done in high risk populations, such as smokers and workers with occupational exposure to certain substances. In the 2010s recommendations by medical authorities are turning in favour of lung cancer screening, which is likely to become more widely available in the advanced economies. In December 2013 the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed its long-standing recommendation that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer to the following: \\"The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults ages 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery\\". =Pancreatic cancer= Early detection of pancreatic cancer biomarkers was accomplished using SERS-based immunoassay approach. A SERS-base multiplex proteinbiomarker detection platform in a microfluidic chip to detect is used to detect several protein biomarkers to predict the type of disease and critical biomarkers and increase the chance of diagnosis between diseases with similar biomarkers (PC, OVC, and pancreatitis). It is generally agreed that general screening of large groups for pancreatic cancer is not at present likely to be effective, and outside clinical trials there are no programmes for this. The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging for those at high risk from inherited genetics, in line with other recommendations, which may also include CT. For screening, special CT scanning procedures may be used, such as multiphase CT scan. For average at-risk populations, routine screening for pancreatic cancer is currently not recommended. = Oral cancer= The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2013 found that evidence was insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral cancer in adults without symptoms by primary care providers. The American Academy of Family Physicians comes to similar conclusions while the American Cancer Society recommends that adults over 20 years who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined for cancer. The American Dental Association recommends that providers remain alert for signs of cancer during routine examinations. Oral cancer screening is also recommended by some groups of dental hygienists. =Other cancers= There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer, and bladder cancer. Routine screening is not recommended for testicular cancer, and ovarian cancer. ResearchWhole body imaging= Full body CT scans are available for cancer screening, but this type of medical imaging to search for cancer in people without clear symptoms can create problems such as increased exposure to ionizing radiation. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are not associated with a radiation risk, and MRI scans are being evaluated for their use in cancer screening. There is a significant risk of detection of what has been called incidentalomas - benign lesions that may be interpreted as a cancer and put patients at potential risk by undergoing follow-up procedures.

Although it is relatively short (about 100 km), the river is the third largest in Morocco with an average flow of 50 m¬≥/s. The Loukkos river's source is located in the Rif Mountains and flows into the Atlantic Ocean in the city of Larache; the city's port is on the river. The Loukkos river basin is 3,730 km¬≤ and contains one of the most fertile and productive agricultural lands in the country. One of the river's tributaries, Oued Makhazine, bears great historical importance since it witnessed one of the most decisive battles in the history of Morocco: the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir. In the battle on 4 August 1578, the joint army of deposed Moroccan monarch Abu Abdallah Mohammed II Saadi and his ally, King Sebastian of Portugal, was defeated by the army of the new Moroccan sultan from the same Saadi dynasty (who was also Abu Abdallah's uncle). The Lukkus is the largest river in northern Morocco. Although it is relatively short, this river carries the third largest water flow in Morocco. The river can cause great flooding in times of flood.

The site is located to the south of Kahramanmara≈ü. Covering 20 hectares, it is primarily a Halaf site of the 6th millennium BC and is the largest known settlement of that date. The site was investigated between 1995 and 2006 by a team from the University of Manchester and the University of California, Los Angeles. Work resumed in 2008, since when the excavation has been a joint project between the University of Manchester and the British Museum.  History of occupation  Halaf style ceramic pot from Kultepe, Azerbaijan, c. 6000 BC The site was certainly founded by the Ceramic Neolithic (c.6400BC) but earlier occupation may well be present. By the late Halaf almost all of the 20 hectare area of the site was probably occupied. Prehistoric occupation ended towards the end of the Halaf period (c.5450 BC). The site was reoccupied during the Hellenistic period and was occupied by a significant settlement during the first millennium AD. There is evidence for a church at this time, and a small Christian cemetery has been excavated. The excavated part of the prehistoric sequence starts at the transition between the Ceramic Neolithic and the Early Halaf (c.6100 BC) and continues until c.5450 BC. The Halaf occupation has been traced in a series of trenches across the site, providing rich evidence for both circular and rectangular buildings, ceramics, stone bowls, beads, figurines, chipped stone, bone tools and stamp seals, as well as a rich assemblage of animal bones and botanical remains. Excavation has concentrated on Operation I, on the summit of the southern mound. In the Early Halaf an east-west terrace was built up from red clay, with a series of occupational deposits to the south, and maintained in subsequent phases.  The Death Pit  Between 1997 and 2003 a highly complex burial was excavated, called the ‚ÄòDeath Pit‚Äô. This pit was more than 3m in diameter and about 1.5m deep, filled with layers of dis-articulated human and animal bones, broken pottery and other artifacts. The ceremonies that produce this feature probably took place over a few weeks and had several phases. The earliest layer of the Death Pit mainly contained animal bones, apparently from large-scale feasting. Later deposits included the remains of up to 40 people. The bodies had been heavily fragmented and cannibalism may have taken place. After the Death Pit was filled, it was covered in a thick layer of ash and marked with large posts. Further deposits of human remains were placed around its edges. Obsidian trade Recent research identified some Armenian obsidian at Domuztepe. Electron microprobe analysis and portable X-ray fluorescence were used. 15 artifacts from Domuztepe match :de:Pokr Arteni, a common obsidian source in Armenia. Thus, the Late Neolithic settlement of Domuztepe traded over a walking distance of 800 km. Four other obsidian sources from the Kura-Araxes basin were also identified at Domuztepe.

Temperature coefficient  5.4 √ó 10‚àí6 K‚àí1 } Lunarcrete, also known as \\"mooncrete\\", an idea first proposed by Larry A. Beyer of the University of Pittsburgh in 1985, is a hypothetical aggregate building material, similar to concrete, formed from lunar regolith, that would reduce the construction costs of building on the Moon.  Ingredients  Only comparatively small amounts of Moon rock have been transported to Earth, so in 1988 researchers at the University of North Dakota proposed simulating the construction of such a material by using lignite coal ash. Other researchers have used the subsequently developed lunar regolith simulant materials, such as JSC-1 (developed in 1994 and as used by Toutanji et al.). Some small-scale testing, with actual regolith, has been performed in laboratories, however. The basic ingredients for lunarcrete would be the same as those for terrestrial concrete: aggregate, water, and cement. In the case of lunarcrete, the aggregate would be lunar regolith. The cement would be manufactured by beneficiating lunar rock that had a high calcium content. Water would either be supplied from off the Moon, or by combining oxygen with hydrogen produced from lunar soil. Lin et al. used 40g of the lunar regolith samples obtained by Apollo 16 to produce lunarcrete in 1986. The lunarcrete was cured by using steam on a dry aggregate/cement mixture. Lin proposed that the water for such steam could be produced by mixing hydrogen with lunar ilmenite at 800 ¬∞C, to produce titanium oxide, iron, and water. It was capable of withstanding compressive pressures of 75 MPa, and lost only 20% of that strength after repeated exposure to vacuum. In 2008, Houssam Toutanji, of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Richard Grugel, of the Marshall Space Flight Center, used a lunar soil simulant to determine whether lunarcrete could be made without water, using sulfur (obtainable from lunar dust) as the binding agent. The process to create this sulfur concrete required heating the sulfur to 130-140 ¬∞C. After exposure to 50 cycles of temperature changes, from -27 ¬∞C to room temperature, the simulant lunarcrete was found to be capable of withstanding compressive pressures of 17MPa, which Toutanji and Grugel believed could be raised to 20MPa if the material were reinforced with silica (also obtainable from lunar dust).  Casting and production  There would need to be significant infrastructure in place before industrial scale production of lunarcrete could be possible. The casting of lunarcrete would require a pressurized environment, because attempting to cast in a vacuum would simply result in the water sublimating, and the lunarcrete failing to harden. Two solutions to this problem have been proposed: premixing the aggregate and the cement and then using a steam injection process to add the water, or the use of a pressurized concrete fabrication plant that produces pre-cast concrete blocks. Lunarcrete shares the same lack of tensile strength as terrestrial concrete. One suggested lunar equivalent tensioning material for creating pre-stressed concrete is lunar glass, also formed from regolith, much as fibreglass is already sometimes used as a terrestrial concrete reinforcement material. Another tensioning material, suggested by David Bennett, is Kevlar, imported from Earth (which would be cheaper, in terms of mass, to import from Earth than conventional steel). Sulfur based \\"Waterless Concrete\\" This proposal is based on the observation that water is likely to be a precious commodity on the Moon. Also sulfur gains strength in a very short time and doesn't need any period of cooling, unlike hydraulic cement. This would reduce the time that human astronauts would need to be exposed to the surface lunar environment.Performance of ‚ÄúWaterless Concrete‚Äù Houssam A. Toutanji Steve Evans Richard N. GrugelPRODUCTION OF LUNAR CONCRETE USING MOLTEN SULFUR, Final Research Report for JoVe NASA Grant NAG8 - 278, Dr. Husam A. Omar Department of Civil Engineering University of South Alabama Sulfur is present on the Moon in the form of the mineral troilite, (FeS) and could be reduced to obtain sulfur. It also doesn't require the ultra high temperatures needed for extraction of cementitious components (e.g. anorthosites). Sulfur concrete is an established construction material. Strictly speaking it isn't a concrete as there is little by way of chemical reaction. Instead the sulfur acts as a thermoplastic material binding with a non reactive substrate. Cement and water are not required. The concrete doesn't have to be cured, instead it is simply heated to above the melting point of sulfur, 140 ¬∞C, and after cooling it reaches high strength immediately. The best mixture for tensile and compressive strength is 65% JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant and 35% sulfur, with an average compressive strength of 33.8 MPa and tensile strength of 3.7 MPa. Addition of 2% metal fiber increase the compressive strength to 43.0 MPaPRODUCTION OF LUNAR CONCRETE USING MOLTEN SULFUR Final Research Report for JoVe NASA Grant NAG8 - 278 by Dr. Husam A. Omar Addition of silica also increases the strength of the concrete.Strength and Durability Performance of Waterless Lunar Concrete Houssam Toutanji, Becca Glenn-Loper, and Beth Schrayshuen This sulfur concrete could be of especial value for dust minimization, for instance to create a launching pad for rockets leaving the Moon. Issues with \\"Sulfur Concrete\\" It provides less protection from cosmic radiation, so walls would need to be thicker than concrete walls (the water in concrete is an especially good absorber of cosmic radiation). Sulfur melts at 115.2 ¬∞C, and lunar temperatures in high latitudes can reach 123 Celsius at midday. In addition, the temperature changes could change the volume of the sulfur concrete due to polymorphic transitions in the sulfur. (see Allotropes of sulfur). So unprotected sulfur concrete on the Moon, if directly exposed to the surface temperatures, would need to be limited to higher latitudes or shaded locations with maximum temperatures less than 96 ¬∞C and monthly variations not exceeding 114 ¬∞C. The material would degrade through repeated temperature cycles, but the effects are likely to be less extreme on the Moon due to the slowness of the monthly temperature cycle. The outer few millimeters may be damaged through sputtering from impact of high energy particles from the solar wind and solar flares. This may however be easy to repair, by reheating or recoating the surface layers in order to sinter away cracks and heal the damage.  Use  David Bennett, of the British Cement Association, argues that lunarcrete has the following advantages as a construction material for lunar bases: * Lunarcrete production would require less energy than lunar production of steel, aluminium, or brick. * It is unaffected by temperature variations of +120 ¬∞C to ‚àí150 ¬∞C. * It will absorb gamma rays. * Material integrity is not affected by prolonged exposure to vacuum. Although free water will evaporate from the material, the water that is chemically bound as a result of the curing process will not. He observes, however, that lunarcrete is not an airtight material, and to make it airtight would require the application of an epoxy coating to the interior of any lunarcrete structure. Bennett suggests that hypothetical lunar buildings made of lunarcrete would most likely use a low-grade concrete block for interior compartments and rooms, and a high-grade dense silica particle cement-based concrete for exterior skins.

Bred and raced by Bertram R. Firestone, he was sired by Run the Gantlet, the 1971 American Champion Male Turf Horse and a son of Tom Rolfe, the 1965 Preakness Stakes winner and American Champion Three- Year-Old Male Horse. His dam was Prudent Girl, a daughter of Primera who raced in England where he won back-to-back editions of the Princess of Wales's Stakes in 1959‚Äì1960. Trained by Fran√ßois Boutin, Providential made two starts at age two. After making a winning debut on October 29, 1979 at Saint-Cloud Racecourse, he came back on November 11 to win the Group 2 Crit√©rium de Saint- Cloud. In January 1980, Providential was sold to Serge Fradkoff, a Swiss businessman who also campaigned Perrault and Kilijaro in France and the United States. In his first start for his new owner on April 13, 1980, Providential won the Group 2 Prix Greffulhe at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. On the same racecourse, the colt ran second in the Prix Hocquart and third in France's most important race for three-year-old colts, the Group 1 Prix du Jockey Club. Fradkoff then entrusted the horse's race conditioning to Olivier Douieb who saddled him to three unsuccessful starts in France, a third-place finish in the Premio Roma at Capannelle Racecourse in Rome, Italy, and twentieth place in a Group 1 race at Hip√≥dromo de San Isidro in Argentina. In 1981, Serge Fradkoff sent Providential to the care of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Charlie Whittingham at Santa Anita Park in California. For Whittingham, Providential finished second in his October debut and then second in the Grade II Carleton F. Burke Handicap. Ridden by French jockey Alain Lequeux, in November Providential won the most important race of his career against an international field in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland over April Run. Returning to California, he won the inaugural running of the Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack over John Henry who was fourth. Raced in 1982 with limited success, Providential was retired to stud. His offspring met with limited success in racing. Providential died of a heart attack at age twenty-one in May 1998 at Derby Hill Farm in Mount Airy, Maryland.

This group of enzymes has a low substrate specificity and catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate esters in a basic environment. The major function of alkaline phosphatase is transporting across cell membranes. Alkaline phosphatases are present in many human tissues, including bone, intestine, kidney, liver, placenta and white blood cells. Damage to these tissues causes the release of ALP into the bloodstream. Elevated levels can be detected through a blood test. Elevated alkaline phosphate is associated with certain medical conditions or syndromes (e.g., hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome, HPMRS). It serves as a significant indication for certain medical conditions, diseases and syndromes. If the reason for alkaline phosphatase is unknown, isoenzyme studies using electrophoresis can confirm the source of the ALP. Heat stability also distinguishes bone and liver isoenzymes (\\"bone burns, liver lasts\\"). CauseLiver= * Liver (liver ALP): ** Cholestasis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis, fatty liver, sarcoidosis, liver tumor, liver metastases, drug intoxication ** Drugs: e.g. verapamil, carbamazepine, phenytoin, erythromycin, allopurinol, ranitidine, Numerous Antibiotics =Bones= * Bone disease (bone ALP): ** Paget's disease, osteosarcoma, bone metastases of prostatic cancer (High / very high ALP values) ** Other bone metastases ** Renal osteodystrophy ** Fractured bone * Skeletal involvement of other primary diseases: ** Osteomalacia, rickets, vitamin D deficiency (moderate rise) ** Malignant tumors (ALP originating from tumor) ** Renal disease (secondary hyperparathyroidism) ** Primary hyperthyroidism Other unlisted musculoskeletal conditions may also cause elevated alkaline phosphatase. = Obesity = Elevated levels of the alkaline phosphatase enzyme are reported with those who have obesity. A study reported there were higher serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in obese than in the non obese. With elevated alkaline phosphatase levels there is an increase in disproportionate intracellular fat depots and thereby releasing itself into the bloodstream. The relationship between alkaline phosphatase and obesity is still being tested. = Kidney = Elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase has been associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Recently, studies have shown that elevated levels may predict mortality independent of bone metabolism factors and liver function tests in CKD. This distinction is indicated by the markers of inflammations specifically from C-reactive protein (CRP) with elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase. Hence, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity may be a marker for inflammation because of its association with elevated levels of CRP. * Chronic kidney disease =Cancer= Elevated alkaline phosphatase in patients with cancer normally spans throughout the bones or liver. Metastases that exist in the lung, breast, prostate, colon, thyroid, and further organs can penetrate in the liver or bone. Yet, cancers that are already present in certain organs and tissues can produce alkaline phosphatase elevations if metastasis is not present. Isoenzymes, which are certain forms of alkaline phosphatase generated by these tumors, enlarges the total volume of alkaline phosphatase levels on experiential studies. The Regan isoenzyme is one of the best studies of these isoenzymes that is linked to several human cancers. Basically, the Regan isozenzyme is an alkaline phosphatase that is located in the placenta and associated with the gonadal and urologic cancers. * Breast carcinoma * Colon cancer * Leukemia ‚Äì cancer of the bone marrow * Lymphoma ‚Äì cancer of the white blood cells * Pancreatic cancer * Lung cancer  Diagnosis  An alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme test can be done to check for elevated ALP levels. Tissues that contain high levels of ALP include the liver, bile ducts, and bones. Normal levels of ALP range from (44 to 147) U/L (units per liter) and significantly elevated levels may be an indication of conditions such as various types of cancer, bone disease such as Paget disease, liver disease such as hepatitis, blood disorders, or other conditions. Elevated alkaline phosphatase is most commonly caused by liver disease or bone disorders. Testing for ALP primarily consists of obtaining a blood sample from a patient along with several other tests for the disorder in question that may be associated with the increase in ALP in the blood serum. It is possible to distinguish between the different forms (isoenzymes) of ALP produced by different types of tissues in the body, in order to pinpoint what's causing the increase of ALP, in order to treat the patient for either liver disease or bone disorder. A more rapid way for testing ALP concentration is by using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The required volume of serum is 5 mm3. for each testing. The sample is first incubated for 30 min. at 38 ¬∞C, in a buffered solution in the presence of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. By the action of ALP, phosphate groups are removed from the substrate and para- nitrophenol is liberated giving off a yellow color in solution which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Normally, children and adolescents have higher Alkaline Phosphatase levels than adults due to an increase in bone growth. ALP is especially high during a period of growth spurt which occurs are different ages in boys and girls.

In 1994 he served as a peacekeeper in the UNAMIR forces in Rwanda under general Rom√©o Dallaire. For his dedication in saving lives during Rwandan genocide at the risk to his own he was awarded the Cross of Merit for Bravery by Polish President Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. He died at the age of 41 due to complications from posttraumatic stress disorder.History? This film is fiction - A new BBC film telling the 'truth' of events in Rwanda only compounds the original sins of the West's media, Linda Melvern, The Observer, March 19, 2006  Youth and service in UNTAC  Stefan Steƒá began his studies in 1982 at the Warsaw Military University of Technology, but then volunteered for service in Polish peacekeeping UN forces and completed training at the Polish peacekeeping centre in Kielce-Buk√≥wka. On his first UN mission he was assigned in 1992 to UNTAC forces at Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. The goal of the mission was to supervise the first Cambodia parliamentary election. Poland provided a contingent in the size of the battalion containing engineering and logistic units repairing roads and bridges and providing operational units with water, food and fuel.Polacy w s≈Çu≈ºbie pokoju 1953-2003, Agencja Wydawnicza CB, Warszawa 2002, The mission ended in September 1993.  Service in UNAMIR during the Rwandan genocide  His next mission was small and ill-equipped UNAMIR-1 mission intended to oversee a transition from dictatorship to democracy in Rwanda and described by optimistic politicians as \\"classic\\".Major Stefan Stec - UN peacekeeper on 'Mission Impossible' in Rwanda, Linda Melvern, The Independent, October 7, 2005 Only five Polish officers and cadets, mostly from finished UNTAC mission in Cambodia served in the UNAMIR mission that lasted from October 1993 till March 1996. They arrived in Kigali in November and December 1993 and their task was to prepare plans and organization of logistic support for the UNAMIR-1. Upon arrival Steƒá noticed however that the other UN soldiers referred to the mission as a \\"Mission Impossible\\" due to the racism, the Hutu Power militia and the human rights abuses. \\"It felt as though we were sitting on a barrel of gunpowder, waiting for a spark. (...) genocide hung in the air\\", and \\"the international community was playing for time, waiting for some final solution to the Rwandan problem\\". But no one could ever have imagined the scale of what was to come. When the genocide in Rwanda began on April 6, 1994, Steƒá was one of the first UN officers (with Polish Major Marek Pazik, Canadian Major Brent Beardsley and a three-man Bangladesh crew) who, called upon by two other Polish UNAMIR officers, Majors Jerzy MƒÖczka and Ryszard Chudy, arrived by Czech armoured personnel carrier to the location of a massacre in Gikondo, the first discovered by UNAMIR.The Media and the Rwanda Genocide: walking the road to genocide, Gerald Caplan Call et al, IDRC, 2007, Steƒá filmed the bodies with his camcorder in order to secure the proof of a possible genocide and was the first UNAMIR officer to use this word. As noted later \\"we were explicitly forbidden to use the word genocide in our correspondence to New York\\". Massacres like the one in Gikondo would become commonplace. \\"We had a well-organised genocide rolling through the country\\". There were an estimated 10,000 people being killed each day by Interahamwe. Steƒá and fellow Polish officer Marek Pazik were assigned by Force Commander, BGen General Romeo Dallaire, with setting up a Humanitarian Assistance Cell to co-ordinate and organize rescue teams to save Tutsi under threat from extremists. By April 15, 1994 they had devised a plan for the creation of secure zones and an initial plan for co-ordinating relief supplies from UN and NGO agencies still operating in the country as well as a plan for protecting vulnerable Rwandans. Their initial efforts in this regard were handed over to Colonel Clayton Yaache of Ghana who had been assigned by BGen Dallaire to formally establish and command the UNAMIR-1 Humanitarian Assistance Cell (HAC) which by this time consisted of Steƒá, Pazik two recently deployed Canadian majors Luc-Andre Racine and Donny MacNeil. Unfortunately, the plans developed by Stec and Pazik could not entirely implemented due to concerns on implementation by the UN Security Council, or more specifically Paris, London, Washington, D.C., and Brussels. \\"Instead of saving people, UNAMIR was tasked with pursuing the near impossible task of getting the Rwandan Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front, who had crossed the demilitarized zone en masse to intervene on behalf of the threatened Tutsi population, to agree to a cease fire amidst the carnage of killings that were taking place throughout the country and genocidal announcements being broadcast by the Government controlled Radio Rwanda. Basically, it sounded to Stec that UNAMIR was to \\"not save people, but rather play for time and see how things developed\\". HAC had selected some 91 secure zones in Rwanda, but withy the departure from theatre of the Belgian and Bangladesh contingents, there were only enough UNAMIR soldiers to provide security at but five locales in Kigali; The Hotel des Milles Collines, the Meridian Hotel and the King Faycal Hospital manned by UNAMIR's Tunisian company and the Amahoro Stadium manned by UNAMIR's Ghanaian battalion. In addition, a number of Tutsi sought refuge at UNAMIR HQ at the Amahoro Hotel and the Force Commander had tasked his UN Military Observers (MILOBs) with monitoring the security situation at the Sainte- Famille church which was being somewhat secured by the Rwandan Gendarmerie and where a large number of Tutsi had sought safety. The remainder of UNAMIRs troops were tasked with securing the Kigali Airport to ensure evacuations and air delivery of humanitarian aid. In early May 1994 Colonel Yaache was tasked with organizing and leading an evacuation of particularly vulnerable Rwandans from the Hotel des Milles Collines who had been guaranteed asylum by a number of European countries. Steƒá, Pazik and Major Donny MacNeil participated in this operation along with a protection force made up of a section of Tunisian peacekeepers. \\"I had a 'Schindler's List' of the people we were allowed to save\\". MacNeil and Stec found themselves reading the names of the chosen few in the crowded hotel lobby. The conditions for selection were that they had been granted a visa and their sponsors could guarantee their financial support. Although the operation was approved by the leadership of the Rwandan military, the evacuation attempt was unsuccessful with the convoy being split and halted by Rwandan military and Interahamwe. Following a very dangerous and life threatening stand off at these roadblocks, through tense negotiation, Yaache and MacNeil managed to prevent the evacuees from being killed and persuaded the Rwandan leadership to have the evacuees returned safely to the Hotel des Milles Collines. While there was no loss of life, a number of the evacuees had been assaulted by the Rwandan troops and Interahamwe. At this point it became evident to the Force Commander and the soldiers of UNAMIR that the Rwandan military and gendarme leadership were not able to control the population and in particular the Iterahamwe. A few blocks away from the Mille Collines, there was a church, l' Eglise St. Famille, with more than 5000 refugees, where nightly, Interahamwe, under the nose of the Gendarmerie stationed there, were dragging away victims for killing. Without visas, they could not be evacuated out of country, however the presence of UN MILOB patrols reduced significantly the violence and indeed later the UANMIR HAC was successful in evacuation those in peril to the RPF controlled area. Later in May 1994, Steƒá and his colleagues, together with Colonel Yaache and BGen Dallaire, concluded that the establishment of safe zones could still be done and concluded that it was the right thing to do but once again the political support was not there despite the continued failure to obtain a ceasefire and the continuing massacres occurring within the country. Despite this setback, the HAC, in addition to supporting UN and NGO with the safe delivery of humanitarian supplies, revived a plan to safely evacuate Hutus who had sought protection within the RPF zone and Tutsi who had sought refuge in the Government controlled zone. After formal meetings with the Government and RPF leadership, an agreement was formalized whereby an equal number of evacuees could be exchanged by UN convoy across front lines. Despite the RPF firing randomly at times on the convoys, during the month of June 1994, UANMIR Ghanaian troops successfully evacuated some 2000 Rwandans in peril across the front lines to safety. These convoys became more and more difficult depending on the tactical situation of the opposing sides. It became evident that the operation was becoming ineffective as the RPF advanced and put safe areas in the government zone in peril. \\"At that time, a sense of rebellion was emerging within UNAMIR; whispers of a nonsense operation were heard among military observers to describe the refugee transfers we did\\".. It was then Steƒá considered deserting UNAMIR and joining the Rwandan Patriotic Front in protest. But still he had the list of people that were allowed to be saved and actually were. When the United Nations Security Council, at the instigation of the United Kingdom, had determined that UNAMIR be withdrawn, leaving only a \\"token force\\" to \\"appease public opinion\\", Steƒá remained in Rwanda even though the council terminated sending supplies to the remaining peacekeepers. Amahoro Foundation Stefan Steƒá along with street children in Ndera (Kigali Province, Rwanda) After the genocide was over in July 1994 Steƒá left UNAMIR and made a home with his partner Heather Kilner in The Hague. Working in computer technology, he saved enough money to establish in December 2001, along with Kilner, the Amahoro Foundation. Since then the foundation has assisted children, particularly orphans, with advanced education and relief from poverty in Rwanda, connecting people of goodwill, generally supported only by a website designed by Stec. For his exceptional courage in Rwanda, saving lives at the risk to his own, he was personally thanked by the Polish President Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, who honored him with the Cross of Merit for Bravery. Steƒá dedicated this cross to all volunteers who stayed with UNAMIR and especially to General Dallaire, \\"whose courage and leadership kept us going despite the lack of support from the international community\\". In 2005, Steƒá was invited to a special showing of Hotel Rwanda in the Hague. After the film, which portrays the peacekeepers as ineffectual, there was a panel discussion during which Steƒá was publicly blamed for not having done enough to save Rwandan lives. Steƒá fell ill after the viewing. He stopped eating despite intervention by psychiatrists who had treated soldiers from the Dutch UN battalion in Srebrenica, and subsequently died due to complications from posttraumatic stress disorder in September 2005. In the 2007 Canadian drama feature film Shake Hands with the Devil Steƒá is played by Mark Antony Krupa.

He guided Springfield to division titles in 1986 and 1987 and Arkansas to a league championship in 1989, earning him Texas League Manager of the Year honors. Pitts' first five years coaching for the Major League club occurred from (1991 to 95) on Joe Torre's staff when Torre was the field boss of the Redbirds. His coaching roles included hitting (1991), bullpen (1992 St. Louis Cardinals season), bench coach in 1995.

In extra innings, Albert Pujols who was at the time 20 years old, hit a walk-off home run to win the title. During his most recent managerial assignment, he was the manager of the Palm Beach Cardinals, St. Louis' High-A affiliate in the Florida State League. He opened the season as the Cards' special assistant for player development and served in that role until joining Matheny's staff.

On the central theme of the Church itself it was reduced to a petition, fathered by A√±overos jointly with the Jaca bishop √Ångel Hidalgo Ib√°√±ez, that the doctrine of Cuerpo M√≠stico deserves more elaboration.Evangelista Vilanova, Los \\"vota\\" de los obispos espa√±oles despu√©s del anuncio del Concilio Vaticano II (1959), [in:] Revista Catalana de Teologia 15 (1990), p. 391 During the Council itself he participated in all 4 sessions from 1962 to 1965.Antonio A√±overos y Ataun entry, [in:] Diocesis Malaga service Though Spanish bishops as a group constituted one of the most conservative blocs of the assembled hierarchy,Juan Mar√≠a Laboa Gallego, Los obispos espa√±oles en el Concilio, [in:] Anuario de Historia de la Iglesia 14 (2005), pp. 29‚Äì50 A√±overos emerged in the middle, siding neither with the reformist nor with the conservative wing. His contribution to Vaticanum II was moderate; though counted among the 3,000 Council Fathers,Antonio A√±overos y Ataun entry, [in:] Diocesis Malaga service he neither chaired any section nor was particularly active on any specific topic. However, he took part in a number of debates. The liturgical reform focused on enhanced participation of the lay in the mass. A√±overos was in the majority favoring introduction of the vernacular, resulting in the sixth amendment to the constitution on liturgy (Sacrosanctum Concilium, 1963); it allowed a freedom of action while at the same time making provision for an increased use of modern languages in the liturgy.Monika Selle, Latein und Volkssprache im Gottesdienst.

He perceived the Christian-Muslim dialogue as feasible and insisted it is enhanced, stressing that the Christians respectfully recognize Muslim spiritual and that moral values and all missionary endeavors be tailored accordingly.Relationship to Non-Christian Religions, [in:] Metamporphose service, available here Pzza S. Pietro, Vaticanum II Contributing to Declaration on Religious Freedom, (Dignitatis Humanae, 1965), and especially during the discussion on the so-called 4 SC (textus reemendatus), A√±overos spoke against the version prepared by the Council for Promoting Christian Unity and joined the 70-something group of bishops who formed part of the opposition nucleus.Pawel Milcarek, Wprowadzenie do lektury Nostra aetate, [in:] Academia service, available here Though far from the fundamental rejection advocated by Marcel Lefebvre (or even critique from some fellow Spaniards like Abilio del Campo), A√±overos called for setting limits of religious liberty.claiming the common good was not compatible with dissemination of error, Laboa Gallego 2005, p. 42, Pawe≈Ç Milcarek, Wprowadzenie do lektury Dignitatis humanae, [in:] Academia service, available here He argued that the state had the right to limit religious freedom to safeguard three values: a political good, that is the public peace: a moral good, that is the defense of public morality; and a civil good, that is the harmony of citizens in the exercise of their legitimate rights. He suggested further elaboration of the text during works of a new sub-commission, and called for changing the title, suggesting Civil Liberty in Religious Matters instead.The Catholic NorthWest Progress 24 September 1965, available here, Laboa Gallego 2005, p. 47 Bishop of C√°diz and Ceuta mid-Francoism, Spanish peasants Following the death of Tom√°s Guti√©rrez D√≠ez, in 1964 A√±overos succeeded him as titular bishop of C√°diz and Ceuta.Antonio A√±overos Ataun entry, [in:] Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia Though during long strings he was absent from the area due to Second Vatican Council engagements, he is known to have ruled the diocese with iron hand,Gorritxategi San Sebasti√°n 2009 his key concerns having been the seminary and social issues.in Cadiz his key concerns are listed as \\"el seminario, la conciencia social, la alfabetizaci√≥n y la vivienda\\", La Hsistoria, [in:] Catedral de C√°diz service, available here It is also at his C√°diz-Ceuta assignment that he gained nationwide recognition. Until some point A√±overos' focus on poverty, injustice, labor and social issues in general appeared to have been in line with syndicalist Falangist viewpoint, but already when assisting Herrera Oria in M√°laga his relations with the Movimiento were getting cold.Cristian Cer√≥n Torreblanca, Las relaciones iglesia-estado en M√°laga durante el franquismo 1936‚Äì1975, [in:] Baetica. Estudios de Arte, Geograf√≠a e Historia 31 (2009), pp. 481‚Äì4 A√±overos' increasingly vocal support for Catholic labor groupings, Hermandad Obrera de Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica (HOAC) and Juventud Obrera Cristiana de Espa√±a (JOC), was putting him on collision course with the official policy,Francisco Javier Torres Barranco, Los movimientos obreros especializados de Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica de la Di√≥cesis de C√°diz: JOC y HOAC. Una aproximaci√≥n hist√≥rica y apost√≥lica, [in:] Trocadero: Revista de historia moderna y contemporanea 27 (2015), pp. 101‚Äì121. A√±overos was noted for chiding Falangist unions as undemocratic, at the same time praising Catholic groups as acting \\"with heroic courage at times in hostile environments\\", Patrick J. Sullivan, Catholic Social Thought on Labor-Management Issues, 1960‚Äì1980, available here especially as the organizations were assuming an alternative and challenging format.A√±overos organized the national congresses of HOAC in Cadiz and hosted independent 1 May celebrations at the religious premises, see Torres Barranco 2015, pp. 111‚Äì112, Foweraker 2003, p. 103 Some of his gestures looked like manifestos, which pitted the world of poverty against that of glamour and officialdom.he became renowned for declining a generous grant for renovation of the destitute C√°diz Cathedral, claiming that in the city with so many social needs it would have been immoral , Bausset 2014. He was last noted as leading marriage ceremonies of local aristocrats in 1959 see ABC 23 October 1959, available here Also in his sermons he embraced similar threads, e.g. when he lamented the plight of agricultural workers in Andalusia and lambasted lack of social conscience by the upper strata.e.g. criticizing many absentee owners of large estates, who were held partially responsible for some of the abject conditions in which the lease-holding peasants lived. He was especially critical of a lack of dialogue between the agricultural workers and their employers, with many campesinos abandoning their rights in fear of reprisals. Approving of laws on social justice, he declared it more important to live according to the grave obligations of conscience. Compare Juan Cejudo, Mi experiencia con un obispo excepcional: Antonio A√±overos, [in:] Redes Cristianas 27 June 2009, available here, Gorritxategi San Sebasti√°n 2009 However, at that time A√±overos was careful not to enter an openly confrontational path; in 1966 he presided over the 1966 Ceuta celebrations of 30th anniversary of \\"Convoy de la victoria\\".La Vanguardia 6 August 1966, available here Cadiz cathedral After death of the conservative primate Enrique Pla y Deniel A√±overos became more vocal within the Spanish episcopate; he co-engineered condemnation of the official vertical unions, declared by the Bishops Conference in July 1968.compare Granollers Comunidad Cristiana 13 October 1968; he was quoted saying that \\"en sana doctrina .sindical es dif√≠cil admitir que la declaraci√≥n del episcopado coincide en lo fundamental con las directrices y programas del actual desarroUo sindical\\" Gradually his articles in HOAC bulletins,M√≥nica Moreno Seco, La presse catholique sous le franquisme: le Bolet√≠n HOAC (1959‚Äì1975), [in:] El Argonauta Espa√±ol 01 (2004), available here sermons and pastoral letters were assuming increasingly severe tone;Foweraker 2003, p. 103 some references, like the ones about \\"the oppressed\\", were no longer compatible even with most flexibly applied official line.compare his recommendation that the Church \\"debe estar muy cerca de los oprimidos\\", La Vanguardia 22 March 1969, available here Apart from focus on social issues A√±overos advocated also a new Church animated by the Vaticanum II spirit;compare La Vanguardia 14 October 1966, available here, or La Vanguardia 22 March 1969, available here he also voiced in favor of family values in what seemed like confronting a new, consumer lifestyle.Gorritxategi San Sebasti√°n 2009, Laboa Gallego 2005, p. 45, La Vanguardia 3 January 1970, available here With the censorship almost lifted, in the late 1960s his sermons were getting widely quoted in the Spanish press; their author gained a nationwide recognition, e.g. declared Person of the Year by the Catalan periodical Mundo in 1970.Hidalgo 2009 A√±overos approved of and supported the phenomenon of ‚Äûcuras obreros‚Äù, encouraging seminarians from C√°diz to take up labor assignments in local industry.Cejudo 2009 This, combined with his focus on social issues and down-to-earth profile of a \\"parish bishop\\",\\"obispo-paroco\\", Jos√© Antonio Hernandez, A√±overos, [in:] Redes Cristianas service 21 June 2009, available here drew comparisons to H√©lder C√¢mara, chief exponent of the Latin American so-called liberation theology,Hernandez 2009, Jos√© Casanova, Public Religions in the Modern World, Chicago 1994, , p. 83, Said Amir Arjomand, The Political Dimensions of Religion, New York 1993, , p. 111, also the A√±overos obituary in La Vanguardia 25 October 1987, available here though A√±overos has never admitted embracing the concept.

Already his Cadiz appointment was tricky and required gimmicks, Foweraker 2003, p. 103 On the other hand, some scholars claim that Franco actually wanted A√±overos to land in Bilbao, hoping that his image of a popular hierarch would help to pacify the unruly region.Xabier Hualde Amun√°rriz, La Iglesia vasca durante el franquismo (1939‚Äì1975) seg√∫n los diplom√°ticos franceses, [in:] Trabajos y ensayos 8 (2008), p. 12-13 This version seems corroborated by the fact that Consejo Presbiteral de Bilbao initially opposed A√±overos' nomination, reportedly concerned about his Carlist and Falangist record.Juan Manuel Gonz√°lez S√°ez, Geograf√≠a eclesial y construcci√≥n de la indentidad nacinalista: la revindicaci√≥n de pa provincia eclesi√°stica vasca durente el tardofranquismo y la transici√≥n, [in:] Historia Contempor√°nea 46 (2012), p. 322, Jos√© Andr√©s- Gallego, Ant√≥n M.

Within the Carlist realm already in 1974 he was considered a subversive progressist; a note by Traditionalist pundit El√≠as de Tejada ironically demanded that his call for honoring regional rights be met by restoring traditional Biscay regulations, which in turn would trigger fueros-based proceedings against A√±overos.Francisco El√≠as de Tejada, Suplica la promoci√≥n y aprobaci√≥n de una ley de privilegio a favor del obispo A√±overos, [in:] ¬øQu√© Pasa? 30 March 1974, quoted after Hispanismo service, available here A present-day Traditionalist intellectual, Jos√© Miguel Gambra, lines up A√±overos, and especially his stress on individual and collective liberties, within the trend which contributed to de-Christianization of Spain.Jos√© Miguel Gambra, El postconcilio y la decristianizaci√≥n de Espa√±a, [in:] Fuente \\"Tradici√≥n Cat√≥lica\\".

According to the author, A√±overos and Setien \\"coincidieron en defender las revindicaciones de ETA al tiempo que condenaban la violencia\\"; the former noted on 18 May 1975 that \\"violence can be eradicated only by doing away with its causes\\". The spirit of episcopal communication started to change in the early 1980s.

The town was established in 1897 as part of the Union Mining District after the opening of the Berlin Mine the previous year. The name is a transfer from Berlin, in Germany, the native land of a share of the local prospectors. The town never prospered to the same extent as other boom towns like Tonopah and Goldfield, and declined following the Panic of 1907. The town was largely abandoned by 1911. The site was acquired by the state of Nevada as part of Berlin‚ÄìIchthyosaur State Park in 1970. The town is on the western side of the Shoshone Range on the edge of Toiyabe National Forest at an elevation of about above sea level. At elevations above the townsite the forest becomes more dense and provided a source of building materials for the town. The town is arranged in a U shape, opening to the east. At its peak, the town had about 75 buildings and 300 residents. Berlin was a company town, operated by the Nevada Company and was maintained until its acquisition by the state in 1970. This accounts for the town's excellent state of preservation. The town of Union, to the east, functioned as a suburb to Berlin. The Berlin Mine had of tunnels, but produced less than $1 million worth of gold and silver during its lifetime. The Diana mine connects to the Berlin Mine at the fourth level and is preserved as a mining museum. Tours of the Diana Mine were halted in 2007 until a safety review could be completed. The preserved buildings in Berlin include the mine supervisor's house, now the park office, the assay office and a machine shop. The 30-stamp mill, one of the best of its type in the state, has been stabilized. The town was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Function words (determiners, for example) are usually chosen during realisation. Examples The simplest type of lexical choice involves mapping a domain concept (perhaps represented in an ontology) to a word. For example, the concept Finger might be mapped to the word finger. A more complex situation is when a domain concept is expressed using different words in different situations. For example, the domain concept Value-Change can be expressed in many ways * The temperature rose: the verb rose is used for a Value-Change in temperature which increases the value * The temperature fell: the verb fell is used for a Value-Change in temperature which decreases the value * The rain got heavier: the phrase got heavier is used for a Value- Change in precipitation amount when the precipitation is rain. Sometimes words can communicate additional contextual information, for example * The temperature plummeted: the verb plummeted is used for a Value-Change in temperature which decreases the value, when the change is rapid and large Contextual information is especially significant for vague terms such as tall. For example, a 2m tall man is tall, but a 2m tall horse is small. Linguistic perspective Lexical choice modules must be informed by linguistic knowledge of how the system's input data maps onto words. This is a question of semantics, but it is also influenced by syntactic factors (such as collocation effects) and pragmatic factors (such as context). Hence NLG systems need linguistic models of how meaning is mapped to words in the target domain (genre) of the NLG system. Genre tends to be very important; for example the verb veer has a very specific meaning in weather forecasts (wind direction is changing in a clockwise direction) which it does not have in general English, and a weather-forecast generator must be aware of this genre-specific meaning. In some cases there are major differences in how different people use the same word;E Reiter and S Sripada (2002). Human Variation and Lexical Choice. Computational Linguistics 28:545-553. for example, some people use by evening to mean 6PM and others use it to mean midnight. Psycholinguists have shown that when people speak to each other, they agree on a common interpretation via lexical alignment;S Brennan and H Clark (1996). Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition 22:1482-1493 this is not something which NLG systems can yet do. Ultimately, lexical choice must deal with the fundamental issue of how language relates to the non-linguistic world.D Roy and E Reiter (2005). Connecting Language to the World. Artificial Intelligence 167:1-12. For example, a system which chose colour terms such as red to describe objects in a digital image would need to know which RGB pixel values could generally be described as red; how this was influenced by visual (lighting, other objects in the scene) and linguistic (other objects being discussed) context; what pragmatic connotations were associated with red (for example, when an apple is called red, it is assumed to be ripe as well as have the colour red); and so forth. Algorithms and models A number of algorithms and models have been developed for lexical choice in the research community,Perera, R. and Nand, P 2015. A Multi-Strategy Approach for Lexicalizing Linked Open Data. for example Edmonds developed a model for choosing between near-synonyms (words with similar core meanings but different connotations).P Edmonds and G Hirst (2002). Near-Synonymy and Lexical Choice. Computational Linguistics 28:105-144. However such algorithms and models have not been widely used in applied NLG systems; such systems have instead often used quite simple computational models, and invested development effort in linguistic analysis instead of algorithm development.

From San Ysidro, California, Bobby Jones was the son of Alfred L. Jones, who was involved in horse racing and who raised Thoroughbreds. Bobby Jones rode professionally at Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico but rose to prominence riding at racetracks in Chicago. In 1931 he was a contract jockey for the stable of Mrs. Emil Denemark, and others, and was the leading jockey at Arlington Park. The August 8, 1932 issue of the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote that Jones was considered \\"one of the greatest jockeys ever to come out of the west.\\" The December 26, 1932 issue of the Tribune reported that he had signed a contract with racing stable owner Willis Sharpe Kilmer that could earn him $50,000 in 1933. While he met with little success riding for the Kilmer stable, Jones had also signed to ride for the Whitney family's famous Greentree Stable in 1933. That year, he led all jockeys in the United States in purse money won, finishing ahead of greats such as Silvio Coucci, Charlie Kurtsinger, Raymond Workman, Wayne Wright, and Mack Garner. Bobby Jones made three straight appearances in the Kentucky Derby between 1933 and 1935 but finished off the board each time. In 1934 he rode for Isabel Dodge Sloane's Brookmeade Stable and for Liz Whitney. His 1934 successes included a win aboard High Quest in the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series. Following the building of Santa Anita Racetrack in 1934, Bobby Jones returned to ride in California where he won the 1936 Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap. In 1937 he was competing at Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno, California when he was severely injured in a fall. Although he later returned to racing on a limited basis, Jones never fully recovered and in a weakened condition died of pneumonia on March 9, 1938 at his parents' home in San Ysidro.

It is one of his earliest known poems and was included in a letter to his brother Luke. The poem describes the joy of Easter but also warns of possible future sorrows after one loses his innocence. The poem concludes with a Neoplatonic emphasis of virtue being able to conquer suffering. Background \\"Easter Holidays\\", along with \\"Dura Navis\\" and \\"Nil Pejus est Caelibe Vita\\", is one of Coleridge's earliest known poems.Sarker p. 43 The poem was written in 1787 while Coleridge attended Christ's Hospital, London. During his school days, he was a lonely child and was unable to spend holidays with family like other boys at the school. This loneliness was broken with the arrival of his brothers George and Luke in 1785, but returned when Luke moved to Devon. In a letter to Luke on 12 May 1787, he expressed his feelings of loneliness. Included in the letter was his poem, \\"Easter Holidays\\", which seeks to celebrate Easter. This was the first time Coleridge included a poem with one of his letters.Ashton 1997 pp. 22‚Äì23 Poem Coleridge begins his poem with a standard invocation of the muse:Kneale p. 73 The poem then describes the festivities of Easter and the joy that comes with it:Ashton 1997 p. 23 This transitions into a comparison between present happiness and future pain: The suffering comes from the youths' fall from innocence, but their innocence is also what kept them from knowing that they will suffer. However, the poem ends with a message of hope:Werkmeister 1961 pp. 109‚Äì110 Themes The themes of the poem were influenced by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon who wrote the Cato's Letters, a series of letters on religion, sin, and suffering under the pseudonym Cato. They promoted the belief that suffering originated in vice, and that man is ever subject to passions that cannot be controlled. This is connected to Coleridge experiencing both suffering and guilt over what he described later as his loss of innocence. In \\"Easter Holidays\\", Coleridge describes the time of innocence as in the past although others that he attends school with are still joyful and innocent.Werkmeister 1961 pp. 105‚Äì107 However, discussion of beauty within \\"Easter Holiday\\", along with the hopeful conclusion of the poem, reveals a further influence by Neoplatonistic works, especially Plotinus's Enneads. Of Plotinus in particular, Coleridge derived his understanding of wisdom as the soul being awakened to the knowledge of God and truth. As such, Coleridge responds to the ideas of Trenchard and Gordon with a view that those who are virtuous are unaffected by suffering. Instead, only those who are vicious in nature really suffer and that people are able to conquer their fallen state.Werkmeister 1961 pp. 109‚Äì111 Sources The work is traditional and hearkens back to classical poetry. Coleridge studied Horace at Christ's Hospital, and his 13th line shows this influence: \\"With mirthful dance they beat the ground\\".Smith p. 28 This influence was common to his other earlier works.Thayer 1916 p. 33 Use of the invocation \\"Hail!\\" was common during the 18th century and is connected to the epic tradition. It's predominant purpose was to address divinity of some form. His sources, including Plotinus and the Cato's Letters, originate in his studying metaphysics while attending Christ's Hospital.Werkmeister 1961 pp. 105‚Äì111 NotesReferences * Ashton, Rosemary.

AEN defines itself with dark pigmentation of the esophagus, found during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Pigmentation is usually black friable mucosa.http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&hid;=5&sid;=f15ae0b5-79ab-4288-9025-3856e725b220%40sessionmgr4 The disorder is extremely rare, as only 88 patients over a span of 40 years have received this diagnosis. Specific study of the disorder's mortality rate is mentioned at 31.8%, but new research suggests mortality rates vary from 30‚Äì50%. The exact triggering mechanism for this disorder is still unknown, but is likely multifactorial. Signs and symptoms AEN has never been recorded as a one symptom disorder, but instead present by multiple symptoms. The symptoms vary from the severity of the disorder. The most classic sign of AEN is the dark pigmentation of esophageal mucosa in an upper endoscopy, usually viewed as an ulcer or as an infectious disease. Necrosis can be found mostly between the three distals of the esophagus, but stops abruptly at the gastroesophageal junction. The basic and most common symptoms reported are blood in stool and blood in vomiting. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding then is reported, and is very commonly represented in elderly patients. Black or bloody stools and hematemesis account for over three quarters of the case presentations. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and unstable vital signs are common. A cardiovascular event (such as a heart attack) was reported in ten percent of the total known cases. Risk factorsModifiable= Having cancer (current or previous) is currently one of the most prevalent out of all conditions among patients. High blood pressure, Chronic lung conditions, Alcohol abuse, alcohol abuse/Combined w/other recreational drug use (e.g.cocaine), Kidney failure, Malnutrition are another major risk factors. =Nonmodifiable= *Advanced age (average patient aged 57 years old) *Male sex (4 to 1 male dominance) *Cirrhosis *AIDS *Herpes virus *Atrial fibrilation *Diabetes (currently the most prevalent out of all conditions in patients) =Lesser or unknown of effect= *Aortic dissection *Anti-cardiolipin antibodies *CMV infection *Herpetic infection *Hyperglycemia *Hypersensitivity to broad-spectrum antibiotics *Hypothermia *Ischemia *Gastric volvulus *Posterior mediastinal haematoma *Septic shock *Steven Johnson syndrome Diagnosis Acute esophageal necrosis can only be diagnosed by an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Treatment Currently, there is no direct treatment for AEN. Only treatment is for the underlying main diseases or conditions. Appropriate hydration is set. Antacids are also added for further recovery support. Common support drugs of antacids are either H2 receptor antagonists, and/or a proton pump inhibitor. Sucralfate was used as an option. Parenteral nutrition greatly increased chance of recovery. An esophagectomy can be issued if the disorder is severe enough. Society and culture Acute esophageal necrosis made an appearance on an American medical drama show, Dr. G: Medical Examiner. Jan Garavaglia, the show's host, receives a female body, that at time of the autopsy had a severe case of acute esophageal necrosis due to chronic alcoholism. History Acute esophageal necrosis was first described by Goldenberg et al. in 1990. Cases have emerged since 1960, but have never been described as the common names for AEN. Due to its rarity, only 88 cases have been pronounced AEN, but most likely there are many more. Gurvits et al. describes AEN as \\"poorly described in medical literature\\".

Clifton Castle In parkland by the River Ure is Clifton Castle, a 19th-century country house on the site of a 14th-century castle of the Scrope family, of which a piece of walling survives. The house is built in ashlar with stone slate roofs to an essentially T-shaped plan with a two-storey, 5-bay main block at right angles to a 3-storey, 5-bay service wing. At the front the central 3 bays have 4 large Ionic columns supporting a frieze and pediment. The estate was purchased in 1735 from the Preston family by Timothy Hutton of Marske, who demolished the castle and commissioned John Foss to build the present Grecian style house in 1802. Hutton was High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1844. On his death without heirs in 1863 the Clifton estate passed to his barrister cousin James Pulleine, who was High Sheriff for 1870. His only daughter Georgina married Major-General Sir John Clayton Cowell, Master of the Queen's Household. Sir John died in 1894 and his widow continued to live at the house. Their son Albert Victor succeeded them. The estate was then purchased around 1970 by The 8th Marquess of Downshire and passed down to his son, Nick, 9th Marquess of Downshire, who lives there with his family Janey, Isabella, Beatrice, Edmund and Claudia.

Hardcore refers to the hardcore punk music scene in and around Amherst, and Springfield, Massachusetts All White Jury performing at the May 1983 show. Origins In the very early 1980s, hardcore punk scenes began to develop in cities such as Washington DC, Boston, New York City, and Los Angeles. Evolving from traditional punk music, hardcore punk also addressed social and political topics, although often using a much faster tempo than late-70's punk music. Local hardcore scenes sprang up in many smaller East Coast cities during this period. By 1982, the Western Mass college scene, which had seen several punk bands emerge in the late 70's such as The Vandalz and 8th Route Army, had spawned a small hardcore scene. Less rigidly defined than the Straight Edge Boston scene, several bands and a number of characters would hang out and play at practice spaces, dorm rooms, and basements as local bars were reluctant to book all ages shows. A landmark show at Greenfield's Guiding Star Grange hall in January 1983 saw four local bands and four Boston bands play for hundreds of kids over several hours. There was no security, no bouncers, and no problems. Many other shows were arranged after this show, and hardcore punk bands from all over the country eventually played in Western Mass.

All White Jury- The band chose the ironic name from a short list simply because it was a name that was likely to provoke discussion. Composed of former Vandal Mike Huntoon, future Dinosaur Jr drummer Murph, and University of Massachusetts Amherst students Scott Parmenter and S. Bollen, the band was mostly known for Bollen's mohawk haircut, a relative novelty for the time and place. Their cassette \\"Apathetic Society\\" was the top-selling local release for several consecutive weeks according to the May 1983 issues of the Valley Advocate.

Legitimate foreclosure rescue can give the homeowner a realistic opportunity to regain their ability to get out of the situation and make regular timely payments again. However the fact that homeowners are often desperate at this stage has meant that foreclosure rescue has been the target for a scam known as the foreclosure rescue scheme. Homeowners have been advised to confirm any scheme is legitimate before they engage in foreclosure rescue. Foreclosure rescue came to prominence in 2007 as a result of the US subprime mortgage crisis which cause large numbers of mortgages to go into default. In response the US government unveiled a plan to provide foreclosure rescue to homeowners in 2009. History In 2009, President Barack Obama unveiled a plan to provide foreclosure rescue to homeowners. This included the ability to modify loans, lower interest rates, and help homeowners before they defaulted.

In the 19th century, 70‚Äì80% of Icelanders lived by farming, but there has been a steady decline over the years and now that figure is less than 5% of the total population.Iceland - Agriculture and Fishing Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online (retrieved 18 May 2009) It is expected that the number will continue to fall in the future. Only 1% of the total land area (of 100,000 km2) is under arable cultivation, confined almost exclusively to the peripheral lowland areas of the country. Livestock An Icelandic farm The raising of livestock, sheep (the traditional mainstay for generations of Icelandic farmers) and cattle (the latter grew rapidly in the 20th century),Iceland (Insight Guides), p119. is the main occupation, but pigs and poultry are also reared; Iceland is self-sufficient in the production of meat, dairy products and eggs. Vegetables, flowers and fodder crops Despite the cool climate Iceland (Insight guides), p115. and restricted growing season, a variety of food crops are grown, such as potatoes, turnips, carrots, cabbage, kale, maize, and cauliflower. Other hot crops (such as tomatoes, cucumbers and green peppers), cut flowers and potted plants are grown in greenhouses heated with geothermal energy (which Iceland has in abundance)‚Äîin some cases artificial light is required to supplement the shorter daylight hours at these northern latitudes. Even bananas and grapes can be grown in this way‚Äîbut not usually on a commercial scale.Iceland (Insight Guides), pp118 & 183. Fodder crops are also important: this includes grass (which in Iceland is exceptionally nutritious as a result of the long periods of daylight in the short, cool summers), rye and barley. The cool climate and northern latitude has certain advantages for agriculture: The lack of insect pests means that the use of agrochemicals‚Äîinsecticides and herbicides‚Äîis very low, and the long hours of daylight in the cool summer allow grass to grow exceptionally well. The general lack of pollution‚Äîdue to sparse population‚Äîmeans that food is less contaminated with artificial chemicals‚Äîadvantages which have been capitalised upon by a small but growing organic sector.Organic farming in Iceland 2004 by √ìafur R. D√Ωrmundsson. History The Norsemen were pastoral people who relied heavily on a succession of successful farming years in order to survive. Norwegian settlers who inhabited the coasts of Iceland in the late ninth century brought their farming traditions with them.Jesse Byock, Viking Age Iceland (London: Penguin Books, 2001), 7 The settlers brought sheep, cattle, horses, and goats from Norway to supply their farms with animals.Jesse Byock, Viking Age Iceland (London: Penguin Books, 2001), 28. Every animal served a purpose on the farm; sheep were valuable because of their ability to graze outside in the winter and they provided food and wool.Gudrun Sveinbjarnardottir, Farm Abandonment in Medieval and Post-Medieval Iceland: an Interdisciplinary Study, (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 1992), 7 Cattle supplied most of the dairy products for the farm, which were stored over winter. Cattle were also eaten.Gudrun Sveinbjarnardottir, Farm Abandonment in Medieval and Post- Medieval Iceland: an Interdisciplinary Study, (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 1992), 7. Viking farmers relied heavily on the natural pastures that encompassed their farm, but also planted grain, to be harvested for bread and fodder.H.H. Lamb, Climate, History and the Modern World: Second Edition, (London: Routledge, 1995), 176. Farming in Iceland during the Viking Age was complemented by hunting and gathering along the coast. Coastal areas facilitated fishing, whaling, and hunting.Jesse Byock, Viking Age Iceland, (London: Penguin Books, 2001), 46. Sea birds, eggs, walrus, and lichens rounded out the Viking diet.Jesse Byock, Viking Age Iceland, (London: Penguin Books, 2001), 51-52. Viking farms had a significant impact on the landscape in Iceland. Wide scale erosion began in the land-taking stages of settlement.

The most severe attack was launched by the Royal Air Force in the early hours of 4 December 1943 and claimed more than 1,800 lives. Large parts of the city center were destroyed, while factories experienced temporary shortfalls in production, had to move production facilities or even were decentralized. At the outbreak of the war, Leipzig had more than 700,000 inhabitants and was therefore the sixth-largest city of the ‚ÄúGreater German Reich‚Äù (including Vienna). Leipzig additionally had significance by hosting the leading trade fair of the German Empire. The Erla Maschinenwerk aircraft factory that produced Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter planes at the three locations of Heiterblick, Abtnaundorf and Mockau were important for warfare. Additionally, Leipzig was an important railroad intersection in Germany at that time.  Attacks  First attacks = Prior to 1942, Leipzig had been considered relatively safe from potential aerial assaults because of the long flight route from Britain. But after the attack on Kassel on 22‚Äì23 October 1943, it became clear that British bombers were able to reach central Germany. On 27 March 1943, bombs were dropped by British aircraft setting Gohlis on fire. In the night of 31 August to 1 September, the British RAF Bomber Command carried out minor attacks on the towns of Eutritzsch and Sch√∂nefeld causing four casualties. = 4 December 1943 = During the night of 2 December 1943, the Royal Air Force once again attacked Berlin. Meanwhile, the German night fighters had prepared for these attacks and were able to shoot down 40 bombers. The following night, Leipzig was the target of an attack. The air route of this attack had been planned in a way to keep the German Air Defense in the dark about the attack's objective for as long as possible. Because the Germans did not expect an assault at this time, the Royal Air Force launched its attack in the early morning hours. The route the bomber squadrons were following crossed over the continental coastline at the Zuiderzee, continued eastwards to Northern Germany and Berlin and turned southwards over the area of the city of Brandenburg. Between 3:50 a.m and 4:25 a.m., 442 bombers dropped a total amount of almost 1400 tons of explosives and fire bombs. At 3.39 a.m. the air raid warning had been raised, with the all-clear following at 5:39 a.m. In the city centre, where the buildings were densely crowded, the air raid caused a firestorm. Hans Rumpf, the general inspector of fire fighting, happened to be in Leipzig during the attack. He said the firestorm was even more intense than the one in Hamburg during Operation Gomorrah. Firefighters had to be called from the hinterland, as the firebrigade of Leipzig had had to send half of their own forces to Berlin. These external forces were often not able to fight the flames, because their hoses did not fit the custom-made connections to the hydrants in Leipzig, of which only 30% had been standardised. Moreover, the water supply broke down quickly. More than 1800 people were killed in the attack. This is a small number for such a heavy attack, because many inhabitants did not follow the instruction to stay in the cellars until the all-clear was given, and so escaped the firestorm flames. In the city centre many historical buildings fell victim to the attack, namely the Old and the New Theatre, the New Trade Exchange, the nave of St. John's Church (Johanniskirche), the Old Balance (Alte Waage), St. Matthew‚Äôs Church (Matth√§ikirche), the Museum of Fine Art, the Caf√© Zimmermann (a favourite of J.S. Bach), and the Augusteum, the main building of the University. The roof truss of the Old Town Hall burned out; a concrete ceiling that had been installed at the beginning of the 20th century during a renovation prevented a burning out of the storeys below. As another consequence of the attack the destruction of 1,067 commercial buildings, 472 factory buildings, 56 schools, 29 fair buildings and 9 churches was recorded. 58 out of 92 departments of the University of Leipzig were hit and partially destroyed, including the first psychology laboratory, founded by Wilhelm Wundt. = 20 February 1944 = During the so-called Big Week, Leipzig was one of the first targets that were attacked by British and American bombers. On 20 February 1944 between 3.15 am and 4.20 am residential areas in the south (Connewitz) as well as residential and industrial areas in the southwest of Leipzig (Schleu√üig and Gro√üzschocher) were hit. During this night raid more than 700 bombers, which dropped about 2300 tons of bombs, were used. In the afternoon of the same day, more than 200 bombers of the 8th US Air Force attacked industrial facilities in the northeast of the city, using about 700 tons of bombs. Amongst others, the (second) Gewandhaus (concert hall) was almost totally destroyed as a result of the attacks[12]. In total, about 970 people died, most of them during the British night raid. During the following day raid some of the bombed factories were damaged severely, e.g. 65% of the ‚ÄúErla Maschinenwerk‚Äù in Heiterblick was destroyed. In May 1944 its production had not entirely recovered yet, while the other bombed factories were working at full capacity again[13]. =Later= Modern Leipzig today In May 1944 more than 15,000 buildings were hit. Among them, more than 4,000 were destroyed completely, more than 1,000 heavily and over 10,000 slightly damaged. According to a preliminary official report from 30 December 1944, the regions which were mainly hit were the ring around the inner city, the directly adjacent areas to the west, north and east, as well as all the southern suburbs. The adjacent areas to the north and east were slightly affected, whereas no damage occurred in the outer west, southwest and northwest. About 140,000 people were left homeless. On 23 February 1945 Leipzig received two major bombings: one by the British, and another by the Americans.

It consists of 16 members primarily elected from 12 districts within the city. The Atlanta City Government is divided into three bodies: the legislative, executive and judicial branches. The Atlanta City Council serves as the legislative branch. City departments, under the direction of the mayor, constitute the executive branch and the Courts, the judicial branch. Legislative Branch The legislative body, consisting of the Council, makes the laws that govern the city. It is responsible for the development of policies which serve as operational standards and establishes the parameters for the administration of city government. Executive Branch The Executive body carries out the laws that have been instituted by the City Council. It is responsible for the day-to-day operations of city government. The City Charter A new charter was enacted in 1996 that reduced the representation of Council to 12 districts and three at large posts‚Äîeffective January 1998. The 1974 Charter resulted in many changes in Atlanta City government. Prior to its adoption, the legislative body was called the Board of Aldermen and each alderman was elected citywide. The 1974 charter changed the Board of Aldermen to the City Council; the vice-mayor to the president of the Council; and established 12 Council members to be elected from individual districts and six at-large posts. The administration of the day-to-day operation of city government was transferred to the executive branch, and legislative authority was vested in the Council. This system allows the Council to maintain a strong system of checks and balances. Legislation takes two forms‚Äîordinances and resolutions. An ordinance establishes a permanent rule of government. Every official act of the Council, having the force and effect of law, must be an ordinance. Ordinances must be read before the full Council at two regular meetings. There are exceptions, for example, a Charter amendment requires three readings. Resolutions usually express intent or support of various projects and enterprises or establish legislative policy of a general nature. Resolutions need be read only once and can be introduced and adopted at the same meeting. Standing Committees The standing committees of the Atlanta City Council meet to consider legislation and to make recommendations on each item. The Committees then report their actions to the full Council. Approximately 150 pieces of legislation are handled per meeting. Citizens have the opportunity to appear before a standing committee and to express their views on any piece of legislation. Comments from the public on matters related to zoning changes are heard by the Zoning Review Board, an independent body composed of appointed city residents. The Zoning Review Board meets once a month. The Council is required by law to hold a public hearings on certain matters including changes to the City Charter, changes to the City Code of Ordinances, tax increases, etc. Notification must be provided to residents in advance of any public hearing. Legislative Process Legislation can be introduced on the floor of Council by a Councilmember as a personal paper, or can come through a standing committee. In either case, almost all legislation goes before a committee for discussion at some time. After a paper has been through the committee process, it is voted on by the full Council. The Council may accept or reject the committee's recommendations. A majority vote is needed for adoption. When a paper is adopted by the Council, it goes to the mayor for signature. The paper must be approved or vetoed within seven days. If not signed or vetoed within that period, it automatically becomes law. If vetoed, the Council can override with a two-thirds vote. About the Atlanta City Council The president of the City Council is elected from the city at-large (citywide). The Council consists of 15 members, 12 elected from single-member districts and three elected at-large. The Council president presides at all meetings of the Council and votes in the case of a tie. The president of Council appoints chairs and members of the various committees, subject to rejection by a majority of the Council. The Council president exercises all powers and discharges all duties of the mayor in case of a vacancy in that office or during the disability of the mayor. Councilmembers are elected to four-year terms commencing with the first Monday in January. The most recent Atlanta City Council took office in January 2018. The members of the Council elect a president pro tempore each year to serve a one-year term beginning with the first meeting in January. The president pro tempore presides over the Council meetings in the president's absence. Beginning in 2014, Atlanta City Council members are paid an annual salary of $60,300 ($62,000 for the City Council President) for their service.

Shipping containers range from large reusable steel boxes used for intermodal shipments to the ubiquitous corrugated boxes. In the context of international shipping trade, \\"container\\" or \\"shipping container\\" is virtually synonymous with \\"intermodal freight container,\\" a container designed to be moved from one mode of transport to another without unloading and reloading.Dictionary of International Trade: \\"Container: ... must be b) specially designed to facilitate the carriage of goods by one or more modes of transport without intermediate reloading. ... Ocean shipping containers are generally 10, 20, 30, or 40 feet long ... and conform to ISO standards\\" TypesIntermodal freight containers= A flatcar with a 20 ft tanktainer and an open-top 20 ft container with canvas cover Freight containers are a reusable transport and storage unit for moving products and raw materials between locations or countries. There are about seventeen million intermodal containers in the world, and a large proportion of the world's long-distance freight generated by international trade is transported in shipping containers. In addition, it is estimated that several million of these containers have now been discarded due to the shipping cost of sending them back to their port of origin. Their invention made a major contribution to the globalization of commerce in the second half of the 20th century, dramatically reducing the cost of transporting goods and hence of long-distance trade. Specialized shipping containers include: high cube containers (providing an extra in height to standard shipping containers), pallet wides, open tops, side loaders, double door or tunnel-tainers, and temperature controlled containers. Another specialized container, known as Transtainer, is a portable fuel and oil freight container. The hybrid bulk fuel tank is originally intended for the construction, mining, logging and farming sectors. The tank can be used to transport and store bulk fuels as well as dangerous liquids, by road, rail and sea.Portable fuel, oil freight container =Corrugated box= Corrugated boxes are commonly used as shipping containers (more than 90% of all shipping containers are of this type). They are made of corrugated fiberboard which is lightweight, recyclable, and strong enough to ship a variety of products. =Wooden box= Wooden boxes are often used for shipping heavy and dense products. They are sometimes specified for shipments of government or military shipments. =Crate= A crate is a large container, often made of wood, used to transport large, heavy or awkward items. A crate has a self-supporting structure, with or without sheathing. Reusable plastic versions include: * Euro container * Systainer, for shipping tools. =Intermediate bulk shipping container= IBC. An intermediate bulk container (IBC, IBC Tote, IBC Tank) is a multi-use container employed for the general transport, storage, and handling of bulk fluids and materials. IBC tanks are compatible with, and resistant to, an extensive list of chemicals, acids, caustics, as well as inert materials and food grade consumables. IBCs are commonly manufactured from the following materials: * Plastic (High- Density Polyethylene) * Composite: Steel & Plastic * Carbon Steel * Stainless Steel (304 & 316/316L SS grades) Some IBC engineering models are foldable (collapsible) for space-saving breakdown following use. Flexible intermediate bulk container A Flexible intermediate bulk container, FIBC, big bag, bulk bag, or super sack is a standardized container in large dimensions for storing and transporting and storing granular products. It is often made of a woven synthetic material. =Bulk box= A bulk box, bulk bin, skid box, or tote box is a pallet size box used for storage and shipping of bulk quantities. =Drum= Example of steel drum Drums are cylindrical shipping containers made of steel, plastic or fiber. They are often used for liquids and granular materials. =Insulated= Insulated shipping containers are a type of packaging used to ship temperature sensitive products such as foods, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. They are used as part of a cold chain to help maintain product freshness and efficacy. =Pail= Some pails are used as shipping containers. =Unit load device= A \\"LD3-45\\" unit load device on a trailer A Unit Load Device, or ULD, is a container used to transport cargo on commercial aircraft. A ULD can be a pallet or container used to load luggage, freight, and mail on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled into a single unit. Since this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights. Each ULD has its own packing list, manifest, or tracking identification to improve control and tracking of contents =Specialized = A container for shipping weapons, with carrying handles Custom containers are used for shipments of products such as scientific instruments, weapons and aviation components. Customized cushioning, blocking and bracing, carrying handles, lift rings, locks, etc. are common to facilitate handling and to protect the contents. Often, these shipping containers are reusable. The reusable ifco tray (\\"international fruit container\\") is used in Europe for transportation of fruit, vegetables, and fish. Scrap Box containers with a removable floor are also used to transport scrap metal, grain and custom applications. Transit and flight cases Flight cases and transit cases are usually custom designed for shipping and carrying fragile equipment: audio visual, camera, instruments, etc. Although generally light in construction, they tend to have reinforced edges and corners. Road cases Road cases are often used for shipping musical instruments and theater props. Re-use Student apartments built out of shipping containers in Le Havre, France The widespread availability and relative cheapness of used intermodal shipping containers meant that architects began to consider them as an alternative to traditional building materials. Used shipping containers have been converted for use in housing, and as retail and office spaces. Examples of its use include the Cit√© A Docks student housing project in Le Havre, France; the Wenckehof container village in Amsterdam; the portable Puma City store in US cities; the food and retail Boxpark in London; the Dordoy Bazaar in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; the temporary mall Re:START in Christchurch, New Zealand built after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and as intensive-care units in temporary hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has however been pointed out there are problems with recycling shipping containers, that it may not be as ecologically friendly or cheap an option as it might appear. The containers may be coated with harmful chemicals such as chromate, phosphorus, and lead-based paints, while its wooden floors may be treated with toxic insecticides, and some cost and effort are involved in modifying containers to make them habitable. Others have noted various issues such as space constraint, insulation, and structural weakness if too much steel is cut out of the containers. Shipping containers are used in the film and television industry for building temporary sets. Shipping containers can be stacked on top of each other and used as reinforced scaffold that large-scale film sets can be built against. An example can be seen at Leavesden Studios, England; an area of the studio backlot is allocated to spare containers when not in use.

It is primarily a way to order and include prayers, and differs from Nusach Sefard (as used by the Hasidim) and Baladi-rite prayer, and still more from the Sephardic rite proper, in the placement and presence of certain prayers. Subdivisions Nusach Ashkenaz may be subdivided into the German or Western branch (Minhag Ashkenaz), used in Western and Central Europe, and the Polish/Lithuanian or Eastern branch (Minhag Polin), used in Eastern Europe, the United States and by some Israeli Ashkenazim, particularly those who identify as Litvak (\\"Lithuanian\\"). There are a number of minor differences between the Israeli and American Ashkenazi practice in that the Israeli practice follows some practices of the Vilna Gaon. In strictness, the term Minhag Ashkenaz applied only to the usages of German Jews south and west of the Elbe, such as the community of Frankfurt. North-Eastern German communities such as Hamburg regarded themselves as following Minhag Polin, though their musical tradition and pronunciation of Hebrew, and some of the traditions about the prayers included, were more reminiscent of the western communities than of Poland proper. The ritual of the United Kingdom (Minhag Anglia) is based on those of both Germany and Poland Hamburg.Apple, Raymond Minhag Anglia - a broader connotation See Singer's Siddur. History Leopold Zunz claimed that the Ashkenazi rite is descended from the ancient rite of Eretz Yisrael, while the Sephardi rite is descended from Babylonia.Leopold Zunz, Die gottesdienstlichen Vortr√§ge der Juden, historisch entwickelt, Frankfurt am Main 1892 Haham Moses Gaster, in his introduction to the prayer book of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews,Preface to the Book of Prayer of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation, London, 1901: reprinted in 1965 and subsequent editions. made exactly the opposite claim. To put the matter into perspective it must be emphasized that all Jewish liturgies in use in the world today are in substance Babylonian, with a small number of usages from Eretz Yisrael surviving the process of standardization: in a list of differences preserved from the time of the Geonim, most of the usages recorded as from Eretz Yisrael are now obsolete.Lewin, B. M., Otzar ·∏§illuf Minhagim. Medieval Ashkenazi scholars stated that the Ashkenazi rite is largely derived from the Seder Rav Amram Gaon and minor Talmudic tractate Massechet Soferim. This may be true, but in itself this does not support a claim of Babylonian origin as argued by Haham Gaster: as pointed out by Louis GinzbergGeonica. the Seder Rav Amram Gaon had itself been heavily edited to reflect the Old Spanish rite. The Ashkenazi rite also contains a quantity of early liturgical poetry from Eretz Yisrael that has been eliminated from other rites, and this fact was the main support for Zunz's theory. The earliest recorded form of the Ashkenazi rite, in the broadest sense, may be found in an early medieval prayer book called Machzor Vitry. This however, like the Siddur Rashi of a century later, records the Old French rite rather than the Ashkenazi (German) rite proper, though the differences are small: the Old French rite survives today only in the form of certain usages of the Appam community of North-West Italy. Both the Old French and the Ashkenazi rites have a loose family resemblance to other ancient European rites such as the Italian, Romaniote and Proven√ßal rites, and to a lesser extent to the Catalan and Old Spanish rites: the current Sephardic rite has since been standardized to conform with the rulings of the Geonim, thereby showing some degree of convergence with the Babylonian and North African rites. The community of Byzantine Jews of southern Italy produced such prominent works like the Sefer Yosippon, the Sefer Ahimaaz of Ahimaaz ben Paltiel, the Sefer Hachmoni of Shabbethai Donnolo, the Aggadath Bereshit and many Piyyutim.Magdalino, P. and Mavroudi, M. \\"The Occult Sciences in Byzantium\\", p. 293, 2006Kohen, E. \\"History of the Byzantine Jews: A Microcosmos in the Thousand Year Empire\\", p. 91, 2007D√∂nitz, S. \\"Historiography among Byzantine Jews: The case of Sefer Yosippon\\",Bowman, S. Jewish Responses to Byzantine Polemics from the Ninth through the Eleventh Centuries, 2010Howell, H. and Rogers, Z. A Companion to Josephus, 2016 The liturgical writings of these Romaniote Jews, especially the piyyutim (hymns), were influential in the development of the Ashkenazi Mahzor, as they found their way through Italy to Ashkenaz and are preserved to this day in most Ashkenazi mahzorim.Bowman, S. \\"Jews of Byzantium\\", p. 153 Cf.

Ashkenazi practices *Tefillin are worn on Chol HaMoed (except on Shabbat). (The original custom was to wear tefillin for the entire Shacharis and Musaf services, for weekday New Moon and Chol HaMoed prayers. Many today, particularly in Israel, do not wear tefillin on Chol HaMoed at all.) *Separate blessings are said for the arm tefillin and the head tefillin. *The second blessing before the Shema begins \\"Ahavah Rabbah\\" in the morning service and \\"Ahavas \`Olam\\" in the evening. *In the summer months the second blessing of the Amidah contains no reference to dew or rain (Sephardim insert the words morid ha-tal, \\"who makes the dew fall\\"). *The kedushah of shacharit begins \\"neqaddesh es shimcha\\", and the kedushah of mussaf begins \\"na'aritz'cha ve-naqdish'cha\\". *There is one standard wording for the \\"Birkas Ha-Shanim\\", with only small variations between summer and winter. *The Priestly Blessing (or Barechenu, which is a substitute for it) is said in minhah of fast days in general and not only on Yom Kippur. *The last blessing of the Amidah is \\"Sim Shalom\\" in the morning service and \\"Shalom Rav\\" in the afternoon and evening services. (Congregations which follow German or Israeli Ashkenaz customs recite Sim Shalom at Shabbat Mincha as well, because of the afternoon Torah reading.) *The Torah scroll is lifted and displayed to the congregation after the Torah reading rather than before. *It is customary to stand for Kaddish. *En Kelohenu concludes with a stanza about the making of incense. *Adon Olam has only five stanzas. *The morning service on Shabbos concludes with Anim Zemirot. *It is a binding custom to avoid Kitniyos on Passover. *Blessings are said over all four glasses of wine at the Passover Seder. *Selichos do not begin until the Shabbos before Rosh Hashanah. *One set of Hanukkah lights is lit by each member of a household. *The shammash is used to light the other Hanukkah lights.

The edge of the New York Crystal Palace can be seen at right. The Latting Observatory was a wooden tower in New York City built as part of the 1853 Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, adjoining the New York Crystal Palace. It was located on the North side of 42nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue across the street from the site of present-day Bryant Park. Conceived by Waring Latting and designed by architect William Naugle, the observatory was an octagonally-based, iron-braced wooden tower high adjoining the Crystal Palace, with landings at three levels on the structure, allowing visitors to see east into Queens, south into Staten Island, and west into New Jersey.Pollak, Michael. \\"F.Y.I.: Over the Bounding Pond\\", The New York Times, August 28, 2005.

New York University Press, 2002. . The original specifications of the observatory called for a steam elevator to be installed to service all three heights, but that would have been unprecedented, since the tallest elevator then in existence was only high. None of the accounts of the tower mention steam elevators, and so it would appear that they were never installed.Gray, Lee Edward \\"From Ascending Rooms to Express Elevators: A History of the Passenger Elevator in the 19th Century\\", pp. 25-26. Elevator World, Inc., 2002. . Ascent was possible using winding stairways with several intermediate landings.

The observatory burned down in a fire that started between midnight and 1:00 AM on August 30, 1856 in a cooper's shop located at 49 West 43rd Street. The fire spread rapidly and attracted spectators from around the city, with flames that were visible for miles around. Though the fire destroyed more than twelve buildings and several families were left homeless, there were no known injuries or fatalities related to the incident. The Hydeville Marble Works, which owned the observatory, suffered a loss of $100,000 on merchandise and structures, of which $17,500 was covered by four different insurance companies. The New York Times described the fire as \\"one of the most destructive conflagrations that has occurred in the City for a long time...\\" with property valued at a total of $150,000 destroyed, most of which was accounted for by the tower itself. The Times described the tower as a \\"conspicuous landmark, by which the traveler could ascertain his whereabouts\\" and that it would be \\"greatly missed\\" despite the fact that as an investment it was \\"a stupendous failure\\" that never paid a return on the $150,000 in capital stock raised to erect the structure.

Music The first band Ingenting (means \\"nothing\\" in Swedish) was formed 1974 and played covers of song by bands like The Who and Iggy & the Stooges. In 1977 the band Sk√§rholmens Gymnasiums Punkensemble was formed, the band changed name and became later KSMB. Since the band was not so popular yet they played at the local clubs in Sk√§rholmen, Stockholm in the beginning. The same year which KSMB was split up (1982), Johansson together with Janne Borgh formed the new band Strindbergs'. Strindberg just played a couple of years until 1985. Johansson then started up a band called John Lennon (which later changed its name to John Lenin, to get away from Yoko Ono's lawyers). In the 1990 his music turned in a different direction; his sound became more like Cornelis Vreeswijk. In 2006 a solo album came up 10 years after the last, the album came together with the book I st√§llet f√∂r vykort. The record contained a live-show with old and new material.

It is adjacent to the Wedge Plantation and just north of Harrietta Plantation. The plantation house was built around 1730. It is located just off US Highway 17 near the Santee River. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1975. History The house at Fairfield Plantation is believed to have been built by the Lynch family around 1730. In 1758, Jacob Motte, son of Jacob Motte who was provincial treasurer, and his wife Rebecca Brewton Motte obtained the house. Their daughters, Elizabeth and Frances, both married Thomas Pinckney in succession and the house was left to Pinckney. Pinckney then left the house to his son, Thomas Pinckney Jr who in turn left it to his nephew, Captain Thomas Pinckney. The plantation has remained in the Pinckney family for over 200 years. Architecture This is a Georgian style, clapboard house on a raised basement. It has central porches on the south and north elevations. Each is pedimented and supported by six Doric columns. Two columns are engaged. The south porch on the landside is supported by brick columns. The riverside north porch has brick arch supports. The porches were probably in the late 18th century. The house has a hip roof and two cross- shaped interior chimneys.Land side entrance circa 1970. The house originally had four rooms on the main floor and two rooms on the second floor. The latter rooms were facing the river. After Jacob Motte acquired the house, the second floor was squared out by adding two additional rooms. The main floor is taller than the second floor. There is a horizontal band on the exterior that separates the top floor from the main floor. The south facade has a pair of nine over nine lights on each side of the door. The second floor has six over six lights above each of the first floor windows. In the second story, there are pairs of six over six lights to the left and right of the porch gable. The east and west elevations each have three four over four lights on the first floor with shorter six over six lights above on the second floor. In the late 19th century bay windows were added, though they were subsequently removed toward the end of the 20th century. The second floor has a six over six light on each side of the porch roof just inside of the bay windows. There is small nine light window over the north door. The first floor has four rooms. The larger of the front rooms has the central front entrance. The smaller room on the left is connected to the large room by a single door. The two rear rooms are the same size. They are divided by the central hall with staircase. The front rooms have barrel-vaulted fireplaces with high mantels on their back walls. The left hand rear room has had small bathroom added at a later period. The floor plan of the basement is the same as the first floor. The upper floor has four rooms with small fireplaces.

The current head teacher is Christian Gr√ºtter. The school offers a musisches Profil, with a strong focus on music, and a neusprachliches Profil, with the focus being on modern languages, such as Italian and Spanish. The Kantonsschule K√ºsnacht offers a lot of extra curricular activities for their students. People can learn dance, parkour and take classes to prepare the numerus clausus. Next to that the student have the possibility to brew beer in their fifth year at the Kantonsschule. The high school is also famous for making their own wine. Behind the main building is a big field with a lot of grapes and the student cut the grapes that will later be made into a good, local wine.  Campus  The campus of the Kantonsschule K√ºsnacht is quite big. There is a very modern library, a big modern building, as well as two older buildings (one of them being the famous Johanniterhaus) and a cantina; a place where people eat lunch. Just next to the school there is a church, but they are not affiliated anymore.

Once accepted at the school there is a testing time, called the Probezeit, in which only the best students have the chance to stay at the school (out of an average class of 26 people, about 3 get kicked out even after having a good grade on the exam). If a student is twice in a row almost failing, the student has to repeat the year. Does it happen again, the student has to leave the school.  Academics  The Kantonsschule K√ºsnacht is known to be an artistic school, by having profiles that mostly profiles on the arts. Students have to choose a major when joining the school.

TheoriesPsychosis= Among the earliest psychological theories is the psychosis theory, advanced by Sigmund Freud.Freud, S. Totem and taboo: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics. London: Routledge Kegan Paul (1960). (Original work published 1913). According to this theory, ‚Äúprimitive man‚Äù is not a rational being, and in fact magical thinking bears a strong resemblance to neuroses. However, this conclusion has come into question, as more recent psychological theory acknowledges that psychological testing does not cross cultures with complete accuracy.Gleitman, H., Reisberg, D., & Gross, J. Psychology, 7th edition. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Co (2007). =Bad science= In contrast, the ‚Äúbad science‚Äù model claims that primitive man is rational, and magical beliefs come into existence as he tries to explain puzzling phenomena without enough information. According to this theory, the magician is an early form of scientist who merely lacks adequate data. In Edward Burnett Tylor‚Äôs version of this theory, the magician‚Äôs folly is in mistaking an ideal connection for a real one; the magician believes that thematically-linked items can influence one another by virtue of their similarity.Evans-Pritchard, E.E. Theories of Primitive Religion. Oxford: Oxford University Press (1977), p.p. 26-27. For example, the Azande rub crocodile teeth on banana plants to make them fruitful (because crocodile teeth grow continuously). The property of fertility can spread from a symbol of fertility (the crocodile tooth) to the intended target (the banana tree). Michael F. Brown observes that many Aguaruna taboos can be understood as preventing undesired connections. =Symbolic action= The symbolic action theory understands magic as a course of action taken when there exists an emotional (psychological) need for action, but no practical option exists. In R.R. Marett‚Äôs example, it is a magical action when a man, betrayed by his mistress, gathers photographs of her and burns them.R.R. Marett. The Threshold of Religion, 2nd edition. (1914). Summary courtesy of Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion, p.p. 33-34. This interpretation presents a modern analog of the voodoo doll. As Marett describes, if the emotional situation proves common enough, the response becomes a socially-codified norm which outsiders understand as magic and which Marett labels ‚Äúdeveloped magic‚Äù. Claude L√©vi-StraussL√©vi-Strauss, Claude. The Effectiveness of Symbols. and Ariel GlucklichGlucklich, Ariel. The End of Magic. New York: Oxford University Press (1997). expand upon symbolic theory, positing that magic can serve as a form of psychotherapy or New Age science, accomplishing real results by what amounts to the placebo effect. The effects of such magic would be made real through its effect on the individual person as demonstrated in their life and actions. =Anxiety relief= According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger and little to do about it. Magic is used to restore a sense of control. In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.Keinan, Giora. The effects of stress and desire for control on superstitious behavior. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin Vol. 28, No. 1. Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc. (2002). It is proposed that one reason (but not necessarily the only reason) for the persistence of magic rituals is that the ritual activates vigilance-precaution systems ‚Äì that is to say, that the rituals prompt their own use by creating a feeling of insecurity and then proposing themselves as precautions.Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Li√©nard. Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals. Association for Psychological Science (2008). Pascal Boyer and Pierre Li√©nard propose that the shape rituals take results from goal demotion and attentional focus on lower level representation.Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Li√©nard. Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals. Association for Psychological Science (2008). Levels of representation were previously described by J.M. Zacks and Barbara Tversky.Zacks, J.M. and B. Tversky. Event structure in perception and conception. Psychological Bulletin, 127, 3-21. (2001). At the lowest level are simple gestures (such as putting the left foot in a shoe). At the mid-level are behavioral episodes (such as putting one‚Äôs shoes on). At the highest level are scripts (such as getting dressed to go out). Ordinarily, people describe and recall behavior in terms of the middle level of behavioral episodes. In studies of obsessive-compulsive rituals, focus shifts to the lower level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface. The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act. Debate remains as to whether studies of obsessive-compulsive rituals can be extended to describe other kinds of rituals.

BiographyYouth= Quincy Tahoma was born near Tuba City, Arizona on Christmas Day 1921. Tahoma means \\"Water Edge\\".Quincy (Water Edge) Tahoma (1921‚Äì1956). AskArt. (retrieved 18 May 2009) As a young boy he became familiar with many religious and traditional chants and rituals. He also was known for creating \\"sand paintings.\\" As a boy he spent much of his time hunting and fishing, and later in life he drew much of his artistic inspiration from his boyhood experiences. =Santa Fe (Dorothy Dunn Studio)= Tahoma studied art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, from 1936 to 1940, where he attended the Santa Fe Indian School. He was one of many Navajo painters among the most successful artists to be trained by Dorothy Dunn at the Studio, at the Santa Fe Indian School. Other Navajo painters in that program at the time included Harrison Begay, Gerald Nailor, Sr. and Andy Tsinajinnie. Style Early in his career, his paintings were serene and soothing in tone, but increasingly they had subject matter of bloody wars and men killing animals. In retrospect, Tahoma's subjects were traditional Indian pursuits such as riding, fishing, and hunting, and he also painted distinctive landscape scenes. He was known for his brilliant colors and precise lines along with the two-dimensional disposition of his work reflected the nature of American Indian painting in the American Southwest at that time. His imaginative style and elegant designs distinguished him from his peers. Rather than posing his subjects in a static manner, Tahoma painted them in action. For early 20th-century, studio-taught painting, Tahoma incorporated more action and varied techniques in his work. ‚ÄúOne of the most dynamic, imaginative and gifted of Southwest Indian artists was Quincy Tahoma. He also revealed in his works the extreme rhythm and decorative feelings that are essentially Indian. Tahoma lived the life of an average Navajo boy, herding sheep and riding horseback,‚Äù wrote art historian Clara Lee Tanner. Career Tahoma spent most of his life in Santa Fe, working on hundreds of paintings over two decades from the mid-1930s to 1956 as a Navajo painter and muralist. It is of much debate if Quincy Tahoma was also one of the Navajo Code talkers, who played such a critical part in the winning of World War II in the Pacific. It is believed to some that Tahoma joined the armed forces and served in the Signal Corps during World War II and that after the war, he returned to the Navajo Reservation and became a successful artist.

Hearst Museum of Anthropologyhttp://pahma.berkeley.edu/delphi/object/81220 Death He died of alcoholism in November 1956 in Santa Fe. He left behind a tremendous legacy of art that is still remembered by those familiar with the field. Due in large measure to his premature death, Tahoma's contribution to Native American art, as well as the triumphs and tragedies in his life, have remained somewhat invisible to the generations that followed.

It is the band's newest studio album since 2002. Background and details After Honeymoon Suite's original lineup (circa 1984) reunited to tour Canada in the summers of 2007 and 2008, they returned to the studio to record a new album with their original producer and current manager, Tom Tremeuth. The first single released to radio was \\"Tired O' Waitin' on You\\". The album title is an homage to the cluster of tourist attractions on Clifton Hill in the band's hometown of Niagara Falls, Ontario. As guitarist Derry Grehan explained in an interview with The Niagara Falls Review: \\"I think our best record was The Big Prize, and the new songs were kind of sounding like that. Riffy, simple with big choruses. So with Johnnie and I paying homage to our roots, we thought (for a title) ... 'Lundy's Lane?' No. Trying to find a name for a record after the fact is hard. At one point Clifton Hill came up. I thought it had a nice feel for an album title. Easy to remember. I can't explain it, it just kind of works.\\" The photograph used for the album's cover was taken by Russell Harbottle in 1985.

In its original formulation as a proverb and metaphor for credulity with roots in fable, this refers to the perception of a simpleton who sees a reflection of the Moon in water and mistakes it for a round cheese wheel. It is widespread as a folkloric motif among many of the world's cultures, and the notion has also found its way into children's folklore and modern popular culture. The phrase \\"green cheese\\" in the common version of this proverb (sometimes \\"cream cheese\\" is used), may refer to a young, unripe cheese or to cheese with a greenish tint. There was never an actual historical popular belief that the Moon is made of green cheese (cf. Flat Earth and the myth of the Flat Earth). It was typically used as an example of extreme credulity, a meaning that was clear and commonly understood as early as 1638. Fable There exists a family of stories, in comparative mythology in diverse countries that concern a simpleton who sees a reflection of the Moon and mistakes it for a round cheese: =The Wolf and the Fox story type= This folkloric motif is first recorded in literature during the High Middle Ages by the French rabbi Rashi with a Rabbinic parable in his commentary weaving together three Biblical quotations given in the main text (including one on \\"sour grapes\\") into a reconstruction of some of the Talmudic Rabbi Meir's supposed three hundred fox fables (\\"◊û◊©◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ï◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ù\\", in later works \\"◊û◊©◊ú◊ô ◊©◊ï◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ù\\"), in the tractate Sanhedrin: Rashi as the first literary reference may reflect the well-known beast fable tradition of French folklore or a more obscure such tradition in Jewish folklore (see also the tradition in Berechiah ha-Nakdan); the near- contemporary Iraqi rabbi Hai Gaon also reconstructed this Rabbi Meir tale, sharing some elements of Rashi's story, but with a lion caught in a trapping pit rather than a wolf in a well ‚Äì however, Rashi may have actively \\"adapted contemporary [French] folklore to the [T]almudic passage\\", as was homiletically practiced in different Jewish communities. Though the tale itself is probably of non-Jewish European origin, Rashi's form and elements are likely closer to the original in oral folklore than the somewhat later variation recorded featuring Reynard. Rashi's version already includes the fox, the wolf, the well and the Moon that are seen in later versions. Petrus Alphonsi, a Spanish Jewish convert to Christianity, popularized this tale in Europe in his collection Disciplina Clericalis. The wolf is tempted by the Moon's reflection. The variation featuring Reynard the Fox appeared soon after Petrus Alphonsi in the French classic Le Roman de Renart (as \\"Renart et Ysengrin dans le puits\\" in Branch IV); the Moon/cheese element is absent (it is replaced by a promise of Paradise at the bottom of the well), but such a version is alluded to in another part of the collection. This was the first Reynard tale to be adapted into English (as the Middle English \\"√æe Vox and √æe Wolf\\"), preceding Chaucer's \\"The Nun's Priest's Tale\\" and the much later work of William Caxton. Later still, the Middle Scots The Fox, the Wolf and the Husbandman does include the Moon/cheese element. La Fontaine includes the story in the French classic compilation Fables (\\"Le Loup et le Renard\\" in Book XI). The German tale of The Wolf and the Fox in Grimm replaces the well with a well-stocked cellar, where a newly satiated wolf is trapped and subject to the farmer's revenge, being now too overstuffed to escape through the exit. One of the facets of this morphology is grouped as \\"The Wolf Dives into the Water for Reflected Cheese\\" (Type 34) of the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification of folktales, where the Moon's reflection is mistaken for cheese, in the section devoted to tales of The Clever Fox. It can also be grouped as \\"The Moon in the Well\\" (Type 1335A), in the section devoted to Stories about a Fool, referring to stories where the simpleton believes the Moon itself is a tangible object in the water. Proverb \\"The Moon is made of green cheese\\" was one of the most popular proverbs in 16th and 17th-century English literature, and it was also in use after this time. It likely originated in this formulation in 1546, when The Proverbs of John Heywood claimed \\"the moon is made of a greene cheese.\\"\\"Ye fetch circumquaques to make me believe, Or thinke, that the moone is made of greene cheese. And when ye have made me a lout in all these, It seemeth ye would make me goe to bed at noone.\\" --John Heywood. Greene may refer here not to the color, as many now think, but to being new or unaged. Cf. green wood. A common variation at that time was \\"to make one believe the Moon is made of green cheese\\" (i.e., to hoax). In French, there is the proverb \\"Il veut prendre la lune avec les dents\\" (\\"He wants to take the moon with his teeth\\"), alluded to in Rabelais. The characterization is also common in stories of gothamites, including the Moonrakers of Wiltshire, who were said to have taken advantage of this trope, and the assumption of their own naivete, to hide their smuggling activities from government officials. Childlore A 1902 survey of childlore by psychologist G. Stanley Hall in the United States found that though most young children were unsure of the Moon's composition, that it was made of cheese was the single most common explanation: Before that time, and since, the idea of the Moon actually being made of cheese has appeared as a humorous conceit in much of children's popular culture with astronomical themes (cf. the Man in the Moon), and in adult references to it. In epistemology At the Science Writers' conference, theoretical physicist Sean M. Carroll explained why there was no need to \\"sample the moon to know it's not made of cheese.\\" He said the hypothesis is \\"absurd\\", failing against our knowledge of the universe and, \\"This is not a proof, there is no metaphysical proof, like you can proof a statement in logic or math that the moon is not made of green cheese. But science nevertheless passes judgments on claims based on how well they fit in with the rest of our theoretical understanding.\\"This hypothetical debateessentially a straw man proposal or argument ignores completely the personal observation and collection of 382 kg (842 lb) of moon rock by Apollo program astronauts. Compare Cromwell's rule. Notwithstanding this uncontrovertible argument, the harmonic signature of moon rockthe seismic velocity at which shockwaves travelis said to be closer to cheese than to any rock on earth. Dennis Lindley used the myth to help explain the necessity of Cromwell's rule in Bayesian probability: \\"In other words, if a decision-maker thinks something cannot be true and interprets this to mean it has zero probability, he will never be influenced by any data, which is surely absurd. So leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese; it can be as small as 1 in a million, but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with samples of the said cheese will leave you unmoved.\\" See also * Cheese Factories on the Moon * Cromwell's rule * Face value * Giant impact hypothesis for theories on the origin and make up of the Moon * History of cheese * Ipse dixit‚Äîcompare * Little Cheese (real name Chester Cheese), fictional character in the DC comic, featuring a type of cheese found on the Moon by an astronaut * Moon in fiction * Olivine * Skepticism * Splitting of the moon ReferencesNotesCitationsBibliography=    External links * Category:Moon myths Category:English proverbs Category:Cheese Category:Metaphors referring to food and drink ","title":"The Moon is made of green cheese"},{"id":"22849777","text":"Roxton is a small village and civil parish in the Borough of Bedford, Bedfordshire, England about north-east of the county town of Bedford. The 2011 census gives the population of Roxton as 348. Geography Roxton is southwest of St Neots, west of Cambridge and north of Central London. Area The civil parish covers an area of . The River Great Ouse forms the parish's eastern and most of its southern boundary, and the A421 road its western. Landscape The village lies within the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands as designated by Natural England. Bedford Borough Council classifies the local landscape as the Great Ouse Clay Valley. The surrounding area is mostly arable farmland. Roxton Park is an area of grassland dotted with mature trees. There are lakes formed from old sand and gravel pits in the southeast corner of the parish by the Ouse. A sand and gravel quarry is being worked east of the Black Cat Roundabout by Breedon Aggregates. Elevation The village centre is above sea level. The whole parish is low lying and flat. Geology and soil type The village lies mainly on third terrace river gravel. Boulder clay is to the south and west, and first and second terrace river gravel to the east. Alluvium borders the Great Ouse. Underlying these superficial deposits is Oxford clay and Kellaways beds. Around the village the soil has low fertility, is freely draining and slightly acid with a loamy texture. The southwestern part of the parish has highly fertile, lime-rich loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage. By the Great Ouse are loamy and clayey floodplain soils with naturally high groundwater. The night sky and light pollution Light pollution is the level of radiance (night lights) shining up into the night sky. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted. Roxton in band 5 and 6 is adversely affected by lighting along the A1/A421 Black Cat Roundabout. The night sky is darker looking northwest. A1 road bridges The A1 northbound carriageway is carried over the Ouse by a sandstone bridge built in October 1820. Listing particulars state the bridge to be about long and wide. There are three broad, low arches built with blocks of Bramley Fall stone from a quarry near Leeds. A rounded towpath archway passes through the east abutment. A sandstone parapet rests on a projecting stone string course. Except where replaced by concrete, Bramley Fall stone copings run the length of the bridge. Inscriptions of masons can be seen on the inside face of the copings over the crown of the centre arch. Flood bridges to the east and west have seven smaller and lower segmental brick arches. A separate bridge was built for the southbound carriageway when the road was dualled in the early 1960s. Public footpaths The Ouse Valley Way pases through the village and runs alongside the Ouse to the south and east. History In the 1970s, a Bronze Age barrow cemetery in the form of five ring ditches was excavated prior to gravel extraction. Two urned primary cremation burials were found. The site, near to the Ouse, is now a lake. Archaeological evidence of Romano-British occupation was found in trences dug in 2007 east of the Black Cat roundabout. Roxton is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The entry reads: Rochesdone/stone: Rhiwallon from Hugh de Beauchamp; William Speke. Mill (260 eels). The hamlets of Chawston and Colesden were part of Roxton civil parish until 1 April 2007, when they together with Wyboston (part of Roxton parish from 1965) separated to form a new civil parish. Governance Roxton Parish Council has seven elected members and meets bi-monthly in the parish hall. Roxton is part of Wyboston ward for elections to the Borough of Bedford Unitary Authority. Prior to 1894, Roxton was administered as part of the Barford Hundred. From 1894 until 1974 the village was in Bedford Rural District and since 1974 in Bedford Borough. The village was in Bedford parliamentary constituency until 1997. Now in North East Bedfordshire, the elected member is Alistair Burt of the Conservative Party. Village facilities The Royal Oak public house has been licensed since at least 1819. A post office is in a courtyard to the rear. Roxton CE Academy caters for up to 90 girls and boys aged from 3 to 11 years and is governed locally under the auspices of The Diocese of St Albans Multi- Academy Trust. The school buildings date from 1963. Roxton Garden Centre on Bedford Road includes a restaurant and maze. Public transport Roxton is served by the regional Stagecoach X5 bus route; east to St Neots and Cambridge and west to Bedford, Milton Keynes and Oxford. The nearest railway stations are Sandy and St Neots. Church and chapel The Grade II* listed Parish Church of St Mary Magdalene dates from the 14th century and is built of rich brown cobblestones with ashlar dressings and slate roofs. The 15th century western tower is single‚Äìstage with northeast and southwest buttresses to an embattled parapet. There is a ring of five bells; the oldest are dated 1591 and 1607. The church is in the Biggleswade Deanery and the Diocese of St Albans. Along with the ecclesiastical parishes of Blunham, Great Barford and Tempsford with Little Barford, Roxton is part of the Riversmeet Benefice. Roxton Congregational Chapel The Roxton Congregational Chapel, also Grade II* listed, originates from 1808, when meetings were held in a barn. The chapel was formerly established in 1822 and the barn converted into a thatched Cottage orn√© style chapel. In the 1830s two wings were added; one for the vestry and the other for the village school and Sunday School. The chapel is an independent Christian church affiliated to the Congregational Federation. The Church had a pastor until at least 1947 but nowadays external preachers come from a variety of denominations. Administration of the church is by three, annually elected, voluntary deacons. Decision‚Äìmaking is by Church members through the Church meeting. Community events Roxton Flower Show is held annually in August. According to the Parish Council website the 2019 show was the 65th such event. Notable people * Wayne Larkins, a former Northamptonshire and England cricketer was born in Roxton.

Construction  Southport boats are built in the company's production plant in South Gardiner, Maine.http://www.southportboats.com/construction/ All Southports, like most other sport fishing boats, are made of fiberglass. The hull of the boat is made in a pre-fabricated mold, where the outer layer of gelcoat is applied first, then the layers of fiberglass. After the exterior hull is completed, the grid system is installed into the hull. A bonding agent called methacrylate is applied to ensure a complete bond with the grid system (the interior skeleton of the boat). The grid system is similar to the stringer system of older boats, but provides added strength because it is one integral piece including fore and aft as well as laterally running structural beams. The hull grid system, as well as any compartments not used for storage or fuel cells, are then completely filled with foam for basic flotation and vibration reduction.Lazarus, Paul: \\"Start-Up\\", pages 38-61, Professional Boatbuilder, June/July 2005, retrieved on 5/5/2009. The next step involves installing all wiring and assorted tanks and pumps. The grid system provides placement for all of these items, and a way to organize the wiring. The cockpit liner, or \\"main deck,\\" is then bonded to the hull and stringer system with more methacrylate. Some of the parts, like the driving console, helm seats, and leaning post are constructed off-line and then installed into the completed hulls. After being detailed, the boats are wrapped in plastic from the gunwale up in order to protect the boat from damage during shipping.

Marine Embedded Training Team 6-4 as well as other US units provided air support, both with attack helicopters and A-10 and F-15E strike aircraft. The operation enabled the construction of two bases for the Afghan Army in the Alasay valley, which had been guerrilla control since 2006.  Context  French troops and armor in the Alasai Valley, April 2009. The sector of Alasay valley, in Kapisa Province, had been under guerrilla control since 2006. The ISAF decided to regain control of the sector. Given the proximity of two ISAF bases near the village of Nijrab and in Tagab, the French Groupement tactique interarmes de Kapisa (GTIA), harboured there, was tasked with the mission. The GTIA is composed of * the 27th chasseurs alpins Battalion (27 BCA) * elements of the 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment (93 RAM) * elements of the 2nd Foreign Engineering Regiment (2 REG) * elements of the 4th chasseurs regiment (4 RC) * elements of the 28th Communication Regiment (28 RT). * the Mountain Commando Group (GCM) The 4th Company of the 27 RC received the callsign Vert (\\"Green\\"); it was composed of several section, label Vert 20, Vert 30, Vert 40. The 2nd Company received the callsign of Jonquille (Narcissus pseudonarcissus; by tradition, chasseurs alpins never utter the word \\"yellow\\", but use the colour of the plant as a metonymy). The plan envisioned construction of two outposts for the Afghan Army.CHRONOLOGIE de la bataille d'Alasay (op√©ration Dinner out) , Jean Guisnel, Le Point The battle 14 March = At 4:30, the 4th company of the 27 BCA departed Nijrab in four CH-47 Chinook helicopters and occupied heights commanding the Southern region of Alasay valley, with Vert 10 directly above the points where the outposts were to be built; Vert 20 and Vert 30 covering the surrounding; and Vert 70 threatening the access path from the South. Around the same time, elements of the Afghan Army, with several armoured vehicles and two battle tanks, approached their destination. They were supported by the 2nd Company of the 27 BCA and by the GCM. Over the following hours, two mortar sections of the 93 RAM, labeled Vert 60 and Jonquille 60, were installed South of Alasay valley, as forwards elements were now out of range for support from Tagab base. At 7:17, elements of the Afghan Army came under fire; Jonquille 40 answered in kind, firing several Milan missiles. Four minutes later, Jonquille 20 found itself under sporadic dragunov fire, which stopped to reoccur half an hour later, without causing casualties. Vert 30 was under fire, and called for air support, provided at 8:00 by elements of the US Air Force. Around the same time, three AMX-10 RC moved to the village of Shekut. Meanwhile, the 2nd company of the Afghan Army refused to move forwards; the captain was relieved of duty, the soldiers dispatched to other companies, and the 1st Afghan company took over, moving towards Alasay Valley. It arrived 5 minutes later with the GCM and the AMX-10 RC, only to come under fire from two guerrilla units 600 metres away. These positions were pounded by the armoured unit and put out of action, allowing Jonquille 30 to close in and destroy it with small arm fire. At 8:45, Jonquille 20 moved to support Jonquille 30 and provide assistance to two wounded of the Afghan Army. At the same time, guerrilla elements stormed the positions of Vert 30 and Vert 20, while US helicopters pounded caves occupied by the guerrilla. At 9:30, Jonquille 30 sustained sniper fire, prompting the deployment of two 20mm-equipped VAB-C20 to complement Jonquille 20 and 30. During the following hours, several sporadic engagements took place around Alasay. The French sustained their first casualty at 12:51, when a Milan operator of Vert 30 came under Dragunov fire and was wounded by shrapnel after the launcher was hit. The soldier was evacuated to Bagram at 14:41. Between 15:00 and 15:30, guerrilla elements attempted to infiltrate between Vert 20 and Vert 30, but were prevented by small arms fire and air support. An apparent calm was then restored, though women were seen evacuating the sector. At 18:00, guerrilla units showed themselves all around Alasay and stormed the village, while at the same time, Vert 20 and Vert 30 were also attacked; fighting lasted for one hour before the guerrilla broke contact under the cover of a hail of RPGs. One of the rockets hit a VAB-C20, killing the driver, Corporal Nicolas Belda. Over the following hours, guerrilla elements retreated to the East, while the ISAF forces strengthened their positions. The dead and 5 Afghan Army wounded were evacuated at 22:10. = 15 March = From midnight, Vert 20 and 30 left the sector on foot, supported by the GCM, and rejoined Tagab. At 6:47, Jonquille 30 destroyed a guerrilla group attempting to storm Alasay. At 7:00, elements of the Afghan Army arrived on BMP vehicles. One hour later, construction of the outposts began. Vert 20 and 30 departed around 14:00. = 16 and 17 March = Late in the evening of the 16th, Vert 10 and Vert 70 departed by helicopter. The next day at 18:00, the outpost of Alasay was completed and construction of the second outpost began in Shekut. Aftermath After the fighting had ended, several guerrilla groups were persuaded by local tribal elders to lay down their arms, in exchange for amnesty and cash incentives. While their long-term commitment to peace remains doubtful, the coalition offensive in Alasay, along with a government-sponsored reconciliation process, is said to have caused a clear improvement in the security situation, according to local leaders.

Situated on next to the Madawaska River, it has more than 80,000 plants, making it the largest arboretum east of Montreal. The Botanical Garden opens in early May and is open daily for the summer season. In addition to the Botanical Gardens, the Province of New Brunswick also maintains an antique automobile museum on the same grounds. The Trans Canada Trail also passes beside by the park. History Ducks in the Mist The Botanical Garden opened in June 1993. A lack of operating funds nearly caused it to close a few years after its inauguration. The garden was rescued by leaders of the University of Moncton Campus at Edmundston (UMCE), which was subsequently given the mandate to manage the Garden from 1997 to 2007. In November 2006, the UMCE informed the Province of New-Brunswick, Tourism and Parks Department, that they would not renew their management contract and on June 21, 2007 the City of Edmundston signed an agreement with the minister of Tourism and Parks for New Brunswick for one-year management of the Garden. Ultimately, the City declined to get involved directly with the management and that mandate was transferred to the New Brunswick Botanical Garden Society. A five-year agreement was signed in April 2008 between these three organizations to ensure the functioning and long-term development of the Garden. Mission New Brunswick Botanical Garden The New Brunswick Botanical Garden (NBBG) subscribes to the \\"mission\\" of most of the largest botanical gardens. This general mission has been defined by the International Agenda for Botanical Gardens in Conservation and can be summarized as follows: * Slow the loss of plant species and their genetic diversity. * Concentrate on the prevention of degradations in worldwide natural environments. * Increase public awareness and comprehension on the value of plant diversity and potential threats. * Engage in practical actions for the benefit and improvement of the natural environment. * Promote and ensure sustainable management of natural resources by present generations and those to come. The accomplishment of the mission asks botanical gardens to undertake a large range of activities as suggested in the Agenda. However, as botanical gardens cannot accomplish this mission on their own, they need to work in partnership with many institutions, societies, communities and individuals. Displays Butterflies of the WorldThere are several display areas in the Botanical Garden, some of which vary from year to year. Recent dicplays have included: =Butterflies of the World= This permanent display, situated in the main pavilion, features blue morphos from the tropical forests of South and Central America. =Charles Darwin= The exhibition is called \\"Charles Darwin and the Idea of Evolution\\" and it presents Darwin's life, challenges, observations and stunning discoveries. The exhibition took place from June 18 to September 30, 2009. =Birds and Colours= \\"Birds and Colors\\" was a live exhibition that was presented during the 2008 summer season. More than 50 species of birds from all around the world were presented. Some of the birds remained in certain exhibitions in 2009. =Tulips= Starting mid-May, approximately 10,000 bulbs distributed into forty varieties of tulips, crocus are planted and bloom early in the season. Blooming typically occurs from mid- May to mid-June. =Mosaiculture= The Peafowl, mosaiculture.The mosaiculture is a form of art which uses plants to accomplish drawings. The origin of mosaicultures traces back to the embroidery bed of 16th and 17th centuries. At the end of the 1860s, the term \\"mosaiculture\\" was used for the first time at the parc de la T√™te d'Or in Lyon. In the beginning, gardeners created simple geometric forms but over the years, mosaiculture has become more complex and has come to include such three-dimensionsl shapes as butterflies, vases and birds. The Gardens have several such examples on display. Today, several cities practice this art which is a tool of flowers development and horticultural expression.2003\\\\.

His wife Ossi (Ronit Elkabetz), a vain, self- centered woman, just makes everybody's life difficult. The couple's daughter, Mali Wolf (Dana Ivgy), has secretly fallen in love with her childhood friend, the young Toufik (newcomer Mahmud Shalaby), a hard-working youth who has come as a helping hand to his Israeli-Arab father Hassan, a long-time mechanic working for Reuven. Meanwhile, Reuven's son Meir (Roy Assaf) resents working in the garage and further resents the presence of Arab Palestinian Toufik, and bullies him around. In a most tragic night, everybody's life is changed. Meir and his mother have a grave argument and she throws him out. Next morning, a crisis erupts between Meir and Toufik with the latter fatally injuring Meir in an unfortunate accident. This cancels the plan the already pregnant Mali and her lover Toufik had made to elope. Although she decides to have an abortion so as not to have a baby from her brother's killer, she eventually decides to keep the baby, concealing that the child is from Toufik, and the devastated Wolf family moves to Ramat Gan.

It was constructed in 1867 in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austrian Empire, and was used until it was demolished by the fascist authorities in 1941 in the Axis-aligned Independent State of Croatia. The Moorish Revival synagogue, designed after the Leopoldst√§dter Tempel in Vienna, was located on modern-day Pra≈°ka Street. It has been the only purpose-built Jewish house of worship in the history of the city. It was one of the city's most prominent public buildings, as well as one of the most esteemed examples of synagogue architecture in the region. Since the 1980s, plans have been made to rebuild the synagogue in its original location. Due to various political circumstances, very limited progress has been made. Major disagreements exist between the government and Jewish organizations as to how much the latter should be involved in decisions about the reconstruction project, including proposed design and character of the new building. History Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first permanently settled in Zagreb in the late eighteenth century, and founded the Jewish community in 1806. In 1809 the Jewish community had a rabbi, and by 1811 it had its own cemetery. As early as 1833, the community was permitted to buy land for construction of a synagogue, but did not have sufficient money to finance one at the time. By 1855, the community had grown to 700 members and, on October 30 of that year, the decision was made to build a new Jewish synagogue. The construction committee, appointed in 1861, selected and purchased a parcel of land at the corner of Maria Valeria Street (now Pra≈°ka Street) and Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square, the central town square. However, a new urban planning scheme of 1864 reduced the area available for construction, and the community decided to buy another parcel of in Maria Valeria Street, approximately south of the original location. =Design and construction= Franjo Klein, a Vienna-born Zagreb architect, was commissioned to build the synagogue. Klein, a representative of romantic historicism, modeled the building on the Viennese Leopoldst√§dter Tempel (1858), a Moorish Revival temple designed by Ludwig F√∂rster. It became a prototype for synagogue design in Central Europe. Zagreb Synagogue used the already developed round arch style (Rundbogenstil), but did not adopt F√∂rster's early oriental motifs. Computer reconstruction of the cross section of the Zagreb Synagogue. Synagogue's interior was photographed in 1880 by Ivan Standl. The composition of the main facade, with its dominant drawn-out and elevated projection and the two symmetrical lower lateral parts, reflects the internal division into three naves. At ground-floor level, the front was distinguished by the three-arch entrance and bifora, whereas the first-floor level had a high triforium with an elevated arch and the quadrifoliate rosettes on the staircases. The synagogue occupied the greater part of the plot, facing west. It receded from the street regulation-line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in Austria‚ÄìHungary, prohibiting non-Catholic places of worship from having a public entrance from the street. The synagogue had a wider and slightly higher central nave and two narrower naves; unlike F√∂rster's synagogue in Vienna, it did not have a basilical plan. Construction began in 1866 and was completed the following year. The synagogue was officially consecrated on September 27, 1867, a ceremony attended by representatives of city and regional authorities, Zagreb public figures, and many citizens. It was the first prominent public building in Zagreb's lower town, and its architecture and scale aroused general admiration and praise. =19th and early 20th century= Model of the Zagreb Synagogue on display at the Zagreb City Museum. One of the surviving memorial tables, on display at the Zagreb City Museum, marked the occasion of reconsecration after the 1881 repair. With the new synagogue, an organ was introduced into religious service. The small minority of Orthodox Jews found this change to be intolerable, and they began to hold their services separately, in rented rooms. In the 1880 earthquake, the synagogue suffered minor damage and was repaired the following year. Largely due to immigration from Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, the Jewish population of Zagreb quickly grew in size: from 1,285 members in 1887 to 3,237 members in 1900, and then to 5,970 members in 1921. The synagogue became too small to accommodate the needs of the ever-growing community. In 1921 a renovation was undertaken to increase the number of available seats. A 1931 plan to increase the capacity to 944 seats was ultimately abandoned. A central heating system was installed in 1933. =Demolition during World War II= During the 1941 collapse of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Usta≈°a regime. The Usta≈°a quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews were subjected to mass arrests and deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad. Demolition in 1941 In October 1941, the newly installed mayor of Zagreb, Ivan Werner, issued a decree ordering the demolition of the Pra≈°ka Street synagogue, ostensibly because it did not fit into the city's master plan. The demolition began on October 10, 1941, proceeding slowly so as not to damage the adjacent buildings; it was finished by April 1942. The whole process was photographed for propaganda purposes, and the photographs were shown to the public at an antisemitic exhibition first held in Zagreb. It was also shown in Dubrovnik, Karlovac, Sarajevo, Vukovar and Zemun, as an illustration of the \\"solution of the Jewish question in Croatia\\". A fragment of the film footage of the demolition was discovered five decades later by the film director Lordan Zafranoviƒá during research for his 1993 documentary feature, Decline of the Century: Testimony of L. Z.; 41 seconds of the film survives. This footage was also shown in Mira Wolf's documentary, The Zagreb Synagogue 1867-1942 (1996), produced by Croatian Radiotelevision. wash-basin was salvaged from the rubble after the end of World War II. The synagogue's eight valuable Torah scrolls were saved due to an intervention by Leonardo Griviƒçiƒá, an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from Mile Budak, a minister in the Usta≈°a government. He was also close to Poglavnik Ante Paveliƒá and the Third Reich's ambassador to Croatia, Edmund Glaise- Horstenau. Although Griviƒçiƒá did not have a significant political role in the Independent State of Croatia, he was considered trustworthy. On October 9, 1941, he learned about the regime's plan to start the demolition of the synagogue on the following morning. By that evening, Griviƒçiƒá secretly relayed the information to the synagogue's chief cantor, Gr√ºner, and during the night, the Torah scrolls were moved to safety. Shortly after the destruction of the synagogue, the Catholic archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac delivered a homily in which he said: \\"A house of God of any faith is a holy thing, and whoever harms it will pay with their lives. In this world and the next they will be punished.\\". The only surviving fragments of the building ‚Äî the wash- basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt, as well as some parts of a column ‚Äî were saved by Ivo Kraus. He pulled them from the rubble shortly after the end of World War II. The wash-basin and the memorial tables are now in the Zagreb City Museum. The column fragments are kept by the Jewish Community of Zagreb. Reconstruction efforts memorial plaque in Hebrew and Croatian at 7 Pra≈°ka Street, unveiled in 1986, marks the site of the former synagogue. =1945‚Äì1990= Only one in five Croatian Jews survived the Holocaust of World War II. Between 1948 and 1952, nearly one half of the surviving members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to Israel, and the community dropped to one-tenth of its pre-war membership. The Yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, including the plot in Pra≈°ka Street. All this, combined with the new regime's general hostility toward religion, made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible. After World War II, the vacant site of the former synagogue was used as a makeshift volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day. After 1986, the Jewish Community of Zagreb began to consider a Jewish cultural center and a memorial synagogue. Two architects, Branko Silaƒëin and Boris Morsan, both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition, came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new Jewish center in Pra≈°ka Street. Silaƒëin's vision was ultimately not accepted by the Jewish community; instead, plans were being made for the construction of the cultural center and a synagogue, following an international architecture competition. However, despite support for the project both within Yugoslavia and abroad, the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government. The project was not developed. =1990‚Äìpresent= A parking lot in Pra≈°ka Street, where the synagogue was located. By the autumn of 1990, after the first democratic elections in Croatia, the municipal government finally approved the project. An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. Political turmoil in the country, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian War of Independence (1991‚Äì1995), caused the project to be put on hold again. In 1994 President of Croatia Franjo Tuƒëman said to Jakov Bienenfeld, Council member of the Zagreb Jewish community, that they should build the new synagogue at the site of the former synagogue, which will be funded by the Croatian government. Bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when a great number of churches are left destroyed at the time, during Croatian War of Independence. In the meantime, the Jewish Community of Zagreb sought to legally reacquire its property. The Croatian denationalization law was enacted in 1996, and the Pra≈°ka Street parcel was finally returned to the community on December 31, 1999. By 2000, reconstruction activities were invigorated again. An investment study was submitted to the Government of Croatia and the City of Zagreb in July 2004 and revised in October 2004. The architecture competition was planned for 2005. However, a 2005 rift in the Jewish Community of Zagreb resulted in formation of a splinter Jewish community, Bet Israel, led by Ivo and Slavko Goldstein. In September 2006, the Government of Croatia formed a construction workgroup. It was decided that the project, estimated at the time at HRK 173 million (US$ 30 million), would be partially financed by the Government of Croatia and the City of Zagreb, and that both Jewish organizations should be represented in the workgroup. However, the involvement of Bet Israel was deemed unacceptable by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, which is the sole owner of the Pra≈°ka Street property, and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the Zagreb Jewish community. As a consequence, the community and its president, Ognjen Kraus, refused further participation in the project under the set conditions. Further disagreements existed about the design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building a replica of the original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines. In 2014 and 2015, the Jewish Community of Zagreb presented new plans for a multi-purpose Jewish center and synagogue in Pra≈°ka Street.

Biography J√∏rgine was born into a poor family supported by the tenant farm of Utafor, under the farm of Galde nordre in B√∏verdalen, a valley in Lom municipality in the county of Oppland, in the Gudbrandsdalen region of Norway. In 1903, she and her older sister Mari emigrated to the United States. Their journey was long and arduous as they often were at the time: They first walked 20 km to the center of Fossbergom, then on the back of a horse-drawn cart to Otta, and from there the train to Kristiania. From there they traveled by boat to Bergen, boarded a liner to Hull, England, and from there by train to Liverpool. In Liverpool, they stayed in a boarding house with twenty other women. They left for the New World on the ocean liner RMS Cedric, and arrived, with 2,800 other passengers, in New York City ten days later on June 14, 1903. Once landed in New York, they traveled by train to Minneapolis via Chicago, and finally arrived in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, where they were met by their uncle Ole. They were immediately put to work, possibly to repay the debt of their passage. J√∏rgine worked at her uncle's farm, but also as a nanny at a neighboring farm, while attending several evening courses. In 1905, J√∏rgine was admitted as a student nurse at the Minnesota Mental Institution in Minneapolis. She was subsequently admitted to the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. In 1915 she married Richard Sloane, who was on the faculty of Columbia as a surgeon. She also made her first return trip to Norway. She was widowed after six months. By this point, however, Georgia (as she was now known) had been introduced to society in New York. In 1917 she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Lucius M. Boomer The Jorgine Boomer House The house, located at 5808 30th Street in Phoenix, Az., was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 2016, reference #16000071. In 1920, she married Lucius M. Boomer (1878-1947), president of Boomer-du Pont Properties Corporation. Lucius M. Boomer owned or managed a number of hotels with industrialist Thomas Coleman DuPont. In 1918, they purchased the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel, then in 1920 the Willard Hotel in Washington, D. C. and in 1925 the company purchased The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia from the heirs of the founder, George C. Boldt. Later Boomer had charge of the Claridge restaurant of Times Square and the Windsor Hotel, in Montreal. Eventually he became directing head of Louis Sherry Inc., the president of the Sherry- Netherland Hotel and also president of the Savarin Restaurant chain. Boomer Takes Command (The Story Of The Waldorf-Astoria) Georgia and her husband managed The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel during its most celebrated era. The original Waldorf-Astoria was torn down in 1929 to make room for the Empire State Building. Lucius Boomer had retained exclusive rights to use the name Waldorf- Astoria. Boomer was in retirement in late 1929 when he was asked if he would head up a new Waldorf-Astoria. On October 1, 1931, the new Waldorf-Astoria was opened to the public. On June 26, 1947, Lucius Boomer died at 67 years of age while vacationing in Hamar, Norway. On October 12, 1949, the Waldorf became a Hilton Hotel. Although The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel passed to Conrad Hilton, Georgia continued to manage the hotel for several years afterwards.. Some sources indicate that he died in a plane accident, but both TIME and The New York Times agree he died of a \\"heart ailment\\" while staying at the Astoria Hotel in transit to Gudbrandsdalen. Lucius and Georgia had befriended many of the celebrities of their time. Among them were presidents Herbert Hoover, Harry S Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower; performers such as Charlie Chaplin, Benny Goodman, Douglas Fairbanks, and Kirsten Flagstad; explorers Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof Nansen, Trygve Lie as well as members of the Norwegian royal family. She helped a young Frank Sinatra launch his career by allowing him to perform there, and is (in competition with several others) credited for popularizing the Waldorf Salad.. This claim is dubious; most sources credit Oscar Tshirky, the maitre d' for having coming up with the recipe in 1896 Legacy Georgia Boomer purchased several properties in Norway, and after her death the urn with her ashes were deposited at one of her farms. Her name is also remembered in connection with the house on North 30th Street in Phoenix, Arizona designed for her in 1953 by Frank Lloyd Wright, commonly referred to as the J√∏rgine Boomer Residence.

O'Regan (born 1952) is an Irish Catholic intellectual and the Catherine F. Huisking Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame. O'Regan studied at University College Dublin gaining a BA and MA. He studied at Yale University earning an MA, MLitt and PhD.Prof. Cyril O'Regan After the Cataclysm, Interdisciplinary Symposium at Duke University. He specialises in systematic theology and historical theology, with a specific interest in continental philosophy, religious literature, mystical theology and post- modern thought. He is best known for his multi-volume gnosticism series. This series began with Gnostic Return in Modernity and continued in Gnostic Apocalypse: Jacob Boehme's Haunted Narrative. Rehabilitating a project attempted in the nineteenth century by a leader of the T√ºbingen school of theology, Ferdinand Christian Baur, O'Regan attempts to identify a gnostic structure or \\"grammar\\" that can be traced through sources and authors as diverse as Valentinianism and William Blake. By identifying this grammar, he hoped to find a way to distinguish works of gnosticism from other types with superficial resemblances, such as writings in Neoplatonism. As a Christian theologian, he also hopes to equip theologians to avoid gnosticism, which he sees as an alternative contrary to genuine Christian faith yet, by its nature, one that is present in every era. This project is in some ways similar to that of Eric Voegelin, who in his Science, Politics and Gnosticism (1968) attempted to identify some core features of gnosticism that he viewed as dangerous, though the two thinkers disagree about how to define gnosticism and why it should be rejected.Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews May 1, 2001 Upon the completion of the von Balthasar series with the second Anatomy of Misremembering volume, O'Regan will focus his attention on two further volumes in his gnosticism series. The next volume, the third in the series, will focus on German Idealism (chiefly, G. W. F. Hegel, F. W. J. Schelling, and Johann Gottlieb Fichte), with a later, fourth volume covering German and English Romanticism (chiefly, William Blake, Johann Christian Friedrich H√∂lderlin and Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg (Novalis). In advocating for new ways of recognizing gnosticism, O'Regan draws on categories such as metalepsis that he developed in his earlier work, The Heterodox Hegel. O'Regan has also written widely in monographs and reviews on the concept of the apocalyptic.http://itself.wordpress.com/author/jeesunautre/  Notes  Bibliography  * O'Regan, Cyril, 1994, The Heterodox Hegel.

He played in the top-flight DDR-Oberliga for BSG Turbine Erfurt and SC Lokomotive Leipzig. After his playing career Konzack worked as manager. Konzack began to play football after the end of World War II, joining Sportgemeinschaft Annah√ºtte as a 15-year-old. Aged 20 he took up studying for a sports diploma at the newly established Deutsche Hochschule f√ºr K√∂rperkultur (DHfK) in Leipzig and belonged to the first graduates in 1953. In his time in Leipzig Konzack had played for BSG Chemie Leipzig, making his way into the Oberliga squad in 1951 and appearing in 25 Oberliga matches until 1953. At the start of the 1953-54 season he transferred to Turbine Erfurt, winning the championship in his first year there. He played in 23 matches as a forward and was significantly involved in Erfurt's title win. Erfurt defended their title in the next season, but Konzack played a mere 6 matches this time. In 1955 he returned to Leipzig, joining the successor of his former club, SC Lokomotive Leipzig. Until 1960 he played in 132 Oberliga matches for the club. On 22 December 1957 he won the FDGB-Pokal, Leipzig beating SC Empor Rostock 2‚Äì1. In the next year, Konzack was subbed in for the last eight minutes of extra time in the cup final, but his team lost 1‚Äì2 to SC Einheit Dresden. At the end of the 1960 season Konzack ended his Oberliga career, joining third-tier BSG Chemie Riesa as a player- manager. When the team was relegated to the Bezirksliga Dresden in 1963, he once again returned to Leipzig and took over managing the reserve team of newly formed SC Leipzig. In the 1965-66 season he managed the Oberliga team of the club, but as he could not lead them to the expected top position, he had to take over second-tier BSG Motor Steinach in the summer of 1966. After finishing 6th and 4th in the DDR-Liga, Konzack took over BSG Lok Stendal, just relegated from the Oberliga, for the 1968-69 season. In his first season in Stendal, he closely missed out on promotion, finishing second in the league. After the first half of the following season Stendal was well up in the field with 20:6 points, but Konzack was sacked nevertheless and had to take over the role of a scientific advisor with BSG Lok. In the summer of 1970 he joined Oberliga side 1. FC Magdeburg as assistant manager of Heinz Kr√ºgel. In his first season with Magdeburg, Konzack served as a stand-in manager, as Heinz Kr√ºgel was studying at the DHfK.

In September 2018 he assisted in the founding the Irish Freedom Party, and is now president of the party. Early life and education Kelly was born in 1968 and is originally from the Bogside in Derry. His father was a headmaster of a school in Creggan, his mother was a nurse and he has three siblings. He studied marine biology in Edinburgh before studying theology as a lay student at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth. He briefly worked as a teacher in Dublin. WriterJournalism= As a journalist, Kelly was a contributing columnist to the Irish Examiner, and also wrote for the Irish Mail on Sunday. He also wrote for the The Sunday Times, Sunday Independent, Sunday Mirror, The Sunday Business Post and Magill magazine. Following the resignation of editor Simon Rowe in mid-2004, Kelly was briefly acting editor (and later deputy editor) of The Irish Catholic . =Kathy O'Beirne book= In 2007, Kelly wrote a book titled Kathy's Real Story which disputed the claims made in a book by Kathy O'Beirne (Don't Ever Tell), in which O'Beirne described childhood abuse she had reputedly suffered in a Magdalene Asylum. Kelly claimed that initial doubts that he had while reading her book were confirmed by inconsistencies in different accounts which O'Beirne had given, and later confirmed by various witnesses and documentary evidence. He also claimed that false allegations were being made by those appearing before the Residential Institutions Redress Board in order to receive compensation. A review by Gene Kerrigan (who worked alongside Michael Sheridan, O'Beirne's co- author) criticised Kelly's own criticism of O'Beirne's book. Kelly and O'Beirne both appeared on Ireland AM to discuss their books in November 2007, and the encounter ended in an argument. Kelly also wrote to the proposed publishers of a sequel by O'Beirne, sending them a copy of Kathy's Real Story and asking them not to publish. A Sunday Times article of July 2009 indicated that the publisher had withdrawn their initial offer to publish her book because of an \\"unresolved legal issue\\". European Union politics Kelly was formerly a press officer for Nigel Farage, and the director of communications for Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), of which Farage was co- president. The EFDD dissolved in mid-2019. Kelly, who is from Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, supports the Republic of Ireland leaving the European Union (an 'Irexit'), and is the President of the Irish Freedom Party, a party that advocates the same position. He contested the 2019 European Parliament election in the Dublin constituency, receiving 2,441 (0.67%) first preference votes and was eliminated on the fourth count. Political views Kelly advocates for Ireland to leave the European Union and for a united Ireland. In a 2019 interview, he said: \\"It's not just about leaving the EU, it's about more basic things. It's about freedom of speech, something that's under attack in Ireland, it‚Äôs about encouraging work, encouraging families and encouraging people to have children\\". Kelly is fiscally conservative, and has questioned the financial cost of Ireland's EU contributions. His party, the Irish Freedom Party, is anti-abortion, pro-natalist and \\"supportive of stable families for procreation\\". Kelly has described his views as representing \\"Irish Catholic nationalism\\". Some outlets have linked Kelly with alt-right ideologies, pointing to a video which Kelly recorded with far-right British Loyalist and former British National Party member Jim Dowson. In the video Kelly stated that \\"[they want to] kill Irish kids and [..] replace them with every nationality who wants to come into our country\\", a statement which several news outlets associated with the white nationalist \\"great replacement\\" conspiracy theory. This followed a similar interview, in January 2019 with LifeSiteNews, in which Kelly denounced what he called the \\"great replacement of our children\\". In a 2019 Twitter post, Kelly stated that \\"those talking about a Great Replacement in Ireland have a point\\". Later in 2019, Kelly stated that, before an Irish government could make policy changes which result in \\"population increases [..] immigration or otherwise, it must first consult the people of Ireland\\". In interviews and Twitter posts, Kelly has stated that he does not support the idea of separate races or racial superiority, while also advocating for a \\"mono cultural society\\". Kelly has spoken in favour of free speech, and called for an end to the controls in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland.

It caters for scholars aged 11 to 18. It is also home to the Suffolk Centre of Excellence in Mathematics. The school was named after the Lowestoft-born composer Benjamin Britten and was designed as he approached his death in 1974. Its modernist design reflected the style of his compositions and remains distinctive in its layout and intended black and white colour scheme. The school was completed in 1979.Services, English Heritage, retrieved 29 July 2016 In September 2011 the school became an 11 to 16 school as part of the reorganisation of schools in Lowestoft by Suffolk County Council. Pupils in years 7 and 8 joined the school after the closure of eight middle schools in Lowestoft. The opening of Lowestoft Sixth Form College also meant that the school lost its role in the Lowestoft 6th consortium, which had operated as a shared sixth form between the high schools in the town. Previously a Local Authority school administered by Suffolk County Council, in May 2016, the Benjamin Britten High School was converted to academy status.

Its headquarters are in South Shore, Chicago, Illinois.\\"National Office .\\" National Black United Front. Retrieved on September 28, 2011. \\"1809 East 71st, Suite 211 Chicago, Illinois 60649\\" It has been described as Christian, Left-leaning, somewhat Black nationalist and working in the tradition of the Million Man March and Malcolm X. The organization held its 30th annual convention from July 16 to July 19, 2009 in Chicago, Illinois.  Philosophy and Mission Statement  The National Black United Front (NBUF) was officially founded in 1980 in Brooklyn, New York after being hindered by assassinations and FBI counterintelligence work of the 1970s. A politically radical, grass-roots organization supporting the Pan- African movement championed by Marcus Garvey, the NBUF focuses on the advancement of all people of African descent. They have been described as ‚Äúcomfortable and adamant in defining a racial history and racial solidarity,‚Äù and they focus on controversial issues and pressing inequalities. These issues include demanding reparations for ancestors of slaves, disaster relief, prison reform, advocating Afrikan-centered education, get out the vote campaigns, and a petition to the United Nations that the United States has and continues to commit genocide against African Americans.Worrill, Conrad W. \\"Support National Black United Front Campaign Against Genocide.\\" Philadelphia Tribune, Sep 05 1997, p. 6. ProQuest. Web. 11 Dec. 2018 These principles are especially inherent in their mission statement: \\"The National Black United Front (NBUF) is an organization that believes the black people in America need to become organized and work as one in order to become free, liberated and independent. They urge black citizens across the nation to join their organization because it is an organization that is working in the best interests of our people. The black community has immense culture and history that extends back long before we can even remember. Even though much of our past is filled with hardship and can be termed ‚Äúcritical‚Äù our status as black people in America is not irreversible. Our long history of struggling in this country has brought about our many victories against racism, political oppression, economic oppression, and cultural domination. The mission of The National Black United Front is to continue on with the fight for equality. They believe in this day and age there is a need for bold radical actions and strong commitment to be organized for Black Power.\\" These ideals are also outlined in their 2018 Principles of Unity, which are:  Community Involvement and Other Activities  As made apparent by the Houston Chapter's blog posts, the organization's ideals and philosophies are upheld through significant community involvement. They have aided in criminal justice cases, including the release of exonerated death-row inmate Clarence Brandley and involvement in the Shaka Sankofa (Gary Graham) case, hold Sankofa Study Circles to teach black history, host various black artists through the Black Arts Movement, participate in the Feed the Hood Project, and are involved in the Haitian outreach program (Haitian Ministries formed by one of NBUF'S past National Secretaries and member of the Houston chapter). The NBUF also sponsors cultural programs, including the Frontlines Album Project, sponsorship of annual Kwanzaa Programs, and African Liberation Day activities. Internationally, the NBUF was involved with the Free South Africa Movement, supported Prime Minister Maurice Bishop of Grenada, and donated to victims of the mass slaughter in Rwanda. The National Black United Front Human Rights and Genocide Campaign is a Petition/Declaration to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. The Petition/Declaration of more than 200,000 signatures of African people who agree that the U.S. government has committed and continues to commit genocide against the African population in the United States has been a major focus of the Campaign. In the submission of the Petition/Declaration, they also submitted preliminary information in a 38 count indictment against the United States for a variety of Human Rights violations against African people in the country. The NBUF also recently become a certified organization with the National Black Federation of Charities, an arm of the National Black United Fund, Inc. and are now able to receive donations through payroll deduction from people in the federal workplace throughout the world.  Controversy  Some controversy has surrounded the NBUF during its existence. Early in its formation, female activists involved with the organization, including Loretta Ross, Nkenge Tour√©, and Jamala Rogers, felt resistance in the form of sexism from other leaders within the organization. There was a difficult struggle to form a women's section, and the most blatant manifestation of sexism came in the resistance to sending a delegation from the NBUF to the 1985 Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. Those against sending a delegation argued the women were ‚Äúabandoning the black struggle and blindly following the white feminist movement,‚Äù going so far as to boo the women at the NBUF conference that year. The NBUF sisters did end up attending the conference and made a significant contribution by networking with African women from all over the world and presenting a paper on ‚ÄúThe Presence of African Women in America.‚Äù Jamala Rogers offered another example of sexism, stating that when the St. Louis branch of a different organization, the Organization for Black Struggle, merged with the NBUF St. Louis chapter, they eventually broke off from the NBUF due to issues of patriarchy and sectarianism. More recently, NBUF leader Dr. Charles Worrill has been criticized for his extreme political militancy and for continuing to support and work with the controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who is also known for extreme anti-Semitic remarks.

Early life Abramowitz graduated with a B.A. with high honors in political science from the University of Rochester in 1969. He attended graduate school at Stanford University, completing an M.A. in 1972 and a Ph.D. in 1976. Abramowitz' dissertation was entitled An Assessment of Party and Incumbent Accountability in Midterm Congressional Elections. Career Abramowitz taught at the College of William and Mary from 1976 to 1982 and at Stony Brook University from 1982 to 1987. He then joined the faculty at Emory University as a professor of political science. Abramowitz was awarded the Alben W. Barkley Distinguished Chair in Political Science at Emory University in 1993. Abramowitz has authored or co-authored five books. His 1992 book co-authored with Jeff Segal of Stony Brook University, Senate Elections, written in 1992, received two awards from political science associations and remains one of the seminal works in the study of senatorial elections to this day. Abramowitz has written extensively on many disparate topics in American politics, including presidential, Senate and House of Representatives elections, activism, polarization, ideology, partisanship, ideological realignment, incumbency, and redistricting. =Time- for-change model= In 1988, Abramowitz devised a model, which he termed the \\"time-for-change model\\", for predicting the outcome of the popular vote in United States presidential elections.\\"Alan Abramowitz‚Äôs Model Has Correctly Predicted Every Presidential Election Outcome Since 1992\\". Longreads Blog. April 5, 2015. The model makes its prediction based on only three inputs: \\"the growth rate of the economy during the second quarter of the election year, the incumbent president‚Äôs approval rating at mid-year, and the length of time the incumbent president‚Äôs party has controlled the White House\\". The last of these is what Abramowitz dubbed \\"the time-for-change factor\\", arguing that the longer a political party controls the presidency, the more likely the other party will be to win it back, since \\"voters attach a positive value to periodic alternation in power by the two major parties\\". Pdf. Abramowitz's model was correct in every presidential election from 1988 until 2016, when it predicted that Donald Trump would win the popular vote; he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, although he did win the Electoral College. In May 2016, Abramowitz had predicted that Clinton would win the popular vote by an even larger margin, stating that his model assumed that both political parties would nominate mainstream candidates and that Trump broke this assumption.

It became the first literary coffeehouse in Paris. For over 200 years the cafe-restaurant attracted notables in the world of arts, politics, and literature.  Biography  Founded Caf√© Procope in Paris in 1686. Some sources say Cut√≤ was born near Mount Etna in Sicily around the town of Aci Trezza.THE CAFE PROCOPE by Addison May Rothrock; Lippincott's Monthly Magazine (1886-1915); Jun 1906; 77, 462; American Periodicals Series Online, pg. 702 Other sources say he was born at or near Palermo. A certificate of baptism of 10 February 1651 has been found in the archives of the parish church of Sant'Ippolito in Palermo one day after his birth that shows his first name as Francesco and his surname as Cut√≤, a common surname in Sicily. A third possibility is that he was born near Palermo and lived in Aci Trezza for a period of time. The name Procopio was adopted from the historian Procopius, whose Secret History, the Anekdota, long known of, had been discovered in the Vatican Library and published for the first time ever in 1623: it told the scandals of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, the empress-consort Theodora, and his court.Whether or not the Procopio was an addition to his name, his son, naturalised as Michel Procope-Couteau (1684‚Äì1753), was a doctor of medicine, a Freemason by 1727, a writer, wit and bon vivant who became a librarian at the Faculty of Medicine late in life. (Gordon R. Silber, \\"In Search of Helvetius' Early Career as a Freemason\\" Eighteenth-Century Studies 15.4 (Summer 1982, pp. 421‚Äì441) pp 432ff. Cut√≤ received the surname dei Coltelli from the French, who mistook his Sicilian family name, as it is a homophone of French couteaux \\"knives\\". Coltelli means \\"knives\\" in Italian. Hence, translating back into Italian gives Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, the other name he is known by. \\"Francesco Procopio\\" are his forenames; Francesco was his grandfather's name. Cut√≤ married Marguerite Crou√Øn on 26 February 1675 in the Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris.David, p. 19. The marriage record shows the witnesses as his father Onofrio Cut√≤ and his mother Domenica Semarqua. Procopio and Marguerite had eight children during their long marriage before Procopio became a widower in 1696.Marcello Messina, \\"The caf√© Le Procope\\" in Scirocco, Year 3, Nov. / Dec. 2003, pp. 19-21David, p. 28. = Early life = Cut√≤ played in the snow when he was a boy. The snow was mixed with fruit juices and honey to make a type of sorbet. This type of \\"ice cream\\" was eaten by both rich aristocrats and by peasants. This is where Procopio got the idea of developing gelato. Procopio is credited with being the inventor of modern gelato. Cut√≤ worked first as a fisherman like his father Onofrio. His grandfather Francesco was also a fisherman from Aci Trezza who built gelatiere machines (ice cream makers) part-time, when he was not fishing. Francesco eventually left his invention to his grandson as an inheritance. Cut√≤ tinkered with his grandfather's \\"ice cream\\" machine making various improvements and eventually felt that he had developed a machine that would produce gelato on a large scale and decided to promote the new product. He left Sicily and went to France by way of Italy. = Caf√© Procope = Cut√≤ acquired the skills to become a cook, possibly in Palermo on his way to France, arriving in Paris sometime between 1670 and 1674. There he joined the guild of the ' () and apprenticed under the leadership of an Armenian immigrant named Pascal who had a kiosk (', ) on rue de Tournon selling refreshments, including lemonade and coffee.Fitch, p. 43 Pascal's attempt at such a business in Paris was not successful and he went to London in 1675, leaving the stall to Cut√≤.The first Paris cafe was probably Le Procope, opened about 1675 (it moved to its present location in 1686) by a Sicilian, who helped turn France into a coffee-drinking society. Literary Cafes of Paris by Noel Riley Fitch, Starrhill Press, Washington & Philadelphia Cut√≤ had learned in about 1680 how to make a beverage of ice made of lemonade using salt to lower its temperature and keep cooler longer.\\"A history of inventions and discoveries. By John Beckmann, ... Translated from German by William Johnston. ...\\" Vol.3. London, 1797. Eighteenth Century Collections Online. Gale. Library of Congress. 19 May 2009 He had a special royal license from King Louis XIV to sell a melange of refreshments including spices, iced drinks including \\"frozen waters\\", barley water, anise flower, orange flower, cinnamon flower, frangipan, and his improved version of the Italian \\"ice cream\\" of fruit-based gelatos like lemon and orange.Kopfer, p. 12 This gave him exclusive rights to these unique sweet and cool products from his kiosk booth at the Foire Saint- Germain. Prior to Cut√≤ arriving in France there had been other caf√©s (coffee houses) there, although they were called boutiques at the time. Some were referred to as lemonade stands, meaning they sold various cold drinks including lemonade. There had been a caf√© in Marseille in 1644 before Pascal and Cut√≤ that soon became defunct, and a Levantine had opened a coffee house in Paris in 1643, which had also failed. It seems, however, that Pascal was the first to call his establishment a \\"caf√©\\" or coffee house where one drinks coffee. Establishments serving coffee were in fact common in Paris at this time, although almost all of them were frequented by foreigners and the lower classes. By selling coffee at the fair, Pascal made coffee-drinking acceptable to the general public. Cut√≤ soon added coffee to his refreshments' list and the kiosk became a caf√©. He introduced the Italian \\"ice cream\\" gelato at his caf√© and is one of the first to sell this new European product directly to the public. Prior to then it was reserved for royalty only. Cut√≤'s caf√© served it in small porcelain bowls that resembled egg cups. He is sometimes referred to as \\"The Father of Italian gelato\\".Moramarco, p. 208 The father of Italian gelato is Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, a Sicilian aristocrat who established a chain of coffee houses throughout Europe in the late seventeenth century. Cut√≤ relocated his kiosk in 1686 to the rue des Foss√©s Saint- German.David, pp. 24‚Äì25. In 1689, as luck would have it, the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise opened its doors across the street from his caf√©, and it became a very popular cultural and political gathering place. Notable people who have frequented the caf√© include Maximilien Robespierre, Victor Hugo, Paul Verlaine, Honor√© de Balzac Pierre Beaumarchais, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Alain-Ren√© Lesage, Georges Danton, Jean-Paul Marat, Honor√© de Balzac and Denis Diderot. Even Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Paul Jones, Oscar Wilde, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Napoleon Bonaparte and Voltaire visited Procopio's cafe not only for coffee and intellectual conversations, but for gelato. In 1702, he changed his name to Fran√ßois Procope.David, p. 27. His caf√© in the 17th century turned France into a coffee drinking society. It is considered the most famous and successful cafe in Paris. To fans of French history Procopio's business is considered \\"the holy grail of Parisian caf√©s.\\" = Later life = Cut√≤ obtained French citizenship in 1685. He married a second time in 1696 and fathered five more children with Anne Fran√ßoise Garnier. He was married a third time at the age of 66, in 1717, to Julie Parmentier and had another son. In 1702, he changed his name to Fran√ßois Procope. His second son Alexandre took over the Caf√© Procope in 1716, but Cut√≤ continued to operate another caf√© during the annual Foire Saint-Germain.

Wallace's first competitive match was a rugby league one, playing for Greenburg Street in the Wigan Amateur league, where he remained for four years before switching codes to the round ball. He signed for Everton Youths, where his teammates included Cliff Marshall, the Toffees' first ever black player, and Dave Jones (footballer born 1956). He also recalled Bob Latchford as the star at the club, an England international who was a prolific goalscorer. Syd was himself not shy in front of goal, but in season 1973/74, after making 22 appearances and scoring 21 times, he had the misfortune to break his leg against Blackpool.

Johnson (1884‚Äì1978) was a notable businessman and philanthropist in San Francisco, California. He was one of the founders of the American Forest Products Corporation, a Fortune 500 company in the 1950s and 1960s, and of Friden, Inc., the Friden Calculating Machine Company, which developed and sold electro-mechanical numerators and office equipment, predecessors of today's computerized counterparts. As a philanthropist, Walter S. Johnson is most famous for his 1959 contribution to the preservation of the Palace of Fine Arts, an act that ensured the endurance of the iconic San Francisco landmark. Early life Walter S. Johnson was born in East Saginaw, Michigan in 1884. His father Alfred Johnson was a musician who wanted to move west and buy a farm. His mother Mary Augusta Calkins (sometimes spelled Caulkins), an educated daughter of a journalist, had no interest in a farming life. Despite her wishes, the family moved to California and eventually settled on a small farm in Tulare. Mary became deeply unhappy and moved to San Francisco to pursue a newspaper career, leaving Walter and his four siblings in the temporary care of their father. Mary was hired by The San Francisco Call newspaper and was a regular contributor, reviewing books and interviewing authors and celebrities (The Call later became The San Francisco Call-Bulletin and eventually The San Francisco Examiner.) In the late 1890s, she had the good fortune to work with Fremont Older, the charismatic editor of The Call Bulletin. Older was remarkably unbiased toward women in the newspaper field, believing \\"whoever could best do the story got the job\\".Wells, Evelyn, Fremont Older, page 219, D. Appleton-Century Company, Inc., 1936 Mary not only interviewed such names as Jack London, Gertrude Atherton, and Sarah Bernhart, but also got the daring \\"scoop\\" on the subjects of renowned trials and events including murderers and pugilists. Eventually, Mary and Alfred officially divorced. The three young daughters, Ruth, Cornelia and Harriet, went to live with their mother, who later remarried, while the boys, Walter and Alfred, Jr., stayed with their father. Greatly disheartened by his wife's departure and the divorce that followed, Alfred sold his farm, packed his two sons and all his belongings and headed out to sell musical instruments. The three intrepid travelers journeyed in a covered horse-drawn carriage through California to Oregon, back again and down to Arizona, where they eventually settled. In the crevice of time in the late 19th century before the total proliferation of the railways, roads and telegraph and before the population grew and native culture diminished, Walter was able to experience a final frontier. He and his father and brother fished, shot game, battled bears, braved rivers and weather, encountered Native Americans and collected a lifetime of memories. Walter's formal education began in Safford, Arizona at the Latter-day Saint Gila Academy (the predecessor of the Eastern Arizona College) a Mormon school where he studied sales, bookkeeping and business law (one of only a few non-Mormons, Walter was given the good-natured moniker \\"Gentile\\" by his schoolmates). At the age of 17, Walter went to live with his mother and sisters in San Francisco. After working a number of odd jobs, Walter landed a job as a circulation manager at The Bulletin newspaper. Earthquake \\"At 5:13 AM on April 18, 1906, I was awakened by a roaring noise. The house and earth shook, power poles and trees shuddered and waved in the air as if being blown by a strong wind... .T.E.D. Friend, Country Boys Make Good, page 65, Poor Richard's Press, 1969\\" Johnson was 21 when the 1906 earthquake struck SF. The wood and brick house he lived in at 929 Jackson Street shook and trembled, later to burn to the ground. His quick-witted mother and brother-in-law directed the clan to the Ferry Building, one grouping making the only ferry trip to Sausalito, another making the trip in a rowboat. Johnson and a friend, Tom Truxell, were able to salvage some of the family belongings and keep them from looters by burying valuables in the yard and taking a second load to the Presidio. Once at the Presidio, both young men were immediately assigned jobs protecting and accounting food items warehoused at the site. These were to be distributed by the army to the refugees encamped in Golden Gate Park and similar areas around the city. Johnson worked for a month aiding the relief effort. He drove out of the city to procure milk, drove wagons full of hospital mattresses and supplies from the Letterman General Hospital to the refugees, and, as every pedestrian in the city was required, helped clear streets. Two of the best earthquake stories come from Walter Johnson's half brother, Henry Brooke: > Walter, living half as a refugee and half a relief agent, had a bedroll that > he rolled a few garments in and tucked away in the bushes until needed. > Once, upon returning one night, he discovered a pair of pants were missing. > In their place were two beautiful brass candlesticks and a note that read: > \\"Very sorry, just had to have the pants!\\" An amusing ditty of the time surrounded the unscathed whiskey warehouse at the bottom of Folsom (Howard?): > If, as they say, God spanked the city because it got too frisky, Why did he > shake the churches down and save Hotelings whiskey? Shortly after the earthquake, Walter Johnson gathered the newsboys he knew from his job at the Bulletin and started selling out-of-town newspapers and magazines. His first newsstand stood in the rubble of Fillmore Street. He was soon selling papers all across the city. This endeavor blossomed into a book and stationery store on Fillmore and then on Market Street. In 1911, Johnson and his brother Alfred opened a similar store in Modesto, where their father had relocated. World War I Not satisfied with the life of a merchant, Johnson began to study for entrance into law school. He sold his share of the business to his brother and enrolled at Boalt Hall School of Law, later finishing at Hastings Law School in San Francisco. The very day Johnson became a member of the California bar, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in Serbia, setting off World War I. Johnson joined the war effort when the US became involved in 1917. He closed his small law practice and spent three months in officer's training at the Presidio. As a First Lieutenant, Johnson was sent to Aberdeen, Washington to subvert the efforts of an anti-government group, the Industrial Workers of the World, or I.W.W., who were determined to slow lumber production. Agitators used sabotage, threats and violence causing disastrous slow-downs and shut-downs that were detrimental to the war effort. Johnson used his skills as a lawyer and business manager to convince workers to remain loyal to the U.S. resulting in the eventual ousting of the seditionists. His legal and business skills were again used as the war wound down and he was transferred to New York City to settle government contracts with war-materials factories that were closing down. Johnson had made Captain by the time he left the Army. Big business After the war, Johnson returned to San Francisco and his law practice. On occasion, an old childhood friend by the name of Bert Webster would drop in. Webster was in the wood box business in Stockton with a fellow named Horace Tarter. The three became fast friends and Johnson was convinced to move his family to Stockton where he incorporated and looked after the legal matters of Tartar and Webster. The Stockton Box Company, under what became Tartar, Webster & Johnson, Inc., flourished. Johnson soon learned the ropes, selling large quantities of wooden crates to suppliers and directly to fruit growers and canneries. Soon, Tartar, Webster & Johnson, Inc. enlarged its holdings by acquiring interests in several other box and lumber companies. Johnson foresaw the need to control the raw materials that were the heart of the box business. He was also convinced that lumber would be highly valued commodity as industry and population grew. San Francisco became the center of the lumber business and Johnson operated an office at 1 Montgomery Street, in the Crocker Bank Building. Unfortunately, his friends and partners in the box company were not eager to branch out. Tartar and Webster sold out to Johnson, keeping the Stockton Box Company under their own guidance. Several years later, the three reunited as Johnson's vision began to pay off. The reunited corporation became the American Forest Products Corporation. The year was 1927 and the new corporation soon encircled a wide range of forest products. Besides the box industry, there were timber holdings, saw mills, re-manufacturing plants and complete lumber sales and distribution divisions. With good management and strong business ethics, it weathered the depression and by the end of World War II, the corporation was a multimillion-dollar operation. It was during the depression years that Johnson met Carl Friden, a Swedish-born engineer who had perfected and patented a revolutionary calculator. Friden had been very successful with his designs, but had met ruin with the stock market crash of 1929. In 1933, after Friden had spent years trying to perfect his product and find backers, he met Charles Gruenhagen, Johnson's brother-in-law. Gruenhagen was intrigued by Friden's accomplishments and introduced him to Johnson and members of the AFPC board. Friden proposed selling half interest to Johnson for $25,000, the funds to get his company off the ground. Johnson split the obligation with his partners and the Friden company began production.Founder Carl Friden (The Friden Calculating Machine Company) Johnson's investment paid off well. Friden's plant in San Leandro, California grew to consist of of facilities and employed over 500 people. During World War II, the plant was restricted to making only 25 calculators a day, while the skilled machinists and engineers were redirected to make complicated bomb fuses and tachometers. After the war, the plant continued to make delicate instruments and expanded its line of calculating products, catering to the needs of scientists, businesses and industry. Carl M. Friden died in 1945, leaving the company in turmoil. His heirs and company trustees turned to Johnson for his vision and expertise. Johnson, a highly experienced executive, was named president of the Friden Company. As he had done with the American Forest Products Corporation, Johnson turned the reasonably profitable enterprise into a multimillion-dollar outfit. Aggressive sales and progressive research and development were the mottoes for the energized Friden Company. Not content with simple success, Johnson was determined to expand the Friden Company worldwide. By the mid-1950s the organization had moved into complete office machine outfitting, producing adding machines, typesetting machines, weight scales and postage meters. Johnson had a fight on his hands trying to convince his complacent board members to move into the international market. Eventually, he won out and headed to Europe, opening offices in the Netherlands and Belgium. European sales surged and offices sprung up in Italy, England and West Germany. Johnson found himself a world traveler as he made the rounds of the Friden family of companies. Friden grew and profited, becoming well known for its punched-tape typewriters, including the iconic Flexowriter. Years later, in 1963, the company was sold to the Singer Company, which had become a billion-dollar worldwide conglomerate. Johnson and the Friden board felt Singer had the experience and the capital to keep Friden expanding. Seven years later, the American Forest Products Corporation was sold to the Bendix Corporation. Johnson had been the president of both Friden and AFPC for nearly 50 years. Personal life and legacy Walter Johnson met Mabel Brady at his stationery store in Modesto. They were married in 1914, shortly before Johnson's graduation from law school. They had three children together, Gloria, Jeneal and Walter, the latter being born in 1924. As a young couple, Mabel and Walter Johnson had the good fortune to be living in San Francisco as the Panama- Pacific Exposition was being planned and built. The expo was to be a grand celebration of the opening of the new Panama Canal, but would also let the world know that San Francisco had risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the 1906 earthquake and fire. Strewn over what had been a marshy shore, some thirty palaces of science, art and culture, statehood, and industry sprung into existence only a few years after the first shovel was turned. Fountains, towers, gardens and esplanades were to greet guests from around the world. In February 1915, the fair opened to a crowd of 255,149http://www.lovethepalace.org/facts.html and welcomed such notables as Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Edison and Charlie Chaplin, and even the Philadelphia Liberty Bell. Considered by many the most romantic feature of the fair, the Palace of Fine Arts was the favorite spot of the newlyweds. Designed by Bernard Maybeck, the building was surrounded by a handsome lagoon and illuminated beautifully. Walter and Mabel Johnson were not the only admirers. The people of San Francisco were so enamored with the palace that it was the only building to remain in place after the demolition of the expo. Unfortunately, the structure had not been constructed to last. For many years after the fair, the crumbling building continued to be a San Francisco point of interest and pride, drawing visitors from all over the world. But, by 1959, the landmark was in jeopardy. California Representative Caspar Weinberger sponsored a state assembly bill offering $2 million in restoration funds if the city of San Francisco would match it. The city faltered and Johnson stepped up to the plate, donating the needed $2 million to the project. The state funds kicked in and work on the palace began. Johnson continued to contribute to the palace for the rest of his life. In tribute, the city named the surrounding grounds the Walter S. Johnson Park.http://www.sfnpc.org/palaceoffineartshistory The palace was not the first historic building that interested Johnson. The Augustin Bernal Adobe house in Pleasanton, California and the surrounding ranch land were purchased by Johnson in 1940. Many elements of the old adobe were carefully restored and Johnson enjoyed living on the ranch for many years. Historical preservation was not Johnson's only passion. Throughout his life, he served on the boards of many charitable organizations and contributed to numerous worthy causes. One such cause was a children's home established by his childhood friend, Ettie Lee. In 1950 Ms. Lee started Ettie Lee Homes. Today, her mission is fulfilled through Ettie Lee Youth & Family Services‚ÄîSaving Lives, Changing Lives, Building Hope (www.ettielee.org). He was touched by the plight of disadvantaged youth and began a foundation to serve the needs of youth in Northern California. Today, the Walter S. Johnson Foundationhttp://www.wsjf.org continues his legacy, funding education, leadership and economic development programs for youth and families. ReferencesExternal links * The Walter S.

The parish is part of the benefice of Coxley with Godney, Henton and Wookey within the Shepton Mallet deanery. Monuments In the tower, behind the organ, there is a monument to Sir Jacob Wolff, 1st Baronet who was also a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire. He and his wife resided in Mellifont Abbey (now a care home) next to the church.

It is located directly to the north of York Minster. History Francis Drake, on display at the Treasurer's House The first Treasurer for York Minster was appointed in 1091 when the office was established by Archbishop of York Thomas of Bayeux, but all that remains of his original house is an external wall which forms part of Grays Court and sections of 12th-century masonry in the present Treasurer‚Äôs House for which it is uncertain whether they are in-situ or have been reused. As the controller of the finances of the Minster the Treasurer required a grand residence to be able to entertain important guests. The residence served in this capacity until 1547, when the Reformation of the English Church brought the job of Treasurer to an end. The last Treasurer surrendered the house to the crown on 26 May and it was granted to Protector Somerset by whom it was sold to Archbishop Robert Holgate. Thomas Young, Archbishop between 1561 and 1568, and his descendants are responsible for the structure of house as it is today. In the early 17th century the Young family added the symmetrical front and almost entirely rebuilt the house. In 1617, the Treasurer‚Äôs House played host to royalty when Sir George Young entertained King James I. The house then passed through a number of private owners including Lord Fairfax and over time was sub-divided into separate tenements. The house was restored to its present state by Frank Green, a wealthy local industrialist, who between 1897 and 1898 bought each part of the house. He appointed Temple Moore to restore the house and remove numerous earlier additions. This work was mostly completed by 1900 and when Frank Green retired and moved away from York in 1930 the house and its contents were given to the National Trust. The house was built directly over one of the main Roman roads leading out of Roman York to the North. During major structural changes, carried out by Green, four Roman column bases were uncovered, one of which remains in-situ in the cellar and one of which was used as a base for a modern set of columns in the main hall. Public access Treasurer's House is open to the public for a small admission fee, and free to members of the National Trust. The garden and Below Stairs Caf√© are free to enter. Cellar and attic tours are available, depending on the time of year. Roman soldiers apparition Several ghosts reportedly haunt the house, including that of George Aislaby who owned the property in the seventeenth century. However, the most notable haunting is by a group of Roman soldiers who have been witnessed in the cellar, firstly by a party guest of Frank Green and then many years later during restoration works carried out by the National Trust. In 1953, local 18-year-old apprentice plumber Harry Martindale was repairing pipe work in the cellar, the National Trust having decided to remove the coal-fired central heating installed by Green. After about four hours of work at the top of his ladder, Martindale became aware of a musical sound, resembling a series of repeated single trumpet-like notes. The sound grew in intensity until, just below his ladder, Martindale reported that he saw a soldier, wearing a plumed helmet, emerge from the wall, followed by a cart horse and about nine or ten pairs of other Roman soldiers. Martindale fell, terrified, from his ladder and stumbled into a corner to hide. The soldiers appeared to be armed legionaries, visible only from the knees up, in a marching formation, but were \\"scruffy\\". They were distinctive in three ways: they carried round shields on their left arms, they carried some kind of daggers in scabbards on their right side and they wore green tunics. When they descended to the level of the Roman road, on which Martindale had stood his ladder, he was able to see that they wore open sandals with leather straps to the knees. The experience so frightened Martindale that it was several weeks before he returned to his job as a plumber. Many years later, excavations in the city revealed that the descriptions of the soldiers' dress given by Martindale, at first dismissed as anomalous, in fact matched those of local reserve soldiers who took over the Roman garrison when the regular soldiers began returning to Rome in the fifth century. During the course of his long life Martindale recounted his experience many times, but never changed any of the details and always refused any payment. The Treasurer's House was visited in the first episode of the Discovery Channel television series Ghosthunters.

Rudy's Country Store and Bar-B-Q is a barbecue restaurant established in Leon Springs, a district of San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas in 1989. The company operates restaurants in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado and sells products online. Rudy's generally dropped the slogan \\"The wurst bar-b-q in Texas,\\" when the company was acquired 1996, with only some Austin and San Antonio-area locations using it. History Rudy's was established by Rudolph Aue in Leon Springs, Texas (now a part of San Antonio, Texas) in 1929 as a combination business consisting of a filling station, automobile repair shop, and grocery store. In 1989 Rudolph added barbecue to the food menu, combining the grocery and new restaurant element to make a \\"country store\\" feel. Their signature barbecue consists of 100% oak wood smoked meats rather than the usual Texas Mesquite smoke, and special in-house spices. Rudy's later expanded to 47 locations through the states of Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. Now more of a self-service sit down restaurant style establishment, the retail store portion usually consists of a small corner of each location. The company's head offices are currently located in Lakeway, Texas.  Menu  Rudy's has an instructional video on \\"how to cut\\" brisket, but also serves turkey, pork ribs, sausages, beef, pulled pork and breakfast tacos. Sides include coleslaw, creamed corn, spicy pinto beans, new potatoes, potato salad and bread by the whole or half loaf. Soda and beer are sold as beverages and both feature regional selections. Accolades The Daily Meal writes their favorite menu item \\"is the extra moist brisket\\". The former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, dubbed Rudy's in Austin \\"the best of the best\\". On May 31, 2017, Daniel Vaughn of Texas Monthly writes \\"It‚Äôs the best statewide barbecue chain in Texas\\".  NASCAR sponsorship  Rudy's initially jumped in to NASCAR by sponsoring driver Brad Coleman and team Joe Gibbs Racing for three Xfinity Series (then Nationwide) races in 2009, under the name rudys.com The name \\"Rudy's Country Store & BBQ\\" was used for the company's re-entry in 2016 with Garrett Smithley and JD Motorsports.

Decompression speed is faster than bzip2, but slower than gzip. Compression can be much slower than gzip, and is slower than bzip2 for high levels of compression, and is most useful when a compressed file will be used many times. XZ Utils consists of two major components: * xz, the command-line compressor and decompressor (analogous to gzip) * liblzma, a software library with an API similar to zlib Various command shortcuts exist, such as lzma (for xz --format=lzma), unxz (for xz --decompress; analogous to gunzip) and xzcat (for unxz --stdout; analogous to zcat) XZ Utils can compress and decompress both the xz and lzma file formats, but since the LZMA format is now legacy, XZ Utils compresses by default to xz.  Implementation  Both the behavior of the software as well as the properties of the file format have been designed to work similarly to those of the popular Unix compressing tools gzip and bzip2. It consists of a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior. xz support multi-threaded compression (\`-T\` flag)https://man.cx/xz since 2014, version 5.2.0. https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob;f=NEWS;hb=HEAD, as of 2019 threaded decompression hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet. https://man.cx/xz. Number of threads can be less than defined if file is not big enough for threading with the given settings or if using more threads would exceed the memory usage limit. https://man.cx/xz Just like gzip and bzip, xz and lzma can only compress single files (or data streams) as input. They cannot bundle multiple files into a single archive ‚Äì to do this an archiving program is used first, such as tar. Compressing an archive: xz my_archive.tar # results in my_archive.tar.xz lzma my_archive.tar # results in my_archive.tar.lzma Decompressing the archive: unxz my_archive.tar.xz # results in my_archive.tar unlzma my_archive.tar.lzma # results in my_archive.tar Version 1.22 or greater of the GNU implementation of tar has transparent support for tarballs compressed with lzma and xz, using the switches \`--xz\` or \`-J\` for xz compression, and \`--lzma\` for LZMA compression. Creating an archive and compressing it: tar -c --xz -f my_archive.tar.xz /some_directory # results in my_archive.tar.xz tar -c --lzma -f my_archive.tar.lzma /some_directory # results in my_archive.tar.lzma Decompressing the archive and extracting its contents: tar -x --xz -f my_archive.tar.xz # results in /some_directory tar -x --lzma -f my_archive.tar.lzma # results in /some_directory Single letter tar example for archive with compress and decompress with extract using short suffix tar cJf keep.txz keep # archive then compress the directory ./keep/ into the file ./keep.txz tar xJf keep.txz # decompress then extract the file ./keep.txz creating the directory ./keep/  The xz format  The xz format improves on lzma by allowing for preprocessing filters. The exact filters used are similar to those used in 7z, as 7z's filters are available in public domain via the LZMA SDK.  Development and adoption  Development of XZ Utils took place within the Tukaani Project, which was led by Mike Kezner, by a small group of developers who once maintained a Linux distribution based on Slackware. All of the source code for xz and liblzma has been released into the public domain. The XZ Utils source distribution additionally includes some optional scripts and an example program that are subject to various versions of the GPL. Specifically, the full list of GPL scripts and sources distributed with the XZ Utils software include: * An optional implementation of a common libc function, getopt (GNU GPL v2 and GNU LGPL v2.1) * An m4 script for pthread detection (GNU GPL v3) * Some nonessential wrapper scripts (xzgrep, etc) (GNU GPL v2) * And the example program scanlzma, which is not integrated with the build system The resulting software xz and liblzma binaries are public domain, unless the optional LGPL getopt implementation is incorporated. Binaries are available for FreeBSD, Linux systems, Microsoft Windows, and FreeDOS. A number of Linux distributions, including Fedora, Slackware, Ubuntu, and Debian use xz for compressing their software packages. Arch Linux previously used xz to compress packages, but as of December 27, 2019, packages are compressed with Zstandard compression. The GNU FTP archive also uses xz.

Career  Born in Karlstad, he was raised in Deje. Starting his career in Deje IK, he later moved to Carlstad United BK. In 2008, he spent a short time in Degerfors IF, prior to 2009 season he was close to signing for √ñrgryte IS; however he instead signed for local rival GAIS as bosman; this upset Carlstad United as they were only receiving about 200,000 SEK while √ñrgryte IS's bid was claimed to be at least twice as big. On 25 December 2009, it was announced that IFK G√∂teborg had signed him for an undisclosed fee. Ericsson failed to make an impact in G√∂teborg, only scoring once in 17 games and found himself starting on the substitute bench, meanwhile Mj√§llby AIF was faced with problems following the departure of their main forward Moestafa El Kabir to Cagliari, as a result Ericsson was loaned out to Mj√§llby during the summer for the duration of the 2011 season. Prior to the 2012 season he returned to G√∂teborg, in hopes that the new manager Mikael Stahre would give him a chance in the team, he however found himself outside the starting line-up and was soon loaned out to Mj√§llby yet again for the entire season.

Early life and education Washington was born in New York on December 28, 1942, to Samuel Washington and Kathleen Peterson Erby. She majored in English at the City College of New York, graduating with a bachelor's degree. Career After completing college, she worked as a writer, and later as an editor, for several publications, including The New York Post, Essence, Life and Newsweek.Fox, Margalit, \\"Elsie B. Washington, a Novelist, Dies at 66\\", The New York Times, May 16, 2009. Accessed May 18, 2009. Her one and only novel, Entwined Destinies, was published by Dell Publishing in 1980 under the pen name Rosalind Welles as the 575th in its \\"Candlelight Romance\\" series of books. The book, which tells the story of a female African-American magazine reporter who finds true love with an African- American oil executive, was described as \\"the first known romance featuring African-American characters written by an African-American author\\" in a 2002 issue of Black Issues Book Review. By the time of Washington's death, several imprints were devoted to black romance novels, featuring books by authors such as Rochelle Alers, Beverly Jenkins and Sandra Kitt. In 1996, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called Washington the \\"mother of the African-American romance\\", setting the groundwork for a revolution in ethnic romance novels.Wikoff, Katherine. \\"'Mother of ethnic romance' treated genre seriously\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, January 7, 1996. Accessed May 18, 2009. Washington's book was the first \\"ethnic romance\\", a category conceived by Vivian Stephens, an African-American editor at Dell, viewing the book as the first of other such books also aimed at Native Americans and Chinese Americans. The company published 125,000 copies of Washington's novel, primarily distributed in cities on the East Coast with large African-American populations.Walters, Ray. \\"PAPERBACK TALK\\", The New York Times, July 13, 1980. Accessed May 18, 2009. Washington also wrote two works of non-fiction, her 1974 book Sickle Cell Anemia, co-written with Anthony Cerami, and the Uncivil War: The Struggle Between Black Men and Women, published in 1996. A 1998 article she wrote for Essence magazine received notice after she criticized the trend of African Americans who comported to \\"white standards of beauty\\" through the use of tinted contact lenses and other techniques. Death A resident of Yonkers, New York, Washington died in Manhattan at the age of 66 on May 5, 2009, due to multiple sclerosis and cancer. She was survived by her parents and a brother.

It is part of the Dragon Quest series and features monsters from the series. It supports up to four player multiplayer, both local and online. Dragon Quest Wars was announced on May 18, 2009, and was released in Japan on June 24, 2009, in North America on September 28, 2009, and in the PAL regions on October 9, 2009. Gameplay Screenshot showing the general interface and gameplay of Dragon Quest Wars Dragon Quest Wars allows up to four players to battle one another with four monster units each on a four- sided battlefield made up a squares. Battles during the game are limited to five to ten turns. Players move units by touching and dragging them using the DS stylus. Commands are issued to units also by touching and dragging them onto a unit from the bottom of the screen. These commands are color-coded and include red (physical attacks), green (recovery), blue (defence), and yellow (magic). Each monster unit has between one and three hearts. These hearts deplete as monsters are attacked, and when they reach 0, the monster walks off the field. A player can win a battle either when all enemy units are defeated or if one of their units crosses into an enemy's base. Dragon Quest Wars also features \\"survival matches\\", which require the player to set all of their moves within a time limit before the battle begins. The game has six playable units: Slimes, Hammerhood, Dracky, Golem, Chimera, and Healslime. All are recurring monsters in the Dragon Quest series. Development A trademark for Dragon Quest Wars was filed by Square Enix on April 28, 2009. The game was developed by Intelligent Systems as part of a collaboration between Nintendo and Square Enix for Intelligent Systems to design six video games for Square Enix on the DSiWare service. As with most other games in the Dragon Quest franchise, development on Dragon Wars was supervised by Y≈´ji Horii, while Akira Toriyama and Koichi Sugiyama fulfilled their respective duties as character designer and composer. Producer Taichi Inuzuka states that has long been his hope to create simulation game (strategy game) with Dragon Quest. The developers wanted to design a game to \\"convey the fun of simulation games and to provide a gateway to users who‚Äôve never played simulation games.\\" Intelligent Systems previously developed popular simulation titles for Nintendo including the Wars and Fire Emblem series. Reception 1UP.com editor Justin Epperson described Dragon Quest Wars as a board game, going so far as to say he wishes it were a board game so it would be more entertaining. He added however that it was definitely worth the price. Wiiloveit.com offered a high recommendation with a 24/30, praising the \\"surprising amount of strategy\\", as well as the \\"robust\\" online mode which \\"[brought] the title to life\\". Dragon Quest Wars was nominated for Game of the Year by Nintendo Power, as well as DSiWare Game of the Year.

It was founded in 2001 by Michael Osterholm, in order to \\"prevent illness and death from infectious diseases through epidemiological research and rapid translation of scientific information into real-world practical applications and solutions\\".  History  Michael Osterholm founded Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) in 2001. In 2019, CIDRAP partnered with Seattle Children's Research Institute. Primary activitiesNews publishing= CIDRAP's news publishing division writes news stories and maintains information on influenza, bioterrorism, and new hot topics. The CIDRAP news team, through the CIDRAP web site, provides daily news updates on emerging infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza, bioterrorism, food safety, avian influenza, and emerging topics. Along with news articles, the site provides overviews on various infectious disease topics, as well as lists of recent selected literature for each topic. CIDRAP's daily news service has 8,000 current newsletter subscribers and 7,000 Twitter followers. = Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) = Antimicrobial resistance is a critical global public health issue, and antimicrobial stewardship strategies are key to curtailing the problem. CIDRAP's Antimicrobial Stewardship Project provides current, accurate, and comprehensive information on the topic and works to build an online community to address leading issues... = Ebola Vaccine Team B = Wellcome Trust and CIDRAP launched the Ebola vaccine Team B initiative in November 2014 to assist international efforts to develop in record time safe and effective vaccines against Ebola virus disease. The project includes 25 distinguished leaders in public health, medicine, bioethics, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and humanitarian relief. The experts provide a fresh perspective (a Team B analysis) of issues being addressed by international collaborators in the areas of funding, research, development, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness determination, licensure, manufacturing, and vaccination strategy (distribution and administration). To date, Team B has published its findings in the following reports: *\\"Completing the Development of Ebola Vaccines: Current Status, Remaining Challenges, and Recommendations\\" *\\"Plotting the Course of Ebola Vaccines: Challenges and Unanswered Questions\\" *\\"Recommendations for Accelerating Development of Ebola Vaccines: Report and Analysis\\" *\\"Fast-Track Development of Ebola Vaccines: Principles and Target Product Criteria\\" = CIDRAP Leadership Forum = Membership in the CIDRAP Leadership Forum (CLF) connects decisionmakers to intelligence they can trust when they need it most. The CLF is a high-value, highly responsive service offered by CIDRAP that ensures businesses and organizations have rapid access to critical intelligence on emerging infectious disease threats and public health issues. Members say CLF provides insight and analysis they cannot find easily elsewhere. CLF members connect with Michael T. Osterholm, an international authority on emerging infectious diseases, and the comprehensive team of CIDRAP experts through special communications, conference calls, webinars, and special CLF events. =BioWatch= CIDRAP has served as a partner in the federal BioWatch air-monitoring program. This program is responsible for the constant monitoring for potential bioterrorism-related agents in cities throughout the United States. Through its contract with the Department of Homeland Security, CIDRAP provides support for the development of national outdoor and indoor guidance documents, a national epidemiology communications network, and a suite of related program and reference documents. = Minnesota Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (MCEIRS)= The Minnesota Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (MCEIRS), established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and CIDRAP in April 2007, was one of six NIH-supported centers in the United States. The activities of the center, including research and surveillance both domestically and abroad, were focused on the detection, epidemiology, and transmission of avian influenza (AI) viruses with pandemic potential. The primary goal of MCEIRS was to enhance the understanding of how AI viruses evolve, adapt, and spread among animal and human populations. The center closed in April 2014. =Influenza training= The Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance has developed an online training portal that provides e-learning modules on topics related to avian influenza and influenza in general. =CIDRAP Comprehensive Influenza Vaccine Initiative (CCIVI)= In December 2009 a grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation started the CIDRAP Comprehensive Influenza Vaccine Initiative. The primary goal of CCIVI was to review all aspects of 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza vaccine preparedness and response and to review the scientific and programmatic basis for the current seasonal influenza vaccine efforts. The final report, published October 15, 2012, is a review of more than 12,000 peer-reviewed publications, documents, transcripts and notes dating back to 1936 and interviews and follow up with 88 experts in influenza vaccine research, development, and use. = Public Health Practices (PHP)= Public Health Practices (PHP) was a curated compendium of tools, strategies, and downloadables created by US health agencies and partners to prepare for and respond to the health consequences of disasters and emergencies.

The film features discussions with Hayden concerning his life and career, intercut with clips and stills from his films. It follows the actor through several long and digressive afternoon conversations with the German filmmakers aboard the barge in France on which he was living. Hayden smokes hashish and drinks heavily throughout, telling the filmmakers that they \\"have a record of exactly what alcoholism is\\". Hayden recounts his shame at having co-operated with the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Second Red Scare, his pride in his achievements as a sailor, and adopts a scornful attitude towards his illustrious career as a Hollywood film icon. The film was shown at the 1983 Edinburgh Film Festival, where it was one of a few independent films singled out for praise by critic Steve McIntyre in an otherwise disappointing event. In a review for The New York Times, critic Janet Maslin cited the film as an example of \\"documentary film making ... at its most laissez faire\\", lamenting that \\"[e]very discussion is allowed to proceed far beyond its natural conclusion\\". She criticised the filmmakers' reluctance to rein in Hayden's \\"diffuseness of thought\\", \\"stilted\\" cinematography, inclusion of trivial and uninteresting details from the interviews, and their nonchalant and distanced attitude towards the actor.

After beginning play in 1883, the team was first called the \\"Gems\\" in 1907 and had various other nicknames (Ravens, Vets, Giants, Cubs, Jets, Indians), some the same as their major league affiliate. The team was known as the Quincy Ravens from 1890 to 1892, and then again in 1894. The team played in the Illinois Iowa League in 1891 and 1892, before moving to the Western Association in 1894. They were managed by Sam LaRocque and William Wittrock in 1892. Several major leaguers played for the Ravens, one of the most prominent being Sam Gillen who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies. During the 1981 season, Pete Daniels threw 321 innings compiling a 0.79 ERA for the Ravens. The franchise played in the Western Association (1894‚Äì1899), Iowa State League (1907), Central Association (1908‚Äì1910), Three-I League (1911‚Äì1932, 1946‚Äì1956), and the Midwest League (1960‚Äì73). They were affiliated with the New York Yankees (1946‚Äì1956), the San Francisco Giants (1956‚Äì60), New York Mets (1962‚Äì63) and the Chicago Cubs (1965‚Äì1973). Overall, the franchise won a total of nine league championships. Quincy captured the Western Association championship in 1889, and Three-I League Championships in 1913, 1929, 1931, 1951, 1953 and 1954. Quincy won the 1961 and 1970 Midwest League Championships, defeating the Waterloo Hawks in 1961 and the Quad City Angels in 1970. After the 1973 season, the franchise was moved to Dubuque, Iowa playing as the Dubuque Packers in the Midwest League for two seasons, before the franchise was folded and not replaced. The Gems name returned in 2009 by the collegiate summer Prospect League team called the Gems, who also play at a renovated Q Stadium. The ballpark Beginning in 1946, Quincy teams played at Q Stadium. Previously, the team played at Eagles Stadium, which was located at the same site. Q Stadium was constructed on the Eagles Stadium site as a Works Project Administration project in 1939. Q stadium is still an active baseball stadium, located at 1800 Sycamore Street, Quincy, IL 62301. In 1984, the stadium was purchased by Quincy University from the City of Quincy for $1.00. Today, Q Stadium is home to Quincy University teams and the collegiate summer baseball team of the same name, the new Quincy Gems.https://quincygems.com/history-of-the-quincy-gems/Baseball Reference Bullpen Retrieved July 3, 2018.

He became the first judge of the Superior Court of the Territory of Orleans from 1804‚Äì1808, and was American consul at Lima, Peru from 1818 until his death. Early life and family Prevost was born on March 6, 1766 in Paramus, New Jersey. His father Col. Jacques Marcus Prevost had emigrated from Geneva, Switzerland to Britain with his brother General Augustine Prevost, and rose in the British Army to command British forces in New Jersey and was briefly governor of Georgia during the American Revolutionary War before moving to the British West Indies to recover from his wounds and dying in Jamaica in 1779. His widow (and J.B. Prevost's mother), Theodosia Bartow, was a New Jersey native (only daughter of Theodore Bartow of Shrewsbury) and patriot during that war. In 1782, the widow married Aaron Burr.Celebration of the Centenary of the Supreme Court of Louisiana (March 1, 1913), in John Wymond, Henry Plauch√© Dart, eds., The Louisiana Historical Quarterly (1922), p. 113. Burr (who would become Vice President of the United States under Thomas Jefferson) raised Theodosia's sons John and Frederick as his own. John B. Prevost married Frances Anna Smith, daughter of Rev. Samuel Smith, of Princeton College on February 5, 1799. They had four children: Theodosia Ann Prevost (1801‚Äì1864), James Marcus Prevost (1803‚Äì1829), Stanhope Prevost (1804‚Äì1868) and Frances Prevost Breckinridge (1806‚Äì1870).Rev.

Arriving in New Orleans on October 29, 1804, Prevost opened the Superior Court with a charge to the grand jury on Monday, November 5, 1804. Prevost served alone on that bench from November 5, 1804, for about two years, due to the death and refusal to take office of his fellow judges. In 1808, Prevost resigned from the bench and was replaced by Joshua Lewis of Kentucky. Prevost remained in New Orleans and practiced law for several years. In 1818, President James Monroe appointed Prevost as American Commissioner to examine the state of Spanish colonies in South America. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams tasked Prevost to secure the Oregon Territory as reparations from the British government for the War of 1812 as spelled out in the Treaty of Ghent. Prevost moved his family to Peru, where he worked until his death on March 5, 1825, although his formal nomination as Charg√© d'affaires was withdrawn before the Senate could approve it.https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/prevost-john-b His son Stanhope Prevost became a prominent merchant in Lima with Edward McCall (American consul at Lima 1843‚Äì1851), married a Peruvian woman and had children, becoming like his father the American consul in Lima (1851‚Äì1853) and dying there in 1868.

This was a short-lived organisation but, in 1925, another association of chiropractors was formed; the British Chiropractors‚Äô Association.Hancock E ‚Äò‚ÄôThe European Chiropractor‚Äô‚Äô 1933; 2 (3), 5-7 The association began with fewer than 20 members but, despite this, an insurance scheme was set in place for its membership. In the ensuing years, the BCA gradually developed to take the form that it does today. When the British Chiropractic Association announced the purchase of premises in Bournemouth for the establishment of a chiropractic college in 1964, the number of chiropractors practising in the UK was quite small.‚Äô‚ÄôBulletin of the European Chiropractor‚Äôs Union‚Äô‚Äô 1964; 5 (3), 19 The opening of the Anglo- European College of Chiropractic, in 1965, led to a steady increase in the numbers of chiropractors in the UK and, in 2010, there were more than 1,300 practicing members and over 600 student members. Today, members have practices spanning the whole of the United Kingdom and BCA members are graduates of 20 different internationally accredited chiropractic educational institutions. The association only accepts into membership graduates of a Chiropractic degree course validated by a member of the Council of Chiropractic Education International (CCEI). Individual applicants must also ensure their course meets the requirements of the UK regulator, the General Chiropractic Council. The association provides a wide range of services for members and as an information source for the public. The association celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2005.  European Chiropractors Union / World Federation of Chiropractic The BCA was a founder member of the European Chiropractors' Union (ECU) in 1932. The first President of the ECU was Charles Bannister, a British Chiropractor.Minutes of the European Chiropractors Union meetings of Saturday 2 July 1932 and Friday 8 July 1932. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe European Chiropractor‚Äô‚Äô 1932; 1 (1), 2-3 Since then, the association has remained prominently active within the ECU and has been key to the establishment and development of chiropractic education and the chiropractic profession in Europe. When the World Federation of Chiropractic was formed in 1988, the British Chiropractic Association was a founder member and important contributor in the federation‚Äôs development.  Libel case against Simon Singh  In July 2008, the BCA issued libel proceedings against Simon Singh, who has specialised in writing about mathematical and scientific topics, for writing in The Guardian newspaper and website that the association was promoting 'bogus treatments'. In his article, Singh questioned the BCA's claims that chiropractic treatment \\"can help treat children with colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying\\". The BCA asked Singh to retract his allegations because they were \\"factually wrong, defamatory and damaging to the BCA‚Äôs reputation\\". After the BCA won a preliminary court ruling in May 2009, Singh announced in June 2009 that he intended to appeal against the ruling, and on 14 October 2009 Singh was granted leave to appeal. On 29 October 2009, Times Higher Education reported that Singh had won the right to appeal against the preliminary ruling on \\"meaning\\" in the case. Singh responded to the judgement that it was the \\"best possible result\\" but warned that he would try not to get his hopes up. \\"We have only won leave to appeal. Now we must convince the Court of Appeal on the issue of meaning. There is a long battle ahead.\\" In April 2010, Singh won his court appeal for the right to rely on the defence of fair comment. An editorial in Nature commented on the case, and stated that although the BCA has said that it believes in open discussions about the evidence base for chiropractic treatments and beliefs, it instead appears to many observers that the association is trying to use libel laws to suppress debate. Sense About Science has been a major supporter of Singh during this case and editorials in BMJ argued that the lawsuit highlights the chilling effects of English libel law on scientific discourse, and free speech.BMJ 2009;338:b2254 BMJ 2009;339:b4429 BMJ 2009;339:b2783 The backlash to the BCA's libel case has resulted in a lot of coverage in both skeptical and mainstream media, and as such is considered by some to be an example of the Streisand effect. The publicity produced by the BCA's libel action has led to formal complaints of false advertising being made against more than 500 individual chiropractors within one 24-hour period, when these cases were brought for consideration by the General Chiropractic Council, however, 92% were dismissed with \\"no case to answer\\". On 1 April 2010, Singh won a crucial appeal that allowed him to clarify that what he wrote was an opinion and was thus protected by the defence of \\"fair comment\\" in British libel law. In response on 15 April 2010, the BCA officially withdrew its lawsuit, ending the case. The BCA issued a statement the same day outlining their reasons for withdrawing.

History  Queen Elizabeth I Henry III rebuilt Westminster Abbey in honour of the Royal Saint Edward the Confessor whose relics were placed in a shrine in the sanctuary and now lie in a burial vault beneath the 1268 Cosmati mosaic pavement, in front of the High Altar. Henry III himself was interred nearby in a superb chest tomb with effigial monument. Many of the Plantagenet kings of England, their wives and other relatives, were also buried in the Abbey. From the time of Edward the Confessor until the death of George II in 1760, most Kings and Queens of England were buried here, although there are exceptions (most notably Edward IV, Henry VIII and Charles I who are buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle). All monarchs who died after George II were buried in Windsor; most were laid to rest in St George's Chapel, although Queen Victoria and Edward VIII are buried at Frogmore, where the Royal Family also has a private cemetery. Since the Middle Ages, aristocrats were buried inside chapels, while monks and other people associated with the Abbey were buried in the Cloisters and other areas. One of these was Geoffrey Chaucer, who was buried here as he had apartments in the Abbey where he was employed as master of the King's Works. Other poets, writers and musicians were buried or memorialised around Chaucer in what became known as Poets' Corner. These include: W. H. Auden, William Blake, Robert Burns, Lord Byron, Charles Dickens, John Dryden, George Eliot, T. S. Eliot, Thomas Gray, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Samuel Johnson, John Keats, Rudyard Kipling, Jenny Lind, John Masefield, John Milton, Laurence Olivier, Alexander Pope, Nicholas Rowe, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Thomas Shadwell, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth. Abbey musicians such as Henry Purcell were also buried in their place of work. Subsequently, it became one of Britain's most significant honours to be buried or commemorated here. The practice of burying national figures in the Abbey began under Oliver Cromwell with the burial of Admiral Robert Blake in 1657.Westminster Abbey Mrs. A. Murray Smith, published 1904-08-30 The practice spread to include generals, admirals, politicians, doctors and scientists such as Isaac Newton, buried on 4 April 1727 and Charles Darwin, buried 19 April 1882. Eight British Prime Ministers are buried in the Abbey; William Pitt the Elder, William Pitt the Younger, George Canning, Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, William Ewart Gladstone, Bonar Law, Neville Chamberlain and Clement Attlee. During the early 20th century, for reasons of space, it became increasingly common to bury cremated remains rather than coffins. In 1905 the actor Sir Henry Irving was cremated and his ashes buried in the Abbey, thereby becoming the first person ever to be cremated prior to interment. This marked a milestone as after the death of Sir Joseph Hooker in December 1911, the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey chose to offer Hooker a grave near Charles Darwin's in the nave but also insisted that he be cremated before. His widow however declined and so Hooker's body was buried in the churchyard of St Anne's Church, Kew. The majority of interments at the Abbey are of cremated remains, but some burials still take place ‚Äì Frances Challen, wife of the Rev Sebastian Charles, Canon of Westminster, was buried alongside her husband in the south choir aisle in 2014. Members of the Percy family have a family vault, \\"The Northumberland Vault\\", in St Nicholas's chapel, within the Abbey. The ashes of physicist Stephen Hawking were interred in the Abbey on 15 June 2018, near the grave of Sir Isaac Newton. The memorial stone, bearing the inscription 'Here lies what was mortal of Stephen Hawking 1942‚Äì2018', includes a form of the Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking entropy equation relating to black holes. In the floor just inside the great west door, in the centre of the nave, is the tomb of The Unknown Warrior, an unidentified British soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War. He was buried in the Abbey on 11 November 1920. There are many graves in the floors of the Abbey, but this is the only grave on which it is forbidden to walk.

History The present church replaced an earlier one. Though documentary evidence for St John's survives only from the later 12th century, other evidence tends to suggest that a church existed on this site at a significantly earlier date.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol9/pp16-43#h3-0020 According to legend, the original church was built by Saint Dunstan in the tenth century.Brooks, Nicholas: \\"Anglo-Saxon Myths: State and Church, 400 - 1066\\", Hambledon Press, 2000 Recent excavations in the nave have revealed the foundations of a large central tower that possibly dated from Saxon times, and a later Norman nave arcade on the same plan as the existing one. A central tower survived until the 15th century, but is believed to have collapsed, at which time the church was rebuilt.http://www.stjohns-glastonbury.org.uk (official church website) In the north aisle, 12th-century fabric survives in the former Saint Katherine's Chapel.\\"Great Britain: The Green Guide\\", By Michelin Travel & Lifestyle, 2012 The church was used for shelter by Monmouth's troops in June 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion. It is also recorded that on four occasions between 1800 and 1804, French prisoners of war were locked up for the night inside the church, presumably whilst in transit.Boyd, Martin: \\"St John the Baptist, Glastonbury\\" (Church Guide) Between 1856-57 the church was restored and reseated by Sir George Gilbert Scott at a cost of ¬£3000, and its gothic character re-emphasized. The church conforms in its entirety to a style of architecture known as Perpendicular Gothic. The church is built of Doulting stone, Street stone and the local Tor burr, and is laid out in a cruciform plan with an aisled nave and a clerestory of seven bays. Interior Interior of the church The interior of the church includes four 15th-century tomb-chests, some 15th-century stained glass in the chancel, medieval vestments, and a domestic cupboard of about 1500 which was once at Witham Charterhouse. At the front of the tower are two large carvings, the 'Madonna with Child' and the 'Resurrection Christ' ‚Äì early works of Ernst Blensdorf, carved in 1945, after his escape from the Nazis. Tower and Bells The west tower has elaborate buttressing, panelling and battlements. The tower rises to a height of 134¬Ω feet (about 41 metres), and is the second tallest parish church tower in Somerset. During the 15th century the present tower at the western end of the church replaced an earlier central tower. The tower is said to have inspired numerous others, including the tower of Northington Parish Church in Hampshire.Brian l Harris: \\"Guide to Churches and Cathedrals\\", Ebury Press, 2006. The tower is unusual in that it has a chiming clock, but no clock face. There has been a set of bells at St John's Church since 1403. The oldest existing bell was originally made in 1612 and inscribed 'I sound to bid the sick repent in hope of life when breath is spent'. This bell was recast in 1992. The ring of six bells was augmented to a ring of eight in 1878A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 9, Glastonbury and Street. Originally published by Victoria County History, London, 2006. The largest, the tenor bell, is about 14 cwt or about 712 kg and the smallest, the treble, is about 5 cwt or 250 kg. Churchyard St John's in summer 2010 Tercentennial Labyrinth, St John's Churchyard, Glastonbury In the churchyard is a thorn tree grown from a cutting from the Glastonbury Thorn. A blossom from this tree is sent to the Queen every Christmas. At the end of term, the pupils of St John's Infants School gather round the tree in St John's parish churchyard on the High Street. They sing carols, including one specially written for the occasion, and the oldest pupil has the privilege of cutting the branch of the Glastonbury Thorn that is then taken to London and presented to Her Majesty The Queen. The tercentennial labyrinth, located close to the church gates, was laid in 2007, to celebrate Glastonbury receiving its town charter from Queen Anne in 1705. This is a grass labyrinth of the classical seven circuit design, its path delineated by blue lias stonework, which is a local stone present in the Tor. The labyrinth was conceptualized and designed by Sig Lonegren (a Glastonbury geomancer and author). The laying of the labyrinth was delayed due to various problems in securing a site.https://druidnetwork.org/what-is-druidry/beliefs-and-definitions/sacred- places/glastonburys-tercentennial-labyrinth/ List of Vicars *Richard Prat, BA 1744 - 1778http://www.butleigh.org/butleighpeople/ButleighPeopleP.html *Matthew Hodge 1783 - 1808Clergy of the Church of England Database, Person ID 43377 *John Townsend, MA 1809 - 1812Foster, Joseph: Alumni Oxonienses, Vol IV (1715-1886), p 1431 *Thomas Parfitt, DD 1812 - 1865Obituary - Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 79 (1865) *Charles Sydenham Ross, MA 1865 - 1893London Evening Standard, 29.12.1893The Guardian, Obituary, 03.01.1894 *Prebendary Henry Lowry Barnwell, MA 1894 - 1912Venn, John: Alumni Cantabrigienses *Charles Victor Parkinson Day, MA, CBE, TD 1912 - 1921The Durham University Journal, Volume 22, Page 371 *Lionel Smithett Lewis, MA 1921 - 1950Venn, John: Alumni Cantabrigienses, 1951 *Prebendary Bernard F Cooper, BD 1950Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, 14 October 1950 *Hugh William Hartly Knapman, BA, RD 1955 Crockford's Clerical Directory, Issue 81, 1965 *Alan Geoffrey Clarkson, MA 1974 Crockford's Clerical Directory, Issue 90, 1987, p.108 *Patrick John Riley 1984 - 2001 *Maxine Marsh 2002 - 2007 (Priest-in- Charge)Church Times, Obituary 05.07.2013 *David MacGeoch, RD 2008‚ÄìPresent Thomas Parfitt has been the longest serving vicar of Glastonbury, having held the office for more than 52 years, between December 1812 and his death, aged 88 years, in January 1865. Dr Parfitt was also vicar of St Benedict's Church, Glastonbury, until this became a separate cure in 1845.Bristol Times and Mirror, 16 January 1865 Charles Sydenham Ross was a curate at Glastonbury for seven years, until succeeding Dr Thomas Parfitt as vicar in 1865. Mr Ross was noted as having been \\"of Scotch extraction, born at sea off the coast of Portugal\\". He died during a service at Glastonbury Parish Church on Christmas Eve, 1893 and a local newspaper remarked, \\"The manner of his death was beautifully touching, for he sank quietly to rest as his congregation were singing the Nunc Dimittis\\". Mr Ross had been unwell for many months and the bulk of the work in the parish had been carried out by the Reverend H.L Barnwell, who was to succeed him.The Bristol Mercury, 29 December 1893 Henry Lowry Barnwell was licensed as a curate to Saint John's in 1889.Western Daily Press, 14 November 1889 He served as vicar for 18 years, until his death in 1912 and in the following year, a beautifully designed oak screen was erected to his memory in the side chapel.Wels Journal, 13 June 1913 Charles Victor Parkinson Day volunteered for service soon after the outbreak of World War One, as a chaplain to the forces, his rank being equal to that of colonel. Consequently, although he was Vicar of Glastonbury for nine years, more than half of this time was spent in France, Mesopotamia and other war areas. The Reverend Herbert Davies took charge of the parish during his absence. Mr Day remained with the troops for the duration of the war and was appointed a CBE. He died suddenly at Clifton in 1921.Wells Journal, 26 August 1921 Lionel Smithett Lewis was a prominent member of the Church Anti-vivisection League (founded in 1889) and also a founder of Blue Cross, which campaigned against the inhumane treatment of horses at the front during the First World War. Following his appointment as Vicar of Glastonbury in 1921, he developed a passionate interest in the Holy Grail and the legends of Joseph of Arimathea and became a well-known author on the subject.http://www.stgite.org.uk/stmarkwhitechapel.html Mr Lewis was succeeded by Bernard F Cooper, who had been vicar of Bathwick and Rural Dean of BathBath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, 14 October 1950, and then by Hugh William Hartly Knapman, who had been vicar of Long Ashton since 1938. Alan Clarkson later became Archdeacon of Winchester.The Independent, 04.01.1999: Church resignations and retirements. Current Ministry and Profile The current vicar of Saint John's, Glastonbury is the Reverend David MacGeoch, assisted by the Reverend Sister Diana Greenfield, the Reverend Robin Ray and a team of lay readers. It is linked with the parishes of St Benedict's Church in Glastonbury and St Mary's & All Saints Church in the village of Meare as a joint benefice. Music The church has a strong musical tradition and close ties with the nearby Cathedral of Wells. A surpliced choir and processions at St John's was first introduced by Charles Sydenham Ross, incumbent from 1865. Today, St John's choir is made up of a large group of adults and juniors under the direction of Matthew Redman, organist and choirmaster. The choir is of such a standard that it sings regularly in the cathedrals of Exeter, Salisbury, Hereford and Wells. With the help of the Cathedral School in Wells and the Wells Cathedral organist, Saint John's Glastonbury has been able to develop a scholarship, whereby each year an organ scholar is appointed to work with the Director of Music to gain experience of working within a parish church.

The series stars Jenna Elfman and was produced by BermanBraun and CBS Television Studios. The show is based on the book of the same name by Mary F. Pols. On May 18, 2010, CBS cancelled the series after one season. Plot Accidentally on Purpose follows Billie (Jenna Elfman), a San Francisco movie critic in her 30s. Billie meets Zack (Jon Foster), an aspiring chef in his 20s, at a local bar and they have a one-night stand. She soon finds out that she is pregnant, and decides to keep the baby. She must simultaneously deal with her boss and ex-boyfriend, James (Grant Show), who finds himself jealous of Zack. Before the story began, she had hoped that James would ask her to marry him, but he told her that he was not ready because he was married once before. Thanks to this unexpected arrival, Billie and Zack have agreed to live together platonically, since the only place that Zack has called home is his van. While Billie receives encouragement and advice from her alcoholic best friend Olivia (Ashley Jensen) and her conventional, younger, married sister Abby (Lennon Parham), she also has to deal with Zack's freeloading friend Davis (Nicolas Wright), among others, when they start turning her place into a frat house, leaving Billie to question whether she is living with a boyfriend, a roommate, or a second child to raise. Theme song The theme song for the show is \\"Birds of a Feather\\", written by David Fagin of the indie-rock band The Rosenbergs. The song is on their album Department Store Girl.Department Store Girl at the Rosenbergs' website History On November 3, 2009, CBS ordered an additional five episodes of the series, bringing the total to 18. In early 2010 CBS moved Accidentally on Purpose to Wednesday nights from Mondays, to accommodate the midseason return of Rules of Engagement and the cancellation of Gary Unmarried. However, after the ratings slipped CBS elected not to renew the series and on May 18, 2010, made the cancellation official; the cancellation was part of CBS' decision to eliminate all of its Wednesday night comedies in favor of trying a Thursday-night block. Critical reception Accidentally on Purpose received mixed reviews, scoring a 50/100 on Metacritic, while scoring a 6.2/10 with viewers. The New York Times, in a review of the show's first episode, called Grant Show's performance \\"graceful\\" and said Elfman is as \\"funny as the script allows, in that broad, robo-comic way you may remember from Dharma & Greg.\\" The series had an average of eight million viewers per episode while airing on Mondays after How I Met Your Mother, but fell to an average of 5.5 million of viewers per episode while airing on Wednesdays after The New Adventures of Old Christine, which was also canceled in 2010.

Retrieved 3 February 2017 was a British pop and easy listening composer, arranger, songwriter and record producer. In 1961, Schroeder won an Ivor Novello Award for co-writing \\"Walkin' Back to Happiness\\". Life and career Schroeder worked as an A&R; assistant to Norrie Paramor at Columbia Records. He was also a songwriter and, with Mike Hawker, wrote the song \\"Walkin' Back to Happiness\\", which in a version by Helen Shapiro reached number one in the UK Singles Chart during 1961. Schroeder also co-wrote two other hits for Shapiro, \\"Don't Treat Me Like a Child\\", a UK number 3 and \\"You Don't Know\\", which also reached number 1 in August 1961. Later he moved to independent British label, Oriole as A&R; chief, and whilst he was there he brokered an early licensing deal with Motown for British distribution on the label. It subsequently issued such singles as The Contours' \\"Do You Love Me\\" and \\"Fingertips\\" by Little Stevie Wonder. In the mid 1960s, Schroeder moved to Pye and formed the instrumental pop outfit Sounds Orchestral with Johnny Pearson. They had an international hit with their version of \\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\\", which included reaching No. 5 in the UK chart. With this group as well as under several other names, including his own, he released a large number of easy listening covers of popular songs. While many of these saw little critical acclaim upon release, there was a resurgence in interest in them in the 1990s, when they became popular tracks in London dance clubs, and appeared on soundtracks to films such as the Ocean's Eleven franchise. During his tenure with Pye, Schroeder oversaw their Piccadilly subsidiary label, producing singles by artists such as Keith & Billie on \\"Swingin' Tight\\"Brumbeat.net and eventually launching the career (after several false starts) of Status Quo, beginning in 1968 with their first hit, \\"Pictures of Matchstick Men\\". In the early 1970s, John Schroeder started Alaska Records, best known for the label's work with Cymande. and produced \\"Hands Across The Sea\\", which was one of The Dooleys earliest recordings, written by Ben Findon. The Alaska label was subsequently joined by another founded by Schroeder, Janus Records. In the early 1980s, John Schroeder moved to Canada, living and working there until the early 1990s. He started Centamark International with Gary Bizzo in Vancouver as consultants to the music industry in 1981. He later lived in Surrey, England. His autobiography, Sex and Violins was published in 2009. Two years later, Schroeder again became an author, writing and publishing a second book titled, Cozy Cats Cottage plc. This book is unrelated to the music industry and told the story of fictional character Angela Tillsworthy, and how she formed a company employing friendly cats to help the needy. It was published in 2011. Death John Schroeder died at his home on 31 January 2017 after a long battle with cancer. He was 82 years old. His funeral took place at Randall's Park Crematorium on 3 March 2017.

Jazz standards are musical compositions that are widely known, performed and recorded by jazz artists as part of the genre's musical repertoire. This list includes compositions written in the 1920s that are considered standards by at least one major book publication or reference work. Some of the tunes listed were already well-known standards by the 1930s, while others were popularized later. The time of the most influential recordings of a song, where appropriate, is indicated on the list. A period known as the \\"Jazz Age\\" started in the United States in the 1920s. Jazz had become popular music in the country, although older generations considered the music immoral and threatening to old cultural values. Dances such as the Charleston and the Black Bottom were very popular during the period, and jazz bands typically consisted of seven to twelve musicians. Important orchestras in New York were led by Fletcher Henderson, Paul Whiteman and Duke Ellington. Many New Orleans jazzmen had moved to Chicago during the late 1910s in search of employment; among others, the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band and Jelly Roll Morton recorded in the city. However, Chicago's importance as a center of jazz music started to diminish toward the end of the 1920s in favor of New York. In the early years of jazz, record companies were often eager to decide what songs were to be recorded by their artists. Popular numbers in the 1920s were pop hits such as \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\", \\"Dinah\\" and \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\". The first jazz artist to be given some liberty in choosing his material was Louis Armstrong, whose band helped popularize many of the early standards in the 1920s and 1930s. Some compositions written by jazz artists have endured as standards, including Fats Waller's \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" and \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\". The most recorded 1920s standard is Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish's \\"Stardust\\". Several songs written by Broadway composers in the 1920s have become standards, such as George and Ira Gershwin's \\"The Man I Love\\" (1924), Irving Berlin's \\"Blue Skies\\" (1927) and Cole Porter's \\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\" (1929). However, it was not until the 1930s that musicians became comfortable with the harmonic and melodic sophistication of Broadway tunes and started including them regularly in their repertoire. 1920‚Äì1923 *1920 ‚Äì \\"Avalon\\"The Real Book, Volume II, p. 25Listed in The Real Vocal Book is a song written by Al Jolson, Buddy DeSylva and Vincent Rose. Jolson introduced the song, taking it to number two on the charts in 1921, and used it in the musicals Sinbad and Bombo. The song was possibly written by Rose, but Jolson's popularity as a performer allowed him to claim co-credit. The opening melody was taken from Giacomo Puccini's aria E lucevan le stelle from the opera Tosca, and the composers were successfully sued by Puccini's publishers in 1921 for $25,000 and all subsequent royalties. * 1920 ‚Äì \\"Margie\\" is a song composed by Con Conrad and J. Russel Robinson with lyrics by Benny Davis. It was introduced by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and popularized by Eddie Cantor's 1921 recording. The song was one of the first hits for both Conrad and Davis, and was later used in the films Margie (1946) and The Eddie Cantor Story (1954). The name was inspired by Cantor's five- year-old daughter. The song is also known as \\"My Little Margie\\". * 1921 ‚Äì \\"The Sheik of Araby\\" is a song composed by Ted Snyder with lyrics by Harry B. Smith and Francis Wheeler. It was written in response to the popularity of the Rudolph Valentino film The Sheik. The Club Royal Orchestra introduced the song on their first recording in 1921. The two recordings of trombonist Jack Teagarden have been cited as a big influence for the song's standard status. * 1922 ‚Äì \\"Bugle Call Rag\\" is a jazz song by Billy Meyers, Jack Pettis and Elmer Schoebel. It was first recorded by the Friar's Society Orchestra (later the New Orleans Rhythm Kings) and popularized by Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller in the 1930s. Duke Ellington based his 1939 composition \\"The Sergeant Was Shy\\" on the song. The original recording of the song was titled \\"Bugle Call Blues\\". * 1922 ‚Äì \\"China Boy\\" is a song by Phil Boutelje and Dick Winfree. It was first recorded by Arnold Johnson and His Orchestra in 1922, and was popularized by Paul Whiteman's 1929 recording featuring a solo by Bix Beiderbecke. The 1927 recording by McKenzie and Condon's Chicagoans defined the early sound of Chicago style jazz. Benny Goodman's 1935 recording revived interest in the song, and it was performed in Goodman's Carnegie Hall concert in 1938. Sidney Bechet and Muggsy Spanier recorded a definitive version March 28, 1940. * 1922 ‚Äì \\"Farewell Blues\\" is a jazz composition by Paul Mares, Leon Roppolo and Elmer Schoebel of the Friar's Society Orchestra. It was used as the band's theme music, and their performances at the Friar's Inn influenced several younger white jazzmen, such as Bud Freeman and Jimmy McPartland.

Introduced by Elisabeth Welch in the 1923 Broadway musical Runnin' Wild, its success brought the Charleston dance to international popularity. Johnson's original rhythmic accompaniment inspired several later songs, many of which used the word \\"Charleston\\" in the title. The song was played in the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life, with James Stewart and Donna Reed, at a dance scene. It was also a featured production number in the 1950 film Tea for Two.

It begins as a fantasy novel, then develops characteristics generally attributed to science fiction novels. The book has been marketed as YA fiction.Serving Your Fellow Man: An Interview with Peadar O'Guilin Characters *Stopmouth - the main character. A young man, in his late teens or early twenties. He is from the Human Tribe. Stopmouth is named because of his stuttering way of speech. He is generally looked down on by the rest of his tribe because of this, many of them thinking he is dim-witted. His speed is unmatched in the tribe. *Wallbreaker - Stopmouth's brother. He is very observant, and prefers to hunt methodically using traps rather than using sheer force. By using his cunning intellect, he becomes Chief after Speareye's untimely death. *Speareye - the Chief of the Human Tribe. He is a well-respected leader and dies honorably in battle. *Indrani - a mysterious woman who falls from the sky. Most members of the Human Tribe are fearful of her dark skin and abnormally perfect figure. She is hauntingly beautiful. A language barrier keeps her from communicating with the human tribe, but as time progresses, she begins to learn the language. *Rockface - a good friend to Stopmouth. Decorated with tattoos recounting his heroic deeds, he is a very respected man in the tribe and a superb hunter - his strength is envied. *Mossheart - the love interest of both Wallbreaker and Stopmouth. After her marriage to Wallbreaker early in the novel, Stopmouth's feelings for her eventually recede. *Varaha - a man of similar complexion and perfection to Indrani. His physical prowess and hunting abilities are far superior to the primitive tribe members. *Crunchfist - the strongest member of the Human Tribe. He is cruel and harsh, and is feared more than respected. He is undoubtedly the fiercest man Stopmouth has ever met. Plot summary Stopmouth is a member of the Human tribe, which is on the verge of extinction. There is a vast variety of different species of sentient creatures, all of whom either have made alliances with the humans, or hunt them as a source of food. In return, in order to survive in this barbaric world, the humans hunt other species and \\"trade flesh\\", a tradition that has the humans trade the weakest and most useless members of their tribe to other species as a source of food. In the book, this is known as \\"volunteering\\", and it is considered shameful to attempt to resist being volunteered for the good of your tribe. Stopmouth himself (who is said to be around 5,000 days old, around 13 years old) is constantly overlooked and overshadowed because of both his stuttering speech impediment and his more popular brother, Wallbreaker. One day Stopmouth meets a woman named Indrani. Indrani fell from the sky when one of the mysterious globes that fly across the 'Roof' (the Human tribe's name for the sky, basically) explodes, and she is expelled from it. Indrani seems to be more civilized than Stopmouth's tribe, and is disdainful of them. The Human tribe believes her to be 'slow', or stupid, because she cannot speak their language, and their experience has been that there is only one Human tribe. She was going to be volunteered, but Wallbreaker took her as a wife (partly because of her beauty, and partly because one's status is raised when one has more than one wife), protecting her from being traded. Eventually, a great war ensues over a piece of technology known to the barbarians as 'the talker'. It allows different species to communicate with each other, thus making them easier to coordinate alliances with. It eventually gets to the point where most of the species opposing the Humans are destroyed, and Wallbreaker (having been elected chief by this point) takes possession of the talker, which becomes a coveted artifact. Stopmouth, who has come to love Indrani and resent Wallbreaker for taking her before he did, steals Indrani from him and, at her request, the talker. He is pursued across the land by his tribe until they eventually lose their pursuers. Stopmouth (having travelled to a distant part of the land) eventually becomes the surrogate chief of a tribe of religious humans who are on the verge of being wiped out by a strange race of creatures. With his help, they learn to fend for themselves. Indrani reveals toward the end of the book that she comes from a tribe of Humans who live in the Roof, and actually watch the Humans below fight for their lives as a form of entertainment. Stopmouth is devastated by this, but eventually they reconcile, as Indrani has come to a different view of his people, and now holds a degree of respect for them where there had only been disdain before. The book ends when Varaha‚Äîa member of Stopmouth's new tribe of humans and a secret member of Indrani's old Roof tribe‚Äîconfronts Stopmouth while Indrani is being reclaimed by her 'civilized' people. Stopmouth manages to kill Varaha, but Indrani is returned to the Roof.

Jazz standards are musical compositions that are widely known, performed and recorded by jazz artists as part of the genre's musical repertoire. This list includes compositions written in the 1930s that are considered standards by at least one major fake book publication or reference work. Some of the tunes listed were already well known standards by the 1940s, while others were popularized later. Where appropriate, the years when the most influential recordings of a song were made are indicated in the list. Broadway theatre contributed some of the most popular standards of the 1930s, including George and Ira Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" (1935), Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's \\"My Funny Valentine\\" (1937) and Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's \\"All the Things You Are\\" (1939). These songs still rank among the most recorded standards. Johnny Green's \\"Body and Soul\\" was used in a Broadway show and became a hit after Coleman Hawkins's 1939 recording. It is the most recorded jazz standard of all time. In the 1930s, swing jazz emerged as a dominant form in American music. Duke Ellington and his band members composed numerous swing era hits that have become standards: \\"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\\" (1932), \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" (1933) and \\"Caravan\\" (1936), among others. Other influential bandleaders of this period were Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway and Fletcher Henderson. Goodman's band became well-known from the radio show Let's Dance and in 1937 introduced a number of jazz standards to a wide audience in the first jazz concert performed in Carnegie Hall. 1930 alt=A man in his late thirties is sitting sideways on a chair or a couch.

The song was used in the successful Broadway revue Three's a Crowd and became an instant hit, despite being banned from the radio for almost a year for its sexually suggestive lyrics.

His numerous standards include \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" (1933), \\"In a Sentimental Mood\\" (1935), \\"Cotton Tail\\" (1940), and \\"Satin Doll\\" (1953). Jazz standards are musical compositions that are widely known, performed, and recorded by jazz artists as part of the genre's musical repertoire. This list includes tunes written in the 1940s that are considered standards by at least one major fake book publication or reference work. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \\"Cotton Tail\\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \\"Take the 'A' Train\\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \\"rhythm and blues\\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. Bebop emerged in the early 1940s, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and others. It appealed to a more specialized audience than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos, and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \\"Salt Peanuts\\" (1941) and \\"A Night in Tunisia\\" (1942), Parker's \\"Anthropology\\" (1946), \\"Yardbird Suite\\" (1946) and \\"Scrapple from the Apple\\" (1947), and Monk's \\"'Round Midnight\\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. 1940 Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie was one of the leading figures of bebop. Standards composed by him include \\"A Night in Tunisia\\" (1942), \\"Woody N' You\\" (1942), and \\"Groovin' High\\" (1944). * \\"All Too Soon\\" is a jazz ballad composed by Duke Ellington with lyrics by Carl Sigman. Tenor saxophonist Ben Webster's performance on the tune was so highly regarded by audiences that his successors in the band were asked how they dare sit on Webster's seat. Webster later recorded the tune with young Sarah Vaughan in 1946. * \\"Cotton Tail\\"The Real Book, Volume I, p. 90. is a swing jazz composition by Duke Ellington, with lyrics later added by Jon Hendricks.

Standards composed by him include \\"Donna Lee\\" (1947), \\"Solar\\" (1954), \\"Milestones\\" (1958) and \\"So What\\" (1959). Jazz standards are musical compositions that are widely known, performed and recorded by jazz artists as part of the genre's musical repertoire. This list includes tunes written in or after the 1950s that are considered standards by at least one major fake book publication or reference work. Modal jazz recordings, such as Miles Davis's Kind of Blue, became popular in the late 1950s. Popular modal standards include Davis's \\"All Blues\\" and \\"So What\\" (both 1959), John Coltrane's \\"Impressions\\" (1963) and Herbie Hancock's \\"Maiden Voyage\\" (1965). Later, Davis's \\"second great quintet\\", which included saxophonist Wayne Shorter and pianist Herbie Hancock, recorded a series of highly acclaimed albums in the mid-to-late 1960s. Standards from these sessions include Shorter's \\"Footprints\\" (1966) and Eddie Harris's \\"Freedom Jazz Dance\\" (1966). In Brazil, a new style of music called bossa nova evolved in the late 1950s. Based on Brazilian samba as well as jazz, bossa nova was championed by Jo√£o Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonf√°. Gilberto and Stan Getz started a bossa nova craze in the United States with their 1963 album Getz/Gilberto. Among the genre's songs that are now considered standards are Bonf√°'s \\"Manh√£ de Carnaval\\" (1959), Marcos Valle's \\"Summer Samba\\" (1966), and numerous Jobim songs, including \\"Desafinado\\" (1959), \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1962) and \\"Corcovado\\" (1962). The jazz fusion movement fused jazz with other musical styles, most famously funk and rock. Its golden age was from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. Top fusion artists, such as Weather Report, Return to Forever, Herbie Hancock and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, achieved cross-over popularity, although public interest in the genre faded at the turn of the 1980s.

The idea was invented by Jane Jacobs who spun off from the idea of import substitution developed by Andre Gunder Frank and widely discussed during the first and second Latin American debt crisis. Import substitution is a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since, in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.

Founded in 1931 by Clifford Clinton, the design of the restaurants included exotic decor and facades that were \\"kitschy and theatrical\\", and would eventually include multi-story fake redwood trees, stuffed lions, neon plants, and a petrified wood bar. Some considered Clifton's as a precursor to the first tiki bars. The name was created by combining \\"Clifford\\" and \\"Clinton\\" to produce \\"Clifton's\\". The second Clifton's facility opened in 1935 at 648 S Broadway. In 1939 its name was changed to 'Clifton's Brookdale', and as the sole survivor of the multiple branches over 79 years, it is now known as 'Clifton's Cafeteria' or simply as \\"Clifton's\\". It has remained in operation for 74 years. The restaurant chain was noted for each facility having its own theme, and for aiding those who could not afford to pay. This approach to business reflected the owner's Christian ethos--he never turned anyone away hungry and maintained a precedent set by the first restaurant on Olive Street, known as \\"Clifton's Golden Rule\\". In 1946, Clifford and his wife Nelda sold their cafeteria interests to their three younger Clinton children, and retired to devote their attentions to a Meals for Millions, a non-profit charitable organization he founded in the wake of World War II to distribute food to millions of starving and malnourished people throughout the world. Clifton's Brookdale was sold to nightclub operator Andrew Meieran on September 21, 2010. Meieran intended renovations to preserve its unique atmosphere, as well the restaurant's 1950-style recipes. In February 2012 Meieran said the remodeling was expected to continue for another 18 months. Clifton's Brookdale reopened October 1, 2015. History The Clinton family's five generations as California restaurateurs began when David Harrison Clinton came to Los Angeles from Missouri in 1888 and purchased the Southern Hotel and its dining room in downtown Los Angeles. David's son Edmond settled in San Francisco, where he and his wife Gertrude became co-owners of a group of cafeteria-style restaurants named Dennets. Clifford, one of Edmond's five children, learned the restaurant trade while working in his father's restaurants. Along with two partners, he bought his father's interest in Dennets. Due to differences in opinion over business practices, he relinquished ownership to his partners and moved to Los Angeles in 1931. Establishing his restaurants during the height of the Great Depression, and using knowledge gained from working in his family's cafeteria chain in San Francisco, Clinton made a point to never turn anyone away, even if they had no money, seeking to average only a half-cent profit per customer. During one 90-day period, 10,000 people ate free before he was able to open an emergency \\"Penny Caveteria\\" in a basement (hence the modified name) a few blocks away to feed two million patrons during the next two years. Fare The restaurants have always been cafeteria style with each dish sold on a pay-per-item basis. Featured are fountain soft drinks and classic American fare such as roast beef, brisket, meatloaf, and turkey, with a wide assortment of traditional sides. Revolving daily specials often include a fish plate and a fried chicken plate, both of which come with mashed potatoes and vegetables, and in keeping with the eatery‚Äôs retro spirit, there is also a selection of Jello salads, soups, vegetables, breads and classic desserts such as cakes and pies. Additionally, Clifton's offers vegan options. Clifton's desserts were voted \\"Best Desserts\\" by L.A. Downtown News' readers in 2001. Branches Circa 1939, the WPA-sponsored American Guide Series Los Angeles guidebook described the chain thusly: \\"Clifton‚Äôs Brookdale, 648 S. Broadway, and Clifton's Cafeteria of the Golden Rule, 618 S. Olive St. Organ music and singing attendants. A novel feature at both places is the bulletin board just outside the entrance, where listings are displayed for employment, barter, sightseeing, and appeals for congenial friendship. At Brookdale a 'country' atmosphere has been created with artificial trees, vines, brook, and waterfall. Inexpensive.\\" = Founding branch: Clifton's Pacific Seas = Clifton's Pacific Seas postcard circa 1940s In 1931, Clinton leased a \\"distressed\\" cafeteria location at 618 South Olive Street in Los Angeles and founded what his customers referred to as \\"The Cafeteria of the Golden Rule\\". Patrons were obliged to pay only what they felt was fair, according to a neon sign that flashed \\"PAY WHAT YOU WISH.\\" The cafeteria, at the western terminus of U.S. Route 66, was notable for serving people of all races, and was included in The Negro Motorist Green Book. In 1939, the founders of Clifton‚Äôs remodeled the restaurant to change it from a conventional dining establishment to a more exotic setting and renamed it \\"Clifton's Pacific Seas\\". The exterior and interior were decorated with 12 waterfalls, volcanic rock, and tropical foliage. Tiki historian Sven Kirsten claims it had a \\"sherbert-gushing volcano\\". Brightly illuminated in the evening, it became a mecca for tourists and Angelenos alike, often being referred to in the same category as other prominent landmarks of downtown Los Angeles, such as Angels Flight, Olvera Street, and Pershing Square. Initially, the Los Angeles Architectural Commission was so unhappy with the facade and the decor that they threatened suit. One of the many interior themes of the Pacific Seas included \\"The Garden\\" as a setting done in the period AD 33. The Garden was first conceived by Clifford E. Clinton in 1943 as an interpretation of the famous artist Heinrich Hofmann's Christ in Gethsemane. Clinton commissioned sculptor Marshall Lakey to fashion a life-sized figure of Christ, kneeling in prayer. The mural behind Christ, depicting the city of Jerusalem and the Garden of Gethsemane was painted by artist Einar C. Petersen. Clifton's Pacific Seas was visited by Jack Kerouac who wrote in On the Road of visiting \\"a cafeteria downtown which was decorated to look like a grotto, with metal tits spurting everywhere and great impersonal stone buttockses belonging to deities and soapy Neptune. People ate lugubrious meals around the waterfalls, their faces green with marine sorrow\\". In 1960, although the three-story structure with its cascading waterfall facade had become a landmark over the preceding 29 years, the original Clifton's Pacific Seas was closed, the building was razed, and the location turned into a parking lot. A much smaller version in the form of a side-room bar and named the Pacific Seas resides at their still existing location and pays homage to the original and its history. It is viewed by some as being one of southern California's best Tiki bars. = Surviving branch: Clifton's Brookdale = Inside Clifton's Brookdale With a still-existing motto of \\"Dine Free Unless Delighted\\", Clifton's second Golden Rule was opened in 1935 when Clifford Clinton purchased the lease of the former Boos Brothers Cafeteria at 648 S Broadway in Los Angeles. Having himself spent time as a youth the Santa Cruz Mountains not far from the Brookdale Lodge, he chose to redecorate the facility in 1939 to pattern it after the lodge. Working with rock sculptor Francois Scotti, Clifford created a 20-foot waterfall \\"cascading into a quiet stream\\" which then \\"meandered\\" through the dining room, past faux redwood trees used to conceal the room's steel columns. Renowned Los Angeles muralist, Einar C. Petersen, created a life size forest on canvas to cover one wall, and a small chapel was set among the crags to fulfill Clifford's desire to feed the soul as well as the body of depression-weary Angelinos. After refurbishment, he renamed the location \\"Clifton's Brookdale\\". The interior includes a stuffed moose head, animated raccoons, and a fishing bear. The restaurant is described as one of the last vestiges of Old Broadway in downtown Los Angeles, with an interior that looks like a \\"slightly down-at- the-heels Disney version of a twilight forest\\". In June 2006, co-owner Robert Clinton took final steps to purchase the Broadway building they had been leasing for 71 years. With over 600 seats on three floors, and known today as \\"Clifton's Cafeteria\\", it is noted as the oldest cafeteria in Los Angeles and the largest public cafeteria in the world. The third floor includes a party room, a banquet room, and many pictures of Clifford and Nelda Clinton. There is a secret room on an upper floor. There is also another set of restrooms down the stairs in the bottom basement. The restaurant's busiest period was in the 1940s, with as many as 10,000 customers forming lines down Broadway, but as of 2009 Clifton's still regularly serves 1,800 to 2,000 daily. In September 2010, Clifton's Brookdale was sold to nightclub operator Andrew Meieran, who stated that he intends to preserve the food and atmosphere of the establishment. On September 26, 2011, the cafeteria closed for remodeling, planned then to last three to six months while the restaurant gets a new kitchen and a redesigned serving area. In February 2012, the remodeling process continued with the \\"unveiling\\" of the original 1904 building facade, revealed through the removal of the 1963 aluminum facade. Meieran estimated that the cafeteria would reopen in about 18 months. During renovations, a partition wall was removed, revealing a neon light that was still switched on, apparently having been lit continuously for 77 years. It may be the oldest continuously illuminated neon light in the world. The director of the Museum of Neon Art called the discovery \\"incredible\\". The revamped restaurant will have multiple eating and drinking establishments inside the building, including a bakery, a version of the original 1935 classic cafeterias on the ground and second floors, an old-school steakhouse on the third floor, and a tiki themed bar on the fourth floor, to be named \\"South Seas\\" in honor of the original 1931 facility. The combined-use building will also include a museum called \\"Clifton‚Äôs Cabinet of Curiosities\\". While restoration of Clifton‚Äôs at 648 S. Broadway has had delays, the goal of Andrew Meieran is to re-open the facility in early 2015. The restaurant finally reopened October 1, 2015. The cafeteria closed again in September 2018 for another remodel, but it remains closed as of January 2020. = Lakewood = In January 1955, it was announced that the Lakewood Center in Lakewood, California, would in 1956 become the location for the third Clifton's cafeteria. In 2001, after 44 years of service, the restaurant closed the branch due to a business slowdown. = West Covina = Eastland Shopping Center  In 1958, a Clifton's opened in West Covina, California at the Eastland Shopping Center. In 1978 Clifton's moved to the West Covina Fashion Plaza, now called Westfield West Covina, where it stayed in business until 2003.  Westfield Shopping Center  The Greenery In 1978, after moving from its original West Covina location due to an expiring lease, Clifton's relocated to inside the Westfield Shoppingtown West Covina and renamed itself \\"The Greenery\\" for its garden theme. In 2003 the branch closed, leaving \\"Clifton's Brookdale\\" at 7th and Broadway as the last of what was once an 8-store chain. = Century City = In 1965, ground was broken in Century City, California, for a 1966 opening of a new branch. The outlet operated for over 20 years before closing at the end of 1986. = Silver Spoon = In 1975, the company opened \\"Clifton's Silver Spoon\\" at 515 W. 7th Street, Los Angeles. The Marshall Lakey statue of Christ, which had been placed in storage upon closure of Pacific Seas in 1960, was returned to display when a new Garden was created in the new location. In 1997, the Silver Spoon location was closed and in 1998 the Lakey statue of Christ was relocated to The Holyland Exhibit in Los Angeles. Scenes for the Brad Pitt film Fight Club were shot in the Silver Spoon's location. = Woodland Hills = Clifton's opened a branch in Woodland Hills, California. It is also closed. = Laguna Hills = In 1987, Clifton's opened a branch in Laguna Hills, California across from the main entrance to Leisure World. For the 12 years of its operation, senior citizens accounted for 90% of the restaurant's clientele. It closed in 1999, to the dismay of local long-time patrons who frequented it as a gathering place. = Whittier = In 1971, Clifton‚Äôs opens at the Whittier Quad shopping center, offering more than 100 √† la carte menu items. The theme was Holland, and it was called The Holland House. It featured windmill murals, and a quaint ambiance reminiscent of old Holland. = San Bernardino = In 1974, Clifton's opened in San Bernardino at the Inland Center Mall.  Reception  The restaurant has made an impression on many who have visited. LA Weekly: \\"...Clifton's Cafeteria, that Depression-era palace of retroville.\\" Los Angeles Downtown News: \\"...Clifton's Cafeteria, the kitschy cool L.A. establishment that has been around since 1931\\". In Los Angeles Off the Beaten Path, author Lark Ellen Gould describes Clifton's as \\"part national park kitsch, part Disney nightmare, part Grandma's house with fake squirrels, taxidermied deer, stuffed moose, and faux waterfalls\\", and it is described by Los Angeles Times as one of the last vestiges of Old Broadway in downtown Los Angeles, with an interior that looks like a \\"slightly down-at- the-heels Disney version of a twilight forest\\". Huell Howser, host and producer of the KCET series California's Gold, featured Clifton's in one episode, where in 2001 he shared \\"Nestled in the bustling setting of historic Broadway, Clifton's Cafeteria is truly a 'jewel in the heart of the Jewelry District'\\". Howser returned in 2009, only to find little change. Benji Lanyado of The Guardian lists Clifton's as among LA's top 10 cult locations and notes that it \\"survives as an astonishing woodland fantasia\\". Michael Stern of Roadfood wrote that the surviving location of Clifton's was \\"an amazing place to eat\\", with a food line that was \\"immense\\", noting that choices included fried chicken with buttermilk biscuits, oxtail stew, turkey and dressing, and side dishes ranging from whipped or fried potatoes to 'cranberry jewel gelatin'. He wrote that for those with \\"fond memories of school lunch\\", Clifton's offers simple fare such as \\"grilled cheese sandwiches cooked crisp and pressed flat as a pancake\\". He remarked that its current location was in a part of Los Angeles that was once fashionable and wrote, \\"Once you arrive at Clifton's, though, you can feel the magic that used to be\\". The restaurant's uniqueness has also found its way into many books and novels, including The Long Embrace, Violin Dreams, Don't spit on my corner, A Few Good Women, Deep Heet!, and Remain Silent, among many others. In the novel Strange Angel, author George Pendel describes Clifton's as \\"a bizarre experience\\", and a \\"kitsch cafeteria provided millions of low-priced meals to the out-of-work and destitute during the darkest days of the depression\\", and that it provided a \\"surreal sanctuary from a broken world\\". In popular culture Science fiction author Ray Bradbury ate at Clifton's as a struggling writer, often taking advantage of the policy that anyone who couldn't afford to pay didn't have to, and in the 1930s attended meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society, which met for years at the restaurant. Author/agent/fan/collector Forrest J Ackerman later wrote, \\"...we moved to Clifton's Cafeteria, a feature of which was their free limeade and lime juice. Some of the members who didn't have more than a nickel or dime to spend guzzled a lot of that free juice.\\"Ackerman, Forrest J \\"Through Time and Space with Forry Ackerman: Part VIII\\" Mimosa 23, p. 31 Bradbury celebrated his 89th birthday at the downtown eatery in 2009.Mary MacVean Ray Bradbury still looks to the future page A1,A3 September 19, 2009 Los Angeles Times Charles Bukowski mentions Clifton's Cafeteria in his novel Ham on Rye: \\"Clifton's Cafeteria was nice. If you didn't have much money, they let you pay what you could. And if you didn't have any money, you didn't have to pay. [...] It was owned by some very nice rich old man, a very unusual person.\\"Charles Bukowski, Ham on Rye, Canongate Books, Edinburgh, 2001, p. 242 The Distillers mention Clifton's in the song \\"City of Angels\\" on the album Sing Sing Death House: \\"Emptiness never sleeps at Clifton's 6 am, with your bag lady friend and your mind descending.\\" See also * Ransom M.

It was the main house of Isaac Roosevelt's Rosedale estate on the Hudson River. His grandson, future United States president Franklin Roosevelt, spent a lot of time there as a child when it was the home of his uncle John. It was built in a late application of the Federal style, with some later Italianate touches added. In 1993 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Building The house sits on a lot on the east side of Riverview Circle, near the top of a small rise less than a mile inland from the river, visible from the house over the trees in the neighborhood. It is a two-story, five-bay clapboard-sided frame house on an exposed brick foundation. The rectangular main block has a two-story north wing, a one-story south wing, and a one-story projecting bay on the west (front) facade. Its cross-gabled roof, pierced by four chimneys, has large overhanging eaves with exposed rafters and a plain cornice supported by wooden brackets. The same treatment is found on the wing roofs as well. At the ends of the gables are round-arched windows with louvered shutters. The recessed main entrance contains a glazed wooden double French door with a molded surround and elliptical transom. All the windows on the first floor have a small cornice and shutters. A one-story flat-roofed porch wraps around the front and both sides, supported by chamfered posts. Above the entrance on the second story is a projecting bay window. It has a flat roof with the same roof treatment as the main roof. The flanking windows are similar to their first-story counterparts. The front facade is topped with a Palladian window and shutters at the attic level. The south wing has a one-story octagonal enclosed porch. The eastern (rear) facade also has a porch similar to the one on the front. The north wing has a flat-roofed projecting bay of its own at the northwest corner, and a porticoed entrance to the basement at the northeast corner. The interior retains the Federal-style center-hall plan. The adjoining rooms on either side have many of their original features such as woodwork, hardware, and mantels. History Isaac Roosevelt (1790‚Äì1863) purchased the land for his estate, in 1832, five years after his marriage. It was near his father James's estate, Mount Hope, most of which is now the grounds of the former Hudson River State Hospital. Isaac chose the name Rosedale for his own property. After his death in 1863, his son John Aspinwall Roosevelt inherited the property. He made several renovations and additions to the house, including the front porch, and is most responsible for its present appearance. His nephew Franklin, the future president, spent much time at Rosedale as a child. The property remained in the Roosevelt family until 1954, when Rosedale was subdivided to create the present suburban neighborhood around it. The house, a cottage and boathouse on the river are the only estate buildings that remain. There have been no major alterations to either.

History Since its first purchase of an IAI 1123 Westwind in 1976, the HAF Westwinds have transported the most senior government officials, both civilian and military, to many countries. The airplanes have had 3 color schemes in its history (all white in the 70s, White and Blue in the 80s, and Silver and Blue Metallic currently). The first Westwind was a 1123 model, which was later replaced by an IAI 1124 Westwind. Honduras and Panama (which has a Gulfstream IIB are the only Central American countries with presidential jet aircraft. In the mid-70's, the Honduras government bought a package of aircraft from Israel, the first lot of 12 Dassault Super Myst√®res, and 2 IAI Aravas plus an IAI 1123, which had operating limitations flying out of Toncontin International Airport (TGU), on the nation's capital, Tegucigalpa, to foreign destinations such as Washington, DC, due to lack of fuel capacity. The later IAI 1124 model, acquired in the 1980s, had enhanced performance due to more powerful and fuel efficient engines. Presidential aircraft in Honduras Honduras was the first Central American country to have a presidential aircraft; the first of these was a Beechcraft 17 single-engine aircraft supplemented with a Curtiss Condor twin-engine transport, which was followed in the late 1940s by a Douglas C-47A converted to a VIP passenger transport in the 1960s until it was replaced by the IAI 1123 Westwind in 1975 followed by the IAI 1124 Westwind in 1980. In addition to the Westwind, the Honduran president had a Sikorsky S-76 in the late 1970s, followed by an Agusta A109E Power in the late 90s and more recently a Bell 412SP In 2015 the government of Honduras buy a helicopter Bell 412EP.

It was established with the power to look into the legislative, civil, and criminal proceedings of any of the Territories, and to devise and report to the House decisions that may be necessary to secure the rights and privileges of residents and nonresidents. However in 1880 the House ruled that the committee had additional jurisdiction of all subjects relating to territorial legislation, the revision of legislation in territories, or the admission of states. Over its lifetime the committee reported legislation that affected the structure, status or power of the territorial governments, statehood, the power of municipalities, and boundary disputes. Additionally on public land in territories they had authority over railroads, public works and buildings, highways, taxes, bond issuing, education, Indian control, prohibition and wildlife.

The skin may also change color to red or orange. The disease was discovered by Abraham Buschke. Although the cause of scleredema is unknown, it is usually associated with a disease, usually diabetes, a viral illness or strep throat. It is usually not fatal, but it may cause death if the disease spreads to the internal organs. It may also cause an infection. Diagnosis The scleredema is usually proposed as a diagnosis based on the appearance of the skin and the patient's medical history. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor performs a skin biopsy, in which hematoxylin and eosin staining will show a thick reticular dermis with thick collagen bundles separated by clear spaces. The patient's blood may be examined for diseases that may appear after the onset of symptoms, such as multiple myeloma. Treatment Although many types of medications have been tried as treatments, none of them have been proven effective in treating scleredema. Those treatments, such as corticosteroids, may benefit the patient, but will not cure their condition. If the affected area is infected, it is usually treated immediately. The symptoms of the condition usually resolve within six months to two years after onset. However, patients whose condition was associated to diabetes may suffer for longer periods of time. Myocarditis resulting as a complication from the disease has been successfully treated with penicillin and steroids.

At the age of twenty-one, Cusack became the manager and owner of the Canton Bulldogs, one of the leading teams of the day. During his six years with the Canton Bulldogs, Cusack led the team to Ohio League championships, in 1916 and 1917, and was responsible for bringing Jim Thorpe into professional football. Cusack also is responsible for helping revive the Bulldogs following the Canton Bulldogs-Massillon Tigers Betting Scandal, which eroded public support for the game from 1906 until 1911. He also ensured that the Bulldogs had a sturdy financial foundation for when they would later enter the National Football League. In 1918, Cusack left football to enter the oil and gasoline business in Oklahoma. He later worked as an independent oil operator in Fort Worth, Texas. Early life and the Bulldogs betting scandal Cusack developed a love for professional football during the early days of the Canton Bulldogs franchise, then headed up by Blondy Wallace. In 1906 though the Bulldogs were accused of throwing a game to rival Massillon Tigers. Making one of the earliest accusations was Victor Kaufmann, who had lost a heavy bet on the disputed contest. Right after the Bulldogs returned to Canton, the day of the 13-6 loss to Massillion, Kaufmann and Cusack went to the Courtland Hotel Bar, where most of the Bulldogs had congregated to post- mortem the game. There a fight broke out after Kaufman accused the Bulldogs of throwing the game. The fight engulfed the whole bar and police had to be called in. Kauffman and Cusack escaped the bar, before the police showed up. In his book, \\"A Pioneer in Pro Football\\", Cusack still believed, years later, that the Bulldogs and Wallace threw the game. Pro football A Canton team was organized in 1912, with all games held at League Park, owned by Ed Piero and Dr. Lothamer. The new organization was called the Canton Professionals for fears that the old Bulldog name would bring back memories of the 1906 scandal. In 1912 this time, at the age of 21, Cusack became the team's secretary- treasurer, at no cost to the team, as a favor to Roscoe Oberlin. However Cusack was disliked by the current Professionals manager H.H. Halter. Cusack later went behind Halter's back to sign a contract with Peggy Parrett's Akron Indians, concerning conditions for a match between the two squads, something Halter was unable to do. When Jack's actions were discovered by Halter, he tried to dispose of Jack's services through a team meeting. However during the meeting the team sided Cusack, after discovering that he had secured a 5-year lease on League Park for the Pros. The result was Halter being removed from the team, and Jack being named the team's new manager. As manager of the Pros, Cusack slowly added star college players to his roster along with the local sandlotters who constituted the bulk of the team. To make the team more profitable he had 1,500 seats added to League Park. Also Jack felt that the Pros had to live down the 1906 scandal and gain the public's confidence in the honesty of the game. It was his theory that if he could stop players from jumping from one team to another, it would be a first step in the right direction. Therefore, the managers made a verbal agreement that once a player signed with a team he was that team's property as long as he played, or until he was released by management. Finally Cusack revived the Canton-Massillon rivalry in 1915. With the rivalry, fans began referring to Canton as the \\"Bulldogs\\" again. Soon afterwards Cusack reinstated the team's former name. Signing Thorpe Just before Canton's first game with the newly revived Massillon Tigers, Cusack signing the Jim Thorpe, the Sac and Fox Indian from Oklahoma who was then rated as the world's greatest football player, and all- around athlete. He had Thorpe under contract to play for Canton for $250 a game. Thorpe ended up being a huge draw for Canton bringing record numbers of fans to the games. Canton lost the first game to the Tigers 16-0, however they won the second game 6-0. Under Cusack the Bulldogs won the 1916 and 1917 Ohio League Championships. Even with World War I taking place, Canton still had a tough team. However with more players going into the armed forces, football came to a halt until after the Armistice, in November 1918. Oil Business After leaving high school in 1907, Jack went to work as an office employee for the East Ohio Gas Company, a subsidiary of the Standard Oil. When professional football took a hiatus for World War I. Jack returned to the oil business in Oklahoma. In the spring of 1919 he received a letter from Ralph Hay stating that he would like to carry on with the team if he was not returning. Ralph, who was a very good friend of both Thorpe and Jack, was acquainted with most of our 1916 and 1917 players, and therefore was in position to organize a team from that foundation. Jack decided to let Hay go ahead rather than withdraw from his oil operations. he transferred the lease on League Park to Hay. Back to football In 1921, Cusack left Arkansas, after contracting malaria, for Canton. There met up with Thorpe, who was now playing for the Cleveland Tigers. He hired Cusack to look after his personnel affairs as he felt that he was not receiving his full amount of gate money owed to him. He later found out that when Cleveland played in a baseball venue, the stadium personnel would take a larger cut for themselves and leave the rest for the players. He also found out that over 800-900 complimentary tickets were given out per contest, far above the allowable amount. Cusack soon found himself collecting all of the monies due to every Tigers player. Even when the treasurer of the Tigers tried to run off with over $3,750 owed to the team, Cusack and Thorpe tracked him down and returned the money to the players. He soon became the manager for the Tigers for two games before quitting in 1922. Cusack later became an independent oil operator living in Fort Worth, Texas.

However, the remaining unaired episodes were burned off Saturdays at 8:00 pm (EST).http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/05/22/cbs-revives-three-rivers- for-saturdays-starting-june-5/8706/ Development With the long running NBC drama ER coming to an end, CBS executives put out a call for a new medical show to fill the void. Carol Barbee was introduced via Curtis Hanson to a pitch by Steve Boman, a former transplant coordinator and Chicago newspaper reporter, for a drama about a transplant hospital. Barbee decided to undertake the project telling it from three points of view of the donor, recipient, and doctor. The location for the show's setting in Pittsburgh was decided based on a determination that the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) was the world's leading transplant center with the coincidence that the dominant topographical feature of the city, the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers, would provide an allegory to the show's three points of view. Barbee did her research for the show at The Cleveland Clinic with Dr. Gonzalo Gonzalez-Stawinski, who also tutored the show's lead star Alex O'Loughlin. Dr. Robert Kormos, co-director of heart transplantation at UPMC, also provided input. Transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl, who visited the set, is the inspiration for the fictional transplant pioneer who is revealed to be the father of character Dr. Miranda Foster. The pilot for the Pittsburgh-set medical drama was filmed in western Pennsylvania in March and April 2009, using the closed Brownsville Tri-County Hospital and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center for hospital interior scenes. Post-pilot recasting resulted in actors Julia Ormond and Joaquim de Almeida departing and Alfre Woodard and Amber Clayton joining the series.\\"Recasting Season Claims Its Latest Victim: Julia Ormond\\", New York Magazine, 2009-05-28\\"Alfre Woodard joins 'Three Rivers'\\", The Hollywood Reporter, 2009-07-28 Ultimately, the pilot was dropped, and a new episode was shot for the television premiere. A high-tech, more visually appealing hospital set for the ER and ICU was built on soundstages 19 and 20 at Paramount Pictures where interior scenes have thereafter been produced, although location shooting still occurred in Pittsburgh for exterior shots.

Life and times Jos√© Nicol√°s Matienzo was born in San Miguel de Tucum√°n, Argentina, in 1860. He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires Law School, where he was mentored by Professor Jos√© Manuel Estrada, graduating with a juris doctor in 1882. The mercurial student began contributing articles and columns on a variety of subjects during law school, and continued in subsequent years. He was first appointed to public service as Legal Advisor to the Ministry of Public Works of Buenos Aires, in 1885. This experience earned him a seat on Emilio Mitre's Railroad Regulatory Commission, which contributed to the orderly and rapid development of rail transport in Argentina, after 1889. He then served as a civil court judge in La Plata, until 1890. Maienzo had supported the paramount National Autonomist Party; but became disenchanted with it during President Miguel Ju√°rez Celman's despotic 1886-90 rule. He provided legal advice to reform activists following the violently-suppressed Revolution of the Park (1890). Following a term in the Senate of the Province of Buenos Aires, during which he became well known for his defense of federalism, Matienzo returned to the University of Buenos Aires in 1904 as Professor of Philosophy and Letters. He was appointed dean of his school in 1906, and later established the Institute of Historical Research. The reformist President Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta appointed Matienzo Minister of Labor in 1907. Accepting the post during a period of upheaval in the Argentine labor movement, he committed the bureau to accelerated labor law reform and ordered the publication of a bulletin detailing its activities. Continuing to teach he wrote the seminal Federal Representative Government in the Argentine Republic, in 1910. The text articulated his view as historian that Argentine politics would shift along roughly 18-year cycles and that reform could only evolve as quickly as the educational level of the public at large. He was later appointed Attorney General by the first democratically elected President of Argentina, Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen. The president retained him during his entire 1916-22 term, though Matienzo developed differences with the increasingly autocratic Yrigoyen. This helped earn him the powerful post of Minister of the Interior (overseeing law enforcement) under Yrigoyen's successor, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, who removed almost all other high-level Yrigoyen appointees. Matienzo retired from his professorship in 1927, when he accepted Socialist Party leader Juan B. Justo's invitation to join his ticket as a running mate. The decision to include the pragmatic Matienzo sparked a division in the party during their 1927 convention, however. Three months before the April 1928 election, Justo died unexpectedly, and Matienzo fared poorly. In 1932 the aging academic was elected to the Argentine Senate from his native Province of Tucum√°n, and he remained there until his death in 1936, at age 75.

He was the eldest son of Duke Bolko I of Opole by his wife Agnes, probably a daughter of Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. Boles≈Çaw was nicknamed \\"the Elder\\" or \\"First-born\\" (Pierworodny) in order to distinguish him from his younger brother, who, for unknown reasons, was also named Boles≈Çaw (Bolko). Life After his father's death in 1313, Boles≈Çaw inherited the Duchies of Wielu≈Ñ and Niemodlin. Until 1323, he exercised the guardianship on behalf of his younger brothers, then too youngs for rule by their own. His political career was strongly connected with the House of Luxembourg, rulers of Bohemia. This alliance with the Bohemian Kingdom caused a war between him and W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, which ended with the loss of Wielu≈Ñ in 1326. On 18 February 1327, together with the other Silesian Dukes, Boles≈Çaw paid homage to King John of Bohemia in Opawa. One year later (in 1328) in order to fulfill his new responsibilities as vassal of Bohemian, he took part in the Crusade against the pagan Lithuania. After returning from this expedition, Boles≈Çaw follow his sovereign to Prague, where he spent much time. In 1336, as a reward for his faithful services, the King authorized Boles≈Çaw to buy the town of Prudnik with the surroundings villages by the amount of 2,000 fines. In 1355 Boles≈Çaw took part in the trip of King Charles of Bohemia to Rome, where the latter was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Boles≈Çaw died between 1362 and 1365. His place of burial is unknown.

Makuta drums are tall cylindrical or barrel-shaped Afro-Cuban drums, often cited as an important influence on the development of the tumbadora or conga drum. They are used in sacred dance-drumming ceremonies associated with the descendants of slaves brought to Cuba from Central Africa. The word makuta is also used to refer to the dancing and rhythms associated with these drums.  Construction  Makuta drum construction has a number of regional variations, but the ensemble usually consists of only two drums. Generally, all are created from wooden staves, similar to the way a barrel would be constructed. Both sizes have a goat skin head at the top of the drum and are open on the opposite end. They are commonly around 1 meter in height and their heads vary from approximately 30 cm to 40 cm in diameter. The large lead drum is known variously as caja, nsumbi, or ngoma and is usually barrel shaped. Its head is attached with a tensioning system of metal rods, usually known in English as ‚Äúlugs.‚Äù The smaller drum known as segundo, salidor, or kundiabata, is cylindrical and has the skin attached with tacks, thus requiring it to be tuned by a flame or other heat source. The researcher Fernando Ortiz was told by interviewees that a cord-tensioning system was used prior to metal lugs, and this system was more recently documented in other regions by the Cuban music research institute known as CIDMUC (see references below). Makuta drums are often adorned with painted symbols of the cabildo to which they belong, or even Cuban national symbols. They are played while standing and are sometimes attached to the player with a rope around the waist in order to lean the drum slightly forward. Both drums are played with the hands and the lead drummer sometimes wears shakers on his wrists, a practice also common in yuka and rumba drumming.  History  Makuta drums are associated with Cuban cabildos that claim Bantu or Congo ancestry (i.e., from Central Africa). There is some uncertainty as to whether or not these drums were historically played in ensembles of three, or if that was a more recent and infrequent addition. Makuta drumming is practiced mostly in the Western provinces of Cuba including Havana and Matanzas. The oldest surviving drums are said to be found in the provinces of Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, and Sancti Sp√≠ritus.  Social function  Though the rhythms used in makuta vary from place to place, makuta is always a dance-drumming event with sacred significance. The functions of its African antecedents, however, are said to be more ceremonial, possibly to accompany the coronation of kings in the Congo.Betancourt:40 In Cuba, makuta activities are associated with Congo cabildos and have been called ‚Äúpublic religious music‚Äù,Ortiz:432 a reference to its openness compared to other Congo religious practices in Cuba such as Palo. In the instances that they are used for funeral ceremonies, they can be accompanied by the kinfuiti drum, a friction drum similar to the Brazilian cuica but larger. Though historically only practiced in cabildos, after the Cuban revolution a number of Afro-Cuban folkloric groups began to perform makuta for staged performances, recordings, and tourists. Such groups, such as Conjunto Folkl√≥rico Nacional de Cuba and Grupo Afrocuba de Matanzas, make use of tumbadoras instead of actual makuta drums.  References  * Neira Betancourt, Lino (2005).

The dean of Religious Education serves as the RSC's director, and an associate dean oversees the two branches of the RSC: research and publications. History The RSC (sometimes called the Center for Religious Studies in its early years) was founded in 1975 by Jeffrey R. Holland, dean of Religious Education at BYU. Upon the recommendation of List of presidents of Brigham Young University}BYU president Dallin H. Oaks, the establishment of the RSC was approved by BYU's Board of Trustees in early 1976. Holland became the RSC's first director, with Keith H. Meservy, assistant professor of ancient scripture, as administrator. In 1976, Holland was appointed Commissioner of Church Education, and Ellis T. Rasmussen replaced him as dean of Religious Instruction and general director of the RSC.Rasmussen served as dean from 1976-81. See: The Religious Education dean is also the RSC general director. For Rasmussen, see: The RSC brought together several earlier BYU institutions. It became the home of the Richard L. Evans Chair of Christian Understanding, which had been founded in 1973 with Truman G. Madsen as its first occupant. Madsen became a professor emeritus in 1994, and the position was renamed the Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding, reflecting the hope that holders would extend the hand of friendship to all people, not just Christians. The RSC also assumed and expanded upon the activities of the Institute of Mormon Studies, which was founded to study Mormon history and doctrine under Daniel H. Ludlow in 1961 and Madsen in 1966. Likewise, the RSC absorbed the Book of Mormon Institute, a center for research on the Book of Mormon, with Ludlow as its first director in 1965, followed by Paul R. Cheesman in 1968. In September 1985, at the request of Holland, then BYU's president, the RSC began holding annual symposia on the Book of Mormon. The first of these was organized by Paul R. Cheesman, who also edited the published compilation of papers from that event. Each symposium successively covered following sections of the book until 1994, when papers on the entire book had been published in nine anthology volumes in the Book of Mormon Symposium Series. The faculty publications directors have consisted of S. Kent Brown (19851987), Charles D. Tate Jr. (19871994), Kent P. Jackson (19942001), Richard D. Draper (20012004), Richard N. Holzapfel (20042010), Robert L. Millet (20102012), Dana M. Pike (20122013), Thomas A. Wayment (20132018), and Scott C. Esplin (2018present). All have significantly influenced the nature and quality of the academic books and journal articles published. In 2001, the dean of Religious Education, Andrew C. Skinner, asked Richard D. Draper to reorganize the center with Holzapfel as editor of the new Religious Educator journal and Devan Jensen as executive editor to professionalize the publications. The RSC created a new advisory board with male and female members from diverse backgrounds with interest in ancient scripture and modern history and doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Draper negotiated a partnership with Covenant Communications to publish RSC materials; that partnership lasted about five years. The Religious Educator relied on copyediting by Ted D. Stoddard with design work by Stephen Hales Creative, based in Provo, Utah. Holzapfel started a project to digitize past RSC content; initiated translation of selected articles into Spanish, Portuguese, and German; and launched the BYU Religious Education Review magazine. Purpose Believing church leaders, not scholars, are the ultimate doctrinal authority, the RSC seeks to only add historical, cultural, and linguistic context and to explore new views of the LDS religious tradition. The RSC coordinates and publishes this research in the hopes of growing the body of LDS literature and thought. In 1977, as Church Commissioner of Education, Holland told the center that he hoped it would bring dialogue with other cultures and religions, leading to greater understanding, brotherhood, and peace. Later, as president of BYU in 1986, Holland recalled that the RSC was established to inform those within the university and the general LDS membership. In 2008, the RSC began posting its complete library in English and selections in Spanish and Portuguese in order to increase its worldwide presence.http://rsc.byu.edu/ ActivitiesAreas of study= The RSC has funded research in several areas, including ancient scripture, ancient studies, the Bible, the Book of Mormon, Church history, the Doctrine and Covenants, Judeo-Christian Religions, the Pearl of Great Price, and world religions. The RSC has also sponsored LDS sociological studies and research on other religions, such as early Egyptian Christianity, Islam, and sub-tropical African religions. In 1985, the RSC began to publish works from some of these specialized areas of study, making up the RSC Specialized Monograph Series. =Research and funding= The RSC awards financial grants to BYU faculty and other scholars for research into LDS history, doctrine, scripture, and culture. This research has been published by the RSC and other publishers, including Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought,Marie Cornwall's work on the article \\"How Common the Principle?: Women as Plural Wives in 1860\\" was partially funded by the RSC. See: the University of Illinois Press, the University of Missouri Press, and Oxford University Press. Of the several projects it accepts per year, the RSC prefers those that benefit religious teachers and the progress of the LDS Church. RSC publications are intended to be scholarly and useful to general LDS readers. The RSC is financed through BYU funds, individual donations, and the Friends of Religious Education (FORE). FORE is a national volunteer committee to find donors for BYU Religious Education activities, such as RSC research, publishing, and translation. FORE encourages donations, sponsors projects, and hosts firesides (special religious lectures) throughout the United States given by Religious Education faculty. =Books= The following titles show the breadth of books published by the RSC (complete list): Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, eds., The Words of Joseph Smith; Hugh W. Nibley, Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless; Kenneth L. Alford, ed., Civil War Saints; Roger P. Minert, In Harm's Way: East German Latter-day Saints in World War II; Mark L. Grover, A Land of Promise and Prophecy: Elder A. Theodore Tuttle in South America, 1960‚Äì1965; Laura Harris Hales, ed., A Reason for Faith: Navigating LDS Doctrine and Church History; and Michael Hubbard MacKay and Nicholas J. Frederick, Joseph Smith's Seer Stones. Several have won awards (see list below). =Symposia and Conferences= A primary function of the RSC is the organization of symposia and conferences on religious subjects, from which selected papers are later published. Anthologies from symposia on broad topics make up several volumes in the RSC Monograph Series. Some of these symposia recur annually, such as ones on scriptures and church history. The RSC is also involved with the annual Sidney B. Sperry Symposium, which have been held at BYU since 1973. Often, general authorities deliver the keynote addresses at these symposia. In 2003 the Religious Education Administrative Council approved a proposal by Richard Neitzel Holzapfel and Thomas A. Wayment to host a conference on the Saturday before Easter which would focus on Jesus's last twenty-four hours and Resurrection. The conference was held and rebroadcast on KBYU Television, helping Religious Education expand its audience. The response to this conference, now called the BYU Easter Conference, was so positive that the university decided it should be an annual event, cosponsored by Religious Education and the RSC. Early on, nearly one thousand attendees heard Elder D. Todd Christofferson give the keynote address at the second annual conference, \\"The Atonement and the Resurrection,\\" later published in the Religious Educator. In subsequent years, the event was shifted to Fridays, often targeted to coincide with Good Friday. Over the years keynote addresses were delivered by President Cecil O. Samuelson in 2006, Elder F. Enzio Busche in 2007, and Sister Bonnie D. Parkin in 2009. An estimated 2,500 people attended the 2013 Easter Conference that featured Elder John M. Madsen, Brad Wilcox, and Brent L. Top. Other well-known keynote addresses have been given by Elaine S. Dalton, Spencer J. Condie, Sheri L. Dew, and BYU president, Kevin J Worthen.https://rsc.byu.edu/easterconference The annual event has stayed quite popular among people living along the Wasatch Front. The proceedings are published every other year by the RSC in cooperation with Deseret Book. In 2006 the RSC began sponsoring the Church History Symposium, copublishing the proceedings with Deseret Book. Professor Alexander L. Baugh initiated the event by proposing a conference to acknowledge the two hundredth anniversary of Oliver Cowdery's birth. Since that time, this event has become a premier venue for rigorous and faithful scholarship on Church history. The topics have been Oliver Cowdery, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, \\"Preserving the History of the Latter-day Saints,\\" \\"A Firm Foundation: Church Organization and Administration,\\" \\"Go Ye into All the World: The Growth and Development of Mormon Missionary Work,\\" \\"Joseph F. Smith: Reflections on the Man and His Times,\\" \\"Approaching Antiquity: Joseph Smith's Study of the Ancient World,\\" \\"The International Church: Mormonism as a Global Religion,\\" \\"Beyond Biography: Sources in Context for Mormon Women's History,\\" and \\"Financing Faith: The Intersection of Business and Religion.\\" =Periodicals= In addition to books and articles, the RSC publishes its own periodicals. In 1986 the RSC began publishing the quarterly (later triannual) Religious Studies Center Newsletter, which carried updates on RSC symposia, books, and research, and was distributed to Church Educational System faculty and LDS military chaplains. In 2008 the newsletter was replaced by BYU Religious Education Review, a semiannual magazine. In 2000, Dean Robert L. Millet and others created the Religious Educator journal to focus on \\"teaching the gospel, publishing studies on scripture, doctrine, and LDS Church history, and sharing the messages of outstanding devotional essays.\\"Religious Educator 1 (2000): i. Millet replaced the temporary editorial board in 2001 with Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, who became the full-time editor in chief. Holzapfel asked Ted D. Stoddard, a professor in the Marriott School of Business, to explore design and content issues and prepare guidelines that would enhance the scholarly basis of this new publication. Holzapfel clarified the purpose of this new venture: \\"Our hope is to provide readers with carefully prepared, inspirational, and information-packed writings on a wide range of subjects explicitly associated with the Restoration. Teachers, authors, researchers, and students of Latter-day Saint studies at every level will appreciate discussions of relevant ideas and issues from a perspective of faith.\\"Religious Educator 3, no. 2 (2002): vi The main audience consists of Church Educational System teachers, such as volunteers and paid professionals in LDS Seminaries and Institutes of Religion and religion professors at church colleges. In 2007 the RSC agreed to oversee and help fund the student journal Studia Antiqua. =Awards= *2019: Best International Book Award (Mormon History Association) for James A.

It opened on 13 July 1903 as the first direct railway link between the two towns and was constructed by the Great Eastern Railway and the Midland and Great Northern Railway in the hope of encouraging the development of holiday resorts along the coast. In the event, although the line was built to high standards and considerable cost, intermediate traffic did not develop and competition from buses and trams eroded the little that had been generated. Fish traffic was carried in large quantities until the 1930s when it fell into decline. In 1953, when major repairs to the Breydon Viaduct were required, it was decided to discontinue through services from the Midland and Great Northern to Lowestoft and to divert London trains to Lowestoft via Norwich. After the Midland and Great Northern and Yarmouth‚ÄìBeccles line closed to passengers in 1959, the Yarmouth‚ÄìLowestoft line was upgraded to accommodate the diverted traffic, but after services were switched to in 1962, it was singled and the stations made unstaffed halts. With only a local service running between vandalised stations, the decision was taken to close the route on 4 May 1970 in favour of bus services which were judged adequate for most of the year.  History  Construction = The Great Eastern Railway and the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway formed the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Committee in July 1898 to control as a joint railway projected extensions between and as well as Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The second line would create the first direct coastal link between the Norfolk and Suffolk coastal towns, and the railway companies also hoped that it would stimulate the development of holiday resorts along the coast. It opened on 13 July 1903 and immediately supplanted the more circuitous route between the two towns provided by the Yarmouth‚ÄìBeccles line via the Haddiscoe East curve and St Olaves station. Breydon Viaduct over Breydon Water. As part of the agreement, the GER would build a direct line between Yarmouth and Lowestoft, while the M&GN; would construct a link from Caister Road near its Yarmouth Beach terminus across the Wherry Lines and the Beccles line to a junction near Gorleston North station. The scheme to construct the M&GN; link was entitled the Lowestoft Junction Railway and entailed the construction of three viaducts: Breydon Viaduct over Breydon Water, a smaller viaduct across the River Bure and the Vauxhall Viaduct across the GER's East Suffolk line. In total, ¬£159,758-12-4d (equivalent to ¬£ in ) was spent in constructing , not taking account of the costs of alterations made to Yarmouth Beach station to accommodate the new connection. The track was at first double but became single for the Breydon Viaduct, now the most important engineering structure on the M&GN;, before becoming double again to join the GER curve from Yarmouth South Town station at Gorleston North Junction. The contractors for the line were Oliver & Sons of Rugby, and John Wilson from the GER was appointed as engineer. = Operations = Passenger traffic  A 1912 Railway Clearing House map showing the coastal section of the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway (in dotted blue/yellow) and connecting lines. As the Joint Committee had no rolling stock of its own, services between Yarmouth and Lowestoft or either and Beccles typically consisted of two coaches hauled by a small tank locomotive such as the M&GN; 4-4-2Ts. The M&GN; initially ran four daily services to and from Lowestoft, while the GER laid on three trains; the M&GN; used Yarmouth Beach and the GER South Town. The GER services were withdrawn during the First World War. The M&GN; also operated two holiday expresses: a morning service to Leicester and Birmingham and an afternoon one to Derby, Manchester and Liverpool. Neither called at or Corton stations. Consequently, although and Gorleston North stations received around 10,000 passengers between them and Lowestoft Central around 25,000 passengers during the pre-First World War period, Hopton and Corton saw little traffic. In fact, Corton station had less than 10,000 passengers during 1911, which corresponded to less than half a passenger for each M&GN; stopping service. There were no Sunday passenger services except during Summer, although a to Yarmouth service in October did run until 1905 for the benefit of daytrippers. Between January 1917 and July 1919, all GER services were withdrawn between Yarmouth South Town and Lowestoft Central as a First World War economy measure. Although the M&GN; remained a joint line after the 1923 railway grouping, it was now operated by the London Midland and Scottish Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway. The same year, the LMS introduced a new service which connected and with Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The journey time between Manchester and Yarmouth was 6 hours 25 minutes. A variety of Great Eastern, Great Northern and Great Central tanks were used to provide a regular but poorly-patronised service. During the Second World War, single line working was introduced between Gorleston-on-Sea and Lowestoft North as the other line was needed to store wagons; normal service was restored in March 1948. Gorleston North was so badly damaged by enemy bombing that it was subsequently closed; the station was inconveniently sited in relation to the town and had suffered from bus and tram competition. The post- war timetable gave the line its poorest level of service than at any previous point: four trains ran from South Town and two from Yarmouth Beach. At this time, a two-coach unit was suitable for most workings except Summer Saturdays. Holiday excursions returned after the war and M&GN; services to the East Midlands and Birmingham were popular. . The 1951 summer timetable BR(E) timetable from 15 June 1951 showed 14 trains MON-FRI (6 from Yarmouth Beach, 8 from South Town) and 19 on Saturday (10 from Yarmouth Beach or beyond and 9 from South Town) at irregular times. After the closure of the M&GN; and the introduction of DMUs the Winter 1957-58 timetable showed 15 hourly departures from South Town between 7.29am and 9.29pm, rising to 20 in 1963-64 after the closure of the line to Beccles. By the final winter of 1969-70, this number had fallen to 12.  Goods traffic  The line did initially deal with substantial goods traffic: nearly 20,000 tons of coal a year and 5,000 tons annually of Lowestoft fish traffic, around 10% of the total generated. and Gorleston North stations became important coal depots, while potential for new traffic was created by the construction of a sugar beet shoot at Hopton-on-Sea in 1913. In the same year, a new 12-coach spur was installed at Gorleston-on- Sea to accommodate passengers for the Suffolk Show. A new station was opened at in 1914 to serve the adjacent golf club which paid the costs of construction. Fish traffic declined during the First World War, but overall goods traffic increased as a result of war requirements and the diversion to rail of traditionally seaborne traffic to Yarmouth, Lynn and Wisbech. The volume of goods carried by rail declined significantly in the post-war period due to agricultural and industrial depression, coupled with the growth of road competition to which the line was vulnerable due to the short distances over which traffic was conveyed. Between 1923 and 1936 the M&GN; provided the goods service over the line which consisted of two or three trains per day together with fish trains. The denationalisation of road transport by the Transport Act 1953 dealt a further blow to goods traffic by facilitating long-distance transportation by motor vehicles.  Decline and closure  Both the M&GN; and Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Committee were transferred to the British Transport Commission upon nationalisation in 1948. They were assigned to the Eastern Region of British Railways which corresponded very much to the southern region of the LNER. Reliance on summer traffic was not enough and a programme of closures and economies was put into action from 1953 with the closure of the first section of the Norfolk and Suffolk between Cromer and Mundesley, followed by the closure of Breydon Viaduct from 21 September due to the costs of maintenance. This resulted in the withdrawal of Lowestoft coaches on the expresses from Leicester, the M&GN; freight trains and the ordinary passenger service between Yarmouth Beach and Lowestoft. A service between the coastal towns was maintained from South Town, as was a through service to Lowestoft from Birmingham on Saturdays; the Leicester service was reintroduced the following summer, running from Derby to Gorleston and Lowestoft via the Beccles line. Passenger services on the M&GN; were the next to be withdrawn in February 1959, followed by those on the Yarmouth to Beccles line. This led to the re-routing of London to Yarmouth expresses via Lowestoft where they reversed and ran along the coast to Yarmouth South Town. This avoided the division of trains at Beccles and also provided Gorleston holidaymakers with a direct link to London; it also served the camps and caravan parks at Hopton and Corton. At this time there were expectations that the line would become the main London to Yarmouth route and in preparation for the additional traffic bridges were strengthened and track improved. However, following improvements to Yarmouth Vauxhall station and dieselisation in 1962, the bulk of the London service was re-routed via Norwich Thorpe and the Wherry Lines. There was still however enough holiday traffic in 1964 to justify nine services to and from South Town from on Saturdays. This declined in the face of the rationalisations and elimination of surplus rolling stock recommended by the Beeching Report which had the effect of greatly reducing the number of Saturday specials. From September 1966, the line ‚Äì which had long been plagued by an imbalance between summer and winter patronage ‚Äì saw the introduction of diesel sets with conductor guards. In reality, this was no more than a pay train serving weed-infested and vandalised stations. The stations at Gorleston-on-Sea, Hopton, Corton and Lowestoft North were also made unstaffed. In the following year the line was singled and the daily goods pick-up at Lowestoft Central and Yarmouth South Town was discontinued. The last Norfolk and Suffolk signal box at Lowestoft North was also closed, those at Gorleston, Hopton and Corton having already been switched out. By this time, the line was losing ¬£34,000 a year (equivalent to ¬£ in ) and with no through services served only local interests. In the absence of any realistic prospect of traffic improvement, closure came on 4 May 1970. An attempt was made by a local group to purchase the line with a view to running year-round commuter services and summer steam-hauled tourist trains, but this came to nothing.  Present day  A47 relief road. The site of Yarmouth South Town has disappeared beneath new roads, superstores and industrial units, whilst that of Gorleston-on-Sea was swept away in 1991 to make way for a roundabout on the A47 Gorleston inner relief road. The road follows the former railway alignment from the bridge at Yarmouth Vauxhall to a point to the south of the former Gorleston station, and includes a new drawbridge near the site of Breydon Viaduct. The site of Gorleston Links Halt is similarly unrecognisable and have disappeared under residential development. A housing estate has been built across the track at the site of Hopton-on-Sea station; the stationmaster's house still stands as do the gates to the goods yard to the right of the house. Corton is the only former station on the line still standing; it is in use as a private residence, although the platform canopy is very rundown. Lowestoft North has disappeared under residential development and a road named \\"Beeching Drive\\" occupies the former alignment; to the west a section of the line has become a non-vehicular right of way. The absence of a direct rail connection between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft remains keenly felt today.

It is an ectoparasite of fish which infests the gills. It is problematic on fish farms. It is otherwise non-hazardous to humans. Characteristics D. vastator is just over 1.25 millimeters long. It has two pairs of hooks known as hamuli, one on the lower surface of the worm, and a larger set at the rear. It has three pairs of sticky sacs and four eyespots.Monogeneans: Monogenea - No Common Name (Dactylogyrus vastator): Species Accounts Distribution D. vastator lives in the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Significance The flatworm causes mass mortality among fingerling carp in fish-rearing ponds. Abnormal multiplication of cells in the gill epithelium interferes with carp's respiratory functions. The parasite is especially significant in the former Soviet Union, eastern and northern Europe,http://www.answers.com/topic/dactylogyrus-vastator India, and Sri Lanka, where carp are bred for food. Life cycle Dactylogyrus vastator has one host and no intermediate hosts. New hosts are located and infected by free-living larvae (oncomiracidium). D. vastator lives in the gills of carp species, including goldfish. The adult lays eggs on the gill filaments which are then washed out of the gill cavity and into the water. A ciliated oncomiracidium emerges from the egg in 3‚Äì5 days, depending on water temperature. In warmer temperatures the embryo develops more rapidly. The larva emerges, leaving the embryonic membrane inside the egg. The larva is drawn into the gill cavity of a host fish, where it attaches by its hooks. The larva can also swim actively and attach to the skin of the host and migrate to the gills. The larva reaches sexual maturity about ten days later.Animal Parasites Their Life Cycles and Ecology Summer is the season of peak infestation, and by fall the worms are scarce. Eggs released late in the season enter diapause, a period of inactivity. When the water warms the following spring the eggs develop. Young carp are more often infested, sometimes fatally when large numbers of worms attach to the gill filaments. Superinfection can occur during the summer when the worms are most abundant.

History Amos was located in the Rhodian Peraia in Caria on the Mediterranean coast. It was probably connected with Lindos which is supported by epigraphic finds from that city.P. M. Fraser & G. E. Bean, The Rhodian Peraea and Islands, London 1954. Its connection to the poleis of Rhodes is further attested by the use of the Doric dialect in the inscriptions found at the settlement.Richard Stillwell et al. eds. (1976), The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. Amos was in the 5th century incorporated in the Delian league together with the other Rhodian areas, and is noted in the Athenian tributes lists as belonging to the community of the kherronƒìsioi (\\"the people of the peninsula\\"). The Loryma peninsula is the most probable candidate for this peninsula; the other members of this community are unknown. At some point during this period, Amos and the other two members of the kherronƒìsioi formed an economic union (œÉœÖŒΩœÑŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπŒ±, synteleia) in order to pay their tributes. The members of this synteleia must have incorporated the majority of the Loryma peninsula. It is known from a set of three inscriptions (SEG 14.683; 14.684; 14.685) that Amos in ca. 200 B.C.E. had a board of hieromnamones, \\"sacred rememberers\\" that were responsible for keeping and remembering legal agreements and other juridical proceedings.Michael Gagarin (2008),Writing Greek law, p.117. The inhabitants of the Rhodian Peraia, and thus Amos as well, were full Rhodian citizens. It seems however as the amians, being of Lindian descent, held no citizenship at Lindos. The inscriptions mentioned above indicate that the city (ha polis, that is, Rhodes) had the right to evict tenants and charge fines, showing that the polis had strong interests in the area. Remains Hellenistic tower of ancient Amos.Tomb at the necropolis.The remnants of ancient Amos is centered on the elongated hill of Asarcƒ±k at Hisarburnu (\\"fortress point\\"), just above the gulf of Marmaris. The city wall is made of coursed polygonal masonry dated to the Hellenistic period, and is fairly well preserved on the north slope where walls and towers still stand 3‚Äì4 metres high. The wall on the south reach has almost disappeared due to erosion. Five towers are preserved, all of which are solid except for one. There is one gate in the northern wall, which is probably the main city gate. On the basis of the type of masonry used, the construction of the original wall has been dated to the 4th century B.C.E.A. W. McNicoll, Hellenistic fortifications from the Aegean to the Euphrates, Oxford 1997.T. Saner, \\"Observations on the different types of masonry used in the city walls of Amos\\", R√âA 96, 1994, 273-284. Of the intra muros remains, the theatre is the most apparent. Of the three known Greek theatres of the Rhodian Peraia, the Amos theatre is the only one with preserved remnants of the skƒìnƒì and the orchestra. The approximate number of possible spectators is estimated to around 1300. G. E. Bean found in 1948 a fragmentary altar to Dionysos in the area of the orchestra. On the top of the hill, just west of the theatre, several fragments of an Hellenistic circular or semi-circular statue base is to be seen.A. Maiuri, 'Viaggio di esplorazione in Caria', Annuario della Scuola archeologica di Atene e delle Missioni italiane in Oriente, 4-5 (1921-1922, 415-419). Further to the west, close to the ramparts, are the foundations of a small temple in antis with a pronaos, 6.8 m wide and 13.8 m long. Inscriptions with a temple inventory found in the vicinity show that the temple was probably dedicated to Apollo Samnaios (\\"Apollo-of-the-hill\\"), a deity only known from this location. The necropolis is located just outside the city proper, north of the city walls. Several rock-cut tombs are visible in the terrain, together with some inscriptions and fragments of monumental architecture.

Career Roth is best known for his contributions as a writer and editor on major Holocaust themes. His work began with the 1979 publication of Consuming Fire: Encounters with Elie Wiesel and the Holocaust. In later interviews, Roth acknowledged the depth of the influence of Elie Wiesel on his life as a writer and person. Later volumes include Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy (with Richard Rubenstein, 1987), Holocaust: Religious and Philosophical Implications (ed. with Michael Berenbaum, 1989) and Memory Offended: The Auschwitz Convent Controversy (ed. with Carol Rittner), 1991. Roth made national news in 1998 soon after being chosen to direct the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum based on public comments Roth has made several years earlier. Columnist George Will and others portrayed Roth as a liberal relativist who could not be trusted to understand the unique evil of the Holocaust. To avoid distracting from the Museum's work, Roth withdrew from the position. He incorporated some of the lessons of this experience in his later book Holocaust Politics. As he continued work on Holocaust studies, he also became interested in global violence, founding the Center for the Study of the Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights (2003; now the Mgrublian Center for Human Rights) at Claremont McKenna College.

Development and design The DH.56 Hyena was developed to meet the requirements of Air Ministry Specification 30/24 for an Army Cooperation aircraft to equip Britain's Royal Air Force. It was a development of de Havilland's earlier DH.42B Dingo, and like the Dingo, was a single-engined two-bay biplane carrying a crew of two. It was armed with a forward-firing Vickers machine gun and a Lewis gun operated by the observer. A hook to pick up messages was fitted beneath the fuselage, while the aircraft was also equipped for photography, artillery spotting, supply dropping and bombing.Jackson 1987, p.213. The first Hyena flew on 17 May 1925, powered by a 385 hp (287 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar III radial engine. With this engine it was underpowered, and was quickly re- engined with a 422 hp (315 kW) Jaguar IV before it was submitted for official testing (which was against the requirements of Specification 20/25, which had superseded 30/24). The two prototype Hyenas were tested against the other competitors for the RAF's orders, the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, the Bristol Bloodhound and the Vickers Vespa, including field evaluation with No. 4 Squadron RAF.Jackson 1987, pp. 214‚Äì215. Handling close to the ground was found to be difficult, with a poor view from the cockpit, and the orders went to the Atlas, with the Hyena being abandoned, being used for testing at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough until 1928.

Ehrman, a New Testament scholar at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This work includes a narrative of Ehrman's own progression in Biblical studies and beliefs, an overview of the issues raised by scholarly analysis of the Bible, details of a selection of findings from such analysis, and an exhortation regarding the importance of coming to understand the Bible more fully. Regarding the importance of Biblical study, Ehrman says in the preface, \\"This kind of information is relevant not only to scholars like me, who devote their lives to serious research, but also to everyone who is interested in the Bible -- whether they personally consider themselves believers or not. In my opinion this really matters. Whether you are a believer -- fundamentalist, evangelical, moderate, liberal -- or a nonbeliever, the Bible is the most significant book in the history of our civilization. Coming to understand what it actually is, and is not, is one of the most important intellectual endeavors that anyone in our society can embark upon.\\" One particular statement from early on appears to summarize the development of the subject matter that Ehrman attempts to cover in this volume: \\"Scholars of the Bible have made significant progress in understanding the Bible over the past two hundred years, building on archaeological discoveries, advances in our knowledge of the ancient Hebrew and Greek languages in which the book of Scripture were originally written, and deep and penetrating historical, literary, and textual analyses.\\" Reception Jesus, Interrupted became a New York Times best-seller, joining Ehrman's previous popular work of textual criticism Misquoting Jesus. Critics applauded Ehrman's writing ability.John Blake \\"...even many of Ehrman's critics say he has a knack for making arcane New Testament scholarship accessible to the public.\\"Bishop William H. Willimon in ibid commented \\"He has a gift for clear thinking and an ability to present some complicated things in simple, direct ways.\\" Rev. Guy Williams noted that \\"His take on the scriptures is a gift to the church because of his ability to articulate questions and challenges. It gives us an opportunity to wrestle with the [Bible's] claims and questions.\\" Michael J. Kruger, Associate Professor of New Testament at Reformed Theological Seminary called it \\"a book full of ironies\\" and \\"intellectual schizophrenia,\\" stating that \\"it purports to be about unbiased history but rarely presents an opposing viewpoint; ironic that it claims to follow the scholarly consensus but breaks from it so often; ironic that it insists on the historical-critical method but then reads the gospels with a modernist, overly-literal hermeneutic; ironic that it claims no one view of early Christianity could be 'right' (Walter Bauer) but then proceeds to tell us which view of early Christianity is 'right;'\\"Michael J. Kruger, \\"A Review of Jesus, Interrupted\\", Westminster Theological Journal 71, no.2, Fall 2009. Another criticism raised, which was also raised over Misquoting Jesus, is that Ehrman implies that the information being presented is new, or groundbreaking. Bishop William H. Willimon says, \\"He keeps presenting this stuff as if this is wonderful new knowledge that has been kept from you backward lay people and this is the stuff your preachers don't have the guts to tell, and I have.\\" Rich Barlow, of the Boston Globe, writes that \\"he repeatedly stresses that historical-critical study need not kill faith. And, honest scholar that he is, he admits that some of his contentions can be challenged.\\" Dr. James F. McGrath of Patheos called the book \\"a readable overview presenting information about the Bible and early Christianity that ought by now to be common knowledge. The reason it is not probably is due largely to the belief that such critical study of the Bible is antithetical to the Christian faith, and that the appropriate Christian stance is to affirm the Bible‚Äôs inerrancy rather than allow one‚Äôs view of the Bible and other matters to be shaped by the Bible‚Äôs actual contents.\\" Bibliography * ReferencesExternal links *Jesus, Interrupted from HarperCollins *A review of Jesus, Interrupted by New Testament scholar Michael J.

It was devised by Whitney K. Newey and Kenneth D. West in 1987, although there are a number of later variants. The estimator is used to try to overcome autocorrelation (also called serial correlation), and heteroskedasticity in the error terms in the models, often for regressions applied to time series data. The abbreviation \\"HAC,\\" sometimes used for the estimator, stands for \\"heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent.\\" The problem in autocorrelation, often found in time series data, is that the error terms are correlated over time. This can be demonstrated in Q^*, a matrix of sums of squares and cross products that involves \\\\sigma_{(ij)} and the rows of X. The least squares estimator b is a consistent estimator of \\\\beta. This implies that the least squares residuals e_i are \\"point-wise\\" consistent estimators of their population counterparts E_i. The general approach, then, will be to use X and e to devise an estimator of Q^*. This means that as the time between error terms increases, the correlation between the error terms decreases. The estimator thus can be used to improve the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression when the residuals are heteroskedastic and/or autocorrelated. : Q^*=\\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum^{T}_{t=1} e_t^{2}x_t x'_t + \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum^{L}_{\\\\ell=1} \\\\sum^{T}_{t=\\\\ell+1} w_{\\\\ell} e_t e_{t-\\\\ell}(x_t x'_{t-\\\\ell} + x_{t-\\\\ell} x'_t) : w_\\\\ell=1 - \\\\frac\\\\ell {L+1} w_\\\\ell can be thought of as a \`weight'. Disturbances that are farther apart from each other are given lower weight, while those with equal subscripts are given a weight of 1. This ensures that second term converges (in some appropriate sense) to a finite matrix. This weighting scheme also ensures that the resulting covariance matrix is positive semi-definite .  Software implementations  In Julia, the CovarianceMatrices.jl package supports several types of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix estimation including Newey‚ÄìWest, White, and Arellano. In R, the packages \`sandwich\` and \`plm\` include a function for the Newey‚ÄìWest estimator. In Stata, the command \`newey\` produces Newey‚ÄìWest standard errors for coefficients estimated by OLS regression. In MATLAB, the command \`hac\` in the Econometrics toolbox produces the Newey‚ÄìWest estimator (among others). In Python, the \`statsmodels\` module includes functions for the covariance matrix using Newey-West. In Gretl, the option \`--robust\` to several estimation commands (such as \`ols\`) in the context of a time-series dataset produces Newey‚ÄìWest standard errors. In SAS, the Newey-West corrected standard errors can be obtained in PROC AUTOREG and PROC MODEL  See also  *Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors  References  Further reading   * * Category:Estimator Category:Regression with time series structure ","title":"Newey‚ÄìWest estimator"},{"id":"22852277","text":"Xonqa District (/–•–æ–Ω“õ–∞ —Ç—É–º–∞–Ω–∏, ÿÆÿßŸÜŸÇ€ï ÿ™€áŸÖ€ïŸÜŸâ) is a district of Xorazm Region in Uzbekistan.

It first aired on December 20, 1976 on NBC and starred Lance Kerwin, Brian Keith, DeAnn Mears, and Landon's Little House on the Prairie daughter, Melissa Sue Anderson. The film was nominated for two Emmys. Synopsis The Loneliest Runner follows the story of 13-year-old John Curtis, played by Kerwin (and based on Landon), who still wets his bed. The problem is publicized by his mother Alice (Mears), who goes so far as to hang her son's stained bed sheets out the window for everyone to see. Fearing his friends will see the stained sheets, John runs home from school every day and takes them down to avoid further humiliation. Soon, however, the running becomes more than a race home but an ambition. Partly because he loves it, but also to help him forget the shame and hurt of his unhappy home life, John starts running with the junior track team in order to channel his anger. Ten years later, John Curtis (now played by Landon) is an Olympic marathon runner and a gold-medal-winner. During a post-race interview, he gives credit to his mother for his success as a runner. Creation of film Michael Landon was the real-life version of the loneliest runner. As a child, he wet his bed until he was 14 and his mother, Peggy O'Neill, really did hang his sheets to dry outside of his bedroom window as punishment. The dysfunctional family life that Landon experienced during his early life were also similar to the ones in this autobiographical film. The character of John Curtis is modeled after Landon himself, as are his parents and other supporting characters. He reused actor Walker Edmiston of Bonanza to play Doctor Claymore (who coincidentally later took two jobs on Little House guest starring as different Doctors in seasons five and nine, as well as an appearance in season three). Landon also asked his on-screen daughter, Melissa Sue Anderson to play Nancy Rizzi, saying the part was perfect for her. Melissa says she was both honored and thrilled to have been included. Prior to acting, Landon also had Olympic ambitions as a javelin thrower. Due to an injury in his shoulder ligaments during college, Landon was unable to pursue a career in sports and started acting, which eventually led to three very successful television series, in addition to other acting, directing, and writing jobs on other shows.

Tuckett in The Cambridge companion to Jesus edited by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 Cambridge Univ Press pp. 123‚Äì124 According to the canonical gospels, Jesus was arrested and tried by the Sanhedrin, and then sentenced by Pontius Pilate to be scourged, and finally crucified by the Romans.Studying the Historical Jesus: Evaluations of the State of Current Research edited by Bruce Chilton, Craig A.

Jesus and the Oral Gospel Tradition p. 185 Jesus was stripped of his clothing and offered vinegar mixed with myrrh or gall (likely posca), to drink after saying \\"I am thirsty\\". He was then hung between two convicted thieves and, according to the Gospel of Mark, died by the 9th hour of the day (at around 3:00 p.m.). During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating \\"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\\" which, according to the Gospel of John (John 19:20), was written in three languages (Hebrew, Latin, and Greek). They then divided his garments among themselves and cast lots for his seamless robe, according to the Gospel of John. According to the Gospel of John, after Jesus' death, one soldier pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died, then blood and water gushed from the wound. The Bible describes seven statements that Jesus made while he was on the cross, as well as several supernatural events that occurred. Collectively referred to as the Passion, Jesus' suffering and redemptive death by crucifixion are the central aspects of Christian theology concerning the doctrines of salvation and atonement. New Testament narrative The earliest detailed accounts of the death of Jesus are contained in the four canonical gospels. There are other, more implicit references in the New Testament epistles. In the synoptic gospels, Jesus predicts his death in three separate places.St Mark's Gospel and the Christian faith by Michael Keene (2002) pp. 24‚Äì25 All four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of Jesus' arrest, initial trial at the Sanhedrin and final trial at Pilate's court, where Jesus is flogged, condemned to death, is led to the place of crucifixion initially carrying his cross before Roman soldiers induce Simon of Cyrene to carry it, and then Jesus is crucified, entombed, and resurrected from the dead. His death is described as a sacrifice in the Gospels and other books of the New Testament. In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening.Powell, Mark A. Introducing the New Testament. Baker Academic, (2009). A depiction of the Raising of the Cross, by Sebastiano Mazzoni, 17th century, Ca' Rezzonico After arriving at Golgotha, Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh or gall to drink. Matthew's and Mark's Gospels record that he refused this. He was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves. According to some translations of the original Greek, the thieves may have been bandits or Jewish rebels.Reza Aslan (2014). Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth. Random House. . According to Mark's Gospel, he endured the torment of crucifixion from the third hour (between approximately 9 a.m. and noon), until his death at the ninth hour, corresponding to about 3 p.m. The soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating \\"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\\" which, according to the Gospel of John, was in three languages (Hebrew, Latin, and Greek), and then divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe. According to the Gospel of John, the Roman soldiers did not break Jesus' legs, as they did to the two crucified thieves (breaking the legs hastened the onset of death), as Jesus was dead already. Each gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, seven statements altogether.Ehrman, Bart D. (2009). Jesus, Interrupted. HarperCollins. In the Synoptic Gospels, various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion, including darkness, an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection of saints. Following Jesus' death, his body was removed from the cross by Joseph of Arimathea and buried in a rock-hewn tomb, with Nicodemus assisting.

For instance, only Matthew's gospel mentions an earthquake, resurrected saints who went to the city and that Roman soldiers were assigned to guard the tomb,; while Mark is the only one to state the time of the crucifixion (the third hour, or 9 a.m. - although it was probably as late as noon) and the centurion's report of Jesus' death.; The Gospel of Luke's unique contributions to the narrative include Jesus' words to the women who were mourning, one criminal's rebuke of the other, the reaction of the multitudes who left \\"beating their breasts\\", and the women preparing spices and ointments before resting on the Sabbath.; ; ; John is also the only one to refer to the request that the legs be broken and the soldier's subsequent piercing of Jesus' side (as fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy), as well as that Nicodemus assisted Joseph with burial.; According to the First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 15:4), Jesus was raised from the dead (\\"on the third day\\" counting the day of crucifixion as the first) and according to the canonical Gospels, appeared to his disciples on different occasions before ascending to heaven.; ; The account given in Acts of the Apostles says that Jesus remained with the apostles for forty days, whereas the account in the Gospel of Luke makes no clear distinction between the events of Easter Sunday and the Ascension.Geza Vermes, The Resurrection (Penguin, 2008), p. 148.E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus (Penguin, 1993), p. 276.

Evans 2001 p. 41 In the Antiquities of the Jews (written about 93 AD) Jewish historian Josephus stated (Ant 18.3) that Jesus was crucified by Pilate, writing that: > Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, ... He drew over to him > both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles ... And when Pilate, at the > suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross > ... Most modern scholars agree that while this Josephus passage (called the Testimonium Flavianum) includes some later interpolations, it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate.

(2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. . pp. 177‚Äì118. However, Sanhedrin 43a relates that Yeshu had been condemned to death by the royal government of Judea ‚Äì this lineage was stripped of all legal authority upon Herod the Great's ascension to the throne in 37 BCE, meaning the execution had to have taken place close to 40 years before Jesus was even born.L.

They hold this belief based on various interpretations of , which states: \\"they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them [or it appeared so unto them], ... Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself\\". Some early Christian Gnostic sects, believing Jesus did not have a physical substance, denied that he was crucified.

Eddy and Boyd state that it is now \\"firmly established\\" that there is non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus. Craig Blomberg states that most scholars in the third quest for the historical Jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable.Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey by Craig L.

Meier \\"How do we decide what comes from Jesus\\" in The Historical Jesus in Recent Research by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight (2006) pp. 126‚Äì128 Meier states that a number of other criteria, e.g., the criterion of multiple attestation (i.e., confirmation by more than one source) and the criterion of coherence (i.e., that it fits with other historical elements) help establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event.John P. Meier \\"How do we decide what comes from Jesus\\" in The Historical Jesus in Recent Research by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight (2006) pp. 132‚Äì136 While scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it. For example, both E. P. Sanders and Paula Fredriksen support the historicity of the crucifixion but contend that Jesus did not foretell his own crucifixion and that his prediction of the crucifixion is a \\"church creation\\". Geza Vermes also views the crucifixion as a historical event but provides his own explanation and background for it.A Century of Theological and Religious Studies in Britain, 1902‚Äì2007 by Ernest Nicholson 2004 pp. 125‚Äì126 Link 126 Although almost all ancient sources relating to crucifixion are literary, in 1968, an archeological discovery just northeast of Jerusalem uncovered the body of a crucified man dated to the 1st century, which provided good confirmatory evidence that crucifixions occurred during the Roman period roughly according to the manner in which the crucifixion of Jesus is described in the gospels.David Freedman (2000), Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, , p. 299. The crucified man was identified as Yehohanan ben Hagkol and probably died about AD 70, around the time of the Jewish revolt against Rome. The analyses at the Hadassah Medical School estimated that he died in his late 20s. Another relevant archaeological find, which also dates to the 1st century AD, is an unidentified heel bone with a spike discovered in a Jerusalem gravesite, now held by the Israel Antiquities Authority and displayed in the Israel Museum.Article on the Crucifixion of Jesus Details of the crucifixionChronology= There is no consensus regarding the exact date of the crucifixion of Jesus, although it is generally agreed by biblical scholars that it was on a Friday on or near Passover (Nisan 14), during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (who ruled AD 26‚Äì36). Various approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion, including the canonical Gospels, the chronology of the life of Paul, as well as different astronomical models. Scholars have provided estimates in the range 30‚Äì33 AD,Paul L. Maier \\"The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus\\" in Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M. Yamauchi 1989 pp. 113‚Äì129The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 p. 114Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times by Paul Barnett 2002 pp. 19‚Äì21 with Rainer Riesner stating that \\"the fourteenth of Nisan (7 April) of the year A.D. 30 is, apparently in the opinion of the majority of contemporary scholars as well, far and away the most likely date of the crucifixion of Jesus.\\"Rainer Riesner, Paul's Early Period: Chronology, Mission Strategy, Theology (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1998), p. 58. Another preferred date among scholars is Friday, April 3, 33 AD. The consensus of scholarship is that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, but a Thursday or Wednesday crucifixion have also been proposed.The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 pp. 142‚Äì143 Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion based on a \\"double sabbath\\" caused by an extra Passover sabbath falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon, ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath.Cyclopaedia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature: Volume 7 John McClintock, James Strong ‚Äì 1894 \\"... he lay in the grave on the 15th (which was a 'high day' or double Sabbath, because the weekly Sabbath coincided ...\\" Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday, not Friday, on the grounds of the mention of \\"three days and three nights\\" in before his resurrection, celebrated on Sunday. Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a \\"day and night\\" may refer to any part of a 24-hour period, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights. In Mark 15:25 crucifixion takes place at the third hour (9 a.m.) and Jesus' death at the ninth hour (3 p.m.).The Gospel of Mark, Volume 2 by John R. Donahue, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 p. 442 However, in John 19:14 Jesus is still before Pilate at the sixth hour. Scholars have presented a number of arguments to deal with the issue, some suggesting a reconciliation, e.g., based on the use of Roman timekeeping in John, since Roman timekeeping began at midnight and this would mean being before Pilate at the 6th hour was 6 a.m., yet others have rejected the arguments.Death of the Messiah, Volume 2 by Raymond E. Brown 1999 pp. 959‚Äì960Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pp. 188‚Äì190 Several scholars have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available, and time was often approximated to the closest three-hour period.Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 Harmony of the Gospels pp. 323‚Äì323New Testament History by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 pp. 173‚Äì174The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 p. 538 =Path to the crucifixion= Andrea di Bartolo, Way to Calvary, c. 1400. The cluster of halos at the left are the Virgin Mary in front, with the Three Marys. The three Synoptic Gospels refer to a man called Simon of Cyrene whom the Roman soldiers order to carry the cross after Jesus initially carries it but then collapses,, , while the Gospel of John just says that Jesus \\"bears\\" his own cross. Luke's gospel also describes an interaction between Jesus and the women among the crowd of mourners following him, quoting Jesus as saying \\"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?\\" The Gospel of Luke has Jesus address these women as \\"daughters of Jerusalem\\", thus distinguishing them from the women whom the same gospel describes as \\"the women who had followed him from Galilee\\" and who were present at his crucifixion. and Traditionally, the path that Jesus took is called Via Dolorosa (Latin for \\"Way of Grief\\" or \\"Way of Suffering\\") and is a street in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is marked by nine of the fourteen Stations of the Cross. It passes the Ecce Homo Church and the last five stations are inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. There is no reference to a woman named VeronicaLavinia Cohn-Sherbok, Who's who in Christianity, (Routledge 1998), p. 303. in the Gospels, but sources such as Acta Sanctorum describe her as a pious woman of Jerusalem who, moved with pity as Jesus carried his cross to Golgotha, gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead.Notes and Queries, Volume July 6‚ÄìDecember 1852, London, page 252The Archaeological journal (UK), Volume 7, 1850 p. 413Alban Butler, 2000 Lives of the Saints p. 84 =Location= A diagram of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the historical site The precise location of the crucifixion remains a matter of conjecture, but the biblical accounts indicate that it was outside the city walls of Jerusalem, accessible to passers-by and observable from some distance away. Eusebius identified its location only as being north of Mount Zion, which is consistent with the two most popularly suggested sites of modern times. Calvary as an English name for the place is derived from the Latin word for skull (calvaria), which is used in the Vulgate translation of \\"place of a skull\\", the explanation given in all four Gospels of the Aramaic word G√ªlgalt√¢ (transliterated into the Greek as ŒìŒøŒªŒ≥ŒøŒ∏·æ∂ (Golgotha)), which was the name of the place where Jesus was crucified.; ; ; The text does not indicate why it was so designated, but several theories have been put forward. One is that as a place of public execution, Calvary may have been strewn with the skulls of abandoned victims (which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions, but not Roman). Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery (which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites). A third is that the name was derived from the physical contour, which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word, i.e., the place of \\"a skull\\". While often referred to as \\"Mount Calvary\\", it was more likely a small hill or rocky knoll. The traditional site, inside what is now occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Christian Quarter of the Old City, has been attested since the 4th century. A second site (commonly referred to as Gordon's Calvary ), located further north of the Old City near a place popularly called the Garden Tomb, has been promoted since the 19th century. =People present= The dead Christ with the Virgin, John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene. Unknown painter of the 18th century The Gospel of Matthew describes many women at the crucifixion, some of whom are named in the Gospels. Aside from these women, the three Synoptic Gospels speak of the presence of others: \\"the chief priests, with the scribes and elders\\";; cf. , two robbers crucified, one on Jesus' right and one on his left,; whom the Gospel of Luke presents as the penitent thief and the impenitent thief; \\"the soldiers\\", \\"the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus\\";; cf. passers-by;; \\"bystanders\\",; ; cf. \\"the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle\\"; and \\"his acquaintances\\". The Gospel of John also speaks of women present, but only mentions the soldiers, and \\"the disciple whom Jesus loved\\". The Gospels also tell of the arrival, after the death of Jesus, of Joseph of Arimathea, , , and of Nicodemus. =Method and manner= Crucifixion of Jesus on a two-beamed cross, from the Sainte Bible (1866) Torture stake, a simple wooden torture stake. Image by Justus Lipsius. Whereas most Christians believe the gibbet on which Jesus was executed was the traditional two-beamed cross, the Jehovah's Witnesses hold the view that a single upright stake was used. The Greek and Latin words used in the earliest Christian writings are ambiguous. The Koine Greek terms used in the New Testament are () and (). The latter means wood (a live tree, timber or an object constructed of wood); in earlier forms of Greek, the former term meant an upright stake or pole, but in Koine Greek it was used also to mean a cross. The Latin word was also applied to objects other than a cross. However, early Christian writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam. For instance, the Epistle of Barnabas, which was certainly earlier than 135,For a discussion of the date of the work, see Information on Epistle of Barnabas and Andrew C. Clark, \\"Apostleship: Evidence from the New Testament and Early Christian Literature,\\" Evangelical Review of Theology, 1989, Vol. 13, p. 380 and may have been of the 1st century AD,John Dominic Crossan, The Cross that Spoke (), p. 121 the time when the gospel accounts of the death of Jesus were written, likened it to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300),Epistle of Barnabas, 9:7‚Äì8 and to the position assumed by Moses in .\\"The Spirit saith to the heart of Moses, that he should make a type of the cross and of Him that was to suffer, that unless, saith He, they shall set their hope on Him, war shall be waged against them for ever. Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any he stretched out his hands, and so Israel was again victorious\\" (Epistle of Barnabas, 12:2‚Äì3). Justin Martyr (100‚Äì165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: \\"That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb.\\" Irenaeus, who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having \\"five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails.\\"Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses, II, xxiv, 4 The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 p. 826 However, throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails.Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature, Part 2 by John Kitto 2003 p. 591 These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion.Renaissance art: a topical dictionary by Irene Earls 1987 p. 64 In the Western Church, before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other. Nails are almost always depicted in art, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross. The tradition also carries to Christian emblems, e.g. the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion.The visual arts: a history by Hugh Honour, John Fleming 1995 p. 526 The placing of the nails in the hands, or the wrists is also uncertain. Some theories suggest that the Greek word () for hand includes the wrist and that the Romans were generally trained to place nails through Destot's space (between the capitate and lunate bones) without fracturing any bones.The Crucifixion and Death of a Man Called Jesus by David A Ball 2010 pp. 82‚Äì84 Another theory suggests that the Greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the radius and ulna of the forearm.The Chronological Life of Christ by Mark E. Moore 2007 pp. 639‚Äì643 Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails.Holman Concise Bible Dictionary Holman, 2011 p. 148 Another issue of debate has been the use of a hypopodium as a standing platform to support the feet, given that the hands may not have been able to support the weight. In the 17th century Rasmus Bartholin considered a number of analytical scenarios of that topic. In the 20th century, forensic pathologist Frederick Zugibe performed a number of crucifixion experiments by using ropes to hang human subjects at various angles and hand positions. His experiments support an angled suspension, and a two-beamed cross, and perhaps some form of foot support, given that in an form of suspension from a straight stake (as used by the Nazis in the Dachau concentration camp during World War II), death comes rather quickly.Crucifixion and the Death Cry of Jesus Christ by Geoffrey L Phelan MD, 2009 pp. 106‚Äì111 =Words of Jesus spoken from the cross= Crucifixion, seen from the Cross, by James Tissot, c. 1890, Brooklyn Museum The Gospels describe various \\"last words\\" that Jesus said while on the cross,Thomas W. Walker, Luke, (Westminster John Knox Press, 2013) p. 84. as follows: Mark / Matthew * (Aramaic for \\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\\"). However, as Aramaic linguist Steve Caruso of AramaicNT.org explains, Jesus most likely spoke Galilean Aramaic, which would render the pronunciation of these words as follows: .http://aramaicnt.org/2015/03/31/my- god-my-god-why-have-you-forsaken-me/ The only words of Jesus on the cross mentioned in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a quotation of Psalm 22. Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, some commentators consider it a literary and theological creation; however, Geza Vermes points out that the verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the Hebrew in which it usually would have been recited, and suggests that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage.Geza Vermes, The Passion (Penguin, 2005) p. 75. Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as 'theologically correct and reassuring', he considers this phrase 'unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable'.Geza Vermes, The Passion (Penguin, 2005) p. 114. He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'.Geza Vermes, The Passion (Penguin, 2005) p. 122. Raymond Brown likewise comments that he finds 'no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote'.Raymond Brown, The Death of the Messiah Volume II (Doubleday, 1994) p. 1051 Luke * \\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\\" [Some early manuscripts do not have this] * \\"Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\\" * \\"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!\\" The Gospel of Luke does not include the aforementioned exclamation of Jesus mentioned in Matthew and Mark.John Haralson Hayes, Biblical Exegesis: A Beginner's Handbook (Westminster John Knox Press, 1987) pp. 104‚Äì105. The author suggests this possibly was designed to play down the suffering of Jesus and replace a cry of desperation with one of hope and confidence, in keeping with the message of the Gospel in which Jesus dies confident that he would be vindicated as God's righteous prophet. John * \\"Woman, behold, your son!\\" * \\"I thirst.\\" * \\"It is finished.\\" The words of Jesus on the cross, especially his last words, have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ.David Anderson-Berry, 1871 The Seven Sayings of Christ on the Cross, Glasgow: Pickering & Inglis PublishersRev.

Luke follows Mark; as does Matthew, additionally mentioning an earthquake and the resurrection of dead saints. No mention of any of these appears in John.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. \\"John\\" pp. 302‚Äì310 Darkness Christ on the Cross, by Carl Heinrich Bloch, showing the skies darkened In the synoptic narrative, while Jesus is hanging on the cross, the sky over Judea (or the whole world) is \\"darkened for three hours,\\" from the sixth to the ninth hour (noon to mid-afternoon). There is no reference to darkness in the Gospel of John account, in which the crucifixion does not take place until after noon.Edwin Keith Broadhead Prophet, Son, Messiah: Narrative Form and Function in Mark (Continuum, 1994) p. 196. Some ancient Christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event and mistook it for a solar eclipse, pointing out that an eclipse could not occur during the Passover, which takes place during the full moon when the moon is opposite the sun rather than in front of it. Christian traveler and historian Sextus Julius Africanus and Christian theologian Origen refer to Greek historian Phlegon, who lived in the 2nd century AD, as having written \\"with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place\\". Sextus Julius Africanus further refers to the writings of historian Thallus: \\"This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun.\\" Christian apologist Tertullian believed the event was documented in the Roman archives.\\"In the same hour, too, the light of day was withdrawn, when the sun at the very time was in his meridian blaze. Those who were not aware that this had been predicted about Christ, no doubt thought it an eclipse. You yourselves have the account of the world-portent still in your archives.\\" Colin Humphreys and W. G. Waddington of Oxford University considered the possibility that a lunar, rather than solar, eclipse might have taken place.Colin J. Humphreys and W. G. Waddington, The Date of the Crucifixion Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation 37 (March 1985) Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , p. 193 (However note that Humphreys places the Last Supper on a Wednesday) They concluded that such an eclipse would have been visible, for thirty minutes, from Jerusalem and suggested the gospel reference to a solar eclipse was the result of a scribe wrongly amending a text. Historian David Henige dismisses this explanation as 'indefensible' and astronomer Bradley Schaefer points out that the lunar eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours.Schaefer, B. E.

Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 103, 645‚Äì660. Modern biblical scholarship treats the account in the synoptic gospels as a literary creation by the author of the Mark Gospel, amended in the Luke and Matthew accounts, intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event, and not intended to be taken literally.Burton L.

Temple veil, earthquake and resurrection of dead saints The synoptic gospels state that the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The Gospel of Matthew mentions an account of earthquakes, rocks splitting, and the opening of the graves of dead saints and describes how these resurrected saints went into the holy city and appeared to many people.John Yueh-Han Yieh, One Teacher: Jesus' Teaching Role in Matthew's Gospel Report (Walter de Gruyter, 2005) p. 65; Robert Walter Funk, The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus (Harper San Francisco, 1998) pp. 129‚Äì270. In the Mark and Matthew accounts, the centurion in charge comments on the events: \\"Truly this man was the Son of God!\\" or \\"Truly this was the Son of God!\\". The Gospel of Luke quotes him as saying, \\"Certainly this man was innocent!\\" A widespread 6.3 magnitude earthquake has been confirmed to have taken place between 26‚Äì36 AD in the time of Jesus.Jefferson Williams, Markus Schwab and A. Brauer (2012). An early first-century earthquake in the Dead Sea. International Geology Review.full article The authors concluded that: Medical aspects A number of theories to explain the circumstances of the death of Jesus on the cross have been proposed by physicians and Biblical scholars. In 2006, Matthew W. Maslen and Piers D. Mitchell reviewed over 40 publications on the subject with theories ranging from cardiac rupture to pulmonary embolism.Medical theories on the cause of death in Crucifixion J R Soc Med April 2006 vol. 99 no. 4 185‚Äì188. Bronzino's Deposition of Christ In 1847, based on the reference in the Gospel of John () to blood and water coming out when Jesus' side was pierced with a spear, physician William Stroud proposed the ruptured heart theory of the cause of Christ's death which influenced a number of other people.William Stroud, 1847, Treatise on the Physical Death of Jesus Christ London: Hamilton and Adams.William Seymour, 2003, The Cross in Tradition, History and Art The cardiovascular collapse theory is a prevalent modern explanation and suggests that Jesus died of profound shock. According to this theory, the scourging, the beatings, and the fixing to the cross would have left Jesus dehydrated, weak, and critically ill and that this would have led to cardiovascular collapse.The Physical Death Of Jesus Christ, Study by The Mayo Clinic citing studies by Bucklin R (The legal and medical aspects of the trial and death of Christ. Sci Law 1970; 10:14‚Äì26), Mikulicz-Radeeki FV (The chest wound in the crucified Christ. Med News 1966; 14:30‚Äì40), Davis CT (The Crucifixion of Jesus: The passion of Christ from a medical point of view.

Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, physician William Edwards and his colleagues supported the combined cardiovascular collapse (via hypovolemic shock) and exhaustion asphyxia theories, assuming that the flow of water from the side of Jesus described in the Gospel of John was pericardial fluid.Edwards, William D.; Gabel, Wesley J.; Hosmer, Floyd E; On the Physical Death of Jesus, JAMA March 21, 1986, Vol 255, No. 11, pp. 1455‚Äì1463 In his book The Crucifixion of Jesus, physician and forensic pathologist Frederick Zugibe studied the likely circumstances of the death of Jesus in great detail.Frederick Zugibe, 2005, The Crucifixion of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry Evans Publishing, JW Hewitt, The Use of Nails in the Crucifixion Harvard Theological Review, 1932 Zugibe carried out a number of experiments over several years to test his theories while he was a medical examiner. These studies included experiments in which volunteers with specific weights were hanging at specific angles and the amount of pull on each hand was measured, in cases where the feet were also secured or not. In these cases the amount of pull and the corresponding pain was found to be significant. Pierre Barbet, a French physician, and the chief surgeon at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Paris,New Scientist October 12, 1978, p. 96 hypothesized that Jesus would have had to relax his muscles to obtain enough air to utter his last words, in the face of exhaustion asphyxia.Barbet, Pierre. Doctor at Calvary, New York: Image Books, 1963. Some of Barbet's theories, e.g., location of nails, are disputed by Zugibe. Orthopedic surgeon Keith Maxwell not only analyzed the medical aspects of the crucifixion, but also looked back at how Jesus could have carried the cross all the way along Via Dolorosa.Keith Maxwell MD on the Crucifixion of Christ In an article for the Catholic Medical Association, Phillip Bishop and physiologist Brian Church suggested a new theory based on suspension trauma.Catholic Medical Association, Linacre Quarterly, August 2006 In 2003, historians FP Retief and L. Cilliers reviewed the history and pathology of crucifixion as performed by the Romans and suggested that the cause of death was often a combination of factors. They also state that Roman guards were prohibited from leaving the scene until death had occurred. Theological significance Adoration of the Mystic Lamb (detail of the Ghent Altarpiece, Jan van Eyck, c. 1432). Christ is represented as the sacrificial Lamb of God.

Essays on Christology by Mark Allan Powell and David R. Bauer 1999 p. 106 Christians believe Jesus' suffering was foretold in the Hebrew Bible, such as in Psalm 22, and Isaiah's songs of the suffering servant. In Johannine \\"agent Christology\\" the submission of Jesus to crucifixion is a sacrifice made as an agent of God or servant of God, for the sake of eventual victory.The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 p. 79The Johannine exegesis of God by Daniel Rathnakara Sadananda 2005 p. 281 This builds on the salvific theme of the Gospel of John which begins in John 1:29 with John the Baptist's proclamation: \\"The Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world\\".Johannine Christology and the Early Church by T. E. Pollard 2005 p. 21Studies in Early Christology by Martin Hengel 2004 p. 371 Further reinforcement of the concept is provided in Revelation 21:14 where the \\"lamb slain but standing\\" is the only one worthy of handling the scroll (i.e. the book) containing the names of those who are to be saved.Studies in Revelation by Martin Ralph DeHaan, 1998 p. 103 A central element in the Christology presented in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened \\"with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan\\".New Testament christology by Frank J. Matera 1999 p. 67 In this view, as in Acts 2:23, the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus \\"at the hands of the lawless\\" is viewed as the fulfillment of the plan of God.The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns by Marion L. Soards 1994 p. 34 Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term \\"the cross of Christ\\" used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.Christology by Hans Schwarz 1998 pp. 132‚Äì134 For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences, as in 1 Corinthians 2:8. In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Philippians 2:8) died \\"at the right time\\" (Romans 4:25) based on the plan of God. For Paul the \\"power of the cross\\" is not separable from the Resurrection of Jesus. However, the belief in the redemptive nature of Jesus' death predates the Pauline letters and goes back to the earliest days of Christianity and the Jerusalem church.Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity by Larry W. Hurtado (2005) pp. 130‚Äì133 The Nicene Creed's statement that \\"for our sake he was crucified\\" is a reflection of this core belief's formalization in the fourth century.Christian Theology by J. Glyndwr Harris (2002) pp. 12‚Äì15 John Calvin supported the \\"agent of God\\" Christology and argued that in his trial in Pilate's Court Jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father.Calvin's Christology by Stephen Edmondson 2004 p. 91The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures by Hughes Oliphant Old 2002 p. 125 This Christological theme continued into the 20th century, both in the Eastern and Western Churches. In the Eastern Church Sergei Bulgakov argued that the crucifixion of Jesus was \\"pre-eternally\\" determined by the Father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam.The Lamb of God by Sergei Bulgakov 2008 p. 129 In the Western Church, Karl Rahner elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God (and the water from the side of Jesus) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water.Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 p. 74 = Atonement = Jesus' death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words.For example, see . See also Sermon on the Mount According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom.A. J. Wallace, R. D. Rusk Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation, (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011) Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the Crucifixion of Jesus was part of the Atonement. \\"The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the foreordained but voluntary act of the Only Begotten Son of God. He offered his life, including his innocent body, blood, and spiritual anguish as a redeeming ransom (1) for the effect of the Fall of Adam upon all mankind and (2) for the personal sins of all who repent, from Adam to the end of the world. Latter-day Saints believe this is the central fact, the crucial foundation, the chief doctrine, and the greatest expression of divine love in the Plan of Salvation.\\" In the Roman Catholic tradition this view of atonement is balanced by the duty of Roman Catholics to perform Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ which in the encyclical Miserentissimus Redemptor of Pope Pius XI were defined as \\"some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury\\" with respect to the sufferings of Jesus. Pope John Paul II referred to these Acts of Reparation as the \\"unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified.\\" Among Eastern Orthodox Christians, another common view is Christus Victor.See Development of the Christus Victor view after Aul√©n This holds that Jesus was sent by God to defeat death and Satan. Because of his perfection, voluntary death, and resurrection, Jesus defeated Satan and death, and arose victorious. Therefore, humanity was no longer bound in sin, but was free to rejoin God through faith in Jesus. Denial of crucifixionDocetism= In Christianity, docetism is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality... Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion. =Nag Hammadi Manuscripts= According to the First Revelation of James in the Nag Hammadi library, Jesus appeared to James after apparently being crucified and stated that another person had been inflicted in his place: =Islam= Most Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. Professor and scholar Mahmoud M. Ayoub sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments: The below quranic verse says Jesus was neither killed nor crucified: Contrary to Christian teachings, some Islamic traditions teach that Jesus ascended to Heaven without being put on the cross, but that God transformed another person to appear exactly like him and to be then crucified instead of him. This thought is supported in misreading an account by Irenaeus, the 2nd-century Alexandrian Gnostic Basilides when refuting what he believes to be a heresy denying the death.\\"Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all\\" (Irenaeus, Against Heresies, book I, ch. 24, 4). = Gnosticism = Some scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of Jesus' death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence. According to the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Yaldabaoth (the Creator of the material universe) and his Archons tried to kill Jesus by crucifixion, but only killed their own man (that is the body). While Jesus ascended from his body, Yaldabaoth and his followers thought Jesus to be dead.John Douglas Turner, Anne Marie McGuire The Nag Hammadi Library After Fifty Years: Proceedings of the 1995 Society of Biblical Literature Commemoration [in Philadelphia] Brill 1997 p. 54Tuomas RasimusParadise Reconsidered in Gnostic Mythmaking: Rethinking Sethianism in Light of the Ophite Evidence Brill, 2009 p. 13 In Apocalypse of Peter, Peter talks with the savior whom the \\"priests and people\\" believed to have killed.John Douglas Turner, Anne Marie McGuire The Nag Hammadi Library After Fifty Years: Proceedings of the 1995 Society of Biblical Literature Commemoration [in Philadelphia] Brill 1997 p. 55 Manichaeism, which was influenced by Gnostic ideas, adhered to the idea that not Jesus, but somebody else was crucified instead. Jesus suffering on the cross is depicted as the state of light particles (spirit) within matter instead.Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition Shambhala Publications 2009 p. 596 According to Bogomilism, the crucifixion was an attempt by Lucifer to destroy Jesus, while the earthly Jesus was regarded as a prophet, Jesus himself was an immaterial being that can not be killed. Accordingly, Lucifer failed and Jesus' sufferings on the cross were only an illusion.Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition Shambhala Publications 2009 p. 751 = Others = According to some Christian sects in Japan, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead his younger brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross, while Jesus fled across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan. Once in Japan, he became a rice farmer, married, and raised a family with three daughters near what is now Shing≈ç. While in Japan, it is asserted that he traveled, learned, and eventually died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. According to the customs of the time, Jesus' bones were collected, bundled, and buried in a mound. There is also a museum in Japan which claims to have evidence of these claims. In Yazidism, Jesus is thought of as a \\"figure of light\\" who could not be crucified. This interpretation could be taken from the Quran or Gnostics.Zeitschrift f√ºr Religionswissenschaft. Jahrgang 1997 diagonal-Verlag Ursula Spuler-Stegemann Der Engel Pfau zum Selbstvert√§ndnis der Yezidi p. 14 (German) In art, symbolism and devotions Detail of the countenance of Christ just dead, by Jos√© Luj√°n P√©rez, 1793, Las Palmas Cathedral Since the crucifixion of Jesus, the cross has become a key element of Christian symbolism, and the crucifixion scene has been a key element of Christian art, giving rise to specific artistic themes such as Ecce Homo, The Raising of the Cross, Descent from the Cross and Entombment of Christ. The Crucifixion, seen from the Cross by Tissot presented a novel approach at the end of the 19th century, in which the crucifixion scene was portrayed from the perspective of Jesus.James Tissot: the Life of Christ by Judith F. Dolkart 2009 p. 201 The symbolism of the cross which is today one of the most widely recognized Christian symbols was used from the earliest Christian times and Justin Martyr who died in 165 describes it in a way that already implies its use as a symbol, although the crucifix appeared later. Masters such as Caravaggio, Rubens and Titian have all depicted the Crucifixion scene in their works. Devotions based on the process of crucifixion, and the sufferings of Jesus are followed by various Christians. The Stations of the Cross follows a number of stages based on the stages involved in the crucifixion of Jesus, while the Rosary of the Holy Wounds is used to meditate on the wounds of Jesus as part of the crucifixion. The presence of the Virgin Mary under the cross has in itself been the subject of Marian art, and well known Catholic symbolism such as the Miraculous Medal and Pope John Paul II's Coat of Arms bearing a Marian Cross. And a number of Marian devotions also involve the presence of the Virgin Mary in Calvary, e.g., Pope John Paul II stated that \\"Mary was united to Jesus on the Cross\\". Well known works of Christian art by masters such as Raphael (e.g., the Mond Crucifixion), and Caravaggio (e.g., his Entombment) depict the Virgin Mary as part of the crucifixion scene.

Hopkins is a small coastal Garifuna community in the Stann Creek District of southern Belize. The center exists with the goals of keeping Garifuna music alive, passing traditional music along to young people in the community, and sharing music with visitors to Hopkins. The center‚Äôs focus is on traditional percussion music, though guitars have been donated and are also played. The young people who play and take lessons at the drumming center perform regularly, and in 2006, they recorded a CD entitled Traditional Garifuna Music played by Youth from Hopkins, Belize, published by Innova Recordings. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Traditional Music category.  Garifuna instruments  Traditional Garifuna drums, or garaones, are handmade of mahogany wood and deer hide. The drumhead is secured to the wooden body with cordage that is laced around the head and attached through holes at the bottom of the drum. These are tension drums; they are tuned by way of wooden pegs attached to the cordage that can be wound to tighten or loosen the drumhead. Additionally, these drums often have a thin wire or piece of fishing line stretched across the head in order to create a buzzing sound, an aesthetic which is common in much Central and West African music, and has been preserved in Garifuna music. The drums at Lebeha are crafted by master drum-maker Austin Rodriguez, whose workshop is located in Dangriga, Belize. There are two main types of drums used in Garifuna music: Primero and Segunda. The primera (or lanigi, ‚Äúheart-drum‚Äù, in Garifuna) is the higher-pitched of the two, and serves to accent dancers‚Äô movements. The segunda, or lufarugu (‚Äúshadow-drum‚Äù), which provides the beat for dancers. Sometimes a third drum, the tercera, or luruwahn (‚Äúthird drum‚Äù) is the lowest-pitched of the three and serves as a bass drum. The presence of the tercera allows the Segunda to play more syncopated rhythms.  Traditional Garifuna music  Punta is a traditional Belizean music and dance, often performed during festivals. This is the genre that has influenced the evolution of the popular music style punta rock. Paranda refers to both a Garifuna rhythm, and a musical genre that features Garifuna drumming, guitar, and singing. Lyrics in this genre are often nostalgic, and paranda is usually performed by men. One can hear the Latin/Spanish influence in this style of music.  Popular Garifuna music  Belize's most well-known popular musical style is Punta rock, a style of dance music that combines traditional Garifuna rhythms with western popular music elements, including electric and bass guitars and keyboard.

She is known for her music which has often incorporated traditional Chinese music into contemporary contexts, and is currently Professor of Music at Dartmouth College.Dept. of Music page at Dartmouth She has released two albums on the Other Minds record label: Hands Like Waves Unfold (2008) and Since When Has the Bright Moon Existed? (2011).  Background in China  After being told at the age of 15 by a teacher that she would never become a successful pianist or conductor because of her physical stature, Dong applied to the composers program at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. She was too young to be accepted and was sent to the high school program affiliated with the conservatory to study composition and theory rather than performance. After graduating from high school, she enrolled at the Central Conservatory. Here, the main focus of her studies was Western art music, from Mozart through Ravel and Debussy. Students were also required to play a traditional Chinese instrument, as well as take classes on Chinese folk music and opera. Every summer, the school also gave composition students a small amount of money to collect folk songs in remote villages. Dong says that hearing and collecting these songs would form a lasting impression on her and her music. After four years at the Conservatory, Dong continued with the master's degree program. During these years Dong composed (with co-author Duo Huang) music for the three-act ballet Imperial Concubine Young, commissioned by the Central Ballet Group of Beijing. The music and choreography was completed for the piece in 1989, and it was premiered with full production and continued for the following two-year season. The reactions to the music of this ballet were a mix, ranging from rave reviews to being criticized as \\"too symphonic and complicated to function as traditional ballet music\\", \\"not Chinese enough\\", and \\"violent\\". Dong and many of her classmates were encouraged to continue their studies abroad, and she chose Stanford University.  Compositional periods while in the US (1991‚Äìpresent)  During her years studying at Stanford from 1991 to 1994, Dong did not compose much. Her idea of modernity, which was Stravinsky, Bart√≥k, and Prokofiev, was being bombarded with new forms of music she was being newly exposed to. One of these forms was computer music. The first computer piece that Dong composed, Flying Apples (1994), experiments with algorithms. There is one main timbre in the piece, which sounds something like a metallic piano. Dong says she was attracted to the visual, abstract patterns of sound that the algorithms created. Moments in her later computer music would mirror this aesthetic. When Dong began to compose more regularly again, she deems the pieces during this time as her \\"Chinese music\\" period. Being exposed to so many new types of music, Dong held on to the musical language she knew well to keep from becoming disoriented. Most of her pieces of this time use heterophonic imitation rather than western counterpoint, are inspired by folk songs or tales, or are written for traditional Chinese instruments. One example of this is Pangu's Song (1998) written for alto flute/flute and percussion. Pangu is the giant in Chinese mythology who separated heaven and earth with a great swing of his axe. He held them separate for eighteen thousand years, then was laid to rest, his breath becoming the wind, his eyes the moon and the sun, his body the mountains, his veins the rivers, his sweat the rain, and the creatures carried by the wind over his body became human beings. The piece is not a narrative of the myth, but evokes an earthy sound with use of the alto flute and frequent fluttertongue, which has a breathy timbre closer to a bamboo flute. The percussion also evokes the natural world with use of woodblock, Chinese bass drum, and Tibetan singing bowl. Other pieces during this period include Blue Melody (1993), written for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano, and inspired by a folk song collected in a remote village; and Three Voices (1998), written for zheng, erhu, and xiao. In these pieces, there is a conscious effort to sound Chinese, even within the framework or orchestration of Western art music. In 1998 Dong met the composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. Stanford was hosting a reception for Ligeti's visit to campus, which Dong attended. She remembers Ligeti walking up to her and asking directly and immediately, \\"How many students died during the student movement in China?\\" Dong answered, \\"Isn't one enough?\\", and walked away from him. Ligeti must have been moved or at least interested in her reply, because later in the day he found her and said that they should have lunch together. Although Dong admits that it is difficult to pin-point the direct influence of Ligeti on her musical compositions, she says that Ligeti affected her life in a more philosophical way on a deeper level. At the time, Dong's English was poor, but she never felt that the two had trouble communicating with one another. Although 40 years her senior, Ligeti's experiences in Romania and Hungary during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia were similar to Kui's in China during the student movements, and when sharing their experiences, they often felt that \\"history was repeating itself.\\" Dong does admit one conversation with Ligeti that did directly affect her identity as a composer. When Ligeti asked her what kind of composer she wanted to be known as, she replied \\"a Chinese composer\\". He then asked her why she wanted to be a Chinese composer. Dong could not provide a clear reason or justify herself. After that conversation, Dong began questioning her identity as a composer and why she felt the need to make her music recognizably Chinese. This marked the beginning of Dong's compositions that began testing the boundaries of what was Chinese and what was Western in her music. In these pieces, she creates a clash between sounds of each culture rather than limit herself to writing \\"Chinese\\" music within a Western art music context. Dong's computer piece Crossing is representative of this period. In this piece, the jarring juxtaposition between rock 'n roll slap bass guitar and a well-known Beijing opera character is in no way subtle. The timbres in Crossing are varied, unpredictable, and dissonantly opposed with one another, very different from her earlier computer piece Flying Apples, which is largely a single timbre. In 1999 Dong began to improvise with Christian Wolff and Larry Polansky, and they formed an ensemble called Trio. This would add another element to her compositions that we see in her work Earth, Water, Wood, Metal, Fire (2001), which were based on Dong's piano improvisations. In these pieces, Dong takes inspiration from the five elements that make up the material world according to traditional Chinese beliefs, but is not seeking to write a programmatic piece. For example, Dong says that the piece Earth does not refer literally to soil, but rather is a spiritual representation of mankind that inhabits the earth. The movements Wood and Metal refer to pencils and metal rods placed in the piano strings that create distinct timbres. Fire, the last movement, is the longest and most energetic not because of the element fire's importance in mythology, but because compositionally its length allowed previous themes to return and bring the work to a close. The prepared piano shows influences of John Cage, the clusters of dissonant chords are suggestive of Henry Cowell, and repeated, stagnantly moving sections could be described stylistically as minimalist music. However, there are also fragmentary moments of pentatonic melodies as well as heterophonic passages which create the flavor of Chinese music, but in a more subtle manner than previous works. In these pieces, after being in the US for ten years, Dong finally seems to be able to amalgamate the influences that she has been exposed to and bring them together in a balanced way. Another piece that Dong considers part of this \\"Fusion\\" period is Shui Diao Ge To & Song. The texts for this work were the 11th century poem Shui Diao Ge by Su Shi and a contemporary poem, Song, by a friend of the composer named Denise Newman. Dong felt that these two texts balanced each other within the composition, and that her work would not be complete without one or the other. Written for mixed chorus and percussion, the piece was commissioned by the Dale Warland Singers but was deemed too difficult to perform by their conductor and was eventually premiered by Volti (then known as the San Francisco Chamber Singers) in 2003. Dong views this piece as a \\"cultural amalgam of all her life's experiences\\". In 2004, Dong wrote the piece Ludamus Denuo, which she still considers part of her \\"Fusion\\" period, but is moving in a new direction. The text of the piece is a 20th-century English poem written for children, which Dong has translated into medieval Latin and set for children's choir. Here, Dong is attempting to create a sense of timelessness and stylistic anonymity in the piece. At certain sections the piece is motet- like and at other instances evokes more of a twentieth-century harmony. When it was suggested to Dong that the piece did not sound stylistically \\"Chinese\\", she replied by saying that she is Chinese herself and asked how anything written by herself could possibly not be Chinese.  Cultural influences  Although Chinese music and Western art music are strong influences, her iTunes listening spans everything from classical Indian music, to Rachmaninoff, to James Blunt (popular for his song \\"You‚Äôre Beautiful\\"), to Japanese opera.  Analysis of The Seasons  One of Dong's latest pieces, entitled The Seasons or Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, also is from her \\"fusion period\\". The first movement, \\"Spring\\", is included on an album Ring of Fire released by the Del Sol String Quartet on the Other Minds label, which includes composers, including Dong, who have worked extensively on the Pacific Rim. The piece is written for string quartet and four Chinese musicians, who play the zheng (Chinese harp), dulcimer, sheng (mouth organ), and Chinese percussion (bass drum, tom-tom, cymbal, opera gongs, temple blocks). Dong says that the work is an homage to John Cage and Antonio Vivaldi, who both wrote music inspired based on the four seasons, solo piano in the case of John Cage, and a violin concerto in the case of Vivaldi. The first movement, \\"Spring\\", is based on a symmetrical chord structure based on the third (C, E) and gradually moving outward in thirds to expand the chord (A, C, E, G, then F, A, C, E, G, B). The entire piece basically moves from an Am7 chord to a F11 chord.

The 1938 courthouse replaced the so-called \\"million-dollar courthouse\\" built in 1871, whose last payment on the approximately $800,000 it cost was coincidentally made in 1938. In 1937 Lincoln County began to receive the proceeds of a major boom in lead and zinc mining that ran through the 1950s and provided a major portion of the county's tax revenues. As the old county courthouse deteriorated, sentiment grew to replace it, resulting in a 1937 bond issue. At the same time the county received a grant of $26,800 from the Public Works Administration toward 45% of the cost of a new courthouse. The PWA money carried conditions, one of which was a close review of the design. A modern look was preferred, to the point that a simplified Art Deco-Art Moderne style became known as PWA Moderne. The new courthouse was designed by Las Vegas architect A.L. Worswick in this taste. After an initial bidding process in which all bids were above the $60,000 budget, a second bid in 1938 produced a low bid of $49,347. The bidder, L.F. Dow of Los Angeles and Las Vegas, completed the courthouse in 1939. The building has served as the county courthouse, jail, county sheriff's office and state office building ever since. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Atop of the building stands the Golden Dome, the most recognizable landmark of the university. Three buildings were built at the site; the first was built in 1843 and replaced with a larger one in 1865, which burned down in 1879, after which the third and current building was erected. The building hosts the administrative offices of the university, as well as classrooms, art collections, and exhibition spaces. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With . Map of district included with [text version available at National Park Service]. HistoryPrevious main buildings= The first main building was started on August 28, 1843, shortly after the architect Mr. Marsile arrived on campus on the 24th, and it was complete by the fall of 1844. It was a brick building, 4 1/2-story high with a small cupola (but not yet a dome) with a bell in it, in French style. 281x281px Construction of the second Main Building, which replaced the first, began in 1864 and was completed in 1865 with a cost of $35,500. The building's construction incorporated a major part of the previous building; its roof was removed and several floors were added along with a large mansard roof, and the facade and porch were altered. It was 160 feet long, 80 feet wide, and 90 feet high; it was six stories high and had a dome at the top. The dome was made of wood and covered in tin, and it was surmounted by a twelve feet tall, 1800 pounds wooden statue of Mary sculpted by Anthony Buscher of Chicago. Both the dome and the statue were painted white. The octagonal oratory under the dome hosted a $1500 solid gold crown made in France (which today is kept in the Main Building on display). The architect was William Thomas from Chicago, and most of the workers who built it were brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross. In a publicity stunt to give visibility to the college, Rev. Edward Sorin invited important clerics (including top-ranking American catholic cleric Bishop Martin John Spalding) and congressmen to the dedication on May 31, 1886. Classes were taught on the third floor which hosted thirteen large classrooms and professor rooms, the fourth and fifth floors hosted dormitories, while the refectory and study halls were situated on the first floor. The interior was decorated with 52 stands of medieval armor and a natural history museum, while the exterior featured a Cour d'honneur courtyard and a statue of Sacred Heart by Robert Cassiani, placed in 1893 and modeled after a similar one at Sacr√©-C≈ìur in Paris. =Fire of 1879= The building stood for 14 years before being destroyed by a great fire on April 23, 1879. About eleven in the morning on Wednesday, 23 April 1879, smoke and flames could be seen rising from the roof of the Main Building. The causes of the fire might be due to repairs on the roof, and the fire might have started due to the dry timber on the roof, although it was not possible to ascertain it. The fire was first spotted from the minim's courtyard, and soon early attempts at putting out the fire were made, with lines of people passing buckets of water towards the roof of the building by steam pressure. Despite these efforts, the fire had spread to the entire roof and quickly consumed the upper floors. The South Bend Fire Department was not able to arrive in time to save the main building, because of the long time needed to round up the volunteer firemen and set up the machines. The supports of the dome burned away and the statue went crashing below in a billow of sparks and flame, and efforts focused on rescuing whatever valuable effects might be carried out of the burning building. In the zeal to save precious objects students threw many of the valuables from the windows, yet despite the well-intentioned effort, almost all of these were lost in crashing on the ground. This was especially true for many of the precious books and manuscripts. The fire consumed the building in three hours. The building contained most of the school's educational and administrative activities, refectories, and student and faculty living quarters. The flames also consumed The Saint Francis Old Men's Home, the Infirmary, the Minims Hall (the grade school program), and the Music Hall. The fire fighters from South Bend arrived in time help save the kitchen, steam house, printing office, Presbytery, Washington Hall and Sacred Heart Church. Additionally, the lack of strong winds prevented the fire from spreading to these other buildings. Many students, nuns and faculty narrowly escaped serious injury or death while they tried to save the Main Building's contents as parts of the structure came tumbling down around them. Most of the university library, the scientific equipment, the paintings and sculptures that adorned the hallways, the furnishings and furniture, students' clothes and possessions, natural and skeletal collections were lost in the fire. The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance. 281x281px At three o'clock Father William Corby, the university president, met with his wisest assistants and they determined that nothing could be done but close the college for the year. An hour after he communicated the decision to the students assembled in the church. Students did not want to leave, but Fr. Corby made it clear that the university could not provide any accommodations, hence the students were sent home for the semester. An early graduation ceremony was held for the seniors of all schools. Corby also promised that \\"a new Notre Dame\\" would reopen in the fall with a new Main Building \\"more accommodating and grandiose\\". Condolences started to pour into the school immediately, many of them published in subsequent issues of the student weekly magazine Scholastic. Father Edward Sorin, now the superior-general of the Congregation of Holy Cross, had left on a trip to Europe two days prior to the fire. He immediately returned to campus after the fire to find much of his school in ruins. Together with Corby, he vowed to the students and faculty to rebuild the school in time for the fall semester. During the next Sunday's Mass, Rev. Sorin delivered the homily and said \\"If it were all gone, I should not give up!\\", which electrified the crowd and provided morale for the reconstruction. He wrote to the members of the congregation: \\"By all means we must bring upon these new foundations the richest blessings of Heaven, that the grand edifice we contemplate erecting may remain for ages to come a monument to Catholicism, and a stronghold which no destructive element can ever shake on its basis or bring down again from its majestic stand\\". =Current building= University founder Rev. Edward Sorin and the president at the time Rev. William Corby immediately planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the entire University. Donations for the rebuilding of the college came from the Congregation, alumni, people of Saint Mary's College, South Bend, and Chicago (where Notre Dame students had staged a benefit concert after the Chicago Fire of 1871). General William Tecumseh Sherman, whose sons had attended Notre Dame, sent army tents and supplies for the emergency and Chicago mayor Carter Harrison Sr. presided over a fund-raising to benefit the new building. Maurice Francis Egan published his book Prelude: An Elegent Volume of Poems and donated the royalties to the building fund. The entire University administration and community engaged in fund raising throughout the summer of 1879 to replace the Main Building. 284x284px The university took action by selecting, out of 30 competitors, a new design by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, who drew the new plans by May 10. Architect Edbrooke, Brother Charles Borromeo (Patrick) Harding, C.S.C, and mathematics professor William Ivers marked off the dimensions of the construction on the day of the groundbreaking ceremony, May 17, and the first stone for the foundation was laid on the 19th. Railcars full of bricks arrived continuously to town and were brought to campus in a steady stream of wagons. By May 31, twenty-six stonemasons and bricklayers were working with their support crews on the walls of the new building. The construction required about 300 veteran tradesmen, including 156 skilled stonemasons and bricklayers. This exceeded the number of experienced workers in the South Bend area, and was also scarce in Chicago because of the rebuilding effort due to the great fire in October 1871. Hence, skilled workmen were brought into South Bend from great distances. The construction was very rapid due to the zeal of workers and volunteers. By June 21, the first story was completed, and by June 28, they completed the second. The Fourth of July saw the completion of the third. The building was completed before the fall semester of 1879. Fifty-six bricklayers and 4.35 million bricks were necessary to complete it, and once finished it stood 187 feet tall. The building also required 300 tons of cut limestone. The halls were wide and it was considered hygienic, since they had installed a ventilating system unequalled in any public building in America at the time. The Golden Dome was the last thing to be finished, with the iron framework, the panels and the columns supporting the dome, being added during the summer of 1882 and the dome itself was finished in September. The statue of Mary atop the dome weighs 4,400 pounds and stands 18 feet 7 inches tall. It was a gift from the sisters, students, and alumnae of adjacent Saint Mary's College, Notre Dame's sister school. It replicates the pose of the statue of Mary on the Column of the Immaculate Conception in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, erected under Pius IX. It was designed by Chicago artist Giovanni Meli. The statue arrived on campus in July 1880 to replace the one that was destroyed in the fire. The cast-iron statue sat on the rebuilt front porch of the new Main Building for two years while the new dome was completed. The $1 million rebuilding project had left the university in debt. University founder Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., wanted to gild the dome in real gold, but the Holy Cross community's Council of Administration for Notre Dame deemed it too great an extravagance. The standoff lasted into 1886, when Father Sorin used his position as superior general of the community to name himself to the committee and asked to be its chairman. He then refused to come to the meetings so that the other members could not legally conduct its business, even moving to temporary quarters at Saint Mary's and refusing to return. When University business halted, the committee relented and Father Sorin got his Golden Dome and statue. The first project cost $2,000, while the 10th gilding of the dome in 2005 cost $300,000. Architecture The building's style has been described as follows: > Edbrooke called the finished product ‚Äòmodern Gothic‚Äô; a later University > Architect, Francis Kervick, referred to the Victorian monument as 'an > eclectic and somewhat na√Øve combination of pointed windows, medieval > moldings and classical columns.' Others have dubbed the buildings‚Äô riot of > turrets, gables, angles, corners, and oversized dome and rotunda as pure and > simple 'modern Sorin'. =Interior= The halls are decorated by portraits of the presidents of the university. The lower level hosts a gallery dedicated to the Laetare Medal awardees and the Wall of Honor adorned by plaques dedicated to notable people awarded for their service to the university. The building also houses the Columbus murals, a group of large paintings by Italian painter and Notre Dame professor Luigi Gregori, depicting the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus. Gregori also painted with figures representing Religion, Philosophy, Science, History, Fame, Poetry and Music. Usage and traditions The building is the location of many administrative offices of the university, including that of the president, Office of Admissions, and various other offices and services of the university. Additionally, it has classrooms and meeting rooms. In campus lore, if a student ascended the front steps of the Main Building before graduation, that student was doomed never to graduate. This legend stems from traditionalist smoking rituals. Students were not deemed worthy to climb the steps and smoke with their professors until they received their degrees and were educational equals. Main building is also used as the venue for \\"Dome Dances,\\" which are dances awarded to residence halls who have been given the title of Hall of the Year. These dances take place on the second floor of main building, underneath the dome itself which makes them a coveted event for students to attend.

Sir Charles Bennet Lawes- Wittewronge, 2nd Baronet (3 October 1843 ‚Äì 6 October 1911) was an English rower, athlete and sculptor. He exhibited twelve works at the Royal Academy. Life Lawes was born at Teignmouth, Devon, the only son of Sir John Lawes of Rothamsted Manor, Hertfordhire. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he won the Colquhoun Sculls in 1862 and won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta in 1863.Henley Royal Regatta Results of Final Races 1839-1939 He excelled in the university distance running events and received an athletics Blue in 1864 for the mile at the Inter University sports, which he won again in 1865. He was a rowing Blue in 1865 when he stroked the losing Cambridge crew in the Boat Race but was in the winning crew of the Ladies' Challenge Plate at Henley. He was beaten by Edward Michell in the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 1865, but won the Wingfield Sculls beating Walter Bradford Woodgate.Wingfield Sculls Record of Races In 1865 he was the Amateur Athletics Club champion for the mile. Lawes decided to become a sculptor, and began his training in London under John Henry Foley RA. In 1869 he studied under Hugo Hagen in Berlin. He rented a studio in Chelsea, and in 1872, he exhibited his first work at the Royal Academy, Girl at the Stream. In 1878 he won an honourable mention at the Paris Universal Exhibition. He also exhibited his Daphne at the Royal Academy in 1880 and The Panther in 1881.Community Archives The RBS Archive Newsletter September 2008 - Issue No. 12 Lawes also carried out work for the scientific side of the Lawes Agricultural Trust, founded by his father, and became its chairman. In 1882 Lawes was involved in a libel case after he had imputed in the magazine Vanity Fair and elsewhere that another sculptor, Richard Claude Belt, was dishonest for taking credit for work done by someone else. The long trial, the last to be heard by the High Court of Justice in Westminster Hall, occupied the court for 43 sittings and excited much public interest at the time. The question at issue was how much a sculptor may be aided by others in work to which he attaches his name. Eventually the case was decided against Lawes, and Belt was awarded ¬£5,000 damages. In 1898, at age fifty-five, Lawes took up cycle racing and held the National Cycling Union amateur record for twenty-five miles, covering it in 51 minutes 15.8 seconds. Lawes succeeded his father as Baronet on 31 August 1900, and in 1902 he assumed for himself and his heirs by Royal Licence the additional surname (and arms) of Wittewronge. He was one of the founders of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1902 and became its second president. In 1902, Lawes helped judge the world's first major bodybuilding competition. Organized by famed strongman Eugen Sandow, the event was held in London's Royal Albert Hall, and was judged by Lawes, Sandow and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1906 Lawes-Wittewronge executed The Death of Dirce, a bronze sculptural group based on the Farnese Bull, a classical work depicting the same subject. This was followed by a colossal marble version, exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition in 1908, at the same time as the bronze was being exhibited at the Royal Academy. The marble is now in the grounds at Rothamsted. In 1911, after the sculptor's death, a plaster version was exhibited at the International Fine Arts Exhibition in Rome. That same year his widow offered the bronze to the National Gallery of British Art (later the Tate Gallery). Too large to be satisfactorily displayed indoors, it was installed on the terrace to the left of the building's entrance, where it still stands. Family Lawes married Marie Amelie Rose on 8 April 1869. Their only child, John, succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death at Rothamsted at the age of 68, after an operation for appendicitis.

He was also a poet and a writer. A member of the Lombard nobility, Bertharius as a young man made a pilgrimage to Monte Cassino at the time of the abbacy of Bassacius and decided as a result to become a monk. He became abbot in 856, succeeding Bassacius in that position.Herbert Bloch, Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages (Published by Harvard University Press, 1988), 268. He became abbot at a critical time, in which Muslim incursions threatened central and southern Italy. The basilicas extra muros of Rome had been sacked in 846 AD. Bertharius fortified the abbey with massive walls and towers between 856 and 873, while Louis II of Italy conducted various expeditions against the Muslim forces, beating them back temporarily. Bertharius founded the city that he named Eulogimenopoli, later renamed San Germano, and today called Cassino. Bertharius promoted the study of texts and embellished the abbatial church with precious furnishings. He established a new monastery for women at Teano and maintained good relations with the city of Capua. In 873, Muslim raids in Campania and Latium resumed, and a band of raiders paid by the Duke of Naples, Athanasius, established a base in the Apennines in 882. They burned the abbey of San Vincenzo al Volturno, killing some of the monks there, and on September 4, 882, raiders attacked Monte Cassino, burning and destroying it. Bertharius and the monks managed to escape, finding refuge at the foot of the mountain of Monte Cassino, in the monastery of San Salvatore. Angelarius, a prior of Monte Cassino, took most of the monks to Teano. However, Bertharius remained at Monte Cassino. In 883, the monastery was again attacked, and Bertharius was killed along with some other monks at the altar of St. Martin on October 22 of that year in the church of Saint Salvator at the foot of the hill.Herbert Bloch, Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages (Published by Harvard University Press, 1988), 5.Herbert Bloch, Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages (Published by Harvard University Press, 1988), 684. Bertharius was succeeded by Angelarius, who rebuilt the church of St. Salvator (later named St. Germanus).Herbert Bloch, Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages (Published by Harvard University Press, 1988), 290. Veneration Bertharius‚Äô body was immediately translated to Monte Cassino and in 1486 moved to the abbatial church there, in front of the tombs of Saints Benedict and Scholastica. In 1514, a chapel was dedicated in his honor; his body was placed under the altar. Various artistic depictions of Bertharius were made during succeeding centuries, but these were lost during the Battle of Monte Cassino in World War II. His cult was confirmed on August 26, 1727, by Pope Benedict XIII. He is also venerated in the Orthodox Church, his feast day being October 22.

His most notable works are an imitation of Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope and a translation of the first two sections of Night-Thoughts by Edward Young. They witness to the pre-Romantic sensibility of the 18th century, as also seen in the works of Rousseau, Diderot and Pr√©vost. He also naturalized Ovid's term. Heroides, as 'h√©ro√Ødes', imaginary poetic letters by famous people. The relatively small size of his ≈ìuvre is attributed by some to his fragile health (he died aged only 43) and by others to proverbial laziness. Life and workEarly life= Charles-Pierre Colardeau was the son of Charles Colardeau, collector of salt warehouse of Janville and his wife Jeanne Regnard. Orphaned at age 13, he was raised by his maternal uncle, pastor of Pithiviers who sent him to the college of Meung-sur- Loire to complete the humanities that he had begun with the Jesuits of Orl√©ans. Then he came to his philosophy at College of Beauvais in Paris and then returned to Pithiviers. His uncle had got him a position as a secretary to a lawyer at the Parliament of Paris, with the intention to prepare for the study of law and the legal profession. Colardeau then returned to the capital in 1753 but remained there for only a short time as his health faltered and he had to return to Pithiviers where he indulged his penchant for poetry, translated into verse fragments of holy scripture, undertook the writing of his tragedies Nicephore and Astarb√©, the subject of the first having been taken from the Bible and that of the second from the Aventures de T√©l√©maque (Adventures of Telemachus) of F√©nelon . =Literary career= In 1755, with the recall of the Parliaments, Colardeau was able to return to Paris where he finished his tragedy Astarb√© which he read to the Com√©diens-Fran√ßais in July 1756. Before the welcome given to his work, he decided to abandon the law to devote himself entirely to his literary career. Astarb√© however, was not performed immediately, and the assassination of Damiens led Colardeau to withdraw it, however, he composed an imitation of Pope's Eloisa to Abelard, which was a great success and made him immediately famous. Astarb√© was eventually performed in April 1758 and was well received. The same year, continuing in the vein of verse epistles, Colardeau produced an h√©ro√Øde entitled Armide √† Renaud. His second tragedy, Calista, represented in 1760, had some success through the talent of Mademoiselle Clairon but provoked critical comments, particularly because of its scabrous subject (rape). Colardeau undertook a translation into French of Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, but he destroyed the manuscript before his death. He then tried his hand at a translation of Virgil's Aeneid which he abandoned when he heard that Father Delille was working on an identical project. In 1762, his poem Patriotism brought him to the attention of the Duc de Choiseul and earned him a biting satire to which he responded in his Ep√Ætre √† Minette (Letter to Minette). Returned to Pithiviers in 1766, he wrote a comedy in five acts and in verse, Les perfidies √† la mode, which was not performed. In 1770, he put into verse the first two parts of Edward Young's Night-Thoughts, whose French translation had just been published. In 1772 he published a Temple de Gnide composed a decade earlier, adapted from Montesquieu, as the poem by Nicolas- Germain L√©onard appeared shortly before. In 1774 he published his Ep√Ætre √† M. Duhamel de Denainvilliers (Letter to Mr. Duhamel Denainvilliers) on the charms of the countryside and a descriptive poem Les Hommes de Prom√©th√©e (The Men of Prometheus) which describes the awakening of romantic love in the first two human beings. =Family life= The M√©moires Secrets pour servir √† l'histoire de la R√©publique des Lettres en FranceLondon, 1784, vol.9, p. 81 attributed the death of the writer to a venereal disease contracted during a fleeting relationship with a \\"courtesan ungrateful and treacherous\\". The siren that M√©moires ... designate as Demoiselle Verri√®res would be Marie Rinteau (1730‚Äì1775) called Marie Verri√®res or De Verri√®res . Marie and her sister had a welcoming house at Auteuil and provided a beautiful theatre.Gaston Maugras Les Demoiselles de Verri√®res Paris 1890. A liaison with Maurice de Saxe produced a girl born in 1748, Aurore, who became the grandmother of George Sand.During the last years of his life, Maurice had an affair with a French lady, Marie Rinteau de Verri√®res, who at that time was only eighteen years old. In 1748 she gave birth to a daughter, the last of Maurice's several illegitimate children. She was called Maria Aurora (in French: Marie Aurore) after her grandmother. During the first year of her life, she bore the surname de la Riviere, until her father, shortly before his own death, recognized her as his daughter and gave her the surname de Saxe. By her second marriage with Claude Dupin de Franceuil, Marie Aurore was the grandmother of Amandine Lucile Aurore Dupin, who later became famous as the writer George Sand. Marie was unable to make provisions for her education and the Dauphine took Aurore from her mother to be educated in a convent: after the death of Marshal Saxe (1750) Marie's name is associated in the chronicles of the time with a number of gentlemen among whom there is the enduring presence of Denis Joseph Lalive d'Epinay, from a family of fermiers g√©n√©raux, husband of Louise d'Epinay (who was a lover of Louis Dupin Francueil Aurore, future husband and grandfather of George Sand). The romance of Marie with Colardeau‚Äîa penniless poet‚Äîwas an all too brief interlude, and poor Charles-Pierre was first requested \\"to leave for two years\\" to make way for a richer protector and then finally returned to his desk. The chronicle of M√©moires ... for the year of his death informs us that, once convinced of his disgrace, Charles-Pierre circulated in Paris a \\"bloody satire\\" in which Marie was cruelly treated. Colardeau lived for several years up to his death‚Äîas did many penniless writers of his time‚Äîin the house of an aristocrat, the Marquise de Vi√©ville, of whom the M√©moires ... say \\"she was a woman of wit and philosophy, adding that \\"the rumor was that she had married or would marry him (Colardeau)\\". It seems that the marquise fought hard to get her poet made a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise but bear in mind that‚Äîagain according to the authors of M√©moires ...‚ÄîColardeau had a reputation in the world of letters for writing very little but to be the best versifier in France. In January 1776, Colardeau succeeded Duc de Saint-Aignan in the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. But he did not even have time to deliver his acceptance speech as he died April 7, 1776, aged only 43 years.

Analysis In analyzing the poem, Robert DiYanni notes that the image of a single falling leaf is a common symbol for loneliness, and that this sense of loneliness is enhanced by the structure of the poem. He writes that the fragmentation of the words \\"illustrates visually the separation that is the primary cause of loneliness\\". The fragmentation of the word loneliness is especially significant, since it highlights the fact that that word contains the word one. In addition, the isolated letter l can initially appear to be the numeral one. It creates the effect that the leaf is still one, or \\"oneliness\\" whole within itself, even after it is isolated from the tree. Robert DiYanni.

There is a vast array of models available today for practical asset and liability modeling and these have been the subject of several research studies. Asset/liability modeling (pension) In 2008, a financial crisis drove the 100 largest corporate pension plans to a record $300 billion loss of funded status.http://hr.cch.com/news/pension/040709.asp In the wake of those losses, many pension plan sponsors reexamined their pension plan asset allocation strategies, to consider risk exposures. A recent study indicates that many corporate defined benefit plans fail to address the full range of risks facing them, especially the ones related to liabilities. Too often, the study says, corporate pensions are distracted by concerns that have nothing to do with the long-term health of the fund.http://www.whymetlife.com/downloads/MetLife_US_PensionRiskBehaviorIndex.pdf Asset/liability modeling is an approach to examining pension risks and allows the sponsor to set informed policies for funding, benefit design and asset allocation. Asset/liability modeling goes beyond the traditional, asset-only analysis of the asset-allocation decision. Traditional asset-only models analyze risk and rewards in terms of investment performance. Asset/liability models take a comprehensive approach to analyze risk and rewards in terms of the overall pension plan impact. An actuary or investment consultant may look at expectations and downside risk measures on the present value of contributions, plan surplus, excess returns (asset return less liability return), asset returns and any number of other variables. The model may consider measures over 5-, 10- or 20-year horizons, as well as quarterly or annual value at risk measures. Pension plans face a variety of liability risks, including price and wage inflation, interest rate, and longevity. While some of these risks materialize slowly over time, others ‚Äì such as interest rate risk ‚Äì are felt with each measurement period. Liabilities are the actuarial present value of future plan cash flows, discounted at current interest rates. Thus, asset/liability management strategies often include bonds and swaps or other derivatives to accomplish some degree of interest rate hedging (immunization, cash flow matching, duration matching, etc.). Such approaches are sometimes called ‚Äúliability-driven investment‚Äù (LDI) strategies. In 2008, plans with such approaches strongly outperformed those with traditional ‚Äútotal return‚Äù seeking investment policies.http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/13052428 Asset/liability studies Successful asset/liability studies: * Increase a plan sponsor‚Äôs understanding of the pension plan‚Äôs current situation and likely future trends * Highlight key asset and liability risks that should be considered * Help establish a cohesive risk-management framework * Analyze surplus return, standard deviation, funding status, contribution requirements and balance-sheet impacts * Consider customized risk measures based on the plan sponsor, plan design and time horizon * Help design an appropriate strategic investment strategy * Provide insight into current market dislocations and practical implications for the near term Historically, most pension plan sponsors conducted comprehensive asset/liability studies every three to five years, or after a significant change in demographics, plan design, funding status, sponsor circumstances, or funding legislation. Recent trends suggest more frequent studies and/or a desire for regular tracking of key asset/liability risk metrics in between formal studies. Additional challenges In the United States, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) introduced stricter standards on pension plans, requiring higher funding targets and larger contributions from plan sponsors. With growing deficits and PPA funding requirements looming large, there is an unprecedented need for asset/liability modeling and overall pension risk management. Asset/liability modeling for individuals Some financial advisors offer Monte Carlo simulation tools aimed at helping individuals plan for retirement. These tools are designed to model the individual‚Äôs likelihood of assets surpassing expenses (liabilities). Proponents of Monte Carlo simulation contend that these tools are valuable because they offer simulation using randomly ordered returns based on a set of reasonable parameters. For example, the tool can model retirement cash flows 500 or 1,000 times, reflecting a range of possible outcomes.http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/905/perspectives/p12.htm Some critics of these tools claim that the consequences of failure are not laid out and argue that these tools are no better than typical retirement tools that use standard assumptions. Recent financial turmoil has fueled the claims of critics who believe that Monte Carlo simulation tools are inaccurate and overly optimistic.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124121875397178921 See also * Net worth * High-net-worth individual ReferencesExternal links * Implementing Asset/Liability Management - A User‚Äôs Guide to ALM, LDI and Other Three-Letter Words, Society of Actuaries * Application of a Linear Regression Model to the Proactive Investment Strategy of a Pension Fund, Society of Actuaries * Beyond Rebalancing: Rethinking long-term asset allocation, J.P.

Sarah's con artist father (Gary Cole) appears, and Chuck and Casey are ordered to use his latest scam to pursue a Saudi sheik with terrorist connections. Plot summaryMain plot= The episode begins with a flashback to 1990 where a young girl is riding her bike, when she is struck by an armored car. When the driver panics and calls for help, a man from another car gets out and says he's a doctor, offering to drive her to the hospital. As he loads her into the car, it is revealed that the girl is Sarah as a child, and that the \\"doctor\\" is her father, who used the distraction of a fake accident to rob the armored car. In the present day, Sarah takes a personal day and is evasive with Chuck as to why. He follows her only to find her meeting with an older man at a fancy restaurant, on whom he flashes. However Chuck's watch gives away his location, and Sarah confronts him. Chuck tries to warn Sarah that her date is dangerous. The man overhears them, including insulting comments made by Chuck, when Sarah introduces him as her father, \\"Jack Burton.\\"\\"Chuck Versus the Cougars\\" The team learns that Jack is in town to meet with Sheik Ahmad, who has terrorist connections. The team is ordered to use Sarah's personal connection to investigate, and locate evidence connecting Ahmad to terrorist activities. Using the cover of dinner, Sarah and Chuck meet with Jack, where he reveals he pulled a scam he calls the \\"Lichtenstein\\", selling a building Jack doesn't own, to Sheik Ahmad. Chuck flashes on Ahmad and his men, who confront Jack and attempt to reclaim their money. Jack involves Sarah in his scheme when she comes to help by identifying her as Lichtenstein's assistant, and when Ahmad threatens to kill them, Chuck defuses the situation by pretending to be Lichtenstein himself. A meeting is set at the Nagamichi office tower, which Jack has identified as the fictional Lichtenstein building, to arrange the hand-over. Beckman orders the team to complete the sale to gain access to Ahmad's accounts as part of their investigation. Unaware of the team's true intentions, Jack sets up the plan ‚Äì Casey will pose as security, while he, Sarah and Chuck (who, as Lichtenstein, only speaks German) complete the transaction. They evacuate the tower and hastily convert it into the \\"Lichtenstein Building.\\" Ahmad's men arrives and the operation nearly fails when he insists on using his own interpreter. Chuck quickly improvises a (horrible) German accent and pretends to be insulted, nearly canceling the deal and prompting Ahmad to agree to the sale. The transaction is completed, and the team escapes just before the scam is revealed. The team realizes that Jack has double-crossed them and made off with everything, at which point Beckman orders Casey to bring him in. Ahmad has gotten to him first, however, and calls Sarah, warning her that he will kill Jack if they don't return the money. Sarah goes alone to try to rescue her father. Meanwhile, when Chuck withdraws money out of his account to help Morgan pay off a debt to Devon, (see below) Chuck discovers that Jack had deposited the entire $10 million to his bank account. He rushes to the exchange site in Morgan's broken-down DeLorean where Sarah is confronting Ahmad and offers to return the money, at the same time fooling the Sheik into entering his bank account for the CIA trace for Casey (who had followed in his Crown Vic). A gunfight breaks out, and Ahmad flees in the broken-down DeLorean, but is caught by the police after Chuck reports the vehicle stolen. With the account information, Ahmad's accounts are frozen, however Beckman still intends to have Jack arrested. Casey does vouch for him, acknowledging that his aid was instrumental in their success, and she agrees to pass the information on to prosecutors. Back at her apartment, Sarah meets with her father one more time to delay him so he can be arrested, where he tells her that he knew Chuck could be trusted, and he made a \\"10 million dollar bet\\" that Chuck loved her. Sarah decides to protect Jack from arrest by sending him for ice cream before he can be caught. As he makes his way out, he runs into Chuck. As the police arrive and is greeted by Sarah, Jack asks Chuck if his daughter is \\"some kind of cop\\" which Chuck confirms; Jack, with a proud smile, admits she \\"turned out pretty good, despite having a lousy father.\\" He ends the conversation by asking Chuck to take care of her. =Buy More= Anna is frustrated with Morgan's immaturity and decides they need to take the next step in their relationship, arranging for them to get an apartment together. However, Morgan is broke. Devon overhears the situation and offers to lend him the money for an apartment, provided he pays him back. When Morgan looks for Anna to tell her, a customer comes in with a used DeLorean for a stereo install and mentions he intends to sell it because the car can make only 22 mph before stalling and needs too much work. Morgan, Jeff and Lester are admiring the car, and Morgan offers to buy it with the money Devon lent him. Devon and Anna both find out. Anna is furious, and Devon threatens to pluck out all of the hair on his body one by one until the loan is repaid. In desperation, Morgan asks Chuck for a loan to pay back Devon. As he goes to withdraw the funds, Chuck discovers the money placed in his account by Jack (see above). Chuck borrows the DeLorean from Morgan and reports the theft to the police when Sheik Ahmad escapes in it. Because the DeLorean was seized by the police, Morgan is able to get his money back, pay off Devon with ten thousand to spare when the police impound his car; Anna is ecstatic that now Morgan has more than enough to afford the apartment. However, Morgan's ability to learn from mistakes is tried again as Jeff and Lester beckon him to the upgrade bay. Morgan, Jeff and Lester are in the upgrade bay when a customer comes in with a Dodge Charger painted like the General Lee from The Dukes of Hazzard. Production \\"Chuck Versus the DeLorean\\" expands more on elements of the back story for Sarah introduced in \\"Chuck Versus the Cougars.\\" In particular, it provides some insight into why her father was arrested during flashbacks in the episode, and also that Sarah was actually a part of his scams. Gary Cole's casting as Sarah's father was announced on September 8, 2008. =Flashes= * Chuck flashes on Jack Burton. * As Ahmad enters the restaurant where Chuck is having dinner with Sarah and her father, he flashes on the group. Reception Gary Cole's appearance was positively received. Although Alan Sepinwall found the premise of the scam thin compared to other caper fare, he greatly enjoyed Cole's performance, particularly his ability to play off Yvonne as well as citing small moments like Jack calling Casey \\"Cop Face\\" and swiping a cigar he stole back only moments after giving it to him. IGN cited Sarah's use of his \\"Jack Burton\\" alias in reference to \\"Chuck Versus the Cougars\\", as well as Cole's ability to fit in with the rest of the cast. The payoff of Jack stealing Chuck's ATM card earlier in the episode was also appreciated, as were the numerous small character moments. IGN rated the episode an 8.2/10. References to popular culture * The scene at the restaurant where Chuck identifies himself as \\"Mr. Lichtenstein\\" is a reference to the film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, where Michael Caine's character pretends to be Dr. Emil Schaufhausen from the Schaufhausen Clinic in Liechtenstein. The use of an employee delivering a message, with Chuck snapping and waving them down, only his arm visible from behind the chair, is taken directly from the film. * References are made to the DeLorean's connection to Back to the Future, while the Dodge Charger is painted to look like the General Lee from The Dukes of Hazzard. * The scenes where Morgan is looking at the DeLorean and the Dodge Charger imitate a similar scene in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. * When Chuck reveals that \\"Lichtenstein\\" can speak English and is insulted by the interpreter's \\"poor\\" German, Casey remarks that he sounds like Col. Klink. Col. Klink was the commander of the POW camp in the series Hogan's Heroes. * Casey stated that Sarah's father had checked into a hotel under the alias \\"Guido Merkens.\\" The actual Merkens played nine seasons in the National Football League with the Houston Oilers, New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles.Guido Merkens (statistics & history) - Pro-Football-Reference.com. * The name of Sarah's father, Jack Burton comes from Kurt Russell's antihero character in John Carpenter's classic action movie Big Trouble in Little China. * The DeLorean Morgan buys stalls out at 22 miles per hour.

A h√©ro√Øde is a term in French literature for a letter in verse, written under the name of a hero or famous author, derived from the Heroides by Ovid. It was invented by Charles-Pierre Colardeau. the h√©ro√Øde is a form of tragedy under the form of epistle as it is not mandatory that the h√©ro√Øde be written under the name of a famous character, and it is not enough either that the epistle is either to be defined under the term. What the h√©ro√Øde consists of is more that the nature of the subject needs to be serious, sad and belong to epic poetry and the elegy. The dramatic action is psychological, the story replaces the dialogue and the reader's imagination must be taken sufficiently to make it able to reconstitute the evolution of the drama to which it is only given the view of one of the characters. According to Marmontel: \\"The poet is both the decorator and engineer, not only must he trace back in his verses the location of the stage, but also reconstitute the action, the movement, in one word everything that would be missed if the poem was dramatic.\\" Making one of the characters of the drama speak, the author must choose the most important of them, and make it express all the feelings related to it, summarize in the character all the importance and consequences of the action. The number of h√©ro√Ødes in French literature is limited. The letters of Heloise and Abelard supplied Beauchamps, Colardeau and Dorat material for several h√©ro√Ødes. Gabrielle d‚ÄôEstr√©es √† Henri IV composed in 1767 by Antoine-Alexandre-Henri Poinsinet, Barthe produced one in his 'Lettre de l‚Äôabb√© de Ranc√©'. The epistle of Dido to Aeneas by Gilbert can also be referred to. The h√©ro√Øde is a style long abandoned. Modern writers, freeing themselves from the constraints enforced on poetry by earlier poetics, also abandoned old didactic modes, such as the elegy, the ode, the dithyramb the stanza and the h√©ro√Øde, letting them fuse in either the meditation or the complaint, only forms under which the poet seems to want to express his thoughts.

However, in week one of the 1999 NFL season, about 12 plays into the game, Fisher tore all three major ligaments in his knee, the MCL, ACL and PCL and missed the rest of the season. The injury occurred when Fisher was attempting to cover Tennessee Titans wide receiver Kevin Dyson. His injury left the Bengals thin at cornerback, having to start Artrell Hawkins and fellow rookie Rodney Heath. Following the injury, many media members claimed that Fisher's career was over. The injury would prove to never allow him to regain full health and he never played another game in the NFL. He was released by the Bengals in 2001. Coaching career Following his release from the Bengals, Fisher was hired as a coaching intern in the player personnel department for the Green Bay Packers. On June 16, 2003, Fisher was hired by the Seattle Seahawks as a scout. Fisher was present at the Mountaineers 2008 pro day, and was impressed by former Mountaineers running back Steve Slaton and safety Ryan Mundy. Fisher left the team after the conclusion of the 2009 season. Fisher now works as the Director of Business Development at Octagon Football.

It was composed in the artistic community of Solentiname and first performed in 1975, its liturgical use being prohibited within a few days. It has been praised by Dorothee S√∂lle for fully overcoming the \\"theological danger of docetism\\".Dorothee S√∂lle (1990), Thinking About God: An Introduction to Theology (London: SCM Press, ), 114‚Äì5. Mej√≠a Godoy was motivated to produce a new Mass by the promulgation of the Sacrosanctum Concilium, which permitted popular and regional music in the liturgy, by the Second Vatican Council. Initially he invited the ideas of other artists but in the end composed the piece himself. Though attended the Colegio Salesiano and aspiring to the priesthood, Mej√≠a Godoy's main influences were Marxist: the recent deaths of warrior Che Guevara and poet Jos√© Leonel Rugama, the creation of an \\"Iglesia Popular\\" (popular church) of youths agitating against the traditional hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church.Zayda Garc√≠a Zeled√≥n, \\"La Misa campesina de Carlos,\\" El Nuevo Diario (Nicaragua: December 2001). =Performance history= The first performance was planned for the Plaza de los Cabros in Ciudad Sandino under the priest Fernando Cardenal, but the Mass was broken up by men of the National Guard. A few days later the Archbishop of Managua, Miguel Obando y Bravo, prohibited its future performance in church. Nevertheless, the Misa Campesina Nicarag√ºense grew in popularity through clandestine celebrations that gradually spread throughout western Nicaragua. The recordings were circulated underground due to their repression by the Somoza dictatorship. Since the triunfo of the Sandinista Liberation Front in July, 1979, the mass has been celebrated openly, though never by the official Catholic hierarchy. =Recordings= The recordings were released on the new ENIGRAC label (Empresa Nicarag√ºense de Grabaciones Culturales) in 1980. The label Mantica-Waid released a CD version in December 2001 CD. The earlier Misa Popular Nicarag√ºense relied heavily on the son nica musical style originally from the Masaya region and popularized on the lower plains of western Nicaragua in the 1960s and 1970s. The Misa Campesina Nicarag√ºense broadened this musical palette to incorporate musical styles from throughout the nation, and in this sense it represents a microcosm of the many cultural regions of Nicaragua.T.M.

He has recorded and released four albums with Animals as Leaders: a self-titled debut, Weightless, The Joy of Motion and their most recent album, The Madness of Many. A guitar virtuoso, Guitar World ranks Abasi at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of all time. Life and careerBackground= Tosin Abasi was born in Washington D.C. to Nigerian immigrants to the United States. His brother, Abdul Abasi, is a former drill sergeant in the United States military and is currently a fashion designer. Abasi is a mainly self-taught guitarist. He first picked up a guitar at his friend's house, simply strumming it and making up basic licks on the spot. At this time he was being exposed to some music through learning the clarinet in elementary school. He later began to rent hair metal guitarists' instructional video tapes from his local music store, saying that some \\"were videos you did not want to be caught watching\\" due to racy material in certain tapes (e.g. women in bikinis). Abasi said that when he decided to learn the guitar, his father was \\"totally liberal about the whole thing and encouraging and proud\\" and in fact, bought him his first guitar. However his mother initially held a more conservative outlook. Tosin said in an interview, ‚ÄúMy mom definitely represents more of the traditional immigrant mentality of education and conventional channels being way more important than a creative endeavor\\". =Early career= He was the guitarist for the Silver Spring, Maryland-based metal band PSI before moving onto join the technical metalcore band Reflux in the early to mid-2000s. During a Reflux show, Prosthetic Records noticed his skill and offered him a record deal as a solo artist. At first, he refused, saying he didn't feel comfortable with his skill level to write his own record. Afterwards, Abasi enrolled at the Atlanta Institute of Music and Media, a for-profit college. After graduating, he contacted Prosthetic Records asking if the offer still held. He then formed his \\"solo\\" project, Animals as Leaders, the name loosely being derived from the book Ishmael. =Success with Animals as Leaders and onward= In 2009, he recorded the first Animals as Leaders release with Misha Mansoor (of Periphery), who produced and recorded the album with Tosin, as well as programming the drums. Javier Reyes and Navene Koperweis were enlisted on rhythm guitar and drums, respectively, after the completion of the album, turning the project into a full touring band. He also toured with the band Born of Osiris as a stand-in guitarist for former member Matt Pantelis whilst they were auditioning for a permanent replacement. In 2011, Tosin started putting together material for a new band, T.R.A.M., consisting of his Animals As Leaders bandmate Javier Reyes, Suicidal Tendencies drummer Eric Moore, and former The Mars Volta wind instrumentalist Adri√°n Terrazas-Gonz√°lez. \\"T.R.A.M.\\" stands for Terrazas, Reyes, Abasi, Moore. In mid-March 2011, T.R.A.M. played their first show at South by Southwest, a multi-day music festival in Austin, Texas. Tosin explained that he formed T.R.A.M. as a trio consisting of himself, Javier and Adrian as an outlet for some ideas he had written which he felt did not fit with Animals as Leaders. Eric Moore was not added into the line-up until the recording phase of the album, and wrote and performed all the drums on the album within a few weeks. Animals as Leaders released their second album, Weightless, on November 8, 2011. Abasi was reportedly meeting with Misha Mansoor again in late 2012, and it was reported that a new Animals as Leaders album was in the works, due to be released in 2013. At NAMM 2013, Tosin Abasi's signature guitar, the Ibanez TAM 100, was revealed. This guitar is based upon the Ibanez RG2228 model, which he had been using for some years, and contains his signature DiMarzio Ionizer pickups. On March 19, 2014, the Animals As Leaders album The Joy of Motion was made available for streaming, via YouTube. On March 24, 2014, the album was released in Europe, March 25 in North America and on March 28 in Australia and New Zealand by Sumerian Records. The album was met with widely positive reviews. In July 2014, Tosin appeared in the first episode of Guitar Power, a web-series sponsored by D'Addario String and Rolling Stone Magazine. As of March 2014, he was on tour with Animals As Leaders. In October 2014, it was revealed that Abasi would join Joe Satriani, Guthrie Govan, and Mike Keneally on the G4 tour in 2015. In April and May 2016, Abasi joined Nuno Bettencourt, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, and Zakk Wylde, as part of the Generation Axe tour. The supergroup later reprised their tour in 2017 in Asia, and North America once more in 2018. Tosin Abasi has started his own guitar brand, Abasi Guitars, which opened in 2017, after leaving Ibanez. The guitars that his company produces are similar in shape to the Ibanez Abasi prototype that Tosin unveiled in late 2016. These models can either be ordered as an 8-string or 6-string guitar. Abasi guitars has also unveiled the Pathos guitar pedal, which is a distortion pedal influenced by Abasi's sound. Influences His favoured guitarists, musicians and bands include Steve Vai, Allan Holdsworth, Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Mike Einziger of Incubus, and Dream Theater.Tosin Abasi playing a .Strandberg* Headless 8-string He is a Transcendental Meditation practitioner.

New South Wales In New South Wales, there is a lieutenant-governor and an administrator, who takes up the duties of the Governor if the governor dies, resigns, or is absent. Since 1872 the office was permanently filled by the Chief Justice of New South Wales but the position may be retained by the chief justice after his/her retirement from the Supreme Court of New South Wales.NSW Governor and Parliament Directory with Lieutenant-Governor If the lieutenant- governor becomes incapacitated while serving in the office of governor, the next most senior judge of the Supreme Court is sworn in as administrator.

He resides on campus with his wife Abby, while he is currently an Associate Professor Emeritus in the Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology.  Brief Biography Education= George W. Chang is the son of a professor. He was born in Long Island, New York, but grew up in New Mexico, just a few blocks away from the campus where his father worked. He pursued his undergraduate degree in chemistry at Princeton, where he lived in the residence halls. George then moved to Berkeley, California, in the 1960s in order to obtain a Ph.D in biochemistry, completing his doctorate degree in 1967. Initially, Chang was a resident of the international student housing facilities known as the International House, or I-House. In 1964, Chang moved into an apartment on the north side of campus and resided in that area until he became a part of the Residential Faculty Program.Noel Gallagher \\"New faculty-in-residence program launched\\", UC Berkeley News, 8/25/2005 =UC Berkeley= In 1970, Chang became part of the faculty in the College of Natural Resources. During the 1980s, he served on the campus's Maslach Commission, which made recommendations on improving undergraduates' time at Berkeley. Chang is currently an Associate Professor Emeritus in the Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, where he has taught for over 30 years. His concentration is food safety. As a food microbiologist, he works on foodborne illness and the microbiological safety of food and water supply. In the late 1980s, Chang discovered that the state-of-the-art method for detecting E. coli held substantial flaws. The new test, produced by Chang, provided accurate results in a day's time, versus three or four days for the century-old coliform test. Chang and the undergraduate researcher became co- inventors on a patent for \\"Colitag\\", and on two patents since.Cathy Cockrell \\"The Teacher is In\\", Letter Home: A Newsletter for Cal Parents, Spring 2001 Chang has taught a seminar class in the past titled \\"The Freshman Experience\\". In the seminar, students pick discussion topics, interview fellow students and share their \\"research\\" findings in the class on topics ranging from dating and homework to gaining the Freshman 15 and trying to avoid parking tickets. He has also taught Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology 113, which focuses on food microbiology.Cathy Cockrell \\"The Teacher is In\\", Letter Home: A Newsletter for Cal Parents, Spring 2001 =Involvement with Student Life= During the 1980s, Chang served on the campus's Maslach Commission, which made recommendations on improving undergraduates' time at Berkeley. Chang has served on numerous committees, including The Chancellor's Commission to Study the University's Responses to a Diversified Student Body, The Undergraduate Affairs Committee, and the Committee on Courses. Chang long has taken his support for undergraduates to the residence halls, first for many years as a frequent participant in residence-hall guest lectures, faculty dinners and other events. He is often asked to speak at Cal Student Orientation programs.\\"Resident Faculty Program\\", UC Berkeley Residential and Student Services Program In the fall of 2005, Chang and his wife Abby moved into the residence halls at the University of California, Berkeley, as a part of the Residential Faculty Program. The program gives free room and board in exchange for eight hours of service a week, and is intended to allow students to better know the faculty.Noel Gallagher \\"New faculty-in-residence program launched\\", UC Berkeley News, 8/25/2005 The couple live in a three-bedroom suite in Towle Hall of Unit 2, located on Haste Street. They are often seen walking together to and from the Crossroads dining commons. Chang traditionally wears a hat of some sort, providing the context for his popular saying \\"If I'm wearing a hat or cap, it's office hours,\\" implying that it is almost always office hours. Chang eats most meals at the dining hall. He keeps an office in the academic center, holds regular office hours and teaches a t'ai chi class on Sundays for his residence hall neighbors.Noel Gallagher \\"New faculty-in-residence program launched\\", UC Berkeley News, 8/25/2005 Chang is the sponsor for the program Papers with the Prof, as well as other random events throughout the school year. He has hosted a martial arts movie night in the past. He, along with Unit 1 live-in faculty member Duncan Williams, have appeared at Crossroads during finals week with free muffin tops to students studying for finals. Chang expresses interest in martial arts films, as well as t'ai chi. Chang is an avid traveler and has visited 47 states in the United States, mostly by Greyhound Bus or rail. He is also a fan of auto mechanics, and collects used police cars from auctions, earning him the nickname \\"Cop Car George\\".Bonnie Azab Powell \\"The secret lives of faculty, part 1: Scuba diving, dressage, ballroom dancing, and more\\", UC Berkeley News, 7/28/2004 Chang encourages as many students and residents as possible to add him as a friend on Facebook. He likes to comment on students' Facebook status updates.  Papers with the Prof  Chang initiated a program in collaboration with one of the dining commons on site at Berkeley entitled \\"Papers with the Prof\\". \\"Papers with Prof\\" is a newspaper discussion group hosted at the Crossroads dining commons. Students and other guests at Crossroads are invited to read, mark-up, and discuss the daily selection of newspaper articles subscribed to by Chang. Such papers include The New York Times, the 'San Jose Mercury News, and the San Francisco Chronicle. It is not uncommon to see Chang and his wife eating and chatting with students either at Crossroads or the Unit 3 dining commons Cafe 3.

The nature of the physical relationship between the sexes is unclear. The worms are hematophagous, even the female, despite being fully enclosed.  Evolution  The notion that Griphobilharzia amoena is the only schistosome found in a cold-blooded animal (crocodile), leads to the hypothesis that perhaps Griphobilharzia amoena and other schistosomes are based in ectothermic archosaurs.Brant, S. V., and Loker, E. S. 2005. Can specialized pathogens colonize distantly related hosts? Schistosome evolution as a case study. Public Library of Science Pathogens 1: 38. It was also predicted that since Griphobilharzia amoena originated in ectotherms and then inhabited endothermic avian species, which is where they exist today. Brant and Loker used endothermy as a key factor in the diversification of schistosomes. However, upon analysis it was discovered that Griphobilharzia amoena is actually more closely related to spirorchiids from freshwater turtles rather than to schistosomes.

It is located west-northwest of Calipatria, at an elevation of 52 feet (16 m) below sea level. Truckhaven is generally north of County Highway S-22, east of the Truckhaven rocks, and west of Salton City. It is bounded on the north by the Torres-Martinez Cahuilla Indian reservation lands. It derives its name from a famous old trade and commerce route pioneered through the area by Doc Beaty and the local ranchers from Borrego Springs out to the old highway running up to Palm Springs. USGS incorporated the road name into the Quad Map for the area. Ditto for the geologic place name and the name for any federal mining, mineral, or energy leases in the area. Currently the most active are geo-thermal leases looking for alternative energy. Much of the old check-board ownership has been consolidated into and umbrella ownership within California State Parks. In the last legislative session, the current a future land use questions were largely answered as the legislature divided the area into two management units. The northernmost one is administered by Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and largely precludes the use of motorized vehicle except street legal and then only for basic access to the canyon floors. The southern portion is administered by Ocotillo Wells State Vehicular Recreation Area (also part of the Park System) which does allow use of motorized vehicles. The southern portion has been widely used a vehicle recreation site for many decades. The area is the northern section of the Borrego Maneuver Area (BMA) administered by the US Navy during and after World War II.

It is native to much of North America. It grows in widely varied habitats from northern Canada to Mexico, but is absent from most of the southeastern United States. It is variable in appearance, but generally bears a very narrow, linear inflorescence of spikelets appressed against the stem. There are three subspecies, two very widespread and one which is limited to Greenland. Habitat Slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus) ideally grows in habitats that contain a balanced supply of moisture. The species can also tolerate higher salinity in the soil, making it easier to grow in more diverse habitats.Glover, D. E., et al. \\"Agronomic characteristics and nutritive value of 11 grasses grown with irrigation on a saline soil in southwestern Saskatchewan\\". Canadian Journal of Plant Science. 84(2004): 1037-1050. Studies in soil salinity tolerance have grown in interest due to changing environments and agricultural maintenance. In an experiment performed to assess the growth of slender wheatgrass and stressful salt levels, the results were \\"superior\\". This cultivar can be established in a high-saline habitat over other grass cultivars. \\"Salt-tolerant, perennial forage crops capable of establishing on saline soils will provide protection against erosion, compete with weeds, utilize excess soil moisture, and in some situations provide forage for animals.\\" Acharya, S. N., et al. \\"Salt stress tolerance in native Alberta populations of slender wheatgrass and alpine bluegrass\\". Canadian Journal of Plant Science. 72(1992): 785-792. Along with saline-stress tolerance, slender wheatgrass can also successfully grow in shallow or deep soils and in areas that aren't limited by drift. They can inhabit an area and produce a stable living situation quickly. Generally this cultivar will persist between 5 and 10 years and produce a substantial seed count.Perryman, B. L., Laycock, W.

He was known for playing the Slovenian- style polka. He was nicknamed \\"Milwaukee's polka king\\". Bashell's band was signed to RCA Victor for eight years. In 1987, he became Wisconsin's first resident to receive a National Heritage Fellowship grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Background Bashell was born in Milwaukee to Slovenian parents. He began playing accordion as a 7 year old, and soon began playing it at his family's \\"Bashell's Tavern\\" in the Walker's Point neighborhood. Bashell attended Boys' Tech High School. Musical career Bashell formed his first trio in the 1930s. He played accordion and he hired a drummer and saxophone player. Bashell formed a five-piece band in the late 1940s; their recording of the Slovenian folk song, \\"Zidana Marela,\\" (\\"Silk Umbrella\\") was successful. Bashell said \\"It sold out as fast as they could make the records. Then RCA Victor came along and hired us to make records for them, and we were on the RCA label for almost eight years.\\" RCA wanted Bashell to promote the records on a lengthy national tour, but he refused. He wanted to be close to his wife and children. He later did tours through the \\"polka belt\\" in northern United States from North and South Dakota through New Jersey. Bashell performed at his family's bar for 50 years, as well as house parties, weddings, anniversaries, ballrooms, halls, clubs, bars, and other community-based events in Milwaukee. His albums sold around the United States and worldwide. Bashell was a trustee in the Wisconsin Polka Hall of Fame in the 2000s.

Life before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Capron was born in 1846 to Harriet and Erastus A. Capron. 1847 brought the death of Erastus in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Upon reaching age, Allyn was nominated by a U.S. Congressman to enroll, like his father before him, into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He was sworn in as a cadet on September 1, 1863 and graduated June 17, 1867. Upon graduating from the Academy, Capron was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant of the 1st Artillery Regiment. He held a variety of assignments on the east coast until he was promoted to 1st lieutenant on August 19, 1873. He was promoted to captain on December 4, 1888 and was assigned as commander of Battery E, 1st Artillery Regiment. He served at the Presidio of San Francisco until May 1890 when Battery E was reassigned to Fort Douglas near Salt Lake City, Utah. He served in the Sioux Wars from November 1890 to January 1891, for which he received official commendation in 1891Headquarters of the Army, Adjutant General's Office, General Orders Number 100, Dec. 17 1891, p. 3. and in times of peace in California, Utah, Illinois, Virginia, and Florida,Callum, George W., Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, since its establishment in 1802 until the U.S. went to war with Spain in 1898. Capron commanded Battery E at the Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota on December 29, 1890. The battery's four Hotchkiss breech-loading rifles (Model 1875) are frequently cited as major factor in the high casualties among the Lakotas. (Native-American casualties in the battle are generally estimated to have been about 90 men and 210 women and children killed and 50 others wounded out of an estimated 350 present at the battle.) Capron was on sick leave from May to July 1891 and rejoined his battery at Fort Riley, Kansas where he served until the battery was reassigned to Fort Sheridan, Illinois in September where it assisted in quelling the railroad strike riots. Capron remained at Fort Sheridan until October 1896. In 1892 the battery participated in the dedicatory ceremonies of the Chicago World's Fair. In October 1896 the battery was reassigned to Washington Barracks (later renamed Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. In April 1898, following the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, the battery was sent to Tampa, Florida where it prepared for the upcoming invasion of Cuba. Capron and Battery E accompanied Major General William R. Shafter's V Corps when it landed in Cuba in June. Capron's battery supported the Major General Lawton's division's attack on the Spanish at El Caney the morning of 1 July 1898 which was launched as a supporting attack to pin Spanish forces at El Caney and to keep them from coming to the aid of the Spanish under fire of the main attack on San Juan Heights. Capron's son, Captain Allyn Kissam Capron, was a troop commander of the Rough Riders. During an early battle, the younger Capron was killed. Capron's battery arrived at the front soon and the captain commanded his artillerymen throughout the Siege of Santiago. However, Capron contracted typhoid fever during the campaign and obtained leave of absence which started on August 26, 1898. He died of his ailment near his home at Fort Myer, Virginia on September 17, 1898. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Memberships and awards Capron was a hereditary member of the Aztec Club of 1847 by right of his father's service in the Mexican War. Capron received two Silver Citation Stars of gallantry in action (one for the Sioux Campaign of 1890 to 1891 and the other for service in Cuba. In 1932, Silver Citation Stars was converted to the Silver Star decoration. He was posthumously eligible for the Civil War Campaign Medal, Indian Campaign Medal and Spanish Campaign Medal.

Siam area with Baiyoke Tower II visible in the background. Siam (, , ) is an area in the Pathum Wan District of Bangkok. It is a de facto district/neighborhood that consists of roughly of the Thai Royal Family's estate, of which is the Sra Pathum Palace; the remaining , formerly home to the Siam Intercontinental Hotel and its royal gardens, are leased by the Crown Property Bureau to several shopping complexes on either side of Rama I Road. Though no district of Bangkok by the name \\"Siam\\" legally exists, local Thais refer to this area as such, and consider it to be the very heart of Bangkok. Siam is connected to the adjacent Ratchaprasong area via a number of footbridges. History During the fourth reign of the present Thai dynasty (1851‚Äì1868), King Mongkut ordered the construction of a small palace for royal recreation in this area. The palace was built, and he named it \\"Pathumwan Palace,\\" meaning \\"Lotus Palace\\". The Siam area was also the site of the nation's first airport. When Don Mueang Airport opened in 1914, the land was freed, and inherited by Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkhla, the father of the king Bhumibol Adulyadej.2bangkok.com:Bangkok's Crucible of Construction The prince ordered the construction of the Sa Pathum Palace (\\"Lotus Pond Palace\\"). Sra Pathum Palace is on of the royal estate's . The palace hosted the weddings of the Prince Mahidol Adulyadej and the Princess Mother Srinagarindra (n√©e Sangwan Talapat) in September 1920, and the current king and queen on 28 April 1950. The late Princess Mother formerly lived at the palace. It was renovated to serve as the residence of the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. At one time, the remaining were leased to the former Siam Intercontinental Hotel with its gardens. The walls of the hotel were shared on one side with the palace, and the other with Wat Pathum Wanaram, a temple that was built over a hundred years ago. On 11 December 1964 at exactly 10:00, the hour designated by the royal astrologer as being auspicious, the late princess mother unveiled the foundation stone of the hotel. The Siam Intercontinental was one of the first international hotels in Bangkok. Naming Places and companies bearing a name with reference to the \\"Siam\\" neighborhood began with the Siam Intercontinental Hotel in 1964, followed by Siam Square in 1965, Siam Theater in 1967, Siam Bowl and Siam Center in 1973, Siam Discovery in 1997, and Siam Station, the focal point of the BTS Skytrain, in 1999. Following the demolition of the Siam Intercontinental Hotel, the Siam Paragon was constructed in 2005 and Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok opened on the same grounds in 2010. Among companies bearing a similar name, Siam Piwat was the developer of the Siam Center. Siam Cement, however, refers to the Siam Cement Public Company Limited or SCG, the largest cement company in Thailand.

He married, enlisted as private in 1890, and rose rapidly through the ranks as: * Private, Corporal and Sergeant, 4th U.S. Cavalry, 20 Oct 1890‚Äì1893 * Second Lieutenant, 5th U.S. Infantry, 7 Oct 1893 * Transferred to 7th Cavalry, 30 Nov 1894, became Lieutenant * Captain. 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, 10 May 1898 When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, Capron raised a troop of Rough Riders from the Old West (now Oklahoma) to serve as volunteer cavalry in Cuba. Theodore Roosevelt later wrote of Capron:  Battle and death  General William R. Shafter's corps of American soldiers arrived in Cuba after the declarations of war in 1898. Capron's regiment was commanded by Colonel Leonard Wood and Lieutenant Colonel (later President) Theodore Roosevelt. Colonel Wood granted Capron's request to lead the vanguard, ordering Capron to take his advance guard up a hill at Las Guasimas. The forward unit of Capron's troop, commanded by Sergeant Hamilton Fish II, ran into Spanish gunfire on the hill. Capron rode up and found a dead Cuban scout and Sergeant Fish lying in the middle of the road. Bringing up his troops and leading them in action, Capron lay down to fire at the Spanish soldiers and was shot through the space between the left shoulder and neck with the bullet passing through the lungs and exiting out the right area in the waist. Brought to the rear by a Rough Rider, Capron died. He was highly praised by his commanders, including Roosevelt and was awarded a posthumous Silver Star in 1925. His widow Lillian received the decoration.

For six years it hosted the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, a match play tournament on the PGA Tour and the European Tour in late February. The club was known as Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, carrying co-branding from Ritz-Carlton, which operates the hotel facilities at the club, from its opening until 2012; however the co- branding was removed before the 2013 event for unknown reasons. Designed by Jack Nicklaus, the course holds the distinction for being the longest venue in PGA Tour history at ; the average elevation is approximately above sea level. The club boasts the designation as a Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course with 27 holes. In an effort to preserve and protect the surrounding lush desert, club makes use of numerous \\"green\\" technologies. Efforts include everything from using reclaimed water for the courses and landscaping to preservation of natural washes as havens for wildlife. The course's green complexes were heavily criticized by players during the 2009 event, the first to be played on the course, due to their subtleties and the effects of various natural landforms on the pull of the breaks. This led to several top names demanding the reconfiguration of the greens, including Tiger Woods suggesting that Dove Mountain \\"blow up\\" the putting surfaces. This eventually led to a massive renovation project after the tournament, completed in time for the 2010 event. However, scorn from players continued, with the course consistently ranking near the bottom on the PGA Tour's annual player poll ranking tour venues. Each year, one or two top players routinely skipped the event. This issue came to a head in 2014, when Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott (three of the top four in the world rankings) all chose not to enter, with Scott in particular saying he would be more likely to play if the event were staged at a different course.https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2014/2/14/5410716/2014-wgc-accenture- match-play-bracket-tiger-woods This was the final edition in Arizona; it moved to San Francisco for 2015, then to Austin, Texas, in 2016.

As a player, he won the Chinese league and Cup with Shanghai Shenhua before ending his career with Shanghai COSCO Huili. After retiring, he would immediately go into management with Shanghai COSCO Huili who he coached for seven seasons before joining Chinese League Two club Shanghai Zobon followed by Shanghai Shenxin. Playing careerClub career= Cheng Yaodong started his football career with Shanghai in 1987 when they were originally a semi-professional football team. Predominantly used as a defender he would gradually establish himself within the Shanghai team for several seasons and would also see Shanghai become a professional football team in 1994 when they renamed themselves as Shanghai Shenhua. In the 1995 league season Cheng Yaodong would help Shanghai win the second fully professional league title. His loyalty to Shanghai would see him named as their captain by the 1998 league season and would win the 1998 Chinese FA Cup, however despite playing for Shenhua through the majority of his football career Cheng could not win more honours with the club. Nearing the end of his football career he would play for second-tier team Shanghai COSCO Huili and help them win the division title and promotion to the top tier in the 2001 league season. =International career= Cheng Yaodong's greatest international achievement came when he would be called into the Chinese squad to play in the 1992 AFC Asian Cup, which saw China come third in the tournament. Though he was squad player throughout his international career he did play in the tournament against Japan on November 6, 1992 in a 3-2 defeat. Management career Nearing the end of his football career Cheng Yaodong was offered the chance to manage Shanghai COSCO Huili during the 2003 league season where he replaced Claude Le Roy and surprised many when he was able to steer them second in the league in his debut season and only one point off from the league title. The following season would see the club finish third within the league, however despite this the club could not continue to financially compete with local rivals Shanghai Shenhua and by the 2006 league season the club would move to Xi'an, Shaanxi and eventually change their name to Shaanxi Chanba. While Cheng would move with the club he was unable to replicate the same success he initially had and with the club being prudent in their spending he was only able to guide the club into mid-table positions for the next several seasons. This was halted for a short time when he guided the club to fifth in the 2008 league season, however on 28 August 2009, he surprisingly resigned after a 1-0 away win against the past Shanghai derby rivals Shanghai Shenhua, citing health problem and desire of studying abroad as reasons. While many among the public and media believed that due to his ties towards Shenhua, Cheng was seeking the possibility of replacing their coach Jia Xiuquan, however Shenhua decided to go with the experienced manager Miroslav Bla≈æeviƒá and Cheng would return to Shanghai with third-tier club Shanghai Zobon at the beginning of the 2011 league season.

The company began in 1968, manufacturing and exporting enduro motorcycles, mini-bikes and go-karts. Today they continue in the same genre, though the names have changed to dual- sport and motard (supermoto), and they have returned to the US market in 2016, as Fantic USA Inc. Fantic launched in 2015 also new models of electric bikes, the Fat Bike. and has now a complete line of eMTB and commuter electric bikes. Fantic began exporting to the United Kingdom in 1972, as part of a wave of manufacturers who took advantage of \\"sixteener laws,\\" legislation that forbade sixteen-year-old motorcyclists from riding motorcycles up to 250 cc, as they had been used to. As a result, European and Japananese manufacturers exported their sporty and lightweight below-50cc engines, which had been common in Europe, to England also. Fantic produced a \\"sensational chopper moped\\" and a TI (\\"Tourismo Internazionale),\\" both of which became very popular quickly, P. 5-10. with the reputation of being some of the fastest mopeds on the market, going as fast as 70 mph. In the 1980s, Fantic enjoyed success in the Observed trials world championships, taking three titles as well as seven wins at the prestigious Scottish Six Days Trial. The Fantic Motor motorcycles were first imported into the U.K. in 1972 by Barron Eurotrade Ltd whose headquarters were based at 51 High Street Hornchurch, Essex, and the initial idea came to form the company and import the Fantic came about because one of the founders saw the 50cc 'Chopper' model publicised in an American motorcycle magazine that his brother in law sent him from the States. The U.K. market of wannabe learner drivers had several other makes of what were classed as Mopeds, (Motor and Pedals), but the Fantic T.I. quickly became a worthy contender with the rapid growth of a dealer network. The six speed gearbox was a strong selling point, and the perky Italian Minarelli 49cc engine proved to be very reliable. Stories of the T.I. model reaching 70 mph were an exaggeration, as only just over 50-55 mph could be achieved, and in the right conditions. However, the 125cc Chopper model could top 80 mph, as Terence Shea found when the model was first demonstrated to him at the Fantic factory in Bellagio, Italy. After a hefty lunch and with the wine flowing, as Terence Shea recalls, he test rode the new 125cc chopper model, reaching a top speed . The chopper model was the original inspiration which the new U.K. importer saw as very special and distinct for a niche market, and fame grew. Part of the original marketing and advertising included a Fantic 125cc chopper model to be given to the then top comedian Dick Emery of the 'Oh, you are awful, but I like you' fame. There were many photos of Dick Emery with Terry Shea and Frank Harris of the U.K. importer, and one was blown up very large which showed Terence Shea standing next to the 'bike with his hand on the handlebars with Dick Emery sitting on it. Another popular model was the 125cc Caballero was for on/off road, which was for a different sector of the market. The market for these types of Mopeds only lasted a handful of years. The official U.K. importers glossy studio photograph of the 125cc Chopper model was taken in London, and Terence Shea and Frank Harris of the Barron Eurotrade importer was taken from Hornchurch to London on a trailer towed by car. There was confusion in central London as to which turn to take at one particular junction on the way to the studio, which resulted in the trailer having to be unhooked and physically turned around in the narrow road and extremely busy area for the correct journey to the studio to be continued, much to the amusement of onlookers. In October 2020, Fantic buys Minarelli from Yamaha.

He was selected as an All- American at the fullback position while playing for Princeton University in both 1890 and 1891. Early years Homans grew up in Englewood, New Jersey, where his father, Sheppard Homans Sr., was prominent in the life insurance business. His father was the founder and president of the Provident Savings Life Assurance Company. All-American at Princeton Homans attended Princeton University. He played fullback for Princeton's varsity football team, taking the place of Knowlton \\"Snake\\" Ames‚Äîwho was considered one of the greatest running backs in the early days of the game. When Homans took over for Ames, one newspaper noted: \\"Sheppard Homans, Jr., of Englewood, N.J., is the man who will fill 'Snake' Ames' position as fullback. He is at times a little slow, but he is a sure drop kicker and a hard punter.\\" Homans later recalled sitting on the sidelines in 1889 and then having his chance to start in 1890: Homans proved to be a capable replacement for Ames, serving as Princeton's fullback from 1890 to 1892. He was selected as an All-American in both 1890 and 1891. A December 1892 profile of the Princeton team said of Homans: \\"Sheppard Homans, the team's full back, is a New Jersey boy and lives at Englewood. He runs and dodges with great skill and is one of 'Old Nassau's' best men. His age is 21, his height 5 ft. 9 in. and his weight 160 pounds.\\" Homans later became friends with the noted sports writer Grantland Rice. When Homans died in 1952, Rice paid tribute to Homans as a legend of the game: Semi-professional football After graduating from Princeton, Homans played semi-professional football for the Tenakill Outing Club. An article from The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1893 noted that Homans' punts and long runs were the features of a 12-0 victory over the Crescent Athletic Club. Tennis and golf champion Homans also became a competitive tennis player and golfer. In 1903, he won the indoor singles tennis championship in New York. And in 1929 he won the senior golf championship in Pinehurst, North Carolina. Family and business career In April 1901, Homans married Loraine Eleanor Vanderpool, daughter of one of Newark's wealthiest citizens, at Trinity Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey. Their son, Gene Homans, was a championship golfer and tennis players in the 1920s and 1930s. Homans later went into the life insurance business and was a partner in Prosser & Homans in New York, general agents for Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In September 1920, a bomb was set off on Wall Street by \\"American anarchist fighters\\" who, prior to the bombing, sent a postcard to Homans that read, \\"Dear Shep: Keep away from Wall Street this Wednesday afternoon. There never was a road that didn't have a turn.\\" Homans was a resident of Englewood, New Jersey throughout his life. He died at a hospital in Charleston, South Carolina.

They were involved in launching the first Islamic state known in East Africa, the Sultanate of Showa in Hararghe, sometime in the ninth century. In the 13th century, Argobba created the ruling Walashma dynasty, which would become leaders of the Sultanate of Ifat and Adal Sultanate. The Argobba and the Harla people seem to have relied on each other in the Islamic period. A power struggle erupted between the Harari dynasty of Abadir Umar ar-Rida and the Walashma dynasty of Argobba throughout the Islamc period until Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi took control of Adal Sultanate by executing the Walashma sultan Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad in the 16th century. In the late sixteenth century, Argobba were involved in several conflicts with the Oromo during the Oromo migrations, and due to the withdrawal of Adal from Ethiopia, came partially under Ethiopian Empire rule losing land rights. Many Argobba were forcibly baptized in Shewa by Menelik II. In the nineteenth century, Emperor Yohannes IV ordered the forced displacement of Argobba for refusing to convert to Christianity. Due to expansions from two dominant ethnic groups, many Argobba speak either Amharic or Oromo in Wollo Province; however, those who self-identify as originally Argobba are substantial in the region. The last remaining villages of a once larger Argobba-speaking territory are ≈†onke and ·π¨olla·∏•a. Under the new government of Ethiopia, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, ushered in the early 90s the Argobba obtained regional political power after launching Argoba Nationality Democratic Organization. Distribution Argobba communities can be found in the Afar, Harari, Amhara, and Oromia Regions, in and along the Great Rift Valley. They include Yimlawo, Gusa, Shonke, Berehet, Khayr Amba, Melka Jilo, Aliyu Amba, Metehara, Shewa Robit, and the surrounding rural villages.\\"Argobba: A language of Ethiopia\\", Ethnologue website (accessed 25 May 2009) Religion Argobba are exclusive adherents to the Muslim faith. They are also widely believed to be the first to accept Islam collectively, in the Horn of Africa and vanguards for early Islamic expansion. The Shonke Argobba reportedly forbid their children from attending school due to the possible unislamic influence, it might have on them. Language The Argobba traditionally speak Argobba, an Ethiopian Semitic language within the Afroasiatic language family. According to Getahun Amare, Argobba is not a dialect of Amharic as previous linguists believed, but a separate language. In some places, Argobba has homogenized with Oromo. In other areas, the people have shifted to neighboring languages for economic reasons. At this time there are only a few areas left where the Argobba are not at least bilingual in Amharic, Oromo or Afar.

The Caigentan () is a circa 1590 text written by the Ming Dynasty scholar and philosopher Hong Zicheng (). This compilation of aphorisms eclectically combines elements from the Three teachings (Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism), and is comparable (Goodrich and Fang 1976:678) with Marcus Aurelius' Meditations or La Rouchefoucauld's Maximes. Title Chinese Caigentan combines cai Ëèú \\"vegetables; greens; (non-staple) food; dish; course (in menu)\\", gen Ê†π \\"roots (of plants); bottom (of mountains)\\", and Ë≠ö \\"talk; conversation; discourse\\". This compound caigen ËèúÊ†π \\"inedible root of a vegetable; cabbage stalk\\" is a literary metaphor meaning \\"bare subsistence\\" (originating in Zhu Xi's Xiaoxue Â∞èÂ≠∏ \\"Minor Learning\\"). The Chinese proverb Jiao de caigen, baishi ke zuo ÂöºÂæóËèúÊ†π, Áôæ‰∫ãÂèØÂÅö (Rohsenow 2002:66) literally means \\"[One who has] chewed vegetable roots [for lack of anything better to eat] can accomplish anything\\", or figuratively \\"One who has gone through hardships can do anything\\". \\"By vegetable roots, food such as turnips, radish, carrots and sweet potatoes is meant\\", says Vos (1993:172). English translations of the Caigentan title range from literal to figurative: *\\"Musings of a Chinese Vegetarian\\" (Isobe 1926) *\\"Discourses on Vegetable Roots\\" (Chao 1959) *\\"The Roots of Wisdom\\" (Wilson 1985) *\\"Discourses on a Simple Life\\" (Vos 1993) *\\"Tending the Roots of Wisdom\\" (White 2000) *\\"Zen of Vegetable Roots\\" (Li and Fu 2002) *\\"Vegetable Roots Discourse\\" (Aitken and Kwok 2006) Isobe clarifies the title as meaning \\"Talks by a man who lives on vegetable roots\\", or more freely \\"Talks by a man who lives a plain and humble life\\". Textual history The history of Caigentan editions is convoluted (see Vos 1993, Aitken and Kwok 2006:165-176). No original text is extant in China, and the earliest printed editions are preserved in Japan. Traditionally, the two received Caigentan versions are identified by whether they list the author Hong's given name Yingming ÊáâÊòé or courtesy name Zicheng Ëá™Ë™†. These two texts have three early prefaces. The first \\"Zicheng version\\" preface is by Yu Kongjian ‰∫éÂ≠îÂÖº, a contemporary friend who calls the author Hong Zicheng. The second and third \\"Yingming version\\" prefaces, dated 1768 and 1794, are by Suichutang zhuren ÈÅÇÂàùÂ†Ç‰∏ª‰∫∫ \\"Suichu Hall Master\\" and Sanshan bingfu Tongli ‰∏âÂ±±ÁóÖÂ§´ÈÄöÁêÜ \\"Three Mountains Invalid Tongli\\". Both Caigentan versions are divided into two ce ÂÜä \\"books; volumes\\". The Zicheng version has 360 (or 359) entries, and the Yingming version has 383. The first book is subdivided into four sections, titled Xiushen ‰øÆË∫´ \\"Self-cultivation\\", Yingchou ÊáâÈÖ¨ \\"Social Relations\\", Pingyi Ë©ïË≠∞ \\"Critiques\\", and Xianshi ÈñíÈÅ© \\"Leisure\\"; the second book is titled Gailun Ê¶ÇË´ñ \\"General Comments\\". Besides differing in number and ordering of entries, the Zicheng and Yingming editions also differ in content. \\"The Yingming version shows many more editorial changes and liberties\\", write (Aitken and Kwok 2006:171), and subsequent versions also exhibit \\"editorial excisions and additions\\". \\"Generally speaking \\", say (Goodrich and Fang 1976:678), \\"the first part of his work counsels integrity in office, whereas the second part describes the joys of living in retirement. Its general spirit is that of the \\"Golden Mean\\".\\" Scholarship tentatively dates the Caigentan between 1588 and 1591. Yu Kongjian's undated preface to the Zicheng version (tr. Vos 1991:171) provides internal evidence. It begins, \\"Sending [uninvited] visitors away, I am leading a retired life all by myself in a thatched cottage.\\" The preface further says, \\"One day my friend Hung Tzu-ch'eng appeared with his Ts'ai-ken t'an which he showed to me begging me for a preface.\\" In 1588, the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572‚Äì1620) demoted many scholar-bureaucrats involved in a scandal, including Yu Kongjian who retired to the lower Yangzi River valley, where he and his fellow exile Hong Zicheng lived. In 1591, the Caigentan was first published as an appendix to Gao Lian's Zunsheng Bajian ÈÅµÁîüÂÖ´Á¨∫ \\"Eight Treatises on Nurturing Life\\". Thus, the Caigentan reasonably dates from 1588 to 1591. The classic Caigentan \\"Vegetable Roots Discourse\\" remains popular in the present day. Digital editions are freely available on the Internet, and comic book adaptations are offered in both Japanese manga and Chinese manhua. Contents In terms of traditional Chinese literary genres, the Caigentan is a yulu Ë™ûÈåÑ (lit. \\"recorded sayings\\") \\"quotations; aphorisms\\", a subtype of shanshu ÂñÑÊõ∏ (\\"good book\\") \\"moral-instruction; morality\\" book category. The individual entries are predominantly written in pianwen Èß¢Êñá \\"parallel style\\", an ornate rhythmical prose marked by parallelism or chiasmus. For instance, > Âè£‰πÉÂøÉ‰πãÈñÄ, ÂÆàÂè£‰∏çÂØÜ, Ê¥©Áõ°ÁúüÊ©ü; ÊÑè‰πÉÂøÉ‰πãË∂≥, Èò≤ÊÑè‰∏çÂö¥, Ëµ∞Áõ°ÈÇ™Ëπä. (1:220) > The mouth is the portal of the mind. If not carefully guarded, it leaks > true intents and motives. Feelings are the feet of the mind. If not > carefully watched, they will take you onto all kinds of wayward paths. (tr. > Aitken and Kwok 2006:100) The Caigentan records life lessons from the decadent and corrupt late Ming society, many of which have universal appeal. Take, for example, this warning to partygoers. > Those who pick up their coats to depart at the height of festivity are > admired as adepts who can halt at the precipice. Those who pursue their > night journey after their candle has burned out are ridiculed as ordinary > persons awash in the bitter sea. (2:104, tr. Aitkens and Kowk 2006:147) Referring to the first of the Buddhist Four Noble Truths, Sanskrit dukkha (Chinese ku) \\"suffering; bitterness\\", this kuhai Ëã¶Êµ∑ \\"bitter sea\\" is the Chinese translation of dukkha-samudra \\"sea of bitterness; ocean of suffering\\". Retirement and old age are common themes in the Caigentan. > The sun is setting and the evening clouds are more colorful than ever. The > year is about to end and the oranges and tangerines are all the more > fragrant. Thus noble persons in their old age should all the more enliven > their spirits a hundredfold. (1:11, tr. Aitken and Kwok 2006:91) Translations The Chinese Caigentan has been translated into many languages. Japanese Saikontan translations are the most numerous, with over 26 annotated editions published (Wilson 1985:17). English translations are available from Isobe Yaichiro (1926), William Scott Wilson (1985), Thomas Cleary (1990), Paul White (2000), and Robert Baker Aitken and Daniel W. Y. Kwok (2006). In addition, there are partial translations by Chao Tze-Chiang (1959) and by Lee Siu-Leung and Fu Yiyao (2002). Three annotated editions (White, Aitken and Kwok, and Lee and Fu) include parallel text Chinese. To illustrate the translational range in English, the Caigentan metaphorically compares two traditional Chinese artifacts, the qiqi Êî≤Âô® (lit. \\"leaning/tilting vessel\\") \\"a container designed to overturn when full\\" and the puman Êí≤Êªø (lit. \\"strike [when] full\\") \\"clay coin bank; piggy bank\\".

Thus, the former falls when it is full, while the latter is useful > because it is empty within. Such is the way of the supreme man.

(Wilson 1985) > There is a kind of vessel that tips over when it is full. A piggy bank is > not broken as long as it is empty.

The puman money stays > whole so long as it is not filled up with money.

(White 2000) > A vessel topples because it is too full. A piggy bank is saved from being > shattered for its emptiness. So a true person prefers \\"have-not\\" than > \\"have\\". Rather be incomplete than to be complete. (Lee and Fu 2004) > The qiqi water vessel tips over when it is full. The puman money-saving > vessel is perfect when it is empty. The noble person abides with nothing > rather than with something, and is content with lack rather than with > completeness. (Aitken and Kwok 2006) This qiqi alludes to the ancient Xunzi (28.1, tr. Knoblock 1994:244), where it was a symbolic warning against complacency. When Confucius visited the ancestral temple of Duke Huan of Qi, he saw a \\"vessel that inclined to one side\\", which the caretaker called a you zuo zhi qi ÂÆ•Âùê‰πãÂô® \\"warning vessel that sat on the right\\". Confucius said: \\"I have heard of such a warning vessel; if empty, it inclines; if half full, it is upright, and if completely full, it overturns\\". After watching a demonstration of the vessel's operation, he sighed: \\"Alas! How indeed could there be complete fullness and no overturning!\\" References *Aitken, Robert and Kwok, D.W.Y. 2006.

Early years and background O'Hagan was born a godson of Princess Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth II.

Political career Lord O'Hagan first took his seat in the House of Lords on 5 December 1967,Preamble, Hansard, vol 287, c521, 5 December 1967. and gave his maiden speech whilst he was still a student.University Students' Discontents, Hansard, vol 293, cc716‚Äì830, 19 June 1968. He was appointed an Independent MEP in December 1972, taking his seat on the day Britain began its EEC membership, 1 January 1973. Between 1973 and 1979, British MEPs were not elected, but were appointed from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Since the Labour party was deeply divided over EEC membership, it refused to nominate members to the Parliament. Accordingly, O'Hagan was one of a group of Independents and Liberals appointed instead of the Labour nominations. During this first period as an MEP, O'Hagan tried to introduce the first Bill to allow the European Parliament to be directly elected instead of appointed. On 1 May 1974, he introduced the Bill in the House of Lords, but it was voted down.Sergio Pistone, The Union of European Federalists (Giuffr√© Editore, Rome, 2008) p.211 The 5 June 1975 referendum on British EEC membership settled the question of Britain's position in Europe, and from that point onwards, the Labour party demanded its share of MEP nominations. O'Hagan thus lost his seat on 3 July 1975 after a joint decision by the Conservative and Labour parties to cease appointing Independents and Liberals to the European Parliament. He then joined the Conservative party and became a whip and a frontbench spokesman for the Conservatives in the House of Lords between 1977 and 1979. He was also involved in the Primrose League before its dissolution, serving as its Chancellor from April 1979 to April 1981. In the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, he was returned as MEP for Devon as a Conservative, with 61.8% of the vote and a majority of 86,022. He was then re-elected in 1984, when his vote share dropped to 54.7% and his majority fell to 56,620. At the 1989 European Parliament election he was again re-elected, and although his vote share dropped further to 46.4%, a split in the opposition vote meant that his majority actually increased to 57,298. He remained an MEP until his resignation in March 1994. He had been due to contest the 1994 European Parliament election, fighting the newly-drawn constituency of Devon and East Plymouth, but he resigned three months before the election, citing the collapse of his second marriage, commenting \\"You can't fight an election with your mind on other things.\\"\\"Separate Ways\\", The Times.

Life After his father's death by 1365 Henry and his brothers Boles≈Çaw II (d. 1368) and Wenceslaus (d. 1369) inherited Niemodlin as co-rulers; however, Henry had to wait to the deaths of his brothers to obtain the full government over the whole Duchy. Around 1370 Henry made an arrangement with the Dukes of Opole, Bolko III and W≈Çadys≈Çaw (who was approved by the Emperor Charles IV in February and March 1372): in case of Henry's death without issue, Niemodlin was inherited by the Dukes of Opole. Henry maintained a long-lasting dispute with the Bishop of Wroclaw, Preczlaw of Pogarell, for the possession of the castle J√°nsk√Ω vrch, which only ended with the Bishop's death in 1376. His relations with the new Bishop, Duke Wenceslaus II of Legnica, were correct because he chosen to live in Otmuch√≥w. In 1373 Henry granted a charter to the town of G≈Çog√≥wek, who was greatly favored by him. In 1379 he founded there a Kolegiata, who received the revenues of two villages. By 2 February 1372 Henry married with Katharina (b. ca. February 1353 ‚Äì d. by 17 February 1378), daughter of John Henry, Margrave of Moravia and niece of Emperor Charles IV. The union was childless. Henry died on 14 September 1382 year and was buried in the Kolegiata of St. Bartholom√§us in G≈Çog√≥w. Contrary to the agreement of 1372, after Henry's death, Niemodlin was taken by King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia as an emptied fief, and pretend to given them to Przemys≈Çaw I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn, but this caused the strong opposition of the Dukes of Opole, who claimed his hereditary rights. Only one year later, in 1383, was ruled the final decision over this matter. The Duchy was divided: W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Opole received G≈Çog√≥wek and Prudnik, and Bolko III's sons obtain Niemodlin.

The Rogue River flows generally west for from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill, and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass, and Galice in Josephine County, and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at above sea level, the river loses more than in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. Of the river's total length, , or about 58 percent, is designated as National Wild and Scenic River ‚Äì part on the upper Rogue and part on the lower Rogue. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean.Loy, pp. 162‚Äì63 The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain the mountains south of the Willamette Valley. The Willamette River drains rivers to the north into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon. Boundary Springs to Lost Creek Lake Flowing out of Klamath County and into Douglas County at the headwaters spring, the river runs north for about before leaving the national park and entering the national forest. Crossing under National Forest Development Road (NFD) 9281, also known as Old Diamond Lake Road, the river turns west parallel to the Upper Rogue River Trail, which is on the right. Parallel to the river and slightly north of the trail is Oregon Route 230, also known as the West Diamond Lake Highway. Shortly thereafter, the stream goes over a waterfall, receives Cascade Creek from the right and then Mazama Creek from the left at about river mile (RM) 211 or river kilometer (RK) 340\\\\. Two more waterfalls occur in the next before the stream turns to the south, passes under NFD 4901 just before receiving Minnehaha Creek from the left near Minnehaha Campground. The stream then meanders through Hamaker Meadows and receives Hamaker Creek from the left before passing Hamaker Campground, which is on the right. At this point, the Upper Rogue River Trail crosses the stream on a footbridge and continues parallel to the river along the left bank. Muir Creek enters from the right at Muir Campground, at RM 204 (RK 328). Soon the Rogue receives Hurryon Creek from the left, Meadow and Lost creeks from the right, and National Creek from the left. Shortly thereafter, NFD 6530 crosses the road and so does the Upper Rogue River Trail, which continues parallel to the river on the right bank. About later, the river leaves Douglas County and enters Jackson County near RM 198 (RK 319). The map quads collectively showing the entire river are Pumice Desert West, Hamaker Butte, Union Creek, Prospect North, Whetstone Point, Prospect South, Cascade Gorge, McLeod, Trail, Shady Cove, Eagle Point, Sams Valley, Gold Hill, Rogue River, Grants Pass, Wilderville, Merlin, Galice, Mount Reuben, Bunker Creek, Marial, Agness, Soldier Camp Mountain, Brushy Bald Mountain, Signal Buttes, and Gold Beach, all in Oregon. These maps include river mile (RM) markers from the mouth to RM 211 (RK 346), except for a stretch of between just above Hellgate Canyon to Dulog Riffle above Winkle Bar. The upper Rogue plunges into Rogue River Gorge at Union Creek, Oregon.Soon the river receives Wizard and Copeland creeks from the left and passes under Oregon Route 230, which continues roughly parallel to the river along the left bank. Next, Foster and Prairie creeks enter from the left, Bridge, and Brown creeks from the right, and Bybee and Castle creeks from the left. NFD 6510 crosses the river between the latter two creeks, and Route 230 ends shortly thereafter where it meets Oregon Route 62, also known as the Crater Lake Highway.

Between Agness and the coast, the river gradient averages . Discharge Below Natural Bridge on the upper river The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operates five stream gauges along the Rogue River. A gauge downstream of Prospect and from the mouth of the river recorded an average discharge of between 1969 and 2007. Fluctuations caused by a power plant upstream affected the flow as did small diversions for irrigation. The maximum flow recorded at this station was on January 1, 1997. The minimum flow, related to regulation by upstream diversion gates, was on September 29, 1992. Before the period of record for this gauge, the maximum flow since at least 1890, based on flood marks and on records from downstream gauge stations, was on December 22, 1964. The Prospect gauge measures the flow from an area of , which is about 7 percent of the Rogue watershed. At Dodge Bridge near Eagle Point, a gauge recorded an average flow of between 1939 and 1977 and between 1978 and 2007. The flow was regulated by Lost Creek Lake after 1977. The maximum discharge recorded at this station was on December 22, 1964, and the minimum was on February 18, 1977, because of the closure of the Lost Creek dam. Before that, the minimum was on August 6, 14, and 29, 1940, and September 9, 1940. This gauge, northwest of Eagle Point and from the mouth of the river, measures the flow from an area of , about 23 percent of the Rogue watershed. Just below Gold Ray Dam, northwest of Central Point at river mile (RM) 125.8 or river kilometer (RK) 202.5, a gauge recorded an average flow of between 1906 and 1976 and between 1977 and 2007. Starting in 1977, the flow was regulated by Lost Creek Lake and slightly regulated by Fish Lake and Emigrant Lake. Many irrigation diversions operate upstream of this gauge, which measures flow from a drainage area of , about 40 percent of the Rogue watershed. The maximum discharge recorded at this station was on December 23, 1964, and the minimum discharge was on September 19, 1968, a result of regulation. A gauge at Grants Pass, from the river mouth, recorded an average discharge of during the years from 1939 to 1977 and for the years from 1978 through 2007. Maximum flow was on December 23, 1964, and the minimum flow was on January 30, 1961. The drainage area above this gauge was , roughly 48 percent of the Rogue watershed. The average discharge recorded by a gauge north of Agness, upstream of the Illinois River and at RM 29.7 or RK 47.8 was . The maximum discharge during this period was on December 23, 1964, and the minimum discharge was on July 9 and 10, 1968. This was from a drainage basin of , or about 76 percent of the entire Rogue watershed.

At the JKT48's 1st anniversary concert inside the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex on 23 December 2012, Nakagawa was included in Team J together with Takajo and all of the 22 surviving first generation members of JKT48. Nakagawa performed with Team J on the first day of Renai Kinshi Jourei performance at JKT48 Theater, 26 December 2012. Within a year, Nakagawa has appeared in about 20+ TV commercials and several TV dramas in Indonesia. She also got the center position for the JKT48's \\"Fortune Cookie Yang Mencinta\\" (Koisuru Fortune Cookie ÊÅã„Åô„Çã„Éï„Ç©„Éº„ÉÅ„É•„É≥„ÇØ„ÉÉ„Ç≠„Éº, \\"The Fall-in-Love Fortune Cookie\\") MV that was released on 21 August 2013. Nakagawa also showed the other side of herself as a senior member of AKB48 by teaching and guiding her fellow JKT48 colleagues. Her hard effort has made her accepted, famous and loved in the society. On 9 February 2014, AKB48 sub-unit Watarirouka Hashiritai held their last concert and the sub-group finally broke up. On 28 December 2014, she joined a new sub-unit of JKT48 named 4 Gulali and is the first sub-group from JKT48 that was formed. Previously, the officials asked the fans for help to contribute by giving ideas of what will become the project's name with the #NAMAHARUKAPROJECT (Haruka's Project Name) tag on Twitter. Members and costumes for the group were determined and decided by Nakagawa herself. They successfully performed their single \\"Chu Chu Chu Only For You\\" (Kimi Dake ni Chu! Chu! Chu!) And \\"Be Yourself\\" (Jibun Rashisa) at JKT48 3rd Anniversary at Tennis Indoor Senayan, Saturday 27 December 2014. At the JKT48 Concert Show Hour Setlist Best 30 2016 held on 27 February 2016 at Balai Sarbini, Jakarta, Nakagawa announced her graduation from JKT48. Not only graduating from JKT48, because Nakagawa did not want to go back to Japan after graduating from JKT48, she also decided to graduate from the 48 Group. Nakagawa had a farewell concert in Surabaya on 3 June 2016. In a concert titled \\"Wayahe Suroboyo, Rek!\\" Nakagawa has also given a special gift, which is pedaling bicycle for 800 km from Jakarta to Surabaya from 23 May to 3 June 2016.

On 30 December 2016, Nakagawa held her graduation performance on the old Team T's side \\"Holding My Hand\\" and a new Team J until she was graduated from JKT48. She then also received another title as the \\"Senior JKT48\\" (JKT48's senior). After graduating from JKT48, since early January 2017, Nakagawa started her solo career as an talent and actress under the management of JKT48. She is named one of the Top 10 \\"Most Influential Women on Twitter\\" in 2016 and 2017 by the social media analytics firm Brandwatch, placing above Britney Spears, Oprah Winfrey and Alicia Keys. She is the only Japanese person in the list. In 2018, she is appointed as an ambassador of the \\"Commemoration of 60 Years of Diplomatic Relations between Japan ‚Äì Indonesia\\" and also the ambassador of Goodwill between the two countries. She is now famous both in Japan and Indonesia, and is also touted as the most famous Japanese in Indonesia in the modern era.  Personal life  In 2011, Nakagawa revealed that her father is a former professional wrestler, leading fans to speculate that he is Koji Nakagawa of the Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling promotion, despite the latter's denial; it is revealed much later that his name is . On her 27th birthday, Nakagawa revealed on her Instagram account that her parents divorced when she was very young and she and her siblings used to live with their grandmother, and that she has lost contact with her mother. Her sister passed away on 4 May 2019 at the age of 28.

With added costs attributed to finance charges and fiscal mismanagement, the cost in 1872 dollars came to over $800,000 (). The debt incurred by the county was not retired until 1938, when the new courthouse was under construction. The budget for the courthouse project was $26,000. However the initial construction contract was broken and the building was completed with separate contracts at a much higher total cost. In the meantime the county issued a $75,000 bond and quantities of scrip to cover other county obligations that were charged to the courthouse project. With the decline of mining in the county tax assessments fell and the county failed to keep up with interest charges and made no payments at all on principal. An attempted repudiation of the debt in the 1880s failed. Finally, in 1907 the Nevada legislature established a plan to redeem the debt at 65% of the outstanding obligation, with part of the debt undertaken by Clark County, newly created from the southern part of Lincoln County in 1909. The debt was retired in 1938, the same year that the new courthouse was built. The 1872 courthouse was alleged at the time to be unstable and deteriorating. Despite its state of disrepair, the courthouse survived almost forty years of abandonment and was restored in the 1970s to function as a local history museum. The courthouse was designed by T. Dimmock and Thomas Keefe. The two story building is Italianate in style with a brick front and rubble stone masonry sides and rear. Sited on a hill to the rear, the jail is accessible from the second floor. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Background  In the deserts of the Sudan, in 1881 a province of Egypt, a man named Muhammad Ahmad, who claimed to be the long-awaited Mahdi of the Islamic religion, rose up against the Egyptian governors. He and his Arab followers, clad in turbans, skull-caps, white, colorfully patched jibbehs and wielding swords and spears, as well as shields, defeated several Egyptian garrisons. After a short war with Britain, culminating in the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, Egypt had its army officered partly by Englishmen. One of these men, Colonel William Hicks, led an army of 10,000 along the Nile and then into the vast deserts. There, the thirsty square of white-uniformed Egyptians was wiped out by the Mahdi's men, called Dervishes, who now had guns. = Gordon is sent to Khartoum = British Major-General Charles George Gordon, a colorful, experienced soldier who had served many countries besides his own, was sent to Egypt to evacuate the city of Khartoum. On the Nile, it was the base of government for the Sudan and was threatened by the Mahdists. When Gordon and his adjutant, Colonel John Donald Hamill Stewart, reached Khartoum, they realized that the place was quite defensible. Instead of evacuating, Gordon fought. He soon became besieged by the Mahdi and the Arabs. In Britain, although the Government, led by Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, did not want to send troops, the public clamored for it. Finally, General Lord Garnet Wolseley was sent to the Sudan with an ample number of British troops.  The Gordon Relief Expedition  The Columns = General Wolseley decided that, as he was not able to move all of his troops along the Nile and get to Khartoum quickly, that he would send a quick Camel Corps to reinforce Khartoum. It would travel along the shorter route through the desert. The second column, the larger River Column, would relieve the city once the men reached it. The troops were all wearing white sun helmets and some of the River Column wore red tunics. Others of the Relief Expedition wore grey and later khaki. The Desert and River Columns arrived in and set out from Korti in late 1884. The River Column moved out slowly, commanded by Major General William Earle and Brigadier General Henry Brackenbury. They were hampered by all of the different cataracts of the Nile as they marched south. This column was a force of regular infantry, men of the Egyptian Camel Corps, a Highlander regiment, an artillery battery and a small unit of the Eighth Hussars. Along the way, a messenger from Khartoum reached them and secretly told Earle and Brackenbury that Gordon wished them to come quickly. Even further down the river to Khartoum, they received word that the Mahdists were reported near Hamdab. With a force of natives under a Mudir, the River Column marched forward. After finding out that Gordon's aide, Colonel Stewart, had left Khartoum on a mission and had been murdered by a force of Arabs when his steamboat ran aground, the River Column asked the locals to apprehend the murderers or give information about them. After camping and re-organizing at Hamdab, the River Column moved for Kirbekan, where the Dervishes were now reported to be. Once the column made a reconnaissance of Kirbekan village, the British advanced. One group made a diversion, and General Earle himself accompanied this force of Highlanders. The troops attacked, with bagpipes playing, and moved over the 'koppies' to attack the town. As the group led by Earle formed and charged a little hut full of Dervishes, a sergeant said that a man had fallen and that there were quite a few Arabs in the hut. Earle ordered the roof to be set afire, but the resistance inside was heavy. Someone saw the General fall, and it was revealed that Earle had been killed. Despite his loss, the Dervishes gradually gave way, despite a good amount of fighting, and the British took the village. General Brackenbury had by now taken command and Colonel Eyre, one of the senior officers, had been killed, so the Stafford Regiment and some of the Black Watch Highlanders rallied under Brackenbury and another officer was ordered to bring a group up a hill to drive away the rest of the Dervishes. Brackenbury noted that a lone Egyptian soldier had charged as the force's flank guard! However, after the victory, Brackenbury was informed that Khartoum had fallen and Gordon had been killed by the Dervishes. Slowly, the troops marched back up the Nile, with the steamboats helping, and returned to Korti. The Desert Column had been stopped, but a group in steamers had reached Khartoum. Once there, they found the Egyptian flag was missing from Gordon's palace and were fired upon from the town. They were too late. The expedition was over.

The , jockey was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, where Passmore's father, William L. Passmore, was a successful steeplechase jockey and trainer who worked for area horse breeder Bayard Sharp. Passmore's first mount was on May 23, 1948, at the age of 15, one year below the legal minimum, aboard Minneapolis at the now-defunct Jamaica Race Course in Queens, New York.Rasmussen, Frederick N. \\"William J.

His only appearance in the Belmont Stakes was in 1983 when he finished in 14th aboard Dixieland Band. He rode in the Preakness Stakes three times, finishing seventh aboard Galdar in 1954, riding Knight Landing to a seventh-place finish in 1980, and finishing fourth atop Thirty Eight Paces in 1981. In 1981, Passmore became the 32nd jockey in North American racing to win 3,000 races, part of a career in which he won 3,531 races and $23 million in purses out of 29,490 mounts. He retired from racing in 1986, having interrupted his 38-year career in the early 1960s for a year and a half when he worked as a jockey's valet while trying to break out of a slump. During his years as a jockey, Mr. Passmore rode regularly for King T. Leatherbury, Jim McKay, and Art Rooney. Among the notable horses that Passmore rode were Christopher R, Cure the Blues, Jameela, and Twixt.via Associated Press. \\"Bill Passmore, Former Jockey and Racing Steward, Dies at 76\\", The New York Times, May 15, 2009. Accessed May 19, 2009. Racing editor and historian Joseph B. Kelly of the Washington Star described Passmore as having a \\"great sense of pace and a great touch with horses\\" and as a jockey \\"who never seemed to get too excited and was always very calm when aboard a horse.\\" Passmore himself told the Baltimore Sun in 1971 that he would infrequently use a whip during a stretch run, \\"preferring to urge his mount with his hands and body as if he were a part of the horse\\", as \\"the whip isn't going to do any good\\" if the horse is already giving his best. He used his experience as a jockey to serve as a steward for the Maryland Racing Commission, starting from when he left riding in 1986 until his deteriorating health forced him to retire a year before his death. Former racing writer Ross Peddicord of the Baltimore Sun described Passmore's honesty and fairness in his role as a steward making him one of the \\"pillars that perpetuated the reputation of Maryland racing for world-class horsemanship, undisputed class and quality...\\". Passmore was leery of accepting betting suggestions from jockeys who he characterized as \\"the worst touts at the track. I think the track makes a big mistake not installing a mutuel window in the jocks' room.\\" Passmore died at age 76 in his home in Millersville, Maryland, on May 14, 2009, due to complications from emphysema. He had moved to Millersville shortly before his death, having lived in Annapolis, Maryland, for the previous two decades. He is survived by his wife, the former Charlene Levy, as well as two sons, five daughters, and 13 grandchildren.

Totaling more than 1.5 million volumes, the Harvard-Yenching Library has one of the largest collections in East Asian studies outside of Asia.Harvard-Yenching Library Collections The library has been located at 2 Divinity Avenue on the Cambridge campus of Harvard University since around 1957.

The small collection of books that was purchased for this course became Harvard College Library's first acquisitions in any East Asian language. In 1914, two Japanese professors (Masaharu Anesaki, ) came from Tokyo Imperial University to lecture at Harvard. They donated several important sets of Japanese publications on Sinology and Buddhism to the Harvard College Library, thus launching Harvard's Japanese collection. In 1927, Archibald Cary Coolidge, head of Harvard's libraries, asked , then a graduate student at Harvard, to organize and catalog these collections.Eugene W. Wu, \\"The Founding of the Harvard-Yenching Library,\\" Journal of East Asian Libraries 101.1 (1993): 65-69. The library was formally founded in 1928, as the Chinese-Japanese Library of the Harvard- Yenching Institute. Following World War II, the library began collecting more social science publications. The once predominantly humanistic collection evolved into a research library that encompasses East Asian materials in all academic disciplines. A. Kaiming Chiu served as head librarian of the library until his retirement in 1964, after which he was succeeded by Eugene Wu. In 1965, the Chinese-Japanese Library of the Harvard-Yenching Institute was renamed the Harvard-Yenching Library to reflect the expanded nature of the library's collections. The Library eventually added Tibetan, Mongolian and Manchu publications, as well as Western language monographs and journals.

He married Ingrid Blehr (1881‚Äì1959) in July 1901; they divorced in 1910. Through his wife's sister he was a brother-in-law of Gunnar Heiberg. Career He finished his secondary education in 1884, and enrolled in law studies at the University of Kristiania. His 1888 literary debut, the poetry collection Elskov ('Love'), was ill-received. He was found guilty of \\"seduction\\", a breach of the by-laws of the University. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court of Norway, and he was relegated for one year. It was his first and last work of fiction, and he instead concentrated on studies for the rest of the period and graduated with the cand.jur. degree from the University of Kristiania in 1891. In 1896 he was hired as a secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of the Interior. More importantly however, from the same year he worked as a theatre critic for the newspaper Morgenbladet. Then, after a period in Verdens Gang he followed Olaf Thommessen to the new newspaper Tidens Tegn. B√∏dtker worked for Tidens Tegn in two periods, intercepted by a brief tenure in Aftenposten. B√∏dtker did work as a secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture from 1900 to 1903, but then became a full-time theatre critic--Norway's first.
