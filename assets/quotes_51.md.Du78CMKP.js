The cross is dedicated to a certain Thomas, son of a doctor named Patrick. These men may well have been members of the Beaton medical kindred.Islay (n.d.); Late Medieval Cross (n.d.). The Beaton medical kindred, also known as Clann Meic-bethad and Clan MacBeth,Bannerman (1986) p. 1. was a Scottish kindred of professional physicians that practised medicine in the classical Gaelic tradition from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Era. The kindred appears to have emigrated from Ireland in the fourteenth century, where members seem to have originally learned their craft.Munro; Macintyre (2013). According to tradition, the kindred first arrived in Scotland in the retinue of the √Åine N√≠ Chath√°in, daughter of C√∫ Maighe na nGall √ì Cath√°in, a woman who married Aonghus √ìg Mac Domhnaill in about 1300.Thomson (1968) p. 61. In time the kindred came to be prominent in the Scottish Highlands and Islands, although the earliest known member appears on record in the Lowlands, in Dumfries, during the early fourteenth century.Proctor (2007) p. 18, 18 n. 11. The kindred first came to be associated with Islay in the early fifteenth century, and afterwards proceeded to spread to other islands. Eventually, the kindred became the largest and longest serving of the three major mediaeval medical dynasties in Gaelic Scotland. The kindred is commonly confused with the unrelated Bethune or Beaton family, historically centred in Fife.Munro; Macintyre (2013); MacGregor (1999). In fact, the medical kindred adopted the surname Beaton in the fifteenth century. By the seventeenth century, most of the seventeen or so families within the kindred had adopted the surname Beaton, although two used the surname Bethune. Partly as a result members of the medical kindred mistakenly came to think of themselves as descended from the Bethunes of Balfour, the principal branch of the aforesaid Bethune or Beaton family (who were ultimately of Continental origin). Like other learned Gaelic families, members of the kindred copied and compiled manuscripts.Cheape (1993) p. 123 n. 29. According to Martin Martin, just before the turn of the eighteenth century, a member of the kindred possessed a library of manuscripts works of Avicenna, Averroes, Joannes de Vigo, Bernardus Gordonus, and Hippocrates.Thomson (1968) p. 62. The most substantial surviving example of such a work compiled by the kindred is an early sixteenth-century Gaelic translation of Gordonus' Lilium medicinae, the largest Gaelic manuscript in Scotland. There have been as many as seventy-six physicians of the kindred identified between the years 1300 and 1750.Munro; Macintyre (2013); Broun; MacGregor (2009); Cheape (1993) p. 123 n. 22. Members were employed by every Scottish monarch between Robert I, King of Scotland (died 1329) and Charles I, King of Scotland (died 1649),Broun; MacGregor (2009); MacGregor (1999). and patronised by numerous Scottish clans such as the Frasers of Lovat, MacDonald Lords of the Isles, the MacLeans of Duart,Nicholls (1991). the MacLeods of Dunvegan, and the Munros of Foulis.Bannerman (1986) p. 72. By the eighteenth century, the family ceased to produce hereditary physicians. The last died in 1714, described as \\"the only scholar of his race\\".

The helicopters had just departed together from the same spot and collided during the initial climb-out. They were transporting production staff and guests for the French reality TV series Dropped, and among the victims were French sailor Florence Arthaud, swimmer Camille Muffat and boxer Alexis Vastine. Background The French television channel TF1 was filming an episode of Dropped, a reality TV show that takes celebrities to a hostile environment by helicopter and films their efforts to survive. The cast comprised various Olympic medallists and international sportspeople, including French athletes Alain Bernard, Philippe Candeloro, Jeannie Longo, and Sylvain Wiltord, plus Arthaud, Muffat and Vastine; Swiss athlete Anne-Flore Marxer was also taking part. Filming began in late February 2015 in Ushuaia, in the far south of Argentina, before moving to Northwest Argentina, in the province of La Rioja, about from the capital Buenos Aires. At the time of the accident, Wiltord had already been eliminated from the competition and was back in France. Collision Each helicopter was carrying four passengers in addition to the pilot. Seconds after taking off together, at about 17:15 local time (20:15 UTC), the two helicopters collided while climbing away at a height of about , and both crashed to the ground. A video of the accident appears to show the lower of the two helicopters climbing at a higher rate than the other one, colliding with it from below. Weather conditions at the time were reported as good. Aircraft The two aircraft involved were both Eurocopter AS350B3 √âcureuil; one was registered LQ-CGK, the other LQ-FJQ. LQ-CGK was manufactured in 2010 and was owned by the provincial government of La Rioja. LQ-FJQ was manufactured in 2012 and was owned by the provincial government of Santiago del Estero.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle for the churches in Galatia, written between 49‚Äì58 CE. This chapter contains Paul's important argument about Abraham's faith and his 'offspring', a designation for \\"those belong to Jesus Christ\\".  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 29 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 46 (~AD 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Uncial 0176 (4th/5th century; extant verses 16-25) *Papyrus 99 (~400) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 6-8, 16-17, 24-28) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) =Old Testament references= *Galatians 3:6: * : ; ; ; ; *Galatians 3:10: ; Jeremiah 11:3 *Galatians 3:11: Habakkuk 2:4 * : *Galatians 3:13: * : ; ; How to receive the Spirit (3:1‚Äì5) Paul questions whether the Galatians received the Spirit by \\"works of the law\\" or by \\"believing what is heard\\", because receiving the Spirit is \\"the basis of their Christian experience\\" and should be continued in Spirit, not \\"with the flesh\\", meaning not on \\"the basis of carrying out the requirements of the law\\". Abraham Believed God (3:6‚Äì14) Abraham is introduced in this part as his story is well-known to the people. The focus is on \\"Abraham's faith in God as the basis of his standing before God\\". =Verse 6= :just as Abraham \\"believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.\\" NKJV Paul cited from the Old Testament, . =Verse 10= :For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, \\"Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.\\" NKJV Citation from ; Jeremiah 11:3 =Verse 11= : But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for ‚Äúthe just shall live by faith.‚Äù NKJV Citation from: Habakkuk 2:4 * \\"But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident\\" The Pulpit Commentary paraphrases as \\"but that in the Law no man is justified with God, is evident,\\" that \\"be justified\\" means to be brought out of a state of guiltiness and cursedness into a state of acceptance. This commentary asserts that Paul, assuming every one guilty and under a curse, now shows that the Law offers no means of justification, and thus by \\"adducing that cardinal aphorism of Habakkuk\\" substantiates the doctrine of justification by faith (also cited in Romans 1:17; Hebrews 10:38). When in it is read that in the synagogue at the Pisidian Antioch, in close connection with the statement that through believing in Christ a man is justified, Paul cited another passage of Habakkuk (), denouncing unbelieving despisers, indicating to the Pulpit Commentary that he had made good his statement about justification by alleging this same probative text. * \\"By the law\\" or \\"in the law\\" (Greek: ·ºêŒΩ ŒΩœåŒº·ø≥, en nom≈ç) The \\"law\\" is defined in the Pulpit Commentary as \\"being it\\", \\"the sphere and domain of the Law\\", comparing the use of the same preposition with Romans 2:12 (\\"As many as have sinned under [Greek, 'in'] the Law;\\") Romans 3:19 (\\"It saith to them that are under [Greek, 'in'] the Law.\\"), whereas an exactly parallel construction is found in Acts 13:39 (\\"From all things from which ye could not by [Greek, 'in'] the Law be justified.\\"). * \\"Is justified with God\\" (Greek: Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒø·ø¶œÑŒ±Œπ œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÑ·ø∑ Œ∏Œµ·ø∑, dikaioutai para t≈ç The≈ç\\") Noted in the Pulpit Commentary that the preposition \\"with\\" (œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨, para) is used similarly in Romans 2:13 (\\"For not the hearers of the Law are righteous with God\\"); 1 Corinthians 3:19 (\\"The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God\\"), so it is God himself that justifies the sinner (Romans 3:30; Romans 4:5). * \\"The just shall live by faith\\" (Greek: ·ΩÅ Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ ·ºêŒ∫ œÄŒØœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ Œ∂ŒÆœÉŒµœÑŒ±Œπ, ho dikaios ek piste≈çs zƒìsetai): A paraphrase based on direct translation from Greek in the Pulpit Commentary: \\"the righteous by faith shall live\\". It is noted in the Pulpit Commentary that the text doesn't use the usual phrase \\"as Scripture saith\\", like in the next verse out of Leviticus; which is also the case in Romans 9:7, but in Romans 15:3 and 1 Corinthians 2:9 Paul inserts, \\"according as it is written,\\" in parenthesis, before proceeding with the words of Scripture in such a way as to form a continuation of his own sentence. The same commentary claims to be generally agreed upon by Hebrew scholars that in the original passage (Habakkuk 2:4) the words, \\"by his faith\\" (or possibly, adopting another reading of the Hebrew text, \\"by my faith,\\" that is, by faith in me) belong to \\"shall live,\\" rather than to \\"the righteous\\" (see on this point Delitzsch on Hebrews 10:38, and Canon Cook on Habakkuk 2:4, in 'Speaker's Commentary'). The \\"faith\\" spoken of is shown by the context in Habakkuk to mean such reliance upon God as is of a steadfast character, and not a mere fleeting or occasional acceptance of God's promises as true, as the Pulpit Commentary points that this is plainly the view of the passage which is taken by the Pauline writer of the Hebrews in Hebrews 10:38.Pulpit Commentary, edited by H.D.M. Spence and Joseph S. Exell, 1890. =Verse 13= : Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, ‚ÄúCursed is everyone who hangs on a tree‚Äù), NKJV *\\"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law\\": Following Gill, the \\"Redeemer\\" is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was called and appointed to do this work by his Father, with full agreement fulfilling the prophecy under this character, qualified as man, as a \\"near kinsman\\", who has the right to redeem a person, and at the same time, as God, to accomplish it. Christ redeems \\"us\\", who are God's elect (\\"both Jews and Gentiles\\"). Gill wrote that Christ owns 'us' by the Father's gift, and now he purchases 'us' with the price of his own blood, delivering 'us' \\"from the curse of the law\\" and \\"from wrath to come\\", which is the second death.\\" *\\"Made a curse for us\\": Gill put this in the sense that Christ was made \\"an accursed person\\", despised by people of his generation, calling him a sinner, even called a \\"Samaritan\\", and \\"devil\\"; \\"even accursed by the law\\", while he was placed under the law, stood in the people's legal place and take the burden of their sins according to the law, which charges him with the sins, and curses him for their sake; and lastly also was accursed by the justice of God, his Father, who doesn't spare him, placing justice against him, punishing him up to death, that is the accursed death of the cross. It seems then that \\"he was made a curse\\", where \\"made\\" here is \\"by the will, counsel, and determination of God\\", and also his own will and free consent, as Jesus \\"freely laid down his life, and gave himself, and made his soul an offering for sin\\".John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, - Galatians 3:13 *\\"Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree\\": Citation from Abraham's Offspring (3:15‚Äì29) In this part, Paul states that the interpretation of the promises in is not for Abraham's \\"descendants\\" (plural), but for his \\"offspring\\" (singular; \\"seed\\" in Greek), referring to one person, Christ.. The true \\"children of Abraham\\" are thus \\"those who are in Christ Jesus\\". =Verse 16= : Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, ‚ÄúAnd to seeds,‚Äù as of many, but as of one, ‚ÄúAnd to your Seed,‚Äù who is Christ. NKJV Paul cited from the Old Testament, ; ; .

Biography  Born in 1902, P√§rsim√§gi was the son of a wealthy \\"gentleman farmer\\". In 1919, he participated in the Estonian War of Independence and was awarded a medal. After that, against his father's wishes, he went to Tartu to enrol at the new Pallas Art School, known for promoting modern art. In addition to the newer styles, such as Fauvism, he found himself influenced by Estonian folk art and by Konrad M√§gi, who was a teacher there. He also studied with Ado Vabbe and Nikolai Triik and went on a study trip to Germany in 1923. That same year, he held his first exhibition. He interrupted his training several times to visit the family farm and paint landscapes. He moved to Paris in 1937 with the financial support of his father, who had finally become reconciled to his son's career choice. While there, he studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and came under the influence of Paul C√©zanne, although he became known as the \\"Estonian Matisse\\". At the outbreak of World War II, unlike most other Baltic artists, he refused to return to his homeland, which was now occupied by the Russians. In 1941, he was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Auschwitz via Drancy internment camp. The reasons for his arrest remain unclear. He was not Jewish, but may have been trying to help a Jewish friend or active in the French Resistance. Sexual orientation has also been cited as a possible motive.\\"M√ºstiline Karl P√§rsim√§gi\\" by K√§di Talvoja from the Sirp website. He was put to death the following year. Because of his support for Estonian independence, his works were denied official recognition by the Soviet Union, but interest was renewed after 1991.

Life  Louis-Armand-Constantin was the fifth of seven children of Hercule M√©riadec, Duc de Montbazon and Louise Gabrielle Julie de Rohan- Soubise, daughter of Hercule M√©riadec, Prince de Rohan, head of the cadet branch of the House of Rohan. Louis-Armand-Constantin was a member of the senior branch of the House of Rohan, a powerful French family which claimed descent from the sovereign Dukes of Britanny, in right of which it held the rank of prince √©tranger at the French court. Rohan joined the French Navy and was the captain of Raisonnable at the Action of 29 April 1758, at which his ship was captured in the Bay of Biscay by HMS Dorsetshire during the Seven Years' War. In 1764, after the war, he was promoted to Chef d'escadre and in 1766 was appointed governor of Leeward Islands. In 1768 he was engaged in quelling a revolt by the French colonists in Saint-Domingue. In 1770 de Rohan was promoted to Navy Lieutenant General and the following year married Louise Rosalie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, daughter of Fran√ßois Victor Le Tonnelier de Breteuil. He was an active Freemason. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Rohan was promoted to vice-admiral in the Levant Fleet, based at Toulon, but his actions at Saint-Domingue in 1768 and 1769 had attracted controversy and he was repeatedly refused colonial and command postings. Following the French Revolution of 1789, towards which he was openly hostile, he left the Navy, and in 1794, after refusing to prove his allegiance to the French Republic he was condemned by a Revolutionary Tribunal and executed in Paris by guillotine on 27 July.

God sent Jesus as his heir to \\"redeem those under the law\\", so \\"all who are in Christ Jesus might receive adoption.\\" =Verse 4= :But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, NKJV *\\"The fullness of the time\\": Paul believed and affirmed that the sending of Jesus Christ is at \\"the nodal point of salvation-history\\". *\\"Born under the law\\" means \\"born as a Jew.\\" =Verse 5= :to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. NKJV *\\"To redeem those who were under the law\\": means \\"to redeem from the 'curse of the law\\"' (Galatians 3:13), which is achieved by Christ's death \\"on which a curse was pronounced\\". =Verse 6= : And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, \\"Abba, Father!\\" NKJV *\\"And because you are sons\\": Some copies have \\"...sons of God\\"; the Ethiopian version reads \\"inasmuch as ye are his sons\\". God set up Christ, his Son, as the pattern for these sons to conform, by virtue of his act of grace they were considered as the children of God through Christ when he \\"partook of their flesh and blood\\", and died to gather them together who were scattered (cf. ; ). The sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty become the siblings of the Son of God, because through the redemption of Christ they receive the adoption as children, not as servants. *\\"God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, \\"Abba, Father!\\"\\": The Syriac and Arabic versions read, \\"our Father\\". All the three divine persons: God and his Son and the Spirit of his Son appear here. The same Spirit of God that moved upon the face of the waters at the creation of the world, has moved holy men of God to write the Scriptures, formed and filled the human nature of Christ, and descended on him as a dove (see Baptism of Jesus), and by whom Christ and his apostles performed their miracles; it is called in JudaismBereshit Rabba, fol. 2. 4. & 6\\\\. 3.

(4:8‚Äì11) This part exposes Paul's fear that the Galatians, who before becoming Christians were enslaved to idols, now after being believers of Christ would want to be enslaved again, by meticulously observing the Jewish calendar rituals. Paul's Perplexity (4:12‚Äì20) The verses 12‚Äì20 display Paul's \\"passionate concern\\" for the spiritual condition of the Galatians, whom he addressed as 'friends' or 'brethren' (verse 12) and 'my little children' (verse 19), and his wish to be personally present in their midst. The Hagar and Sarah Allegory (4:21‚Äì5:1) This part is considered as \\"Paul's striking final argument\\" to contrast the children born of 'a slave woman' (Hagar), that is \\"to be subject to the law\\", with the children born of 'a free woman' (Sarah) 'through the promise' and 'according to the Spirit'; a contrast between \\"law\\" and \\"grace\\".Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary, 2011, p. 561 =Verse 25= : for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children‚Äî NKJV *\\"Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia\\": NRSV gives the second rendering in its note, \\"For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia\\". =Verse 27= : For it is written: ::\\"Rejoice, O barren, ::You who do not bear! ::Break forth and shout, ::You who are not in labor! ::For the desolate has many more children ::Than she who has a husband.\\" NKJV Citation from Isaiah 54:1 See also * Abraham * Arabia * Hagar * Isaac * Jerusalem * Jesus Christ * Mount Sinai * Sarah * Other related Bible parts: Genesis 15, Genesis 16, Genesis 17, Genesis 21, Genesis 25, Deuteronomy 34, Deuteronomy 27, Isaiah 54, Matthew 6, Luke 11, John 1.

He is credited with originating the ' (\\"creative prints\\") movement, which aimed at self- expressive printmaking, in contrast to the commercial studio systems of ukiyo-e and '. He initiated movements in folk arts and children's art education that continue to be influential in Japan. Kanae trained as a wood engraver in the Western style before studying Western-style painting. While at art school he executed a two-colour print of a fisherman he had sketched on a trip to Chiba. Its publication ignited an interest in the expressive potential of prints that developed into the ' movement. Kanae spent 1912 to 1916 in Europe and brought ideas back to Japan gleaned from exhibitions of peasant crafts and children's art in Russia. In the late 1910s he founded movements the promotion of creative peasant crafts and in children's art education; the latter quickly gained adherents but was suppressed under Japan's growing militarism. These ideas experienced a revival after World War II. Though always a supporter, Kanae left behind printmaking in the 1920s and devoted his artistic output to painting until he suffered a stroke in 1942. He spent his remaining years in mountainous Nagano in the city of Ueda, where the Kanae Yamamoto Memorial Museum was erected in 1962. Life and careerEarly life and training (1882‚Äì1907)= Kanae Yamamoto descended from the of hatamoto‚Äîsamurai in the direct service of the Tokugawa shogunate of feudal Japan in Edo (modern Tokyo). His grandfather died 1868 in the Battle of Ueno, during the Boshin War which led to the fall of the Shogunate and the Meiji Restoration which returned power to the Emperor. This orphaned Kanae's father Ichir≈ç, and thereafter he grew up in Okazaki in Aichi Prefecture; how he got there is a matter of speculation. The specialist in Chinese medicine, Ry≈çsai Yamamoto, from line of specialists in traditional Chinese medicine, took in Ichir≈ç with the intention of raising him to marry his daughter Take, the eldest of the family's nine children. Kanae was born 24 October 1882 in the 1-ch≈çme neighbourhood of Okazaki. Ry≈çsai intended Ichir≈ç to continue the family profession, but when the Meiji government announced it would grant medical licenses only to those who practised Western medicine, Ichir≈ç moved to Tokyo to study it shortly after Kanae's birth. He lodged in the household of Mori ≈ågai's father, where he performed household duties to earn his keep. To advance his studies he took part the clandestine digging up of fresh graves to find bodies for dissection. When he was five, Kanae and his mother joined Ichir≈ç in Tokyo and settled in a tenement house in the San'ya area. His mother did sewing work to help support the family, and with her sister Tama provided maid service to the Mori household, and thus Kanae often met his younger cousin, Murayama Kaita, who, like Kanae, was to make a career in art. The painter Harada Naojir≈ç, whom ≈ågai had befriended when the two were studying in Germany, asked Kanae's mother, whom he had seen at the Mori household, to model for the painting Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon of 1890. Such occurrences may have contributed to attracting Kanae to art. Kanae's mother modelled for Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon. Harada Naojir≈ç, oil on canvas, 1890 Ichir≈ç raised his son under the influence of the liberal educational principles of Nakae Ch≈çmin. Ichir≈ç was responsible for the welfare of five of his wife's siblings, and so at age 11, after four years of primary school, the family finances did not permit Kanae's schooling to continue. He became an apprentice wood engraver and mastered Western techniques of tonal gradation in the workshop of Sakurai Torakichi in Shiba. His training focused on book and newspaper illustration, and included letterpress printing and photoengraving. His skill developed quickly and soon won praise from those he worked with. During this time printing technology underwent rapid change, brought to the forefront by the First Sino-Japanese War, which was reported in a variety of media, from paintings and woodblock prints to photographs. Kanae completed his apprenticeship at 18, followed by an obligatory year of service with Sakurai. By 1896, Ichir≈ç had earned his medical license and set up a practice in (now part of Ueda), a village in Nagano Prefecture. The rapid change in printing technology led Kanae to doubt his future prospects in wood engraving. He aspired to become a painter but knew his yet-indebted father was not in a position to pay for art school. He secretly enrolled at the in 1902, where he studied y≈çga Western-style painting. His instructors there included , , and Kuroda Seiki. To pay for school, Kanae worked odd printing jobs for employers such as the Hochi Shimbun newspaper, and from February 1903 lodged at the home of his friend Ishii Hakutei, the eldest son of the artist . Kanae and the other aspiring artists lodged there talked into the night about art and hired a model for life drawing once a month. =Prints and s≈çsaku hanga (1904‚Äì1911)= Kanae joined a group of friends in July 1904 on a trip to Ch≈çshi in Chiba Prefecture, where they stayed near the mouth of the Tone River. There he made a sketch of a fisherman dressed in ceremonial clothing overlooking a harbour. When he returned, he used the sketch as the basis of a wood engraving. He engraved on both sides of a single piece of wood: the one side he printed in ochre, which filled in all the spaces except the towel on the fisherman's head; the other he printed in black, which provided outlines and details. At the time, the art establishment saw woodblock printing as a commercial venture beneath the station of an aspiring fine artist. Hakutei noticed the print and had it published in the July issue of the literary magazine My≈çj≈ç. In a column in the issue Ishii promoted the print as revolutionary, as it had been done as a means of painterly spontaneous self-expression, and used methods Ishii associated with ukiyo-e traditions. Soon the style Ishii dubbed ' became a popular topic within My≈çj≈ç circles. This was to grow into the ' (\\"creative prints\\") movement. Yamamoto 1904.jpgalt=Two-colour print of the rear view of manFisherman, woodblock print, 1904 Kanae Yamamoto (1905) Kach≈ç.jpgalt=Painting of a woman seated behind a netMosquito Net, oil painting, 1905 H≈çsun Volume 4 Issue 4 cover.jpgalt=Magazine cover with writing in Japanese and an inset colour print of a headH≈çsun Vol. 4 No. 4, 1910, inset colour print by Kanae In summer 1905 Kanae visited his parents in Nagano, where he produced the oil painting Mosquito Net, the earliest of his oil paintings to be made public. That September Kanae, Hakutei and Ishii Tsuzur≈ç, and some other friends founded the short-lived magazine Heitan in which they published a number of their prints. It was in Heitan that the word ' first appeared. The word was used interchangeably with ' until the magazine came to an end in April 1906; thereafter ' fell out of use and ' went on to become the modern Japanese word for prints in general. Puvis de Chavannes his favourite artist. The Poor Fisherman, 1881 Kanae learned in 1906 of the financial strain his parents still faced with their continuing responsibility for his mother's siblings. He moved out of the Ishiis' home on 8 March 1906 and rented a residence in Morikawa-ch≈ç in of Tokyo determined to pursue financial independence. He graduated on 2 April 1906 from the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, and in his graduation yearbook declared the French painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes his favourite artist. He took work at Rakuten Kitazawa's Tokyo Puck, a cartoon humour magazine patterned after the American Puck. Kanae felt disappointed at hand-printing's gradual loss of prestige in Japan; to revive interest he wrote a four-part series of articles in 1907 for the art magazine Mizu-e examining a wide variety of printing media and techniques. Kanae, Hakutei, and a former art-school classmate of Kanae's, Morita Tsunetomo, founded the monthly magazine H≈çsun. whose first issue appeared 15 May 1907. It was patterned on such European magazines as Cocorico, Jugend, Simplicissimus. The contents were primarily literature, criticism, and art cartoons, and its publishers paid fine attention to details of graphic design. They printed the magazine on fine paper at an unusually large size and mixed colour reproduction with black-and-white. Kanae's contributions included his own prints, haiku poetry, and the carving of printing blocks for the designs of others. Kanae's former engraving teacher Sakurai Torakichi furnished the photographic printing plates. The first issue was eight pages and included a supplementary print of Shiba Park by Kanae. The young artists distributed the issue themselves to bookstores. It sold well, and the circle of contributors grew, as did the page count, which expanded to sixteen. Tokyo during the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912) had a great openness to foreign‚Äîespecially European‚Äîinfluence, and Western trends in art were quickly replacing traditional Japanese ones until word spread of the impact exported ukiyo-e had had on art in the West. Artists who had all but abandoned the culture of the Edo period began to reconsider it and mix elements of it with Western approaches. Kanae took part in meetings of the Pan no Kai group of writers and artists whose goal was to replicate the atmosphere of Parisian caf√©s such as Caf√© Guerbois of the Impressionists. At one of these rowdy bohemian meetings, a drunken Kanae fell through a window and landed in the garden below, wrapped in a ' paper screen; he returned to the gathering as if nothing had happened. The police kept watch over these meetings whose members they suspected of having socialist sympathies and held grudges over caricatures some of the members had published. Pan no Kai waned and came to and end in 1911. Kabuki actor Sawamura Ch≈çj≈´r≈ç as Taira no Atsumori, from the series S≈çga butai sugata (\\"Stage Figure Sketches\\"), woodblock print, 1911 Kanae wanted to revive the spirit of Edo-period ukiyo-e in his prints, and to this end in 1911 he founded the Tokyo Print Club to produce and distribute such prints. He advertised for members in H≈çsun, but after the magazine's demise most of the associated artists left Tokyo and the only member he could recruit was Hanjir≈ç Sakamoto. The pair began a series titled S≈çga-butai sugata (\\"Stage Figure Sketches\\") of portraits of kabuki actors in the vein of the ' genre of ukiyo-e. The subjects were sketched from performances at the just-built Imperial Theatre and were captioned in French on the front and on the back in Japanese. Though Kanae had announced that prints were to come from thirty-four theatre pieces only three sets of four prints‚Äîtwo by each artist in each set‚Äîappeared in June, July, and September that year. The work represents a major turning point in his career as he turned away from the Western techniques that had defined his work toward a more Japanese approach such as the use of flat areas of colour. The prints failed to sell at first but began to find buyers only after he had left for France the following year. As Kanae was away the printer was not able to issue a second printing to meet the demand. Kanae had come to neglect H≈çsun as he devoted himself to S≈çga-butai sugata. Hakutei and Tsunetomo had left Tokyo, and that July the magazine came to an end after thirty-five issues. =Europe (1912‚Äì1916)= Kanae had wanted to marry Mitsu Ishii, but her family forbade it‚Äîespecially her mother and brother Hakutei. This rejection embittered him and he broke his friendship with Hakutei, though he remained friends with Tsuruz≈ç. Kanae wished to study painting in Paris, so his father organized the distribution and sale of his son's work to raise funds for it while he was away. He set off on the Tango Maru from Kobe on 6 July 1912, and fifty-three days later landed in Marseilles. While on board he made what was likely the first of the prints he father was to sell for him by subscription: titled Wild Chickens, it depicted three Chinese prostitutes with bound feet inspired by prostitutes he saw when he passed through Shanghai. He printed it in Paris, where in his first few months he studied etching at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. On the Deck, colour woodblock print, 1913, from a sketch made in Singapore in 1912 Upon arrival Kanae contacted the painter Sanzo Wada, who had been in Paris since 1907. Wada introduced him to Kunishir≈ç Mitsutani, and Kanae soon moved into a studio next to Mitsutani's. He found French difficult to master and associated mostly with expatriate Japanese artists such as Ry≈´zabur≈ç Umehara and S≈çtar≈ç Yasui. His closest friend there was Misei Kosugi, a contributor to H≈çsun who arrived in March 1913 to spend a year travelling Europe. In 1913 the writer T≈çson Shimazaki visited Kanae, whom he had known from Ueda. The two shared the recent experience of having been denied a marriage. T≈çson wrote of the print On the Deck that Kanae was finding difficult to finish: a print of a long-haired woman on the deck of the Tango Maru as it was in Singapore. It was made with six cherry woodblocks on mulberry washi paper, materials Kanae had brought from Japan. The print was sent to Japan that May. The pair went to seaside Brittany for six weeks from that July, and soon were joined by a number of other artists, all of whom were drawn there by the tales of the beauty of the region Kuroda Seiki had written in the 19th century. Kanae was particularly productive of prints while in Brittany. Kanae felt isolated from the culture and found little art there that he appreciated. He disliked the paintings of van Gogh, Monet, and √âdouard Manet. He liked the works of Renoir and Sisley, and Puvis de Chavannes, admired the paintings of C√©zanne, but denied any connection between them and those of the Cubists whose works he denigrated; he wrote that only one in three thousand paintings of Matisse were good. Cow, colour woodblock print, 1913, produced in Brittany Kanae imagined himself a realist and was distressed at the avant-garde that was coming to dominate the European art world; he found it difficult to comprehend and reconcile it with his understanding of a realist ideal in Western art. His disappointment and confusion impacted his productivity; he produced few of the prints that were supposed to fund his stay, and the language barrier made it difficult to find buyers. A Tokyo agent of his committed suicide after appropriating money from Kanae and other clients. He could not bring himself to reveal his and his parents' financial situation, so he had another agent, Rokur≈ç Watanabe, send money to Paris just so he could send it back to his parents, who were under pressure from a loan shark. Along with his disappointment in the Western art world, Kanae witnessed first-hand the impact Japanese art had had there. Though he kept such thoughts to himself he began to feel a sense of the superiority of Japanese art‚Äîof the same traditions he had denied himself during his years of training. Kanae managed to acquire funds from connections and refused to return early to Japan despite the urgings of friends and associates. Troubles thickened in mid-1914 when World War I broke out and he learned that Mitsu Ishii had married. The war drove him from Paris to London where he stayed for four months, much of it sick with bronchitis. He returned to Paris on 11 January 1915, but work was scarce and the museums were closed. He resolved to return to Japan the following spring, but first moved with a group of Japanese compatriots to Lyon where he found work that brought in enough money for a trip to Italy in March 1916 to see the Renaissance masterpieces. Upon returning to Lyon he learned of the death of Sakurai and finally prepared to go back to Japan. Tolstoy's home Yasnaya Polyana (pictured) inspired him to bring democratic education to Japan. The least expensive route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia. He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England, Norway, and Sweden. In Moscow he met the Japanese consul and the social critic Noburu Katagami; the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy's home which he had made into a farmers' school. The experienced moved Kanae, who later was to write, \\"While I was staying in Moscow in the summer of 1916, I felt that I had two important missions. One was promotion of children's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers' art.\\" Kanae visited the Moscow Kustar' Museum, which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885. He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design, and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival. An exhibition of children's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness. Towards the end of 1916 Kanae made the long rail trip across Siberia. Along the way he received a telegram from the poet Hakush≈´ Kitahara. The two had been negotiating the hand of Kitahara's sister Ieko and had finally reached an agreement. =Return to Japan and later career (1916‚Äì1935)= Kanae returned to Japan in December 1916 and took over Sakurai's struggling printing company, which he renamed Seiwad≈ç. In autumn 1917 he had seventeen ' oil paintings displayed at the Nihon Bijutsuin's Inten exhibition. The same year he married Ieko Kitahara, had an instruction book on oil painting published, and finished a number of prints whose subscriptions had been paid for. Kanae aimed at putting together a creative prints association. In June 1918 Kanae co-founded the Nihon S≈çsaku- Hanga Ky≈çkai (\\"Japan Creative Print Cooperative Society\\") with lithographer Kazuma Oda, etcher Takeo Terasaki, and woodblock artist Kogan Tobari; this last had been a member of the Pan no Kai and had also recently returned from several years in Europe. The group held its first exhibition at the art gallery in the Mitsukoshi building in Nihonbashi on 15‚Äì20 January 1919. It represented 277 works by 26 artists, including seventeen woodblock prints and two etchings by Kanae. The show drew twenty thousand visitors and was widely reported in the media, including a special s≈çsaku-hanga issue that March of the prominent art magazine Mizu-e which included an article in which Kanae outlined the principles of the artform and the goals of the Nihon S≈çsaku-Hanga Ky≈çkai. That May the show was repeated at the Mitsukoshi location in Osaka. In 1919 Kanae founded the Japan Children's Free Drawing Association and held its first exhibition. The public was impressed by its democratic ideals, as the idea of democratic education was gaining momentum in Japan during the Taish≈ç period (1912‚Äì26). Kanae propounded the importance of teaching students freedom, without which they cannot grow, and denigrated the tradition of teaching drawing through copying. He promoted this ideas in 1921 with the book Free Drawing Education and the monthly magazine Education of Arts and Freedom. Kanae's methods were widely adopted, and it became common for teachers to take students outdoors to draw from nature. These ideas did not escape criticism, and the rise of militarism in Japan put an end to Kanae's movement in 1928; it was not to be revived until after World War II. Kanae guiding a group of children sketching as part of the Children's Free Drawing movement in Ueda, Nagano Later in 1919 Kanae moved to Ueda, the mountainous Nagano village where his parents lived. He secured funding from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, and Mitsubishi to set up a school that December to teach to the rural population arts and crafts skills they could use to augment their incomes during the long winter months as part of a peasant art movement that combined creativity and utility, inspired by the peasant crafts he had seen in Russia. In 1921, brothers-in-law Rinz≈ç Satake and Sh≈çk≈ç Sasaki consulted with Kanae to develop a pastel crayon with an oil binder; development took three years and resulted in the world's first oil pastel, marketed under the name Cray-Pas through the Sakura Color Products Corporation. The peasant art movement had success in intellectual and government circles. A show at Mitsukoshi of works by sixteen youths was well received. In 1923 Kanae established the Japan Peasant Art Institute which expanded throughout the country with the help of increased government funding in 1925. Critics of the movement saw it as an anachronism or of stripping rural handicrafts of their original charm through commercialism; Kanae saw movement as motivated by a desire to keep creative vitality alive, and not by a sense of nostalgia or desire to preserve older ways. The police suspected Kanae of socialist sympathies as he had brought the idea from Russia. The police so harassed him that he asked Un'ichi Hiratsuka, who was teaching frame-making there, to give up wearing his Russian-style jacket and to cut his long hair. Kanae's initial enthusiasm dwindled over the next five years‚Äîfunding shrank, finding other patrons was wearying, the village mayor went bankrupt, and his attempts to find ways for the farmers to make money off their artwork found little success. After five years the venture went bankrupt. Kanae turned his focus from printmaking to painting. He was a founding member in 1922 of the Shuny≈çkai association for painters who wished to maintain connections with Japanese traditions in the face of the Westernization of academic painting in Japan. He was editor of the association's members' magazine Atorie. He continued to promote the work of print artists and the legitimacy of prints as art. In 1928 the magazine devoted an issue to s≈çsaku hanga, and from the same year Shuny≈çkai included a prize in the print category in its annual exhibitions. In 1924 Kanae travelled to Taiwan for a month to observe local folk craft and advise the government on how to develop the industry. The utilitarian craftwork of the aboriginal Taiwanese people impressed him beyond his expectations. Taiwanese authorities thought to promote the production of bamboo and rattan craftwork, but Kanae thought they could not compete with similar products from Japan and promoted instead the production of products both traditional and new with a distinctive local flavour using traditional designs for sale as souvenirs and exports. After the 1919 show, Kanae passed the leadership of the Nihon S≈çsaku-Hanga Ky≈çkai to K≈çshir≈ç Onchi. In 1931 it became the more comprehensive Nihon Hanga Ky≈çkai (\\"Japan Print Cooperative Society\\"). The same year the Seiwad≈ç printing company went out of business. =Return to painting and final years (1935‚Äì1946)= alt=At Early Autumn at Lake Haruna, oil painting, 1937 In 1935 Kanae settled in Tokyo and returned to painting full-time. He produced a number of oils and watercolours that were exhibited in January 1940 at the Mitsukoshi gallery. The show was well received and attended, and in a dinner that followed Kanae proclaimed, \\"I shall live until May of my eighty-fifth year. Therefore, I am going to sit back now, and drink sake, and paint to my heart's content.\\" While at by Lake Haruna in Gunma Prefecture in 1942 Kanae suffered a cerebral hemorrhage which partially paralyzed him and hindered his ability to paint. He continued to paint as much as he could for the rest of his life, hindered by war shortages, and turned to watercolour when oil painting was too demanding under his disability. In spring 1943 he moved to Ueda in Nagano where he spent his remaining years. He died on 8 October 1946 undergoing surgery for a volvulus at the Nisshind≈ç hospital in Ueda. Style In his prints, Kanae's primary tool was a curved-blade chisel; in ukiyo-e this tool was normally for clean up and a straight chisel for the main carving. His carving followed the Western approach of carving out planes and lines to appear in white, whereas the traditional Japanese technique was to carve around the lines to be printed.

In them K≈çshir≈ç Onchi saw the potential of the woodcut medium, though his style owes more to European artists. Un'ichi Hiratsuka came to believe \\"a real artist ... must cut his own blocks and do his own printing\\" as \\"D√ºrer and Bewick worked\\". S≈çsaku-hanga artists followed Kanae's lead in using a curved chisel to carve out planes rather than to define lines as in Japanese tradition. The dating of most of Kanae's work is uncertain. It is believed that the works he signed in Roman characters were made after he returned to Japan from Europe. The number of copies of Kanae's prints is unknown; it is supposed the subscription prints he made in Europe numbered around 25 to 50. Kanae made few printings of the Fisherman print‚Äîperhaps only one or two‚Äîand none have survived. The Ishiis discovered the block in their house decades later, and Oliver Statler had Hashimoto Okiie made forty copies of a commemorative edition in 1960. Modern Japanese thought on art education begins with Kanae's Free Drawing Education approach. His stature in the history of child art and art education is similar to that of Franz Ci≈æek's in the West. Elementary schools teachers took to his ideas quickly in the wake of their dissatisfaction with the textbooks the government had mandated in 1910 that emphasized copying and neglected personal expression. Yamamoto's was the first public criticism of the textbooks, and his methods led to a sharp decline in their use in the 1920s. Yamamoto encouraged teachers to take children outdoors to sketch, a practice that continues to be common in Japanese elementary schools. Though Japanese militarism put his ideas on hold from the late 1920s educators revived and expanded them beginning in the 1950s. The municipal Kanae Yamamoto Memorial Museum in Ueda in Nagano Prefecture dates from 1962. It houses 1,800 items, including artwork and documents by Kanae and early examples of peasant crafts and children's artwork done under his instruction.

The company is recognized as the biggest independent IBM i software vendor in the world. The company is owned by private equity firms TA Associates, Charlesbank Capital Partners, and HGGC. History1982-2010= HelpSystems, originally known as Help/38, was founded in 1982 by Dick Jacobson. An engineer with Advanced Circuits (AC) in Minnetonka, MN, Jacobson had written a program called Robot/38, used to provide IT automation for the IBM System/38. The program was originally designed to offset the computer costs for AC. In 1988, when IBM replaced the System/38 with the AS/400, the company became known as Help/Systems. The company was spun off in the late 80‚Äôs after AC was sold to Honeywell. In 1991, in response to IBM's introduction of the AS/400 three years earlier, HelpSystems introduced Robot/CONSOLE, Robot/ALERT and Robot/NETWORK, a suite of tools for message management and escalation for the AS/400. In 1992, HelpSystems became the first software company in the United States to be certified under the ISO 9001 standard. In 2005, HelpSystems was bought by Boston-based investment firm Summit Partners. In October 2006, HelpSystems acquired Advanced Systems Concepts (ASC), the developer of SEQUEL reporting and business intelligence tools for the i5/OS and OS/400 platform. HelpSystems created the SEQUEL Software division to support the product. In August 2007, the company announced the Robot/SECURITY suite of products, supporting IBM's i5/OS systems. In September 2007, HelpSystems was acquired by the Boston-based private equity firm Audax Group. In January 2008, HelpSystems expanded their International presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, by purchasing one of their partners and product distributors, eveLogic Group of England. In August 2008, HelpSystems bought OS/400 and IBM i security and compliance software vendor PowerTech, to complement Robot/SECURITY, and the products were eventually combined under the PowerTech name. In October 2008, they followed up by purchasing Bytware, a provider of the StandGuard brand of security, management and anti-virus tools for IBM devices. In 2010, Robot/SCHEDULE Enterprise evolved and led to the launch of Skybot Scheduler, which was turned into a separate division. In May 2011, Skybot Software expanded their customer base by acquiring Fleet, UK-based Open Systems Management, a creator of job scheduling and IT process automation tools for Windows, Unix, and Linux platforms. =2011 - present= In June 2011, HelpSystems bought the DataThread DB2/400 monitoring product from Innovatum, and it became part of the PowerTech line. In April 2012, Summit Partners bought back a majority stake in HelpSystems. In June 2012, HelpSystems purchased UK-based Safestone, a security and compliance software developer for the IBM i. In October 2012, HelpSystems bought Gillingham, UK-based CCSS, the developer of QSystem Monitor, QMessage Monitor and QRemote Control systems monitoring and performance management tools for the IBM i server. In January 2013, HelpSystems announced the acquisition of New Hampshire-based Dartware and their network management product, InterMapper, one of the first network mapping tools ever created. In April 2013, HelpSystems acquired IBM's ShowCase business intelligence products, and added the software to its SEQUEL Software division. In April 2014, the company acquired Los Angeles-based Network Automation, the developer of the AutoMate line of workflow mapping and automation software. At the same time the company announced its Robot/NETWORK Web user interface, which allowed users to see IBM i server performance information from a mobile phone or any device with a Web browser. In July 2014, HelpSystems acquired Minneapolis-based document management software company RJS Software, and the data warehousing product from Australia-based Coglin Mill. Coglin Mill's data warehouse product RODIN was added to the SEQUEL product line. After this acquisition, the company was acknowledged by New York-based IT publisher IT Jungle as the biggest independent IBM i vendor in the world. In January 2015, HelpSystems bought Peterborough, England-based Halcyon, a developer of software for multi-platform systems management, and announced its intention to operate Halcyon as an independent company for the time being. In June, HelpSystems bought IBM i security vendor SkyView Partners, a deal which included SkyView's team of security experts. In 2017 this team expanded its service to help customers with AIX and Linux platforms too. In August, it was announced that the company was being acquired by Florida-based private equity firm H.I.G. Capital, for an undisclosed amount. In February 2016, HelpSystems acquired Tango/04 Computing Group, a software company specialized on monitoring, with HQ in Barcelona (Spain) and offices in Buenos Aires (Argentina).

Although it is not known when or where the first dome was created, sporadic examples of early domed structures have been discovered. Brick domes from the ancient Near East and corbelled stone domes have been found from the Middle East to Western Europe. These may indicate a common source or multiple independent traditions. A variety of materials have been used, including wood, mudbrick, or fabric. Indigenous peoples around the world produce similar structures today.  Early and indigenous domes  Photo of an Apache wigwam, by Edward S. Curtis, 1903. The earliest domes were likely domed huts made from saplings, reeds, or timbers and covered with thatch, turf, or skins. Materials may have transitioned to rammed earth, mud-brick, or more durable stone as a result of local conditions. The earliest discovered remains of domed constructions may be four small dwellings made of Mammoth tusks and bones. The first was found by a farmer in Mezhirich, Ukraine, in 1965 while he was digging in his cellar and archaeologists unearthed three more. They date from 19,280‚Äì11,700 BC. More recently, semi-subterranean dwellings of the Thule people, ancestors of the Inuit who were established in the Canadian Arctic by 1300 AD, were made of whalebone frames lashed together with hide straps in a parabolic dome shape covered with hides and blocks of sod and snow. The igloo, a shelter built from blocks of ice in a spiral, was used by the Inuit people. The wigwam was made by Native Americans and covered with hides or bark. In developing countries, domes are often less expensive alternatives to flat or sloped-roofed construction because they use less material to enclose a given volume and provide a lower rate of heat transfer due to the reduced surface area. Domes made with loam are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, almost always using mud-bricks or adobes. A way of building them without centering called the Persian dome technique has been used for centuries in Afghanistan. Although descended from a longer tradition, the examples of clay brick beehive domes at Harran, Turkey, have been dated to the 19th century AD, as are the dry stone trulli of Italy. The Ef√© people of central Africa construct similar structures, using leaves as shingles. The Himba people of Namibia construct \\"desert igloos\\" of wattle and daub for use as temporary shelters at seasonal cattle camps, and as permanent homes by the poor. Extraordinarily thin domes of sun-baked clay 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, and nearly parabolic in curve, are known from Cameroon. Turkic and Mongolian nomads have used domed tents covered in felt for at least a thousand years in central Asia, and to the early 1900s they were used from Anatolia to Mongolia. The historical development from structures like these to more sophisticated domes is not well documented. That the dome was known to early Mesopotamia may explain the existence of domes in both China and the West in the first millennium BC. Another explanation, however, is that the use of the dome shape in construction did not have a single point of origin and was common in virtually all cultures long before domes were constructed with enduring materials.  Ancient Near East  Drawing of an Assyrian bas-relief from Nimrud. Small domes in corbelled stone or brick over round-plan houses go back to the Neolithic period in the ancient Near East, and served as dwellings for poorer people throughout the prehistoric period, but domes did not play an important role in monumental architecture. The discoveries of seal impressions in the ancient site of Chogha Mish (c. 6800 to 3000 BC), located in the Susiana plains of Iran, show the extensive use of dome structures in mud-brick and adobe buildings, likely granaries. Other examples of mud-brick buildings that also seemed to employ the \\"true\\" dome technique have been excavated at Tell Arpachiyah, a Mesopotamian site of the Halaf (c. 6100 to 5400 BC) and Ubaid (ca. 5300 to 4000 BC) cultures. Excavations at Tell al-Rimah have revealed pitched-brick domical vaults from about 2000 BC. At the Sumerian Royal Cemetery of Ur, a \\"complete rubble dome built over a timber centring\\" was found among the chambers of the tombs for Meskalamdug and Puabi, dating to around 2500 BC. Set in mud mortar, it was a \\"true dome with pendentives rounding off the angles of the square chamber.\\" Other small domes can be inferred from the remaining ground plans, such as one in the courtyard of Ur- Nammu's ziggurat, and in later shrines and temples of the 14th century BC. Some monumental Mesopotamian buildings of the Kassite period are thought to have had brick domes, but the issue is unsettled due to insufficient evidence in what has survived of these structures. A Neo-Assyrian bas-relief from Kuyunjik depicts domed buildings, although remains of such a structure in that ancient city have yet to be identified, perhaps due to the impermanent nature of sun-dried mudbrick construction. However, because the relief depicts the Assyrian overland transport of a carved stone statue, the background buildings most likely refer to a foreign village, such as those at the foothills of the Lebanese mountains. The relief dates to the 8th century BC, while the use of domical structures in the Syrian region may go back as far as the fourth millennium BC. Likewise, domed houses at Shulaveri in Georgia and Khirokitia, Cyprus, date back to around 6000 BC.  Ancient Middle East and Mediterranean  Drawing of the so-called Treasury of Atreus in Mycenae, Greece. Ancient stone corbelled domes have been found from the Middle East to Western Europe. Corbelled beehive domes were used as granaries in Ancient Egypt from the first dynasty, in mastaba tombs of the Old Kingdom, as pressure-relieving devices in private brick pyramids of the New Kingdom, and as kilns and cellars. They have been found in brick and in stone. The mastaba tombs of Seneb and of Neferi are examples. A model of a 10th dynasty house has also been found in Rifeh showing the tops of three domes just emerging through the terraced roof. In an area straddling the borders between Oman, UAE, and Bahrain, stone beehive tombs built above ground called \\"Hafit graves\\", or \\"Mezyat graves\\", date to the Hafit period between 3200 and 2700 BC. Similar above-ground tombs made of corbelled stone domes have been found in the fourth cataract region of Nubia with dates beginning in the second millennium BC. The \\"Nubian dome\\" technique of using a movable guide to lay courses of a spherical dome dates back thousands of years in Upper Egypt. The tholos tomb of the Sant-Antine nuraghe tower at Torralba, Sardinia Examples on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia have been dated to 2500 BC. The nuraghe built between the 17th century BC and the 5th century BC include stone corbelled domes, some of which were covered by a flat roof or terrace. Minoan free-standing tombs about 4 to 13 meters in diameter are partially preserved on the Messara Plain of Crete. Only the lowest 3 or 4 meters remain standing of structures that may have risen up to 12 meters, but they are generally agreed to have been domed and provide a developmental link between Neolithic round houses and the circular tombs of the Bronze Age. They are dated after the round houses of Chalcolithic western Cyprus and before the Mycenaean \\"tholoi\\". Underground tombs called \\"treasuries\\", a term used by Pausanias for the grave of a hero, flourished in Mycenaean Greece between 1500 BC and 1300 BC, increasing in diameter from about 8 meters to about 14 meters in that time. The \\"Treasury of Atreus\\", a large Mycenaean tomb covered with a mound of earth, dates to around 1330 BC. It is about 15 meters in diameter and one of several tholos tombs with corbelled domes. Others include the \\"Treasury of Clytemnestra\\" and the \\"Treasury of Minyas\\". Smaller scale examples from this time can also be found in other parts of southern and western Europe. Corbelled beehive tombs over square chambers appear in Thrace, the Crimea, and in Etruria in the first millennium BC. Corbelling in the corners created pendentives. Built between the eighth century and the first century BC, particularly around Tarquinia and Cerveteri, thousands of examples of Etruscan domed tombs of Italy have been identified. The Etruscan \\"Tomb of the Diavolino\\" at Vetulonia is an example. Wooden domes were evidently used in Etruria on the Italian peninsula from the Archaic period. Reproductions were preserved as rock-cut Etruscan tombs produced until the Roman Imperial period, and paintings at Pompeii show examples of them in the third style and later. Wooden domes may also have been used in ancient Greece, over buildings such as the Tholos of Epidaurus, which is typically depicted with a shallow conical roof. Evidence for such wooden domes over round buildings in ancient Greece, if they existed, has not survived and the issue is much debated. The heroon at Stymphalos has been dated to the late Classical or early Hellenistic period and has a round room preceded by a long rectilinear porch. Its layout might have been copied from Mycenaean tholos tombs and, still in use in the Roman period, it has also been suggested as an inspiration or precedent for the Pantheon in Rome.  Hellenistic and pre-Roman domes  Although they had palaces of brick and stone, the kings of Achaemenid Persia held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia. They were likely similar to the later tents of the Mongol Khans. Called \\"Heavens\\", the tents emphasized the cosmic significance of the divine ruler. They were adopted by Alexander the Great after his conquest of the empire, and the domed baldachin of Roman and Byzantine practice was presumably inspired by this association. Simple domical mausoleums existed in the Hellenistic period. The possible use of domed ceilings in the architecture of Ptolemaic Egypt is suggested by rock- cut tombs in Alexandria and by a poem from a third century BC papyrus that references a fountain niche covered with a semi-dome. The earliest physical evidence of a Hellenistic dome is at the North Baths of Morgantina in Sicily, dated to the mid third century BC. The dome measured 5.75 metres in diameter over the circular hot room of the baths. It was made of terracotta tubes partially inserted into each other and arranged in parallel arches that were then completely covered with mortar. Iron pins were used to connect some of the tubes horizontally. It is also the earliest known example of this technique of tubular vault construction. A Hellenistic bathing complex in nearby Syracuse may also have used domes like these to cover its circular rooms. The domes are contemporaneous with Archimedes, and the technique of their construction may be related to his method of analyzing spheres as a series of parallel truncated cone segments. The ship Syracusia, built for Hiero II of Syracuse and construction of which was overseen by Archimedes, included a domed library. In the city of Pergamon, there are remains of stone apsidal semi-domes from the second century BC. The earliest evidence for dressed stone domes with voussoirs comes from the first century BC in the region of Palestine, Syria, and southern Anatolia, the \\"heartland of Oriental Hellenism\\". A stone pendentive dome is known from a first century BC bath in Petra. The Scythians built domed tombs, as did some Germanic tribes in a paraboloid shape. In the Saar basin of the Germanic north of Europe, the domical shape was used in wooden construction over houses, tombs, temples, and city towers, and was translated into masonry construction only after the beginning of Roman rule. The remains of a large domed circular hall measuring 17 meters in diameter in the Parthian capital city of Nyssa has been dated to perhaps the first century AD. It \\"shows the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them.\\" It likely had a wooden dome. The room \\"contained a portrait of Mithradates II and, along with other structures at the site, hosted some sort of cult activities connected to the memory of the kings of kings.\\" The Sun Temple at Hatra appears to indicate a transition from columned halls with trabeated roofing to vaulted and domed construction in the first century AD, at least in Mesopotamia. The domed sanctuary hall of the temple was preceded by a barrel vaulted iwan, a combination that would be used by the subsequent Persian Sasanian Empire. An account of a Parthian domed palace hall from around 100 AD in the city of Babylon can be found in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana by Philostratus. The hall was used by the king for passing judgments and was decorated with a mosaic of blue stone to resemble the sky, with images of gods in gold. A bulbous Parthian dome can be seen in the relief sculpture of the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome, its shape apparently due to the use of a light tent-like framework. Ancient China Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb of Hong Kong, dated to the Eastern Han dynasty (25‚Äì220 AD). In ancient Chinese architecture, the use of brick vaults and domes in above ground structures is unknown. However, underground tombs dating to the Han dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) have been discovered and often feature archways, vaulted chambers and domed ceilings. These underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits. The continued use of domed ceilings in underground tomb architecture can be seen at sites such as the Baisha Tomb near Gongyi, Henan province, dated to the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279 AD), which features two chambers with conical ceilings.

It is unusual in the genus in that its flowers appear along long lengths of old wood.  Description  Melaleuca agathosmoides is usually a shrub growing to a height of . The leaves are glabrous, long and decussate (arranged in alternating pairs). The flowers are ramiflorous, that is they grow along lengths of old wood rather than at the ends of branches or in the axils of leaves, singly or in groups of up to 20. The stamens are grouped in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 12 to 19 stamens. The cup-shaped base of the flower (the hypanthium) is glabrous, long. The flowers are cream or white to greenish-white and appear between July and November. The fruit are woody capsules, long, with the sepals remaining as teeth around the fruits. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca agathosmoides was first formally described in 1939 by Charles Austin Gardner from a specimen collected in the Coolgardie District at \\"Hatter's Hill, north of Ravensthorpe, in red loamy gravelly soil, [flowering] Sept. 1929\\". The specific epithet (agathosmoides) is a reference to its similarity to plants in the genus Agathosma. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca is restricted to the Lake King district of Western Australia in the Mallee biogeographic region. It grows in gravelly, red clay loam on hills. Conservation status Melaleuca agathosmoides is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

They had widespread influence on contemporary and later styles, from Russian and Ottoman architecture to the Italian Renaissance and modern revivals. The domes were customarily hemispherical, although octagonal and segmented shapes are also known, and they developed in form, use, and structure over the centuries. Early examples rested directly on the rotunda walls of round rooms and featured a central oculus for ventilation and light. Pendentives became common in the Byzantine period, provided support for domes over square spaces. Early wooden domes are known only from a literary source, but the use of wooden formwork, concrete, and unskilled labor enabled domes of monumental size in the late Republic and early Imperial period, such as the so-called \\"Temple of Mercury\\" bath hall at Baiae. Nero introduced the dome into Roman palace architecture in the 1st century and such rooms served as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. The Pantheon's dome, the largest and most famous example, was built of concrete in the 2nd century and may have served as an audience hall for Hadrian. Imperial mausolea, such as the Mausoleum of Diocletian, were domed beginning in the 3rd century. Some smaller domes were built with a technique of using ceramic tubes in place of a wooden centering for concrete, or as a permanent structure embedded in the concrete, but light brick became the preferred building material over the course of the 4th and 5th centuries. Brick ribs allowed for a thinner structure and facilitated the use of windows in the supporting walls, replacing the need for an oculus as a light source. Christian baptisteries and shrines were domed in the 4th century, such as the Lateran Baptistery and the likely wooden dome over the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Constantine's octagonal church in Antioch may have been a precedent for similar buildings for centuries afterward. The first domed basilica may have been built in the 5th century, with a church in southern Turkey being the earliest proposed example, but the 6th century architecture of Justinian made domed church architecture standard throughout the Roman east. His Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Apostles inspired copies in later centuries. Cruciform churches with domes at their crossings, such as the churches of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki and St. Nicholas at Myra, were typical of 7th and 8th century architecture and bracing a dome with barrel vaults on four sides became the standard structural system. Domes over windowed drums of cylindrical or polygonal shape were standard after the 9th century. In the empire's later period, smaller churches were built with smaller diameter domes, normally less than after the 10th century. Exceptions include the 11th century domed- octagons of Hosios Loukas and Nea Moni, and the 12th century Chora Church, among others. The cross-in-square plan, with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern, as at the Church of St. Panteleimon, was the most popular type from the 10th century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.  Overview  Rounded arches, vaults, and domes distinguish Roman architecture from that of Ancient Greece and were facilitated by the use of concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused. The mortar and aggregate of Roman concrete was built up in horizontal layers laid by hand against wooden form-work with the thickness of the layers determined by the length of the workday, rather than being poured into a mold as concrete is today. Roman concrete domes were thus built similarly to the earlier corbel domes of the Mediterranean region, although they have different structural characteristics. The aggregate used by the Romans was often rubble, but lightweight aggregate in the upper levels served to reduce stresses. Empty \\"vases and jugs\\" could be hidden inside to reduce weight. The dry concrete mixtures used by the Romans were compacted with rams to eliminate voids, and added animal blood acted as a water reducer. Because Roman concrete was weak in tension, it did not provide any structural advantage over the use of brick or stone. But, because it could be constructed with unskilled slave labor, it provided a constructional advantage and facilitated the building of large-scale domes. Roman domes were used in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily hemispherical in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Domes were \\"closely associated with senatorial, imperial, and state-sponsored patrons\\" and proliferated in the capital cities and other cities with imperial affiliations. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline and fall of the western portion of the empire. In Byzantine architecture, a supporting structure of four arches with pendentives between them allowed the spaces below domes to be opened up. Pendentives allowed for weight loads to be concentrated at just four points on a more practical square plan, rather than a circle. Until the 9th century, domes were low with thick buttressing and did not project much into the exterior of their buildings. Drums were cylindrical when used and likewise low and thick. After the 9th century, domes were built higher and used polygonal drums decorated with engaged columns and arcades. Exterior dome decoration was more elaborate by the 12th century and included engaged columns along with niches, blind arcades, and string courses. Multiple domes on a single building were normal. Domes were important elements of baptisteries, churches, and tombs. They were normally hemispherical and had, with occasional exceptions, windowed drums. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. The domes and drums typically incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar and allow for faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, with the number of divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.  History  Late Republic and early Imperial period = Roman baths played a leading role in the development of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These domes are very conical in shape, similar to those on an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified from the middle of the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. Domes were particularly well suited to the hot rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD. Varro's book on agriculture describes an aviary with a wooden dome decorated with the eight winds that is compared by analogy to the eight winds depicted on the Tower of the Winds, which was built in Athens at about the same time. This aviary with its wooden dome may represent a fully developed type. Wooden domes in general would have allowed for very wide spans. Their earlier use may have inspired the development and introduction of large stone domes of previously unprecedented size. Complex wooden forms were necessary for dome centering and support during construction, and they seem to have eventually become more efficient and standardized over time. Flooded ruins of the so-called \\"Temple of Mercury\\" in Baiae Domes reached monumental size in the Roman Imperial period. Although imprints of the formwork itself have not survived, deformations from the ideal of up to at the so-called \\"Temple of Mercury\\" in Baiae suggest a centering of eight radiating frames, with horizontal connectors supporting radial formwork for the shallow dome. The building, actually a concrete bath hall dating from the age of Augustus (27 BC ‚Äì 14 AD), has the first known large Roman dome. There are five openings in the dome: a circular oculus and four square skylights. The dome has a span of and is the largest known dome built before that of the Pantheon. It is also the earliest preserved concrete dome. = First century = While there are earlier examples in the Republican period and early Imperial period, the growth of domed construction increased under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. Formwork was arranged either horizontally or radially, but there is not enough surviving evidence from the 1st and 2nd centuries to say what was typical. The octagonal domed hall found in Nero's Domus Aurea The opulent palace architecture of the Emperor Nero (54 ‚Äì 68 AD) marks an important development. There is evidence of a dome in his Domus Transitoria at the intersection of two corridors, resting on four large piers, which may have had an oculus at the center. In Nero's Domus Aurea, or \\"Golden House\\", planned by Severus and Celer, the walls of a large octagonal room transition to an octagonal domical vault, which then transitions to a dome with an oculus. This is the earliest known example of a dome in the city of Rome itself. The Domus Aurea was built after 64 AD and the dome was over in diameter. This octagonal and semicircular dome is made of concrete and the oculus is made of brick. The radial walls of the surrounding rooms buttress the dome, allowing the octagonal walls directly beneath it to contain large openings under flat arches and for the room itself to be unusually well lit. Because there is no indication that mosaic or other facing material had ever been applied to the surface of the dome, it may have been hidden behind a tent-like fabric canopy like the pavilion tents of Hellenistic (and earlier Persian) rulers. The oculus is unusually large, more than two- fifths the span of the room, and it may have served to support a lightweight lantern structure or tholos, which would have covered the opening. Circular channels on the upper surface of the oculus also support the idea that this lantern, perhaps itself domed, was the rotating dome referred to in written accounts. According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on its base in imitation of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, although it is not known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site. The only intact dome from the reign of Emperor Domitian is a wide example in what may have been a nymphaeum at his villa at Albano. It is now the church of . Domitian's 92 AD Domus Augustana established the apsidal semi-dome as an imperial motif. Square chambers in his palace on the Palatine Hill used pendentives to support domes. His palace contained three domes resting over walls with alternating apses and rectangular openings. An octagonal domed hall existed in the domestic wing. Unlike Nero's similar octagonal dome, its segments extended all the way to the oculus. The dining hall of this private palace, called the Coenatio Jovis, or Dining Hall of Jupiter, contained a rotating ceiling like the one Nero had built, but with stars set into the simulated sky. = Second century = During the reign of Emperor Trajan, domes and semi-domes over exedras were standard elements of Roman architecture, possibly due to the efforts of Trajan's architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, who was famed for his engineering ability. Two rotundas in diameter were finished in 109 AD as part of the Baths of Trajan, built over the Domus Aurea, and exedras wide were built as part of the markets north-east of his forum. The architecture of Trajan's successor, Hadrian, continued this style. Three wide exedras at Trajan's Baths have patterns of coffering that, as in the later Pantheon, align with lower niches only on the axes and diagonals and, also as in the Pantheon, that alignment is sometimes with the ribs between the coffers, rather than with the coffers themselves. The Pantheon in Rome The Pantheon in Rome, completed by Emperor Hadrian as part of the Baths of Agrippa, has the most famous, best preserved, and largest Roman dome. Its diameter was more than twice as wide as any known earlier dome. Although considered an example of Hadrianic architecture, there is brickstamp evidence that the rebuilding of the Pantheon in its present form was begun under Trajan. Speculation that the architect of the Pantheon was Apollodorus has not been proven, although there are stylistic commonalities between his large coffered half-domes at Trajan's Baths and the dome of the Pantheon. Dating from the 2nd century, it is an unreinforced concrete dome wide resting on a circular wall, or rotunda, thick. This rotunda, made of brick-faced concrete, contains a large number of relieving arches and voids. Seven interior niches and the entrance way divide the wall structurally into eight virtually independent piers. These openings and additional voids account for a quarter of the rotunda wall's volume. The only opening in the dome is the brick-lined oculus at the top, in diameter, that provides light and ventilation for the interior. The shallow coffering in the dome accounts for a less than five percent reduction in the dome's mass, and is mostly decorative. The aggregate material hand-placed in the concrete is heaviest at the base of the dome and changes to lighter materials as the height increases, dramatically reducing the stresses in the finished structure. In fact, many commentators have cited the Pantheon as an example of the revolutionary possibilities for monolithic architecture provided by the use of Roman pozzolana concrete. However, vertical cracks seem to have developed very early, such that in practice the dome acts as an array of arches with a common keystone, rather than as a single unit. The exterior step-rings used to compress the \\"haunches\\" of the dome, which would not be necessary if the dome acted as a monolithic structure, may be an acknowledgement of this by the builders themselves. Such buttressing was common in Roman arch construction. The cracks in the dome can be seen from the upper internal chambers of the rotunda, but have been covered by re-rendering on the inside surface of the dome and by patching on the outside of the building. The Pantheon's roof was originally covered with gilt bronze tiles, but these were removed in 663 by Emperor Constans II and replaced with lead roofing. The function of the Pantheon remains an open question. Strangely for a temple, its inscription, which attributes this third building at the site to the builder of the first, Marcus Agrippa, does not mention any god or group of gods. Its name, Pantheon, comes from the Greek for \\"all gods\\" but is unofficial, and it was not included in the list of temples restored by Hadrian in the Historia Augusta. Circular temples were small and rare, and Roman temples traditionally allowed for only one divinity per room. The Pantheon more resembles structures found in imperial palaces and baths. Hadrian is believed to have held court in the rotunda using the main apse opposite the entrance as a tribune, which may explain its very large size. Later Roman buildings similar to the Pantheon include a (c. 145) in the old Hellenistic city of Pergamon and the so-called \\"Round Temple\\" at Ostia (c. 230‚Äì240), which may have been related to the Imperial cult. The Pergamon dome was about 80 Roman feet wide, versus about 150 for the Pantheon, and made of brick over a cut stone rotunda. The Ostia dome was 60 Roman feet wide and made of brick-faced concrete. No later dome built in the Imperial era came close to the span of the Pantheon. It remained the largest dome in the world for more than a millennium and is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. Ruins in the Piazza D'Oro at Hadrian's Villa Use of concrete facilitated the complex geometry of the octagonal domed hall at the 2nd century Small Thermal Baths of Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. The vaulting has collapsed, but a virtual reconstruction suggests that the walls of the octagonal hall, which alternate flat and convex, merged into a spherical cap. Segmented domes made of radially concave wedges, or of alternating concave and flat wedges, appear under Hadrian in the 2nd century and most preserved examples of the style date from this period. Hadrian's villa has examples at the Piazza D'Oro and in the semidome of the Serapeum. Recorded details of the decoration of the segmented dome at the Piazza D'Oro suggests it was made to evoke a billowing tent, perhaps in imitation of the canopies used by Hellenistic kings. Other examples exist at the Hadrianic baths of Otricoli and the so-called \\"Temple of Venus\\" at Baiae. This style of dome required complex centering and radially oriented formwork to create its tight curves, and the earliest surviving direct evidence of radial formwork is found at the caldarium of the Large Baths at Hadrian's villa. Hadrian was an amateur architect and it was apparently domes of Hadrian's like these that Trajan's architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, derisively called \\"pumpkins\\" prior to Hadrian becoming emperor. According to Dio Cassius, the memory of this insult contributed to Hadrian as emperor having Apollodorus exiled and killed. In the middle of the 2nd century, some of the largest domes were built near present-day Naples, as part of large bath complexes taking advantage of the volcanic hot springs in the area. At the bath complex at Baiae, there are remains of a collapsed dome spanning , called the \\"Temple of Venus\\", and a larger half-collapsed dome spanning called the \\"Temple of Diana\\". The dome of the \\"Temple of Diana\\", which may have been a nymphaeum as part of the bath complex, can be seen to have had an ogival section made of horizontal layers of mortared brick and capped with light tufa. It dates to the second half of the 2nd century and is the third largest dome known from the Roman world. The second largest is the collapsed \\"Temple of Apollo\\" built nearby along the shore of Lake Avernus. The span cannot be precisely measured due to its ruined state, but it was more than in diameter. Octagonal rooms of the Baths of Antoninus in Carthage were covered with cloister vaults and have been dated to 145‚Äì160. In the second half of the 2nd century in North Africa, a distinctive type of nozzle tube shape was developed in the tradition of the terracotta tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of Morgantina, an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking terracotta pots for kiln roofs. This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean. Although rarely used, the pendentive dome was known in 2nd century Roman architecture, such as the funerary monuments of the Sedia dei Diavolo and the Torracio della Secchina on the Via Nomentana. It would be used much more widely in the Byzantine period. A \\"Roman tomb in Palestine at Kusr-en-N√™uij√Æs\\" had a pendentive dome over the square intersection of cruciform barrel vaults and has been dated to the 2nd century. = Third century = Ruins at Villa Gordiani The large rotunda of the Baths of Agrippa, the oldest public baths in Rome, has been dated to the Severan period at the beginning of the 3rd century, but it is not known whether this is an addition or simply a reconstruction of an earlier domed rotunda. In the 3rd century, imperial mausolea began to be built as domed rotundas rather than tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. Pagan and Christian domed mausolea from this time can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings also reflect their religious functions. The pagan buildings are typically two story, dimly lit, free-standing structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice. Christian domed mausolea contain a single well-lit space and are usually attached to a church. The first St. Peter's Basilica would later be built near a preexisting early 3rd century domed rotunda that may have been a mausoleum. In the 5th century the rotunda would be dedicated to St. Andrew and joined to the Mausoleum of Honorius. Examples from the 3rd century include the brick dome of the Mausoleum of Diocletian, and the mausoleum at Villa Gordiani. The Villa Gordiani also contains remains of an oval gored dome. The Mausoleum of Diocletian uses small arched squinches of brick built up from a circular base in an overlapping scales pattern, called a \\"stepped squinches dome\\". The scales pattern was a popular Hellenistic motif adopted by the Parthians and Sasanians, and such domes are likely related to Persian \\"squinch vaults\\". In addition to the mausoleum, the Palace of Diocletian also contains a rotunda near the center of the complex that may have served as a throne room. It has side niches similar to those of an octagonal mausoleum but was located at the end of an apparently barrel-vaulted hall like the arrangement found in later Sasanian palaces. Masonry domes were less common in the Roman provinces, although the 3rd century \\"Temple of Venus\\" at Baalbek was built with a stone dome in diameter. The technique of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example. = Fourth century = Temple of Minerva Medica\\" in Rome In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due to changes in the way domes were constructed, including advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing. The so-called \\"Temple of Minerva Medica\\", for example, used brick ribs along with step-rings and lightweight pumice aggregate concrete to form a decagonal dome. The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. The use of ribs stiffened the structure, allowing domes to be thinner with less massive supporting walls. Windows were often used in these walls and replaced the oculus as a source of light, although buttressing was sometimes necessary to compensate for large openings. The Mausoleum of Santa Costanza has windows beneath the dome and nothing but paired columns beneath that, using a surrounding barrel vault to buttress the structure. The dome of the Mausoleum of Galerius was built around 300 AD close to the imperial palace as either a mausoleum or a throne room. It was converted into a church in the 5th century. Also in Thessaloniki, at the Tetrarchic palace, an octagonal building has been excavated with a 24.95 meter span that may have been used as a throne room. It is known not to have been used as a church and was unsuitable as a mausoleum, and was used for some period between about 311 and when it was destroyed before about 450. The octagonal \\"Domus Aurea\\", or \\"Golden Octagon\\", built by Emperor Constantine in 327 at the imperial palace of Antioch likewise had a domical roof, presumably of wood and covered with gilded lead. It was dedicated two years after the Council of Nicea to \\"Harmony, the divine power that unites Universe, Church, and Empire\\". It may have been both the cathedral of Antioch as well as the court church of Constantine, and the precedent for the later octagonal plan churches near palaces of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and Hagia Sophia by Justinian and Aachen Cathedral by Charlemagne. The dome was rebuilt by 537‚Äì8 with cypress wood from Daphne after being destroyed in a fire. Most domes on churches in the Syrian region were built of wood, like that of the later Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and the dome of the Domus Aurea survived a series of earthquakes in the 6th century that destroyed the rest of the building. There is no record of the church being rebuilt after the earthquake of 588, perhaps due to the general abandonment of many public buildings in what was no longer a capital of the Empire. St. George Rotunda and some remains of Serdica can be seen in the foreground Centralized buildings of circular or octagonal plan also became used for baptistries and reliquaries due to the suitability of those shapes for assembly around a single object. Baptisteries began to be built in the manner of domed mausolea during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran Baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. Examples include the (late 4th century), a domed baptistery in Naples (4th to 6th centuries), and a baptistery in Aquileia (late 4th century). Part of a baths complex begun in the early 4th century, the brick Church of St. George in Sofia was a caldarium that was converted in the middle of the fifth century. It is a rotunda with four apse niches in the corners. The best preserved example of Roman architecture in the city, it has been used as a baptistery, church, mosque, and mausoleum over the centuries. The dome rises to about 14 m from the floor with a diameter of about 9.5m. In the middle of the 4th century in Rome, domes were built as part of the Baths of Constantine and the . Domes over the calderia, or hot rooms, of the older Baths of Agrippa and the Baths of Caracalla were also rebuilt at this time. Between the second half of the 4th century and the middle of the 5th century, domed mausolea for wealthy families were built attached to a new type of martyrial basilica before burials within the basilica itself, closer to the martyr's remains, made such attached buildings obsolete. A pagan rotunda from this period located on the Via Sacra was later incorporated into the Basilica of Saints Cosmas and Damian as a vestibule around 526. Christian mausolea and shrines developed into the \\"centralized church\\" type, often with a dome over a raised central space. The Church of the Holy Apostles, or Apostoleion, probably planned by Constantine but built by his successor Constantius in the new capital city of Constantinople, combined the congregational basilica with the centralized shrine. With a similar plan to that of the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, four naves projected from a central rotunda containing Constantine's tomb and spaces for the tombs of the twelve Apostles. Above the center may have been a clerestory with a wooden dome roofed with bronze sheeting and gold accents. The oblong decagon of today's St. Gereon's Basilica in Cologne, Germany, was built upon an extraordinary and richly decorated 4th century Roman building with an apse, semi-domed niches, and dome. A church built in the city's northern cemetery, its original dedication is unknown. It may have been built by Julianus, the governor of Gaul from 355 to 360 who would later become emperor, as a mausoleum for his family. The oval space may have been patterned after imperial audience halls or buildings such as the Temple of Minerva Medica. The largest centrally planned Early Christian church, Milan's San Lorenzo Maggiore, was built in the middle of the 4th century while that city served as the capital of the Western Empire and may have been domed with a light material, such as timber or cane. There are two theories about the shape of this dome: a Byzantine-style dome on spherical pendentives with a ring of windows similar to domes of the later Justinian era, or an octagonal cloister vault following Roman trends and like the vaulting over the site's contemporary chapel of Saint Aquiline, possibly built with vaulting tubes, pieces of which had been found in excavations. Although these tubes have been shown to date from a medieval reconstruction, there is evidence supporting the use of Roman concrete in the original. Alternatively, the central covering may have been a square groin vault. Fires in 1071 and 1075 damaged the building and the central covering collapsed in 1103. It was rebuilt with a Romanesque dome that lasted until 1573, when it collapsed and was replaced by the present structure. The original vaulting was concealed by a square drum externally rather than the octagon of today, which dates from the 16th century. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was likely built with a wooden dome over the shrine by the end of the 4th century. The rotunda, in diameter and centered on the tomb of Christ, consisted of a domed center room surrounded by an ambulatory. The dome rose over a ground floor, gallery, and clerestory and may have had an oculus. The dome was about wide. Razed to the ground in 1009 by the Fatimid Caliph, it was rebuilt in 1048 by Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, reportedly with a mosaic depicting Christ and the Twelve Apostles. The current dome is a 1977 renovation in thin reinforced concrete. = Fifth century = The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna By the 5th century, structures with small-scale domed cross plans existed across the Christian world. Examples include the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the martyrium attached to the Basilica of San Simpliciano, and churches in Macedonia and on the coast of Asia Minor. In Italy, the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Naples and the Church of Santa Maria della Croce in Casarano have surviving early Christian domes. In Tolentino, the mausoleum of Catervus was modeled on the Pantheon, but at one-quarter scale and with three protruding apses, around 390-410. The Baptistery of Neon in Ravenna was completed in the middle of the 5th century and there were 5th century domes in the baptisteries at Padula and Novara. Small brick domes are also found in towers of Constantinople's early 5th century land walls. Underground cisterns in Constantinople, such as the Cistern of Philoxenos and the Basilica Cistern, were composed of a grid of columns supporting small domes, rather than groin vaults. The square bay with an overhead sail vault or dome on pendentives became the basic unit of architecture in the early Byzantine centuries, found in a variety of combinations. Early examples of Byzantine domes existed over the hexagonal hall of the Palace of Antiochos, the hexagon at G√ºlhane, the martyium of Sts. Karpos and Papylos, and the rotunda at the Myrelaion. The 5th century St. Mary's church in Ephesus had small rectangular side rooms with sail vaults made of arched brick courses. The brick dome of the baptistery at St. Mary's was composed of a series of tightly arched meridional sections. The Church of Saint Simeon Stylites likely had a wooden polygonal dome over its central wide octagon. In the city of Rome, at least 58 domes in 44 buildings are known to have been built before domed construction ended in the middle of the 5th century. The last imperial domed mausoleum in the city was that of Emperor Honorius, built in 415 next to St. Peter's Basilica. It was demolished in 1519 as part of the rebuilding of St. Peter's, but had a dome 15.7 meters wide and its appearance is known from some images. The last domed church in the city of Rome for centuries was Santo Stefano al Monte Celio around 460. It had an unusual centralized plan and a 22 meter wide dome made with , a technique that may have been imported from the new western capital of Ravenna. Although they continued to be built elsewhere in Italy, domes would not be built again within the city until 1453. Other 5th century Italian domes may include (first half of the 5th century), the at the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, the chapel of St. Maria Mater Domini in the , and Sicily's of Malvagna (5th or 6th century) and San Pietro ad Baias (5th or 6th century). With the end of the Western Roman Empire, domes became a signature feature of the church architecture of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire. A transition from timber- roofed basilicas to vaulted churches seems to have occurred there between the late 5th century and the 7th century, with early examples in Constantinople, Asia Minor, and Cilicia. The first known domed basilica may have been a church at Meriamlik in southern Turkey, dated to between 471 and 494, although the ruins do not provide a definitive answer. It is possible earlier examples existed in Constantinople, where it has been suggested that the plan for the Meriamlik church itself was designed, but no domed basilica has been found there before the 6th century. = Sixth century = The 6th century marks a turning point for domed church architecture. Centrally planned domed churches had been built since the 4th century for very particular functions, such as palace churches or martyria, with a slight widening of use around 500 AD, but most church buildings were timber-roofed halls on the basilica plan. The Church of St. Polyeuctus in Constantinople (524‚Äì527) may have been built as a large and lavish domed basilica similar to the Meriamlik church of fifty years before‚Äîand to the later Hagia Irene of Emperor Justinian‚Äîby Anicia Juliana, a descendant of the former imperial house, although the linear walls suggest a timber roof, rather than a brick dome. There is a story that she used the contribution to public funds that she had promised Justinian on his ascension to the throne to roof her church in gold. The church included an inscription praising Juliana for having \\"surpassed Solomon\\" with the building, and it may have been with this in mind that Justinian would later say of his Hagia Sophia, \\"Solomon, I have vanquished thee!\\". In the second third of the 6th century, church building by the Emperor Justinian used the domed cross unit on a monumental scale, in keeping with Justinian's emphasis on bold architectural innovation. His church architecture emphasized the central dome and his architects made the domed brick-vaulted central plan standard throughout the Roman east. This divergence with the Roman west from the second third of the 6th century may be considered the beginning of a \\"Byzantine\\" architecture. Timber-roofed basilicas, which had previously been the standard church form, would continue to be so in the medieval west. The earliest existing of Justinian's domed buildings may be the central plan Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople, completed by 536. It is called the \\"Little Hagia Sophia\\" mosque today, but may have been begun five years earlier than that building. The dome rests on an octagonal base created by eight arches on piers and is divided into sixteen sections. Those sections above the flat sides of the octagon are flat and contain a window at their base, alternating with sections from the corners of the octagon that are scalloped, creating an unusual kind of pumpkin dome. Its dates of construction are disputed and may have begun in 532. The alternating scalloped and flat surfaces of the current dome resemble those in Hadrian's half-dome Serapeum in Tivoli, but may have replaced an original drum and dome similar to that over the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. The building was built within the precinct of the Palace of Hormistas, the residence of Justinian before his ascension to the throne in 527, and includes an inscription mentioning the \\"sceptered Justinian\\" and \\"God-crowned Theodora\\". The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul (annotations). After the Nika Revolt destroyed much of the city of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia (\\"Holy Wisdom\\") and Hagia Irene (\\"Holy Peace\\"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale. Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and, according to contemporary accounts, much bolder. Procopius wrote that the original dome seemed \\"not to rest upon solid masonry, but to cover the space with its golden dome suspended from heaven.\\" Byzantine chronicler John Malalas reported that this dome was 20 byzantine feet lower than its replacement. One theory is that the original dome continued the curve of the existing pendentives (which were partially reconstructed after its collapse), creating a massive sail vault pierced with a ring of windows. This vault would have been part of a theoretical sphere in diameter (the distance from the base of one pendentive to the base of the one opposite), 7 percent greater than the span of the Pantheon's dome. Another theory raises the shallow cap of this dome (the portion above what are today the pendentives) on a relatively short recessed drum containing the windows. This first dome partially collapsed due to an earthquake in 558 and the design was then revised to the present profile. Earthquakes also caused partial collapses of the dome in 989 and 1346, so that the present dome consists of portions dating from the 6th century, on the north and south sides, and portions from the 10th and 14th centuries on the west and east sides, respectively. There are irregularities where these sectors meet. The current central dome, above the pendentives, is about thick. It is about wide and contains 40 radial ribs that spring from between the 40 windows at its base. Four of the windows were blocked as part of repairs in the 10th century. The ring of windows at the base of the central dome are in the portion where the greatest hoop tension would have been expected and so they may have been used to help alleviate cracking along the meridians. Iron cramps between the marble blocks of its cornice helped to reduce outward thrusts at the base and limit cracking, like the wooden tension rings used in other Byzantine brick domes. The dome and pendentives are supported by four large arches springing from four piers. Additionally, two huge semi-domes of similar proportion are placed on opposite sides of the central dome and themselves contain smaller semi-domes between an additional four piers. The Hagia Sophia, as both the cathedral of Constantinople and the church of the adjacent Great Palace of Constantinople, has a form of octagonal plan. The Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna The city of Ravenna, Italy, had served as the capital of the Western Roman Empire after Milan from 402 and the capital of the subsequent kingdoms of Odoacer and of Theodoric until Justinian's reconquest in 540. The octagonal Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, begun under Theodoric in 525, was completed under the Byzantines in 547 and contains a terracotta dome. It may belong to a school of architecture from 4th and 5th century Milan. The building is similar to the Byzantine Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the later Chrysotriklinos, or throne hall and palace church of Constantinople, and it would be used as the model for Charlemagne's palace chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle. Hollow amphorae were fitted inside one another to provide a lightweight structure for the dome and avoid additional buttressing. It is in diameter. The amphorae were arranged in a continuous spiral, which required minimal centering and formwork but was not strong enough for large spans. The dome was covered with a timber roof, which would be the favored practice for later medieval architects in Italy although it was unusual at the time. In Constantinople, Justinian also tore down the aging Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550. The original building was a cruciform basilica with a central domed mausoleum. Justinian's replacement was apparently likewise cruciform but with a central dome and four flanking domes. The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base, while the four domes over the arms of the cross had pendentives but no windows. The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others. The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia, it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site. Justinian's Basilica of St. John at Ephesus and Venice's St Mark's Basilica are derivative of Holy Apostles. More loosely, the Cathedral of St. Front and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church. Justinian and his successors modernized frontier fortifications throughout the century. The example at Qasr ibn Wardan (564) in the desert of eastern Syria is particularly impressive, containing a governor's palace, barracks, and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople. The church dome is unusual in that the pendentives sprang from an octagonal drum, rather than the four main arches, and in that it was made of brick, which was rare in Syria. The Golden Triclinium, or Chrysotriklinos, of the Great Palace of Constantinople served as an audience hall for the Emperor as well as a palace chapel. Nothing of it has survived except descriptions, which indicate that it had a pumpkin dome containing sixteen windows in its webs and that the dome was supported by the arches of eight niches connecting to adjoining rooms in the building's likely circular plan. Alternatively, the building may have been octagonal in plan, rather than circular. The building was not free-standing and was located at the intersection of the public and private parts of the palace. Smaller windows filled with thin sheets of alabaster may have existed over each of the curtain-covered side niches and below the cornice at the base of the dome. The dome seems to have had webs that alternated straight and concave, like those of the dome of Justinian's Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, and may have been built about 40 years after that church. It was begun under Emperor Justin II, completed by his successor Tiberius II, and continued to be improved by subsequent rulers. It was connected to the imperial living quarters and was a space used for assembly before religious festivals, high promotions and consultations, as a banqueting hall, a chapel for the emperor, and a throne room. Never fully described in any of its frequent mentions in Byzantine texts, the room was restricted to members of the court and the \\"most highly rated foreigners\\". In the 10th century, the throne in the east niche chamber was directly below an icon of an enthroned Christ. Other 6th century examples of domed constructions may include Nostra Segnora de Mesumundu in Siligo, Sardinia (before 534), Sant‚ÄôAngelo in Perugia, near San Donaci (6th or 7th century), and the Trigona of Cittadella near Noto (6th or 7th century). = Seventh and eighth centuries = The period of Iconoclasm, roughly corresponding to the 7th to 9th centuries, is poorly documented but can be considered a transitional period. The cathedral of Sofia has an unsettled date of construction, ranging from the last years of Justinian to the middle of the 7th century, as the Balkans were lost to the Slavs and Bulgars. It combines a barrel-vaulted cruciform basilica plan with a crossing dome hidden externally by the drum. It resembles some Romanesque churches of later centuries, although the type would not be popular in later Byzantine architecture. Part of the 5th century basilica of St. Mary at Ephesus seems to have been rebuilt in the 8th century as a cross-domed church, a development typical of the 7th to 8th centuries and similar to the cross-domed examples of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, St. Nicholas at Myra, St. Clement's at Ankara, and the church of the Koimesis at Nicaea. The Hagia Irene in Istanbul With the decline in the empire's resources following losses in population and territory, domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings. The large-scale churches of Byzantium were, however, kept in good repair. The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after the 740 Constantinople earthquake. The nave was re-covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof, in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum. The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles, creating cross-domed units. By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides, the cross-domed unit provided a more secure structural system. These units, with most domes raised on drums, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture, and all domes built after the transitional period were braced with bilateral symmetry. A small, unisex monastic community in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may have developed the cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain the small size of subsequent building. = Ninth century = Timber-roofed basilicas, which had been the standard form until the 6th century, would be displaced by domed churches from the 9th century onward. In the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843 ‚Äì 1204), domes were normally built to emphasize separate functional spaces, rather than as the modular ceiling units they had been earlier. Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics. The cross-in-square plan, with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period. Examples include an early 9th century church in Tirilye, now called the Fatih Mosque, and the palace chapel of the Myrelaion, built around 920. The Nea Ekklesia of Emperor Basil I was built in Constantinople around 880 as part of a substantial building renovation and construction program during his reign. It had five domes, which are known from literary sources, but different arrangements for them have been proposed under at least four different plans. One has the domes arranged in a cruciform pattern like those of the contemporaneous Church of St. Andrew at Peristerai or the much older Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Others arrange them in a quincunx pattern, with four minor domes in the corners of a square and a larger fifth in the center, as part of a cross-domed or cross-in-square plan. It is often suggested that the five-domed design of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi, from 1164, is based on that of the Nea Ekklesia. = Tenth century = The Hosios Loukas Panagia church near Distomo, Greece In the Middle Byzantine period, more complex plans emerge, such as the integrated chapels of Theotokos of Lips, a monastic church in Constantinople that was built around 907. It included four small chapels on its second floor gallery level that may have been domed. The cross-in-square is the most common church plan from the 10th century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. This type of plan, with four columns supporting the dome at the crossing, was best suited for domes less than wide and, from the 10th to the 14th centuries, a typical Byzantine dome measured less than in diameter. For domes beyond that width, variations in the plan were required such as using piers in place of the columns and incorporating further buttressing around the core of the building. The palace chapel of the Myrelaion in Constantinople was built around 920 as a cross-in-square church and remains a good example. The earliest cross-in-square in Greece is the Panagia church at the monastery of Hosios Loukas, dated to the late 10th century, but variations of the type can be found from southern Italy to Russia and Anatolia. They served in a wide variety of church roles, including domestic, parish, monastic, palatial, and funerary. The distinctive rippling eaves design for the roofs of domes began in the 10th century. In mainland Greece, circular or octagonal drums became the most common. = Eleventh century = The katholikon of the monastery of Hosios Loukas near Distomo, Greece In Constantinople, drums with twelve or fourteen sides were popular beginning in the 11th century. The 11th century rock-cut churches of Cappadocia, such as Karanlik Kilise and Elmali Kilise in G√∂reme, have shallow domes without drums due to the dim natural lighting of cave interiors. The domed-octagon plan is a variant of the cross-in-square plan. The earliest extant example is the katholikon at the monastery of Hosios Loukas, with a wide dome built in the first half of the 11th century. This hemispherical dome was built without a drum and supported by a remarkably open structural system, with the weight of the dome distributed on eight piers, rather than four, and corbelling used to avoid concentrating weight on their corners. The use of squinches to transition from those eight supports to the base of the dome has led to speculation of a design origin in Arab, Sasanian, or Caucasian architecture, although with a Byzantine interpretation. Similar openness in design was used in the earlier Myrelaion church, as originally built, but the katholikon of Hosios Loukas is perhaps the most sophisticated design since the Hagia Sophia. The smaller monastic church at Daphni, c. 1080, uses a simpler version of this plan. The katholikon of Nea Moni, a monastery on the island of Chios, was built some time between 1042 and 1055 and featured a nine sided, ribbed dome rising above the floor (this collapsed in 1881 and was replaced with the slightly taller present version). The transition from the square naos to the round base of the drum is accomplished by eight conches, with those above the flat sides of the naos being relatively shallow and those in the corners of the being relatively narrow. The novelty of this technique in Byzantine architecture has led to it being dubbed the \\"island octagon\\" type, in contrast to the \\"mainland octagon\\" type of Hosios Loukas. Speculation on design influences have ranged from Arab influence transmitted via the recently built domed octagon chapels at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem or the Al-Hakim Mosque in Islamic Cairo, to Caucasian buildings such as the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Later copies of the Nea Moni, with alterations, include the churches of Agios Georgios Sykousis, Agioi Apostoli at Pyrghi, Panagia Krina, and the Church of the Metamorphosis in Chortiatis. = Twelfth century = Kalenderhane Mosque in Istanbul The larger scale of some Byzantine buildings of the 12th century required a more stable support structure for domes than the four slender columns of the cross-in-square type could provide. The Byzantine churches today called Kalenderhane Mosque, G√ºl Mosque, and the Enez Fatih mosque all had domes greater than in diameter and used piers as part of large cruciform plans, a practice that had been out of fashion for several centuries. A variant of the cross-in-square, the \\"so- called atrophied Greek cross plan\\", also provides greater support for a dome than the typical cross-in-square plan by using four piers projecting from the corners of an otherwise square naos, rather than four columns. This design was used in the Chora Church of Constantinople in the 12th century after the previous cross-in-square structure was destroyed by an earthquake. The 12th century Pantokrator monastic complex (1118‚Äì36) was built with imperial sponsorship as three adjoining churches. The south church, a cross-in-square, has a ribbed dome over the naos, domical vaults in the corners, and a pumpkin dome over the narthex gallery. The north church is also a cross-in-square plan. The middle church, the third to be built, fills the long space between the two earlier churches with two oval domes of the pumpkin and ribbed types over what appear to be separate functional spaces. The western space was an imperial mausoleum, whereas the eastern dome covered a liturgical space. There is a written account by Nicholas Mesarites of a Persian-style muqarnas dome built as part of a late 12th century imperial palace in Constantinople. Called the \\"Mouchroutas Hall\\", it may have been built as part of an easing in tensions between the court of Manuel I Komnenos and Kilij Arslan II of the Sultanate of Rum around 1161, evidence of the complex nature of the relations between the two states. The account, written by Nicholas Mesarites shortly before the Fourth Crusade, is part of a description of the coup attempt by John Komnenos in 1200, and may have been mentioned as a rhetorical device to disparage him. = Thirteenth century = The Church of the Parigoritissa in Arta, Greece The Late Byzantine Period, from 1204 to 1453, has an unsettled chronology of buildings, especially during the Latin Occupation. The fragmentation of the empire, beginning in 1204, is reflected in a fragmentation of church design and regional innovations. The church of Hagia Sophia in the Empire of Trebizond dates to between 1238 and 1263 and has a variation on the quincunx plan. Heavy with traditional detailing from Asia Minor, and possibly Armenian or Georgian influence, the brick pendentives and drum of the dome remain Byzantine. After 1261, new church architecture in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions to existing monastic churches, such as the Monastery of Lips and Pammakaristos Church, and as a result the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs. This effect may have been in imitation of the earlier triple- church Pantokrator monastic complex. In the Despotate of Epirus, the Church of the Parigoritissa (1282‚Äì9) is the most complex example, with a domed octagon core and domed ambulatory. Built in the capital of Arta, its external appearance resembles a cubic palace. The upper level narthex and galleries have five domes, with the middle dome of the narthex an open lantern. This Greek-cross octagon design, similar to the earlier example at Daphni, is one of several among the various Byzantine principalities. Another is found in the Hagia Theodoroi at Mistra (1290‚Äì6). = Fourteenth and fifteenth centuries = The Graƒçanica monastery in Kosovo, built under the medieval Kingdom of Serbia Mistra was ruled from Constantinople after 1262, then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460. In Mistra, there are several basilica plan churches with domed galleries that create a five-domed cross-in- square over a ground-level basilica plan. The Aphentiko at Brontochion Monastery was built c. 1310‚Äì22 and the later church of the Pantanassa Monastery (1428) is of the same type. The Aphentiko may have been originally planned as a cross-in-square church, but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components, with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a basilica. The barrel-vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing, and the corner bays of the galleries are also domed to form a quincunx pattern. A remodeling of the Metropolis church in Mistra created an additional example. The Pantanassa incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally, and its domes have ribs of rectangular section similar to those of Salerno, Ravello, and Palermo. In Thessaloniki, a distinctive type of church dome developed in the first two decades of the 14th century. It is characterized by a polygonal drum with rounded colonnettes at the corners, all brick construction, and faces featuring three arches stepped back within one another around a narrow \\"single-light window\\". One of the hallmarks of Thessalonian churches was the plan of a domed naos with a peristoon wrapped around three sides. The churches of Hagios Panteleimon, Hagia Aikaterine, and Hagioi Apostoloi have domes on these ambulatory porticoes. The five domes of the Hagioi Apostoloi, or Church of the Holy Apostles, in Thessaloniki (c. 1329) makes it an example of a five- domed cross-in-square church in the Late Byzantine style, as is the Graƒçanica monastery, built around 1311 in Serbia. The architect and artisans of the Graƒçanica monastery church probably came from Thessaloniki and its style reflects Byzantine cultural influence. The church has been said to represent \\"the culmination of Late Byzantine architectural design.\\" A 15th century account of a Russian traveler to Constantinople mentions an abandoned hall, presumably domed, \\"in which the sun, the moon, and the stars succeeded each other as in heaven.\\"  Influence  Armenia = Constantinople's cultural influence extended from Sicily to Russia. Armenia, as a border state between the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian empires, was influenced by both. The exact relationship between Byzantine architecture and that of the Caucasus is unclear. Georgia and Armenia produced many central planned, domed buildings in the 7th century and, after a lull during the Arab invasions, the architecture flourished again in the Middle Byzantine Period. Armenian church domes were initially wooden structures. Etchmiadzin Cathedral (c. 483) originally had a wooden dome covered by a wooden pyramidal roof before this was replaced with stone construction in 618. Churches with stone domes became the standard type after the 7th century, perhaps benefiting from a possible exodus of stonecutters from Syria, but the long traditions of wooden construction carried over stylistically. Some examples in stone as late as the 12th century are detailed imitations of clearly wooden prototypes. Armenian church building was prolific in the late 6th and 7th centuries and, by the 7th century, the churches tend to be either central plans or combinations of central and longitudinal plans. Domes were supported by either squinches (which were used in the Sasanian Empire but rarely in the Byzantine) or pendentives like those of the Byzantine empire, and the combination of domed-cross plan with the hall-church plan could have been influenced by the architecture of Justinian. Domes and cross arms were added to the longitudinal cathedral of Dvin from 608 to 615 and a church in Tekor. Other domed examples include Ptghnavank in Ptghni (c. 600), a church in T'alinn (662-85), the Cathedral of Mren (629-40), and the Mastara Church (9th and 10th centuries). An 11th century Armenian source names an Armenian architect, Trdat, as responsible for the rebuilding of the dome of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople after the 989 earthquake caused a partial collapse of the central dome. Although squinches were the more common supporting system used to support Armenian domes, pendentives are always used beneath the domes attributed to Trdat, which include the 10th century monasteries of Marmasen, Sanahin, and Halpat, as well as the patriarchal cathedral of Argina (c. 985), the Cathedral of Ani (989-1001), and the palace chapel of King Gagik II (c. 1001-1005). = The Balkans = In the Balkans, where Byzantine rule weakened in the 7th and 8th centuries, domed architecture may represent Byzantine influence or, in the case of the centrally planned churches of 9th-century Dalmatia, the revival of earlier Roman mausoleum types. An interest in Roman models may have been an expression of the religious maneuvering of the region between the Church of Constantinople and that of Rome. Examples include the Church of Sv. Luka in Kotor, the Church of Sv. Trojce near Split, and the early 9th century Church of Sv. Donat in Zadar. The Church of Sv. Donat, originally domed, may have been built next to a palace and resembles palace churches in the Byzantine tradition. The architectural chronology of the central and eastern Balkans is unsettled during the period of the First Bulgarian Empire, in part because of similarity between Justinian-era churches from the 6th century and what may have been a revival of that style in the late 9th and early 10th centuries under the Christianized Bulgarian tsars. Remains of the Round Church in Preslav, a building traditionally associated with the rule Tsar Simeon (893‚Äì927), indicate that it was a domed palace chapel. Its construction features, however, resemble instead 3rd and 4th century Roman mausolea, perhaps due to the association of those structures with the imperial idea. = The Rus = Byzantine architecture was introduced to the Rus' people in the 10th century, with churches after the conversion of Prince Vladimir of Kiev being modeled after those of Constantinople, but made of wood. The Russian onion dome was a later development. The earliest architecture of Kiev, the vast majority of which was made of wood, has been lost to fire, but by the 12th century masonry domes on low drums in Kiev and Vladimir-Suzdal were little different than Byzantine domes, although modified toward the \\"helmet\\" type with a slight point. The Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev (1018‚Äì37) was distinctive in having thirteen domes, for Jesus and the twelve Apostles, but they have since been remodeled in the Baroque style and combined with an additional eight domes. The pyramidal arrangement of the domes was a Byzantine characteristic, although, as the largest and perhaps most important 11th century building in the Byzantine tradition, many of the details of this building have disputed origins. Bulbous onion domes on tall drums were a development of northern Russia, perhaps due to the demands of heavy ice and snowfall along with the more rapid innovation permitted by the Novgorod region's emphasis on wooden architecture. The central dome of the Cathedral of St. Sophia (1045‚Äì62) in Novgorod dates from the 12th century and shows a transitional stage. Other churches built around this time are those of St. Nicholas (1113), the Nativity of the Virgin (1117), and St. George (1119‚Äì30). = Romanesque Europe = In Romanesque Italy, Byzantine influence can most clearly be seen in Venice's St Mark's Basilica, from about 1063, but also in the domed churches of southern Italy, such as Canosa Cathedral (1071) and the (c. 1160). In Norman Sicily, architecture was a fusion of Byzantine, Islamic, and Romanesque forms, but the dome of the Palatine Chapel (1132‚Äì43) at Palermo was decorated with Byzantine mosaic, as was that of the church of Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio (1140s). The unusual use of domes on pendentives in a series of seventy Romanesque churches in the Aquitaine region of France strongly suggests a Byzantine influence. St. Mark's Basilica was modeled on the now- lost Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, and P√©rigueux Cathedral in Aquitaine (c. 1120) likewise has five domes on pendentives in a Greek cross arrangement. Other examples include the domed naves of Angoul√™me Cathedral (1105‚Äì28), Cahors Cathedral (c. 1100‚Äì1119), and the (c. 1130). = Orthodox Europe = Byzantium's neighboring Orthodox powers emerged as architectural centers in their own right during the Late Byzantine Period. The Bulgarian churches of Nesebar are similar to those in Constantinople at this time. The style and vaulting in the Nesebar cross-in-square churches of Christ Pantocrator and St John Aliturgetos, for example, are similar to examples in Constantinople. Following the construction of Graƒçanica monastery, the architecture of Serbia used the \\"so-called Athonite plan\\", for example at Ravanica (1375‚Äì7). In Romania, Wallachia was influenced by Serbian architecture and Moldavia was more original, such as in the Vorone»õ Monastery with its small dome. Moscow emerged as the most important center of architecture following the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Cathedral of the Assumption (1475‚Äì79), built in the Kremlin to house the icon of Our Lady of Vladimir, was designed in a traditional Russian style by an Italian architect. = Italian Renaissance = Italian Renaissance architecture combined Roman and Romanesque practices with Byzantine structures and decorative elements, such as domes with pendentives over square bays. The Cassinese Congregation used windowed domes in the Byzantine style, and often also in a quincunx arrangement, in their churches built between 1490 and 1546, such as the Abbey of Santa Giustina. The technique of using wooden tension rings at several levels within domes and drums to resist deformation, frequently said to be a later invention of Filippo Brunelleschi, was common practice in Byzantine architecture. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice. The dome of the Pantheon, as a symbol of Rome and its monumental past, was particularly celebrated and imitated, although copied only loosely. Studied in detail from the early Renaissance on, it was an explicit point of reference for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica and inspired the construction of domed rotundas with temple-front porches throughout western architecture into the modern era. Examples include Palladio's chapel at Maser (1579‚Äì80), Bernini's church of S. Maria dell'Assunzione (1662-4), the Library Rotunda of the University of Virginia (1817‚Äì26), and the church of St. Mary in Malta (1833‚Äì60). = Ottoman Empire = Ottoman architecture adopted the Byzantine dome form and continued to develop it. One type of mosque was modeled after Justinian's Church of Sergius and Bacchus with a dome over an octagon or hexagon contained within a square, such as the √ú√ß ≈ûerefeli Mosque (1437‚Äì47). The dome and semi-domes of the Hagia Sophia, in particular, were replicated and refined. A \\"universal mosque design\\" based upon this development spread throughout the world. The first Ottoman mosque to use a dome and semi-dome nave vaulting scheme like that of Hagia Sophia was the mosque of Beyazit II. Only two others were modeled similarly: Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha Mosque and the S√ºleymaniye Mosque (1550‚Äì57). Other Ottoman mosques, although superficially similar to Hagia Sophia, have been described as structural criticisms of it. When Mimar Sinan set out to build a dome larger than that of Hagia Sophia with Selimiye Mosque (1569‚Äì74), he used a more stable octagonal supporting structure. The Selimiye Mosque is of the type originating with the Church of Sergius and Bacchus. Three other Imperial mosques in Istanbul built in this \\"Classical Style\\" of Hagia Sophia include four large semi-domes around the central dome, rather than two: ≈ûehzade Camii, Sultan Ahmed I Camii (completed in 1616), and the last to be built: Yeni Cami (1597‚Äì1663). = Modern revival = A Byzantine revival style of architecture occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries. An early example of the revival style in Russia was the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (1839‚Äì84), which was approved by the Tsar to be a model for other churches in the empire. The style's popularity spread through scholarly publications produced after the independence of Greece and the Balkans from the Ottoman Empire. It was used throughout Europe and North America, peaking in popularity between 1890 and 1914. The Greek Orthodox St Sophia's Cathedral (1877‚Äì79) and Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral (begun 1895), both in London, are examples. The throne room of Neuschwanstein Castle (1885‚Äì86) was built by King Ludwig II in Bavaria. In the late 19th century, the Hagia Sophia became a widespread model for Greek Orthodox churches. In southeastern Europe, monumental national cathedrals built in the capital cities of formerly Ottoman areas used Neo-Classical or Neo-Byzantine styles. Sofia's Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and Belgrade's Church of Saint Sava are examples, and used Hagia Sophia as a model due to their large sizes. Synagogues in the United States were built in a variety of styles, as they had been in Europe (and often with a mixture of elements from different styles), but the Byzantine Revival style was the most popular in the 1920s. Domed examples include The Temple of Cleveland (1924), the synagogue of KAM Isaiah Israel (1924) in Chicago, based upon San Vitale in Ravenna and Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, and the synagogue of Congregation Emanu-El (1926) in San Francisco. In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches beginning in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.

There were no fatalities, but 55 people were injured. Accident At approximately 12:19 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, an Amtrak passenger train collided with a truck, which was obstructing the track on a grade crossing in Halifax, North Carolina. The train was the northbound Carolinian, from Charlotte, North Carolina to New York. There were 221 people on the train; 213 passengers and 8 crew members. Fifty-five people were injured in the accident. The locomotive and baggage car left the track when it struck the truck, which was hauling electrical equipment. GE P42DC locomotive #185 was hauling the train. The locomotive was turned on its side by the force of the accident, and one end of the baggage car was pushed into a brush-covered area next to the railroad right of way. The engineer was among those injured. The truck, an oversize load carrying a power distribution center to New Jersey, had a combined weight of 255,000 pounds, equaling . The truck was being escorted by officers of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. The truck driver was having trouble negotiating a turn, and spent eight minutes backing up and moving forward repeatedly in an attempt to complete the turn at the correct angle. As the Amtrak train approached, the driver realized he could not clear the track in time, and exited the vehicle. The truck driver was uninjured. The truck's driver, 43-year-old John Devin Black of Claremont, North Carolina, had a valid commercial drivers license, which allowed him to haul the oversize load. Black had a history of 12 traffic violations prior to the accident, including excessive speed, and driving more than once using a revoked license. At the time of the accident, the train was headed for New York City from Charlotte, North Carolina. = Aftermath = A witness told a 9-1-1 operator that she did not hear a train horn, but that the railroad crossing lights were working at the site of the accident. Shortly after the accident North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) reported that U.S. 301, N.C. 903 and N.C. 125 were closed in all directions for emergency response, clean-up and investigation purposes. 170 of the remaining uninjured passengers were transported by bus to Richmond, Virginia to be placed on another train. The day after the derailment, authorities stated that no charges will be filed against Black in relation to this accident.  Fate of rolling stock  AMTK 185 was repaired and put back into service. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board was dispatched to the accident scene, and are investigating. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) released a statement on March 9, 2015 that the department would assist Amtrak with the investigation of the accident. The FRA stated it was reviewing an on- board event recorder, interviewing the train's crew, the truck driver, and the North Carolina Patrol trooper that was escorting the truck. Investigators are also attempting to discover if proper protocol for oversized loads was being followed before the accident, as protocol calls for troopers who are escorting the vehicles to \\"clear their routes and inform the railroad dispatchers what they're doing\\". Litigation In May 2015, Amtrak and CSX Transportation (who owns the line) filed a civil lawsuit against Turner Transfer Company, also known as Guy M. Turner Incorporated, who operated the oversize load. The railroad companies alleged that the trucking company, and driver John Black, caused the accident by negligently hauling the oversize load across a marked railroad crossing in an unsafe manner. Both railway companies were seeking in excess of US$75,000 each.

History The Greenwoods (August 2016) Joseph Day, a prominent real estate auctioneer, purchased of land in 1906, dubbed \\"Pleasant Days\\". Construction on Day's home was designed by William W. Renwick and built by Rafael Guastavino's Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company. The property remained with Days until his death in 1944, whereupon a majority of the land was purchased by Peter B. Blanchard Jr. and was rechristened The Greenwoods. Blanchard's stewardship of the land saw significant aesthetic and horticultural changes, beginning with the demolition of the Days' Mediterranean-style mansion and the construction of a Colonial-Revival style home. The Blanchard's were also primarily responsible for the growth and diversification of the namesake gardens on the property, planting hundreds of ornamental trees and shrubs. After Peter Blanchard died in 2000 and in accordance with his wishes, Greenwood Gardens was designated a nonprofit organization and is one of 16 gardens nationwide that is supported by The Garden Conservancy. The following years saw the beginnings of a comprehensive renovation of the property; efforts were made to refurbish the forecourt, retaining walls and many of the statues and assorted ornamentation. Notable features Greenwood Gardens is home to several unique architectural and artistic creations. Two of the most prominent works of art on the property are a wrought iron gate featuring a bird, vines and assorted plants created by Samuel Yellin, and a bronze statue of a boy holding two geese created by Emilio Angela. In addition to the main house the property boasts a summerhouse and teahouse constructed in 1920, and several cottages meant to house workers to maintain the grounds. Admission Prospective visitors can gain access to the garden through a one-time admission fee, or by becoming a member of the Gardens.

Personal life  Phong first developed her artistic abilities in Saigon, Vietnam. She applied to the only art school in Saigon after she finished high school, but was rejected twice. Soon thereafter, she decided to get her teaching credentials. She taught junior high and high school students. While doing so, she emphasized the importance of imagination and would sometimes tell her students Western fairytale stories they were prevented from hearing because of the Fall of Saigon. She fled Vietnam in 1981 via boat. She was 22 years old. After three days at sea, Phong ended up in Malaysian and Filipino refugee camps for over a year before she was sponsored to go to Connecticut.Le, Viet. \\"The Art of War: Vietnamese American Visual Artists Dinh Q. Le, Ann Phong and Nguyen Tan Hoang.\\" Amerasia Journal 31.2 (2005): 21-35. Web. She lived in Connecticut for a short period of time until she decided to move to Southern California in 1982. Phong was working as a dental assistant with plans to become a dentist when she got into a car accident that inspired her to instead follow her passion for the arts. She went to Cal Poly Pomona for her undergraduate degree in fine arts and then Cal State Fullerton for her masters of fine arts. Phong was intrigued by the many influential art history figures that she learned about in school but she was determined to have her own unique style. Her early work and thesis focused primarily on her experiences as an immigrant, but Phong has recently begun exploring the theme of environmental issues in her artwork. She has said that part of the thought process behind these works was dispelling her Thalassophobia and revealing the beauty of the violence and calamity of the ocean. She is now a professor who teaches art at Cal Poly Pomona, and was previously the Board President of the VAALA (Vietnamese American Arts and Letters Association) between 2009 and 2018.  Artwork  Phong creates artwork in her own home with acrylic paints and found objects that she finds at relatives houses and her own. Her artwork has sold up to $1,000. Her technique includes utilizing juxtaposition with heavy impasto layers translating to finer, more transparent layers of paint. Though the subject of her artwork has fluctuated throughout the years, Phong has consistently produced artworks with heavy acrylic impasto texture. She has exhibited her work in Houston, Vancouver, Paris, Thailand, Japan and several cities all over California. Many of her most recent environmentalist artworks have found objects embedded into the canvas while the acrylic paint is still wet. Phong has said that she tries to emulate the beauty of nature and humans' relationship to its destruction in her work. She also explores the theme of human beings as a part of nature in her work. Her experiences fleeing Vietnam by boat have prompted her to portray the ocean frequently, as is evidenced by her very visible, wave-like brushstrokes. Phong sees much of herself in the ocean, saying: > \\"The ocean is inside me. So now when I look back to my own painting, I > notice that I have the ocean's personality. What I mean is that when I am > happy, when I'm quiet, everything looks so calm and transparent like the > water. Water can sparkle. It creates happiness for people. But when I am mad > or when I am low, my brushstroke will be very violent or dark.\\"  Feminism  Prior to creating the mixed media works for which she is renowned, Phong painted about Vietnamese life, culture, and what it was like escaping. She often uses boats as a symbol of the female body as well as the embodiment of the struggle of Vietnamese immigrants escaping the Fall of Saigon. In her artist statement, she writes: \\"In Vietnamese poetry, harbors are metaphors for men and boats are for women. Women are like boats due to their delicacy in shape and elegance in movement on water. ‚ÄúBoat people‚Äù was the label American newspapers and magazines gave the immigrants [over] two decades ago when they escaped Vietnamese communism and fled in small boats.\\" Phong went on to say that unmarried women from her culture are considered to be boats without harbors. Building off of this idea, Phong's early work contains many empty boats without harbors---a symbol of free-spirited women and the perilous journey Vietnamese \\"boat people\\" made to escape Vietnam. These boats are contrasted against violent brushstrokes that are meant to represent the ocean make Phong's early work a colorful storybook of pain and resilience.  Environmentalism  Despite the sea having saved her, during her experience in the ocean, Phong recalls times where she saw toxic sludge of varying colors and debris floating on the surface. She brought attention to the issue with her ‚ÄúFishes in the Water‚Äù (2018) where viewers can see a single fish swimming amongst waste. In later works like ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs Precious, Today‚Äôs Trash‚Äù (from 2014 and 2018), she used pieces of trash that belonged to technology stating: \\"We chase after technology too much.

Old Bering Sea is considered, following Henry B. Collins, the initial phase of the Northern Maritime tradition. Despite its name, several OBS sites lie on the Chukchi Sea. The temporal range of the culture is from 400 BCE to possibly as late as AD 1300. Another suggested range is from about 200 BCE to 500 AD. Discovery The culture was initially named the \\"Bering Sea\\" culture by Canadian archaeologist Diamond Jenness in 1928 following the discovery on the Diomede Islands of distinctively decorated objects such as whaling and sealing harpoon heads. The adjective \\"Old\\" was added by Smithsonian archaeologist Henry B. Collins to distinguish the culture from younger materials with similar design elements. Subsequent discoveries from 1925 to 1940 occurred within archaeological excavations mostly on St. Lawrence Island, and is renowned for its richly carved winged objects, employed as counterweights on atlatls (throwing boards). The artifacts The richly decorated objects are nearly exclusively on walrus tusk, some with distinctive color and antiquity; the decorations were applied to a very wide range of objects, many of which are recovered only in graves, some of which contain dozens of objects. Old Bering Sea pieces are prized by art collectors in New York and Paris and the commoditization of the objects has fueled considerable looting of archaeological sites and spawned a quasi-legal trade (at least in the United States) termed subsistence digging.

OBS is known from Cape Navarin to Kolchinaya Guba. OBS sites are common on all the coasts of St. Lawrence Island, and the Diomedes; however, only isolated finds are known from the mainland of North America, at Barrow, Point Hope, Cape Espenberg and Golovnin Bay, within eastern Norton Sound. Phases of development Several phases of the linear and circle and dot Old Bering Sea style was formally defined by Henry Collins in 1937 on the basis of his extensive excavations at the mound sites of Mayughaaq in the vicinity of Gambell, Alaska, at the northwestern cape of St. Lawrence Island. Collins' research focused on large midden and domestic architecture with few graves located; a large cemetery was subsequently located nearby by Hans Georg Bandi in the 1960s. An important subdivisions of Old Bering Sea is its earliest, more spare designs termed Okvik, for several mounds on an island off the east coast of St. Lawrence Island, excavated by Otto Geist. A small Okvik site, the Hillside locality, lies above the Mayughaaq mound and contains five stone slab houses reasonably well dated to AD 200 to 400. Excavation sites The sites containing Old Bering Sea objects are typically large mounds and middens or cemeteries with hundreds of graves, often framed by bowhead whale mandibles and floored with wooden planks, hewn out of driftwood. Very few graves contain elaborate grave offerings; sufficiently few for some archaeologists to infer the existence of hierarchical groups, including powerful whaling captains and/or shamans, some of whom were women. Origins The origins of Old Bering Sea remains poorly known, although its chronology can be tentatively established from several localities across Bering Strait. The earliest materials termed OBS are dated before 400 BCE from mortuary remains at Ekven. The peak of the culture was between AD 200 and 600, although no firm chronology is yet well-accepted by researchers. The OBS culture is believed to have developed into the Punuk culture in Siberia and to the Birnirk culture in north Alaska. The Old Bering Sea culture is also considered the earliest indication of the Thule culture.

Biography Webb was born at Taunton on 18 September 1735, was the third son of John Webb of Taunton, by his wife Mary, daughter and coheiress of William Sweet of the same town. He was educated at Abingdon and Bristol; afterwards studied theology under Philip Doddridge and his successor, Caleb Ashworth, at the independent academy at Northampton and Daventry; and finished his training with Thomas Amory at Taunton. He entered the nonconformist ministry, became pastor of the congregation at Honiton, and on 27 September 1758 was inducted assistant to Joseph Burroughs, minister of the general baptist congregation at Paul's Alley, London. On the death of Burroughs, on 23 Nov. 1761, Webb undertook the sole charge. In 1766 he retired from the pastoral office and filled the office of deputy searcher at Gravesend until 1777, when he removed to Poole in Dorset. In 1775 he republished Dr. Johnson's ‚ÄòMarmor Norfolciense,‚Äô a squib against Walpole, which first appeared in 1739. Johnson had not concealed his Jacobite principles in penning it, and Webb, in a satirical preface, cleverly contrasted the views he had then held with those he manifested in the ‚ÄòFalse Alarm‚Äô (1770) and in ‚ÄòTaxation no Tyranny‚Äô (1775). During Webb's residence in Dorset he acquired the favour of the Duke of Leeds, the secretary of state, who employed him on several occasions. In 1786 he was appointed secretary to Sir Isaac Heard, and accompanied him to Hesse-Cassel to invest the landgrave with the order of the Garter. In 1801 he accompanied Francis James Jackson to Paris, acting as his secretary during the negotiation of the treaty of Amiens. He was employed by Jackson during the negotiations as an unofficial intermediary, the French diplomatists having much faith in his integrity from their knowledge of his sympathy with Napoleon's government. The understanding of the British envoys with the royalist and ultra-republican malcontents and conspirators was, however, intolerable to him, and he retired to England before the conclusion of peace. He was an intimate friend of the artist Giles Hussey, and wrote a memoir of him which appeared in the ‚ÄòHistory of Dorset‚Äô by John Hutchins, and in Nichols's ‚ÄòLiterary Anecdotes‚Äô. He also gave a more detailed account of Hussey's methods in ‚ÄòPanharmonicon‚Äô, a description of one of his engravings. Webb became a unitarian while residing at Lufton, near Yeovil, where he settled in 1811. He died at Barrington, near Ilminster in Somerset, on 2 August 1815, without surviving issue. On 31 March 1764 he was married at Wareham in Dorset to Hannah, daughter of William Milner of Poole. Webb's portrait has been engraved from a picture by Lemuel Francis Abbott.

He started work as a machinist, became a journalist, and later became a bookseller, publisher and writer. Early years Maurice Paul Delesalle was born on 29 July 1870 in Issy-les-Moulineaux, Seine. He came from a working-class family. He was trained as a metalworker, and made precision instruments. Delesalle became involved in anarchist activity in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, was arrested before May Day in 1892 and detained in Mazas Prison for eighteen days. In 1895 he built the first movie camera (appareil chronophotographique) following the plans of Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re. Delesalle attended the Second International Congress in London from 26 July to 1 August 1896 as a trade union delegate rather than an anarchist. At the opening of the proceedings he tried to speak at the podium but was thrown down to the floor and injured. He contributed to the journal La R√©volte and then worked for Les Temps nouveaux, where in 1897 he became the assistant of Jean Grave. Union activity Delesalle thought that anarchist activity had to start with syndicalism, and became active in the General Confederation of Labour (France) (CGT: Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail). He was assistant secretary of the Federation of Trade Councils (F√©d√©ration des bourses du travail), and assistant secretary of the CGT Trade Councils section from 1897 to 1907. He became one of the most influential anarcho-syndicalists in France during this period. At the Congress of Toulouse in 1897 his motion advocating the use of general strikes, boycotts and sabotage was adopted unanimously. For a period in 1906 and again in 1907 he filled in at the secretariat of the Trade Councils for Georges Yvetot, who was imprisoned. Delesalle was a regular writer in La Voix du peuple, the CGT journal, and edited the Labor section of Les Temps nouveaux until 1906. He left Les Temps nouveaux after writing an antisemitic article. In 1906 he was a member of Libert√© d'opinion (Freedom of opinion), a committee to assist political prisoners. Other activists in the committee included Ren√© de Marmande, Charles Desplanques, Alphonse Merrheim, √âmile Janvion and Auguste Garnery. In 1906 Delesalle was involved in developing the Charter of Amiens. In this manifesto the CGT proclaimed that it was independent of all political movements. Delesalle took the position that the union was a basic part of the worker's life, unlike a political party which people could join or leave at any time as their opinions changed. The workers did not need capitalists or politicians, who served no useful function. Due to a CGT poster after the events in Midi in 1907 he was charged with insulting the army and provoking soldiers to disobedience, but was eventually acquitted. Bookseller At the start of 1908 Delesalle set up as a bookseller and publisher in the rue Monsieur-le-Prince in the Latin quarter. He resigned from the CGT. His shop soon became a meeting place for militants, journalists and writers. He specialized in research of old political documents and works. Delesalle wrote several brochures on the CGT, Labor Exchanges, May Day and so on, and also published literary works. He was carried away with enthusiasm by the Russian Revolution in 1917, and briefly joined the Communist Party. In 1932, suffering from depression, Delesalle sold his bookstore and retired to a small house in Palaiseau, Seine-et-Oise. There he devoted himself for the remainder of his life to studies of social history and of the Paris Commune.

He is considered an important representative of Dutch abstract-minimalist constructivism in sculpture.  Life and work  Visser was born on May 3, 1928 in Papendrecht. From 1948 until 1949 Visser studied architecture at the Technical University in Delft and subsequently from 1949 until 1951 sculpture at the Royal Academy of Arts, The Hague. After study in England and France, he settled as an independent artist in 1952 in Amsterdam. Carel Visser, 1964. In his early career Visser created originally styled iron bird sculptures and had his first solo exhibition in 1954 at Galerie Martinet in Amsterdam. In 1957, when his artistic style became more abstract, a new period began in which he made several trips: a study trip to Italy (Sardinia) on a scholarship from the Italian government in 1957; a stay as a visiting professor at Washington University in St. Louis in 1962; and a study trip to Mexico on a Dutch government scholarship in 1965. Visser was a lecturer at the Royal Academy in The Hague from 1958 to 1962. In 1968 Visser's work was exhibited at Documenta 4 in Kassel, Germany and in the same year he represented the Netherlands in the Venice Biennial, where he was awarded the David E. Bright sculpture prize.http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/carel- visser-2108 In the same year a documentary film about his work was made by Jonne Severijn. In 1981 Visser settled in Rijswijk (Gelderland). From 1966 to 1998 he was Professor at the Ateliers '63 in Haarlem. Visser was recipient of the 1992 Dr A. H. Heineken Prize for Art. In 2004 he received the Wilhelmina- ring for his lifetime achievements. Visser died on March 1, 2015 in Le Fousseret, France, at the age of 86.  Work  Carel Visser is seen as one of the most important constructivist sculptors of the Netherlands. His later work is characterized by the assembly of a variety of materials, such as tires, oil drums, car windows, leather, sheepskin, eggs and so on. He made organized connections, a kind of assemblages, with this so-called great and sometimes small objets trouv√©s (found objects). Some of his work has been compared to a musical composition in which repetition and variation play an important role. Around 1960, Visser was focussed on massive closed cube of iron and \\"slack\\" cube wire. Visser, among other things, was inspired by nature (plants and animals) which also explains his use of natural materials such as wood, wool, sand, feathers, bones, rope and leather. His works from the period 1975-1985 could be called environments, as opposed to the more sculptural work as the dying horse (about 1949).

After graduating from Smith College with a chemistry degree in 1947, she studied Biochemistry at University of California Berkeley with Pardee. Her Ph.D. work, together with the PaJaMo experiment, ruled out ribosomes as carriers of information to synthesize protein, leading to the discovery of messenger RNA. After holding faculty positions at University of California Davis and Stony Brook University, she moved to the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, staying there until age 80. As a senior scientist at MBL she was one of the four founding faculty members of the Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution led by Mitchell Sogin. During this time, she co-founded the EcoCyc database of Escherichia coli metabolism, leading the curation of metabolic pathways and genome information for Escherichia coli for over a decade, and developed classification systems for genes and proteins (including MultiFun), which were forerunners of Gene Ontology.

The domed church architecture of Italy from the sixth to the eighth centuries followed that of the Byzantine provinces and, although this influence diminishes under Charlemagne, it continued on in Venice, Southern Italy, and Sicily. Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel is a notable exception, being influenced by Byzantine models from Ravenna and Constantinople. The Dome of the Rock, an Umayyad Muslim religious shrine built in Jerusalem, was designed similarly to nearby Byzantine martyria and Christian churches. Domes were also built as part of Muslim palaces, throne halls, pavilions, and baths, and blended elements of both Byzantine and Persian architecture, using both pendentives and squinches. The origin of the crossed-arch dome type is debated, but the earliest known example is from the tenth century at the Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba. In Egypt, a \\"keel\\" shaped dome profile was characteristic of Fatimid architecture. The use of squinches became widespread in the Islamic world by the tenth and eleventh centuries. Bulbous domes were used to cover large buildings in Syria after the eleventh century, following an architectural revival there, and the present shape of the Dome of the Rock's dome likely dates from this time. Christian domes in Romanesque church architecture, especially those of the Holy Roman Empire, are generally octagonal on squinches and hidden externally within crossing towers, beginning around 1050. An example is the church of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia, Italy. St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, with its five domes on pendentives modeled on the Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles, was built from 1063 to 1072. Domes on pendentives, apparently based upon Byzantine models, appear in the Aquitaine region of France after the beginning of the Crusades in 1095, such as the abbey church of Fontevrault, where Richard the Lionheart was buried. A series of centrally planned churches were built by the Knights Templar throughout Europe, modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock at their Temple Mount headquarters also an influence. Distinctive domes on pendentives were built in Spain during the Reconquista. Also built there were Christian crossed-arch domes similar to that of the earlier Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba, such as at the in Torres Del R√≠o. Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of rib vaults over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall steeple, but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque. The octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral was a result of the expansion plans for that church from the 14th century, a part of efforts in Tuscany to build domes with exposed external profiles. The muqarnas dome type may have originated in Abbasid Iraq as single brick shells of large squinch-like cells, but it was popular in North Africa and Spain with more intricate cell patterns in stucco on a wooden inner shell. Two outstanding examples from the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, are the 14th century Hall of the Abencerrajes and Hall of the two Sisters. In 14th century Egypt, the Mamluks began building stone domes, rather than brick, for the tombs of sultans and emirs and would construct hundreds of them over the next two and a half centuries. Externally, their supporting structures are distinguished by chamfered or stepped angles and round windows in a triangular arrangement. A variety of shapes for the dome itself were used, including bulbous, ogee, and keel-shaped, and included carved patterns in spirals, zigzags, and floral designs. Bulbous minarets from Egypt spread to Syria in the 15th century and would influence the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of northwest Europe, having become associated with the Holy Land by pilgrims. In the Low Countries of northwest Europe, multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.  Early Middle Ages  Post-Roman areas = The Mausoleum of Theodoric. Although the chronology in uncertain for some examples, domes continued to be built in Italy throughout the Middle Ages. Dome construction appears to have stopped in the city of Rome in the middle of the 5th century, but there are dozens of Italian examples outside of Rome from the next few centuries. Continuing from late antiquity, domes in the early Middle Ages were built over centralized buildings such as baptisteries and martyria. Domed baptisteries built in 6th century Italy include Albenga Baptistery and those of Canosa di Puglia and Nocera Superiore. Other examples of domes may include the Sanctuary of San Prosdocimo in the Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua (6th century), the Basilica of San Leucio at Canosa (6th century), the Basilica of San Salvatore in Spoleto (as early as the end of the 6th century), and the in Benevento (no later than the 7th century). The building projects of Theodoric the Great, the Ostrogothic king of Italy, largely continued existing architectural conventions. His Arian Baptistry in Ravenna (c. 500), for example, closely echoes the Baptistry of Neon built before it. The Mausoleum of Theodoric, however, was understood by contemporaries to be remarkable. Begun in 520, the dome over the mausoleum was carved out of a single 440-ton slab of limestone and positioned some time between 522 and 526. The low saucer shape of the monolithic dome, which is estimated to be more than 230 tons of Istrian stone, may have been chosen to avoid radial cracking. The twelve brackets carved as part of the dome's exterior are thought to have been used to maneuver the piece into place. The choice of large limestone blocks for the structure is significant as the most common construction material in the West at that time was brick. It is likely that foreign artisans were brought to Ravenna to build the structure; possibly from Syria, where such stonework was used in contemporary buildings. The Syria and Palestine area has a long tradition of domical architecture, including wooden domes in shapes described as \\"conoid\\", or similar to pine cones. When the Arab Muslim forces conquered the region, they employed local craftsmen for their buildings and, by the end of the 7th century, the dome had begun to become an architectural symbol of Islam. The rapidity of this adoption was likely aided by the Arab religious traditions, which predate Islam, of both domed structures to cover the burial places of ancestors and the use of a round tabernacle tent with a dome-like top made of red leather for housing idols. Early versions of bulbous domes can be seen in mosaic illustrations in Syria dating to the Umayyad period. They were used to cover large buildings in Syria after the eleventh century. = Umayyad Caliphate = The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the earliest surviving Islamic building, was completed in 691 by Umayyad caliph Abd Al-Malik. Its design was that of a ciborium, or reliquary, such as those common to Byzantine martyria and the major Christian churches of the city. The rotunda of the nearby Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in particular, has a similar design and almost the same dimensions. The building was reportedly burned in the eleventh century and then rebuilt, which would still make it one of the oldest timber buildings in the world. The dome, a double shell design made of wood, is 20.44 meters in diameter. The dome's bulbous shape \\"probably dates from the eleventh century.\\" Several restorations since 1958 to address structural damage have resulted in the extensive replacement of tiles, mosaics, ceilings, and walls such that \\"nearly everything that one sees in this marvelous building was put there in the second half of the twentieth century\\", but without significant change to its original form and structure. It is currently covered in gilded aluminum. In addition to religious shrines, domes were used over the audience and throne halls of Umayyad palaces, and as part of porches, pavilions, fountains, towers and the calderia of baths. Blending the architectural features of both the Byzantine and Persian architecture, the domes used both pendentives and squinches and were made in a variety of shapes and materials. A dome stood at the center of the palace-city of Baghdad and, similarly but on a smaller scale, there are literary accounts of a domed audience hall in the palace of Abu Muslim in Merv at the meeting point of four iwans arranged along the cardinal directions. Muslim palaces included domical halls as early as the eighth century, well before domes became standard elements of mosque architecture. The early eighth century palace of Khirbat al-Minya included a domed gateway. The palace of Qasr Mshatta and a ninth century palace at Samarra included domed throne rooms. A domed structure covered a shallow pool in the main courtyard of the mid eighth century palace of Khirbat al-Mafjar. Similar examples at mosques, such as the domed fountains at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun (destroyed in 987 and replaced with a different structure), at Maarrat al-Numan, in Nishapur, Tripoli, and at the Mosque of Damascus seem to be related to this element of palace architecture, although they were later used as part of ritual ablution. The calderia of early Islamic bath complexes at Amra, Sarraj, and Anjar were roofed with stone or brick domes. The caldarium of the early Islamic bath at Qasr Amra contains \\"the most completely preserved astronomical cupola decoration\\", a decorative idea for bath domes that would long continue in the Islamic world. The placement of a dome in front of the mihrab of a mosque probably began with the rebuilding of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina by Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid. This was likely to emphasize the place of the ruler, although domes would eventually become focal points of decoration and architectural composition or indicate the direction of prayer. Later developments of this feature would include additional domes oriented axially to the mihrab dome. Byzantine workmen built the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus and its hemispherical dome for al Walid in 705. The dome rests upon an octagonal base formed by squinches. The dome, called the \\"Dome of the Eagle\\" or \\"Dome of the Gable\\", was originally made of wood but nothing remains of it. It is supposed to have rested upon large cross beams. Although architecture in the region would decline following the movement of the capital to Iraq under the Abbasids in 750, mosques built after a revival in the late 11th century usually followed the Umayyad model, especially that of the Mosque of Damascus. Domed examples include the mosques at Sarmin (1305-6) and al-Bab (1305). The typical Damascus dome is smooth and supported by a double zone of squinches: four squinches create an eight sided transition that includes eight more squinches, and these create a sixteen-sided drum with windows in alternate sides. = Byzantine influence in Europe = Italian church architecture from the late sixth century to the end of the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans. With the crowning of Charlemagne as a new Roman Emperor, these influences were largely replaced in a revival of earlier Western building traditions. Occasional exceptions include examples of early quincunx churches at Milan and near Cassino. In Italy, there seems to have been a decline in the frequency of dome building between the 8th and 10th centuries. The Palatine Chapel in Aachen. Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel has a domed octagon design influenced by Byzantine models such as the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, the Church of Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople, and perhaps the Chrysotriklinos, or \\"golden reception hall\\", of the Great Palace of Constantinople. It was built at his palace at Aachen between 789 and its consecration in 805. The architect is thought to be Odo of Metz, although the quality of the ashlar construction has led to speculation about the work of outside masons. The octagonal domical vault measures 16.5 meters wide and 38 meters high. It was the largest dome north of the Alps at that time. The dimensions of the octagonal space match that of the 4th century octagonal Chapel of Saint Aquilino at the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan. The later central-plan cemetery church of St. Michael at Fulda was similar to the Aachen chapel, although simpler. Copies of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen include an , , and the Westbau of Essen Minster. The chapel inspired copies into the 14th century and remained a \\"focal-point of German kingship\\". The dome was rebuilt after a fire in 1656 and the interior decoration dates to around 1900. Venice, Southern Italy and Sicily served as outposts of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy. Venice's close mercantile links to the Byzantine empire resulted in the architecture of that city and its vicinity being a blend of Byzantine and northern Italian influences, although nothing from the ninth and tenth centuries has survived except the foundations of the first St. Mark's Basilica. This building was presumably similar to Justinian's Church of the Holy Apostles based on its layout, but how it was roofed is unknown. In southern Italy, examples include the so-called baptistery of Santa Severina in Calabria, built sometime between the 4th and 11th centuries, the church of in Agro di Oria, built sometime between 668 and the 9th century, the 8th or 10th century , the 10th century , and the 10th century . That southern Italy was reconquered and ruled by a Byzantine governor from about 970 to 1071 explains the relatively large number of small and rustic Middle Byzantine-style churches found there, including the Cattolica in Stilo and S. Marco in Rossano. Both are cross-in-square churches with five small domes on drums in a quincunx pattern and date either to the period of Byzantine rule or after. The church architecture of Sicily has fewer examples from the Byzantine period, having been conquered by Muslims in 827, but quincunx churches exist with single domes on tall central drums and either Byzantine pendentives or Islamic squinches. Very little architecture from the Islamic period survives on the island, either. = Al-Andalus and North Africa = Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba. Much of the Muslim architecture of Al-Andalus was lost as mosques were replaced by churches after the twelfth century, but the use of domes in surviving Mozarabic churches from the tenth century, such as the paneled dome at Santo Tom√°s de las Ollas and the lobed domes at the Monastery of San Miguel de Escalada, likely reflects their use in contemporary mosque architecture. The Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba, begun in 785 under the last of the Umayyad caliphs, was enlarged by Al-Hakam II between 961 and 976 to include four domes and a remodeled mihrab. The central dome, in front of the mihrab area, transitions from a square bay with decorative squinches to eight overlapping and intersecting arches that surround and support a scalloped dome. These crossed-arch domes are the first known examples of the type and, although their possible origins in Persia or elsewhere in the east remains a matter of debate, their complexity suggests that earlier examples must have existed. The nine bays of the Mosque of Cristo de la Luz, built about 50 years later, contain a virtual catalog of crossed-arch dome variations. After the 10th century, examples can also be found in Armenia and Persia. The dome of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (also called the Mosque of Uqba), built in the first half of the 9th century, has ribbed domes at each end of its central nave. The dome in front of the mihrab rests on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides. After the ninth century, mosques in North Africa often have a small decorative dome over the mihrab. Additional domes are sometimes used at the corners of the mihrab wall and at the entrance bay. The square tower minarets of two or more stories are capped by small domes. Examples include the Great Mosque of Sfax in Tunisia (founded in the 9th century and later enlarged), the Djamaa el Kebir mosque (probably of the 11th century), and the Great Mosque of Tlemcen (1303). In Cairo, the martyrium of the Sharif Tabataba (943), an 18-meter square nine-domed open pavilion, is the earliest mausoleum whose plan has survived. The most common type, however, was a small domed cube. The Fatimids conquered Egypt from North Africa in 969 and established a new architectural style for their new Caliphate. The earliest Fatimid mosque, Al- Azhar, was similar to the earlier Mosque of Ibn Tulun but introduced domed bays at both ends of the qibla wall, in addition to the dome in front of the mihrab, and this feature was later repeated among the mosques of North Africa. Later alterations to the mosque have changed its original form. The use of corner squinches to support domes was widespread in Islamic architecture by the 10th and 11th centuries. Egypt, along with north-eastern Iran, was one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic mausoleums, beginning in the 10th century. Fatimid mausoleums, many of which have survived in Aswan and Cairo, were mostly simple square buildings covered by a dome. Domes were smooth or ribbed and had a characteristic Fatimid \\"keel\\" shape profile. The first were built in and around Fustat. Those inside the city were decorated with carved stucco and contrast with the extreme simplicity of those outside the city, such as the four so-called Sab'a Banat (c. 1010) domed squares. Those at Aswan, mostly from the 11th century, are more developed, with ribbed domes, star-shaped openings, and octagonal drums with concave exterior sides which are corbeled outward at the top. They vary in plan as well, with domes sometimes joined with barrel vaults or with other domed mausoleums of different dimensions. The Fatimid mausoleum at Qus is in this Aswan style. Other than the small brick domes used over the bay in front of a mihrab or over tombs, Fatimid domes were rare. An exception in size was the large dome over the Fatimid palace dynastic tomb. Literary sources describe royal domes as part of ceremonial processions and royal recreation. Examples of Fatimid palace architecture, however, described by travelers' accounts as their greatest achievement, have not survived. The ribbed or fluted domes introduced by the Fatimids may derive from a theme in earlier Coptic art, and would be continued in the later architecture of the Mamluks. The palace at the Kalaa of the Beni Hammad contained a domed chamber.  High Middle Ages  Hispanic Marches = The so-called first Romanesque style of churches in the early 11th century included examples in Spain with domes on squinches. The domes tend to be dark and sometimes included small windows at the base. The church of Church of Sant Vicen√ß in Cardena was built by 1040 and there is another example at Corbera. The Corbera church may not have been intended to have a dome when the foundations were laid and the crossing bay was narrowed to create a square by the insertion of additional arches on the north and south sides. The dome was covered by a square belfry on the exterior. = East‚ÄìWest Schism = The schism between the churches of Constantinople and Rome was reflected in architecture. The Greek cross and domes of Byzantine architecture were found in areas of Byzantine cultural influence. The domed church of San Giovanni a Mare in Gaeta may have been built in the second half of the 11th century. The earliest existing large French dome is believed to be the pendentive dome built by 1075 over the crossing of the . It reportedly incorporates \\"pottery\\" in its structure, a technique used in the late Roman period. Octagonal cloister vaults appear \\"in connection with basilicas almost throughout Europe\\" between 1050 and 1100. The precise form differs from region to region. They were popular in medieval Italy, in brick. In Italy, the frequency, quality, and scope of dome construction increased beginning in the 11th century (although not in the city of Rome) and they were used in baptisteries, princely chapels, cathedrals, bell towers, and pieve churches. Domes in Romanesque architecture were generally found within crossing towers at the intersection of a church's nave and transept, which concealed the domes externally. Called a tiburio, this tower-like structure often had a blind arcade near the roof. Romanesque domes were typically octagonal in plan and used corner squinches to translate a square bay into a suitable octagonal base. They were built across southern Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries and hundreds of examples under church crossing towers exist in Spain and southern France.  Republic of Venice  St. Mark's Basilica in Venice The Veneto region was strongly influenced by the architecture of Constantinople in the 11th century. On the island of Torcello, the Greek cross octagon style was used in the plan of the . In Venice, the second and current St. Mark's Basilica was built on the site of the first between 1063 and 1072, replacing the earlier church while replicating its Greek cross plan. Five domes vault the interior (one each over the four arms of the cross and one in the center). These domes were built in the Byzantine style, in imitation of the now lost Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Mounted over pendentives, each dome has a ring of windows at its base. These five windowed domes reflect the addition of windows (within tall drums) in the remodeled Byzantine original. However, the tall outer shells at St. Mark's were not added until after 1204. The later high wooden outer domes with lead roofing and cupolas were added to St. Mark's Basilica between 1210 and 1270, allowing the church to be seen from a great distance. In addition to allowing for a more imposing exterior, building two distinct shells in a dome improved weather protection. It was a rare practice before the 11th century. The fluted and onion-shaped cupolas of the domes may have been added in the mid-fifteenth century to complement the ogee arches added to the facade in the late Gothic period. Their shape may have been influenced by the open and domed wooden pavilions of Persia or by other eastern models. Initially, only the center dome had one.  Holy Roman Empire  The architecture of the areas of northern Italy that were a part of the Holy Roman Empire developed differently from the rest of the Italian peninsula. The earliest use of the octagonal cloister vault within an external housing at the crossing of a cruciform church may be at Acqui Cathedral in Acqui Terme, Italy, which was completed in 1067. This became increasingly popular as a Romanesque feature over the course of the next fifty years. The first Lombard church to have a lantern tower, concealing an octagonal cloister vault, was San Nazaro in Milan, just after 1075. Many other churches followed suit in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, such as the Basilica of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia (the coronation church of the Kingdom of Italy within the Holy Roman Empire) and the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. At Sant'Ambrogio, the original plan for the church did not include a domed crossing and it was modified to include one, as also happened at Pisa Cathedral (funding for which was provided by Emperor Henry IV in 1089 and Emperor Henry V in 1116) and Speyer Cathedral (the burial church of the Salian dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors). The crossing domes at Pavia, Pisa, and Speyer were all completed around 1080 but the exact order of precedence is unresolved. The domes of Pisa Cathedral and Florence Baptistery may be the two earliest domes in Tuscany and were the two largest until about 1150. Pisa Cathedral, built between 1063 and 1118, includes a high elliptical dome at the crossing of its nave and transept. The marble dome was one of the first in Romanesque architecture and is considered the masterpiece of Romanesque domes. Rising 48 meters above a rectangular bay, the shape of the dome was unique at the time. The rectangular bay's dimensions are 18 meters by 13.5 meters. Squinches were used at the corners to create an elongated octagon in a system similar to that of the contemporary Basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan and corbelling was used to create an oval base for the dome. The tambour on which the dome rests dates to between 1090 and 1100, and it is likely that the dome itself was built at that time. There is evidence that the builders did not originally plan for the dome and decided on the novel shape to accommodate the rectangular crossing bay, which would have made an octagonal cloister vault very difficult. Additionally, the dome may have originally been covered by an octagonal lantern tower that was removed in the 1300s, exposing the dome, to reduce weight on foundations not designed to support it. This would have been done no later than 1383, when the Gothic loggetta on the exterior of the dome was added, along with the buttressing arches on which it rests. Florence Baptistery in Italy. An aspiring competitor to Pisa, the city of Florence took the opposite side in the conflict between Pope and Emperor, siding with the Pope in Rome. This was reflected architecturally in the \\"proto-renaissance\\" style of its buildings. The eight- sided Florence Baptistery, with its large octagonal cloister vault beneath a pyramidal roof, was likely built between 1059 and 1128, with the dome and attic built between 1090 and 1128. The lantern above the dome is dated to 1150. It takes inspiration from the Pantheon in Rome for its oculus and much of its interior decoration, although the pointed dome is structurally similar to Lombard domes, such as that of the later Cremona Baptistery. Its ratio of wall thickness to external diameter is about 1/10, in accordance with the rules of dome proportion followed until the 17th century. One of the most important religious buildings in Florence, the proportions of its dome were followed by the nearby dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore that was built by Brunelleschi centuries later. The polygonal dome was built with a wooden tension ring at about 23 meters high, too high to counteract the spreading forces, and a lower iron ring was added in 1514. Speyer Cathedral in Germany. The renovation of Speyer Cathedral, the largest of the Imperial Cathedrals of the Holy Roman Empire, was begun around 1080 by the Emperor Henry IV, soon after he had returned from a trip to Canossa in northern Italy. Although the church had only just been consecrated in 1061, Henry called upon craftsmen from across the empire for its renovation. The redesign included two octagonal cloister vaults within crossing towers, one at the east crossing with an external dwarf gallery and one at the west end. This was very soon imitated elsewhere and became the model for later Rhenish octagonal domes, such as those of Worms Cathedral (c. 1120-1181) and Mainz Cathedral (c. 1081-1239). Many German Imperial cathedrals feature domes at their crossings. Churches in northern Italy after 1100 were designed with vaulting from the outset, rather than as colonnaded basilicas with timber roofs and, like the Rhenish imperial cathedrals, many have octagonal domes with squinches over their crossings or choirs. Examples include Parma Cathedral, rebuilt around 1130, and Piacenza Cathedral (1122-1235). Another example is the domed church of San Fedele in Como (11th to 12th century), similar to the church of St. Maria im Kapitol. The Baptistery of Parma, one of the largest baptisteries, was begun in 1196 and has dome frescoes dating from 1260 onwards. The Old Cathedral of Brescia was likely built in the first quarter of the 12th century and has a dome over a meter thick, made of heavy stone at the bottom and lighter porous stone at the top. In Tarquinia, the oval stone dome on squinches over the church of San Giacomo (c. 1121-1140) may have been inspired by the dome of Pisa Cathedral. A dome on pendentives in Tarquinia was completed around 1190 as part of the cathedral of Sta. Maria di Castello and was similar to others in Tuscany and the Veneto. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1819. The dome of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan, a tetraconch building with a central space 23.8 meters square, was rebuilt in the Romanesque style after a fire in 1124. Much admired in the Renaissance, its dome collapsed in 1573 and was rebuilt with the present cloister vault. Documentary evidence indicates that the Romanesque dome of San Lorenzo was a thin hemisphere of light material over a cube of space about 23.8 meters (40 Milanese braccia) on each side. The dome was supported by four corner squinches resting on the four exedrae arches of the square space with a further eight smaller squinches between each of them to create a sixteen-sided base. It was covered on the exterior by a cylindrical or polygonal drum and timber roof. The exterior drum was likely polygonal, with eight or sixteen sides, and had two levels of dwarf galleries beneath a cornice row of hanging arches. Evidence remains in the building's eastern corner towers of flying buttresses extending diagonally to the drum. The existence of a small lantern at the top of the dome is uncertain and the date the dome was completed is unknown. The cathedral of Sovana (1153-1175) and the church of San Salvatore at Terni (about 1200) were constructed with local materials and have precedents in the region. The alternating stone and brick rings of the dome over the at the Abbey of San Galgano are unusual but may be part of Tuscan decorative polychrome banding. It was built in the 1180s as a commemorative chapel with a hemispherical dome over a cylindrical rotunda and the top 16 rings are all in brick, giving the impression of an oculus at the top of the dome.  Duchy of Apulia and Calabria  In southern Italy, the in Canosa di Puglia was built around 1080 with five domes over its \\"T-shaped layout\\", with three domes across the transept and another two out over the nave. Its cruciform plan, use of domes, and the later addition of an external mausoleum suggest that it may have been a Norman analog to the Byzantine Church of the Holy Apostles. It appears to have inspired a series of churches in Apulia with domed naves. The date of construction has been challenged as being decades too late. The multi-domed churches of Cyprus have been proposed as the inspiration for the basilica's domes and for the three-domed naves of later churches in the region, which date mostly from the period of Norman rule, but this is also a topic of debate. , the , , and the were built in the 11th to 13th centuries with pendentive domes. San Corrado also incorporates \\"squinch-like niches\\" between the pendentives and drums of two of its three domes. The domes at Valenzano were covered by low pyramids that were rebuilt in the 1960s. The Cathedral of San Corrado was built around the year 1200. The town of has the ruin of a small domed church that reflects a mixture of eastern and western influences. = Crusades and Reconquista = Bohemond. The Crusades, beginning in 1095, also appear to have influenced domed architecture in Western Europe, particularly in the areas around the Mediterranean Sea. The Mausoleum of Bohemond (c. 1111-18), a Norman leader of the First Crusade, was built next to the Basilica of San Sabino in the southern Italian province of Apulia and has a hemispherical dome in a Byzantine style over a square building with a Greek cross plan. The dome had been covered by a pyramidal roof, according to a 1780s engraving, and the portion above the octagonal drum is a restoration. The Padua Baptistery is believed to have been built contemporaneously with the 1120s reconstruction of Padua Cathedral, a revision of the traditional foundation date of 1260. It has a dome on pendentives spanning an 11.6 meter square space, with a small altar chapel through the eastern wall. It served as a model for the later Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo.  Influence of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre  The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem seems to have had a wooden dome in two shells up to the 12th century, with some interruptions. After their establishing control of the city, the crusaders added a choir with a dome next to the existing rotunda. The French Romanesque addition replaced the eastern apse of the rotunda and a courtyard marking the center of the world and was consecrated on July 15, 1149, the fiftieth anniversary of the capture of the city. The new dome's diameter of 10.4 meters was half that of the rotunda and it rested on four pointed arches on four pillars. It served as the coronation site for the crusader kings of Jerusalem. The rotunda itself was covered by a conical structure from the 12th to the early 19th century. Pisa Baptistry was built in 1153 with a truncated cone in clear imitation of the Holy Sepulchre; an outer dome shell was added in the 14th century. The domed baptisteries of Cremona (1176) and Parma (1196) also appear to have been influenced by the rotunda. The 12th century rotunda of the Holy Sepulchre at Santo Stefano, Bologna, and the basilica at Neuvy-Saint-S√©pulchre are imitations of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre although, like many of the imitations across Europe, they differ in their details, including their domes. Most of these \\"so-called 'copies'\\" have a dome or domical vault. An example is a church at Almenno, Italy, which has a stone dome resting on eight supporting columns. The Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount of Jerusalem were taken by the crusaders to represent the Temple of Solomon and the Palace of Solomon, respectively. The Knights Templar, headquartered at the site, built a series of centrally planned churches throughout Europe modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock also an influence. Examples include the church of the , the church of the Convento do Cristo at Tomar, a rotunda church in Paris destroyed during the French Revolution, and Temple Church in London. The Church of Saint Mary of Eunate was a pilgrims' burial church, rather than a Templar church, but may have been influenced by them.  Aquitaine and the Angevin Empire  The nave of Angoul√™me Cathedral. In the Aquitaine region of southwest France, there are a large number of unusual domed Romanesque churches; over 250 in the P√©rigord region alone. The area is far from ports with regular contact with the East and the source of influence is not entirely settled. A study in 1976 of Romanesque churches in the south of France documented 130 with oval plan domes, such as the domes on pendentives at and Balzac, Charente. The oval shape appears to have been a practical solution to rectangular crossing bays. The use of pendentives to support domes in the Aquitaine region, rather than the squinches more typical of western medieval architecture, strongly implies a Byzantine influence. Between the Garonne and Loire rivers there are known to have been at least seventy-seven churches whose naves were covered by a line of domes. Half of them are in the P√©rigord region. Most date to the twelfth century and sixty of them survive today. That the domes in this area were arranged in linear series has suggested the contemporary architecture of Cyprus as the inspiration, which was located on a pilgrimage route to the Holy Land. Cyprus had developed its own style of domed basilica during its period of neutrality between Byzantine and Arab rulers, using three domes of roughly equal size in a line over the nave and very little lighting. There are indications of a connection between Aquitaine and Cyprus just after the First Crusade. The earliest of these French churches may be Angoul√™me Cathedral, built from 1105 to 1128. Its long nave is covered by four stone domes on pendentives, springing from pointed arches, the last of which covers the crossing and is surmounted by a stone lantern. The domes of the church of preceded the larger ones at Cahors Cathedral. Cahors Cathedral (c. 1100‚Äì1119) covers its nave with two large domes in the same manner and influenced the later . The domes at Cahors have a diameter of more than fifty feet. The abbey church at Fontevrault served as a burial place for Plantagenet royalty, including Richard the Lionheart, and is one of the most impressive examples. The earlier domed crossing is preceded by a wider nave covered by four domes, which was begun in 1125. The pendentives are original, but the four nave domes are modern replacements from about 1910. Originally designed as a three-aisled hall church with barrel vaults, after the choir was completed the nave was redesigned with piers to support the line of domes spanning the full width. Likewise at the Abbaye aux Dames in Saintes, the abbey church was remodeled during construction to allow for the domes. The cathedral of S. Front at P√©rigueux was built c. 1125‚Äì1150 and derives its five-domed cruciform plan ultimately from the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. The S. Front domes had dressed stone only on the lowest levels prior to alterations by Paul Abadie in the 19th century. The lanterns on the domes at Souillac were likewise added by 19th century restoration. The 11th and 12th century Cathedral of Le Puy uses an unusual row of six octagonal domes on squinches over its nave, with the domes at the western end being at least a century later than those at the east end. A seventh dome is located in the normal position for a Romanesque dome on squinches: over the crossing. Other examples of this use over naves are rare and scattered. One is the large church of Saint Hilaire at Poitiers, which seems to have been influenced by Le Puy Cathedral. In 1130, its wide nave was narrowed with additional piers to form suitable square bays, which were vaulted with octagonal domes whose corner sides over trumpet squinches were so narrow that the domes resemble square cloister vaults with beveled corners. In Auvergne, there are several Romanesque churches with domed crossings that use squinches, with the dome supported by \\"flying screen\\" walls at the crossing bay and hidden on the exterior beneath octagonal towers with buttressing \\"shoulders\\" on two sides. Examples include the and the , which has a rotunda over the domed crossing. The crossing dome at Obazine Abbey has pendentives, which became popular in France throughout the 12th century. By the middle of the 12th century, the use of drums with windows beneath the domes allowed in more light. Octagonal drums were preferred. Examples include the in the Limousin region and the . Gothic rib vaulting superseded the use of domes in south-west France after the 12th century. The church at Saint-Avit-S√©nieur appears to have been designed for domes but they may never have been built. The nave is covered instead by ribbed Angevin style vaults. The \\"domical shape of Angevin vaults\\", like those seen in Angers Cathedral, may be due to the influence of Romanesque domed churches.  Kingdom of Le√≥n and the Emperors of all Spain  Cathedral of Salamanca. Intersection of the dome arches inside the Atalaya Castle (Spain) of Villena. The remains of a crossing tower on the French Church of Saint-Jean de Montierneuf from about 1140 suggest an origin for some Spanish domes in a Romanesque and transitional Gothic style. The architectural influences at work here have been much debated, with proposed origins ranging from Jerusalem, Islamic Spain, or the Limousin region in western France to a mixture of sources. During the Reconquista, the Kingdom of Le√≥n in northern Spain built three churches famous for their domed crossing towers, called \\"cimborios\\", as it acquired new territories. The Cathedral of Zamora, the Cathedral of Salamanca, and the collegiate church of Toro were built around the middle of the 12th century. All three buildings have stone umbrella domes with sixteen ribs over windowed drums of either one or two stories, springing from pendentives. All three also have four small round towers engaged externally to the drums of the domes on their diagonal sides. Perhaps the masterpiece of the series, the Salamanca crossing tower has two stories of windows in its drum. Its outer stone fish-scale roof lined with gothic crockets is a separate corbelled layer with only eight lobes, which applies weight to the haunches of the sixteen-sided inner dome. A later related dome is that over the chapter house of the Old Cathedral of Plasencia. The dome of the in Segovia is an octagonal crossed-arch dome on squinches that may have been made with concrete around the middle of the 12th century. Another unusual Spanish example from the late 12th or early 13th century is the dome of the in Torres Del R√≠o, on the Way of St. James. The Way, a major pilgrimage route through northern Spain to the reputed burial place of St. James the Greater, attracted pilgrims from throughout Europe, especially after pilgrimage to Jerusalem was cut off. The difficulty of travel to Jerusalem for pilgrimage prompted some new churches to be built as a form of substitute, evoking the central plan and dome of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre with their own variant. The dome in this case, however, is most evocative of the central mihrab dome of the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Over an octagonal room, the stone dome is formed by sixteen ribs, eight of which intersect with one another in a star pattern to define a smaller octagon at the center of the dome. This is one of a number of Christian crossed-arch dome examples in Spain and the south of France from the end of the 12th century, with patterns based upon the square or octagon. Other examples include the domes of San Miguel de Almaz√°n, , and . Contemporary Islamic examples in Spain and North Africa are distinguished from the Christian by the use of thinner and more numerous arches, such as those of the Alc√°zar of Seville, the Villena Castle in Alicante, the Great Mosque of Taza, and the minaret of Koutoubia Mosque. The style experienced a revival in early 16th century Spain when one of the crossed-arch domes of the Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba was used as the model for domes at Zaragoza, Teruel, and Tarazona. = Kingdom of Sicily = The Christian domed basilicas built in Sicily after the Norman Conquest also incorporate distinctly Islamic architectural elements. They include hemispherical domes positioned directly in front of apses, similar to the common positioning in mosques of domes directly in front of mihrabs, and the domes use four squinches for support, as do the domes of Islamic North Africa and Egypt. In other cases, domes exhibit Byzantine influences with tall drums, engaged columns, and blind arcades. Examples at Palermo include the Palatine Chapel (1132‚Äì1143), La Martorana (c. 1140s), and Zisa, Palermo (12th century). The church of San Giovanni degli Eremiti has five domes in a T-shaped arrangement and the Church of San Cataldo has three domes on squinches, with both showing clearly Islamic influence. The church of Santi Pietro e Paolo d'Agr√≤ in Casalvecchio Siculo, Sicily, has two domes from around 1130, with a circular-base dome over the nave and an octagonal-base dome over the altar. = North Africa, Syria, and Al-Jazira = mausoleum of Nur al-Din in Damascus. The so-called shrine of Imam al-Dawr in the village of al-Dawr, Iraq, is the earliest known example of a muqarnas dome, although it is unlikely to have been the first of its type. The dome rests on an octagonal base created by four squinches over a square bay. Three levels of muqarnas rise over this and are capped by a small cupola. The muqarnas cells are very large and resemble small squinches themselves. It was finished by 1090 by the court of an Uqaylid vassal of the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad and, although there are no surviving examples from Baghdad at this time, the large number of muqarnas domes known to have existed there by the end of the Middle Ages suggests that it could have been the source of the type. In Islamic North Africa, there are several early muqarnas domes dating from the twelfth century. The earliest may be an Almoravid restoration between 1135 and 1140 of a series of stucco muqarnas domes over the axial nave of the mosque of the Qarawiyyin in Fez. The existence of a near contemporary example from 1154 in the maristan of Nur al-din in Damascus, Syria, and the earlier example of a muqarnas dome in al-Dawr, Iraq, suggests that the style was imported from Baghdad. Most of the examples of muqarnas domes are found in Iraq and the Jazira, dated from the middle of the twelfth century to the Mongol invasion. The use of stucco to form the muqarnas pattern, suspended by a wooden framework from the exterior vault, was the least common in Iraq, although it would be very popular in North Africa and Spain. Because it used two shells, however, windows were restricted to the bases of the domes. They were otherwise used frequently in this type. In Iraq, the most common form was a single shell of brick, with the reverse of the interior pattern visible on the exterior. The Damascus mausoleum of Nur al-Din (1172) and the shrine of Zumurrud Khatun in Baghdad are examples. A third type is found only in Mosul from the beginning of the thirteenth century. It has a brick pyramidal roof, usually covered in green glazed tiles. Of the five preserved examples, the finest is the shrine of Awn al-Din, which used tiny colored tiles to cover the muqarnas cells themselves and incorporates small muqarnas domes into the tiers of muqarnas supporting the large eight-sided star at the center. This design led to a further development at the shrine of Shaykh Abd al-Samad in Natanz, Iran. The architecture of Syria and the Jazira includes the widest variety of forms in the medieval Islamic world, being influenced by the surviving architecture of Late Antiquity, contemporary Christian buildings, and Islamic architecture from the east. There are some muqarnas domes of the Iraqi type, but most domes are slightly pointed hemispheres on either muqarnas pendentives or double zones of squinches and made of masonry, rather than brick and plaster. The domes cover single bay structures or are just a part of larger constructions. Syrian mausoleums consist of a square stone chamber with a single entrance and a mihrab and a brick lobed dome with two rows of squinches. The dome at the Silvan Mosque, 13.5 meters wide and built from 1152‚Äì1157, has an unusual design similar to the dome added to the Friday Mosque of Isfahan in 1086-1087: once surrounded by roofless aisles on three sides, it may have been meant to be an independent structure. The congregational mosque at Kƒ±zƒ±ltepe, with its well integrated dome of about 10 meters, is the masterpiece of Artuqid architecture. The largest preserved Ayyubid dome is that of the Matbakh al-'Ajami in Aleppo, resting on muqarnas pendentives. It may have been the palace residence of the al-'Ajami family. The mausoleum over the tomb of Iman Al-Shafi‚Äòi (built in 1211) has a large wooden double dome (rebuilt in 1722) about 29 meters high and, with the tombs of al-Malik al-Silah and the so-called Tomb of the Abassid Caliphs, is one of three important Ayyubid tombs in Cairo dating from the first half of the 13th century. The domed mausoleum was built 35 years after the madrassa ordered by Saladin at the site in 1176‚Äì7, which were introduced in Egypt after 1171 to counter Shia Islam. The only madrassa from the period to partly survive is the 1242 construction by As-Salih Ayyub on the site of the Fatimid Eastern Palace. The 10 meter wide domed tomb at its northern end led to the series of funerary madrassas built in Cairo by the Mamluk Sultans. = Late Romanesque and early Gothic Europe = The use of domes declined in Western Europe with the rise of Gothic architecture. Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of rib vaults over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall steeple, but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque. Spaces of circular or octagonal plan were sometimes covered with vaults of a \\"double chevet\\" style, similar to the chevet apse vaulting in Gothic cathedrals. The crossing of is an example. The 13th century ribbed dome on squinches at the crossing of the in √Åvila, Spain is another. The domed \\"Decagon\\" nave of St. Gereon's Basilica in Cologne, Germany, a ten-sided space in an oval shape, was built between 1219 and 1227 upon the remaining low walls of a 4th-century Roman mausoleum. The ribbed domical vault rises four stories and 34 meters above the floor, covering an oval area 23.5 meters long and 18.7 meters wide. It is unique among the twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne, and in European architecture in general, and may have been the largest dome built in this period in Western Europe until the completion of the dome of Florence Cathedral. The dome of Siena Cathedral. In Italy, the dome of Siena Cathedral had an exposed profile as early as 1224, and this feature was retained in its reconstruction around 1260. The dome has two shells and was completed in 1264. It is set over an irregular hexagon with squinches to form an irregular twelve-sided base. No large dome had ever before been built over a hexagonal crossing. The current lantern dates from the 17th century and the current outer dome is a 19th- century replacement. An octagonal dome for Florence Cathedral may have been part of the original design by Arnolfo di Cambio for the church, construction of which began in 1296. The Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua was built between 1231 and 1300, in the early period of Italian Gothic architecture, and features seven domes with a blend of Gothic and Byzantine elements. Similar to St Mark's Basilica in Venice, its nave, transepts, crossing, and the intermediate bay before the choir are covered by domes on pendentives in the Byzantine style. Externally, the crossing dome is covered with a conical spire. The choir dome, which may be later than the others, is uniquely Gothic with ribs. An eighth dome covers the attached Relics Chapel, adjacent to the choir dome. The masonry domes are covered externally by timber structures and several were repaired following a 1347 lightning strike and a 1748 fire. The two nearest the facade may be in their original condition. In England, a dome with a pyramidal roof and lantern at the Abbot's kitchen of Glastonbury Abbey dates to the early 14th century. Similar vaulting was built over the kitchen of Newenham Abbey by 1338. Timber star vaults such as those over York Minster's octagonal Chapter house (ca. 1286‚Äì1296) and the elongated octagon plan of Wells Cathedral's Lady Chapel (ca. 1320‚Äì1340) imitated much heavier stone vaulting. The wooden vaulting over the crossing of Ely Cathedral was built after the original crossing tower collapsed in 1322. It was conceived by Alan of Walsingham and designed by master carpenter William Hurley. Eight hammer vaults extend from eight piers over the 22 meter wide octagonal crossing and meet at the base of a large octagonal lantern, which is covered by a star vault.  Late Middle Ages  Andalusia = Hall of the Abencerrajes. Star-shaped domes are found at the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, which contains domed audience halls built to mirror the heavenly constellations. The Hall of the Abencerrajes (c. 1333‚Äì91) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333‚Äì54) are extraordinarily developed examples of muqarnas domes, taking the tradition of the squinch in Islamic architecture from a functional element in the zone of transition to a highly ornamental covering for the dome itself. The structural elements of these two domes are actually brick vaulting, but these are completely covered by the intricate moc√°rabe stalactites. The lacy and star-shaped crossing dome of Burgos Cathedral (1567) may have been inspired by these examples, in addition to that built over the cathedral's octagonal Chapel of the Condestable (1482-94) in the Gothic style. In the mud√©jar style of Seville after the Christian reconquest of the city, a kind of dome made of intricately interlaced pieces of painted and gilded wood was known as a media naranja, or \\"half orange\\". The most famous example covers the \\"Hall of the Ambassadors\\" throne room in the Royal Palace Complex of Seville, a 10 meter wide space built in 1427. = Mamluk Sultanate = Qaytbay in Cairo's northern cemetery. In the first half of the fourteenth century, stone blocks replaced bricks as the primary building material in the dome construction of Mamluk Egypt, with the brick domes being only 20 percent of those constructed around 1322. Over the course of 250 years, around 400 domes were built in Cairo to cover the tombs of Mamluk sultans and emirs. Although they kept roughly the same proportions, the shift from brick to stone is also associated with an increase in the average span and height of about 3 to 4 meters, and a decrease in the thickness of the domes. The stone domes are generally 8 to 10 meters in diameter and 7 to 11 meters high. The Mausoleum of Farag Ibn Barquq (1398‚Äì1411) is an exceptional case, with a dome 16 meters wide and 12.8 meters tall. The stone domes are generally single shells except at the conical crown, where there is a gap between inner and outer layers filled with earth and rubble and which contains the bases of the metal spires. Double shelled domes are rare, but an example is that of Al-Sultanyya Madrasa from 1360. The domes were constructed in circular rings, with the sizes decreasing towards the top of the dome and, because of this, it is possible that elaborate centering may not have been needed. Collapsed remains of some domes has revealed a layer of brick beneath the external stone, which could have supported and aligned the heavier stone during construction. Although the earliest stone domes do not have them, horizontal connections between the ashlar stone blocks were introduced in the fourteenth century, such as those made of teak wood in a dovetail shape used in the Mausoleum of Farag Ibn Barquq. Dome profiles were varied, with \\"keel-shaped\\", bulbous, ogee, stilted domes, and others being used. On the drum, angles were chamfered, or sometimes stepped, externally and triple windows used in a tri-lobed arrangement on the faces. Decoration for these first stone domes was initially the same external ribbing as earlier brick domes, and such brick domes would continue to be built throughout the Mamluk period, but more elaborate patterns of carving were introduced through the beginning of the sixteenth century. Early stones domes were plastered externally when not cut precisely enough, but improvements in technique over time would make this unnecessary. Spiral ribs were developed in the 1370s and zigzag patterns were common both by the end of the fourteenth century and again at the end of the fifteenth century. In the fifteenth century, interlaced star and floral designs were used in a tiled pattern. The uniqueness of a pattern on a mausoleum dome helped to associate that dome with the individual buried there. The twin-domes of the Sultaniyya complex (c. 1360) and the narrow dome of Yunus al-Dawadar (c. 1385) are unusual in that they have muqarnas at the base of their external ribs, a feature of ribbed domes in Persia. The first example of the zigzag pattern is on the dome of Mahmud al-Kurdi (1394‚Äì95), and at least fourteen subsequent domes also used it. The first example of a dome in Cairo with a star pattern is the mausoleum of al-Ashraf Barsbay. The dome of Qaytbay in Cairo's northern cemetery combines geometric and arabesque patterns and is one of the finest. Internally, the squinches of the zone of transition developed into miniaturized and pointed versions that were used row upon row over the entire expanded zone and bordered above and below by plain surfaces. Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century. = Kingdom of Italy in the Holy Roman Empire = Tuscany  Pisa Baptistery and Cathedral. Exposed domes were common in Tuscany and a source of regional distinctiveness by the 1380s. The exposed outer dome of Pisa Baptistery was built over its earlier inner conical roof in the 14th century. If an external lantern tower was also removed from Pisa Cathedral in the 1300s, exposing the dome, one reason may have been to stay current with more recent projects in the region, such as the domed cathedrals of Siena and Florence. Rapid progress on a radical expansion of Siena Cathedral, which would have involved replacing the existing dome with a larger one, was halted not long after the city was struck with an outbreak of the Black Death in 1348. Its dome was originally topped with a copper orb, similar to that over Pisa's dome today, but this was replaced in 1385 by a cupola surmounted by a smaller sphere and cross. It was only a few years after the city of Siena had decided to abandon the massive expansion and redesign of their cathedral in 1355 that Florence decided to greatly expand theirs. A plan for the dome of Florence Cathedral was settled by 1357. However, in 1367 it was proposed to alter the church plan at the east end to increase the scale of the octagonal dome, widening it from 62 to 72 braccia, with the intent to further surpass the domes of Pisa and Siena, and this modified plan was ratified in 1368, under Master of Works Francesco Talenti. The construction guilds of Florence had sworn to adhere to the model of the dome created in 1367, with a \\"quinto acuto\\" pointed profile, but the scale of this new dome was so ambitious that experts for the Opera del Duomo, the board supervising the construction, expressed the opinion as early as 1394 that the dome could not be accomplished. Discussion in the fourteenth century revolved primarily around the cost of the project, and secondarily about the style. The enlarged dome would span the entire width of the three aisled nave, just 2 meters less than that of the Roman Pantheon, the largest dome in the world. And because the distances between the angles of the octagon were even farther apart at , the average span of the dome would be marginally wider than that of the Pantheon. At 144 braccia, the height of the dome would evoke the holy number of the Heavenly Jerusalem mentioned in the Book of Revelation. By 1413, with the exception of one of the three apses, the east end of the church had been completed up to the windowed octagonal drum but the problem of building the huge dome did not yet have a solution. In 1417, with the drum completed, the master builder in charge of the project retired and a competition for plans to build the dome was begun in August 1418. Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence. Filippo Brunelleschi proposed avoiding the problem of building an independent wooden scaffolding sufficiently strong to support the dome during construction, which may not have been possible, by using lower levels of the dome itself to support construction of higher levels. To demonstrate the idea, he built a dome without scaffolding over the Ridolfi chapel in the Church of San Jacopo sopr'Arno. Brunelleschi's plan to use suspended scaffolding for the workers won out over alternatives such as building a provisional stone support column in the center of the crossing or filling the space with earth, and he and Lorenzo Ghiberti were made joint leaders of the project to build the dome for Florence Cathedral in 1420. The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433. Brunelleschi's dome, designed in 1418, follows the height and form mandated in 1367. The dome can be described as a cloister vault, with the eight ribs at the angles concentrating weight on the supporting piers. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells. A stairway winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark the edges of the eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend from the base of the dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated iron cramps also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third of the way up the dome, and one two thirds of the way up the dome. Although generally preferred in Italy at the time, no visible internal ties were used. Only four major cracks have been observed on the inner dome, compared to about fourteen each on the domes of the Pantheon and St. Peter's Basilica. The design of the dome is very different from that of the Pantheon and it is unclear what the influences were, but it does share some similarities with earlier and smaller brick domes in Persia. The use of a herringbone pattern in the brick allowed for short horizontal sections of the layers of the dome to be completed as self-supporting units. Over 32 meters in height, it remains the largest masonry dome ever built. The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer. The lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death. It was completed by Michelozzo di Bartolommeo and Bernardo Rossellino in 1467. Brunelleschi had planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of unclad masonry can be seen today. Although a portion of it was constructed on the southeast side beginning in 1508, work stopped after the visual effect was criticized by Michelangelo. At the conclusion of the Council of Florence on June 6, 1439, the ceremony of union between the Catholic and Orthodox churches took place beneath the dome of Florence Cathedral. In the Old Sacristy of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence, the smaller dome above the altar is decorated with astrological depictions of star constellations that have been calculated to represent July 6, 1439 at about noon, the date of the closing session of the Council of Florence, in which the Articles of Union between Eastern and Western Christendom were signed by Latin and Greek delegates.  Early renaissance  Brunelleschi's domes at San Lorenzo and the Pazzi Chapel established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture. His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's Basilica of Santa Croce (1430‚Äì52) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. Twelve ribs between twelve circular windows converge on a small oculus. The circular dome rests on pendentives decorated with circular medallions of Florentine ceramic. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential. The dome of (1499‚Äì1514) is circular and also includes pendentives with circular medallions. Another early example is Giuliano da Sangallo's 1485 design of a dome on the church of Santa Maria delle Carceri in Prato. Like that of the Pazzi Chapel, the dome is ribbed. The domed was built in the late 15th century. The combination of dome, drum, pendentives, and barrel vaults developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century. Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome, then Venice. The quincunx plan became popular in many parts of Italy from the end of the 15th century, often with a large dome on pendentives at the center of a square and four smaller domes at the corners. From the late 15th century, semicircular arches became preferred in Milan, but round domes were less successful due to structural difficulties compared to those with pointed profiles. Domes in the renaissance style in Florence are mostly from the early period, in the fifteenth century. Cities within Florence's zone of influence, such as Genoa, Milan, and Turin, mainly produced examples later, from the sixteenth century on. De re aedificatoria, written by Leon Battista Alberti and dedicated to Pope Nicholas V around 1452, recommends vaults with coffering for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is Bernardo Rossellino. Under Pope Nicholas V, construction started between 1451 and 1455 on an extension of the old St. Peter's Basilica to create a Latin cross plan with a dome and lantern 100 braccia high over a crossing 44 braccia wide (about 24.5 meters wide). Little more than foundations and part of the choir walls were completed before work stopped with the death of Nicholas V. This innovation would culminate in Bramante's 1505‚Äì6 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica, and throughout the sixteenth century the Renaissance set of dome and barrel vault would displace use of Gothic ribbed vaults. The segmental dome of Nicolas V's Church of San Teodoro al Palatino in Rome (begun in 1453) is the first known to be built within the city since the middle of the 5th century. Under Pope Sixtus IV additional domed churches were commissioned, such as Santa Maria del Popolo (1472-1478) with its octagonal cloister vault on pendentives, the domed Augustinian basilica of Sant'Agostino, and Santa Maria della Pace (completed around 1490), also an octagonal cloister vault but over an octagonal foundation. Venetian Renaissance architecture, perhaps delayed due to Venice's political independence, was blended with the existing Venetian architectural tradition of Eastern influence. Pietro Lombardo designed the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli (1481‚Äì89) with a dome over the sacristy. The masonry dome on a shallow drum and pendentives is covered by a taller outer wooden dome with a lantern.  Duchy of Urbino  The was completed in Urbino before 1481 as a domed trilobe mausoleum. Begun in 1469, the Basilica of the Holy House at Loreto has an octagonal dome with a Gothic profile similar to that of Florence Cathedral. It was built by Giuliano da Sangallo from 1499 to 1500, and its structure uses a herringbone pattern and contains two iron chains to resist outward thrust. The four towers at the corners of the crossing also contain octagonal cloister vaults at their intermediate level.  Duchy of Milan  Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. In Lombardy, both octagonal and circular domes used ribs as late as the 1490s. Examples include the Portinari Chapel at the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio, the church of Certosa di Pavia (1396‚Äì1473), the church of Sta. Maria Bressanoro at Castelleone, Milan Cathedral, and the church of Santa Maria della Croce. Leonardo da Vinci, Bramante, and others were involved in Pavia Cathedral, construction of which began in 1488. The Portinari Chapel, Colleoni Chapel, and use a large square block to support a timburio. Donato Bramante's dome of Santa Maria presso San Satiro was the first Lombard \\"ribless hemispherical cupola with coffers\\". The burial church of the House of Sforza, Santa Maria delle Grazie, was begun in 1492 and by 1497 was completed to the upper gallery of the timburio. It is similar to the earlier Church of San Bernardino in Urbino in that it is also a domed trilobe mausoleum. However, the smooth, almost-hemispherical dome without ribs and the sixteen-sided timburio with two galleries and a pitched roof are clearly modeled on the earlier Church of San Lorenzo in Milan, called the \\"Milanese Pantheon\\", and the interior arrangement is similar to that of the Portinari Chapel. = Low Countries of northwest Europe = In the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the Near East exposed the Low Countries of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the Orient. Although the first expressions of their European use are in the backgrounds of paintings, architectural uses followed. The Dome of the Rock and its bulbous dome being so prominent in Jerusalem, such domes apparently became associated by visitors with the city itself. In Bruges, The , designed to symbolize the Holy Sepulchre, was finished with a Gothic church tower capped by a bulbous cupola on a hexagonal shaft in 1428. Sometime between 1466 and 1500, a tower added to the Chapel of the Precious Blood was covered by a bulbous cupola very similar to Syrian minarets. Likewise, in Ghent, an octagonal staircase tower for the Church of St. Martin d'Ackerghem, built in the beginning of the sixteenth century, has a bulbous cupola like a minaret. These cupolas were made of wood covered with copper, as were the examples over turrets and towers in the Netherlands at the end of the fifteenth century, many of which have been lost. The earliest example from the Netherlands that has survived is the bulbous cupola built in 1511 over the town hall of Middelburg. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the following decades.

Born in Geraldton to Alvie Jean (n√©e Fullwood) and Albert James Elliott, Elliott attended state schools in Reedy and Waroona, two small country towns where her father was employed as a machinist. She became a member of the Labor Party in 1955, and was secretary to Joe Chamberlain, the general secretary of the party's WA branch, for almost 20 years. She also undertook work for the party's National Executive and at national conferences, and was also briefly employed by the UK Labour Party. Elliott unsuccessfully stood for the Legislative Assembly seat of Floreat at the 1968 election, gaining only 35.4% of the two-party-preferred vote against the Liberal candidate, Andrew Mensaros. At the 1971 election, she replaced the retiring Ruby Hutchison in the Legislative Council. Elliott was only the second woman elected to the Legislative Council (after Hutchison, who had been influential in securing her preselection), and, until June Craig was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1974, was the only woman in parliament. In parliament, Elliott was a member of several committees, including the Royal Commission that resulted in the passing of the Alcohol and Drug Authority Act 1974. She was chairperson of the parliamentary Labor Party from 1978 to 1986, the first woman in the position, and was particularly active in Labor Party policy committees.Black and Phillips (2000), p. 102. During the Burke Government, she chaired a taskforce on domestic violence, with a number of its recommendations subsequently enshrined in legislation.Black and Phillips (2000), p. 103.

One exception was an amendment to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1920, requested by the RSPCA, which expanded the provisions relating to the abandonment of domestic animals.Black and Phillips (2000), p. 107. Elliott was also a member of People for Nuclear Disarmament, and unsuccessfully opposed the introduction of uranium mining legislation in 1978.Black and Phillips (2000), p. 107‚Äì108. Although very active in parliament's committee system, she was often critical of parliamentary procedure, particularly what she regarded as its unnecessarily long sitting hours.

Although there was support for Elliott's promotion to the ministry following Labor's success at the 1983 state election, no position was forthcoming. Following an electoral redistribution carried out by the Labor government, she was given only a half- term of three years, while Fred McKenzie, the other North-East Metropolitan MLC, was selected for a full six-year term.

However the large projects undertaken with China often served to exacerbate anti-China sentiment in the country, which has always had a contentious relationship with its northern neighbor. Though a substantial ethnic-Chinese population has long been a part of Myanmar‚Äôs demographic landscape, an influx of Chinese immigrants with business connections in Northern Myanmar over the past 20 years has caused tensions and anti-Chinese feelings to riseMarshall, Andrew R.

Like many issues in Myanmar, anti-Chinese feelings have come to the surface and been manipulated since the democratic transition removed censorship and created a new political economy. In September 2011 the Thein Sein government abandoned the Myitsone Dam project in Kachin State. Ninety percent of the electricity produced by the $3.6 billion dam would have gone to China, which, combined with its environmental impact, led to broad protest in Myanmar. More recently, the Director of Myanmar‚Äôs railway ministry, Myint Wai, announced in July 2014 the cancelation of a proposed $20 billion railway link between Myanmar‚Äôs oil-producing Rakhine State and China‚Äôs Yunnan Province citing ‚Äúpublic demand.‚Äù Some, however, speculate that the Myanmar government simply decided that the long timescale of the project would not provide it ample revenue, and that the termination of western sanctions has given it other options. And despite these few lags in the economic relationship between the two countries, A large number of projects are still under way. During a visit to Myanmar in November 2014 by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, China and Myanmar signed investment deals in energy, agriculture, telecommunications, infrastructure and finance worth $7.8 billion. Like Letpadaung, the controversial Kyaukpyu-Kunming oil pipeline has been built despite massive public protest. Many in Rakhine State resent their small share of revenues. Villager grievances Villagers protesting the Letpadaung copper mine have expressed dissatisfaction with the resettlement process, compensation schemes, environmental and health effects, and the destruction of an important religious site. The compensation plan offered to the displaced villagers has been at the center of the protests since the beginning of the project. The agreement between Wanbao and the Myanmar Government held the company to certain standards of compensation, social spending and employment for residents. Wanbao and the Myanmar government have made claims of fairly compensating villagers which villagers and rights groups like Amnesty International have rejected as inadequate. Geng Yi, Wanbao‚Äôs local representative told The Economist magazine in May 2014 that the company was spending even more than required by that agreement. He claimed that the company spent $1.8m on ‚Äúcorporate social responsibility‚Äù work in 2013, which he said was more than the $1m that the contract requires each year. Additionally, 2% of profits are supposed to be allocated to local villages when the mine is operational. In December 2014 Wanbao Spokesman Dong Yunfei said in an Interview with the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) that the company intends to offer compensation to all 1,032 villagers affected by the mine. He said that about 70% of villagers have accepted the compensation offered by the company and that they have been working with and listening to affected villagers. For example, through ‚Äúdoor-to-door consultations‚Äù the company learned that many of those who have not accepted the plan and are protesting want higher compensation. The company has tried to accommodate, he claimed. In July they began a ‚ÄúLivelihood Contribution Plan‚Äù to help people who were promised jobs at the mine but which can only be fulfilled once the mine is totally operational. In statements Wanbao has conceded that about 100 villagers have refused to discuss compensation, despite several attempts. They have refused even to admit Wandbao employs, government officials and police officers into the ‚Äúthree old villages‚Äù in which they live. ‚ÄúWe learnt that quite a few villagers are actually willing to talk to us, but a few trouble-makers won‚Äôt let them,‚Äù Dong said, and added that the company would only pursue the matter through peaceful dialogue.

November 2012 white phosphorus Accounts of the violence that erupted on the morning of November 29, 2012 vary widely between protesters and rights groups on one hand and the government on the other. Thousands of villagers, monks and activists had been participating in protests at the mine site for the previous three months. Protests had generally taken the form of a sit-in, though in recent weeks protesters had become more daring, possibly emboldened by the recent visit of American President Barack Obama. Recently protesters had begun blockading the sulfuric acid factory that has been the subject of intense condemnation. Protesters had also been blocking bulldozers and trucks. National League for Democracy Chairwoman Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burmese independence leader Aung San and the most popular opposition figure in the country, was to meet with protesters at the mine on the morning of the following day, November 30, to hear their grievances. Police claim that they repeatedly warned the protesters to leave, saying that they had tolerated the ‚Äúillegal‚Äù protest for a long time but that the addition of people from other areas and ‚Äúoutside groups‚Äù had forced their hand. Police Lieutenant Colonel Thura Thwin Ko Ko, 49, one of commanders on duty during the clean-up, claims that protesters were warned fifteen times to disperse. Protesters dispute this narrative, saying that they were taken totally by surprise by the police move. A truckload of police arrived at the site of the protests shortly before the dispersal. Protesters say they formed in ranks to withstand the police action but were put to a run as soon as it began. A wanted sign for activists wanted for their connection to protests at the Letpadaung Copper mine. Protesters claim that they were fired upon by a combination of water cannons, tear gas, and an unspecific incendiary device.

It recognized that the mine had not met international environmental or social standards and did not compensate villagers sufficiently. To the disappointment of many protesters, however, the commission did not recommend the closing of the mine. Though it acknowledged the minimal direct benefit that the mine gave to Myanmar, the commission recommended that the mine remain open, citing Myanmar‚Äôs fragile relationship with China and the impact that shuttering such a large project could have on Myanmar‚Äôs internal investment climate. The commission provided for the creation of a Committee for the Implementation of the Letpadaung Report, tasked with implementing the recommendations outlined in the report. That committee has since come under intense criticism for a lack of transparency and sluggishness in implementing changes, not least from Aung San Suu Kyi, who claimed after the shooting in December 2014 that violence had erupted because of the Implementation Committee‚Äôs failure to implement the Investigation Committee‚Äôs recommendations. In response to criticisms from Aung San Suu Kyi, Tin Myint, a member of the investigation committee and the secretary of the implementation committee, said on January 8, 2015 that criticisms were unfounded. In its annual report the committee claimed to have already implemented 29 of the Investigation Committee‚Äôs recommendations, and to be in the process of implementing the remaining 13. December 2014 shooting On December 22, 2014 approximately 200 villagers were protesting the erecting of a border fence on 1,000 acres of farmland seized by the mine. The land was owned by villagers who had refused to accept the compensation plan offered by the mine. Villagers allegedly protested by throwing rocks and firing slingshots at workers and the police officers brought with them, and by physically blocking the work. In an interview with the Democratic Voice of Burma, a villager from Sete claimed that ‚ÄúThe police stood in a line, armed with riot shields, and warned the villagers they would be shot if they did not move‚Ä¶The protestors tried to block them from entering the plots and refused to give in.‚ÄùNaw Noreen, ‚ÄúRiot police open fire on Latpadaung protestors,‚Äù Democratic Voice of Burma, https://www.dvb.no/news/riot-police-open-fire-latpadaung-protestors/46803, (22 December 2014) When police opened fire one woman, 56-year-old woman from Mogyopin village, was shot in the head and died shortly afterwards.

The Myanmar Ministry of Information issued a report, run in state media outlets, which took a less conciliatory note than the statement made by Wanbao. The report said that tensions erupted when a group of about 30 protesting villagers prevented a bulldozer from clearing a path for an extension of the border fence by lying on the ground.

The following morning Nay Myo Zin, an activist and former Myanmar military servicemen, was arrested by waiting police as he began the trip to the Letpadaung site. Though they did not give specific charges, police allegedly told Nay Myo Zin that his arrest was due to his participation in the protests of the night before.

Beginning in Florence, the style spread to Rome and Venice and made the combination of dome, drum, and barrel vaults standard structural forms. Notable architects during the Italian Renaissance were Filippo Brunelleschi, builder of the dome of Florence Cathedral, Donato Bramante, Andrea Palladio, and Michelangelo, designer of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. Fifteenth centuryFlorence Cathedral= Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence. After years of considering options, Filippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti were made joint leaders of the project to build the dome for Florence Cathedral in 1420. Brunelleschi's plan to use suspended scaffolding for the workers won out over alternatives such as building a provisional stone support column in the center of the crossing or filling the space with earth. The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433. The roof lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death. It was completed in 1467. He had also planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of unclad masonry can be seen today. Although a portion of it was constructed on the southeast side beginning in 1508, work stopped after the visual effect was criticized by Michelangelo. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells. A stairway winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark the edges of the eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend from the base of the dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated iron cramps also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third of the way up the dome, and one two thirds of the way up the dome. Only four major cracks have been observed on the inner dome, compared to about fourteen each on the domes of the Pantheon and St. Peter's Basilica. Although the design of the dome is very different from that of the Pantheon and it is unclear what the influences were, it does share some similarities with earlier and smaller brick domes in Persia. The use of a herringbone pattern in the brick allowed for short horizontal sections of the layers of the dome to be completed as self-supporting units. Over 32 meters in height, it remains the largest masonry dome ever built. The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer. =Structure and style= The combination of dome, drum, pendentives, and barrel vaults developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century. Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome, then Venice. From the late 15th century, semicircular arches became preferred in Milan, but round domes were less successful due to structural difficulties compared to those with pointed profiles. Florence Old Sacristy of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence. The examples from Florence are mostly from the early Renaissance, in the fifteenth century. Cities within Florence's zone of influence, such as Genoa, Milan, and Turin, mainly produced examples later, from the sixteenth century on. Brunelleschi's domes at San Lorenzo and the Pazzi Chapel established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture. His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's Basilica of Santa Croce (1430‚Äì52) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. Twelve ribs between twelve circular windows converge on a small oculus. The circular dome rests on pendentives decorated with circular medallions of Florentine ceramic. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential. The dome of the Certosa di Pavia (1396‚Äì1473) has a ribbed or spoked wheel design. The dome of San Sisto in Piacenza (1499‚Äì1514) is circular and also includes pendentives with circular medallions. Another early example is Giuliano da Sangallo's 1485 design of a dome on the church of Santa Maria delle Carceri in Prato. Like that of the Pazzi Chapel, the dome is ribbed. Another Renaissance dome with a ribbed or spoked wheel design is that of the Madonna di Campagna in Piacenza (1522‚Äì1528). Rome De re aedificatoria, written by Leon Battista Alberti and dedicated to Pope Nicholas V around 1452, recommends vaults with coffering for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is Bernardo Rossellino. Under Pope Nicholas V, construction started between 1451 and 1455 on an extension of the old St. Peter's Basilica to create a Latin cross plan with a dome and lantern 100 braccia high over a crossing 44 braccia wide (about 24.5 meters wide). Little more than foundations and part of the choir walls were completed before work stopped with the death of Nicholas V. This innovation would culminate in Bramante's 1505‚Äì6 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica, and throughout the sixteenth century the Renaissance set of dome and barrel vault would displace use of Gothic ribbed vaults. Venice Venetian Renaissance architecture, perhaps delayed due to Venice's political independence, was blended with the existing Venetian architectural tradition of Eastern influence. Pietro Lombardo designed the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli (1481‚Äì89) with a dome over the sacristy. The masonry dome on a shallow drum and pendentives is covered by a taller outer wooden dome with a lantern. There is evident Byzantine influence in the line of three domes over the nave and crossing of the church of San Salvador, built between 1506 and 1534 by Giorgio Pietro Spavento and Tullio Lombardo. Sixteenth centuryBramante= Tempietto in Rome. The Tempietto, a small domed building modelled on the Temple of Vesta, was built in 1502 by Bramante in the cloister of San Pietro in Montorio to commemorate the site of St. Peter's martyrdom. It has inspired numerous copies and adaptations since, including Radcliffe Camera, the mausoleum at Castle Howard, and the domes of St. Peter's Basilica, St Paul's Cathedral, the Panth√©on, and the U.S. Capitol. Bramante's initial design for the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica was for a Greek cross plan with a large central hemispherical dome and four smaller domes around it in a quincunx pattern. Work began in 1506 and continued under a succession of builders over the next 120 years. Bramante's project for St. Peter's marks the beginning of the displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault. Proposed inspirations for Bramante's plan have ranged from some sketches of Leonardo da Vinci to the Byzantine quincunx church and the dome of Milan's Basilica of San Lorenzo. He completed the four massive central piers and the arches linking them by 1512, but cracking in the arches was detected between 1514 and 1534, possibly due to settling. The two eastern piers rest on solid marl and clay, while the other two rest upon remains of earlier Roman construction. That the piers and arches were left to stand with incomplete buttressing while construction stopped for over 30 years was also a factor. =Michelangelo= The Medici Chapel in Florence was designed by Michelangelo and built between 1521 and 1534. It contains the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici. Michelangelo inherited the project to design the dome of St. Peter's basilica in 1546. It had previously been in the hands of Bramante (with Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giovanni Giocondo) until 1514, Raphael Sanzio (assisted by Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giovanni Giocondo) until 1520, and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger (with Baldassare Peruzzi), whose work was disrupted by the sack of Rome in 1527. The design had been altered by Giuliano da Sangallo from being hemispherical to being 9 meters taller, segmental, and ribbed, and he had strengthened the piers and completed building the pendentives. Michelangelo redesigned the dome to have two shells, a mostly brick internal structure, and three iron chains to resist outward pressure. His dome was a lower, hemispherical design. He further strengthened the piers by eliminating niches in them and the internal spiral staircase. Michelangelo obtained a decree from Pope Julius III that threatened an interdiction against anyone who altered his design, completed construction of the base for the drum by May 1558, and spent November 1558 to December 1561 creating a detailed wooden model. Construction of the drum was completed a few months after he died in 1564. Sixteen pairs of columns project out between sixteen windows in the drum to act as buttresses, and are aligned with the sixteen ribs of the dome and the paired columns of the lantern. An artist and sculptor, rather than an engineer, Michelangelo's did not create full engineering plans for the dome and his model lacked construction details. The dome of St. Peter's basilica was later built by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. Plan and section of Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia in Rome =Ovals= The publication of Sebastiano Serlio's treatise, one of the most popular architectural treatises ever published, was responsible for the spread of the oval in late Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Book I (1545), on geometry, included techniques to create ovals, and Book V (1547), on architecture, included a design for an oval church. The first church with an oval dome in the Renaissance period was the Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia, built from 1550 to 1554 by Vignola. Use of the oval dome subsequently spread quickly through Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe. Such domes allowed for a synthesis of the two fundamental church types, longitudinal and central plan, and would become characteristic of Baroque architecture and the Counter- Reformation. The church of Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri (c. 1568‚Äì1575), designed by Vignola and completed by his son Giacinto Barozzi, was the first church to have an oval dome over an oval plan. =Palladio= The Villa Capra, also known as \\"La Rotunda\\", was built by Andrea Palladio from 1565 to 1569 near Vicenza. Its highly symmetrical square plan centers on a circular room covered by a dome, and it would prove highly influential on the Georgian architects of 18th century England, architects in Russia, and architects in America, Thomas Jefferson among them. Palladio's two domed churches in Venice are Il Redentore (1577‚Äì92) and San Giorgio Maggiore (1565‚Äì1610), the former built in thanksgiving for the end of a bad outbreak of plague in the city. =St. Peter's Basilica= St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City Pope Sixtus V appointed Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana in 1588 to begin construction of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica to Michelangelo's model. They made modifications to his design estimated to have reduced the tensile stresses in the dome by 40%, including thinning the two shells near the top, reducing the thickness and exterior projection of the ribs, raising the springing line by 4.8 meters, and changing the shape of the dome. Giacomo della Porta insisted on a vertically elliptical profile for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, for structural reasons, and construction began in June 1588. The dome was completed up to the base of the lantern in May 1590, a few months before the death of Pope Sixtus V. The lantern and lead covering for the dome were completed later, with the brass orb and cross being raised in 1592. The lantern is 17 meters high and the dome is 136.57 meters from the base to the top of the cross. The ogival dome was built with 16 ribs and an inner diameter of 42.7 meters. It begins above the drum and attico (the decorative strip above the drum), which are about 18 meters tall. The two shells of the dome are brick and each about 1.19 meters thick at the base of the dome. Because the shells separate from each other as they rise, the dome is 2.7 meters thick overall. The sixteen ribs connect the two shells together and are made of stone. Carlo Maderno's extended nave, built between 1609 and 1614, included bays covered by oval domes with lanterns. Cracks in the dome were noticed as early at 1603, when the mosaics covering the dome interior were completed, and additional cracks were recorded after 1631 and in 1742, demonstrating progression. Five more tie rings were added around the dome in 1743-44 by Luigi Vanvitelli. The iron chains included in the design to contain the dome's lateral thrust have had to be replaced ten times since it was constructed. Giovanni Poleni's 1748 report on the state of the dome, written in response to observed cracking, anticipated the safe theorem by stating \\"explicitly that the stability of a structure can be established unequivocally if it can be shown that the thrust line lies completely within the masonry.\\" His observation of cracks in the outer shell by the ribs has more recently been attributed by computer models to the heavy lantern.

Life Hashida was born in Seoul in 1925 while Korea was under Japanese control. She moved to Sakai City in Japan with her mother while she was still young. Sugako began studying Japanese literature at Japan Women's College in Tokyo in 1942 but her education was interrupted by World War II. Although her family had lost its savings, she was able later to continue her education, transferring to the Department of Art at Waseda University. Hashida acknowledges that she discovered the work of Kikuchi Kan during her studies and these were a substantial influence on her later work. After completing her studies, she found work in the script department of Shochiku. She was laid off in 1960 but continue to write scripts on a freelance basis and supplemented her income by writing short stories for girls' magazines. In 1965, she married Hiroshi Iwasaki, a producer for the Tokyo Broadcasting System. In 1973, she wrote the script for the television drama Ai to Shi o Mitsumete. This was followed by other successful scripts: the series Tonari no Shibafu (1976‚Äì77), Oshin (1983‚Äì84), F≈´fu (1979), Michi (1980), Onnatachi no Chuushingura (1981) and Dakazoku (1983). An English-dubbed version of Tonari no Shibafu, The Grass Is Greener on the Other Side, was shown on American cable during the early 1980s. Oshin, a serialised morning TV drama or asadora, was the first asadora to be both produced and written by women in Japan. Hashida is known particularly for writing Oshin, but she can be considered Japan's most successful TV drama script writer.

Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used at the base of domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of the room to the dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.  Medieval period  Alai Dawarza in Delhi. The earliest examples include the half-domes of the late 13th century tomb of Balban and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes. The Alai Dawarza, a gate in the Qutb complex built in 1311, has the first dome in India made of finely dressed stone cut into voussoir blocks. Arches transition a square chamber to an octagon, which transitions to a sixteen-sided polygon through the use of corbelled brackets. The cut stone dome over the tomb of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq (d. 1325) uses alternating rings of shallow and deep stones to produce a better bond with the core material. The use of finely cut stone voussoirs for these domes suggest the migration of masons from the former Seljuk Empire. Domes from the late 14th century use roughly shaped stones covered in render, due to the dispersal of skilled masons following the movement of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad and back again. Examples include the Khirki Masjid (c. 1375) and the tomb of Firoz Shah (d. 1388). The domed tomb of Khan-i-Jahan Tilangani (1368) is generally referred to as \\"the first octagonal tomb in Delhi with the domed central chamber surrounded by an ambulatory verandah with three arched openings on each facet\\", although it is predated by the tomb of Zafar Khan. Under the Lodi dynasty there was a large proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period. There are multiple candidates. The tomb of Sikander Lodi was built from 1517 to 1518 and is cited, but is predated by the brick tomb of Zain-ul-Abidin's mother, built around 1465 in Zaina Kadal, Srinagar. The Sabz Burj in Delhi may be earlier still, but is dated to 1530-40 by written sources. Although the tomb of Sikander Loki clearly has a double dome, with a distinct space between inner and outer shells, the earlier tomb of Shihab-ud-din Taj Khan (1501) has \\"an attempt in this direction\\". Although double domes had long been used in Persia, Iraq, and western Asia, Indian domes prior to this time domes had a single shell of stonework. Afterward, most of the large domes were built with two shells in order to preserve good proportions in both the interior and exterior. The Data durbar in Lahore, Pakistan, is the largest Sufi complex in South Asia. According to Anna Suvorova, author of Muslim Saints in South Asia: The Eleventh to Fifteenth Centuries: > The domed cupola design of Data Durbar is typical of the pre-Mughal Muslim > architecture of South Asia: while erecting the cupolas topping a square > building, an intermediate form of squinches or arched transitional supports > was used.

Early modern period The first major Mughal building is the domed tomb of Humayun, built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central dome likely has a core of brick, as can be seen in the later stripped tomb of Khan- i-Khanan. The central dome is faced with marble blocks in attached to the core by alternating wide and narrow layers and there is evidence of the use of iron cramps to secure them. Iron cramps may also help form a tension ring at the base of the dome. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed chattri made of brick and faced with stone. Smaller domes were widely made with rectangular bricks beginning in the 16th century, the necessary curvature being created by tapering the mortar joints. Chatris, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as cenotaphs. The Taj Mahal in Agra, India. The Taj Mahal in Agra, also a brick structure clad primarily in marble, was begun in 1632 and mostly completed in 1636; the rest of the extensive complex would not be finished before 1643. The tomb was built for Mumtaz Mahal, a wife of emperor Shah Jahan, after her death in 1631. The central double dome covers a diameter of 22 meters. The inner dome is three meters thick and over 30 meters below the outer dome. The outer dome rests upon drum walls five metes thick. The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture can be seen in the dome's shape: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the finial with lotus leaf base is derived from Hindu temples. The inner dome has a decorative triangulated pattern modeled after plaster mold work, but here carved in marble. The entire complex is highly symmetrical. On the western side of the tomb is a red sandstone mosque with three bulbous domes faced with marble, and on the eastern side is mirror- image assembly hall that likewise has three marble domes. At the center of the tomb hall lies the cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal, with her husband's off-center to the west. The actual sarcophagi lie directly below, in the crypt, but in the same arrangement. The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the tomb of Safdar Jang (1753‚Äì54). It is a brick structure clad in sandstone and marble stripped from the earlier tomb of Khan-i-Khanan (d. 1627). Shallow brick domes cover the perimeter chambers of the building, and the central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top. The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, India. The tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah (d. 1656) in Bijapur is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. Called the Gol Gumbaz, or Round Dome, it has an internal diameter of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters. The dome was built with layers of brick between thick layers of mortar and rendered on both faces, so that the dome acts as a concrete shell reinforced with bricks. It is 2.6 meters thick at the base. The dome was the most technically advanced to be built in the Deccan, and exemplifies the flowering of art and architecture that occurred during the period of the Adil Shahi Sultanate's greatest extent. Radial cracks were repaired in 1936-7 by the application of reinforcement to the outside of the dome, which was then covered by sprayed concrete. Both the Gol Gumbaz dome and the smaller dome of the Jama Masjid, a 57-foot wide dome also at Bijapur, are above distinctive transition zones consisting of eight intersecting arches that narrow the openings to be covered. The bulbous domes of the Badshahi mosque in Lahore, Pakistan. The Badshahi Mosque, one of the jewels of Mughal architecture, and South Asia's second-largest mosque, built by Aurengzeb between 1671 and 1673, is describes by historian Catherine B. Asher as: > The prayer chamber adheres generally to the plan of Shah Jahan's Delhi > mosque constructed about two decades earlier, although it is considerably > larger. While closely modeled on Shah Jahan-period congregational mosques, > the Badshahi mosque reveals a greater sense of spatial tension in keeping > with the new aesthetic established early in Aurangzeb's reign. This is > achieved, in part, by the sheer scale of the complex and by the facade's > arched openings that are small in comparison to the building's overall > massive size. Further underscoring this spatial tension are the bulbous > domes and the minarets at the compound corners that emphasize the sense of > verticality. Domes appear frequently in Sikh architecture, which was greatly influenced by Mughal architecture. Most of Historical Sikh buildings were built towards the end of 18th century. Domes in Sikh architecture are mostly ribbed with lotus design at the top and floral motifs at the bottom. These domes start with wide base and reach maximum circumference when they are less than halfway up.

Analytical approaches were developed and the ideal shape for a dome was debated, but these approaches were often considered too theoretical to be used in construction. The Gothic ribbed vault was displaced with a combination of dome and barrel vaults in the Renaissance style throughout the sixteenth century. The use of lantern towers, or timburios, which hid dome profiles on the exterior declined in Italy as the use of windowed drums beneath domes increased, which introduced new structural difficulties. The spread of domes in this style outside of Italy began with central Europe, although there was often a stylistic delay of a century or two. Use of the oval dome spread quickly through Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe and would become characteristic of Counter-Reformation architecture in the Baroque style. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns were used at the top of important sixteenth-century spires, beginning in the Netherlands. Traditional Orthodox church domes were used in hundreds of Orthodox and Uniate wooden churches in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and Tatar wooden mosques in Poland were domed central plan structures with adjacent minarets. The fully developed onion dome was prominent in Prague by the middle of the sixteenth century and appeared widely on royal residences. Bulbous domes became popular in central and southern Germany and in Austria in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and influenced those in Poland and Eastern Europe in the Baroque period. However, many bulbous domes in the larger cities of eastern Europe were replaced during the second half of the eighteenth century in favor of hemispherical or stilted cupolas in the French or Italian styles. Only a few examples of domed churches from the 16th century survive from the Spanish colonization of Mexico. An anti-seismic technique for building called quincha was adapted from local Peruvian practice for domes and became universally adopted along the Peruvian coast. A similar lightweight technique was used in eastern Sicily after earthquakes struck in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Although never very popular in domestic settings, domes were used in a number of 18th century homes built in the Neoclassical style. In the United States, small cupolas were used to distinguish public buildings from private residences. After a domed design was chosen for the national capitol, several states added prominent domes to their assembly buildings.  Developments  The construction of domes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries relied primarily on empirical techniques and oral traditions rather than the architectural treatises of the times, which avoided practical details. This was adequate for domes up to medium size, with diameters in the range of 12 to 20 meters. Materials were considered homogeneous and rigid, with compression taken into account and elasticity ignored. The weight of materials and the size of the dome were the key references. Lateral tensions in a dome were counteracted with horizontal rings of iron, stone, or wood incorporated into the structure. Traditional geometric rules of proportion for domes were applied by master builders regardless of size, but helped new domes be built in forms known to be safe. The structural behavior of previous domed buildings acted as full-scale models to inform new ones and small scale models of new projects were also relied upon. The first rotating observatory dome was built in the sixteenth century, in Kassel. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many Renaissance and Baroque elliptical and oval plan domes were built over rectangular naves, using brick in Italy and stone in Spain. Later German oval domes in the Rococo style used different combinations of geometry. Elliptical dome traces were published by Durero (1525), Serlio (1545), and De L'Orme (1561) along with practical methods of achieving the shape using circular arcs, the technique used from the time of the ancient Romans. Alonso de Vandelvira published a description of the geometry of oval domes around 1580 with orthogonal projections of meridian and parallel rib curves. Oval domes often incorporated both elliptical and oval or semicircular curves and this ambiguity is reflected in the architectural literature. Builders relied on graphical or empirical solutions to such geometric problems. In 1640, mathematician Paul Guldin established that the \\"elongated semicircle\\" of traditional practice is an ellipse. Although some recommendations for the profile of a dome can be found in treatises from earlier centuries, the traditional geometric and proportional techniques for masonry domes and lanterns were first detailed in 1694 by Carlo Fontana in his famous treatise Il Tempio Vaticano e sua Origine. Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, developments in mathematics and the study of statics led to a more precise formalization of the ideas of the traditional constructive practices of arches and vaults, and there was a diffusion of studies on what was considered the most stable form for these structures: the catenary curve. In 1704, James Bernoulli wrote that an inverted catenary arch of any thickness will resist its own weight, which likely inspired Pierre Bouguer to conclude in his M√©moire sur le lignes courbes qui sont propres √† former les vo√ªtes en d√¥mes (1734) that the optimal shape was a rotated inverted semi-catenary. Building on Fontana's work, Bernardo Antonio Vittone published Istruzioni elementari dell‚Äôarchitettura civile in 1760, in which he recommended using ogival or ellipsoidal profiles to increase the proportional height of domes and increasing the angle at which they intersected with their lanterns, for both structural and aesthetic reasons. To counter the negative impact this raised profile has on the interior appearance, domes with two or three layers of vaults were built, with openings in the lower levels to admit light. Analytical approaches were also being developed and debated in the eighteenth century, particularly between French and Italian mathematicians and architects, but were considered too theoretical to be used in construction. The study of dome structures changed radically, with domes being considered as a composition of smaller elements, each subject to mathematical and mechanical laws and easier to analyse individually, rather than being considered as whole units unto themselves. In 1734, mathematician Pierre Bouguer (and later others) argued that the dome could be thought of as sliced into a series of independent wedged-shaped segments meeting as arches. Therefore, a dome as a whole was stable if each constituent arch was stable and analysis of a dome could be performed the same way as analysis of an arch. In the late eighteenth century, the ideal shape for a dome was debated by Charles Bossut, Lorenzo Mascheroni, , and , among others.  Sixteenth century  Italian Renaissance = A combination of barrel vaults, pendentives, drum, and dome developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century. Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome, and then Venice. Domes in the renaissance style in Florence are mostly from the early period, in the fifteenth century. Cities within Florence's zone of influence, such as Genoa, Milan, and Turin, mainly produced examples later, from the sixteenth century on. Papal States Tempietto in Rome The Tempietto in Rome, a small domed building modelled on the Temple of Vesta, was built in 1502 by Bramante in the cloister of San Pietro in Montorio to commemorate the site of St. Peter's martyrdom. It has inspired numerous copies and adaptations since, including Radcliffe Camera, the mausoleum at Castle Howard, and the domes of St. Peter's Basilica, St Paul's Cathedral, the Panth√©on, and the U.S. Capitol. Bramante's 1505-6 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica mark the beginning of the displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault, which proceeded throughout the sixteenth century. Bramante's studies for new church designs for St. Peter's coincided with Leonardo da Vinci's studies of centrally planned churches while they were both at the court of Ludovico Sforza in Milan and they may have collaborated. Their studies may have influenced many of the centrally planned churches built in the first half of the sixteenth century, such as the church of Santa Maria della Consolazione (started around 1508) and the church of the Madonna di San Biagio at Montepulciano (1518-1545). Although Bramante designed a low dome like that of the Pantheon for the church of Santa Maria della Consolazione in Todi, a building ordered by the ruling Atti family to mark the site of a 1508 miracle, the design changed in 1587 to a dome and drum on pendentives. =St. Peter's Basilica= St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City Bramante's initial design for the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica was for a Greek cross plan with a large central hemispherical dome and four smaller domes around it in a quincunx pattern. Work began in 1506 and continued under a succession of builders over the next 120 years. Bramante's project for St. Peter's marks the beginning of the displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault. Proposed inspirations for Bramante's plan have ranged from some sketches of Leonardo da Vinci to the Byzantine quincunx church and the dome of Milan's Basilica of San Lorenzo. Bramante is said to have likened his design to placing the Pantheon on top of the Basilica of Constantine. He completed the four massive central piers and the arches linking them by 1512, but cracking in the arches was detected between 1514 and 1534, possibly due to settling. The two eastern piers rest on solid marl and clay, while the other two rest upon remains of earlier Roman construction. That the piers and arches were left to stand with incomplete buttressing while construction stopped for over 30 years was also a factor. Michelangelo inherited the project to design the dome of St. Peter's basilica in 1546. It had previously been in the hands of Bramante (with Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giovanni Giocondo) until 1514, Raphael Sanzio (assisted by Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giovanni Giocondo) until 1520, and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger (with Baldassare Peruzzi), whose work was disrupted by the sack of Rome in 1527. The design had been altered by Giuliano da Sangallo from being hemispherical to being 9 meters taller, segmental, and ribbed, and he had strengthened the piers and completed building the pendentives. Michelangelo redesigned the dome to have two shells, a mostly brick internal structure, and three iron chains to resist outward pressure. His dome was a lower, hemispherical design. He further strengthened the piers by eliminating niches in them and the internal spiral staircase. Michelangelo obtained a decree from Pope Julius III that threatened an interdiction against anyone who altered his design, completed construction of the base for the drum by May 1558, and spent November 1558 to December 1561 creating a detailed wooden model. Construction of the drum was completed a few months after he died in 1564. Sixteen pairs of columns project out between sixteen windows in the drum to act as buttresses, and are aligned with the sixteen ribs of the dome and the paired columns of the lantern. An artist and sculptor, rather than an engineer, Michelangelo's did not create full engineering plans for the dome and his model lacked construction details. The dome of St. Peter's basilica was later built by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. Pope Sixtus V appointed Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana in 1588 to begin construction of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica to Michelangelo's model. They made modifications to his design estimated to have reduced the tensile stresses in the dome by 40%, including thinning the two shells near the top, reducing the thickness and exterior projection of the ribs, raising the springing line by 4.8 meters, and changing the shape of the dome. Giacomo della Porta insisted on a vertically elliptical profile for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, for structural reasons, and construction began in June 1588. The dome was completed up to the base of the lantern in May 1590, a few months before the death of Pope Sixtus V. The lantern and lead covering for the dome were completed later, with the brass orb and cross being raised in 1592. The lantern is 17 meters high and the dome is 136.57 meters from the base to the top of the cross. The ogival dome was built with 16 ribs and an inner diameter of 42.7 meters. It begins above the drum and attico (the decorative strip above the drum), which are about 18 meters tall. The two shells of the dome are brick and each about 1.19 meters thick at the base of the dome. Because the shells separate from each other as they rise, the dome is 2.7 meters thick overall. The sixteen ribs connect the two shells together and are made of stone. Carlo Maderno's extended nave for St. Peter's Basilica, built between 1609 and 1614, included bays covered by oval domes with lanterns. Cracks in the dome were noticed as early at 1603, when the mosaics covering the dome interior were completed, and additional cracks were recorded after 1631 and in 1742, demonstrating progression. Five more tie rings were added around the dome in 1743-44 by Luigi Vanvitelli. The iron chains included in the design to contain the dome's lateral thrust have had to be replaced ten times since it was constructed. Giovanni Poleni's 1748 report on the state of the dome, written in response to observed cracking, anticipated the safe theorem by stating \\"explicitly that the stability of a structure can be established unequivocally if it can be shown that the thrust line lies completely within the masonry.\\" His observation of cracks in the outer shell by the ribs has more recently been attributed by computer models to the heavy lantern. Republic of Venice Villa Capra, or \\"La Rotonda\\", near Vicenza. In Venice, there is evident Byzantine influence in the line of three domes over the nave and crossing of the church of San Salvador, built between 1506 and 1534 by Giorgio Pietro Spavento and Tullio Lombardo. The Villa Capra, also known as \\"La Rotunda\\", was built by Andrea Palladio from 1565 to 1569 near Vicenza. Its highly symmetrical square plan centers on a circular room covered by a dome, and it would prove highly influential on the Georgian architects of 18th century England, architects in Russia, and architects in America, Thomas Jefferson among them. Commissioned by count and churchman Paolo Almerico, Palladio designed a dome for the residence because he believed that the Latin meaning of \\"domus\\" being \\"house\\" indicated that ancient Roman houses were domed. Palladio's two domed churches in Venice are Il Redentore (1577‚Äì92) and San Giorgio Maggiore (1565‚Äì1610), the former built in thanksgiving for the end of a bad outbreak of plague in the city. Inspired by these churches, the two- domed church of Santa Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena was built on the edge of Venice's Grand Canal from 1631 to 1681 to celebrate the end of a plague in the city in 1630. The larger dome is 130 feet tall over an octagonal nave for public ceremonies and the smaller dome covers the choir used by the clergy for official celebrations. The architect attributed the shape of the domed church to a crown evoked by the dedication of the church to Mary, Queen of Heaven. Republic of Florence The Medici Chapel in Florence was designed by Michelangelo and built between 1521 and 1534. It contains the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici. In 1569, the dome over the church of Madonna dell'Umilt√† in Pistoia was completed by Giorgio Vasari at the behest of Cosimo I de' Medici, over a building designed and built by others. Although clearly referencing Florence Cathedral visually and in the use of two shells, structurally the octagonal dome is similar to the much earlier dome of Florence Baptistery and the hemispherical shape of Michelangelo's design for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. Cracks discovered shortly after completion necessitated the addition by Vasari of iron chains on the inside and outside, but structural problems have continued and additional chains have been added over the centuries, many outside of the dome. The instability has been attributed to Vasari's design. = Counter-Reformation and oval domes = Churches with oval plans begin to be built in the middle of the sixteenth century and oval or elliptical domes would become characteristic of Counter- Reformation architecture in the Baroque style. The publication of Sebastiano Serlio's treatise, one of the most popular architectural treatises ever published, was responsible for the spread of the oval in late Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Book I (1545), on geometry, included techniques to create ovals, and Book V (1547), on architecture, included a design for an oval church. The first church with an oval dome in the Renaissance period was the Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia, built from 1550 to 1554 by Vignola. Use of the oval dome subsequently spread quickly through Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe. Such domes allowed for a synthesis of the two fundamental church types, longitudinal and central plan, and would become characteristic of Baroque architecture and the Counter-Reformation. The church of Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri (c. 1568‚Äì1575), designed by Vignola and completed by his son Giacinto Barozzi, was the first church to have an oval dome over an oval plan. Many Italian examples of oval domes have semi-circular cross sections, which allowed for easier construction using semi-circular transverse centering. Vignola's oval plan church of Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri was the first to be built within Rome, and was designed in 1572 with seven windows between the eight ribs in its oval dome. The windows introduced structural complications that Vignola had avoided in his first oval dome over the rectangular plan church of Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia, but the restrictions of the site necessitated light from above. The oval plan church of San Giacomo degli Incurabili was started in 1592 by a student of Vignola's, Francesco Capriani, and finished by Carlo Maderno. It also has ribs between the six windows in its dome, but they are concealed on the interior. The design of this church would inspire others over the next two centuries, aided by the building activity of the many new religious orders founded between 1524 and 1621. Toward the end of the sixteenth century, transepts with domes were popular in several Italian states and were featured in prominent churches such as the Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua (begun in 1532), Mantua Cathedral (added after 1540), Church of the Ges√π in Rome (1568‚Äì1580), and San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice (begun in 1566). The domes of the Abbey of Sants Giustina in Padua may have been inspired by those of il Santo. = House of Habsburg =Habsburg Netherlands Charles V in 1556. In the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the Near East had exposed the Low Countries of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the Orient and they were adopted in the architecture of the Netherlands. In Ghent, an octagonal staircase tower for the Church of St. Martin d'Ackerghem, built in the beginning of the sixteenth century, had a bulbous cupola similar to a Syrian minaret. These cupolas were made of wood covered with copper, as were the examples over turrets and towers in the Netherlands at the end of the fifteenth century, many of which have been lost. The earliest example from the Netherlands that has survived is the bulbous cupola built in 1511 over the town hall of Middelburg. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the following decades. The onion shape was used at the top of important sixteenth-century spires such as the Onze Lieve Vrouw Kerk in Haarlem, the 1566 Oude Kerk in Amsterdam, and the 1599 cheese market of Alkmaar. Prague In Prague, the welsche Haube was apparently little used, but the fully developed onion dome was prominent by the middle of the sixteenth century. The development of the onion shape in Prague architecture may have been an effort to blend Gothic forms with those from Italy, and may also indicate influence from the Netherlands. Drawings published in carpentry manuals and the prestigious association of onion spires with pilgrimage churches encouraged their adoption in the nearby regions of Bavaria, Southern Germany and the Austrian Empire. Drawings of the city of Prague from 1562 and 1606 show towers and spires capped with onion domes. They are seen on the Rosenberg Palace, the , and the main spire of St. Vitus Cathedral (1561-1563), the design of which had been approved by Emperor Ferdinand in 1560. Milan Phillip II in 1580. Milan, between 1550 and 1650, initiated construction of domes for many important churches. Domes in the Lombard region were traditionally hidden externally by lantern towers called timburios, a technique dating from late Antiquity whose structural behavior was well known, but this began to change starting in the 1560s. Domes exposed externally, or \\"extradoxed\\", were proposed by architect Pellegrino Tibaldi for the church of church of San Fedele (1568‚Äì69), the church of San Sebastiano (1578-86), and the (1571). However, the planned extradoxed dome of San Sebastiano had a timburio added and many domes continued to be planned with timburios from the outset. Examples include the Trivulzio chapel in the church of San Nazaro in Brolo (1547), and the churches of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Santa Maria presso San Celso (started in 1497), Santa Maria della Passione (1549-1550), and San Vittore al Corpo (1568-1573). The use of drums beneath domes began in Milan following the trend in Rome and central Italy. They improved lighting for domes but also introduced additional structural problems. Spain and its colonies The \\"Murcia Dome\\" over the Chapel of the Junterones in Murcia Cathedral, built in 1540 by , has a torical geometry achieved by the revolution of a transverse semicircular arch about the oblong plan's short axis. In 1564, a dome on a drum was completed over the vestry of the church of San Miguel in Jerez de la Frontera, a rare Spanish example built before those of El Escorial. The domes over the church and towers of El Escorial, built between 1579 and 1582 as extradosed domes on drums, became a model for subsequent Spanish domes, particularly after Juan de Herrera's publication of the main dome's cross-section in 1589. The main dome over the church is a stone spherical dome and lantern on a cylindrical drum and has an internal diameter of 18.94 meters. Smaller versions with internal diameters of 6.68 meters top the two church towers. The influence of the dome at El Escorial is evident in domes at the church of the College of Nosa Se√±ora da Antiga in Monforte de Lemos (redesigned after 1592 to be extradosed and have a drum), Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi in Valencia (altered to include a drum between 1595 and 1597), the church of San Pablo and San Justo in Granada (completed in 1622 with a similar drum), and in the domed tower at the Monastery of Irache. The similarities in the dome over Cerralbo Chapel at Ciudad Rodrigo, which does not have a drum, include the proportions of the dome thickness, the lantern diameter, and the use of horizontal stone courses in the lower portion of the dome up to 32 degrees, rather than radial courses. Global map of territory under Phillip II in 1598. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, from the 16th to the 18th centuries, thousands of churches were built in Mexico. The churches vary, but surviving examples from central Mexico are typically on a latin cross plan with a brick dome on a drum at the crossing. Adobe was widely used in early examples but these buildings were often destroyed by earthquakes or replaced. Thick rib cross- vaulting in a dome-like shape was used in the 16th century. Most churches used a bell-gable instead of a bell tower, although stone bell towers were often added in later centuries, typically topped by a small hemispherical dome. Vaults and domes were usually built with brick and, like towers, were particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Domes developed vertical cracks from the lateral movement and were more vulnerable than vaults because movement in the drums beneath them could increase the damage. A large amount of movement in a single event or the cumulative effect of multiple earthquakes could result in collapse. Only a few examples from the 16th century survive. Tratado de Arquitectura, from around 1580, is the first Spanish scientific treatise and contains the first recorded definitions of the geometry of meridian and parallel ribs for six kinds of oval domes. It is evidence of the scientific and cultural exchange occurring with Italy in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Early oval domes built in Spain in the second half of the sixteenth century include the crossing dome of the cathedral of Cordoba and the chapter house dome of Seville Cathedral. Vandelvira's late sixteenth century treatise included studies of sail vaults of various types, such as those with a system of crossed arches supporting the structure. The 1540 church at Cazalla, Sevilla has examples. = Central and eastern Europe = Russian architecture strongly influenced the many bulbous domes of the wooden churches of Bohemia and Silesia, such as the in Pni√≥w and the . This type blended into German rural architecture such that, in Bavaria, bulbous domes less resemble Dutch models than Russian ones. The polygonal domes on the towers of the Frauenkirche in Munich from about 1530 and the hexagonal domes of the town hall of Augsburg from 1615 are examples. Domes like these gained in popularity in central and southern Germany and in Austria in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly in the Baroque style. Dresden in particular has outstanding examples, including the lantern over the large central dome of the Dresden Frauenkirche (1726‚Äì39). A ch√¢teau in Dresden with a tower dome from 1535 was remodeled from 1547 to 1557 to have a series of bell-shaped domes, according to a wooden model. Basilica of the Holy Trinity in Che≈Çm≈ºa, Poland. The spread of the Renaissance style dome outside of Italy began with central Europe. Although there was often a stylistic delay of a century or two, Germany and Poland have a number of important examples, such as the Polish Sigismund's Chapel in Krak√≥w (1517‚Äì1533). As elements likely associated with Roman Catholic church buildings at this time, the use of domed transepts outside Italy may indicate partiality towards Roman Catholicism over Protestantism. Examples include a church in DƒÖbrowa Zielona (1554), a Jesuit church in Nie≈õwie≈º (1586‚Äì1599), and a Jesuit church in Krak√≥w. In the early sixteenth century, the lantern of the Italian dome had spread to Germany as a wood and copper cupola called the welsche Haube (\\"Italian hood\\") and this structure gradually adopted the bulbous cupola from the Netherlands. The first such example was on the tower of the town hall of Emden (1574‚Äì76) and other early examples were on the town halls of Brzeg, Silesia (1570‚Äì76), Rothenburg ob der Tauber (1572‚Äì78), and Lemgo (c. 1589). Early examples in Danzig, such as the tower of the town hall (1561) and the tower of the church of St. Catherine (1634), show Dutch and possibly Russian influence. Onion-shaped domes appeared widely on royal residences in the middle of the sixteenth century. In addition to those on the eastern part of Prague Castle, royal residences in Madrid, London, Vienna, and Krak√≥w had them, always as part of Italian classical forms. In Poland, Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches maintained the forms developed during the Middle Ages, such as Greek cross plans or longitudinal plans in three parts with each part covered by a dome, but with updated styling. Examples include the Walachian church of Paulo Dominici (1591-1629), the (c. 1600), and the (after 1671).  Seventeenth century Spanish Habsburgs= In Spain, oval churches of the seventeenth century include the , begun in 1617, the in Valencia around 1650, and the Oratory of San Filippo Neri in C√°diz at the end of the century. Architect built oval domes over his churches of in 1616 and San Antonio de los Alemanes in 1624. Giuseppe Nuvolo built the church of San Carlo all'Arena around 1626 in Naples, the first of several oval plan churches that would be built there until the middle of the eighteenth century. The Basilica of San Lorenzo in Milan. In Milan, proposals for the dome of San Lorenzo (built in 1619) included versions both with and without timburios, although, along with the quincunx plan Church of Sant'Alessandro, the building had the more difficult supporting structure of four main arches between four free-standing pillars. A dome for Sant'Alessandro was built in 1626 and demolished in 1627, perhaps due to the use of an inadequate number of iron ties. Although the dome had a timburio, it may also have had a lower and less stable hemispherical form. Autographed drawings from the period indicate it was a ribbed hemispherical dome with a lantern and timburio. Deep cracks in the arches supporting the dome caused the completed dome to be demolished, along with the supporting arches in February 1627. In 1629, the supporting piers were enlarged and the four round arches were strengthened with iron reinforcement and by adding pointed arches above them. An outbreak of disease stopped work in 1630 and the dome was not completed until 1693, with an extrados shape. Saint Peter's Abbey in Ghent was rebuilt in 1629, having been destroyed in the Protestant uprising that began in the Netherlands in 1568, a part of the Eighty Years' War. The church was rebuilt in an Italian Baroque style with one of the first church domes in the Southern Netherlands, just after the completion of the domed Basilica of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel, and seems to have been intended to convey a counter-reformation message. In Spain, false vaults made of wood or reed and covered with plaster were used in the seventeenth century. The technique, dating from the medieval period, was applied to chapel domes to give the appearance of stone construction. The dome of Seville's (begun 1659) used stucco to create high-relief scrolling foliage patterns like those of Islamic arabesque ornament. In Granada, stuccowork was introduced by Francisco Hurtado Izquierdo and used to embellish classical forms in the dome (c. 1702) and sacristy dome (c. 1713‚Äì42) of La Cartuja, in contrast to earlier vaults such as that of San Jer√≥nimo (1523‚Äì43), which used diagonal ribs in an idiosyncratic way and had apparent Moorish influences. In Lima, the \\"City of Kings\\", capital of Spain's Viceroyalty of Peru, frequent earthquakes prompted the use of quincha construction for the vaulting of the church of San Francisco (1657-74) by Constantino de Vasconcelos and Manuel de Escobar. Quincha was an adaptation of an indigenous wattle and daub technique and consisted of a wooden structural framework filled out with cane or bamboo and covered with plaster and stucco to resemble stone. The anti-seismic properties of this light and elastic system allowed the 36.9 foot wide double- shell dome of the church, a hemisphere and lantern resting directly on pendentives, to survive for more than three hundred years and it became universally adopted along the Peruvian coast. Another 17th century example is the dome of the church of Santo Domingo in Lima (1678-81). A lightweight dome made with a wooden frame, woven reeds, and plastered with a gypsum mortar was built over Messina Cathedral in Sicily in 1682. Known to react better than masonry vaulting to earthquakes, this technique was also more expensive due to the need for specialized artisans and the use of white poplar wood in the structure, which unlike traditional wooden formwork could not be re-used and was rare on the island. It was used in eastern Sicily after earthquakes struck in 1693 and 1727. =Austrian Habsburgs and the Holy Roman Empire= The Augsburg Town Hall (1615-1620), designed by Lutheran architect Elias Holl, included two towers topped by onion domes and these became part of the city's civic identity by the later seventeenth century. Like the town hall, the Lutheran churches of and have onion domes. Oval domes can also be found in the Amalienburg pavilion at Schloss Nymphenburg, Munich. Onion spires are predominant in Bavarian country churches, such as those on the three towers of the 1688 near Waldsassen by Abraham Leuthner and Georg Dientzenhofer, who had both worked in Prague. Onion domes over the Bavarian pilgrimage churches of (1661‚Äì1682) and (1670) may also indicate influence from Prague through models in architectural design books, such as one by Abraham Leuthner. In other examples, such as the onion dome on the tower of St. Ulrich's and St. Afra's Abbey (1602), the influences are less clear. German and Austrian influence resulted in many bulbous cupolas in Poland and Eastern Europe in the Baroque period, and rural church towers in the Austrian and Bavarian Alps still feature them. Onion-shaped spires can be found in rural and pilgrimage churches in southern Germany, northeastern Italy, the former Czechoslovakia, Austria, and some of Poland, Hungary, and the former Yugoslavia. Church of San Lorenzo in Turin. In the Church of San Lorenzo (1670‚Äì87) in Turin, Guarino Guarini, a Theatine monk and mathematician, used interlacing bands or ribs reminiscent of Islamic domes at Iznik or Cordoba, or the . The four years he spent in Paris may have influenced the emphasis on forced perspective and optical effects in his domes, in contrast to the more formalistic architectural design of Rome at that time. He used form, color, and light to give the illusion of greater height in his centralized domed churches. His dome over the Chapel of the Holy Shroud (1667‚Äì90) in Turin is supported by six stacked hexagonal layers of six arches each, arranged such that each layer of arches spring from the peaks of the arches in the layer below them. Although the layers form a cone leading to the base of the dome, each is made progressively smaller to exaggerate the appearance of height. The dome itself is a lighter color than the lower levels of the church, also making it appear even farther away. The ribs in San Lorenzo and Il Sidone were shaped as catenary curves. The idea of a large oculus in a solid dome revealing a second dome originated with Guarini. He established the oval dome as a reconciliation of the longitudinal plan church favored by the liturgy of the Counter- Reformation and the centralized plan favored by idealists. Guarini's drawings, including isometric intersections of spheres, barrel vaults, and oval domes as well as drawings explaining construction and ceiling patterns, were published posthumously in the Architettura Civile and influenced the designs of Hildebrandt, the Dientzenhofers, and Balthasar Neumann in Central Europe. With the newly developed mathematics of calculus, these experimental designs could be proven and would become the foundation of Rococo spatial arrangements. =Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth= Polish examples of churches with domed transepts include a collegiate church in the city of ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew (1606‚Äì1618), a Franciscan church in ≈öwiƒôta Anna near Przyr√≥w (1609‚Äì1617), (1624‚Äì1627), (1624‚Äì1629), and (founded in 1631). In Poland, polygonal buildings and earlier medieval towers were often capped with domes in the Renaissance or Baroque styles. The Renaissance domes were generally onion domes stacked on top of one another and separated with so-called lanterns of openwork arcades. An example is the tower at the Basilica of the Holy Trinity in Che≈Çm≈ºa. The Baroque domes were characterized by unusual shapes and curves, such as those of Gniezno Cathedral. However, many bulbous domes in the larger cities of eastern Europe were replaced during the second half of the eighteenth century in favor of hemispherical or stilted cupolas in the French or Italian styles. In the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Roman Catholic churches with Greek-cross plans and monumental domes designed by Tylman van Gameren became popular in the last quarter of the seventeenth century. Examples include St. Kazimierz Church (1689-95) and the Church of St. Anthony of Padua, Czerniak√≥w (1690-92). The traditional Orthodox church design in three parts, with a dome over each, was used in hundreds of Orthodox and Uniate wooden churches in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Of the many Polish Roman Catholic wooden domes built in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, examples with domes include the (1680-1690) and a church in Mnich√≥w built between 1765 and 1770. Tatar wooden mosques in Poland were domed central plan structures with adjacent minarets. =Papal States= Oval plan churches spread outside of Rome following Vignola's innovation with the church of Santa Anna dei Palafrenieri. Giovan Battista Aleotti built both in Argenta and San Carlo Borromeo in Ferrara between 1609 and 1621. The oval plans synthesize longitudinal and central plan church layouts, allowing clear views of the altar from all points. Francesco Borromini's dome of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1638‚Äì41) has a novel oval plan that approximates an ellipse using four circular arcs based on the vertices of two large equilateral triangles; a complex geometrical coffer pattern of crosses, octagons, and lozenges is repeated eight times on the dome's inner surface. Because the dome uses a pattern of coffers that get smaller as they approach the oculus and because it is lit from both above and below, the dome appears lighter and higher than it would otherwise. The church inaugurated the high baroque style in Rome. A copy based on plans provided by Borromini was built as the church of Madonna del Prato in Gubbio. Borromini's masterpiece is the dome of Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza (1642‚Äì50), built for Pope Urban at a University in Rome. The ribbed dome has a unique and complex geometry with a large window in each of it six lobes and stucco ornamentation. The style of using ribs in a dome over a coffered background was first expressed over the small chapel of Filippo Neri in the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella by Pietro da Cortona. The domes of Santi Luca e Martina and San Carlo al Corso, both about 14 meters wide, were also designed by Cortona. Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome. The oval plan church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale (1658‚Äì61) by Bernini is unusual in that the entrance is on the minor axis and it is often depicted as unique in this respect, but the later churches of Santi Celso e Giuliano (1735) and Santissimo Nome di Maria (1736) also have this layout. Bernini's Sant'Andrea al Quirinale is known as the oval Pantheon. Work on the Cathedral of Santa Margherita in Montefiascone, halted at the level of the drum due to lack of funds, was resumed after a 1670 fire destroyed the temporary wooden roof and damaged the interior. The stone dome was built by Carlo Fontana with eight ribs connected to each other by horizontal arches to resist outward force. It was completed in 1673 and he defended its proportions in print by both citing the measured proportions of other domes as well as the existing geometrical rules of proportion based on materials and supports. =Kingdom of France= In Paris, the dome of St. Marie de la Visitation was built by Fran√ßois Mansart from 1632 to 1633, who would later design the church of Val-de-Gr√¢ce (1645‚Äì1710), built to commemorate the birth of Louis XIV. The dome of Val-de-Gr√¢ce, however, was designed by Jacques Lemercier after having worked in Rome for seven years. It includes an inscription around the dome relating to the Bourbon kings. Inspired by St. Peter's Basilica, its dome likewise has two shells, but the outer shell is much taller in order to compensate for the foreshortening effect from viewing the exterior dome from nearby on the ground. The inner shell is made of stone and the outer shell is made of wood. Oval domes can also be found in secular buildings such as the Ch√¢teau de Maisons (1642‚Äì6) and the Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte (1657). In the Parisian church of Sainte-Anne- la-Royale (1662), Guarino Guarini, a Theatine monk and mathematician, used interlacing bands or ribs reminiscent of Islamic domes at Iznik or Cordoba, or the . =Kingdom of England= The church of St Stephen Walbrook in London was built by Christopher Wren from 1672 to 1677 and its dome has been called \\"the first classical dome in England\\". Eighteenth centuryKingdom of Great Britain= St. Paul's Cathedral in London London's Great Fire of 1666, following a devastating outbreak of plague in the city which killed a fifth of its population, spurred the commission of Christopher Wren to rebuild St. Paul's Cathedral, which occurred over the course of 35 years. Robert Hooke, who first articulated that a thin arch was comparable to an inverted hanging chain, may have advised Wren on how to achieve the crossing dome. Wren may also have been informed of the structural problems of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica by John Evelyn, who had examined it, and did not finalize his design for a dome three-quarters its size until shortly before its construction started in 1705. When finished, the dome had three layers: an inner dome with an oculus, a decorative outer wooden dome covered in lead roofing, and a structural brick cone in between. The brick cone ends in a small dome that supports the cupola and outer roof and the decorated underside of which can be seen through the inner dome's oculus. The structure rises 365 feet (108 m) to the cross at its summit, but is evocative of the much smaller Tempietto by Bramante. The use of the brick cone, in addition to other innovations, allowed the piers beneath the dome to be reduced in size. The thickness of the brick cone is 450 millimeters. The dome is supported by eight piers with a veneer of Portland stone over a core of rubble infill, which were damaged by the added pressure from the dome's construction and needed repairs in 1709. The dome was completed in 1710. Wren's structural system became the standard for large domes well into the 19th century. The iron chains used to encircle the 34-meter-wide dome have since been replaced by stainless steel girdles. Damage to the outer timber truss dome during World War II resulted in the timber being replaced by reinforced concrete. Although never very popular in domestic settings, domes were used in a number of 18th century homes built in the Neo- Classical style, including the 1720s Chiswick House, in West London. =Kingdom of France= Adjacent to a hospital and retirement home for injured war veterans, the royal chapel of Les Invalides in Paris, France, was begun in 1679 and completed in 1708. The dome was one of many inspired by that of St. Peter's Basilica and it is an outstanding example of French Baroque architecture. In 1861 the body of Napoleon Bonaparte was moved from St. Helena to the most prominent location under the dome. Plans for the Church of St. Genevieve, the patron saint of Paris, were approved in 1757 with a dome 275 feet tall over a Greek cross plan. The architect of the church, Jacques- Germain Soufflot, wanted to surpass the dome of London's St. Paul's Cathedral and, like St. Paul's, the dome consisted of three shells. Unlike St. Paul's, and due to advances in mathematics and engineering, all three shells were built of stone and made a part of a structural system that permitted support by thinner piers and walls. =Kingdom of Ireland= The Irish Parliament House in Dublin, designed by Edward Lovett Pearce and built from 1729 to 1739, included an octagonal dome over a central chamber for the House of Commons. The location of the space, especially relative to the barrel-vaulted House of Lords, which was off axis on the east side of the building, seemed to symbolize a political dominance by the House of Commons. The dome's outer shell was 31 feet above its inner shell and reminiscent of the Roman Pantheon and the octagonal dome over Lord Burlington's Chiswick House. The dome was the only exterior indication of the interior arrangement, but its location and height were such that it could not be easily seen. It was rebuilt after a fire in 1792 but demolished after the building was sold to the Bank of Ireland in 1803. =Holy Roman Empire= Karlskirche, Vienna Although the Thirty Years' War delayed the onset of the Baroque style in the areas of the Holy Roman Empire, rebuilding of the many palaces and churches destroyed had begun by the end of the seventeenth century. Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach studied architecture in Rome before working in Austria. His Church of the Holy Trinity (begun 1694) in Salzburg has clear influences from Borromini in its use of the color white, accentuated windows, and the elliptical dome and oculus. The oval dome of St. Peter's Church in Vienna (1702‚Äì33) is almost exactly the same, although it was designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The dome of von Erlach's Karlskirche (1716‚Äì24) is also very similar, but with round windows in the dome itself in addition to the windows of the drum and with dark trim at both the base of the drum and the base of the dome. Guarini's plan for the church of S. Maria Ettinga in Prague inspired a group of buildings built in Bohemia between 1698 and 1710. An abbey church at Obo≈ôi≈°tƒõ, Bohemia, with two transverse oval vaults in the nave intersecting a third circular dome made to look like an oval, was the first church by Christoph Dientzenhofer to show Guarini's influence. His vaulting system of two transverse oval vaults that do not overlap at the was elaborated two years later in the great abbey church at Banz (1710‚Äì18). Banz, overseen by Johann Dientzenhofer, has a complex arrangement of overlapping and subdivided transverse oval vaults with wide ribs at their intersections that make it difficult to understand the structural system, like Guarini's earlier church of Santa Maria della Divina Providenza in Lisbon. Domes by the Asam brothers, such as those of Weingarten Abbey (1715‚Äì20) and Weltenburg Abbey (1716-21), blended fresco painting, stucco and, in the case of Weltenburg, indirect lighting to achieve their effects. Another set of brothers, Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Dominikus Zimmermann of Bavaria, emphasized white stuccowork under direct lighting blended with fresco painting at at Steinhausen (1728‚Äì31) and Wieskirche at Weis (1745‚Äì54). In Bohemia and Moravia, Jan Santini Aichel blended styles in what has become known as baroque Gothic, as can be seen in his crossing dome at the at Kladruby (1712‚Äì26) and the five-lobed dome of the Chapel of St. Jan Nepomuk (1719‚Äì22). More conventionally baroque is his dome at in Rajhrad (1722‚Äì24). Appointed by the King of Savoy as First Architect to the King in 1714, Filippo Juvarra built the Basilica of Superga at Turin between 1717 and 1731. The apparent lightness of its dome may be attributed to both even lighting and the unusual lack of pendentives, with the dome on its circular entablature above eight columns instead. Its use of bulbous domes on the lantern and side towers was also unusual in Italy, where bulbous domes remained rare. The basilica was built as the official dynastic mausoleum of the House of Savoy, which had governed Piedmont and southeast France since the 15th century. The original intended site of the mausoleum, begun in 1596, was found to have problems with uneven settlement due to the soil and this led to a halt in construction. After efforts to compensate for the settlement, and despite the mausoleum at Superga already being built, construction was resumed to complete the original building as the Sanctuary of Vicoforte. Sanctuary of Vicoforte in Vicoforte, Italy. The Sanctuary of Vicoforte's oval dome, very close to an ellipse, was completed in 1731 and is the largest masonry dome of its kind in the world. It measures 37.15 meters by 24.8 meters at its base and is pierced by eight oval windows and a central oval oculus with a cupola. Although iron rings were used as part of the original construction at three levels to hold the dome together, cracks developed as the foundation settled further over the centuries. Additional reinforcement was added from 1985 to 1987 to halt their spread. Oval domes are also found in nearby Liguria, such as the church of San Torpete (1730‚Äì33) in Genoa, but the use of stone in this region, rather than the brick predominant in the architecture of Piedmont, limited their size. The style of Piedmont spread to Vienna, where Italian architects built oval-plan churches and inspired the building of others. Many decades after Guarino Guarini's buildings used them, the crossed-arch dome was revived by Bernardo Vittone in projects such as the Sanctuary of Valinotto (1738‚Äì39) and the Chapel of San Luigi Gonzaga. Vittone was familiar with Guarini's work and his dome over the in Chieri (1740-1744), the original of which had collapse in 1740, has been called \\"a lofty system of arches\\" due to the openings for light left in the pendentives and in the vaulting of adjacent bays. German Baroque architecture resolved the tension between longitudinal and centralized spaces through the use of ovals. Examples include the domes of Johann Michael Fischer's rotunda at Murnau (1725‚Äì27), Balthasar Neumann's Hofkirche at W√ºrzburg Residence (1733) and Hofkapelle at (1733), and Dominikus Zimmermann's church (1727‚Äì33). Neumann's more traditional longitudinal churches had domes over their crossings, such as his churches at M√ºnsterschwarzach Abbey (1727‚Äì43), (1730‚Äì39), (1733‚Äì45), (1742-45), and Neresheim Abbey (1745‚Äì92). Neumann replaced barrel vaults in basilical plan churches with series of light intersecting elliptical domes. Considered Neumann's masterpiece, his Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers (1743‚Äì72), uses a system of intersecting ovals similar to that at Banz Abbey. Unlike Banz, the bands at the intersection of the vaults are modeled in stucco, rather than being structural. The stone and mortar shells of the domed vaulting are reinforced by iron bars, a technique he also used in the 18 meter span domed vault covering the staircase at the W√ºrzburg Residence. It was built in a rural area of Bavaria as a pilgrimage church, as was the Wieskirche, and both in the rococo style. The two-shell dome of Saint Blaise Abbey in the Black Forest by French architect , with an internal span of 33.7 meters, dates from 1768 and rests on a ring of columns. It has been seen as a \\"landmark in the transition from Italian to French models in South German architecture\\" and may have been inspired by the Church of St. Genevieve, although the structural system was controversial. The 15.4 meter wide center of the inner dome dates is a thin membrane structure that dates from 1910-1913. =Hapsburg Monarchy= Because of the imprecision of oval domes in the Rococo period, resting them on drums created problems and the domes instead often rested directly on arches or pendentives. The oval dome of the Trinity church in Bratislava was built between 1717 and 1745. It is very similar to that of St. Peter's Church in Vienna, which the architect, Antonio Galli Bibiena, had briefly worked on, but is decorated instead by painting in the trompe-l'≈ìil technique for which the Bibiena family is known. The dome of Santa Maria Assumpta (c. 1770) in Sabbioneta, also designed by Bibiena, employs a more complex trompe-l'≈ìil effect. A double dome, the inner dome is an open latticework through which the outer dome can be seen, which is painted to appear to be a clear sky. Empress Maria Theresa commissioned the as part of a relocated crown-sponsored hospital in Vienna and it was built between 1755 and 1763. Its oval dome was decorated in the rococo style popular among the city's elites and it would serve as a model for the church built in the Nadelburg, which was founded by the Habsburgs. Johann Michael Fischer's abbey church at Rott am Inn (1759‚Äì63) has a series of three domical vaults over its nave, with the largest in the center over an octagonal space and painted with an illusionistic fresco by Matthias G√ºnther. The dome of the Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua, was added to the 15th century church by Filippo Juvarra between 1733 and 1765. The oval dome of the in Noto, Sicily, was built by Rosario Gagliardi and completed in 1753. It is a false dome 20.5 meters long and 13.2 meters wide and made of a series of parallel wooden arches hidden with planks and stucco on the inside surface. Unlike similar work elsewhere in Italy, it is self-supporting and unconnected to the earlier truss roof above it. The oval domes of the church of the Addolorata at Niscemi was based on designs by Gagliardi and the 1755 vault over the church of San Giuseppe in Syracuse by Carmelo Bonaiuto is also related. The dome over the crossing of four ribs springing from the centers of it supporting arches and is also a self-supporting false vault made of wood covered in plaster. =Spanish Empire= The Church of the Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s in Quito, Ecuador. Viceroyalty of Peru Quincha domes following the 17th century model of the Church of San Francesco in Lima were built in the capital and elsewhere, such as the dome over the imperial staircase of the Mercedarian main cloister that was rebuilt between 1759 and 1762. Other 18th century examples include the dome of the church of San Francisco in Trujillo (rebuilt after 1759) and the dome of the camar√≠n of the church of La Merced in Lima (1774). Viceroyalty of New Granada In Quito, Ecuador, La Iglesia de la Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s was built about 100 km away from an active fault line. The dome was built with adobe-concrete and tiles. Although the cruciform arrangement of the church allows it to withstand some horizontal force, the materials used were chosen for their resistance to compression only and the earthquakes it has experienced have required many repairs. =United States= Old State House in Dover, Delaware. In the United States, most public buildings in the late 18th century were only distinguishable from private residences because they featured cupolas, such as that of the Maryland State House or the smaller, and more typical, example over the Old State House of Delaware. Maryland State House in Annapolis was rebuilt in the 1770s with a pointed octagonal dome designed in 1772, the first over an American state house. The dome was covered with copper sheeting. Annapolis served as the capital of the country for ten months beginning in 1783, during which time George Washington resigned his military commission and Congress formally approved the Treaty of Paris, ending the American Revolutionary War. This dome, which leaked and was criticized as \\"inadequate, unimpressive, and too small for the building\\" and constructed \\"contrary to the rules of architecture\\", was replaced with the taller present design after 1784. The present dome was made of wood held together with wooden pegs and the exterior was completed by 1788; the interior was completed by 1797. The dome is similar to that of the Schlossturm in Karlsruhe, Germany. It is topped with an original lightning rod to Benjamin Franklin's design, supported by a surrounding copper and gold acorn and pedestal. The design for the national capitol building approved by George Washington included a dome modeled on the Pantheon but the design was subsequently revised and construction did not begin until 1822. Several states added prominent domes to their assembly buildings as a result of the choice for the national capitol, and completed them before the national capitol dome was finished. The Massachusetts State House, built in the decade after the Maryland State House dome, included a dome after it was decided that the national capitol building would have one. The dome is not visible from the interior of the building. The wooden exterior of the dome was initially painted white, then covered in canvas painted to resemble lead roofing with a gilded pinecone finial. The entire dome was later gilded. Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, begun in the 1770s, had the first dome to be built on an American home. The octagonal saucer dome with skylight oculus was built with curved wooden ribs made of four layers of short overlapping curved planks joined together with iron nails. Wooden purlins braced the ribs in two horizontal rings. The dome was completed after 1796. The inspiration for Jefferson's dome seems to have been the similar octagonal dome at Wrotham Park designed in 1754 by Isaac Ware, which has since been removed, rather than the octagonal dome at Chiswick House. Wrotham Park's dome was also positioned directly behind a portico, used round windows, and covered a space that did not extend down to the ground floor.

Typically, pendants are related thematically to each other and are displayed in close proximity. For example, pairs of portraits of married couples are very common as are symmetrically arranged statues to the sides of an altar. Pendants may be the creation of one artist alone or be the product of two artists and have, in that case, sometimes a competitive edge. The latter is borne out by the marble groups Triumph of Faith over Idolatry by Jean-Baptiste Th√©odon and Religion Overthrowing Heresy and Hatred by Pierre Le Gros the Younger on the Altar of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, 1695-97/98, in the Church of the Ges√π, Rome.

Frost later explained, \\"When I started in 1980 on the amphibian catalog, it had been a hundred years since this had been done. So it was an enormous amount of work to catch up because the number of amphibians had basically quadrupled.\\" In 1985, the first edition was published in print. Starting in 1990, Frost completely overhauled the catalog and now publishes it on the website of the American Museum of Natural History. The 1985 catalog had 4,014 species. By 2014, it had grown to more than 7,200, and was being updated almost daily. Amphibian Species of the World has been described as \\"the most significant single work in the history of amphibian biology.\\" Frost was awarded the 2013 Sabin Award for Amphibian Conservation in recognition of his work on the catalog. As of 2014, the website is visited more than a million times each year. Frost was lead author of a 2006 study that recommended major taxonomic changes to the amphibian tree of life based on a phylogenetic analysis of 522 species, making it the largest phylogenetic analysis of a vertebrate group to date.

It was first described in 1990 by Kirsten Cowley and remains a poorly known species. It resembles Melaleuca lateritia except for its hairy leaves and flower structures as well as its leaf shape and size. Description Melaleuca apostiba is a spreading shrub to with grey fissured bark and hairy young branches. The leaves are a dull green, flat, narrow-elliptic in shape, long, wide and hairy when they first appear. The leaves taper to a point, have distinct oil glands and three parallel veins. The flowers are red and arranged in spikes on the sides of the branches. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain up to 30 individual flowers. The outside of the floral cup is hairy and the stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 11 to 16 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs in June and July and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules.habit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca apostiba was first formally described in 1990 in a review of the genus by K.J. Cowley. The type specimen was recorded as having been collected in \\"Victoria Desert Region: Officer Basin\\" in 1963. A study of the records of the expedition indicate that the specimen was in fact collected east of Cosmo Newberry.

He is best known for inventing the railroad dome car in 1947. Born in Dayton, Ohio, Osborn served in World War I and graduated from the University of Cincinnati with an M.E. degree in 1921. Osborn then started as an apprentice with Dayton Engineering Laboratories (a division of General Motors).\\"Cyrus R. Osborn, 71, Ex-Official of G.M.\\" New York Times, Nov. 17, 1968, p. 86. He rose through the ranks to manage G.M.'s overseas division, and then became the second in command at G.M.'s Opel division in Germany in 1936. His leadership of Opel from 1937 to 1940 was marked by increasing controversy as tensions between the United States and Germany increased prior to the outbreak of World War II.Henry Ashby Turner, General Motors and the Nazis (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005). This is based on extensive correspondence with and about Hoffman in the records of Vauxhall Motors, VX 006466-850 Osborn was elected a vice president of the corporation in 1943. He retired from G.M. in 1962 after 45 years of service.  Experience in Nazi Germany  Although Osborn was senior executive at the plant, German law under Nazi power required firms to appoint a plant leader (Betriebsfuhrer). To mask US control of the plant, Rudolf A. Fleischer was awarded this position. Fleischer had previously been a treasurer of the plant and had fought for Germany in World War I. His Nazi-imposed post was not a part of Opel‚Äôs managerial structure. Fleischer consistently attempted to undermine Osborn‚Äôs leadership. The breaking point between the two was reached on April 20, 1938. Fleischer and Osborn had planned to present a new Opel model to Hitler on his birthday. Fleischer left Osborn behind and presented the car to Hitler by himself. In doing so Fleischer had given the US leadership of GM grounds for termination. To Osborn‚Äôs satisfaction, on May 25, 1938 Fleischer resigned from his position. Cyrus Osborn is credited with saving a Jewish man who was in a concentration camp. Willy Hoffman was employed in Opel‚Äôs R√ºsselsheim factory, until a questionnaire in which he stated he was Jewish, resulted in his termination. Upon learning of his plight, Osborn urged him to apply at GM‚Äôs British subsidiary Vauxhall Motors. Osborn explained the situation to a colleague at Vauxhall and promised Hoffman would be a good fit. After delays by British immigration restrictions and Hoffman‚Äôs one-month-long incarceration in a Nazi concentration camp, he, together with his wife and daughter, reached England in March 1939 to work at Vauxhall.

Ngorongoro Crater covers an area of 265 square kilometres and is thought to have been formed from the collapse of a volcanic mountain which had become inactive. Its rim lies some 2280 meters above sea level, while the floor is at 1800 meters. The diversity of landforms and altitude has produced similarly diverse habitats of mountains, gallery forests, craters, grassy plains, swamps, lakes and woodlands, ranging from arid and semi-arid communities below 1,300 m with abundant grazing to montane vegetation with tall grassland, open moors and relict evergreen montane forests on the steep slopes. There is a large stand of bamboo, Yushania alpina, on Oldeani (an extinct volcano of 3,188 meters) and Pencil Cedar, Juniperus procera, on Makarut Mountain. There are four extinct volcanic peaks, all over 3,000 meters, the highest of which is Loolmalasin (3,648 m). Within the crater lies Lake Magadi, a small soda lake. (Hillary Remen) The crater floor consists of shortgrass savanna punctuated by shallow, fresh and brackish lakes, marshes and swamps. Two notable forests are Lerai Forest and Laiyanai Forest, while the surrounds of Lake Eyasi are dominated by Acacia mellifera and Dalbergia melanoxylon during the dry season.http://www.ngorongorocrater.org/craters.html The lakes south of the crater are Lake Eyasi and Lake Manyara Trees, shrubs and lianes *Abutilon indicum (L.)

Chandigarh borders Naya Gaon on two sides.Nayagaon MC given last chance to remove encroachments  History  Naya Gaon was founded in Circa, in 1783, as a small settlement by the battle fatigued Sikh soldiers on the way to Sri Anandpur Sahib while coming from Delhi after the conquest of Delhi Sultanate by the Sikhs, as a large section of the Sikh forces had decided to celebrate 'Hola Mahala' at Anandpur Saheb. The first settlers on this land were the 'Dhillon' followed by the 'Sidhu','Nagra' and 'Mavi' Jatts and then the Bhramins. Other working classes were subsequently brought in by the initial settlers to help in their work. Naya Gaon remained a part of Manimajra Riasat till the independence of India. Then remained a part of District Ambala of joint Punjab. Large amounts of land belonging to Naya Gaon was acquired by the Govt. for the Chandigarh project. After the division of Punjab in 1965 it became a part of Ropar District. In the year 2006 a new district S.A.S. Nagar(Mohali) was formed and Naya Gaon became a part of Mohali district. In the 1980s people from all parts of northern India started settling in Naya Gaon due to affordable housing as compared to Chandigarh. Today it has become a conglomerate of people from states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttrakhand, U.P., Bihar, Bengal and North Eastern States.  Governance  Naya Gaon remained a gram panchayat till the year 2006, thereafter NAC(Notified Area Committee) Status was given and villages Nada, Karoran and Kansal were added to it.

He was the head of the first Survey Office established at Brisbane in 1844. Note, the separation of Queensland from New South Wales did not occur until 1859 and so the name Queensland was not used in Burnett's lifetime. Early life James Charles Burnett was born in North Britain (possibly Scotland), the son of William Burnett. He emigrated as a young child with his family to New South Wales where his father established Burnettland near Raymond Terrace in the Hunter River district. Surveying career In 1834 he entered the service of the Survey department of New South Wales, spending a considerable period in the Illawarra district. Burnett was selected by Sir Thomas Mitchell to lead a survey to trace the Great Dividing Range from south of Hanging Rock northward towards Moreton Bay. Burnett set off in October 1841 with Roderick Mitchell (son of Thomas Mitchell) as second-in-command of the party. After many difficulties, the range was traced to about the 30¬∞S and then the party headed for Brisbane arriving September 1842. In 1845, he was appointed a Commissioner of Crown Lands. Burnett subsequently undertook surveys of the Clarence River and Richmond River. In 1846, he was appointed in charge of the surveys in Moreton Bay and settled in Brisbane. In 1846 to 1847 he explored north of Moreton Bay in the area of the Mary River and Burnett River. His efforts in exploring Queensland (as it is now known) were recognised by New South Wales Governor Charles Augustus FitzRoy by naming the Burnett River and the surrounding area after Burnett. Later life Burnett died on 18 July 1854 aged 39 years at his home in Brisbane. For several months prior to his death, he had poor health, which was attributed to his \\"enthusiastic and almost reckless devotion to the trying duties of his profession\\". He had not left his home for several weeks prior to his death. He was buried in the Church of England section of the North Brisbane burial ground (now underneath the Lang Park stadium). Legacy A few days before Burnett's death, he received word that he had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. At the time of his death, it was proposed that a public subscription be established to create a lasting memorial to him, but this did not occur. However, in 1988, the Institution of Surveyors Australia erected a plaque honouring Burnett on the Wide Bay Highway, Ban Ban Springs () through which Burnett had passed in March 1847 while exploring the Burnett River district. Also, visual artist Natalie Billing used the rear of a building in Burnett Lane in Brisbane to create a tribute to Burnett (after whom the lane is named). Named in his honour Places names after Burnett include: ; New South Wales * Burnett County, New South Wales ; Queensland * Burnett Lane, Brisbane * Burnett River, which he discovered in 1847Reed, A.

It connects U.S. Route 75 (US-75) in the Kickapoo Nation Indian Reservation with K-7 southwest of Troy. Along the way K-20 intersects sever major highways including U.S. Route 159 in Horton and overlaps U.S. Route 73 from Horton to south of Everest. Northeast of Denton the highway intersects K-120, which travels north to Severance and Highland. K-20 travels through mostly rural farmlands and is a two-lane highway its entire length. Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails. K-20 overlaps the former Capitol Route near Horton. From Horton to south of Everest, the highway overlaps the former George Washington National Highway and King of Trails. The section from K-120 to Bendena overlaps the former Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway. K-20 was established between 1927 and 1930, and at that time ran from US-73E south of Everest east to K-16 south of Troy. By 1936, US-73E was renumbered to US-73 and K-16 was decommissioned and became an extension of K-7. On July 11, 1956, it was approved to extend K-20 from US-73 west to US-75 as soon as the county had improved the roadway. Then by August 1956, the county had finished required projects and it was officially extended. Route description K-20 begins at its western terminus at US-75 north of Holton on the border of the Kickapoo Indian Reservation. It travels east for about through mostly open pastures then intersects Dewberry Road. Past here, the landscape around the highway becomes more forested as it crosses an unnamed creek then intersects Falcon Road later. Here, the landscape transitions to mostly open pastures and continues east for then crosses Delaware River. It then passes through a group of houses and reaches Goldfinch Road, which travels north to Golden Eagle Casino. It continues east through rural grasslands and soon reaches an intersection with Hazelnut Drive, which marks the eastern border of the reservation. It continues for another past here then intersects Horned Owl Road, which travels north to Mercier. K-20 continues east through rural farmlands for then crosses Grasshopper Creek. The highway continues for another then enters Horton as 15th Street. It travels through the city for about then begins an overlap with US-73 and US-159. The three highways continue for then US-159 turns south, as K-20 and K-73 continue east. The two highways then pass Municipal Reservoir and cross Mission Creek, as the highway exits the city. The two routes continue east through open farmlands then cross Otter Creek about later. Another past the creek, K-20 turns north toward Everest as US-73 continues east. K-20 continues north for then enters Everest as 5th Street. The highway soon reaches Main Street, where it turns east and crosses a Union Pacific Railway track. The highway then exits the city after .25 then curves north at Racoon Road. The highway continues north for then curves back east. The highway continues through more open farmland for then crosses South Fork Wolf River. K-20 continues for about then enters into Doniphan County. About into the county, it intersects K-137 which travels south to Purcell. K-20 continues east for roughly then curves south for , then back east. It passes through rural farmlands for then curves north at Coronado Road and 115th Street. The highway continues north through flat rural farmlands with scattered areas of trees for then crosses North Branch Independence River. K-20 continues past here for then passes along the east border of Denton. The highway then curves east about later at a junction with 160th Road. It continues east for then intersects K-120, which travels north to Severance. K-20 then passes by school and continues for and reaches Bendena. The highway continues for another roughly through rural farmlands and reaches its eastern terminus at K-7 southwest of Troy. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 190 vehicles per day near slightly east of Purcell to 2910 vehicles per day slightly east of Horton along the overlap with US-73. K-20 is not included in the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-20 does connect to the National Highway System at its western terminus. HistoryEarly roads= Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. K-20 overlaps the former Capitol Route from Horned Owl Road to Horton. From Horton to south of Everest, the highway overlaps the former George Washington National Highway and King of Trails. The section from K-120 to Bendena overlaps the former Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway. =Establishment and realignments= K-20 was established between 1927 and 1930, and at that time ran from US-73E south of Everest east to K-16 south of Troy. Between 1933 and 1936, US-73E was renumbered to US-73 and K-16 was decommissioned and became an extension of K-7. This section was paved in 1948. In a July 11, 1956 meeting, it was approved to extend K-20 from US-73 west to US-75 as soon as the county had cleared brush and the ditches as well as fixing the slope of the roadway. Then by August 1956, the county had finished required projects and in an August 9, 1956 meeting, it was officially extended. On July 12, 1950, the section of K-20 from US-73 to the city of Everest was established as K-114. The commission authorized relocations of US-73 and K-20 in and around Everest through an August 12, 1964, resolution. The eastern end of K-20's concurrency with US-73 had been southeast of Everest. K-20 was relocated to pass through Everest and assume the course of K-114. This made its new US-73 junction at what was K-114's southern terminus. K-114 was replaced by K-20 when the relocations were completed in 1966.

Background Go Noi Island was located approximately 25 km south of Danang to the west of Highway 1, together with the area directly north of the island, nicknamed Dodge City by the Marines due to frequent ambushes and firefights there, it was a Vietcong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) stronghold and base area. While the island was relatively flat, the small hamlets on the island were linked by hedges and concealed paths providing a strong defensive network. Go Noi was the base for the VC R-20 and V-25 Battalions and, it was believed, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division. The operational plan called for four Marine infantry Companies to establish blocking positions along the railway tracks on Go Noi Island while an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) force swept east to west along Route 537 in the hope of pushing the PAVN/VC against the Marines and a southern blocking position established by the 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment in the Operation Wheeler/Wallowa area. Operation Following a preparatory air and artillery bombardment, at 09:04 on 28 December 1967 Marine helicopters started landing Company E, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines at Landing Zone Hawk (). The Marines were met with small arms fire coming from Bao An Dong village () west of the landing zone and as they advanced on the village they were hit by heavy fire and withdrew to allow for airstrikes on the village. Company I, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines and the command group arrived at the landing zone by 11:30, Company I quickly secured a nearby hamlet while Company E remained engaged at Bao An Dong suffering 5 killed and 9 wounded. Company I was then sent to support Company E but was stopped by VC hidden in the elephant grass. With both Companies pinned down air and artillery support was called in close to the Marine lines. At 15:30 Company M, 3/5 Marines was landed and sent forward to support Company E. At 18:00 under the cover of UH-1E gunship fire, Company E withdrew to join up with Company M and establish a night defensive position. 3rd Marine losses for the day were 19 dead and 25 wounded, 9 of the Marine dead had been left behind during the withdrawal, while the PAVN/VC had lost 32 killed. On the morning of 29 December Companies E and G 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines and the 5th Marine Regiment command group landed at LZ Hawk and the 5th Marines commander Colonel Robert D. Bohn assumed command of the operation from the 3/5 Marines commander, Lt. Col. Rockey. Company E followed by Company G advanced on Bao An Dong and after a brief skirmish with PAVN/VC defenders secured the village by midday, also recovering the bodies of the 9 Marines killed on the previous day. Two suspected VC were captured and an estimated 6 VC had been killed. On 30 December the ARVN concluded their sweep operation with minimal results but the operation was extended after intelligence was received that an enemy unit was located between LZ Hawk and the Liberty Bridge (). The operation was however reduced in size and operational command returned to Lt. Col. Rockey. By the afternoon of 3 March the Marines had swept 7 km west and were located near the Liberty Bridge having encountered minimal resistance. Aftermath Operation Auburn concluded at 17:25 on 3 January 1968, the Marines had suffered 23 dead and 60 wounded and the PAVN/VC 37 killed. The majority of the Marine losses took place during the engagement on 28 December. The Marines would return to Go Noi during Operation Jasper Square and Operation Allen Brook.

It has papery bark and small heads of white flowers in summer. Description Melaleuca arcana grows to a height of and has whitish, papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, broadly egg-shaped with a blunt tip and with 5 to 11 parallel veins. The flowers are white or cream, sometimes pinkish and arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter and contain between 5 and 11 groups of flowers in threes. The stamens are arranged in 5 bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 6 to 9 stamens. Flowering occurs unpredictably throughout the year and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, arranged in cylindrical spikes. The seeds are released within a year when the fruits are mature. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1968 by Stanley Thatcher Blake from a specimen collected north-west of Cooktown and west of Cape Bedford in Three Islands National Park. The specific epithet (arcana) is from the Latin arcanus, meaning \\"secret\\" or \\"mysterious\\" in reference to the species' apparent rarity. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca incana occurs on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula in the swales between sand dunes. Conservation status This melaleuca has the status \\"of least concern\\" in the Government of Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992. UsesAgroforestry= This species is useful for sand stabilisation in coastal areas and it is a good source of honey. =Timber= The wood can be used for posts and railway ties. =Horticulture= In some situations this species may be preferable to Melaleuca leucadendron as a street tree because of its smaller size at maturity.

In the summer of 2015, the channel, led by Levant, launched a campaign to boycott Tim Hortons, a chain of Canadian coffee shops, after it rejected in-store ads from Enbridge due to complaints from customers opposed to the oil pipeline projects being promoted by the ads. \\\\- In early 2016, the Alberta government banned The Rebel Media's correspondents from press briefings on the grounds that, because Ezra Levant had testified in court in 2014 that he was a columnist or commentator rather than a reporter, none of his current correspondents could be considered to be journalists. On 17 February 2016, the government admitted that it made a mistake and said that it would allow The Rebel Media correspondents into press briefings.

In February 2019, after suing the Southern Poverty Law Center for allegedly damaging his reputation and career prospect by characterizing the Proud Boys as a hate group, McInnes announced that he had once again been hired by the media group. British contributor Caolan Robertson no longer works for the Rebel. Robertson claims he was fired for \\"knowing too much\\" about the Rebel's finances, claiming the company dishonestly solicited donations for projects that were already funded and concealing how that money was spent. He also claimed that Southern was fired for refusing to tape a fundraising appeal for the Rebel's Israel trip after fundraising targets had already been met. Robertson also played audio of Levant offering him thousands of dollars of what Levant himself called \\"hush money\\". Levant denies these allegations and says he will present evidence opposing this in court, claiming that he was being \\"blackmailed\\" by Robertson and his partner. Levant has since briefly talked about The Rebel's finances in his online show and released a summary on The Rebel's website. It was reported that person that negotiated the settlement is the former director of communication for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Kory Teneycke. = Boycott by the Conservative Party of Canada = During the 2017 Conservative Party leadership race, many contenders, including the eventual leadership winner Andrew Scheer, gave interviews to the outlet. After the 2017 Conservative Party leadership race, it was revealed that Scheer's campaign manager Hamish Marshall's IT firm Torch provided IT services to The Rebel Media. In 2015, Marshall told the National Observer, that he was only involved in the business side of the Rebel. Marshall explained to that he had left the Rebel after the leadership race ended to avoid a conflict of interest. In September 2017 Marshall's name was removed from the list of directors of The Rebel Media on the federal government's online registry of corporate information. On 16 October 2017, The Globe and Mail asked Scheer if he knew that Hamish Marshall shared office space with the Rebel during the leadership campaign. Scheer replied that he did not ask Marshall about his firm's many clients. Later, a spokesperson clarified that Scheer did not know the specifics of the arrangement. Levant explained that Marshall's IT firm Torch provided client services for the Rebel. A 2017 National Post article argued that Marshall implemented the Rebel donation system. Scheer told Maclean's in 2018, that Marshall past relationship with the Rebel should not be conflated with his selection as campaign chair. Scheer denounced the outlet due to its coverage of the Unite the Right rally, and stated that he would stop doing interviews with The Rebel Media until its ‚Äúeditorial directions\\" changed. A day later, Scheer stated that he would not be granting interviews with the Rebel going forward, in an interview with the National Post. = Advertiser boycott = Beginning in May 2017, the Rebel was the target of a boycott campaign by the social media activist group Sleeping Giants whereby advertisers were pressured to withdraw their adverts from The Rebel Media's YouTube channel and website. Within a three-month period in 2017, the activist group claimed that the Rebel had lost approximately 300 advertisers, including CCM Hockey, Mountain Equipment Co-op, Red Lobster, Reitmans, Penguin Books Canada, Volkswagen Canada and Tangerine Bank, along with PetSmart, the Hudson's Bay Company, General Motors Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint, the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation, Ottawa Tourism, Porter Airlines, and Whistler Blackcomb ski resort. The City of Edmonton withdrew from city advertisements after complaints on social media about the controversial nature of Levant's comments. According to Councilor Oshry, the city would have made this decision regardless of political leanings, because of controversial articles.Mosleh, O. \\"Edmonton pulls online ads from right wing Rebel Media after social media backlash\\" , 660 News, 7 June 2017. Retrieved 7 June 2017. Another activist group, Hope not Hate, pressured Norwegian Cruise Lines into cancelling a scheduled Caribbean cruise which was to feature talks by The Rebel Media personalities, many of whom have since left the media website. = Rebel Freedom Fund = In December 2017 Wells Asset Management announced the Rebel Freedom Fund, allowing investors to fund Levant's film and video projects, offering an expected 4.5% return. This attracted news coverage the following February in advance of the fund's ostensible 1 March opening date, generally negative; MoneySense, for example, stated that \\"This one carries a lot of risk and doesn‚Äôt clear the MoneySense bar for appropriate retirement investment risk, whatever the political orientation.\\" In June, however, Wells announced that it was shutting down all its funds, and when queried by a reporter from Maclean's, stated that the Rebel Freedom Fund had never launched.

It was in the area now known as the suburbs of Milton and Paddington. It was also known as North Brisbane Cemetery, Paddington Cemetery and Milton Cemetery. Geography The burial ground was located across four blocks bounded by Beatrice Street on the north, Hale Street on the east, Church Street on the south and the present-day Castlemain Street on the west. This land is now used as Lang Park stadium and Ithaca Swimming Pool and children's parkland. Maps showing the burial ground and its later reuse are published by the Brisbane City Council. History Paddington Cemetery, 1917, now underneath Lang Park/Suncorp Stadium The First Brisbane Burial Ground was established in 1825 when Brisbane was established as the Moreton Bay penal colony at present-day Skew Street (near the William Jolly Bridge northern endpoint). It was in use until 1843 when the North Brisbane Burial Ground opened. The North Brisbane burial ground was in use from 1843 to 1875, during which time up to 10,000 people may have been buried there. After 1875, the burial ground was closed and new burials were to take place in the newly established Toowong Cemetery. Circa 1862 the Anglican Church established a mortuary chapel for the cemetery. It was demolished in 1891. The cemetery was flooded during the 1893 Brisbane flood. Memorial reserve, Christ Church, Milton, 2005 In 1907, the Ithaca Shire Council began to plan to convert the cemetery, by then a community eyesore, into a recreational reserve. However, the council did not control the land, as individual religious denominations continued to have control of their burial ground area. By the 1910s, relatives were offered the opportunity to exhume and reinter deceased family members or to relocate their headstone or other monumental masonry. The first removals took place in 1913. Over 500 headstones were removed into a memorial reserve, a small section of the Anglican section of the cemetery, adjacent to Christ Church. In 1914, it was developed as an athletics field called Lang Park and progressively redeveloped into Brisbane's major sporting stadium, Suncorp Stadium. During the Depression many of the headstones in the memorial reserve were removed or destroyed. In 2001, the development of Hale Street into a major traffic route resulted in the resumption of some of the memorial reserve and the remaining headstones were reorganised into an even smaller memorial park behind Christ Church (and are only accessible via the churchyard). The further development of Suncorp Stadium visually encroaches on the memorial park, its high blue glass walls reflecting blue light into the memorial reserve. Operation The North Brisbane burial ground was not a single cemetery, but rather a collection of cemeteries operated by different religious denominations.

Four were passed to West Coast Railway in 1994. Others were sold to SteamRanger. Today many are owned by Steamrail Victoria.Carriages Steamrail Some sources list the twenty-three 800, 850 and 860 class carriages as part of this fleet, but those are covered on the suburban trailers page. History During the 1930s, the South Australian Railways were undergoing a massive quality increase under Commissioner Webb. After addressing the serious deficiencies in locomotives and freight rolling stock, Webb turned his attention to the quality of passenger accommodation on longer runs around the state. To address these failings, a new fleet of steel passenger carriages were constructed at Islington Railway Workshops, with the first entering service in 1936. ServicesDesign The first 12 cars were of a similar external design; first class carriages were numbered 500 through 503, and second class carriages 600 to 607, in keeping with Webb's preference for numeric over alphabetic categorisation. All cars were painted green with a cream band along the windows, and black for the undergear and roofs. Bogies were fitted with plain bearings, to accelerate construction and reduce costs. The cars were fitted with folding stairs at the four corners, to provide platform-level and ground-level access. All twelve were end-vestibule compartment-type carriages; the first class cars had room for 42 passengers across seven compartments, and the second class carriages sat 64 in 8 compartments. Each compartment was accessed by twin wooden sliding doors, with etched glass panels fitted. Toilets and were provided at the vestibules. The interior of each car was fitted with polished timber panels, chrome fittings and drop-down windows; and the first-class carriages had mirrors between compartments, and arm rests between each seat. The cars experienced a very positive public reaction, and so construction continued with a new series of saloon carriages. These would become the 700, 750 and 780 class cars, with modified window spacings and slightly shorter bodies. These cars had a central aisle with seats either side and toilets in the centre (dividing the smoking and non-smoking sections). Cars 700-715 were exclusively second class, for 56 passengers across 14 bays of four seats; 750-753 were composite first (22) and second (24); and 780-783 were exclusively first class, with two seats on one side of the aisle and four on the other, for a total capacity of 38 passengers. In the 1940s, several of the 700 class cars were fitted with carpet and higher quality seating, to match the standards of first class vehicles. The drop-down windows eventually presented maintenance problems, so they were replaced with half-drop windows instead; the lower half of the window was fixed in place. The cars were eventually repainted to maroon and silver in the late 1960s, to match the scheme of the newer air conditioned vehicles in use on the Overland and other trains. Details500 class600 class700 class750 class780 class= In 1973, car 783 was converted to a \\"departmental car\\". This involved stripping the interior, and fitting a kitchen and sleeping compartments for up to eight people, as support for the ViceRegal car and Commissioner's Car Murray. The car was fitted with a 3-phase power supply, and this was used when the vehicle was included in the Commissioners' Train. As rebuilt, the car was painted red and allocated the code DC783. No airconditioning was fitted; the bogies had come from the Cafeteria Car, which had been shifted across to Commonwealth style bogies. It was a common sight on broad gauge passenger trains to Port Pirie circa 1978, when it provided head-end power for an RBJ buffet car while the Cafeteria Car was unavailable. When the South Australian Railways was sold to the Commonwealth in 1975 (to become Australian National Railways, later Australian National), the vehicle was retained by the South Australian State Government. It was officially withdrawn in 1986, then leased to SteamRanger and named Lowanna in 1990. In 1995 the car was transferred to become a static exhibit at the Port Dock Railway Museum, and ten years later it was sold privately to a Victorian individual, who placed the car under the care of the Victorian Goldfields Railway in Maldon. ConstructionIn ServiceSouth Australian Railways (1936-1975)= When the cars first entered service they were used on fixed consists for specific rosters. As the fleet grew they replaced many of the older vehicles, which were progressively scrapped or held for occasional use, like the Centenary Train. Through the 1960s, the carriages had their windows replaced, and the exteriors were repainted from the green/cream/black scheme to the newer red/silver scheme, to match the livery applied to the newer air conditioned fleet and diesel locomotives. In 1962 car 705 caught fire, and the following year it was condemned, written off and scrapped. Standard Gauge use (1968-1974) In December 1968 four compartment carriages were converted to standard gauge, for use on the first runs between Peterborough and Broken Hill. The cars were 500, 501, 600 and 601, and these were included in the first passenger run on the new line, on 16 January 1969. 600 returned to broad gauge in 1972, and the other three in 1974, as they were superseded by other stock. =Australian National (1975-1997)= The South Australian Railways was sold to the Australian federal government in 1975, and most of the rolling stock was included in that transfer. DC783 ex No.783 was retained by the State for special occasions; with 705 scrapped, that left 34 broad gauge carriages to be transferred. Standard Gauge use (1977-1991) In July 1977, three cars were transferred across to standard gauge for fast, mixed goods services. Cars 780, 781 and 782 became BF cars 343, 344 and 345 respectively. The BF code was defined as \\"non-airconditioned economy class sitting car with cooking facilities\\". It is not clear where any such cooking facilities may have been constructed, but they may have taken over the space previously allocated to the short (3-window) saloon. The cars were repainted into red with a tan roof, black undergear and silver stripes to match the scheme of the short-haul Commonwealth Railways passenger stock. In November of the same year, 750 was transferred to standard gauge as BE346, a regular economy-class sitting carriage. It was followed in 1979 by 752 as BE351 and 1980 by 753 as BE352 and 751 as BE358. In 1983 two cars were burnt; BE352 had one end destroyed on 13 August, so it was written off. BF344's interior was obliterated a few months later, such that the car shell was tipped off the track to recover only the bogies. Both were last noted at Stirling North in early 1988. In 1990 cars BF343, BE346, BE351 and BE358 were stored at Port Pirie, leaving BF345 as the only class member still in service with Australian National. It was written off in November 1992, but instead of scrapping the vehicle was seconded to Islington Railway Workshops for refurbishment as an additional vehicle for The Explorer. V/Line (1983-1992) When V/Line introduced their New Deal in 1981, the intention was to provide an all-steel, all-airconditioned fleet of carriages and to abolish the use of older, timber-bodied cars. The fleet was not quite sufficient to achieve this goal immediately, and so while the Harris carriages were undergoing refurbishment, V/Line agreed to hire some carriages from Australian National, from 8 March 1983. The cars initially transferred were 702, 703 and 715. During the repaint and restoration, car 715 was found to have significant rust problems, and so it was returned in May 1983. In its place, Australian National sent over 500, on 16 September 1983, and 600, on 30 September 1983. The cars were refurbished and painted in the older Victorian Railways scheme of blue with gold stripes, to avoid the implication that the vehicles were of the same quality as newer, air-conditioned stock. They were used as a fixed consist on runs that would later be handed over to H sets. While in V/Line service they were classed BK1 and BK2, AK1 and BKL3, ex 702, 703, 500 and 600 respectively. BK1 was the first to enter service on 3 June 1983, followed by BK2 on 13 August 1983, AK1 on 17 October 1983 and BKL3 on 14 December 1983.Newsrail February 1986 p57Bray, Vincent & Gregory, Steel & Special Coaching Stock of Victoria, 2009, , p.103 Circa 1986, 1AK was reclassed as Economy in place of First Class, to better match with the short- haul H type rosters. It is not known if the capacity of the car was increased from 42 to 56 by replacing seats, but that is unlikely. In 1991 2BK had one of its toilet compartments converted to a conductor office area, eliminating the need for a guard's van to be included in the consist. During the V/Line era, car 607 was sold privately, refurbished, painted blue and gold and reclassed 1BH. It was offered to V/Line for use on regular services but deemed unnecessary, and in 1987 it was restored to its previous identity. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" !Code !Set No. !From !To !Car F !Car E !Car D !Car C !Car B !Car A (East end) !Capacity !Weight !Length !Changes to achieve !Notes - style=\\"background: #002466; color: #FFFF00\\" K No number 1983-08-03 1991-04-16   1BK (?) 2BK (?) 3BKL (?) 1AK 218 154t 82m  Order of cars uncertain. - style=\\"background: #002466; color: #FFFF00\\" K No number 1991-04-17 1992-07-13   2BK 1BK (?) 3BKL (?) 1AK 218 154t 82m 2BK fitted with conductor compartment. Order of middle cars uncertain. } The Explorer (1993) The four V/Line cars were returned to Australian National on 13 July 1992, and placed into storage. After a short period they were refurbished and repainted into a blue, yellow and white scheme for a new tourist train called The Explorer, but the project was soon abandoned and the cars were returned to indefinite storage. Cars BE358 (ex 751) and BF345 (ex 782) were to be included in the project, but the refurbishment had not started when it became clear that the project was short- lived. Disposal In 1981 most of Australian National's fleet of non- airconditioned vehicles was sold off. Cars 503, 602, 606, 701, 704, 706, 710 and 712 were purchased by SteamRanger and restored for use on their line. Cars 501, 502, 601, 603, 604, 605, 607, 700, 707, 708, 709, 711, 713 and 714 were purchased by SteamAge and transferred to Victoria, with the intent to operate mainline tours behind locomotive R766. The three standard gauge vehicles remaining, BF343 (ex 780), BE346 (ex 750) and BE351 (ex 752), were railed from Port Pirie to Murwillumbah in 1991, following a sale from Australian National to the Northern Rivers Railroad. Cars 500, 600, 702, 703, 751 and 782 were retained by Australian National up its sale of stock to Great Southern Rail in 1997. =Great Southern Railway= The breakup and sale of Australian National from 1992 finally caught up with the fleet, and on 1 November 1997 the remaining six vehicles - 500, 600, 702, 703, 751 and 782 - were included in the sale of rollingstock to Great Southern Rail. The company had very little use for 60-year-old, non-airconditioned stock, and so they were on-sold in June 1998 to Steamrail Victoria. The cars were transferred on standard gauge bogies to Melbourne. In PreservationSteamranger= Cars 503, 602, 606, 701, 704, 706, 710 and 712 were purchased by SteamRanger in 1981 and restored for use on their line. 602 was modified during the restoration, becoming a 24-seat tavern/refreshhment car, with a brake and guard compartment at one end. In the new form it was named Bowmans, and it entered service in 1983. Car 715 was owned by SteamRanger for a short period up to 1999, when it was onsold to Steve Moritz for his Murraylander project. Murraylander In 2000 two of the cars, 606 and 712, were sold by SteamRanger to Steve Moritz following his purchase of 715. 606 was purchased by the Port Dock Railway Museum at the end of 2000 and delivered in 2001; expressions of interest were sought by the Australian Locomotive and Railway Carriage Co for sale of 712 and 715 in 2010. Around the same time, ALRCCo organised the sale and transfer of car 714 from Steamrail to Tailem Bend. =SteamAge Australia= In 1981 SteamAge Australia purchased fourteen of the carriages, and these were railed from Adelaide to Melbourne departing 3 December 1981 as a single consist. The cars were planned to be refurbished and named after Victorian lakes. The inaugural run of the Melbourne Limited fleet, with some of the newly refurbished carriages, was on Saturday 15 June 1986 to Swan Hill. Cars 501, 502, 601, 604, 604, 605, 607, 700, 707, 708, 709, 711, 713 and 714 were included in the purchase. Within a few years most had been restored for service; they became Weeroona (ex 501), Burrumbeet (ex 502), Lauriston (ex 603), Corangamite (ex 604), Wendouree (ex 605), Johnnie Walker (club car ex 707), and Eppalock (power car ex 713). All cars had been restored to variant of the South Australian Railways' original green with cream livery. 607 had been onsold privately and restored as 1BH in Victorian Railways blue and gold, and offered to V/Line for their use; the offer was knocked back, and the car is only thought to have run in a few enthusiast specials. At various points the fleet had been paired with CP vans 24, 30 and 35. In 1987 SteamAge collapsed, and the vehicles were sold to Australian Vintage Travel. Australian Vintage Travel When SteamAge collapsed in 1987 the fleet was sold to Australian Vintage Travel and converted to standard gauge, for a service called The Southern Cross Express. 607/BH1 was included in the sale, and it along with the seven restored cars were converted across to standard gauge. They were joined by Wedgewood, a dining car converted from 602, and the first run of this consist was to Seymour on Friday 11 December 1987, followed with a promotional tour to Canberra on Friday 22nd to Sunday 24 January 1988. The company went into receivership in July 1988, and all the vehicles were put out to tender. Cars 501 and 707 were sold privately; the remaining standard gauge cars were sold to the Northern Rivers Scenic Railway in New South Wales, along with 708 which had been partway through conversion to a second club car (to be named Wellington), and the uncompleted 700, 709, 711 and 714 were left in storage at Steamrail's compound in Newport, Victoria. Northern Rivers Scenic Railway The NRSR intended to use the cars for services in northern New South Wales on the Murwillumbah line. On 29 December 1989 the eight cars already on standard gauge were transferred to Goulburn roundhouse as a temporary staging point before later being shifted further north. In 1991 they were joined by the three cars which had been stored at Port Pirie - 750, 752 and 780. In 1999 the complete ex-SteamAge Northern Rivers fleet entered service as their Ritz Rail train, with sitting cars Oxley (ex 502), Clarence (ex 603), Wilsons (ex 604), Brunswick (ex 605), dining cars Tweed (ex 601) and Richmond (ex 607), club car Cape Byron (ex 708) and Power Car (ex 713). It appears that cars 750, 752 and 780 may not have re-entered service at the time, and their whereabouts following the sale of the rest of the fleet is unknown. In May 2004 the Ritz Rail train was transferred from Murwillumbah to Lithgow for long-term storage, and in 2010 the fleet was shifted to Parkes for a stock auction. West Coast Railway In 1994 West Coast Railway acquired the remaining four cars from Newport - 700, 709, 711 and 714. These were transferred to Ballarat Workshops for restoration, and within a few years three of them had re-entered service as excursion class vehicles. 709 was kept at Ballarat as a source of spare parts. When the company folded the four vehicles were sold to Steamrail. While in West Coast Railways service they used the code BK, following on from V/Line's use of that code for 702 and 703 in the period 1983-1992. Private sales When Australian Vintage Travel folded, two of their vehicles were sold privately. Weeroona, previously car 501, was sold in 1989 and re-entered service in 1993 with an end deck, kitchen and dining facilities, and only three compartments retained. It was named Terra Australis and coded TA501. By 1994 the vehicle had been repainted into blue with gold stripes and a white roof, with the new identity Terror Australis. The other private sale was car 707, which had been a club car named Waterford under Australian Vintage Travel, and previously the Johnnie Walker Club Car under SteamAge. By 1992 it had been rebuilt as an observation car at Thirlmere in New South Wales, and coded ABM707. Since then it has been renamed Crux Australis. Current whereabouts of both cars are unknown. =Steamrail Victoria= In 1998, Steamrail acquired the first six members of their ex- South Australian Railways fleet, with cars 500, 600, 702, 703, 751 and 782 purchased from Great Southern Rail and railed from Adelaide to Melbourne, then converted to broad gauge and moved to Newport Workshops. The cars were reclassed as AK500, BKL600, BK702, BK703, AK751 and ABK782; the latter two were unusual, as 751 had previously been a composite carriage and 782 exclusively first class. AK500, BK600 (no longer BKL) and BK702 were repainted into blue with gold; BK703 was retained in The Explorer livery, and the other two are not listed on the Steamrail website. In 2004 Steamrail purchased the four carriages previously owned by West Coast Railway - BK700, BK709, BK711 and BK714. BK700 had been repainted to Victorian Railways blue by 2005, BK711 retained in West Coast Railway scheme, and the other two are not listed. In August 2010 expressions of interest were sought for the sale of BK714, which has since been moved to Tailem Bend. Finally in 2010 the remnants of the Ritz Rail fleet were sold off. An auction initially saw many cars passed in, but Steamrail purchased dining cars Tweed (ex 601) and Richmond (ex 607) along with van CP24. After the sale, CP24 was swapped for sitting car Oxley (ex 502). At the same time, the power car was purchased by a private individual with connections to Steamrail. Of the new acquisitions, Oxley, Tweed, Richmond and Power Car were railed to Islington railway Workshops for refurbishment in 2012, and emerged in a variant of Victorian Railways blue and gold with white roofs to distinguish them from the broad gauge stock. The cars were allocated codes, respectively AK502, DCK601, DCK607 and PCK713. There were stored for a time at Seymour in the SRHC compound, before being used on their first tour at the start of 2016, connecting with a broad gauge train at Ararat. 603, 604 and 605 were last seen stored around the Dimboola turntable; at some point previously, 605 had been fitted with marker lights. =707 Operations= Sale railway station as preserved by 707 Operations. At the sale of the Ritz Rail stock, car 708 was purchased by a private individual with connections to 707 Operations. The car has since been classed LCK. =Victorian Goldfields Railway= Car DC783 was acquired privately and restored to service on the Victorian Goldfields Railway in 2005, named Lowanna. It is permitted on the V/Line network, but a note in the network service plan addenda says that it \\"requires a clearance assessment prior to each path approval on V/Line Network. Only allowed on the V/Line Network with steps removed.\\"https://corporate.vline.com.au/getattachment/16cd1a7a-2973-4631-80fc-b6218b9ef990/Addenda =Espee Rail Services= As at 17 October 2016, Espee Rail Services was authorised to operate standard gauge trains in Victoria, using the passenger cars AK500 and 502, BK 600, 603, 604, 605, 700, 702, 703, 711, 712, 714 and 715, dining cars DCK 601 and 607, lounge car LCK708, power van PCK713 and supply vans CP24, 30 and 35. However, there is no evidence that cars 500, 600, 607, 700, 702, 708 and CP35 have been placed on standard gauge. Model railwaysHO Scale= A number of resin kits have been made available over recent decades, and these occasionally appear on eBay and similar sites. In 2017 Trainbuilder announced a planned production of the group of cars, modelled in brass, retailing at $475 individually of $1900 for a set of four. Red and silver cars will include 500, 501, 601, 607, 707, 712, 753 and 780, along with a four-pack of 502, 603, 700 and 702. The SteamRanger preserved green & cream set will consist of 503, 602, 701 and 704, and the individual cars 502, 606, 706 and 710. Cars in blue and gold are AK1, BK1, BKL2 & BKL3, both as a set and individually; and all three West Coast Railways vehicles, 700, 711 and 714, are being released individually.

Biography Charles Frederick Gale was born on 26 November 1860 at Geraldton, Western Australia, the son of William Gale, merchant and collector of customs, and his wife Mary Ann (n√©e Scott). He was educated at Bedford Modern School in England and Hale School in Perth. Gale was ‚Äòa squatter in the Gascoyne district in the early 1880s, but was ruined by drought and went prospecting‚Äô. From 1893 he was Assistant Inspector of Stock at Geraldton and from 1897 Inspector of Pearl-Shell Fisheries at Shark Bay. Two years later ‚Äòhe became Chief Inspector of Fisheries at Perth and in 1906 gave the joint select committee on the fishing industry valuable information on the western fishing grounds, gathered while leading a trawling expedition in 1904‚Äô. From 1908, after an amalgamation, Gale was also chief protector of Aboriginals. His first report recommended the establishment of reserve stations which the natives of each tribal district 'could look upon as a home'. Gale suggested that this could be done splitting up some of the large pastoral holdings. He anticipated the 'strong opposition and protestation' of the squatters, but during his term, Moola Bulla, the first Aboriginal cattle-station, was begun. In 1909 he also persuaded pastoralists to ration free of charge Aboriginal indigents on their properties, by pointing out that they were, after all, 'born in the country from which in many instances large profits are yearly made'. On 22 July 1914, in Melbourne, he married a widow, Flora Marie Farquhar (n√©e Blackman). He then took long service leave in Japan. After ‚Äòresuming work in February 1915, he was retrenched in March, owing to the re-organisation of certain departments'. This was probably due ‚Äòless to differences over policy than to a clash of personalities‚Äô. R. H. Underwood, the minister, held a low opinion of Gale's 'ability and energy'. The dismissal upset public servants and a select committee of inquiry was appointed on the motion of Gale's friend, Sir Walter Kingsmill. All witnesses attested that Gale's work had been satisfactory and the committee reported that his dismissal was 'illegal'; it recommended reinstatement. This was not done and further intimidatory measures forced him to accept retrenchment. In 1917-19 he was secretary of the Civil Service Club. Gale was also a committee member of the Western Australian Turf Club and a JP. Childless and survived by his wife, he died of pneumonia, in the Armadale hospital on 24 September 1928.

After NASSCO applied for a $62.3 million loan from the United States Export- Import Bank (Eximbank) to fund projects, the latter suggested a transfer of the facilities‚Äô management to the private sector. The company was sold in 1963 to Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, Inc. of the Jacinto family. In 1974, NASSCO assets were absorbed by newly incorporated National Steel Corporation. NSC was later acquired by Wing Tiek of the Malaysian Westmont Group in 1995. NSC was severely affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In 2000, the government ordered for NSC‚Äôs liquidation.

Twenty titles were affected by the returns, to the serious detriment to the finances of Up Publications; many of the titles returned were not politically themed. The publisher was allegedly told by a bookshop source that its stance in the 2014 occupation and its publishing of books supportive of the Umbrella Movement were responsible. Although no reason was given for the returns, two of the delisted books about the occupation were strong sellers at independent bookshops. Students staged a \\"read-in\\" of delisted books outside the Commercial Press on the campus of the Chinese University to draw attention to the marginalisation of independent books, and urging the public to independent booksellers in the city instead of subsidiaries of Sino.

In 2011 Addison was honored as one of the Library of Virginia's \\"Virginia Women in History\\" for her contributions to education. Personal life Addison was born on December 8, 1861 in Upperville, Virginia to Charles Addison and Elizabeth Anderson Addison, both of whom were slaves. She was the third child born to the couple and the second daughter. After her family was emancipated Lucy's father purchased farm land in Fauquier County and Addison began attending school. She later traveled to Philadelphia to attend the Institute for Colored Youth, and graduated with a teaching degree in 1882. Addison kept her skills current by attending continuing education classes at schools, including Howard University and the University of Pennsylvania. She later served in several supervisory positions, including as a member of the board of trustees for the Burrell Memorial Hospital. Education work Shortly after receiving her degree, Addison returned to Virginia and began teaching in Loudoun County, Virginia. In 1886, she moved to Roanoke, Virginia to teach at the First Ward Colored School. The following year Addison began serving as an interim head following the death of the school's principal. She continued as such until 1888, when a new school was built and a male principal hired. Addison then served for more than a decade as both a teacher and an assistant principal for the school. In 1917 Addison was hired to serve as the principal for the Harrison School, a school for African-Americans. Although the school was only accredited to teach up to the eighth grade, Addison expanded the curriculum to include high school level classes while also continually lobbying Virginia State Board of Education for full accreditation. Her work came to fruition in 1924, when the Board granted the school full accreditation and the school graduated several students with a high school diploma. Addison retired in 1927 and moved to Washington, D.C. to live with one of her sisters, but returned to Virginia for several occasions, including the naming of Roanoke's first public high school for African Americans in her honor. Death and legacy Addison suffered from chronic nephritis and died in Washington, D.C. on November 13, 1937. She was buried in Columbian Harmony Cemetery. In 1970 her remains were re-interred when the cemetery was moved to Maryland to become part of National Harmony Memorial Park. Roanoke opened the Lucy Addison High School the year after Addison retired, and she traveled to Virginia to attend the opening ceremony. In the 1970s the school was almost closed and turned into a vocational school, as Roanoke's desegregation plans proposed busing pupils into neighboring areas. However, U.S. District Judge Ted Dalton ordered the school remain open. In 1973 the school was restructuredhttp://trdudley.com/LAHS/ and became the Lucy Addison Junior High School, which was later renamed the Lucy Addison Middle School.

The precise structure of the enzyme‚Äôs substrate varies by species. For example, the human C-5 sterol desaturase (also known as lathosterol oxidase) oxidizes lathosterol, while its ortholog ERG3 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidizes episterol. The precise structural details of C-5 sterol desaturase substrates vary across eukaryotes. Shown below the reaction scheme are three possible distal groups along with biosynthetic pathways and species they are found in. Mechanism C-5 sterol desaturase couples sterol oxidation to the oxidation of NAD(P)H and the reduction of molecular oxygen. Either NADH or NADPH can be used; in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana C-5 sterol desaturase catalyzes the reaction twice as fast with NADH while in S. cerevisiae the enzyme has little preference. The precise details of the reaction have been thought to vary between mammals and yeast. However, the enzymes do share a conserved cluster of histidine residues, which when mutated (in A. thaliana) dramatically reduce or eliminate enzyme activity, suggesting the involvement of a coordinated iron cation in the mechanism. Mutagenesis studies suggest that in A. thaliana threonine 114 (which is a serine in humans, mice, and yeast) may help to stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex. Rahier has proposed a reaction mechanism in which an iron-coordinated oxygen abstracts a hydrogen from the substrate leading to a radical intermediate. Biological role C-5 sterol desaturase catalyzes an intermediate step in the synthesis of major sterols. The particular biosynthetic pathway varies across eukaryotes. In animals C5SD catalyzes the dehydration of lathosterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol, a step in the synthesis of cholesterol. Cholesterol serves multiple roles in the cell including modulating membrane fluidity serving as a precursor to steroid hormones. In fungi C5SD catalyzes the dehydration of episterol as a step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a sterol that regulates cell membrane fluidity and permeability. In plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, C-5 sterol desaturase catalyzes the dehydrogenation of episterol and avenasterol in a pathway thought to lead to a variety of membrane components as well as a class of hormones called brassinosteroids. =Subcellular localization= Based on its amino acid profile C-5 sterol desaturase appears to have four to five membrane-spanning regions, suggesting that it is a transmembrane protein. C5SD activity has been demonstrated in microsomes from rat tissue, implying that rat enzyme localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum Fluorescence microscopy experiments have shown that in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila C5SD localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and that in S. cerevisiae C5SD localizes to both the endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles. In Arabidopsis thaliana C5SD is located in both the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid particles. Clinical RelevanceAntifungal Resistance= The common class of antifungal drugs known as azoles disrupts the fungal sterol biosynthesis pathway, upstream of C-5 sterol desaturase leading to the accumulation of nontoxic 14Œ±-methylated sterols. C5SD then converts these intermediates into a toxic product. Consequently, in both the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans and model organism S. cerevisiae mutations in the gene encoding C-5 sterol desaturase (ERG3) allow the cell to avoid synthesizing the toxic sterol products and have been shown to confer azole resistance. In at least the case of fluconazole, antifungal resistance due to C5SD inactivation is dependent on the activity of the chaperone protein Hsp90 and the phosphatase calcineurin. However, the clinical relevance of this azole resistance mechanism is controversial because while the deletion of ERG3 alone confers fluconazole resistance to C. albicans in vitro, it is insufficient to confer fluconazole resistance in a live mouse model. =Lathosterolosis= In at least one patient, a deficiency in C-5 sterol desaturase activity (termed lathosterolosis) was associated with multiple malformations, metal retardation, and liver disease. This patient was also found to have low levels of blood cholesterol and high levels of lathosterol in cell membranes when compared to those of healthy control subjects. These symptoms resemble those of other defects in cholesterol synthesis such as Smith‚ÄìLemli‚ÄìOpitz syndrome. Potential applications Scientists have found that tomato plants engineered with the C-5 sterol desaturase from the mushroom Flammulina velutipes show improved drought tolerance and fungal pathogen resistance as well as increased iron and polyunsaturated fat content. The authors of the study suggest that the fungal enzyme may be a useful tool for plant biotechnology as improving multiple aspects of a crop is typically time- and labor-intensive.

(formerly Ziegenhahn & Diem or Zi-Di) is a German arms manufacturing company. It was founded in 1911 and is located in Benshausen. Alfred Ziegenhahn, founder of the firm, was born in 1875 in the town of Rotha in the southern part of the Harz mountain range. In 1889 he was apprenticed to Messrs. Schmidt & Habermann in Suhl, remaining with them and eventually being appointed as master gunsmith in 1922. Ziegenhahn's consuming interest in arms led to his making of rifles in his home workshop and creating ideas which could be patented. His collaboration with Messrs. Heinrich Diem in Benshausen started in 1911, at which time the combination 'Ziegenhahn-Diem' led to the name 'Zi-Di'. Alfred‚Äôs son, Fritz (born 1903), was likewise apprenticed to Schmidt & Habermann between 1917 and 1920, becoming a master gunsmith in 1933. Ten years earlier in 1923 Alfred Ziegenhahn broke his ties with Schmidt & Habermann and started up on his own, Fritz joining him. One of their first large contracts was the conversion of 30,000 Luger pistols from 7.65mm to 9mm for the German Reichswehr Army of the Weimar Republic. After World War II, American troops destroyed the company's entire inventory of weapons, running them over with trucks, and dumpled all its ammunition in Switzerland. (The ammunition was later recovered.) Banned from arms production, the company produced saw blades until 1952, when it was allowed to produce arms again. The company produced only pistols until 1981, when it resumed production of long arms. Ziegenhahn & Diem was renamed Ziegenhahn & Sohn oHG in 1993, then subsequently renamed Ziegenhahn & Sohn Jagdwaffen e.K. in 2012.

On 10 August 2017, Maj. Gen. Charouck Arirachakaran, the vice president and secretary general of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand (NOCT) stated that Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha agreed on the 2019 Games replacement plan after the Philippine's withdrawal. The candidates were Chiang Mai, Chonburi and Songkhla. Six days later, the Philippines, through the Philippine Olympic Committee president Peping Cojuangco, confirmed that the country would host the 2019 Games, after Cojuangco wrote Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte and appealed for reconsideration. =Potential hosts= These cities are the potential hosts by launching its bid or being appointed by Sports Authority of Thailand. ;Bangkok During the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, governor the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT) Kongsak Yodmanee criticised the organization of the games, as the Philippines held the games in many cities and municipalities, causing to the various concerns and controversies. He will propose to hold the next Thailand's Southeast Asian Games in \\"one\\" city or province. He also suggested Bangkok and Chonburi Province are the best choice for hosting the Thailand's games. He mentioned Bangkok traffic is less congested than Manila and the city has many existing venues for the games but water sports venues. Bangkok hosted the inaugural games in 1959 and 1967 as Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, which were the precursor to the modern Southeast Asian Games, and 1985 as Southeast Asian Games. Bangkok hosted many global and continental events such as four-time Asian Games and Summer Universiade in 2007. Bangkok will host the 2021 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games with Chonburi Province. It acted as the test event and a prelude for the future multi-sport event, a proposed Youth Olympic Games in 2026. ;Chonburi Like Bangkok, Chonburi Province was also mentioned by Kongsak.

Background Dodge City was a 36 square km area located approximately 20 km south of Danang to the west of Highway 1 and given this nickname by the Marines due to frequent ambushes and firefights there; together with Go Noi Island directly to the south it was a Vietcong and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) stronghold and base area. The Dodge City area was completely flat and criss-crossed with numerous small waterways. Dodge City was the base for the Vietcong R-20 Battalion and the PAVN 1st Battalion, 36th Regiment. The operation was planned as part of the South Vietnamese Government's Le Loi Accelerated Pacification Campaign and called for the 1st Marine Regiment to cordon and search the entire Dodge City area. Operation On the morning of 20 November 7 Marine Battalions moving overland and by helicopter established the cordon meeting light resistance losing 1 Marine killed and 25 wounded and 2 helicopters shot down. Two towers were flown into the northern area of the cordon and these would be used by snipers and for directing artillery and air support. At midday 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines began sweeping from the western side of the cordon towards the railway lines and at 16:30 Company G 2/7 Marines encountered a PAVN bunker complex in an area nicknamed the \\"Horseshoe\\" (), the Marines withdrew leaving behind 6 dead. On the morning of 21 November 2/7 Marines, supported by Company D 1st Battalion, 1st Marines and Company L 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines planned to resume their assault on the Horseshoe but were hit by intense fire before they had moved into position and the attack stalled. 2/7 Marines attacked the Horsehoe again on 22 November. Company E was hit by close-range fire as it crossed a small stream losing 7 killed and 23 wounded in 10 minutes before it could withdraw. Company D 1/1 Marines attacked from the north losing 2 dead and 17 wounded before disengaging. On the morning of 23 November 3/26 Marines moved from the southwest of the cordon towards the Horseshoe joining up with 2/7 Marines. Company H, 2/7 Marines overran several enemy positions and recovered the bodies of the 6 Marines lost on 20 November. On 24 November air and artillery strikes were directed against the Horseshoe and then in the afternoon 2/7 Marines reinforced by Company K, 3/26 Marines attacked again. At 15:30 the assault was stopped by strong enemy fire and by 18:30 the Marines withdrew again having lost 5 dead and 31 wounded. On the morning of 25 November after preparatory artillery fire 2/7 Marines moved forward encountering no resistance as the defending PAVN 3rd Battalion, 36th Regiment had withdrawn. Over the next 4 days the Marines reduced and searched the cordon area. From midnight on 28/29 November a 6-hour artillery barrage hit the cordon area and then the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines attacked along Route 4 clearing out numerous small bunkers and defensive positions. On 1 December 3/5 Marines encountered a strong enemy bunker position in an area nicknamed the \\"Hook\\" () losing 2 dead and 28 wounded before pulling back to allow artillery and air support to attack the enemy positions. 3/5 Marines attacked again on 2 December but made no progress. On 3 December 3/26 Marines joined the attack on the Hook and after an extensive air and artillery bombardment succeeded in penetrating the defensive positions by the evening of 4 December. On 5 December after a napalm attack the Marines overran the remaining defenses finding 75-100 PAVN dead. On 6 December Company E, 2/26 Marines encountered a PAVN bunker complex nicknamed the \\"Northern Bunker Complex\\" just south of the La Tho River (). On 7 December 3/26 Marines, Company H, 5th Marines and Company A, 7the Marines attacked the complex, quickly becoming pinned down and losing 10 dead and 23 wounded. The Marines withdrew into night defensive positions to allow for air and artillery strikes. At 11:20 on 8 December 3/26 Marines supported by 12 M113s from the ARVN 2nd Troop, 4th Cavalry attacked the Northern Bunker Complex finding 79 dead PAVN from the previous day's fighting. Company H was pinned down by a final line of bunkers, but the Marines used an improvised explosive device to destroy a large bunker and counted a further 39 PAVN dead in the defensive lines. Company A overran another bunker line clearing 12 bunkers and killing 47 PAVN and later engaged in a firefight with another PAVN unit killing 20 PAVN for the loss of 6 Marines. Company L engaged a PAVN platoon killing 15 PAVN for the loss of 5 Marines. As night fell Company I's lead Platoon was cut off and Sergeant Karl Taylor led a mission to rescue the wounded Marines, in addition to rescuing several wounded he silenced a PAVN machine gun position before being mortally wounded. Sergeant Taylor would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. On 9 December following an artillery bombardment (including fire from the ) the Marines began their final assault on the Northern Bunker Complex methodically destroying the PAVN positions, finding over 130 dead in the bunkers and taking 8 prisoners. Aftermath Operation Meade River concluded on 9 December 1968, the Marines had suffered 108 dead and 510 wounded and claiming that the PAVN/Vietcong 1023 killed and 123 captured. The Marines destroyed more than 360 bunkers during the operation. Despite their losses intelligence showed that by late December the Vietcong and PAVN had returned to Dodge City.

He was highly touted as a high school player, when he seemed destined to play professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 10 years professionally, but never reached the NBA. Growing up in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, Cotton was physically mature beyond his years. He gained national exposure before even playing in high school. The interest level in his prep career was arguably as high as any player ever. Due to disputes over his entrance examination scores with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), his college basketball career was delayed two years. After a lawsuit with the NCAA was settled, Cotton played one season with Alabama. He decided to forego his final two years of college eligibility to enter the 2000 NBA draft, but he went undrafted. Cotton played professionally for 10 years, both domestically as well as in numerous foreign countries. After retiring as a player, he became a basketball coach and trainer for young players. Early life Vernon Scheavalie Cotton was born in Los Angeles County at Inglewood, California, to Gaynell and James Cotton. He was named by his father after singer Maurice Chevalier. As kids could not pronounce his name, Cotton came to be known as Schea. After his family moved from San Pedro, California in 1990 due to concerns with gangs, he enrolled at St. Irenaeus Catholic School in Cypress. The school did not have any openings in the seventh grade, so Cotton repeated the sixth grade. His mother denied that he was held back to gain a physical advantage to earn an athletic scholarship. At age 12 and in the sixth grade, he stood and and was captain on a team which included seventh- and eighth-graders. That year, Cotton was featured in the Los Angeles Times. He was able to dunk on alley- oops as a seventh-grader, which was uncommon at the time. Cotton became nationally known before even reaching high school. According to ESPN in 2010, the expectations for him were \\"as great as any pre-high school aged player ever, even LeBron James.\\" By the time he was a high school freshman, Cotton had grown to and . He started the year at St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower, where he played four games. Citing a desire to play with teammates from his summer team, he transferred mid-season to Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, where many of them attended. That year, Cotton averaged 20 points and seven rebounds per game, and Mater Dei won the 1994 Southern Section Division I-A championship and advanced to the Southern California regional final. He was profiled in Sports Illustrated, who billed him as one of the nation's top high school players. \\"Don't laugh. This kid could pull it off,\\" wrote the magazine of Cotton's desire to jump directly from high school to the NBA. His games had developed a following, drawing well above-average crowds. In an era before the Internet, high school games were not televised, and his fame spread through word of mouth. Still, the interest level in Cotton at the time has been compared to the fanfare of LeBron James' prep career, and some have referred to him as \\"LeBron before LeBron.\\" Youngsters would wait for over a half-hour for his autograph. In 2014, Cal-Hi Sports hailed him as \\"arguably the most ballyhooed youth player in [California] history.\\" In his sophomore year, Cotton averaged 24 points and 10 rebounds, leading Mater Dei to a 36‚Äì1 record and a state championship, their third in 13 seasons. He was voted All- Southern Section Division I Player of the Year, and was named to the All- Southern Section Division I Team for the second straight year. Cotton also became the first and only sophomore to be named Cal-Hi Sports Division I State Player of the Year, and was honored nationally as a fourth-team Parade All- American. He wore 37 pairs of shoes that year, a new pair for each game courtesy of Nike. According to Cotton, \\"I basically had a shoe contract in high school, to be honest, without the money.\\" After two years at one of the country's top programs in Mater Dei, Cotton returned to St. John Bosco. The school received little press coverage, and he had grown weary of the attention he garnered at Mater Dei. In his junior year, Cotton broke a bone in his left hand and missed most of the season. Though he played in only 11 games, he was named a first-team Parade All-American. He missed his senior year after undergoing surgery to repair damaged ligaments in his left shoulder. He had suffered the injury over the summer in an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) game against Lamar Odom. Despite being sidelined, one recruiting service tabbed him as the No. 2 high school prospect in the nation. College career A report from a Las Vegas newspaper during Cotton's junior year speculated that he was considering entering the NBA draft after his senior year. Still, he committed in 1996 to play for Long Beach State. However, his brother, James, announced in 1997 that he would be leaving the school early and declaring for the NBA draft, prompting Cotton to request and receive a release from his letter of intent. Afterwards, some college coaches believed Cotton would jump directly to the NBA. Although Kevin Garnett triggered a second generation of NBA high school draftees in 1995, followed by Kobe Bryant and Jermaine O'Neal a year later, college remained the predominant choice at the time for top prep players. In April 1997, he committed to play at UCLA, where he was expected to team with fellow incoming freshman Baron Davis, another top recruit from Los Angeles, who signed days later. Cotton's admission was contingent on earning a qualifying score on the SAT, which he had not received in two attempts. On his third try, he scored 900, which surpassed the NCAA minimum of 700 for incoming freshman, but the NCAA invalidated his score. Cotton had been diagnosed with a learning disability, auditory learning, in which he comprehended better by listening than by seeing. The Educational Testing Service (ETS), which publishes and oversees the SAT, confirmed the diagnosis, and allowed him to take the test with extra time and larger font text. The NCAA, however, had stricter criteria than the ETS, and disagreed that he was entitled to take the non-standard test. Cotton denied any wrongdoing, and felt he was being targeted by the NCAA. Earlier, the NCAA had investigated a Ford sport-utility vehicle driven by Cotton, which they suspected was provided to him as an incentive to sign with UCLA. However, the NCAA absolved him of violating his amateur status based on documents provided by his parents. Blocked from attending UCLA, Cotton enrolled at St. Thomas More, a prep school in Connecticut where players had gone to enhance their academic profile and play in a competitive environment. After one year, he signed with North Carolina State, but the NCAA again contested his SATs and prevented his enrollment. Instead, Cotton returned home to attend junior college at Long Beach City College, where his games attracted NBA scouts. He averaged 25.8 points and 5.8 rebounds and was named a junior college All-American, leading Long Beach to a 33‚Äì3 record. In parallel, his family sued the NCAA in September 1998; the case was settled four months later. The Cottons said they spent $60,000 battling the NCAA. After being declared eligible by the NCAA, Cotton earned a scholarship to play college ball with Alabama. As a sophomore at Alabama in 1999‚Äì2000, the 21-year-old Cotton was the team's most veteran player. With four freshman starters, the Crimson Tide were among the youngest teams in Division I. Although the team struggled, Cotton averaged a team-leading 15.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, and he earned second-team all-conference honors in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Playing out of position as an undersized power forward, he did not help to address critics of his perimeter skills. Forgoing his remaining two years of college eligibility, he hired an agent and declared early for the NBA. In 2010, he expressed disappointment in his college experience. \\"If I had known what I know now, I would probably have skipped college,\\" said Cotton. Professional career Many expected Cotton to be selected in the second round of the 2000 NBA draft, but he went undrafted. He called the experience an \\"embarrassing moment, and it was devastating.\\" The Orlando Magic invited him to play in the Orlando Summer League, but the team's summer season ended after just one day when Magic player Conrad McRae collapsed and died during practice. Later that summer, Cotton was drafted fourth overall by the Anaheim Roadrunners of the American Basketball Association (ABA), but the team was unable to secure the Honda Center (known then as Arrowhead Pond) as its home arena, and he never played for them. He was also drafted by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), but he was their last cut in training camp after not having shot well. Cotton remained confident that he could play in the NBA, buoyed by the knowledge that past opponents that he had either outplayed or held his own against had eventually made it in the league. Ultimately, he never played in the NBA. In 2002, the NBA Development League allocated him to the Huntsville Flight. On the first day of practice, he pulled his thigh muscle, and was still unable to play the next day. He was eventually cut. Cotton played for the Los Angeles Clippers in the Summer Pro League in 2003. In November 2007, he was selected by the Tulsa 66ers in the ninth round of the 2007 NBA Development League Draft, but he was waived a couple of weeks later. Nonetheless, Cotton played professionally for 10 years, and picked up several languages over a career that saw him play in seven countries and numerous U.S. leagues. He landed with KK Partizan in Belgrade, Serbia, where he played 20 games for Vlade Divac's former team in 2002. He then joined the Shanghai Sharks, Yao Ming's former team in China. After playing abroad for two years, Cotton returned to Long Beach in 2003 to play for the ABA's Long Beach Jam‚Äîhe was the first player signed by the new franchise. Domestically, he also played in the United States Basketball League and toured with the Harlem Globetrotters. His career also took him overseas to France, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Mexico. After retiring from playing, Cotton became a basketball trainer with his own academy, as well as a coach in Los Angeles for Millikan High School and Belmont Shore in AAU. In 2016, he premiered his documentary, Manchild: The Schea Cotton Story, which covers his rise as a high school sensation and the letdown of not reaching the NBA. Player profile Entering high school, Cotton's physical maturity provided him the size, speed, and power to dominate his opponents. \\"He is a kid in a man's body,\\" said Toby Bailey, who faced a freshman Cotton in the Southern Section Division I-A semifinals in 1994. As a sophomore, Cotton was described by the Chicago Tribune as \\"already a complete player with upper-body strength of a college senior.\\" However, he did not undergo a second growth spurt. As he grew older, his strength and size were no longer an advantage like they were in high school. Cotton became too short to be a forward, but was not quick enough to defend guards. His jump shot and ball-handling ability were suspect by NBA standards. \\"I never thought he could play,\\" said NBA scout Marty Blake.

History  In 1976, during Operation Savannah, a need was identified for more operational special forces units and in particular units with more specialised skills. In March 1976, Major Malcolm Kinghorn formed a sub-unit specialising in amphibious operations for use in Angola during Operation Savannah. It was formed at Salisbury Island, Durban and consisted of a headquarters unit of Kinghorn and a NCO and two units of six men each and was called Charlie (C) Group of 1 Reconnaissance Commando. On 1 May 1976, the Defence Minister approved the formation of 4 Reconnaissance Commando but it would take a further two years before it was formally established. The unit was formed on the 17 July 1978 as 4 Reconnaissance Commando at Langebaan with Major Kinghorn as the first commanding officer and the first RSM was Warrant Officer ‚ÄúChili‚Äù du Plessis. It was initially made up of members of 1 Reconnaissance Commando. On 1 January 1979, Major Kinghorn was given a temporary rank of Commandant. During the 1981 reorganisation, 4 Reconnaissance Commando was renamed 4 Reconnaissance Regiment (4RR). The unit was said to be small with mainly white soldiers who operated in Angola and Mozambique Structure In 1978, 4 Reconnaissance Commando was initially structured into three groups: * Alpha Group ‚Äì amphibious operations training, * Bravo Group ‚Äì operational, * Charlie Group ‚Äì diving, but when 4 Reconnaissance Commando was renamed 4 Reconnaissance Regiment in 1981 it was structured as: 4.1 Commando ‚Äì operational component with five teams: * Diving Team ‚Äì offensive operational attack divers * Boat Team ‚Äì maintain and operate the teams boats and work with the naval vessels crews * Offensive Team ‚Äì carried out the special forces tasks * Small Teams ‚Äì carry out reconnaissance and lead the offensive teams to the targets * Reconnaissance Team ‚Äì handle intelligence gathering operations in larger teams 4.2 Commando ‚Äì training element later called Special Forces Amphibious and Urban School Re- organisation after 1992 The next reorganisation occurred in 1992 when the Special Forces HQ was disbanded and renamed the Directorate Reconnaissance Forces and 4 RR remained but 2RR, the citizen force unit, was disbanded. In 1993, a further reorganisation occurred when the Directorate Reconnaissance Forces was renamed as the 45 Para Brigade and 4 Reconnaissance Commando was renamed the 453 Para Battalion. The last change occurred in 1995, 45 Para Brigade became the Special Forces Brigade and subsequently 453 Para Battalion is now called 4 Special Forces Regiment.

Biography Birth and Early Education= Boon Mark Gittisarn was born on September 1, 1898, in Ratchaburi province in Thailand. In 1921, he completed his secondary education at Bangkok Christian College, where he had made a profession of faith in Jesus Christ. =Evangelistic Work= Upon completion of his studies, Boon Mark was employed by the American Presbyterian Mission in Siam as an evangelist in Phitsanulok province. In 1930, Boon Mark graduated from McGilvary College of Divinity, which is now a college of Payap University in Chiang Mai. In 1933, he moved to Bangkok and continued working as an evangelist of the American Presbyterian Mission. In April 1934, at the first General Assembly of the newly formed Church of Christ in Thailand [CCT], Boon Mark was elected as assistant secretary. In August 1934, he was ordained to the pastorate of Second Church in Bangkok. In 1938 and 1939, BoonMark served as translator for Chinese evangelist John Sung and became an outspoken supporter of Sung. The Church of Christ in Thailand elected Boon Mark as general secretary in 1938, a position which he held until after World War II. During the war, the Japanese occupation forces prohibited public Christian worship services, and confiscated Christian church buildings, schools, and hospital. Boon Mark traveled widely throughout Thailand at this time, encouraging members of the CCT to endure the difficulties that they were facing. =Advocacy for Pentecostalism= T.L. Osborn In 1948, Boon Mark withdrew from the Church of Christ in Thailand because he did not agree with the CCT‚Äôs decision to join the World Council of Churches. He objected to liberal theology and ecumenism which Boon Mark viewed as a compromise of Biblical Christianity. After his departure from the CCT, Boon Mark became associated with Pentecostal missionaries from Finland and became an early advocate for Pentecostalism in Thailand. Boon Mark played an important role in the 1956 Bangkok crusade meetings of American Pentecostal healing evangelist T.L. Osborn, for whom he translated during the meetings. Boon Mark later associated himself with the United Pentecostal Church (UPC), a group whom he met on a visit to the United States. From the UPC church denomination, Boon Mark learned of the \\"Jesus Only\\" teaching, which maintains that Christians should be baptized only in the name of Jesus, not in the name of God the Father or the Holy Spirit. When Boon Mark brought the \\"Jesus Only\\" teaching back to Thailand and began teaching it in Thai Pentecostal churches, some people agreed with him, while others did not. The division caused a split within the Pentecostal churches in Thailand. The United Pentecostal Church initially experienced rapid growth in Thailand, but then experienced rapid decline after Boon Mark withdrew from the group in the late 1960s. =Founding of Thailand's first independent church= Bangkok Church In 1957, Boon Mark founded Bangkok Church, the first independent church in Thailand. He also founded the Association of Independent Churches in Thailand, of which he served as general secretary. =Death= Boon Mark Gittisarn died on May 20, 1987.

The purpose of this museum is to keep the memory of the civil war in the history of Cambodia alive and to preserve the unique collection for posterity. History 2001 ‚Äì Start In February 2001 the Siem Reap War Museum was built on more than 2 hectares of land, just off National Road 6 between the airport and the city center of Siem Reap. 2008 ‚Äì Visits drop off For 12 years the Siem Reap War Museum was neglected and deteriorating rapidly. The museum was facing a battle to stay open in the face of mass desertion by tourists: visitor numbers had dwindled to about 20 a day. 2013 ‚Äì New beginning In 2013 a new general manager (Mr R.S. Esselaar) was appointed and the name of the museum was changed from Siem Reap War Museum into War Museum Cambodia. Although the museum was badly damaged by a powerful small tornado on the 18th of May 2015, over the years many improvements were made and new visitor records were achieved: the museum had definitely been put on the map. 2016 ‚Äì Rebuilding In 2016 the rebuilding of the whole museum had started, beginning with the new Landmine House in the back of the museum which was finally opened in 2018.http://www.warmuseumcambodia.com/museum/history/ Collections The War Museum Cambodia has a unique collection. Since 1999 the collection on display was gathered from where fighting took place (Anlong Veng, Siem Reap, Odor Meanchey). It is a mix of Chinese, U.S. and Soviet hardware. Before used in Cambodia, some of these war machines have even seen action during World War II. The museums collection is invaluable as most war relics have been sold for scrap. People have been gathering and selling such equipment because they got good money for scrap metal. For a tank they could have received $300 to $400 at least. Competition from scrap dealers was not the only problem the museum faced as it gathered its collection: most of the machinery was very heavy and it was difficult to gain access to dense jungle areas to remove the items. Over the years the collection was supplemented by Western private individuals like military collector Geoffrey Oldham, furthermore some artifacts were given to the museum by the General Manager (Mr R.S. Esselaar) who found some of these artifacts during visits to several remote villages. To preserve the unique collection for posterity Project Preservation was launched in 2015, certain artifacts were brought back in the original state, from other artifacts the rust was removed and they were being oiled. There is a vast array of vehicles, artillery, weaponry and equipment on display. You will be able to see e.g. war machines like the tank T-54, the jet fighter aircraft MiG-19, the helicopter Mil Mi-8 and the field artillery gun 85-mm divisional gun D-44.

Plot summary The book details one woman‚Äôs struggle with Alzheimer's (or dementia, it‚Äôs not clear) and how her family respond to it. In particular, it is one of her son‚Äôs voice the reader hears since he is narrating it. Another son isn‚Äôt involved so much as he is living in Boston practicing as a neuroscientist. So it is the narrator who bears most of the burden. And all the while, he is trying to work on his marriage and his career as a philosophy professor. His own family life is hardly acknowledged and tears in his marriage begin to show, towards his wife; there for moral support but can't come to terms with him not being a consistent, central figure at the moment. While her illness begins with her repeating stories ad nauseam, things get much worse as she starts to be incapable of recognizing her own family. Thus the prime caretaker ‚Äì the son ‚Äì ends up separating from his wife and living in derelict conditions. Nonetheless, he remains positive about the nature of life and death, even once he has lost both his parents, concluding that he ‚Äúknow[s] that there is a life beyond this death, a time beyond this time. I know that at the very last moment‚Ä¶I will be face to face at last with a pure and heartless reality beyond anything a living soul can possibly imagine.‚Äù Themes The themes of the book are: mental illness, Alzheimer's, aging, adolescence, survival, suffering, familial relationships, love, marital discord, father-son relationship, chronic illness, nursing. Awards Shortlisted for the Booker Prize (1994) and Whitbread Awards. Acclaim Scar Tissue has received substantial acclaim. It was described as: ‚Äúpowerful Alzheimer's novel [that is] searing and autobiographical‚Äù by Marsha Lederman. She adds that the book is: ‚Äúintense, unblinking and beautifully written, the novel was written in a three-month burst‚Äù in the early 1990s, as Ignatieff struggled with his mother‚Äôs Alzheimer's (she was still alive when he wrote it) and the death, in 1989, of his father.‚Äù According to Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, ‚ÄúIgnatieff has written a fierce novel about loss.‚Äù Kirkus Reviews wrote: ‚ÄúDisease not as a metaphor but as a prescription for living in a book that confronts our worst fears with bracing insight and finely tuned emotion. A tough read but worth it.‚Äù A review in Literature Annotations pointed out: ‚ÄúA hauntingly beautiful narrative, written on several levels from flashback, to pop-scientific journalism (including allusions to the writings of Oliver Sacks), to academic speeches and essays on the nature of death, composed by the protagonist for his students, public, and publishers.‚Äù The Sunday Telegraph said that Scar Tissue was ‚Äúmoving and intellectually challenging. The New Statesman claimed that ‚Äúno recent British novel has traversed the world of reason and emotion, the human presence and its annihilation, so effectively and directly.‚Äù According to Connor Taylor, ‚Äúthis novel seems to exhibit his impressive fiction-writing skills.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThough at times the novel seemed almost overly dramatic, Scar Tissue‚Äôs emotional depth and intellectually stimulating content result in a stunning success for Ignatieff‚Äôs second foray into fiction.‚Äù Theatre adaptation Scar Tissue was adapted for theatre and shown at the Arts Club Theatre Company's Revue Stage in Vancouver.

It is found in northern Australia, in the Gulf Country, the Kimberley and around Darwin. First described in 1983, they have become established in the aquarium trade worldwide. Description The Neon blue-eye is a small fish, attaining a total length of . It is a sexually dimorphic species in which the males are colourful being a metallic blue on their backs, dotted with small black spots, a narrow black stripe along the centre of their flanks separates the blue back from the translucent to yellowish white lower half of their body. There is a small yellowish patch to the rear of the first dorsal fin and dusky leading edges to the fins. The females are plainer being semi-transparent silvery-grey with translucent fins and a white belly. Distribution The neon blue-eye is found in northern Australia where it has a disjunct distribution from Crab Creek east of Broome and around Wyndham in Western Australia, in the Northern Territory they have been recorded between Darwin and the Cobourg Peninsula, as well as on Melville Island and in the basin of the Norman River on Queensland's Gulf of Carpentaria coast. Habitat and biology The neon blue- eye is euryhaline species which can tolerate a wide range of ecological conditions although it shows a preference for muddy creeks lined with mangrove. It can also occur in pure freshwater habitats, especially during the monsoon. In the wild the neon blue-eye is a seasonal breeder with spawning usually taking place from October to December. The appear to prefer to breed in groups of multiple males and females with the males usingtheir dorsal and anal fins to display to the females while actively pursuing them. During display the colour of both sexes becomes more intense. The females who are not receptive to breeding avoid the males by swimming to near the surface or by hiding among vegetation. The eggs are scattered among aquatic plants and stick to these by means of adhesive filaments on their outer coat. The eggs hatch in around 12-15 days. This species is mainly a carnivore and they feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, insect larvae, and small aquatic crustaceans. Discovery and naming The neon blue-eye was first discovered by Helen K. Larson in 1981 near Darwin before Neil Sarti found it in Crab Creek near Broome a year later.

The La Martyre complex comprises the parish church dedicated to Saint Salomon, a \\"porte triomphale\\" and an ossuary/chapel. It was founded by the Rohan family and replaced an earlier church which had been called \\"Notre Dame du Merzer\\". The church is dedicated to the Breton King Salomon. Much of the church was restored after storm damage in 1450 but the ossuary is of a much later date, being built in 1619. The outstanding features are the south porch which is essentially flamboyant Gothic in style with a decorated entrance arch, the \\"porte triomphale\\" entrance and the ossuary. Inside the church there are some notable furnishings. The village owes its name to the assassination on 25 June 874 of King Salomon of Brittany, who had sought refuge in the village church. The church was called \\"la Martyre\\" (Ar Merzher, the Martyr) after its desecration, and the name was taken up by the village. As for the king, he was canonised in 910 for his martyrdom. The church, the cemetery gate, the calvary and the former chapel are a listed historical monument since 1916. Eglise Saint-Salomon The enclosure entrance or \\"porte triomphale\\" The central arch of the \\"porte triomphale\\". We can see the three crosses of the Calvary, the piet√† over the central arch, the balustraded walkway and the Rohan coat of arms The entrance to the \\"enclos\\" dates to the 15th/16th century and has the three crosses at the top and a walkway. The calvary comprises three crosses; the crucifixion cross with smaller crosses bearing the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad robber\\". Jesus is shown hanging on the central or crucifixion cross and on the reverse side of this cross there is a depiction of the \\"Risen Christ\\" with Jesus being shown emerging from his tomb. At the foot of the \\"good\\" robber's cross is an angel who waits to whisk the robber's soul off to heaven whilst beneath the \\"bad\\" robber's cross, a demonic figure waits to take that robber's soul down into hell. The building to the left of the entrance was once the look-out post from which the borders of the medieval kingdom, then the duchy of Cornouaille, were watched.

There is an angel at the base of his cross, ready to take his soul to heaven The ossuary The entrance to the ossuary positioned to the right of the south porch. At the top of the facade and within the gable (\\"pignon\\") area is a lantern like structure which contains the depiction of a small kneeling angel and under this is a depiction of Saint Aurelian (Saint Pol de L√©on) who has just slain a dragon. A woman and a man stand on either side, their hands behind their backs. Also in the gable area are small reliefs depicting a man with a beard on the left and a man without a beard on the right. Beneath Saint Aurelian and on the architrave are depictions of a woman on the left and a man on the right. They are positioned on either side of a depiction of the \\"Order of Saint Michel\\". The woman has long hair and has one hand resting on her chest whilst, with the other hand, she points across to the man on the right who brandishes a skull and a bone. Below two angels hold banners with inscriptions in Breton. It was two years after working on the porch at Guimiliau that the \\"Ma√Ætre de Plougastel\\" was commissioned in 1619 to work on the ossuary at La Martyre, and he built it in the \\"Renaissance\\" style. In the upper gable or \\"pignon\\" there is a small, lantern-like structure in which a small angel is shown kneeling in prayer. Beneath, on a dais, is a statue of Saint Aurelian who has just slain a dragon. A woman and a man stand on either side of him, their arms held behind their backs. Also in the gable area there are two small reliefs, one depicting a man with a beard and the other a man without a beard. Further down two angels are depicted holding banners with extracts from a 1575 religious poem \\"Mirouer de la mort\\". Higher up on the architrave are three relief carvings. That on the left depicts a woman with one hand resting on her chest whilst she points with her other hand to a carving on the right depicting a man brandishing a skull and a human bone.

The south porch The church possesses a beautiful south porch dating to 1450-1455 and celebrating the Nativity with scenes from Jesus Christ's childhood carved into the arch's voussures. In the angle of the arch, two small winged angels hold the coat of arms of the local Kersauzon family who had donated funds for the church building. The porch is flanked with buttresses with decorated Gothic pinnacles and empty niches. A depiction of the crowning of the Virgin Mary decorates the summit of the gable, a theme said to have been inspired by the tympanum on the porch of the church in Senlis (there was no reference to such an event in the Bible). As part of the gable two kneeling angels with phylacteries float in the air and a little higher another two angels are kneeling in prayer. In the scene depicting the crowning of the Virgin Mary, God is shown lifting his hand toward the Virgin Mary in blessing and behind him is an angel. Two further angels are behind the Virgin Mary. The pi√©droits and voussures of the south porch depict angels with shields and banners, an angel holding an open book and scenes from Jesus' birth and childhood, including the Annunciation and the Adoration of the Magi, the Visitation (Christianity) and the marriage of the Virgin Mary, the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple and Jesus with the lawyers. Higher up there is a depiction of a man wearing a crown and carrying a cross. He gives instructions to his army represented by three small figures in armour. Some historians have thought this a depiction of Herod giving an order for the massacre of the innocents whilst others believe it to be a depiction of King Solomon. There are also depictions of Saint Sebastian, Saint Lawrence and other saints and church dignitaries. Inside the porch are statues of the apostles, measuring between 80 and 90 centimetres in height. Some can be identified but not all of them. In the southeast corner of the entrance porch is a stoup with a depiction of the \\"Ankou\\". On the \\"trumeau\\" between the two doors by which one can access the church once inside the porch, is a depiction of the Virgin Mary with child. It is 1.22 metres high and carved from kersanton stone. Above the doors are the coats of arms of the Rohan and L√©on families. The double door dates to 1692. Other depictions in the voussures are of Saint Sebastian with arrow, Saint Lawrence with grille, Guy de Maufuric de Lezuzan and Saint Fiacre. Work on the south porch is attributed to the Atelier du Folgo√´t. File:La Martyre esglesia 7193 resize.jpgAt the top of the porch gable we see two kneeling angels and below them the two \\"floating\\" angels. Above the entrance is a tympanum depicting the Nativity. The Virgin Mary lies on a bed with Joseph sat at the foot of the bed. The heads of two cattle peer out from the wall above the Virgin Mary. A previous rector had had the main part of Mary's body chiseled away as it was thought inappropriate. In the voussures and pi√©droits we can see several angels and other depictions and at the base of the right hand side we can see the depiction of the Adoration of the Magi. At the far end of the porch we can make out the two doors giving access to the church. File:Breizh 29 - ar merzher salaun - porched iliz sant salaun 01.JPGView of the south porch.

One description of the ankou is that of a tall, haggard figure with long white hair. He is also depicted as a skeleton and has a revolving head able to see everything everywhere. The Ankou is said to drive a cart and stops at the house of someone who is about to die, ready to take them off.

History St Mark's was built in 182528 as a response to the shortage of churches in the area. The population in Mayfair had grown with the demand for town houses by the aristocracy and the wealthy, as they moved in from the country. The building was constructed in the Greek revival style to the designs of John Peter Gandy. Gandy was a highly regarded architect of the Greek Revival style, and produced most of his work in neo-classical designs, with St Mark's being one of the finest examples. In 1878 the architect Arthur Blomfield made significant changes to the church, adding a timber roof, and introducing Gothic style features. The fa√ßade, together with the elegant porch, is known as one of the finest in London. The church was listed in 1958. It was deconsecrated in 1974 and was included on English Heritage‚Äôs \\"Buildings at Risk\\" register for over 20 years. Hammer Holdings Limited successfully applied for planning permission to convert the building into a 'wellness centre' in 2006, but a campaign led by Lady Sainsbury succeeded in blocking the proposal. It was subsequently acquired by One Events in 2009 to as a mixed-use venue. In July 2014 the building was acquired by Grosvenor Estates. History as a place of worship Edward Thomas Daniell, known for his watercolour paintings of the Near East and his etchings of Norfolk, was appointed to the curacy of the church in 1834. During the Second World War, St Mark's became informally known as The American Church in London due to its proximity to the United States embassy and as a centre for American worshippers. It was visited by President Dwight Eisenhower and the political figure, diplomat and activist Eleanor Roosevelt when she was First Lady of the United States. On the 29 September 1949, St. Mark‚Äôs was the venue for the wedding of George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood and pianist Marion Stein, which was attended by King George VI and other members of the royal family. A wedding anthem specially composed and conducted by Benjamin Britten was performed at the service.. The congregation dwindled during the 1950s and 1960s, until the church was declared redundant in 1974. It remained empty from 1975 to 1994. That year the Diocese of London allowed the use of the church by The Commonwealth Christian Fellowship led by Rod and Julie Anderson, who met there with a congregation of around 120 and provided an out-reach programme for anti-knife crime training for teenagers, home visits for elderly people and help for the homeless. The church was used in this way until 2008. Between February and May 2015 the church hosted This Present House. Music In its heyday, the church had one of the finest choirs in London. The organ, designed by Maurice Vinden, was one of Rushworth and Dreaper's finest and was moved to Holy Trinity, Brompton Street, when St Mark's became redundant. Recent history St Mark's Church Mayfair - interior in August 2020 The building has been used for other events, such as by Nike, The London Summer Show, London Fashion Week and by Grosvenor Estates.

It went into operation in 1926 and was originally a section of the Brandenburg Bypass Railway, which was built to remove freight traffic from the railways through Berlin. The section between Saarmund and Genshagener Heide has been included in the Berlin Outer Ring since the 1950s. Route Beginning of the line in Michendorf station The double-track line begins in Michendorf station, where it separates there from the Berlin-Blankenheim railway. The line runs to the east. In Saarmund it joins the also double-track line of the Berlin Outer Ring from Golm. Beyond Genshagener Heide station and the crossing of the Anhalt railway opened in 1926, the Michendorf‚ÄìGro√übeeren railway separates from the Outer Ring and runs to the north as a single track on the eastern side of the Anhalt line. Originally the line connected in Gro√übeeren station to the Anhalt line. Since its reconstruction in 2006, it has only connected to the Gro√übeeren intermodal freight centre (G√ºterverkehrszentrum, GVZ) and the Teltow freight yard. A direct connection to Berlin no longer exists. Traffic between the Outer Ring and the Anhalt line in the Berlin area has since been operated over a new connection curve to the west of the Anhalt line. As a result of the inclusion of the Saarmund‚ÄìGenshagener Heide section in the Outer Ring, the identification number (VzG) used by DB Netz for the track between Saarmund and Genshagener Heide (6126) is one used for a longer section of the Outer Ring, but the chainage used on this section is part of the original chainage for the line between Michendorf and Gro√übeeren. History At the end of the 19th century there were plans for the construction of a bypass railway around Berlin to relieve the congested lines in the city of freight for strategic military reasons. Between 1902 and 1908, the western section of the bypass between Treuenbrietzen, Beelitz, Potsdam Wildpark, Wustermark and Nauen went into operation. In 1915, another section of the bypass railway to the north of Berlin, the Nauen‚ÄìOranienburg railway, was opened. From the beginning, there were various plans for the extension of the bypass railway to the south of Berlin. Their implementation was initially prevented by the outbreak of the First World War. In 1923/1924 the large marshalling yard at Seddin was opened. It increased the need for the southern bypass railway. Initially a separate line was opened between Seddin and Michendorf next to the Berlin-Blankenheim railway. On 1 December 1926, the bypass railway was opened from Michendorf to the Anhalt railway at Gro√übeeren. It served only freight traffic. An extension of the line to the east to the K√∂penick/Mahlsdorf area was planned, but it was not built because of the onset of the Great Depression. The Nazis planned a large marshalling yard in Gro√übeeren. Instead of extendending the line to the east from Genshagener Heide, they planned to extend the line on a route trending further north as the Outer Freight Ring (G√ºterau√üenring), branching off from the Anhalt line in the Teltow area. The marshalling yard and the Outer Freight Ring went into provisional operations in early 1940. The route of the Bypass Railway between Michendorf and Genshagener Heide was duplicated at this time and a locomotive depot (Betriebsbahnhof) was built at Genshagener Heide. =After the Second World War = The Bypass Railway from Michendorf and the Outer Ring from Potsdam come together at Saarmund station Soon after the Second World War‚Äîwith the developing division of Germany and division of Berlin‚Äîthe Soviet occupation forces and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, founded in 1949) needed effective bypass routes around West Berlin. The Outer Freight Ring, which partly ran through West Berlin, was not suitable for this. Several connecting routes around Berlin emerged in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but they were inefficient and some were too far away from Berlin. The first section of the Outer Ring was opened to the east of Genshagener Heide and a subsequent section was opened towards Sch√∂nefeld and Gr√ºnau cross; these connected to the existing line from Seddin marshalling yard. The last phase of construction of the outer ring was in the late 1950s, when the section between Golm and Saarmund was put in operation, so that the Saarmund‚ÄìGro√übeeren section of the bypass became part of the outer ring. The section between Michendorf and Saarmund remained of great importance as a connection to the Seddin marshalling yard. In the early 1950s, operations on the mainline tracks of the Anhalt railway between Teltow and West Berlin were abandoned. Nevertheless, the connection from Genshagener Heide to Gro√übeeren was important for connecting to several rail freight users in Teltow. The line was electrified in 1982. Thus, the line towards Halle and Leipzig was connected to the Seddin marshalling yard; more electrification in subsequent years connected the main lines to Berlin and to the north of East Germany. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, a number of direct connections to West Berlin were reopened. The direct line between Michendorf and Berlin-Wannsee was already in operation for freight traffic. The Anhalt Railway in the Berlin area was reopened in 2006 along with the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof. As part of this project, the junction of the Michendorf‚ÄìGro√übeeren railway in Gro√übeeren station was rebuilt and a new connecting curve was built west of the old line. =Traffic = Gro√übeeren: the Bypass Railway in the foreground and the Anhalt Railway in the background The route was initially used only for freight. Briefly, in the late 1930s, there were services carrying factory workers to the Daimler-Benz armaments factory in the Genshagener Heide area. In the mid-1950s, passenger services started on the line. It was first served by some express and semi-fast passenger trains from East Berlin towards Dessau and there were also passenger trains on the section from Genshagener Heide to Michendorf, some continuing to Belzig. At times, up to about 1970, the section from Genshagener Heide to Gro√übeeren and continuing to Teltow was served by some trains during the peak hour because, on the one hand, the Ludwigsfelde car factory had been built near Genshagener Heide station and, on the other hand, it gave a connection towards Berlin. With the completion of the Outer Ring, passenger trains to Potsdam no longer stopped in Michendorf. Bergholz station provided an interchange with services to Michendorf. Some express trains from Berlin to Dessau continued to use the section between Saarmund and Michendorf. After German reunification, trains running towards Dessau again took the direct route from Berlin-Wannsee . The section between Saarmund and Genshagener Heide was served by RB 22 services, which ran over the Outer Ring between Potsdam and Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld. From 1998 to 2011, the service passed through Michendorf, so that in these years the section from Michendorf to Genshagener Heide was again served by passenger services. Since the end of 2011, the line has run from Potsdam to Saarmund directly over the Outer Ring. For another year until December 2012, some trains from Berlin to Belzig that had been diverted due to construction ran on the section. Only the section from Saarmund to Genshagener Heide is now served by passenger services. In freight transport, the line is important for connecting to and from Seddin marshalling yard and for trains from southern and western Germany to the east that bypass central Berlin. Because freight transport continues to bypass the inner part of the city, the reopening of the connections to West Berlin did not much change the importance of the line for freight traffic. However, the volume of freight on the railway declined compared to the situation during the existence of the German Democratic Republic.

It is distinguished by its unusual foliage and bottlebrush spikes of red flowers. Description Melaleuca coccinea grows to a height of about with many slender, tangled branches. The leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate) along the branches, lack a stalk, are , wide, egg-shaped to heart- shaped, dished and have a pointed but not sharp end. The flowers are brilliant red, arranged in bottlebrush-like spikes, long and about diameter on side branches. The petals are long and fall off soon after the flower opens. The stamens, which give the flowers their colour, are arranged in five bundles, each containing 11 to 15 stamens. Flowers appear in spring and summer and are following by fruit which are hairy, woody capsules , tightly clustered in a cylindrical group. Ravensthorpe M coccinea flowers and fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca coccinea was first formally described in 1966 by Alex George in The Western Australian Naturalist from a specimen \\"collected east of Karonie, on the Transcontinental railway; in sandy loam over granite.\\" In 1990, two subspecies were described by Kirsten Cowley and given the names Melaleuca coccinea subsp. eximia and Melaleuca coccinea subsp. penicula but these were later raised to species status Melaleuca eximia and Melaleuca penicula respectively by Craven and Lepschi. The specific epithet (coccinea) is a Latin word meaning \\"deep red\\" or \\"crimson, referring to the colour of the flowers. Distribution and habitat Goldfields bottlebrush occurs in the Kalgoorlie-Norseman area, in the Coolgardie and Esperance biogeographical regions of Western Australia. It grows in sandy loam over granite near granite outcrops, on sandplains and river valleys.

The series features transforming cars ‚Äî some of which are designed after Kia Motors vehicles. The series is available in Korean and English on Young Toys' official YouTube channel. The toy line beat Lego as South Korea's most popular toy line in 2013. An official English dub was produced in Canada by Ocean Productions and its sister studio Blue Water Studios. A spinoff series known as Athlon aired in three seasons from 2016-2017, before getting rebooted in 2018 as Tobot V (in English dub version known as Tobot: Galaxy Detectives), with animation done by Studio Button instead of Retrobot. PlotOriginal version= While investigating a string of mysterious car accidents, Dr. Franklin Char is abducted by the perpetrators. This incident activates his creations called \\"Tobots\\", cars that transform into robots with a special key called a \\"Tokey\\". Dr. Char's first two Tobots, Tobot X and Tobot Y, are entrusted to his twin sons Ryan and Kory, respectively, to fight crime and protect their neighborhood. Production Title card of Tobot Galaxy Detectives (or Tobot V) Young Toys came up with the idea of developing an animated series and related toys during the early 2000s. While Transformers and Power Rangers are popular among older elementary school children, Young Toys decided to Tobot to younger primary school children and kindergarteners. Rather than obtain licenses from animation studios after production, Young Toys did the opposite by developing the animated series and characters from scratch before producing the toys. Marketing Between August and October 2014, Young Toys sold the licenses for the Tobot toys and characters to Southeast Asian nations. The series was made available in some Middle Eastern countries in January 2015. In December 2014, Young Toys erected an eight- meter, three ton statue of Deltatron at the Sky Park outside Seoul's Lotte Mall Gimpo International Airport shopping complex to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Tobot. The statue was on display until 2019.

It was built in the 1460s and is an example of the regional style of Indo-Islamic architecture under the Bahmani Sultanate. This heritage structure is placed under the list of monuments of national importance. Founded by the prime-minister of the Bahamani empire in the late 15th century, it bears testimony to the scholarly genius of Mahmud Gawan, who first came to Delhi as a Persian trader (in exile) from Gilan in Iran and moved to Bidar in 1453. Mahmud reportedly built the madrasa with his own money and it functioned like a residential University which was built and maintained on the lines of Madrasa of Khurasan. The imposing and spacious building of the institution is considered as an architectural gem and an important landmark of Bidar. Location Situated on the Deccan Plateau 2330 feet above the sea level, Bidar has long been a place of Cultural and Historical Importance. The monument is located between the Chowbara (Clock Tower) and the fort from where it is a few hundred meters away. Remains of the monument stand strong amongst the chaos of urban settlement around it. Its principal east facade, now partly ruined, faces the city's main street leading to the citadel. Description The Madrasa (religious seminary) has been a striking building though long in a ruinous condition. It occupied an area of 205 feet by 180, and was entered by a large gateway on the east in front of which it had two lofty towers about a hundred feet high. The rooms surround an open area 100 feet square, in the middle of each of three sides of which was a large apartment or hall 26 feet wide by about 52 in length, rising to the full height of building, which is of three stories. Each of these hall has a dome on the outer end over the oriel that projects beyond the line of the walls. The walls of the Madrasa measure exactly 242 feet from east to west and 220 feet from north to south. The foundations and the lower courses, at least, of the building are all jointed with thin sheets of lead. The tower (minar) has been faced with enameled tiles of different colours in zig zag lines round the lower half of it. Portions of the walls, especially in the front have also been covered with the same materials, and a broad frieze along the top of the front wall has been inscribed with sentences from Q'uran in coloured letters on a ground of green and gold. Of this a part is still to be seen on the right side of the front. The building has a high basement but to make the approach convenient, two terraces have been built in front of it. The main entrance has vanished, but its floor has been exposed during excavations. Beyond the entrance there was a portico, square in plant at the base, measuring 15 ft. 4 inches each way. The minaret at the northern and of the fa√ßade and the wall adjoining it towards the south are comparatively the best preserved portions of the Madrasa although their tile decoration and trellis work have survived only in fragments. The minaret has on octagonal base with round shape at the point. The lower has three storey, the first and second having balconies which project from the main body of the tower in a curvilinear form but have no brackets to support them.ASI, Dharwad Circle Due to the shiny nature of coloured tiles on the minar, local people call the monument as ‚Ä≥Kaanchina Khamba‚Ä≥ (Kannada; Kaanch=Glass, Khamba=Tower) History Front of the madrasa In the reign of Muhammad Shah Bahamani II (1463-1482), Khwaja Mahmud Geelani (better known as Mahmud Gawan), an old noble who bore the title of Maliku't-Tujar built the Madrasa of which the remains still exist. In the time of Firishta, nearly a century and a half later, it was still in perfect preservation and with the great mosque and other buildings by the same founder, in what was called Gawan-ki Chowk (present day Gawan Chowk) were then still applied to the purpose for which they were originally designed. In 1635, during the wars of Aurangzeb, Bidar was ravaged by Khan Dauran. In the end of 1656, it was invested by Aurangzeb himself. The historians of this time describes ‚Ä≥he entered the city and proceeding to a mosque which had been built 200 years before, in the reign of Bahamani Sultans, he caused the Kutba to be read in the name of his father Emperor Shah Jahan. After this capture, the madrasa was principally appropriated as barrack for a body of cavalry, while a room (or rooms) near the left Minar were used to store gunpowder which exploded in an accident. It blew up fully of one-fourth of the edifice, destroying the tower and entrance. It is also recorded in history that the structure suffered significant damage following a lightning struck in 1696. Significance The madrasa however, built to reaffirm Shiaism as the state religion, is clearly modeled on contemporary central Asian buildings. The entire campus gives the grand impression which Islamic architecture awakes in many minds. Intelligent planning and construction have gone into building the madrasa. The surface treatment is composed of color produced by glazed tiles of different hues. Traces of exquisite colorful tiles are still visible on the walls of the building. The floral decor, arabesque design and decorative inscriptions with arches dominating everywhere make it a fine specimen of Islamic architecture. This was all possible because Mahmud Gawan was familiar with renowned colleges at Samarkhand and Khorasan. The building contains lecture halls, a laboratory, a mosque, students‚Äô hostel, dining room, quarters for teaching faculty. This religious seminary which also taught science and maths was run by a carefully chosen faculty which comprised Islamic scholars, scientists, philosophers and Arabic experts. It is recorded that free boarding, lodging and education to over 500 students from the world over was provided at any given time. The founder had established a library of 3000 volumes in this university before his death; what became of it is not known. Preservation The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) took up the programme to preserve and protect ancient monuments in Bidar district in 2005. It included marking boundaries around these structures, building aesthetically designed compound walls, providing lighting and laying gardens around some monuments. Bidar has found its place in the World Monument Watch List,2014 which gives some hope for improvements in this City of Whispering Monuments. = Concerns = Today goats graze among the majestic ruins and the windows with exquisite jail-work look out like haunted eyes. According to an estimate, there are nearly 100 historic monuments in and around Bidar. Mahmud Gawan Madarasa is among the monuments in Bidar that require round-the-clock watch. The Archaeology office is understaffed. Plans of developing park around the madarsa has not yet realised. The open space behind the monument is used as cricket ground by locals, with the ball(s) often hitting the monument. Trivia *On 8 March 2015, A huge old tree in front of the monument was uprooted due to hours of wind, heavy rain and thunderstorms. The tree was believed to be more than a century old.

It administers both the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Dijon and the Auditorium de Dijon which are its main performance venues. In addition to operas, the organization also stages ballets and classical music concerts. History Jacques Cellerier's 1787 plan for Dijon's first purpose-built theatre and opera house Opera had been performed in Dijon by travelling opera troupes from the 17th century, although the city did not have its own theatre. The performances were given in privately owned and often ramshackle gambling dens and jeu de paume courts known as tripots. In 1717, the city acquired one of them (the tripot des Barres) with the intention of creating a municipal performing venue. The Salle de Com√©die, as it was called by 1743, remained Dijon's main theatrical venue until 1828, with seating only installed in 1817. Prior to that, the audience had watched the performances standing up.L√©v√™que, Pierre (1996). La C√¥te-d'Or: de la Pr√©histoire √† nos jours, p. 236. Editions Bourdessoules The Dijon architect Jacques Cellerier first proposed the construction of a new theatre to replace the Salle de Com√©die in 1787. The demolition of the Sainte-Chapelle church and its cloister in 1802 freed up land in the city centre and plans began in earnest for a purpose-built municipal theatre and opera house. Cellerier formally submitted his plans in 1803. The first stone was laid in 1810, but construction was halted between 1814 and 1823. The building was finally completed in 1828 and inaugurated as the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Dijon.Noellat, Jean-Baptiste (1822). Guide du voyageur et de l'amateur √† Dijon, pp. 267‚Äì269.

A second and larger municipal auditorium and concert hall was constructed in 1998, and in 2001 a new organization called Duo Dijon was set up to administer both the Grand Th√©√¢tre and the Auditorium and to become a production company in its own right rather than relying on touring productions and performers. Its first General Director was Olivier Desbordes who held the post until 2007.

Leading to a bank run on the Asia Wealth Bank, the crisis quickly spread to all major private banks in the country.\\"The World Factbook\\". Retrieved 10 March 2015.

Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law. Rangoon: State Law and Order Restoration Council, 1990. By early 2003, there were 20 private banks in the country. However, many of these banks were relatively small. Five private banks dominated the field: Asia Wealth Bank, Yoma Bank, Kanbawza Bank, Myanmar Mayflower Bank and the Myanmar Oriental Bank. Though not all private banks grew considerably by international standards, the growth of the private banking sector and the share of the deposits in private banks increased in the 1990s and early 2000s.Tumell, S. R. ‚ÄúMyanmar‚Äôs Banking Crises‚Äù. ASEAN Economic Bulletin, Vol 20 (3), December 2003.

However, while the importance of private banks in Myanmar did increase in this period, there were multiple indicators that suggested the private banks did not truly perform optimally.Economic Intelligence Unit. Myanmar (Burma), Country Report May 2003. London: Economist Intelligence Unit, 2003 For example, outside of certain urban centres such as Yangon and Mandalay, the banking system did not penetrate the lives of the populace.Economist Intelligence Unit. Myanmar (Burma), Country Profile 2002. London: Economist Intelligence Unit, 2002, p.32 For the majority of the population, keeping wealth in form tangibles (such as gold or other precious metals) and borrowing from private moneylenders were still the norm. Also, though entrance to the market was available after 1990, the banks still had to work under wide-ranging regulations; including ceilings on interest rates. The fact that these ceilings were below the inflation rate of Myanmar led to ‚Äúschemes (especially in real estate) whose principle promise was to act as an inflation hedge,‚Äù which ultimately resulted in real estate price bubbles and financial instability even before the 2003 crises.Turnell (2003), p. 273 Origins of the crisis In the second half of 2002, many informal finance enterprises in the country started to go under. These enterprises were not authorized deposit taking institutions under the Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law, but nevertheless accepted deposits by using the loophole of naming the depositors ‚Äúshareholders.‚ÄùTurnell (2003), p. 274 They promised investors considerably higher interest rates than what private banks were offering (usually around 10% per year.).Min Zin. ‚ÄúNo End to the Mess? Financial Panic in Myanmar‚Äù. The Irrawaddy online edition, October 2002. Available at: http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=2765&page;=1 While these high rates, regularly reaching 3-4% per month, seemed hardly possible to return on a sustainable basis, large amount of investors used these entities nevertheless. More often than not, the enterprises depended on either highly speculative investments for the promised rate of return or even sometimes turned out to be not much more than ponzi schemes. Nevertheless, the collapse of the informal finance companies is considered one of the early triggers of the crises. Not only were some of the authorized banks experienced direct financial loss because of exposure to these enterprises through lending and share investments,Turnell, S and Vicary A. ‚ÄúBurma‚Äôs Banking Crisis: A Commentary‚Äù Burma Economic Watch, 6 March 2003. Available at: http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/BEW2003-03.htm it also brought about distrust in the still newly liberalized financial sector. Kanbawza Bank Another source of rumors and distrust that laid at the origins of the 2003 crises were allegations of money laundering against Myanmar banks. With the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the issue of money laundering gained prominence. In response to this, in May 2002, Myanmar adopted the Law to Control Money and Property Obtained by Illegal Means. This law addressed many concerns of the US State Department and initially lead to a flight of funds from banks in Myanmar. In fact, the situation got serious enough that the government had to assure the banks that they should not be threatened by the new law. Yet, even though the flight of funds did seem to decrease, rumors of large-scale withdrawals persisted. These rumors furthermore undermined the trust to the financial system and brought about fears regarding liquidity of the banks in the face of withdrawn funds.Turnell (2003), p.274 Finally, on 1 February 2003, Finance and Revenue Minister Khin Maung Thein was permitted to retire without any additional explanation from the government. This incident coincided with the peak of fears regarding the independent finance companies‚Äô instability. The Yangon-based business magazine Living Color also ran a report in its February edition that private banks are also giving out loans well beyond their existing capital. Article specifically alleged that Asia Wealth Bank, the largest private bank in the country, has 50 times more outstanding loans than its capital while Yoma Bank has about 30 times more than its revenues.The Irrawaddy. ‚ÄúBurma‚Äôs Private Banking Crisis ‚Äì a Chronology‚Äù, The Irrawaddy online edition, December 2003. Available at: http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7687&page;=1 Similarly, a rumor indicating that Asia Wealth Bank lost a significant amount of its investments in deals with a Chinese company also started circulating. All these issues led to rumors that major banks are on the verge of collapse and created the ground for the crises. Timeline On February 6, fears about the private banks collapsing led to bank runs by customers to withdraw their funds. Starting with Asia Wealth Bank, the runs quickly spread to other private banks. As early as February 10, the situation got dire enough that Kyaw Kyaw Maung, the governor of Myanmar's Central Bank, held a press conference assuring that all 20 banks are in firm financial standing and have the backing of the Central Bank. However, this attempt was not enough to quell the consumer unrest. Different banks started to begin denying withdrawal requests and asked account holders to return after February 18. By February 12, reserves of Asia Wealth Bank dwindled to a point where the bank asked the Central Bank a security bond of 30 billion kyats (US$30 million.) Finally, on 15 February, Yoma Bank, one of the three banks in the country that have credit card services, suspended such services in the face of the crises. Yoma Bank, one of the three banks that had credit card services in 2003 With the financial situation getting worse, there were reports that the ruling party got increasingly sensitive about business reporting in the country, imposing a news blackout in an effort to stop the spread of panic among the public.The Economist. ‚ÄúKyatastrophe‚Äù, The Economist, 20 March 2003. Available at: http://www.economist.com/node/1650080 The state-owned Kyemon newspaper ran a story that blamed the destructive elements abroad, such as the exiles, for the banking crises. By February 17, all private banks started to impose a withdrawal limit of 500,000 kyat ($500) per customer per week in order to tackle the liquidity problem. Within a week, this limit got further tightened to 200,000 and 100,00 kyat for some banks. Universal Bank decreased this limit to 50,000 kyat per week by February 21.Turnell (2003), p.275 In response to the limits, large crowds began gathering in front banks demanding withdrawals. After a bank in Yangon's Thingangyun area was stoned by account holders, riot police was called upon to guard banks, while the traffic police tried to disperse the huge crowds outside of the Olympic Tower branch of Asia Wealth Bank. Soon, Asia Wealth Bank posted signs saying their branches are working in normal conditions, even though the restrictions were still in place. Central Bank of Myanmar seal On February 20, several banks ordered their investors to repay about 20% to 25% of their loans to the bank within a few days. By some accounts, this was asked by the Central Bank of Myanmar. This led to further hardship for customers, where, in one geographic division, people who borrowed for purchasing homes were asked to return 25% of their loans back. Though there is no exact data on what followed, there is contemporary reporting that suggests people had to \\"sell assets or downgrade their business and lifestyles‚Äù in order to meet these loan calls. By February 25, some banks revised their earlier demands for 25% of the outstanding loans repayments to 50%. The Central Bank of Myanmar‚Äôs timetable initially required that all required repayments were to be paid by the end of March 2003. General Khin Nyunt, on March 29 said in a press conference that he ‚Äúwould like to urge those who have taken loans from the banks to strive to repay their debts speedily in consideration of those who have deposited money in the banks, and to ensure the long term interest of the banks and strengthen the national economy\\". However, the deadline later got pushed back to May 2003 as a lot of the recalled debt was not paid back. Even by the end of May, there were still repayment orders that were not fulfilled. On February 21, the Central Bank pledged to assist private banks with a 25 billion kyat ($25 million) bailout, at 4% interest rate. The money was going to be shared between the three largest private banks: Asia Wealth Bank, Kanbawza Bank and Yoma Bank. This liquidity support represented about 3.5% of all deposits in these banks.Turnell (2003), p.276 However, according to the Irrawaddy Newspaper, this money have never actually arrived to these banks.Naw Seng. \\"Yoma Selling Capital Assets\\", The Irrawaddy, 13 May 2003, online edition. Available at: http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=1241 Though the reports on the crises have been limited outside of the country due to the media blackout, by the end of February, a Singapore-based business magazine wrote that they are watching the crises with concern and one firm has already closed down operations in Yangon. Yet, on February 24, Zaw Win Naing, the managing director of Kanbawza Bank said: ‚Äúthe problem we face can be worked out soon, and it is a temporary problem.‚Äù Yet, even by May 2003, the crises did not seem to dwindle and depositors had no greater ability to access their accounts. Three month into the banking crises, all three biggest banks were facing severe cash shortages. Yoma bank was reportedly selling its capital assets in order to raise liquidity. OutcomesValue of Kyat= Though in many instances banking and currency crises happens together,Turnell (2003), p. 275 the value of the kyat appreciated during the banking crises. With the currency losing value against to dollar before the crises, reaching the low of 1100 kyat for $1, by February 20 the value of kyat increased to 900 kyat for $1 (the black market rate). On March 18, moneychangers in Yangon reported that trading was happening at as low as 850 kyat 1000 kyat bill As kyat was indispensable for everyday transactions for the people in Myanmar, there was a steady demand for it even before the crises. With the crises making kyat- denominated bank deposits overly risky and virtually worthless (due to frozen accountsMin Zin. \\"Bank Crisis Rolls On\\". The Irrawaddy online edition,7 May 2003. Available at: http://www.irrawaddy.org/art/2003 and illiquidity of the banks) the demand for the kyat increased and supply of kyat decreased. The kyat inevitably increased in price as it became scarcer. Economist Elliot Turner also notes that this scarcity of kyat was indicative of systemic illiquidity in the entire system due to the banking crises. =Economic Hardship= With the withdrawal limits in place, and the other means of exchange used by banks such as cheques, remittance facilities, credit cards and electronic transfers of funds severely disrupted, the crises had harmful effects on the real economy.Kyaw Zwa Moe. \\"Crisis Forces Businesses to Close, Crime to Rise\\", The Irrawaddy, 17 March 2003, online edition. Available at: http://www2.irrawaddy.org/opinion_story.php?art_id=1179 On February 26, the Central Bank ordered all banks to cease any account transfers, further exacerbating the issue. Though majority of the people in Myanmar did not have bank accounts, almost all businesses had and used these funds to pay their employees. From the offset of the crises, many workers and employers in Myanmar in market related activities such as factories, fisheries and construction faced severe cuts in payments. In fact, there are reports that suggest many workers went unpaid for weeks or got laid off due to the crises. Similarly, contractors, transport providers for goods, suppliers and distributors were all affected by the crises. On February 28, some traders were saying they were unable to make due payments to other merchants since their money remained tied in bank accounts. Even though some business account holders were allowed to make larger withdrawals to pay salaries in late February, small accounts and personal investments still were disrupted. The Mizzima News Service have reported on March 2 that due to bank closures in Tamu, close to the Indian-Burma border, have resulted in losses for the traders and of payments in the area. This led to a meeting by border traders on March 13 in Tamu, discussing solutions to the ongoing problem Burmese traders with India have demanded that government should deal with this crises.Mizzima News. ‚ÄúBank Crisis Takes Tolls on Traders in India and Burma‚Äù, Mizzima News, 13 March 2003. Available at: http://burmatoday.net/mizzima/030313_bank_mizzima_e.htm Day-to-day operations of agricultural trading firms are also harmed, as the firms could not pay their current debt obligations. In mid-March, people in Yangon started to sell luxury items to meet their due payments to the banks. However, with the crises ongoing, demand for good were low and prices of certain goods had to fall down as much as 50 percent. According to the Irawaddy newspaper, number of robberies in the area also increased due to the banking crises. By May 2003, a secondary market of frozen bank accounts started to emerge, where account holders were selling their frozen accounts for about 60% to 80% of their face value, further increasing the financial losses for account owners.

It was developed by the KMDB of the Malyshev Factory and never put into full production.  Development history  After the adoption of the T-80 tank, the Soviets started on improving its design. The work was done by two design bureaus; the KMDB of Malyshev Plant designed the \\"Object 478\\" prototype, and the design office of the LKZ designed the \\"Object 219\\" prototype. The Kharkov version of the modernized T-80 chassis involved equipping Object 219 with a 6TD-1 1000 horsepower diesel engine as well as installing a new combat compartment being developed for the modernization of the T-64A under the designation of Object 476. In 1976, this project was carried out on the machine, but further work on it was not continued as the main focus at the time was on the gas turbine engine. After the death of Defence Minister Dmitry Ustinov, the strength of the design bureau of the LKZ began to weaken and the Ministry of Defense started to think seriously about equipping the T-80 tanks with diesel engines. Work on equipping the T-80 tanks with diesel engines was carried out by several design offices. The Omsk Transport Engineering Design Bureau was tasked to equip the T-80 with the B-46-6 engine (this tank received the designation \\"Object 644\\"). KB-3 of the LKZ was also tasked to equip the T-80 with the 2B-16-2 engine, but both projects failed. At the same time, work was intensified on the creation of the Object 478 tank.

The cemetery has 1,600 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Louis Mountbatten described the battle fought at Imphal and Kohima as \\"probably one of the greatest battles in history\\". In 2013, the Battle of Kohima and Imphal was voted as one of the greatest battles in history, based on a national survey conducted by the National Army Museum. Location The cemetery is located in Imphal, in a small locality of Dewlahland away from the Imphal International Airport. It is approachable from the Imphal-Dimapur Highway 39, through a branch road which is about to the right of the high way and in front of the DM college. Daily air services operate from Calcutta, Guwahati and Delhi. The road distance from Imphal to Kohima is to its north and to Silchar is to its west. Regular buses operate between Guwahati in Assam to Imphal. There is no rail network in Manipur. History During the Second World War, in 1942 the Japanese Army occupied Burma by defeating the Commonwealth forces. They then reinforced their strategic strength in Burma and used it as the \\"staging ground\\" for attack on Imphal and then Assam with the intention of containing the Chinese air operations across the Himalayas. After the defeat in Burma, the British army divisions had retreated to Imphal in India as it was the easiest route from Burma. Indian diaspora in Burma, of nearly 400,000 people, also fled to India, out of which nearly 140,000 are reported to have reached Assam via Imphal. The British then reinforced the army infrastructure at Imphal by forming the 23rd Indian Division stationed in Manipur, new airfields were built, Commonwealth forces were reinforced with more army and air force units, and a general hospital also started functioning from November 1944. Considering Imphal‚Äôs strategic importance, the Japanese forces attacked Manipur in the spring of 1944. The Japanese started bombing Imphal, severed a part of the road link between Imphal and Dimapur and held siege over Imphal for over three months. The 14th Army of the Commonwealth Forces fought fiercely and caused many casualties of the Japanese forces. The siege of Imphal was lifted in the summer of 1944. The battle ended on 22 June 1944 when British and Indian troops from Kohima and Imphal met at Milestone 109. This battle is considered next only to the Battle of Kohima. For the Japanese army the control over Imphal, in the \\"bloody plains\\" was very expensive in terms of casualties as nearly 50,000 of their soldiers died here. This battle has been termed as the \\"Normandy of the east\\". It is reported that during the Second World War, the number of dead in the Kohima and Imphal sectors in India, put together, was 65,000 Japanese troops and 18,000 British and Indian soldiers. Features Initially, the cemetery had 950 burials of war dead. Following the end of the Second World War, the burials in two other smaller cemeteries in Imphal and in other isolated locations were also shifted to this cemetery taking the total war burials at the cemetery to 1,600. The memorial has markers with brass plaques with the name of each of the fallen. The war dead commemorated are from many commonwealth countries, such as 1300 from the United Kingdom, 10 from Canada, 5 from Australia, 220 from India, 40 from East Africa, 10 from West Africa and 10 from Burma. Visitor Information Panels have been proposed for display at the memorial. This display, which incorporates a smartphone technology, enables access to information about the battle at Imphal and also personal stories of some of those who are commemorated in the cemetery; 500 such panels were proposed to be installed in 2014. Memorial service A memorial service was organized at the cemetery on the occasion of the 70th Anniversary of the Battle of Imphal (WWII) on 27 June 2014. V.K. Duggal, the Governor of Manipur, the Deputy Chief Minister of Manipur, Director, Commonwealth War Grave Commission, the First Secretary, Australian High Commission to India, Military Attache in the Embassy of United States, Chairman and Members of the Manipur Tourism Forum and 2nd World War Imphal Campaign Foundation were the dignitaries present on the occasion.

A full-sister to the European champion Dancing Brave, she proved herself one of the best three-year-old fillies in the world in 1992, winning the Prix de Diane and Prix Vermeille on turf in Europe before running third on dirt against male opposition in the Breeders' Cup Classic. She was permanently transferred to the United States in the following year but won only one minor race in four attempts. She was then retired to become a broodmare in Kentucky, where her record as a producer of winners was moderate. She died in 2005 at the age of sixteen. Background Jolypha was a bay mare with a white star bred in Kentucky by Juddmonte Farms, the breeding arm of the Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah's racing organisation. She was sired by Lyphard, an American-bred stallion who raced in France, winning the Prix Jacques Le Marois and Prix de la For√™t in 1972. Lyphard became a very successful breeding stallion in both Europe and North America, siring Three Troikas, Dancing Brave, Dancing Maid and Manila. Jolypha's dam, Navajo Princess, won sixteen races including the Molly Pitcher Handicap. Navajo Princess was a descendant of the mare Stolen Kiss, who was the ancestor of notable racehorses including the Epsom Derby winner Henbit and the Kentucky Derby winner Lucky Debonair. Navajo Princess had achieved renown as a broodmare by producing Jolypha's full brother Dancing Brave. the filly was sent to race in France where she was trained by Andr√© Fabre. Racing career1992: three-year-old season= Jolypha did not race as a two-year-old, making her debut in the Prix Dorina over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 25 April 1992 and winning by a length from La Sarcelle. A month later she was moved up in class to contest the Group One Prix Saint Alary over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which she was ridden for the first time by Pat Eddery, who partnered her in all her remaining races in 1992. She turned into the straight in eighth place, before making progress and finished second, a short head behind her stablemate Rosefinch and a head in front of the Prix du Calvados winner Verveine. On 14 June, Jolypha was one of twelve fillies to contest the 143rd running of the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. Rosefinch and Verveine were again in opposition along with Urban Sea, Garendare (winner of the Prix Cl√©op√¢tre), Oumaldaaya (Lupe Stakes), Sheba Dancer (Prix Vanteaux) and Guislaine (Prix d'Aumale). Jolypha took the lead from Oumaldaaya 400 metres from the finish and won by a length and a short head from Sheba Dancer and Verveine. After a three-month break, Jolypha returned in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp on 13 September and started the 8/5 favourite. Verveine and Urban Sea were among her opponents, whilst the other contenders included Market Booster (Pretty Polly Stakes), Linnga (Prix Minerve) and Cunning (Galtres Stakes). Jolypha entered the straight in sixth place and briefly struggled to obtain a clear run before producing a strong finish to overtake Cunning in the last strides to win by a head. Urban Sea took third ahead of Verveine and Market Booster. On 4 October, Jolypha contested France's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She was restrained towards the rear of the field before making some progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished eighth of the eighteen runners behind Subotica. Four weeks later, the filly was sent to the United States to contest the ninth running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, run that year at Gulfstream Park in Florida. She was the only three-year-old filly in the race and started a 16/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field. After racing in seventh place for much of the way she made steady progress in the straight and finished third behind A.P. Indy and Pleasant Tap. Her third-place finish remains the best by a three-year-old filly in the race, and was the best by any female horse until Zenyatta finished second in 2010. =1993: four-year-old season= In 1993, Jolypha was relocated to the United States where she was trained by Robert J. Frankel. She won on her seasonal debut, taking an allowance race over eight and a half furlongs on turf at Hollywood Park Racetrack in May and then looked unlucky in running when finishing second to Flawlessly in the Grade I Beverly D. Stakes over the same track a month later. She finished sixth of the seven runners behind Flawlessly in the Ramona Handicap at Del Mar racetrack in August and was then matched against male opposition in the Goodwood Handicap on dirt at Santa Anita Park in October, finishing fourth behind Lottery Winner. Breeding record Jolypha was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Juddmonte Farms. She produced eleven foals, four of whom won minor races, between 1995 and 2005. *Eaton Square, a bay colt, foaled in 1995, sired by Nureyev. Won two races. *Cosh, brown filly, 1996, by A.P. Indy. Unraced. *Seek the Light, bay colt (later gelded), 1997, by Seeking The Gold.

The affair had political, academic and diplomatic fallout. Beginnings of the controversy In March 2015, media reports appeared showing email messages sent by German Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger, the head of the biochemistry department at Leipzig University, to an anonymous male internship applicant from India. According to the released email texts, Beck-Sickinger does not accept ‚Äúany Indian male students for internships‚Äù, and ‚Äúmany female professors in Germany decided to no longer accept male Indian students‚Äù. She references India's \\"rape problem\\" as the reason for not accepting any Indian male applicant for internships. Beck-Sickinger has described the released text as taken out of context but says she \\"made a mistake\\" in the incident. Subsequently, an additional anonymous Indian student released emails that appeared to show similar commentary made by Beck-Sickinger in 2014. The alleged messages were publicly condemned in an open letter from German ambassador to India Michael Steiner. The incident occurred shortly before a scheduled official visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the invitation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. = First disclosure = Reports alleging that a university professor in Germany does not accept ‚Äúany Indian male students for internships‚Äù, and that ‚Äúmany female professors in Germany decided to no longer accept male Indian students‚Äù surfaced on social media in early March 2015. Screen-shots of e-mails, allegedly sent by Annette Beck-Sickinger of the Institute of Biochemistry at Leipzig University, appeared to show that she explained her actions by reference to India's 'culture of rape'.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning- mix/wp/2015/03/09/german-professor-triggers-controversy-by-citing-indias-rape- problem-in-e-mail-to-rejected-indian-applicant/ German professor cites India‚Äôs ‚Äòrape problem‚Äô in rejection of Indian applicant (Washington Post) News reports stated that Huffington Post India contacted Prof. Beck-Sickinger who confirmed that the e-mails were real but insists that they were taken out of context. On 9 March 2015, the German ambassador to India, Michael Steiner, rebuked Beck- Sickinger's opinions as oversimplified and discriminative. Steiner's apology contrasted that of the rector of Leipzig University,Biochemie-Professorin Annette Beck-Sickinger entschuldigt sich f√ºr √Ñu√üerungen (University Leipzig) German Professor Beate Sch√ºcking, who offered support for Beck-Sickinger's apology: ‚ÄúHer comments on the issue of violence against women in India were not her first answer but were made in reply to a provocative e-mail which followed the initial e-mail. To say it clearly: I do not tolerate these comments. However, I accept Professor Beck-Sickinger's apology. And I can say: the published e-mail has obviously been faked.‚Äù.India's 'rape problem' a problem for Leipzig University (Deutsche Welle) 10 March 2015 Beate Sch√ºcking refused to speculate about consequences because the issue was currently being reviewed internally by her office and the Council of Deans and would be subject to review by the Academic Senate. Besides Prof. Sch√ºcking, the students council of the Leipzig University had the chance to review all relevant e-mails. A statement was published saying that the student was rejected for formal reasons and in reply to the refusal, the student provoked a discussion about social and cultural problems in India. The mail which was initially published by the student is claimed to be fake, or a \\"mashup\\", though in earlier press reports the professor herself is reported to have confirmed that the mail is not a hoax. While Leipzig University has declined to release the full text of the emails due to privacy issues, it released a statement in which it explained that the applicant had been rejected because there were no further internship openings, but had continued to converse with Beck-Sickinger by email. Beck-Sickinger released a statement in which she apologized for the incident, said she had \\"made a mistake\\", and pointed out that Indian students were members of both her research group and the internship program, but did not specify their genders. = Second disclosure = In the wake of the incident, a second anonymous Indian man alleged that he also had previously been rejected by Beck-Sickinger as a PhD candidate in early 2014. These emails allegedly contained the text: The university responded to the second set of allegations, saying that Beck-Sickinger had deleted the message in question and that she denies having responded as claimed. Reactions Political= Junior minister of the Indian Government, Minister of State for External Affairs (Independent Charge) V. K. Singh, said that the incident was the result of \\"misunderstanding\\" of India and hoped that the matter could be resolved at the earliest. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Tariq Anwar said: ‚ÄúIf such comment has been made, then it is condemnable. The Government of Germany should take cognizance of this and whosoever has said this, investigation should be done against that person. Such incidents only spoil the relations between two nations,‚ÄùWegen Inder-Sperre: Leipziger Professorin ruft Au√üenministerium auf den Plan (Focus) German The political response to the incident in Germany was muted despite the global media coverage. Saxony Regional Minister of Science, Eva-Maria Stange, said: ‚ÄúI assume that Professor Beck-Sickinger had no intention to hurt the feelings of the Indian students.‚Äù =Diplomatic= German ambassador to India Michael Steiner responded to the incident with an open letter, excerpted below, addressed to Beck-Sickinger. :‚ÄúYour oversimplifying and discriminating generalisation is an offence to women and men ardently committed to furthering women's empowerment in India; and is an offence to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians. Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists,‚Äù :‚ÄúThe 2012 Nirbhaya rape case has refocused attention on the issue of violence against women. Rape is indeed a serious issue in India as in most countries, including Germany. In India, the Nirbhaya case has triggered lively, honest, sustained and very healthy public debate - a public debate of a quality that wouldn't be possible in many other countries,‚Äù. :‚ÄúI would encourage you to learn more about the diverse, dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of India so that you could correct a simplistic image, which ‚Äì in my opinion ‚Äì is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher.‚Äù. = Academic = The incident gave rise to commentaries by European academics who scrutinized the underlying issues raised by the incident: persistence of a colonial mind-set in Europe, an anti-Indian bias in European media, the philosophical justification for an indiscriminate academic embargo, an overview of sex related crimes in Europe, and the human rights situation in Germany with regard to discrimination and treatment of minority groups in Germany. * A professor in Germany is a civil servant of the German state. Is it suitable for a civil servant of the German state to be openly racist? \\\\- Benjamin Zachariah, Historian, University of Heidelberg, Germany * India and the West could together look for solutions to the problems that we share. Instead, Western commentators reproduce old colonial stories about India as an immoral culture. This gives them a twisted relationship to the Indian people. On the one hand, they keep turning towards the same class of Indian journalists, activists, and intellectuals for ‚Äòlocal knowledge‚Äô. But these native informants merely talk the talk of the West to the West. On the other hand, more and more Indians are disgusted by the West‚Äôs condescending attitude towards their country. And this is then dismissed as hurt pride. If we want to bring our two peoples and cultures closer together in this new age, reason and empathy are our only hope. The madness of the current discourse about India must end. India‚Äôs Daughter and BBC ‚Äì Belgian Professor speaks out (Jakob De Roover, University of Ghent, Belgium) \\\\- Jakob De Roover, University of Ghent, Belgium Ranjan Ghosh, a lecturer at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences at Uppsala, and who formerly taught in Germany opined that the incident was most likely an isolated incident. Ranjan Ghosh acknowledged that despite regulations against any racial prejudice being stringent in Germany, after the Nirbhaya case, Indians are increasingly confronted with questions about India's rape situation. The incident is seen as a fallout from biased views of India in Western media and comes on the heels of the controversy surrounding the release of the BBC documentary film about the 2012 Delhi gang rape called India's Daughter. = Social Media = Social media called upon university authorities in Germany to offer an unconditional apology.German Racism meets German Sanctimony over India‚Äôs Daughter (Niti Central) Public response in India, whilst unanimous in condemning Beck-Sickinger's comments and allegations of an academic boycott, were also severely critical of efforts undertaken by the government to prevent horrendous crimes, including rapes, in India.

Cole Fairbanks City Hall, also known as Main School and Old Main for its previous use as a school building, is located at 800 Cushman Street in downtown Fairbanks, Alaska. An Art Deco concrete building, it was built in 1934 to replace the original Fairbanks school, a wooden building constructed in 1907 which burned down in late 1932. As Fairbanks grew exponentially with the military buildup associated with World War II and the Cold War, the building was enlarged in 1939 and again in 1948. It was the city's only school from its opening in 1934 until the opening of Denali Elementary School in 1951. It became a junior/senior high school for several years until Lathrop High School began operation. The school then became Main Junior High School until it was replaced by Ryan Junior High School and Tanana Junior High School during the early 1970s. Following the disestablishment of Main Junior High, instruction in the building was mostly limited to alternative education programs. The building's primary purpose at that point was to house the administrative offices of the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, a role it filled from 1976 until 1993. Most of those offices moved to the school district's current Fifth Avenue headquarters in the mid 1980s, and the building sat largely vacant for many years, eventually being completely abandoned. The building has housed city offices since 1994, which moved from the longtime Fairbanks City Hall three blocks to the north. In addition to city offices, the former school gymnasium is home to the Fairbanks Boys & Girls Club. Previous non-governmental tenants of the building under city ownership have included the Fairbanks Boxing Club and the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as Main School.

On March 5, 2015, the McDonnell Douglas MD-88 aircraft veered off the runway shortly after landing at LaGuardia Airport in New York City. The plane ran up the seawall berm and struck the perimeter fence, sliding along it for approximately before coming to rest with the nose of the aircraft hanging over the berm above Flushing Bay. There were no fatalities, although 24 people suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was seriously damaged and written off. The final report by the NTSB found the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's \\"inability to maintain directional control of the airplane due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplane‚Äôs heading.\\" Aircraft and crew N909DL, the MD-88 involved in the accident, photographed in January 2015, two months before the accident The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas MD-88, registration number N909DL, serial number 49540, manufactured in July 1987 and delivered new to Delta on December 30, 1987. It had accumulated 71,196 total flight hours and 54,865 total flight cycles prior to the accident. It was owned and operated by Delta ever since the aircraft was put into airline service. Regularly scheduled 600-flight hour, 2200-flight hour, and 760-day maintenance checks were completed in the six months prior to the accident, all with no discrepancies. The aircraft's last major maintenance check was on September 22, 2014, in Jacksonville, Florida and included, among other things, tests of the autobrake, anti-skid and auto-spoiler systems. The aircraft's last overnight service check was completed March 2, 2015 in Tampa, Florida. The 56-year-old captain was a former United States Air Force pilot, who had joined Delta in August 1989. He had 15,200 flight hours, including 11,000 hours on the MD-88 and MD-90. The 46-year-old first officer had been with Delta since 2007 and had logged 11,000 flight hours, with 3,000 of them on the MD-88 and MD-90. Members of the flight crew were not publicly identified. History of the flight Flight 1086 took off from Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport at 8:45am EST, and was scheduled to land at LaGuardia Airport at 10:48 am. LaGuardia Airport was under falling snow and freezing fog conditions at the time of arrival, with the captain reportedly telling passengers that weather problems could cause a delay. Another Delta Air Lines MD-88 had landed on runway 13 about three minutes prior to flight 1086. The pilots of this preceding flight confirmed that air traffic controllers relayed the braking action reports to the flight crew of Delta 1086; these reports were based on pilot reports from two other flights that landed several minutes prior to flight 1086. Both earlier flights had reported the braking action on the runway as \\"good.\\" Statements by the pilots to the NTSB after the crash revealed that the runway appeared all white (covered with snow) when the airplane descended out of the overcast, seconds before landing. Accident LaGuardia Airport. Runway 13 starts at the bottom-center of the photo and extends towards the top left. The aircraft was approaching runway 13 to land on what appeared to be a normal final approach. The aircraft was aligned with the runway centerline, and the autopilot remained engaged until the aircraft was about above ground level, and airspeed during the final approach was about , and at touchdown. The aircraft touched down at 11:02 am with the main landing gear close to the runway centerline. The MD-88 veered off the left side of the runway shortly after touchdown, about from the approach end of the runway, on a heading approximately 10 degrees left of the runway heading. The MD-88 skidded left across the snowy airfield until about from the approach end of the runway, when the aircraft ran up the berm and the left wing struck the airport perimeter fence. It then was forced back onto a heading parallel with runway 13, and continued sliding in this direction for another along the perimeter fence, before coming to rest about from the approach end of runway 13, with the nose of the aircraft hanging over the berm. The left wing of the aircraft destroyed approximately of airport perimeter fence. The aircraft sustained significant structural damage. There was major damage to the left wing's leading edge, leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps, and spoilers. The left wing fuel tank was breached near the outboard end of the outboard flaps. The front radome and weather radar were heavily damaged, and damage to the underside of the fuselage extended from the front of the aircraft all the way back to the left front passenger door. The nose landing gear well and the main electronics bay also were damaged. Delta subsequently declared the aircraft a hull loss, making the accident the 37th hull loss of a McDonnell Douglas MD-80. The crew of the plane managed a complete evacuation only after more than 17 minutes, while the aircraft was leaking fuel. Twenty-three or twenty-four passengers received minor injuries, but all injured passengers had been sent home from the hospital by March 9, 2015. The airport was closed immediately after the accident at approximately 11:00 am. Runways were reopened beginning at 2:30 pm. Runway 13 was closed until 10:30 am the next morning as emergency services cleared the accident site and the aircraft was removed into a hangar. Among the passengers on the flight was former football player Larry Donnell. Investigation On March 6, 2015, the NTSB reported that the cockpit voice recorder was successfully downloaded, and contained two hours of good quality recordings and captured the entire flight. Also, the flight data recorder (a 25-hour tape-based recorder) was examined and found to have captured the entire flight and approximately 50 parameters of data, including airspeed, altitude, heading, and information on engines and flight controls, among other data. An NTSB meteorologist examined the weather conditions at the time of the accident, to determine if weather was a contributing factor to the accident. The NTSB also analyzed and developed the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder. NTSB investigators examined and tested the antiskid, autobrake, and thrust reverser systems on the aircraft. The autobrake selector switch in the cockpit was found in the \\"max\\" position. The tailcone handle in the main cabin had been actuated, presumably for evacuation purposes, and the rear tailcone had detached. Initial statements given by the pilots to the NTSB reveal a number of factors that may have contributed to the accident. The pilots stated they based their decision to land on braking action reports of \\"good,\\" which they received from air traffic control before landing (based on reports given by aircraft landing immediately before them). Another Delta MD-88 landed on the same runway just three minutes prior to the accident flight's landing. The runway appeared \\"all white\\" to the pilots when they broke out of the overcast, indicating it was covered with snow. The NTSB investigation found that runway snow clearing had most recently taken place about 20‚Äì25 minutes prior to the accident. Upon landing, the pilots noted that the automatic spoilers did not deploy to slow the aircraft as they should have, but the first officer quickly deployed them manually. Also, the autobrakes were set to \\"max,\\" but the pilots did not sense any wheel brake deceleration. The captain also reported that he was unable to prevent the airplane from drifting left. According to the NTSB investigation update issued on April 2, 2015, investigators found that Delta's MD-88 pilot operational materials (manuals) contained guidance recommending that pilots limit the reverse thrust engine pressure ratio (EPR) to 1.3 when landing on \\"contaminated\\" runways, i.e., runways with increased levels of risk related to deceleration and directional control. The investigation has found that the EPR was at 1.9 at six seconds after touchdown, however, based on readout from the flight data recorder. The investigation also found that, upon landing, brake pressure increased in a manner consistent with autobrake application. According to a Wall Street Journal article published March 9, 2015, \\"Pilots and air-safety experts have long known that when the MD-88s reversers are deployed, its rudder, or large vertical tail panel intended to help turn the nose, sometimes may not be powerful enough to control left or right deviations from the center of runways.\\" The final report by the NTSB found the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's \\"inability to maintain directional control of the airplane due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplane‚Äôs heading.\\" See also * American Airlines Flight 331 * Air France Flight 358 * Air India Express Flight 812 * Lion Air Flight 583 * TAM Airlines Flight 3054 * American Airlines Flight 1420 References Category:2015 in New York (state) Category:Accidents and incidents involving the McDonnell Douglas MD-88 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2015 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 2015 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in New York City 1086 Category:History of Queens, New York Category:March 2015 events in the United States Category:LaGuardia Airport Category:Aviation accidents and incidents involving runway excursions ","title":"Delta Air Lines Flight 1086"},{"id":"45635294","text":"The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) is a cabinet-level ministry of the government of Uganda.

The club has adult football, hurling and camogie teams. The Naomh Fionnbarra Hurling Football Comogie club was founded in 1945. The club has been synonymous with Gaelic Games and Irish culture for 65 years in the Cabra Area. The club was set up to promote and develop the Irish culture, language, and heritage through the medium of the GAA. It was also set up to give the young people of Cabra an important outlet and past time that cater for the boundless energy and enthusiasm that youth brings in a new area and over the last 65 years. The men who were mainly involved with the foundation of the club were Jack Casserly RIP, Joe Brady RIP, Ned Wolahan RIP, and Bill Bracken RIP. These men started by running Roads League for juveniles and later on they entered the Dublin Juvenile Leagues. The club was the first parish in Dublin to run road leagues which are still been run today. In 1946 our under 14 team reached the hurling final in the ‚Äô15 Acres‚Äô but lost. The following year we won our first trophies which were an under 15 hurling league and an under 16 football league. In the early forties men like Jack Casserly use to sell raffle tickets around the doors for fire wood to raise money for the young club. As the club grew men like Seamus Nolan became involved and the clubs enter a Junior Hurling Team. Seamus was a Waterford man who was one of the first residents on Bannow Road and the club used his house all through the fifties to hold their meetings. In 1952 the club won the junior D league, 1953 the junior C League, Smith Cup, and in 1954 they won the Miller Shield. The year 1958 the club won the B league in hurling. In 1950 another man joined the club. He put more work into the club for the next thirty years then anybody has ever done or indeed could do. He worked tireless getting juvenile teams together and there was not a house in Cabra that he had not called to in his quest for players. The man of course was Gerry Kehoe (sn). From his house in no. 4 Bannow Road he worked to get children involved in the club. From a small village in Wicklow mountains called ‚ÄúAnnacurra‚Äô, Gerry was a very good player himself. He won a Wicklow minor medal and an All Ireland junior football medal in 1938 with London. Gerry work tirelessly over many decades, holding all position in the club both on and off the pitch promoting and building the club at every level until his unexpected death at the age of 69 in 1980. Larry Kearns another great worker for the club joined Gerry and their hard work began to pay off in the late fifties and early sixties when their juveniles teams won two under 15 Hurling Leagues, 16 Hurling league and Minor Hurling and Football leagues. Indeed there is little doubt that the Juveniles teams produced by these men in the fifties and sixties were the main reason for some of our adult victories in the sixties. St Finbarrs School has always played a big part in the continual supply of player‚Äôs for the Club. As far back as 1943 when the school teams became the first Primary school to win the Hurling and Football in the same year. They have since won many trophies and this was due to the great interest show by Maurice Mc Auliffe, Paddy Ban O Brion and Dessie Ryan. In 1958 the club started a Camogie section and this was run by Jim Byrne and his wife Maureen Byrne.They won an Intermediate Championship in 1958. The club was always considered to be more hurling than football, so it came as a surprise to many that our first adult Championship victory came in football. This was when the junior footballers won the Junior Championship and Junior A League in 1961. The team won a Championship in 1962 and the Camogie section lasted up until 1968. Under the management of Joe Brady, John Myles, Ned Wolahan, the team beat the mighty St Vincent in Parnell Park. This was the start of what would be called the Golden decade as the club won a number of championships and leagues to go both senior Hurling and Football in a 12 year period. In 1966 the football team won their way into senior ranks by winning the inter football Championship. The Junior Hurlers made the big break through in 1965 by winning the junior Hurling league and championship. In 1968 our under 13 footballers was beaten in the A league final and this team would be the back bone of the Cabra west team who won three consecutive community games Gold medals in Croke Park. In 1969 they won the double in inter championship and league. The Hurlers won the senior hurling league in 1970 to get the decade off to a strong start. In 1971 they won the senior hurling league again. In the 73, 74 ,75 season the club team won a number of juvenile leagues in under 12, 13 and 14 but lost our senior football status in 1976. It was at this time that the club went through a lean period but it was at this time that the seeds would be planted for the club's future development. With the work of committees still being done by some of the older members like Gerry Kehoe, Seamus Nolan, Nancy Keogh and John Myles (sn) a number of younger members took more interest in the workings of the club and its teams. Mick Brown, Timmy Mullane, Phil Lynch, Joe Glynn, Madaline Kehoe,Paddy Keogh, Joe Casserly, Willy McAuley,Sean Myles (sn), Hughie Flanagan, Gerry Kehoe (jn) Mary Myles and Johnnie Smithers Nicky Kehoe Mick Hopkins. The club had always a great desire to get its own club house and in 1961 a development committee was set up to achieved this Gerry Kehoe (sn), Donal Massey and Paddy Dillon club chairman. They were offered a piece of land behind the church on Killkearnan Road but hadn‚Äôt the money at the time to develop. In 1974 the club committee approached the city council to build a club house on the site of Bogies that now houses the community centre. They were refused and this further restricted the club's development in the seventies. In 1978 Gerry Kehoe (sn) was the club's representative on the old Cabra community council and the issue of Charleville House came up on the agenda. It was proposed to knock it down as both the Legion of Mary and the Pigeon Club had been using it and due to vandalism they had to leave the building. Gerry Kehoe proposed to the council that the club would take it over. This was put to the club executive who gave the permission and this would be the club's premises for the next 16 years. From this move would come the foundation for the new club house in the nineties. The year 1983 will go down as one of the most successful years in our club history, when our hulers won the league, Championship and Doyle cup in a two month period. This team was manage by Philly Lynch, Timmy Mullane and Phelim Brady. In 1984 the footballers having won the city inter league lost out in a play off with St Anne‚Äôs by a point to go to the final to go senior. In 1983 the club formed a Camogie team for the second time. Jackie McKeogh and a number of the women put in a junior Camogie team which resulted in a Camogie section being set up in 1985. Jackie McKeogh, Eilish Langan, Eileen Farrell,and Orla Langan Kim McKeogh were all involved in getting this section up and running. At this time in the mid eighties a number of young people became involved in running the teams and working on the committees. Joe Lyons, Tommy Mc Donagh, Peter Fizgearld, Mick Ward, Ray O‚ÄôReilly, Shane McGill, Vincent Kehoe, Declan Fagan, Kenneth Broughan, Paul McManus, Hugh Flanagan, Seamus Kehoe, Paul Turner, Stephen Morgan, John Morgan (jn), Tomo Kelly, Jimmy Fagan, Robert Brady, Paul Farrell, Thomas ‚ÄòBig Mac‚Äô Mc Donald, Anto Keogh (snr), Tony Smith, Terry McKeogh and Anthony ‚ÄòGossey‚Äò Costello. On the playing fields the senior hurlers in 1985 reached the quarter final of the senior hurling championship losing out by two points to Eoghan Ruadh who reached the final. The intermediate football team won the Stephens cup in 1984 and a number of our juveniles teams won leagues. In early 1980 a major fundraiser was started to get money to build a new club house. Fred Turner (Sn) with a number of club members organized this massive fundraising effort which was supported well by the people of Cabra. Another source of fundraising was program selling outside Croke Park. This was started in the late fifties when Seamus Nolan got the club into Croke Park to sell the programs on big match days. With Joe Casserly (JN) and Gerry Kehoe (sn) setting the foundation it still remains a great fundraiser for the club and the children who sell it. In this period Frank O Neill RIP, Dinny Vavosure RIP, Paddy Kelly ‚ÄòThe Saint‚Äô put in a lot of work in at committee and team management. In 1993 the senior hurlers won the senior hurling league and the junior football team won the Mooney Cup under the management of Paul Farrell. The Senior Hurling selectors were Joe Moran, Joe Lyons and Tommy McDonagh. In 1992 the club submitted plans for a new club house at the site at Charleville house but the council refused it. At that time two officials, Grace McGuire and Tom Mitchell, of the corporation were very sympathetic to the club's position on a new club house. They offered the club the playground site on Faussagh Avenue which had been lying idle for a number of years. The club had a general meeting and the members agreed to the move. The club drew up plans for the site with three of our members putting their houses up for collateral to allow the club to borrow 200,000 Irish pounds. With further money raised from big draws the club ran, work began on the new club house. The three members who put up their house are Joe Casserly (jn), Eilish Langan and Timmy Mullane. The club and the area will always be grateful for their faith and action. The new clubhouse was open in 1995 and is the heart of the community in Cabra. Five years later the club built a new gym complex with weights room, sauna, squash court, gym hall and changing rooms. Within a year the club installed an all-weather pitch when the City Council gave the club the remainder of the old playground. On the playing pitch over the last 15 years the club has gone from strength to strength. In football the club regained senior status by winning the Intermediate Championship in 2000. Within five years they had reached two championship finals and were joint winners of the league twice losing out in two plays offs. The selectors were Nicky Kehoe, Sean Kehoe and John Smithers (Sn). In 2000 The Minor hurlers won our first ever Minor championship when they captured the minor B Hurling championship by beating Na Fianna on a scoreline of 0-9 to 0-8. The minor team also won the Division 3 hurling title and Division 5 football title aswell as the cup. The manager was Robbie McCarthy(sn) with selectors Jim O‚ÄôDonnell, James Whelan and Club coach Paul McManus. In 2001 the junior football team won the league under the selectors of Paul Farrell, Gerry Kehoe (jn) and Harry Byrne. In 2007 the Intermediate team won the league under the management of Peter Fitzgerald, Mick Ward, Ray O‚ÄôReilly and Ciaran Stone. In 2001 the under 14 won the division 2 F√©ile and won division 7 in 2003. The mentors were Ronnie O Brian, Joe Glynn, Linda Lyons, Paul McManus and Paddy Whelan (Sn). Noel Paget, Dermot Smithers, Tony Smithers and Sean Kehoe were the managers of the division 7 team. In 1998 the under 12 Comogie team won the A Championship and in 2002 the club won the A Championship again at under 12 level. The mentors were Madeline Paget, Vincent Kehoe, Karl Homes and John Brown. In the adult section of Comogie, the team won the Junior B Championship in 1998 under the selectors of Joyce Carroll and Dessie Pool, and won the Junior A championship in 2001 under selectors Beatrice Casserly and Lee McKeogh they followed this up by winning the intermediate league and championship double in 2005 to go Senior under the management of Derek Sweetman, Catherine Kirby and Timmy Mullane. In 2008 the Senior Hurling team got promoted to Senior League Division 1. In 2009 they won the intermediate championship and reached the Leinster GAA Hurling Club Championship final. They were managed by Joe Brady, Joe Moran, Willy Mc auly, Martin Costelo, Nicky Kehoe and John Byrne. In 2010 The intermediate football team won the league. Under the management team of Joe Lyons, Liam Keating, Derek Sweetman and Ray O‚ÄôReilly. In 2011 The club won its first ever Senior Hurling B championship by beating St Patrick‚Äôs of Palmerstown by a point the final scoreline was 1-19 to 3-12 under the tutelage of Clare Native Dave Fogarty his backroom team was Joe Brady, Joe Moran, Nial Brady and Paddy Travers (sn) In 2012 The club captured The under 21 B hurling championship after Beating St Brigids under the management team of Nial Brady and Seamus McGrattan In 2013 The club won its first ever Minor Football B championship By beating Trinty Gaels under the management team of Joe Lyons, Ian McDonnell, Anthony Costello (jn) Derek Sweetman (jn) and Gerard O‚ÄôReilly. In 2014 The senior hurlers won promotion back to the Division 1 ranks after a play off win against Crumlin after extra time in Bray Emmets In 2016 The Club won its first ever senior hurling league and championship double when it captured the Senior 2 league title and second Senior B Hurlong championship within the space of a month. They beat Naomh Barrog in the championship final on a scoreline of 1-16 to 2-10. The manager was Nial Brady with selectors Lee McKeogh, Shane Langan, Seamus McGrattan, Sue Keogh, Joe Brady, Joe Moran. The team was coached by Tipperary native Richie Horgan. In 2018 The Intermediate Camogie team won the Intermediate 2 Camogie Championship after a 2-7 to 1-9 win over Naomh Olaf. The Manager was Thomas Gleeson with Timmie Mullane and Johnny Browne as selectors and Donal Ryan as coach. In 2020 was a unique year with the COVID 19 pandemic cancelling all league games. The county board decided that only championships would go ahead this season. And what a season it was for ‚ÄúThe Barr‚Äôs‚Äù with the Senior hurlers capturing there third Senior B championship in 10 years by beating Cuala B on a scoreline of 2-14 to 0-17. Followed 6 days later by the Intermediate footballers who won our first championship at that level since 2000 when they beat Naomh Barrog on a scoeline of 3-10 to 2-11. The senior hurlers were managed by Nial Brady with a backroom team consisting of Brendan Quinn, Shane Langan, Sue Keogh and Declan Fagan With Thomas Gleeson as coach. The intermediate footballers were managed by Keith Russell with a backroom team of Ian McDonnell, Gerard O‚ÄôReilly, Johnny Morgan(jn), Paddy Quinn and Cian Hall Quinn with Chris Moore as coach. In 1996 a small Irish language cr√®che was started by Elish Langan and Ellen Farrell. The seed planted, to promote our native tongue, has resulted in 250 pupils attending this school in 2010. A great achievement for all involved. Roll of Honour Miller Shield 1954. Under 15 Hurling League Winners D2 1958. Under 15 Hurling League Winner D1 1959. Under 16 Hurling League Winner D2 1959.

C. Williams, was an American philosopher and a professor at both the University of California Los Angeles (from 1930 to 1938) and at Harvard University (from 1939 to 1967). Life Williams was born in Crows Landing, California in 1899. As a teenager he was greatly interested in classics, English literature, poetry, and science fiction. He was a lifelong fan of the works of William Shakespeare, Mark Twain, and H.G. Wells. He studied English at Occidental College, California, and then English and Philosophy at Harvard University where he received an AM in Philosophy in 1925. He continued to study Philosophy and Psychology at UC-Berkeley. One of his teachers there was Jacob Loewenberg, and one of his peers was Arthur E. Murphy. In 1927 he returned to Harvard and obtained his PhD under the supervision of Ralph Barton Perry. He submitted his thesis - titled A Metaphysical Interpretation of Behaviorism - on 1 April 1928. In that same year he married Katherine Pressly Adams, who he knew from his time at UC-Berkeley. They had two sons: Donald Jr. and David. Williams was awarded a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship and studied philosophy in France and Germany, 1928-29. Upon his return to the United States he was an Instructor at Harvard in 1929 and then an Instructor at UCLA in 1930. He stayed for several years at UCLA, becoming Assistant Professor and Associate Professor. In 1938 he was awarded a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for the project Studies in Empirical Realism. This was the culmination of a research programme he had embarked on as part of the flourishing of realism started by Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, Samuel Alexander, the New Realists, and Critical Realists. In 1939 he was a Visiting Lecturer at Harvard; then Associate Professor and eventually Professor. He spent the rest of his career at Harvard, arguing for realism, constructing a trope ontology, and advocating a four-dimensionalist theory of time, among many other things such as defending the legitimacy of inductive inference. As a teacher he lectured for several decades mostly on metaphysics and the history of philosophy, influencing many students who went on to have successful careers and make an impact on analytic philosophy such as Roderick Chisholm, Nicholas Wolterstorff, and David Lewis. He retired from Harvard in 1967 to Fallbrook, California where he continued to write philosophy, maintain his correspondence, read papers at universities in California and elsewhere, and host philosophical friends. He died in 1983. Work Williams wrote on a wide range of philosophical topics, namely, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, logic, philosophy of science, probability theory, induction, philosophy of history, ethics, and history of philosophy. In what follows, only his more significant and influential contributions are surveyed. =Empiricism and realism= Williams thinks the goal of empiricism is to describe and explain the ‚Äòforeground of experience‚Äô and to ‚Äòintelligibly and credibly construct our account of the rest of the world‚Äô. The traditional understanding of empiricism, going back to John Locke, accepts the foreground of experience as the ground from which we construct our concepts and confirm certain conclusions that inform us of the rest of the world, especially other parts that are not experienced. According to Williams, empiricism says that a posteriori knowledge is known inductively. He further thought that induction is not restricted to experience and its content or restricted to science. Induction has ‚Äòontological reach‚Äô to things in themselves.Williams, Donald C. 'William James and the Facts of Knowledge' In In Commemoration of William James 1842-1942, Columbia University Press, 1942, p. 99 This means that empiricism and realism are compatible. He thus endorsed ‚Äòempirical realism‚Äô. He describes empirical realism as follows: > Our ‚Äúempirical realism‚Äù is realistic in the most venerable sense, that it > affirms there is valid knowledge of the nature and existence of a world > distinct from our perceptions and independent of them, and a fortiori > distinct from and independent of our thought and speech about it, and yet > empiricistic in the classical sense that it affirms that all knowledge, > including this, consists of conceptual constructions collected from and > confirmed by sensory experience. =Induction and probability= He also published a book on the problem of induction, The Ground of Induction (1947), which argued that the reliability of statistical sampling solves Hume's skepticism about induction. =Metaphysics: ontology= For Williams, ontology is the study of the categories of being. The subject matter of ontology is traditionally examined using an analytic mode of inquiry. An analysis of some X is in terms of X‚Äôs parts, whatever X might be. Analysis gets us the nature of X. Analysis in this sense is the classic decompositional sense, giving explanatory priority to parts over wholes. Analytic ontology is one branch of metaphysics.Williams, Donald C. 'The Elements of Being' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 74 A main issue in analytic ontology is the distinction between object and property. An object can have many properties. A property can be had by many objects. This chair has the property of being red, being made of wood, being hard, etc. This chair and every other chair in this room (say) all have the one property: being red. The first case has to do with predication. The second has to do with resemblance, and in particular, with resemblance among ordinary objects in intrinsic respects. In 'The Elements of Being', Williams points out that the fact that two red chairs resemble each other with respect to colour is explained in terms of the fact that each chair has a certain kind of part or aspect that exactly resembles each other. The ‚Äòred-part‚Äô of this chair and the ‚Äòred-part‚Äô of that chair exactly resemble each other and this grounds the fact that each chair resembles with other with respect to colour. These ‚Äòparts‚Äô are ‚Äòfine‚Äô, ‚Äòthin‚Äô, or abstract in a certain sense, the sense that is associated with the idea that an abstract entity is a certain kind of part of a whole.Williams, Donald C. 'The Elements of Being' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 85 These parts are also particulars. And they are particular as each chair. Hence they are abstract particulars, which Williams dubbed 'tropes'.Williams, Donald C. 'The Elements of Being' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 78 Such an analysis explains resemblance among ordinary objects in intrinsic respects. The red-part of this chair plays the role of being a property, a property had by the chair. It does this because in order for the property being red to be ‚Äòof‚Äô the chair it must be an abstract part of the chair and it must ‚Äòmanifest‚Äô Redness, i.e., manifest its kind. This chair, in fact, is nothing more than its abstract parts or tropes. This chair is a certain mereological sum of tropes, namely, the sum that ‚Äòconcurs‚Äô in a single region of spacetime. Such an analysis explains how an object can have many properties ‚Äì it does so in virtue of it having several tropes as abstract parts. One benefit of Williams's trope theory is that objective resemblance among ordinary objects in intrinsic respects is explained without positing universals as members of a primitive category of being. Another benefit is that his theory explains facts about predication without positing substances as members of a primitive category of being. Williams posits tropes as members of a fundamental category of being and then derives the category of universality and substance from tropes. Abstract particulars ground concrete particulars and abstract universals. This makes his theory a one-category ontology. Tropes comprise the one fundamental category of being. Keith Campbell carries this argument forward in Abstract Particulars (1990). There are several objections in the literature against Williams‚Äôs trope theory. And there are just as many philosophers who defend and develop the view. Contentious issues include the individuation of tropes, the nature of the concurrence relation that unifies tropes into concrete objects, the nature of the resemblance relation, the nature of universals, Williams‚Äôs account of predication, the simplicity of tropes (whether a basic trope is really a simple entity). And much more. These issues are part of on-going disputes in metaphysics. The main argument for trope theory is that it is the most ontically parsimonious hypothesis with the greatest explanatory power. As Williams remarks, he found trope theory 'so serviceable that it may well be true'.Williams, Donald C. 'The Elements of Being' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 74 It posits one category of being but at the same time explains the distinction between object and property, explains objective resemblance among ordinary objects in intrinsic respects, and explains facts about predication (of concrete particulars). Trope can also play the role of events and truthmakers and serve as the contents of mental acts such as perception and play the role of mental acts and states themselves. His trope theory remains a strong candidate for being the best explanation we have in analytic ontology. See also the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Williams. =Metaphysics: cosmology= Cosmology is the study of the contents of the world and how its contents are related to each other in the loosest sense. Typically, cosmology is studied from a speculative perspective, that is, a constructive perspective that involves inductively inferring the probable truth of a certain world hypothesis based on various pieces of evidence. For Williams, time and space fall under the study of cosmology. Speculative cosmology is the other branch of metaphysics, along with analytic ontology.Williams, Donald C. 'The Elements of Being' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 74 As D.M. Armstrong notes, this distinction between analytic ontology and speculative cosmology is a division within metaphysics.Armstrong, D.M. 'Reply to Forrest' In Ontology, Causality, and Mind: Essays in Honour of D.M. Armstrong, (eds.) J. Bacon, K. Campbell, L. Reinhardt, Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 66 As such, ontology does not exhaust metaphysics. Because Williams is an empiricist he thinks science can inform metaphysics, especially cosmology, as characterised above. He also thinks logic as well as common sense tell us something about time and our concept of time. He notes that science and logic and the canonical logic of science do not have any temporal reference. When a scientist proposes a law of nature or a scientific generalisation the scientist proposes a statement that holds regardless of temporal reference to a certain time or to the fact that a certain time is now. Similarly, in logic, arguments are presented without temporal reference. They are intended to be timeless.Williams, Donald C. 'The Sea Fight Tomorrow' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, pp. 265-66 In common sense talk we readily say that we have a future and have a past. He writes: ‚ÄòWe also say ‚ÄúIsaiah is one of the great spiritual heroes‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere is a meeting of the Dorcas Society tomorrow‚Äù, although Isaiah is dead and the society has not met yet‚Äô.Williams, Donald C. 'The Sea Fight Tomorrow' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 267 For Williams, the present is not ontically privileged. The past, present, and future are equally real. Things in the past are just as real as things in the present and the future. Time is just another mode of extent like the dimensions of space. And things are spread out in time just as much as they are spread out in space. So he thinks, objects persist through time by having temporal parts at different times.Williams, Donald C. 'The Myth of Passage' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 306 In this respect, he is a perdurantist. Lastly, Williams thinks events are temporally related by earlier than/later than relations in a four-dimensional manifold. Following Russell and McTaggart, Williams endorses a B-theory of time. Reality is fundamentally tenseless and tensed concepts and terms like ‚Äònow‚Äô and ‚Äòpresent‚Äô are merely indexical.Williams, Donald C. 'The Sea Fight Tomorrow' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 268 His preferred label for this theory of time is the ‚Äòpure manifold theory of time‚Äô.Williams, Donald C. 'The Nature of Time' In The Elements and Patterns of Being: Essays in Metaphysics, (ed.) A. R. J. Fisher, Oxford University Press, 2018, p. 179 The pure manifold theory of time is subject to many objections. In ‚ÄòThe Sea Fight Tomorrow‚Äô, Williams counters the objection that the future is open in an important sense and that because of the openness of the future the pure manifold theory of time is wrong. He argues that although things in the future are determinate or definite in one sense this does not imply that things in the future are determined.Williams, Donald C. 'The Sea Fight Tomorrow' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 274 It is not the case that contingent statements about the future are somehow indeterminate or without truth-values. In ‚ÄòThe Myth of Passage‚Äô, Williams confronts the objection that time passes in an important sense and because of the passage of time the pure manifold theory of time leaves something out about the nature of time and so is wrong. He argues that any appeal to temporal experience or a direct phenomenological intuition of time‚Äôs passage is bogus.Williams, Donald C. 'The Myth of Passage' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 293 Any sense we have of time‚Äôs passage can be explained in terms of the B-theoretic distribution of content in the four-dimensional manifold. On his view, there is no absolute or pure temporal becoming. In other work, recently published, he explains how the pure manifold theory of time can account for the metaphysical possibility of time travel. He further explains in what sense we can accept that there is a passage of time and how we can explain the arrow of time. The crux of his hypothesis is that facts about the B-theoretical distribution of content at the fundamental level of the four- dimensional manifold can do the necessary work in our explanation of the passage and arrow of time. His pure manifold theory of time is the first defence and detailed explication of a four-dimensional metaphysics of time in analytic metaphysics. The view continues to be defended in the literature and is a leading contender in the metaphysics of time. Influence Donald C. Williams, 11 March 1960 Williams was at the height of his career in the 1940s and 1950s. During this period the type of metaphysics he pursued was unpopular and ridiculed by logical positivism, ordinary language philosophy, and the later Wittgenstein. He was among a select few whose work in metaphysics persisted and made an impact on later philosophers. In addition, he fought back on various occasions ‚Äì first against logical positivism and its verificationist theory of meaning and conventionalism about the a priori, and second against Wittgensteinian critiques of metaphysics.Williams, Donald C. 'Philosophy and Psychoanalysis' In Psychoanalysis, Scientific Method, and Philosophy, ed. S. Hook, New York University Press, 1959 In other places he just scoffed at the ordinary language suggestion that problems about the world can be dissolved by studying the meaning and use of words. He once wrote: ‚ÄòIt is hard enough to keep one‚Äôs face straight at any of those readings of philosophical fortunes from the tea leaves of language which our British cousins call ‚Äúlogic‚Äù nowadays, but when one knows that the very leaves have been rigged, it is time to lodge a protest, good manners be hanged‚Äô.Williams, Donald C. 'Mind as a Matter of Fact' In Principles of Empirical Realism: Philosophical Essays, Charles C. Thomas, 1966, p. 249 For a number of reasons the fortunes of metaphysics turned around in the second half of the twentieth century. One reason is due to the influence of Williams‚Äôs work and instruction. In the late 1960s and 1970s his work was studied closely at the University of Sydney by such philosophers as D. M. Armstrong, John Bacon, Keith Campbell, and David Stove. These philosophers took what Williams had to say seriously. Armstrong writes: ‚ÄòIt so happens that Sydney University was for some years the world centre of Donald Williams studies‚Äô.Armstrong, D.M. 'Reply to Forrest' In Ontology, Causality, and Mind: Essays in Honour of D.M. Armstrong, (eds.) J. Bacon, K. Campbell, L. Reinhardt, Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 72, n. 1 Armstrong appreciated and implemented Williams‚Äôs conception of metaphysics and his distinction between analytic ontology and speculative cosmology in his theory of universals. Bacon and Campbell embraced Williams‚Äôs trope theory, expanding on the ontology and ensuring it remained a strong contender in the literature. Armstrong himself in later work came to realize the explanatory power of trope theory, which was a further boost to trope theory. Stove developed Williams‚Äôs theory of induction and it has been defended by others. His instruction at Harvard spans several decades and he came into contact with many students who went on to have respectable careers in philosophy, e.g., Roderick Chisholm and Donald Davidson. He supervised Nicholas Wolterstorff whose theory of universals as kinds bears a strong resemblance to Williams‚Äôs ontology. But the student he influenced the most was David Lewis. As a student in the 1960s Lewis audited and enrolled in Williams‚Äôs courses on ontology and cosmology, absorbing his Humean approach to metaphysics and his belief that metaphysics is legitimate. Lewis owes in part his Humean supervenience, four-dimensionalism, and metaphysics of time more generally to Williams. Lewis also developed certain arguments from Williams that proved pivotal in his own philosophical development. Just as Williams exploited analogies between time and space, Lewis exploited analogies between time and modality. Just as Williams argued that a realm of subsistent entities would lead to scepticism about one's existence, Lewis argued that a realm of possibles would lead to scepticism about one's actuality. For Lewis, the way out of the sceptical worry was to take actuality as a relative matter and interpret the word 'actual' as an indexical. The indexical account of actuality was - in Lewis's mind - one step down the road to modal realism: possible worlds are just as real as our world. Later on his career Lewis gravitated more and more towards Williams‚Äôs ontology, expressing sympathy with a sparse theory of tropes. Armstrong and Lewis were both influential figures who played their own part in bringing metaphysics back into mainstream philosophy. Given the influence of Williams on both Armstrong and Lewis, Williams played a key role in the revival of metaphysics. Williams‚Äôs articles on trope theory and four-dimensionalism are classic articles in analytic philosophy ‚Äì anthologised in many places and recently collected together with previously unpublished essays that advance his metaphysical theory in The Elements and Patterns of Being: Essays in Metaphysics (2018).

He currently has only two losses in the professional rankings. Early life As with many other boxers from the Philippines, Servania came from a poor family before arising into fame. His father was convicted in a crime earlier, and couldn't get a job. In return, his mother went out to sell fishes to provide the needs of their family. Eventually, Servania dropped out of school at the age of 15, and became a tricycle driver. To earn more for living, Servania started joining local tournaments as an amateur boxer, and won few fights before turning pro. He was then introduced to Antonio L. Aldeguer of ALA Promotions. Professional career Servania made his professional debut on February 21, 2009, at the age of 17, defeating Mike Espanosa via KO at the second round at PAGCOR Hotel and Casino, Goldenfield Commercial Complex, Bacolod City, Philippines. On June 2, 2012, the then 20-year Servania, won the vacant WBC International Silver Super Bantamweight title via TKO, knocking-down a more experienced Mexican boxer Genaro 'Pablonito' Garc√≠a at the 12th round. On his next fight held on August 18, 2012, Servania captured another belt, the vacant WBO Asia Pacific Super Bantamweight title against Jorge Pazos of Mexico via unanimous decision. On October 26, 2013, during the Pinoy Pride XXII, Servania won the vacant WBO Inter-Continental Super Bantamweight title after knocking- out Panama's Rafael Concepci√≥n at the 2nd round. During the Pinoy Pride XXVII held at Dubai World Trade Centre, Dubai, United Arab Emirates on September 5, 2014, Servania stopped the Mexican Jose 'Matador' Cabrera at the 10th round, and retained his WBO Intercontinental Super Bantamweight title. On April 29, 2017, Genesis Servania stops Ralph Jhon Lulu in two rounds to claim the vacant WBO Asia Pacific Featherweight title in Japan.http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/168372-genesis- servania-ernie-sanchez-kos-japan Professional boxing record  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"32 Wins (15 knockouts, 16 decisions), 2 Defeat (0 Knockout), 0 Draw, 0 No Contests - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\\"  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Res.  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Record  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Opponent  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Type  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Rd., Time  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Date  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Location  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Notes - align=center Loss 33-2 align=left Carlos Castro    align=left align=left - align=center Win 32‚Äì1 align=left Carlos Carlson    align=left align=left - align=center Win 31‚Äì1 align=left Jason Butar Butar    align=left align=left - align=center Win 30‚Äì1 align=left Kittiwat Sirichotchayakun    align=left align=left - align=center Loss 29‚Äì1 align=left √ìscar Valdez {{smallUD   align=left align=left For WBO featherweight title - align=center Win 29‚Äì0 align=left Ralph Jhon Lulu    align=left align=left - align=center Win 28‚Äì0 align=left Alexander Espinoza    align=left align=left - align=center Win 27‚Äì0 align=left Hendrik Barongsay    align=left align=left - align=center Win 26‚Äì0 align=left Juan Luis Hernandez    align=left align=left - align=center Win 25‚Äì0 align=left Jos√© Cabrera    align=left align=left - align=center Win 24‚Äì0 align=left Alexander Mu√±oz    align=left align=left - align=center Win 23‚Äì0 align=left Rafael Concepci√≥n    align=left align=left - align=center Win 22‚Äì0 align=left Konosuke Tomiyama    align=left align=left - align=center Win 21‚Äì0 align=left Isack Junior    align=left align=left - align=center Win 20‚Äì0 align=left Angky Angkotta    align=left align=left - align=center Win 19‚Äì0 align=left Jorge Pazos    align=left align=left. - align=center Win 18‚Äì0 align=left Genaro Garc√≠a    align=left align=left - align=center Win 17‚Äì0 align=left Nick Otieno    align=left align=left - align=center Win 16‚Äì0 align=left Marcos Cardenas    align=left align=left - align=center Win 15‚Äì0 align=left Gerson Guerrero    align=left align=left - align=center Win 14‚Äì0 align=left Richard Donaire    align=left align=left - align=center Win 13‚Äì0 align=left Prell Tupaz    align=left align=left - align=center Win 12‚Äì0 align=left Renan Branzuela    align=left align=left - align=center Win 11‚Äì0 align=left Alvin Makiling    align=left align=left - align=center Win 10‚Äì0 align=left Donriel Marcos    align=left align=left - align=center Win 9‚Äì0 align=left Jestoni Pepito    align=left align=left - align=center Win 8‚Äì0 align=left Jog Alim    align=left align=left - align=center Win 7‚Äì0 align=left Jun Piacidad    align=left align=left - align=center Win 6‚Äì0 align=left Melchor Abcede    align=left align=left - align=center Win 5‚Äì0 align=left Jomar Cabusas    align=left align=left - align=center Win 4‚Äì0 align=left Joseph Altieza    align=left align=left - align=center Win 3‚Äì0 align=left Mar Nonescan    align=left align=left - align=center Win 2‚Äì0 align=left Powell Balaba    align=left align=left - align=center Win 1‚Äì0 align=left Mike Espanosa    align=left align=left Regional and Minor Titles *WBO Asia Pacific Featherweight Title (April 2017) *WBO Inter-Continental Super Bantamweight Title (October 2013) *WBO Asia Pacific Super Bantamweight Title (August 2012) *WBC International Silver Super Bantamweight Title (June 2012) See also *List of Filipino boxing world champions *List of WBO world champions *List of super-bantamweight boxing champions *2014 in Philippine sports *2015 in Philippine sports *List of Philippine television specials aired in 2014 References External links  * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Bantamweight boxers Category:Sportspeople from Bacolod Category:Filipino male boxers Category:Boxers from Negros Occidental ","title":"Genesis Servania"},{"id":"45635396","text":"The National Democratic Front (, FND) is a political party in the Central African Republic.

He was the uncle of Olof Palme, the prime minister of Sweden, who was murdered in 1986.  Life  Palme was born in Porvoo, Finland as the son of the Swedish politician and artillery officer Sven Palme and Finnish Hanna von Born. He went to school in Stockholm and later studied history at the University of Uppsala. Palme took part of the archaeological excavations in the Medieval Sigtuna and was the founder of the 1916 established Sigtuna museum. Palme was known as a keen anti-socialist who was radicalized after the 1906 Hakaniemi riot in Helsinki. He was openly racist and has been described as a proto-fascist.

Shaw House is a historic house at 40 Norris Street in Greenville, Maine, which now houses the Greenville Inn. Built in 1895, it is a handsome and elaborate example of Queen Anne architecture in a rural small- town setting. The house was designed by Edwin E. Lewis of Gardiner, with alterations by Wilfred E. Mansur of Bangor. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013 for its architecture, and for its association with William Shaw, a leading lumber businessman active in Greenville in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whose business interests also included ownership of the steamer Katahdin. Description and history The Shaw House is set on a hill a short way south of Greenville's central business district, which is at the southern tip of Moosehead Lake. The property includes, in addition to the main house, a period carriage house and six guest cottages built when the property was converted to an inn. The house is a large, basically rectangular, block, facing Norris Street to the south and connected to the carriage house to the east. It has a hip roof that is studded on the south with two projecting gable sections and on each on the west and north side. A hip-roof dormer projects from the roof between the gable sections on the south. The projecting gable sections top polygonal bays, and have closed pediments with paired sash windows at the center, surrounded by a field of decorative cut wood shingles. There is a single-story porch on the west end, supported by round columns, with a balustraded second level. A single-story open porch also runs along most of the south facade, up to a porte-cochere-style main entrance near the back of the original main block, where it meets the ell connecting the house to the carriage house.Mitchell, Christi (2013). NRHP nomination for William M. Shaw House; available by request from the Maine SHPO William M. Shaw (1861-1936) was a leading lumber businessman in Greenville. He operated a saw mill, lumber yard, and retail store in the center of town, and his M. G. Shaw Company owner large tracts of timberland. The Shaw Company also operated the steamer Katahdin, which not only hauled lumber across the lake, but also ferried passengers to the Mount Kineo Resort area. Shaw hired Gardiner-based architect Edwin. E. Lewis to design his home, which was built starting in about 1890, and is one of the most opulent houses in Piscataquis County. The house underwent major expansion around 1905, designed by Bangor architect Wilfred E. Mansur, who Shaw had also hired to build his office building in the town as well as the commercial Shaw Block. Mansur's alterations included a substantial enlargement of the carriage house and construction of the ell joining the main house. The house was converted for use as an inn in the mid-20th century, at which time two of the property's cabins were built. The other cabins are all late-20th century additions.

The station is located in near the city centre of Alexandroupoli at the Alexandroupoli‚ÄìSvilengrad railway. Trains coming from Thessaloniki have to reverse for a few hundred meters to reach the station. History The station was opened in 1874, two years after the line from Alexandroupoli (then Dedeagac) to Istanbul via Edirne was completed. Built by the Chemins de fer Orientaux (CO), from Istanbul to Vienna. The railway reached Ftelia in 1873, when the line from Istanbul to Edirne and Bulgaria was opened. When the railway was built it was all within the Ottoman Empire. Until 1909 there was no connection between the lines Istanbul‚ÄìAlexandroupoli and Thessaloniki‚ÄìAlexandroupoli (opened in 1896) at Alexandroupoli; a connection existed between Feres and Potamos (near current Avas). During World War I the railway was an important link as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria and Austria- Hungary were all Central Allies. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about Moden measurement done on www.Openstreetmap.com indicate 10.2 km in Turkey serving Edirne Karaaga√ß station and for between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in BulgariaLe Journal des chemins de fer, des mines et des TP, Paris, 29 March 1930 (in French) come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929. Under the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaaƒüa√ß railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad. This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory, so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed though Ormenio. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. 29 April 1954 Alexandroupolis Railway Station was the setting for a formal visit by King Paul and then Prince Constantine.http://www.trainose.gr/œÑŒ∑ŒΩ-1Œ∑-Œ∑ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±-Œø-Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ-Œ≠œÜœÑŒπŒ±ŒæŒµ-œÑŒøŒΩ-œÉŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÅœåŒ¥œÅ/ In 1958 the station was rebuilthttp://www.trainose.gr/œÑŒ∑ŒΩ-1Œ∑-Œ∑ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±-Œø-Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ- Œ≠œÜœÑŒπŒ±ŒæŒµ-œÑŒøŒΩ-œÉŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÅœåŒ¥œÅ/ in a more modern style. The following year, the station saw the arrival of German the Patriarch of Serbia. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE Law 674/1971, Government Gazette A-192/1970 taking over responsibilities for most for Greece‚Äôs rail infrastructure.

In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. Services from Feres to Alexandroupoli were cut back to three trains a day, reducing the reliability of services, and passenger numbers. With passenger footfall in sharp decline. On 11 February 2011, all cross border routes were closed and international services (to Istanbul, Sofia, etc.) were ended.

National Security Agency, et al. is a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation and several other organizations against the National Security Agency (NSA), the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), and other named individuals, alleging mass surveillance of Wikipedia users carried out by the NSA. The suit claims the surveillance system, which NSA calls \\"Upstream\\", breaches the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects freedom of speech, and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland as the NSA is based in Fort Meade, Maryland.David Ingram, NSA sued by Wikimedia, rights groups over mass surveillance, Reuters (March 10, 2015). The suit was dismissed in October 2015 by Judge T. S. Ellis III; this decision was appealed four months later to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals by the Wikimedia Foundation. The Court of Appeals found that the dismissal was valid for all of the plaintiffs except the Foundation, whose allegations the court found \\"plausible\\" enough to have legal standing for the case to be remanded to the lower court. The original plaintiffs besides the Wikimedia Foundation were the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA, the PEN American Center, the Global Fund for Women, The Nation magazine, the Rutherford Institute, and the Washington Office on Latin America. Background NSA slide referring to Wikipedia as a surveillance target Upstream surveillance was first revealed in May 2013 by Edward Snowden, a former NSA analyst. A previous challenge by the ACLU, Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, failed for lack of standing. In the light of some of the leaks by Snowden, which included an above Top Secret NSA slide that specifically referred to Wikipedia as a target for HTTP surveillance, the Wikimedia Foundation pushed forward with a legal complaint against the NSA for violating its users' First and Fourth Amendment rights. Since Clapper, the government itself has confirmed many of the key facts about NSA's Upstream surveillance, including that it conducts suspicionless searches. ACLU attorney Patrick Toomey noted the lawsuit is particularly relevant as the plaintiffs engage in \\"hundreds of billions of international communications\\" annually. Any program of Upstream surveillance must necessarily sweep up a substantial part of these communications. Litigation On August 6, 2015, the defendants (National Security Agency, et al.) brought a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs have not plausibly shown that they have been injured by Upstream collection of data and thus lack standing to sue. In response, the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief on behalf of a group of libraries and booksellers. Both sides presented oral arguments at a hearing on September 25, 2015. On October 23, 2015, the District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed the suit on grounds of standing. US District Judge T. S. Ellis III ruled that the plaintiffs could not plausibly prove they were subject to Upstream surveillance, echoing the 2013 decision in Clapper v. Amnesty International US. The Wikimedia Foundation said it expected to appeal the decision. The Foundation said its complaint had merit, and that there was no question that Upstream surveillance captured the communications of both its user community and the Wikimedia Foundation itself. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, who had filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, said it was perverse to dismiss a suit for lack of proof (standing) when the surveillance program complained of was secret, and urged federal courts to tackle the serious constitutional issues that Upstream surveillance presents. The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on February 17, 2016. On May 23, 2017, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the dismissal by the lower court of Wikimedia's complaints. The Court of Appeals ruled that the Foundation's allegations of the NSA's Fourth Amendment violations were plausible enough to \\"survive a facial challenge to standing\\", finding that the potential harm done by the NSA's collection of private data was not speculative. The court thereby remanded the suit by the Foundation and ordered the District Court of Maryland to continue the proceedings. The court inversely affirmed the dismissal by Ellis of the suits by the other plaintiffs; in its finding the court noted that the non- Wikimedia plaintiffs had not made a strong enough case that their operations were affected by Upstream's scope. On December 16, 2019, the District Court held that the Wikimedia Foundation did not have standing to proceed with its claims. On February 14, 2020, the Wikimedia Foundation filed a notice of appeal in this case before the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See also * Jewel v.

More recently the attribution to Kuhnau has been doubted.Der Gerechte k√∂mmt um BWV deest; BC C 8 (= BC D 10/3) at : \\"...(vielleicht irrt√ºmlich?) Johann Kuhnau zugeschriebenen Motette Tristis est anima mea\\" (\\"[of the] motet Tristis est anima mea (maybe erroneously?) attributed to Johann Kuhnau\\") By then it proved impossible to ascertain authorship on source-critical grounds (among other reasons while the Leipzig parts mentioned by Spitta could no longer be traced). =Text= The motet is set to the Latin text of the second Tenebrae responsory for Maundy Thursday. The theme of that text is Jesus in the garden Gethsemane, addressing his disciples. Its first two lines are quoted from . The first words of the text, told in the first person, are translated as \\"My soul is exceeding sorrowful\\" in the King James Version (KJV). in The King James Bible While the first two lines are quoted from the Bible, the next two are anonymous poetry, Jesus predicting that the disciples will see a crowd (\\"\\"), they will take flight (\\"\\"), and he will go to be sacrificed for them (\\"\\").Tristis est anima mea at Choral Public Domain Library = Music = Drexel 4302 The composer set the motet for five parts, two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass (SSATB). He followed an example by Orlande de Lassus of the same text also for five parts, indicated depending on edition as SAATB or SATTB. Both works open in a similar way, with \\"closely overlapping vocal entries, and both shift to homophonic declamation at the words \\"Iam videbitis turbam\\" (You will see the crowd). The composer follows Italian models. John Butt describes his approach as \\"conservative in texture but extremely expressive\\". The first eight measures are devoted exclusively to the word \\"tristis\\" (sad, sorrowful), with the voices entering one after the other, each beginning with a long note, from the lowest to the highest which sings only a short sighing motif. Only then comes the complete first line, expressed in polyphony until measure 20, ending with \\"ad mortem\\" (unto death), which the bass sings in a chromatic downward line of long notes. \\"ad mortem\\" is repeated, mirroring the beginning: the voices enter again one after the other but beginning with the highest voice. The harmonies are intensified, resolved in measure 30. After a short rest, the second line of the text is presented in similar building, this time in the sequence from inside out: alto, soprano II and tenor together, soprano I and bass almost together, all arriving in measure 50 in homophony on the last word \\"mecum\\", which marks the end of the biblical text and is followed by a long rest with a fermata. The predictions follow each other without a rest. The first (you will see a crowd) one begins in homophonic declamation, the second (which will surround me, measure 60) building with entrances in the sequence tenor, alto, soprano II, bass, soprano I, the third (you will take flight, measure 70) in denser texture with two voices entering together and a repeated motif of a faster descending line. In the fourth prediction \\"Et ego vadam\\" (And I will go, measure 85), Jesus speaks of himself, and the composer expresses it by the voices entering one after another, but with exactly the same motif, in the first four voices even from the same pitch (tenor, bass, soprano II, alto. After a leap down of a minor sixth, even steps lead upwards. The voices arrive in homophony when they first pronounce \\"immolari\\" (sacrificed), followed by a second long rest with a fermata. The word is repeated and intensified (from measure 99), with a climax of the soprano ascending step by step to G, their highest note. The words \\"pro vobis\\" (for you) follow within the polyphony, first by the alto, followed immediately by soprano II, soprano I and bass together, tenor. In the last phrase, the ascending steps appear in the bass. Throughout the piece, the composer keeps the same tempo and mood, with subtle attention to different parts and even individual words of the text. It has been described as a \\"serenely reflective\\" work. Butt concludes:  '  Around 1750 the pasticcio passion oratorio Wer ist der, so von Edom k√∂mmt was assembled in the circle around Johann Sebastian Bach and his son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnickol. Its basis was the then popular passion cantata Ein L√§mmlein geht und tr√§gt die Schuld (A lambkin goes and bears our guilt) by Carl Heinrich Graun (GraunWV B:VII:4), which was expanded with compositions by Georg Philipp Telemann and others. Nos. 19 and 20 of the pasticcio appeared to be composed by Johann Sebastian Bach (BWV 127 No. 1 and 1088 respectively). On stylistic grounds scholars such as Diethard Hellmann see chorus No. 39 of the pasticcio, an orchestrated version of the Tristis est anima mea motet on a parody text, as an arrangement by Bach. The music is transposed half a tone down to E minor.Der Gerechte k√∂mmt um BWV deest; BC C 8 (= BC D 10/3) at The German text of the chorus, ' (The righteous perishes), is translated from . Ecce quomodo moritur justus, a Latin version of that text, is another responsory for Holy Week.Ecce quomodo moritur at Choral Public Domain Library The arrangement with the German text may have been a stand-alone (funeral?) motet performed in Leipzig in Bach's time. The orchestral accompaniment consists of two characteristic woodwind parts, strings and continuo.Der Gerechte k√∂mmt um BWV deest; BC C 8 (= BC D 10/3) at : \\"traverse flute I, traverse flute II, oboe I, oboe II, violin I, violin II, viola, basso continuo\\" If both attributions are correct (the original to Kuhnau, the arrangement to Bach) this seems the only instance of Bach adopting music of his predecessor. Kuhnau's ideas were however more easily adopted by his successor: there is the imitation of Kuhnau's style in the final chorus of Bach's very first cantata for Leipzig, there are the links to Kuhnau in Bach's Magnificat (SSATB chorus, Christmas interpolations) and there are the similarities in both their Clavier-√úbung publications. Harsh judgements have been passed on the quality of Kuhnau's music: Spitta, after describing various aspects of where he sees Kuhnau's choral music wanting, concludes: \\"Kuhnau did not understand the world, nor did the world understand him...\\"Spitta, o.c. pp. 335-336 The musical quality of Tristis est anima mea appears to rise above this, which is why the attribution to Kuhnau is considered doubtful, and why it seems reasonable to assume that Bach, judging on quality, reused it. Bach was known for \\"signing\\" many of his works with the notes B-A-C-H in key places (\\"B\\" is used in German for B flat, while \\"H\\" is used for B natural). In bars 36‚Äì38 the alto, as the only syncopated voice, sings B-A-C-H in a harmonically complicated cadence ending the first main phrase, followed by the text und niemand achtet darauf (\\"and nobody notices it\\"). The same passage in Tristis est anima mea (ad mortem, bars 28‚Äì30) is much simpler harmonically, both together offering a further indication of an arrangement of the piece by Bach.  Publication  ' was published by the Carus-Verlag in a version with basso continuo. The motet appears in a critical edition named The Kuhnau-Project, edited by David Erler in the Pfefferkorn Musikverlag.  Recordings  ' was frequently recorded, including by the Dresdner Kreuzchor conducted by Rudolf Mauersberger in 1957, and by the Windsbacher Knabenchor conducted by Hans Thamm in 1967. A collection of Kuhnau's sacred music was performed by The King‚Äôs Consort, conducted by Robert King, in 1998. The Kammerchor Joaquin des Pr√©z, conducted by Ludwig B√∂hme, sang it in 2012 as part of a collection of music by Bach and his predecessors as Thomaskantor. A reviewer notes: \\"The setting Tristis est anima mea is not wholly authenticated as being by Johann Kuhnau ... Yet whoever wrote it, this Motet, so sure, direct and moving, is one of the most ear-catching in this selection.\\"  References  External links   List of recordings of Tristis Est Anima Mea (Kuhnau) at AllMusic * Johann Kuhnau: Motet Tristis est anima mea ‚Äì Motet Der Gerechte k√∂mmt um history, scoring, sources for text and music, translations to various languages, discography, discussion at * Der Gerechte kommt um (score, part- scores, MIDI) at kantorei-noten.de Category:Motets Category:Music for the Holy Week Category:Compositions with a spurious or doubtful attribution ","title":"Tristis est anima mea (attributed to Kuhnau)"},{"id":"45635757","text":"Metapone johni, is a species of ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae, which can be found from Sri Lanka.

Located between Maine State Route 3 and overlooking Compass Harbor, this 1904 Shingle style house was built for David R. Ogden, a New York City lawyer, to designs by the Boston firm Andrews, Jaques and Rantoul. The house was characterized in 1906 as \\"an excellent example of shingle work\\"; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  Description and history  Nannau is set on the south side of a private drive, south of the main village of Bar Harbor, and located between Maine State Route 3 and Compass Harbor, an inlet off Frenchman Bay. It has a two-story rectangular main block, oriented northwest to southeast, with projecting ells at both ends. It has a steeply- pitched hip roof, with projecting 2-1/2 story gable sections on the main land- side facade, flanking a smaller single-story entry portico with its own steeply-pitched hip roof with a flared edge. The walls are finished in wood shingles. Nannau was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Andrews, Jaques, and Rantoul, who were responsible for the design of a number of Bar Harbor's finest summer estates. It was built in 1904 for David R. Ogden, a New York lawyer who helped found Saint Saviour's Church in Bar Harbor, and who gained a national reputation for his philanthropic work with the American Red Cross during the First World War. The house was featured in a 1906 edition of The Country House, in which it was described as \\"an excellent example of shingle work\\". The house in recent years was used as a bed and breakfast that is now closed. Currently it is a private residence.

After winning both his races in France he was transferred to Ireland where he won two novice hurdles. In the 2013/14 National Hunt season he was undefeated in five races including the Red Mills Trial Hurdle in Ireland and both the Prix Hypothese and the Prix Leon Rambaud in France. When switched to steeplechases he recovered from a fall on his debut to win the Arkle Novice Chase, Arkle Challenge Trophy and Ryanair Novice Chase in the 2014‚Äì15 season. In 2015‚Äì16 he won the Clarence House Chase but was beaten by Sprinter Sacre when favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase in what was his first defeat when completing a steeplechase. He began the 2016‚Äì17 with a win in the Tingle Creek Chase and followed up with his second victory in the Clarence House Chase before taking the Ryanair Chase in March. In 2018 Un de Sceaux became the first horse in history to win three Clarence House chases but was disappointed in Cheltenham by Balko des Flos when attempting to regain his Ryanair crown. He finished the season on a high by winning the devenish chase at Fairyhouse before surprising his stablemate Douvan at Punchestown under Patrick Mullins. At this stage of his career Un de Sceaux has won 9 Grade ones and has earned over 1,300,000 in prize money. Background Un de Sceaux is a bay gelding with two white socks bred in France by the Haras de La Rousseliere (based in Soulaire-et-Bourg) & Mme M. Choveau. His sire, Denham Red, won over hurdles in France before becoming a successful sire of jumpers. Un de Sceaux's dan Hotesse de Sceaux was officially an AQPS mare as her damsire Diarifos was not a Thoroughbred. During the early part of his racing career, the horse was trained in France by his owner Fabrice Foucher. Racing careerEarly career= Un de Sceaux ran twice as a four-year-old in France in flat races for non-Thoroughbred horses, winning by twenty lengths at Machecoul in February and by seven lengths at Saint-Brieuc in October. He was then sold and sent to race in Ireland where he entered the ownership of Edward O'Connell and was trained by Willie Mullins. On his first appearance in Ireland he was ridden by Ruby Walsh and started 9/10 favourite for a Novice Hurdle race on 20 February at Punchestown Racecourse and led from the start to win by six lengths from Sammy Black and sixteen others. Two months later he started 5/4 favourite over the same course and distance and again made all the running to beat Moscow Mannon by thirteen lengths. =2013/14 National Hunt season: hurdles= Un de Sceaux was unbeaten in five races over hurdles in the 2013/14 National Hunt season. He began the season by winning by twenty-nine lengths at Thurles Racecourse in December and followed up at Navan Racecourse three weeks later coming home more than fifty lengths clear of his two opponents. In February he was moved up in class to contest the Grade 2 Red Mills Trial Hurdle on heavy ground at Gowran Park. Starting at odds of 1/14 he led from the start as usual won very easily by sixteen lengths from Midnight Game. Mullins opted to miss the 2014 Cheltenham Festival and instead sent the horse to race in France in spring. On 29 March he was matched against the Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil winner Gemix in the Prix Hypothese over 3900 metres at Auteuil Hippodrome from whom he was receiving eight pounds. Ridden by Barry Geraghty, he led from the start and went fifteen lengths clear of the field but had to be ridden out in the closing stages to hold the late challenge of Gemix by a short neck. Ruby Walsh was reunited with Un de Sceaux a month later, when the gelding faced Gemix again in the Prix Leon Rambaud over the same course and distance. He took the lead at the first hurdle and was never headed, winning by two lengths from Le Grand Luce with Gemix in fourth. Walsh was later to say that the horse's races in France \\"made a man of him\\". =2014/15 National Hunt season: novice chases= In the 2014/15 season, Un de Sceaux was campaigned in novice steeplechases. On his debut over the larger obstacles, he started 1/8 favourite at Thurles in November, but after building up a considerable lead, he fell at the third last fence. Walsh described it as \\"a novicey fall\\" and insisted \\"he's a hell of a good horse\\". A month later at Fairyhouse he recorded his first chasing success when he won by twelve lengths from Smashing, with a gap of thirty lengths back to the other eleven finishers. After the race, Marcus Armytage, writing in the Daily Telegraph described Un de Sceaux as \\"the most exciting chaser seen in Ireland in ages\\" and compared his racing style to that of Desert Orchid. In January he was moved up to Grade 1 class for the Arkle Novice Chase at Leopardstown Racecourse. He started favourite against two opponents: the Racing Post Novice Chase winner Clarcam and the Shannon Airport Novice Chase winner Gilgamboa. He took the lead from the start as usual and drew away in the straight to win by fifteen lengths. Comparing the winner to previous champion two-milers he had ridden, Walsh said \\"He doesn't stop and he doesn't quit and he'll find plenty for a smack if needed. I loved the way he goes at fences and never backs off. He's more like Azertyuiop than Master Minded. Azertyuiop took a bit of riding and this fella's the same\\". On 10 March 2015, Un de Sceaux started 4/6 favourite for the Arkle Challenge Trophy on the opening day of the Cheltenham Festival. Clarcam was again in opposition but the betting suggested that his main danger would come from the Paul Nicholls-trained Vibrato Valtat, who had won the Henry VIII Novices' Chase, Wayward Lad Novices' Chase and the Kingmaker Novices' Chase in his last three races. Un de Sceaux took his customary early lead and shook off the challenge of Vibrato Valtat approaching the second last. He jumped the last two lengths clear of God's Own before drawing away in the closing stages to win by six lengths. After the race, Mullins said \\"He's not a typical racehorse and I don't think he's any pedigree, either, which is extraordinary. He is what we call a pure freak\\". The gelding ended his season in the Ryanair Novice Chase at Punchestown on 30 April and started the 1/10 favourite against four opponents. He led from the start and won by three lengths from the British challenger Just Cameron. =2015/16 National Hunt season: steeplechases= After an absence of almost eight months, Un de Sceaux returned in the Grade 1 Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase at Leopardstown on 27 December. Starting at odds of 1/4 against five opponents he went to the front from the start and was still clear of his rivals when he fell at the second last fence. On 23 January he was matched against the 2014 Queen Mother Champion Chase winner Sire de Grugy in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot Racecourse and was made the 1/2 favourite. After leading from the start he shook off a challenge from Sire de Grugy approaching the last fence and drew away on the flat to win by five lengths. Mullins commented \\"He just settled into his own rhythm and he jumped in his own time... Ruby sat there and let him sort himself out. It was much better today\\". On his second appearance at the Cheltenham Festival Un de Sceaux started 4/6 favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He took the lead four fences from the finish but was overtaken approaching the final turn and finished second, three and a half lengths behind Sprinter Sacre. He faced Sprinter Sacre again in the Celebration Chase at Sandown but made numerous jumping errors and was beaten fifteen lengths into second. Un de Sceaux was sent to France for a summer campaign beginning with the Prix La Barka at Auteuil on 21 May. Racing on very soft ground he was among the leaders from the start an drew away in the closing stages to win \\"very comfortably\\" by eight lengths from Le Grand Luce. Three weeks later the gelding was stepped up in distance for France's premier hurdle race, the Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil over 5100 metres. He started favourite and disputed the lead for most of the way but weakened from the second last obstacle and finished sixth behind the British-trained Ptit Zig. =2016/17 National Hunt season: steeplechases= Un de Sceaux began the 2016/17 National Hunt season in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown Park on 3 December and started 5/4 favourite ahead of Sire de Grugy, God's Own (Punchestown Champion Chase) and Ar Mad (Henry VIII Novices' Chase). After racing in second place behind Ar Mad he took the lead but jumped poorly at the last and was overtaken by Sire de Grugy. He rallied strongly on the run-in, regained the advantage and won by a length and a neck from Sire de Grugy and God's Own. In January he attempted to repeat his 2016 success in the Clarence House Chase and started 1/2 favourite ahead of six opponents. He took the lead at the tenth fence and stayed on well to win by five lengths from the Ryanair Chase winner Uxizandre with Dodging Bullets and Special Tiara in fourth and fifth. In the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham on 16 March Un de Sceaux started favourite against seven opponents. He put in an exuberant display of jumping under Ruby Walsh to win by 1 and a half lengths from Sub Lieutenant to complete three grade ones in a row for Willie Mullins Iron Horse. Un de Sceaux attempted to make it four grade ones in a row in the Boylesports Punchestown Champion Chase. However he met stiff opposition from the Colin Tizzard trained Fox Norton and suffered his first defeat of the campaign finishing second by almost 2 lengths. .

The film focuses on a family beset by tragedy when the father is presumed dead after his ship is lost at sea. The mother struggles to support her child and sells her possessions to a pawnbroker. When she has nothing left, save her wedding ring, the pawnbroker asks to take care of the child and the mother consents. The pawn broker gives her a pawn ticket for the girl stating \\"a precious jewel, a value beyond price\\" and tells her she can redeem it at any time. Before her death, she entrusts the ticket to a friend. Ten years pass, the shipwrecked father has discovered a great fortune on the island and is rescued by a passing steamship. The father soon realizes his wife is dead and his child is missing, but he receives the pawn ticket and decides to claim this jewel his wife had left for him. He redeems it at the pawn shop and finds it is his lost daughter. The film was released on November 29, 1910 and it was met with positive reviews. The film survives in the Library of Congress archives.  Plot  Though a modern synopsis has not been published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: \\"Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, with the exception of a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she can go out and get work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which he fills out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead. \\"And he is not. He has been cast up on a fertile island in the South Seas, where he lives a Crusoe-like existence for 10 years, and incidentally finds buried treasure which makes him rich. He was finally rescued by a passing steamer and brought back to his own country, only to find that in his absence his wife has died, no one knows the fate of his child. He only finds, in an envelope addressed to him in the hand of his dying wife, a pawn ticket for a 'precious jewel' which she has pledged. Thinking the jewel to be some gift of his to his wife, which she desired him to have as a remembrance, he goes to the pawnshop and is there waited upon by a sweet-faced girl of 15 to whom he is at once attracted. The girl is unable to find any article in the shop with a ticket corresponding to the number on the ticket which the captain carries, and appeals to her foster father, Levy, to help her find the gentleman's goods. Levy at once recognizes the ticket as the one he gave for his little adopted daughter. Although he dislikes to surrender the one joy of his life, he finally decides to reunite father and daughter. The latter have the old pawnbroker make his home with them, so the reunion brings happiness to all.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only known cast credit is for Marie Eline having been in the film as the young child who is pawned. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 29, 1910. One advertisement stated that an alternate title for the film was The Castaway Finds the Hidden Treasure, but this may be in error. The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Kansas, Texas, South Dakota, Vermont, and Missouri. The film was met with positive reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World highlighted that novelty of the subject, having the child being pawned only to be reclaimed by the father. Despite the novelty of the plot, the reviewer stated, \\"While the play attracts because of this novelty, it still has dramatic interest, dramatic because it tells a life story in a simple way. Such stories are the most interesting since there are numerous persons who see it that can duplicate it either in their own experience or the experience of some of their friends or acquaintances.\\" The reviewer for the Mirror was critical of the film, stating the plot was improbable, but it was well-acted. The only fault identified by the reviewer was the improper depiction of the poor, for the mother could not keep her child, but kept her maid. The reviewer also noted that the maid also did not age after the apparent ten year time-skip. In 2001, the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation acquired an original 35 mm nitrate film print from John Conning. The intention was to deposit the film in the Library of Congress. The surviving print is 925 feet in length, but it is not listed as being a whole or partial print.

Origins and the Royal Waggoners In 1793, Revolutionary French Forces invaded the Low Countries and declared war on Britain. Existing military plans relied on local men to provide supplies and transport for the British Army overseas, which proved to be inadequate. Therefore, the first uniformed Transport Corps, named the Royal Waggoners, was created on 7 March 1794. One year later, after British forces withdrew from the Low Countries, the Royal Waggoners were disbanded. Royal Waggon Train (1802‚Äì1832) In 1799, Sir Ralph Abercromby led a British expedition into North Holland to break the French hold on the strategically important Scheldt estuary. Another Transport Corps, overseen by Waggon Master General Digby Hamilton, Lieutenant Colonel (later Colonel), was created to support this effort. Initially titled the Royal Waggon Corps, it was renamed the Royal Waggon Train, ranking as a \\"Mounted Corps\\" after the 29th Dragoons. Due to the success of Abercrombie's expedition, the Royal Wagon Train of five Squadrons was reinforced by a further seven Squadrons/troops and Hamilton was promoted to Major General. The train was required because civilian transport was controlled by the Treasury rather than the military, which did not always suit the army's requirements. It was more sophisticated than the existing transport used by the Army Medical Department and was able to ferry many of the wounded, injured and sick to safety in large convoys. However, the convoys were limited by the technology of the age; wagons were prone to breakdown and often unable to cope with rough and torturous terrain of the battlefield and lines of communication. The animals pulling the wagons frequently died of starvation or exhaustion. Peninsular War The Train was heavily involved in the Peninsular War, supporting Sir Arthur Wellesley's forces as they sailed from Ireland to retake the French naval base at Lisbon in 1808. After command of the British forces temporarily passed to Sir John Moore in the winter of 1809, the Train was again involved, shepherding the wounded and transporting supplies for British forces in the retreat at Corunna; a trek through treacherous conditions that ended in a triumphant battle against Napoleon‚Äôs forces. Moore did not survive the battle, but his tactics and planning allowed many of his forces to evacuate Spain and set sail for England. At Wellington's request, Commissary General John Bissett was then brought in to oversee the Royal Waggon Train. By 1810, newly anointed Viscount Wellington had ordered the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras; a series of secret forts that repelled an offensive by French commander Andr√© Mass√©na. Other key successes at the Siege of Badajoz between March and April 1812, the Battle of Salamanca in July of the same year, and the Storming of Saint Sebastian in August 1813 allowed Wellington's forces to drive Napoleon's forces back into France. The Royal Waggon Train was responsible for transporting supplies and wounded during these key battles and throughout the Peninsula War. With public opinion against him, Emperor Napoleon was forced to abdicate on 31 March 1814, leading to his exile on the island of Elba. For its efforts in the Peninsula War, the Royal Waggon Train was awarded the battle honour \\"Peninsula\\", and over thirty officers were also awarded the bar \\"Corunna\\" for the Army Gold Medal. Waterloo After Napoleon's exile, the Royal Waggon Train was reduced to five Troops. However, a year later Napoleon escaped Elba and resumed power, rekindling hostilities with the British. Plans to rebuild the Train were fast- tracked; Wellington well-aware of its importance to military success overseas. The Train expanded once more to twelve Troops, which included 1,400 horses. On 18 June 1815, allied British and Prussian forces faced Napoleon's army at the Battle of Waterloo. Eight companies from the Royal Waggon Train were involved, along with four companies of the Foreign Waggon Train. During the battle, allied forces took up defence of Hougoumont, a chateau and farm south of Waterloo. Along with supporting the front lines, the Royal Waggon Train drove much-needed supplies through enemy lines to the desperate Third Guard defending the chateau. The Train's heroics at Hougoumont were included in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1891 play Waterloo. Wellington's forces were outnumbered and outgunned, withstanding a barrage of attacks from French forces throughout the day. That evening, Prussian forces led by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher broke through Napoleon's right flank. This planned attack allowed Britain and her remaining allied forces to counter-attack, driving the French Army from the battlefield. For their service during the battle, the Royal Waggon Train received their second battle honour: \\"Waterloo\\" Victory at Waterloo brought an end to the Napoleonic Wars, and with it, 22 years of conflict between France and much of Europe. After the battle, the Royal Waggon Train was responsible for clearing over 4,000 allied dead from the battlefield. Napoleon abdicated shortly after and was exiled on Saint Helena, a mid-Atlantic island, where he remained until his death in 1821. Following Napoleon's defeat, the Train was reduced to five troops, primarily utilised for mundane transport tasks. By 1818, only two troops remained, with one stationed in Gibraltar. The Train was finally disbanded in 1833. Legacy Ceremonial Officers Sabretaches 1812 used at Croydon A prolonged peace followed for Britain, until the beginning of the Crimean War in 1854. After the Train's disbandment, logistical support fell solely onto the Commissariat's shoulders. British forces suffered, as the refined infrastructure of the Royal Waggon Train was no more. This truly goes to show that the Royal Waggon Train is one of the unsung heroes of the Napoleonic Wars. The Headquarters of the Royal Waggon Train is at Croydon and two hundred years later it is still the headquarters of 151 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps.

The Second Mixed Brigade (),SBHAC - Brigadas Mixtas del Ej√©rcito Popular, 2¬™ Brigada MixtaCarlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999 was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in October 1936 as a result of the reorganization of the Spanish Republican Armed forces. The mouthpiece of the 2nd Mixed Brigade were the \\"Nuevo Horizonte\\" and \\"Victoria\\" newspapers. History The Second Mixed Brigade was established on 13 October 1936 in Ciudad Real with Extremaduran militias and railroad workers as well as standard troops that had been previously garrisoned in Madrid. It was placed under the 7th Division of the II Army Corps. The command of the unit was entrusted to Major Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez de Arag√≥n and its commissar was Felipe G√≥mez Hernando. =Defence of Madrid= On 15 November the Second Mixed Brigade set out by railway towards Madrid. It arrived at Huerta in two separate groups and continued on foot until reaching the area between Oca√±a and Noblejas onward to the first line of fire. On 17 November it was sent by General Miaja as a reserve unit at the front of the Ciudad Universitaria where it had to face the feared Regulares African troops.Jules Stewart, Madrid: The History, I. B. Tauris, 2013, Made up of a machine-gun company and three infantry companies, the 2 mixed brigade covered repeatedly the vanguard of the sector between the southern wall of the Casa de Campo and the Puerta del √Ångel. In the Ciudad Universitaria battle the 2nd mixed brigade suffered so many losses that it had to be withdrawn in March 1937 in order to be regrouped. After the regrouping it became part of the 10th Division of the I Army Corps. From 9 to 14 April the brigade was sent to an attack against the Cerro Garabitas that did not achieve any positive result but caused multiple casualties, among them the death of its commander Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez de Arag√≥n. He was replaced by Militia Major Jos√© Gallego P√©rez, formerly of the Military Engineering Corps, who led one of the battalions. Owing to the many losses the brigade had to be reassembled again. The 2nd Mixed Brigade took part in the Battle of Brunete, where on 7 July it secured Villanueva del Pardillo, maneuvering between the Aulencia and Guadarrama Rivers. The following day it took part in the storming of the Villafranca Castle, after which it went to relieve troops of the 31st Division in the Villanueva de la Ca√±ada sector. Following the scant success of the unit at the Battle of Brunete Commander Jos√© Gallego was replaced by Militia Major Ignacio Esnaola Iraola and the 2nd Brigade returned to the frontline of the Defence of Madrid in the Monte Panarra sector where it remained, almost without interruption until spring 1938. =Eastern Front= The Francoist Aragon Offensive had devastating effects on the Spanish Republican military for the rebel armies eastward thrust reached the coastal town of Vinar√≤s and broke the Spanish Republican territory in two. Following these events the 2nd Mixed Brigade was sent to the Eastern Front (Frente de Levante). Its aim was to cut across the Maestrazgo ranges in order to try to hinder the progress of General Aranda's troops. By 22 April it covered the sector Vilafranca-Cantavieja-La Iglesuela del Cid, where its troops were decimated by the rebels. Following the heavy loss of lives the 2nd Mixed Brigade had suffered in the harsh mountain area, it was unfit for battle action and was sent to a defensive position in the Eastern Front until the end of the year in order to be rebuilt. =Extremaduran Front and end of the brigade= In the first half of January 1939 the somewhat rebuilt brigade was integrated in the 64th Division of the XVII Army Corps and was sent west to the Sierra Morena in the Hinojosa del Duque-Valsequillo sector of the Extremaduran front line. The unit's renewed command structure consisted of Militia Major Carlos Cornejo as commander, Infantry Captain Joaqu√≠n Segado S√°nchez as Chief of Staff and Antonio Jim√©nez Soler, a member of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) as commissar. Its mission was to obstruct the enemy encirclement of the loyalist troops who were trapped in the Valsequillo pocket. Once in the combat area the 2nd Mixed Brigade attacked the rebel armies in Sierra Trapera and in Mocitas-Mataborrachas in the border area between Extremadura and NW Andalusia.Mataborrachas, Espa√±a - Nombres Geogr√°ficos In the height of the battle it was sent towards the inner area of the pocket in order to cover the withdrawal of the trapped Republican units. In these combat actions the Second Mixed Brigade had to bear so many losses that its size had to be reduced to two battalions for the second time in its history. Subsequently the brigade was gathered in Santa Eufemia, Andalusia, in order to recover and eventually to be re-established, but by then it was the last month of the war and its final fate is unknown, although it seems that it returned to the Eastern Front.

The main focus is to promote adult learning and access to and participation in non-formal adult education for all, particularly for groups currently under-represented. EAEA aims at influencing EU policies on non-formal adult education and lifelong learning and cooperates with the institutions of the European Union and with international organisations as the Council of Europe, the International Council for Adult Education (ICAE) and UNESCO. History Previously known as the European Bureau for Adult Education, EAEA has its roots in the Folk high schools in Europe, and in particular in those of the Netherlands. In the first years after the Second World War, the Netherlands Folk high school movement saw it as its mission to strive for a Europe wide cooperation of Folk high schools. The \\"Centre Europ√©en de la Culture\\" established in 1949 in Geneva developed, under the directorship of Denis de Rougemont, the idea of having a number of \\"Foyers de Culture\\" throughout Europe in and through which European culture in its diversity and unity could be experienced and spread. Oscar Guermonprez, director of the Bergen Folk high school in the Netherlands, imagined in this context an office for documentation and information, with an advisory council representing the whole field of adult education. The European Bureau for Adult Education was founded in 1953 by representatives from a number of European countries. The Bureau was formally established in Bergen, hosted by the Agency for European Folk high school work. Oscar Guermonprez was the first President. The main roles/ activities EAEA‚Äôs main roles: * Policy advocacy for lifelong learning at a European level; * Development of practice through projects, publications and training; * Provision of information and services for members; * International co-operation.

The EAEA Grundtvig Award was launched in 2003 by EAEA in order to celebrate excellence in adult education. Each year the Award has a different theme. The Award is named after Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig (1783‚Äì1872), a Danish educator mainly influential in the development of non-formal adult education in Europe and worldwide. He provided the adult education sector a foundational philosophy that underpins much of the work in lifelong learning and laid the ground work for the development of learning centres, in all kinds of contexts, from residential educational institutions to agricultural co-operatives. Younger Staff Training  EAEA organises an annual training \\"European Adult Education and Lifelong Learning ‚Äì Introduction for younger staff\\". The objectives are to learn about European developments in adult education and lifelong learning, to exchange information and knowledge about each other's organisations, to understand advocacy work at European level and adult education backgrounds, to learn about EAEA and other key civil society organisations.

It was Murphy who discovered the GAMA construction scandal, which was subsequently raised in D√°il √âireann and led to nationwide strikes. Political career Murphy contested his first general election, for the Dublin South-West constituency, in 1997, finishing in ninth position. He was a candidate for the same constituency at the 2002, 2007 and 2011 general elections, finishing in seventh position. He spent three weeks in Mountjoy Prison in 2003 for his role in the Anti-Bin Tax Campaign. It was Murphy who, upon travelling to Lucan to support three BATU workers in October 2004, discovered the GAMA construction scandal where Turkish workers were paid ‚Ç¨2 an hour on publicly funded projects. After contacting the local council, GAMA and trade union officials and remaining unenlightened, Murphy wrote a leaflet in English, had it translated into Turkish \\"mainly to say that we had no problem with them being here, and saying what GAMA had said\\", then threw it over the hoarding surrounding the site where the men were living as well as working. When the truth emerged, Murphy \\"knew immediately we had a major scandal\\", he later said. Murphy brought it to the attention of his party colleague Joe Higgins, who was then a TD for Dublin West, and Higgins raised the matter in D√°il √âireann on 8 February 2005, bringing public awareness to the workers' plight.Ibid. During the 2010s, Murphy was to the fore in the Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes. On 9 February 2015, while travelling to work from his Whitechurch, Rathfarnham home, Garda√≠ arrested him in relation to his part in the Jobstown protest the previous November--during which T√°naiste Joan Burton was reluctant to leave her car for two hours--and took him into custody along with three other anti-austerity activists. He was released without charge later that afternoon and told RT√â's Liveline radio show that while in custody he was shown garda vehicle and helicopter surveillance videos of the incident. The arrests led to accusations of \\"political policing\\". As Tallaght Central representative he opposed the Tallaght Town Centre Development.

She had a performing career in Europe and the United States of America, settling in America and becoming a teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. She was the mother of the conductor Boris Goldovsky and the sister of the pianist Pierre Luboshutz and the cellist, Anna Luboshutz. Early life Born in Odessa, Ukraine, her first teacher was her father. Her mother supported the family by selling pianos. A child prodigy, Lea gave her first concert at the age of five and went on to study with Emil M≈Çynarski, a prot√©g√© of Leopold Auer. When Auer came to Odessa, he was so impressed that he invited the eight-year-old child to come to study with him in Saint Petersburg, but the family could not afford to send and maintain Lea there. Two siblings came at about this time ‚Äì Anna (who became a cellist) and Pierre, a pianist. Lea came to the Moscow Conservatory at age 11, on an invitation by Vasily Safonov, and ended her studies there winning the gold medal in May 1903. Her patron, Lazar Polyakov, purchased an Amati violin for her. Early career She quickly became well established in Moscow musical circles and began to tour in Russia and eastern Europe. At the age of sixteen, she met Onissim Goldovsky, a prominent and wealthy attorney active in political circles. Though married to the writer Rashel Khin, Goldovsky established a household with Luboshutz and the couple had three children though Goldovsky remaining married to Khin for the rest of his life. The Goldovsky/Luboshutz apartment became a gathering place for musicians and theatre people ‚Äì many visiting performers, including Pablo Casals, stayed there during tours to the City. During the summer of 1905, Lea went to Belgium for post-graduate studies with Eug√®ne Ysa√øe. Meanwhile, with her brother and sister, Lea formed the Luboshutz Trio that toured throughout Russia and played at Leo Tolstoy's state funeral. Lea also performed at the court of the Romanovs and appeared regularly in Russia and Europe with the basso Fyodor Chaliapin and in concerts organized by Serge Koussevitzky. Lea made her first trip to the United States in 1907 but her tour was cut short by pregnancy. The Russian Revolution, Berlin and Paris Following the Russian Revolution , Goldovsky and Luboshutz decided to emigrate and she departed, first going to Germany on a concert tour in 1921 with her 13-year-old son Boris serving as her accompanist, never to return. Onissim Goldovsky died the next year, not having managed to leave the Soviet Union. Living as a single mother in Berlin and then in Paris, she toured throughout Europe and, under impresario Sol Hurok‚Äôs banner, throughout the United States. There she introduced many new works to American audiences including playing the New York premiere of the first violin concerto of Serge Prokofiev with Ernst von Dohnanyi conducting the orchestra. Later career in the United States In 1924, she began touring internationally with the pianist, Josef Hofmann, and when he was subsequently appointed to the Directorship of the Curtis Institute of Music in 1927, he invited her to join the violin department, a post she held until 1947. After one of Luboshutz‚Äôs Carnegie Hall appearances, another wealthy patron, Aaron Naumburg, purchased a Stradivarius violin for her (the so-called ‚ÄúNightingale‚Äù). Her students included a concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra (Rafael Druian), seven members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and numerous others who went on to successful careers. She was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Curtis Institute of Music in 1953. A musical family Luboshutz's sister Anna became a celebrated cellist in the Soviet Union who was also a gold medal winner at the Moscow Conservatory. Her brother Pierre Luboshutz formed a well- known duo-piano team with his wife Genia Nemenoff. Her son, Boris Goldovsky, started his career as a pianist but became an opera impresario and teacher. Two grandsons, Andrew and Thomas Wolf, also had careers in music.

These trailers are used extensively throughout the United States to transport agricultural products as well as any other commodity that can be hauled in bulk and loaded and unloaded through the trailer. Design Grain hopper trailers typically feature a rolling tarp on the top of the trailer, to enable easy loading of the product to be transported, and also offer protection during transport. They utilize two hoppers on the base of the trailer to unload to product, one servicing the rear half of the trailer, the other the front half. The output of these hoppers is usually controlled by a sliding plate on the base of the hopper, controlled by a user-operated crank handle. Usage A grain hopper trailer is used in conjunction with various other pieces of agricultural machinery to complete the harvest of a field. Combine harvesters or similar unload the harvest into grain carts, which in turn unload their load into a grain hopper trailer, for long distance transportation. The trailers are then unloaded into low-profile grain augers for transportation to, and long-term storage in, grain bins, also known as silo's.

Two of his innovations, the breaker-type direct-coupled amplifier and the vacuum thermocouple, were essential to the development of infrared spectrometry technology. Among others, Liston has developed instruments for capnometry, the measurement of carbon dioxide in respiratory gases, used to monitor patients. He also developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions, essential to attempts to improve Los Angeles air quality in the 1950s. Early life and education  Max Davis Liston[https://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi- bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&dbid;=2238&h;=267455873&tid;=&pid;=&usePUB;=true&_phsrc=OzZ6777&_phstart=successSource Ancestry: Max Davis Liston in the U.S. WWII Draft Cards Young Men, 1940-1947] was born on March 16, 1918 in Oswego, Kansas, United States to Virdon (or Verdon) Milne Liston and Madge Ruth Davis. He had an older sister, Lorene. His father was a superintendent of schools. Liston attended high school in Fort Scott, Kansas. Because the science options there were limited, he took summer classes in physics at Northwestern University. Liston received a B.A. in electrical engineering with a minor in communications (electronics) from the University of Minnesota in 1940. In his junior year he wrote a paper on \\"Modulation of incandescent lamps\\", winning an IEEE prize. In his senior year he wrote a \\"Study of the negative transconductance of pentodes\\". He was the first undergraduate to be admitted into the University of Minnesota Sigma Psi chapter. Hired by the Chrysler Corporation, he worked at Chrysler from 1940 to 1942, receiving his M.S. in mechanical engineering in 1941 through an innovative work-study program, the Chrysler Institute of Engineering. He developed a bonded strain gauge pressure sensor, modifying a previous Pullman Company design, and presented the work to the American Automotive Society. War-time work  In 1942 Liston joined General Motors. A number of projects at GM were related to World War II, and involved researchers in other companies, universities and government. Initially Liston worked with a group led by Charles F. Kettering at GM to develop a sensor to detect submarines and with Harrison M. Randall of the University of Michigan on the improvement of infrared spectroscopy equipment for analysis of high-octane Triptane aviation fuel. In 1943, Liston developed the breaker-type direct-coupled amplifier. This allowed a signal to be sent directly from a thermocouple to a recording device. It was initially classified as top-secret because of its use in military applications. These included submarine detection instruments, heat- tracking sensors for experimental glide bombs, oximeters for high-altitude aviation, and instruments to measure thermal radiation released in atomic bomb tests for the Manhattan Project. Liston published a paper on the d.c. amplifier in 1954. Through his war work, Liston met James Elam and George Saxton. He also met August Herman Pfund of Johns Hopkins University, who had patented both early positive and negative IR-analyzers. While visiting the Naval Research Laboratories, Liston was able to identify positive type infrared analyzers which had been brought back from Germany at the end of the war. When GM and Dupont decided to build their own spectrophotometers, Liston and David Frye from GM apprenticed with Harrison Randall at the University of Michigan to learn more about spectrophotometry. They then helped Dr. Downing at Dupont Experimental Station to build a spectrophotometer for use in petrochemical classification and plastics research. To further improve GM's spectrophotometer, Liston worked with Charles Morris Reeder to develop a vacuum thermocouple that eliminated the problem of thermal drift in spectroscopy measurements. The breaker-type direct-coupled amplifier and the vacuum thermocouple became essential contributions to the development of infrared spectrometry technology.  Perkin Elmer  In 1946, Richard Scott Perkin recruited Liston to join Perkin-Elmer as a chief engineer. Liston, John U. White, Van Zandt Williams and Vincent J. Coates formed the double-beam spectrophotometer research group. Liston's breaker amplifier and the Reeder thermocouple were incorporated into designs for the Perkin-Elmer Model 12 single-beam and Model 21 double-beam spectrophotometers, which became extremely successful. Liston-Becker  In 1950, Morris Folb and Max Liston formed the Liston-Folb company, focusing on the development of nondispersive infrared analyzers. In 1951, they received backing from Albert Austin and Richard S. Becker, who created the Liston-Becker Instrument Company to handle instrument sales. The Liston-Becker plant was located in Springdale, Connecticut. They developed and sold the Model 16 capnograph and Mark II and Mark III atmospheric analyzers for the US Navy's submarines. =Capnometry = Liston's initial development work on the capnograph occurred before the formation of Liston-Folb. Capnometry is the measurement of the concentration of carbon dioxide () in the respiratory gases, an important monitoring tool for patients undergoing anesthesia and in intensive care. Liston-Becker was one of a number of companies seeking to develop instruments to measure using infrared absorption. Soon after leaving Perkin-Elmer, Liston was approached by Drs. James Elam and George Saxton, who he had met doing war work, to build a analyzer to test their theories about causes of cardiac arrest in anesthesia patients. In 1951, Liston provided Elam with a prototype nondispersive infrared analyzer, which Elam used in his human respiratory physiology research at Barnes Hospital and Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. After relocating to Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) in Buffalo in 1953, Elam used a newer Liston-Becker model analyzer in his research. With Liston's apparatus, Elam was able to make important contributions to the study of respiratory physiology, and substantial improvements to anesthesia machines. The color indicators on the instruments were not working properly, allowing patients to inhale high levels of dangerous undetected, and a valve in the apparatus tended to stick and cause rebreathing. Once identified, both problems were fixed. Liston also provided prototypes to Dr. Philip Drinker of Harvard Medical School, to Dr. John Wendell Severinghaus of Johns Hopkins University, and to Dr. J. L. Whittenberger. Liston's first sale was to Dr. Julius H. Comroe, Jr. at the University of Pennsylvania. Initially the medical spectrophotometer had a mask-style attachment, into which the patient breathed. This was later modified to use a nasal catheter because many polio patients could not use the mouth-breathing apparatus. Eventually the Polio Foundation began to use Liston's Model 16 CO2 analyzer to monitor Iron Lung machines, cutting in half both the time that patients spent in the machines and the death rate of Iron Lung machine users. Liston developed an industrial analyzer in response to a request from Dupont. The industrial analyzer performed similar types of analysis, but was built in an explosive-proof case to meet industrial safety requirements. The Model 15 had a cheap metal case and could be used for non-explosive laboratory work. =Atmospheric analysis = Beckman Instruments Mark V Atomic Submarine Atmosphere Analyzer, 1965 By 1958, Liston-Becker had also delivered several atmospheric-analyzer models for the US Navy's submarines, some of which were tested on the USSN Nautilus, the first atomic-powered submarine. The Navy was interested in monitoring the air quality on submarines during long submersion, particularly the presence of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oxygen and Freon. Liston-Becker redesigned a Pauling Oxygen meter from Beckman Instruments for the oxygen detection. The final atmospheric analyzer had to pass Navy tests for measuring air quality, withstanding shock, and tilt sensitivity. Liston-Becker's first atmosphere analyzers were the Mark II, built in 1953, and the Mark III, built in 1954. Fourteen Mark III analyzers were sold to the Navy, for $75,000 each. After the Beckman Instruments company took over Liston-Becker, Beckman continued the development of the Mark IV and Mark V. Beckman Instruments In 1955, Liston's backers, Albert Austin and Richard S. Becker, agreed to sell their company to Beckman Instruments. Max Liston joined Beckman Instruments, Inc. in 1955 and remained with the company until 1965, initially as manager of Liston-Becker. After the Connecticut-based Liston-Becker plant was closed in a reorganization in 1958, Liston became Beckman Instruments Director of Engineering in California. =Smog analysis= Arnold Beckman lived in Altadena, California and had a strong interest in solving the smog issue. One of Liston's most significant projects at Beckman Instruments involved automobile-emissions analyzers for smog tests in L.A. In 1952, Arie Jan Haagen-Smit presented results that suggested that car exhausts were a major contributor to the development of California smog. In 1956 the city of Los Angeles conducted emissions tests to determine whether cars were to blame for the smog of Los Angeles. Determining the effects of automobiles required the development of a mobile instrument capable of measuring smog and automobile emissions. The Liston-Becker Model 28 could be put in the back of a car and powered by batteries in the trunk. The city tested 1000 cars, owned by local businesses, at the Los Angeles riverbed. Seven Liston analyzers were used in the tests. The emissions tests revealed that many of the test cars had poorly maintained V8 engines. The engines' cylinders fired poorly and in some cases raw fuel escaped. The experimenters also discovered that the smog in L.A. caused varnish to form in the automobiles‚Äô carburetors, changing the fuel-to- air ratio. The Model 28 and Model 30 emissions analyzers were sold to major U.S. auto manufacturers such as Chrysler and General Motors and used for the inspection and servicing of automobiles. Liston also worked with Haagen-Smit on equipment for monitoring from power stacks and refineries. While at Beckman Instruments, Liston helped to develop the Mark IV submarine analyzer. He also developed the first pulse oximeter, but Beckman Instruments was not interested in marketing it. Liston retired from the company in 1965, not long after Arnold Beckman stepped down as president of the company.  Liston Scientific  After leaving Beckman Instruments, Liston continued to work on a variety of projects with various partners, eventually forming Liston Scientific, of which he became president. One project was to improve the design of medical respirators, which were of interest to Forrest Bird, Dr. Albert Starr and Miles \\"Lowell\\" Edwards of Edwards Lifesciences. Liston believed he could create a ventilator with an integrated circuit to detect when the patient was able to breathe on his own, automatically switching between a preset ventilation rate and a patient-dependent one as needed. He was able to develop such an instrument for Edwards. Another project, involving Miles Edwards, Jr. was the development of an Instrument Positive Pressure Breathalyzer (IPPB) for treating asthma patients. Liston's design was known as the Handi-Vent IPPB. It was later licensed to Ohio Medical Products. SmithKline approached Liston to improve the design of its spectrophotometer. They needed a machine that could meet tight specifications, for analyzing reagents in temperature-dependent rate reactions. Liston's design and 35 prototypes made by Edward Murphy were accepted by SmithKline. Liston Scientific completed its part of the project in 1966, helping to set up the Corbin-Farnsworth factory for production. Liston's design was manufactured by SmithKline as the Alpha spectrophotometer, part of a system called the Escalab. In 1966 and 1967, Liston developed a Digital- Alpha circuit to calculate the logarithmic decay of a capacitor-resistor. The circuit was patented by Liston Scientific in 1967. It was used in bichromatic analyzers which Liston designed for Abbott Laboratories, beginning with the ABA-100. The ABA-100 was a single-reagent double-channel kinetic analyzer for ultra-micro chemical analysis and simultaneous bichromatic spectrophotometry. One module of the instrument performed the chemical processing, dispensing the reagent and sample for the reaction and performing the spectrophotometry measurements. A second module monitored and controlled the processing module and calculated and reported results. Later models incorporated specialty microprocessors instead of memory chips. Liston was interested in developing a multi-channel unit which could handle multiple tests at once, and which would incorporate a sample-identification system to prevent identification errors. When Abbott was not interested in it, Liston went on to develop the Paramax clinical analyzer for Baxter International. Liston developed instruments that used selective binding of fluorescent tags and subsequent photodetection for the examination of chemical compounds. One instrument was designed to test blood samples for steroids and other drugs. Liston also developed specialty test instruments for electrolyte testing, Hemoccult testing, glucose testing and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) analysis. He is an innovator in the area of chemical-luminescence instrumentation, particularly measurement of oxides of nitrogen. In addition, Liston and Lowell Edwards formed the Liston-Edwards company to work on the measurement of hydrocarbons. They developed an emissions analyzer that detected photo-reactive gases, ignoring non-reactive gases.

She first appears in the 2009 novel The Stolen Throne as the Witch of the Wilds, a notorious sorceress who resides in the Korcari Wilds region within the Kingdom of Ferelden in the world of Thedas, and provides conditional aid to the novel's main characters when they pass through the Wilds. She next appears in the 2009 video game Dragon Age: Origins, which is set several decades after the events of The Stolen Throne, and again aids the story's protagonists. She is voiced by American actress Kate Mulgrew for all media. Within the Dragon Age series, Flemeth is a recurring supporting character with few overall appearances in the games, though she plays a pivotal part in the series' overarching narrative. The character has received an overall positive reception; praise went to her cryptic nature and morally ambiguous personality, as well as her voice acting. Flemeth has been cited as a notable example of a complex and interesting older female character in video games. Conception and creation Flemeth was created and written by David Gaider. He intentionally wrote Flemeth as an aloof and whimsical character who talks in circles, and rarely provides the individual who converses with her a straight answer. Gaider originally intended for the game's origin story to have a historical framing which is narrated as a story by an old woman; the player would initially think it is Flemeth, only for her to be revealed as an elderly Morrigan by the end of the story. Gaider considers the resolution of the Morrigan and Flemeth plot in Dragon Age: Inquisition to be the most complex video game scene he has ever written, as it had \\"three overlapping variants and juggled a lot of different needs\\". Flemeth's visual design received a complete overhaul from Dragon Age II onwards. Character artist Francis Lacuna remarked that her redesign \\"seemed a gamble at first, going from a crazy old lady living in a shoe to a crazy old lady who can turn into a dragon, eat Darkspawn for breakfast and is also kind of a hot babe...which is disturbing and awful and at the same time ‚Äì awesome!\\". Kate Mulgrew considers Origins to be very well written, \\"epic, dark, and brutal\\" in tone, and \\"there‚Äôs an intelligence and a depth\\" that she does not see very often in other video games. She described Flemeth as a mysterious witch who is a richly textured and transcendent character, noting that the player has to \\"stay with the game and stay with the character to discover just how mysterious she is\\". Mulgrew alluded to undercurrents and secrets surrounding the character which drew from her past experiences of loss and despair, though she remarked that \\"it is not all dark\\" as in time \\"her history reveals itself as she reveals herself\\". When asked to compare Flemeth to other characters she has played in a 2009 interview, Mulgrew replied that they do not have her depth, or magnitude, or discipline; to her, Flemeth is not a mere witch but \\"a very advanced kind of character\\" with a profound personal history, which she brings to bear on the choices she makes and the intriguing things she say. In a 2014 interview, Mulgrew elaborates on the character's morally ambiguous nature. alt= Mulgrew spoke positively of her experience working with BioWare as Flemeth's voice actress on a number of occasions. For Mulgrew, acting without cameras, makeup or costumes and with only a script and a sound engineer to assist her was a liberating experience. She liked the range she was allowed to have with Flemeth, \\"from her very darkest tones to moments of almost girlishness\\", or \\"going from fury to confidence, and confidence to reflection\\". She described the vocal dexterity required to capture the darkness of the character to be \\"challenging and very freeing...almost joyful to go that deep\\". Having possessed context and insight into the character's motivations and true nature, Mulgrew felt she could \\"grasp her fury and her power in a different way\\", and noted that \\"there's a sense of great adult play\\". Mulgrew herself is not a gamer, though she indicates that this is to her benefit as it allows her to be completely detached to the character she plays. Mulgrew opined that to portray Flemeth, she cannot \\"really have any kind of stake in this game at all, except the stake of her reality.\\" =Character= As part of the character's backstory, she is the eponymous subject of several Ferelden legends, many of which explain how she became the Witch of the Wilds, a sobriquet given to her by the superstitious locals of the Korcari Wilds. A few versions recount the tale of her husband or lover being murdered by a jealous rival; in her grief and rage she became possessed by a vengeful spirit and committed mass murder before fleeing into the Korcari Wilds, where she has remained ever since. The character is described as full of rage, which emanated from what happened to her \\"when she was a young and very beautiful woman, and had to pay the price for a love that she once had\\". Within the series, Flemeth alternates between maternal, antagonistic, and ambiguous personas in each of her appearances. Flemeth is said to offer aid to petitioners and supplicants who seek her, but rarely in the way one expects. The Chasind barbarians call Flemeth \\"The Mother of Vengeance\\", a capricious being that only the truly desperate would consider turning towards for help, and often paint her in the motif of a great dragon or serpent; she in fact possesses the ability to transform into a large and extremely powerful dragon. She is noted for her longevity or even immortality; to the Dalish elves, she is known as \\"Asha'bellanar\\", or the woman of many years. She is said to have many daughters, all of whom are witches like their mother; two notable ones are Morrigan, who lives with her in the Korcari Wilds until the events of Origins, and Yavana who appears in the comic series Dragon Age: The Silent Grove and lives in Antiva's Teleri Swamps. Flemeth has a strained relationship with Morrigan, who is unsure if the witch is actually her birth mother. A subplot which revolve around Morrigan's complicated relationship with her mother in Origins involves her potential discovery of Flemeth's grimoire, which reveals her method of extending her unnaturally long lifespan by possessing her daughters' bodies. Flemeth is noted for her willingness to aid the various protagonists of the Dragon Age series. Janine Hawkins from Paste Magazine noted that Flemeth is generally indifferent about anything that does not directly concern her, but she presents herself as a powerful ally on several occasions. Besides saving the protagonist of Origins at the Battle of Ostagar, she also guides the Hawke family to Kirkwall, which sets the events of Dragon Age II in motion, and she also provides the Inquisition insight on how to defeat Corypheus in Inquisition. Her true motivations for providing aid remains unknown and mysterious, along with the truth of her relationship with Morrigan. Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer commented that, \\"whether Morrigan or Flemeth can be trusted is a lingering question, as they always seem to have ulterior motives\\". Flemeth's accent points towards a prestigious General American accent, and her speech is rhotic with her consistent pronunciation of the phoneme /r/ at the end of words and before consonants. Appearances Flemeth's first appears in The Stolen Throne as the mysterious Witch of the Wilds, who allows Maric and Loghain safe passage through the Korcari Wilds. She provides this help on the condition that Maric makes her an unspecified promise. She prophesied to Maric that a Blight will one day come to Ferelden and that Loghain will betray him if he keeps him close, \\"each time worse than the last\\". In Origins, she is first encountered by the latest Grey Wardens recruits of Ferelden, where she hands over a set of ancient treaties and provides advice for their future. She later rescues the player character and Alistair from Ostagar, and commands her daughter Morrigan to accompany them on their subsequent journeys. As part of Morrigan's personal quest, the Warden may choose to attack Flemeth and fight her in her High Dragon form, or simply allowing her to leave in peace and take her grimoire. Towards the end of the game, Morrigan reveals that Flemeth had instructed her to offer the Wardens a dark ritual prior to their confrontation with the Archdemon; as long as Morrigan has made the necessary preparations and is impregnated with a child who will then carry the soul of the Archdemon upon being slain, the life of the Grey Warden who dealt the final death blow to the Archdemon will be spared, her goal being to preserve an \\"Old God\\" soul within the Archdemon. The player has the option to decline the ritual, or acquiesce to Morrigan's offer by having a male Warden character copulate with her. In Dragon Age II, Flemeth saves the Hawke family along with Aveline Vallen from the darkspawn as they attempt to escape the Blight in Lothering, and implores them to deliver an amulet to the Dalish Keeper Marethari at Sundermount near Kirkwall. Later in the game it is revealed that regardless of what happened in Origins, she ensured her survival through the amulet which the Dalish elves in Sundermount then use to restore her. She warns Hawke and company that the world is about to change before departing. In Dragon Age: Inquisition, she provides the Inquisitor and Morrigan with guidance on how to defeat Corypheus. If Morrigan's son Kieran exists, Flemeth meets with him and, if he has the Old God soul, extracts it. If Kieran does not exist, Flemeth is only curious to see who drank from the Well of Sorrows. In all cases, she reveals that she is possessed by the remnants of the elven goddess Mythal's spirit, and that she has apparently been working throughout the centuries to secure the goddess the justice that was denied to her. In the post-credits scene of Inquisition, Flemeth meets Solas, who is revealed to be the elven god Fen'harel. She is then petrified and had her power, and possibly the soul of the Old God, drained by Solas, leaving her fate unknown. Promotion and merchandise Flemeth, as both a humanoid and a dragon, is featured prominently in promotional material, advertisements, and cover art for Dragon Age II. Mulgrew, in character as Flemeth, was the narrator of the official Dragon Age II cinematic trailer released in August 2010. Flemeth's dragon form was recreated by sculptor Joe Menna, with input from BioWare, in the form of a statue at 4.5\\" tall and 12\\" wide. Reception Flemeth has received a positive reception; her enigmatic, transcendant nature has prompted discussions about unresolved stories and sub-plots which involves her within series lore, even after the character's apparent death in Inquisition. In her 2015 research paper published in the Journal of Comparative Research in Anthropology and Sociology, Elisabeta Toma argued that Flemeth is a notable elderly female video game character with power and agency, who subverts many associated gender and age stereotypes in video games or exploits them for her own purposes. Hawkins wrote that Flemeth is a very distinctive older female video game character as she is \\"not fragile or terribly kind, nor is she evil and merciless\\". In her thesis titled \\"The Broodmother as Monstrous- Feminine‚ÄîAbject Maternity in Video Games\\", Sarah Stang suggested that Flemeth's various identities as a mother figure, an older woman, a witch, and a shapeshifter corresponds to the aspects of the monstrous feminine figure as proposed by Stang, though Stang felt the character is an interesting subversion as she is not presented as simply another monster to be slain. Russ Fruschtick praised Mulgrew for her articulate explanation of Flemeth's character; he found it rare that voice actors are as committed as Mulgrew to the roles they play, and concluded that BioWare chose \\"the perfect actress to handle such a compelling character\\" with the intensity and passion she displays. Andrei Dumitrescu from Softpedia said Mulgrew delivered \\"superb\\" voice acting for the character. Carol Pinchefsky from Syfy enjoyed Mulgrew's performance as Flemeth, as it reminds her of Mulgrew's previous role as Arachnia, Queen of the Spider People, in the Star Trek: Voyager episode ‚ÄúBride of Chaotica!.‚Äù Flemeth's redesigned appearance is well received, being a popular subject for fan art, cosplay and other forms of fan labor. Hawkins commented that Flemeth's costume is \\"simultaneously plain and imposing, modest and yet sexually-charged\\", a visual representation of her characteristics which is lacking in most older female characters depicted in popular media. The boss fight with Flemeth as a dragon in Origins has been noted by Tom's Hardware and Den of Geek for its high difficulty. Analysis In her thesis titled \\"Literature and Contemporary Media: Campbell's Monomyth in video game trilogies Dragon Age and Mass Effect\\", Ana Mediƒá identified Flemeth as corresponding to the Mother Goddess archetype of Joseph Campbell's monomyth: she is a hag who is possessed by an elven goddess, renews herself by taking over the bodies of her daughters, and takes the form of a dragon. In an essay published in Ctrl-Alt-Play: Essays on Control in Video Gaming, Karl Babij cited the conflict between Morrigan and Flemeth in Origins, with the player character being asked to choose between slaying Flemeth or sparing her and deceiving Morrigan as an example of a truly ethical game structure; since the player must deal with the consequences of their actions as the sole moral agent in the absence of any obvious notion of good or evil, this allows them to exercise full control over the ethics of the given situation.

It is a significant financial market infrastructure in China. As planned, CIPS will be developed in two phases. On 8 October 2015, CIPS (Phase I) went live. The first batch of direct participants includes 19 Chinese and foreign banks which were set up in mainland China and 176 indirect participants which cover 6 continents and 47 countries and regions. On 25 March 2016, CIPS signed an MoU with SWIFT with mutual understanding of deploying SWIFT as a secure, efficient and reliable communication channel for CIPS's connection with SWIFT's members, which would provide a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardised and reliable environment. CIPS is sometimes referred to as the China Interbank Payment System. CIPS would not facilitate funds transfer; rather, it sends payment orders, which must be settled by correspondent accounts that the institutions have with each other. Each financial institution, to exchange banking transactions, must have a banking relationship by either being a bank or affiliating itself with one (or more) so as to enjoy those particular business features. However, it was reported in July 2015 that CIPS would be '\\"watered down\\" and used only for cross-border yuan trade deals rather than including capital-related transactions, which would delay billions of dollars' worth of transactions, including securities purchases and foreign direct investment, that would have gone through the system. It was reported to be a second setback to the plan to provide a unified network for settling deals in yuan after technical problems delayed its launch, and that other measures to open up China's financial infrastructure have been dented by the 2015 Chinese stock market crash. It was said to now offer, at best, a complementary network for settling trade-related deals in the Chinese currency to a current patchwork of Chinese clearing banks around the world.  Standards  CIPS is expected to use the SWIFT industry standard for syntax in financial messages. Messages formatted to SWIFT standards can be read by, and processed by, many well-known financial processing systems, whether or not the message traveled over the SWIFT network. SWIFT cooperates with international organizations for defining standards for message format and content. CIPS would conceivably also subscribe to registration authority (RA) for the following ISO standards: * ISO 9362: 1994 Banking‚ÄîBanking telecommunication messages‚ÄîBank identifier codes * ISO 10383: 2003 Securities and related financial instruments‚ÄîCodes for exchanges and market identification (MIC) * ISO 13616: 2003 IBAN Registry * ISO 15022: 1999 Securities‚ÄîScheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) (replaces ISO 7775) * ISO 20022-1: 2004 and ISO 20022-2:2007 Financial services‚ÄîUNIversal Financial Industry message scheme In RFC 3615 urn:swift: was defined as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) for SWIFT FIN.

Biography Degtyaryov was born in Vorkuta, Komi ASSR on 16 August 1958. He first represented the Soviet Union in a major international meet at the 1982 European Championships in Athens, where he placed sixth; Track & Field News ranked him fifth in the world that year. In 1983 Degtyaryov won first at the Hypo-Meeting in G√∂tzis, and then at the Soviet Spartakiad; his Spartakiad score of 8538 points (on the 1962 scoring tables) was a new Soviet record. He entered the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki ranked third on season bests (behind J√ºrgen Hingsen and Siegfried Wentz, and ahead of eventual winner Daley Thompson), but dropped out of contention after four events; after an average start, he no-heighted in the high jump, missing three times at his opening height of 1.91 m.

In 1984 Degtyaryov repeated as both G√∂tzis champion and Soviet champion and also won at the Friendship Games in Moscow. At the Soviet Championships he scored his personal best and another Soviet record, 8652 points; after new scoring tables were introduced, this became 8698 points, which remains the Russian national record and ranks 18th on the world all-time list. Degtyaryov missed the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles due to the Soviet boycott, but was still ranked a career-best third in the world. Degtyaryov remained in good shape for two more years, ranking in the world's top 10 in both 1985 and 1986 and winning gold at the 1986 Goodwill Games, ahead of Soviet record holder Aleksandr Apaychev.

Based on the Swedish television series Det st√∂rsta √§ventyret (SV The Greatest Adventure), the premise of the programme is to drop celebrities into a hostile environment and leave them to fend for themselves. Filming began in February 2015, but was halted in early March following a helicopter crash that claimed the lives of ten people, including three of the contestants and five of the production crew. History Produced by Adventure Line Productions (ALP), and developed from the Swedish reality show Det st√∂rsta √§ventyret (The Great Adventure), the format of Dropped involves blindfolding several sports personalities, then dropping them at a remote location where they must use their survival skills to find their way back to civilisation. Contestants are split into two teams, which must then compete against each other, and have 72 hours to reach a location where they can charge and use a mobile phone. A promotional video explains the show's premise as: \\"Two teams are dropped into the middle of nowhere. No food. No map. No help.\\" Filming of the series began in late February in Ushuaia, a city in the far southern Patagonia region of Argentina. The cast included seven French athletes‚ÄîFlorence Arthaud, Alain Bernard, Philippe Candeloro, Jeannie Longo, Camille Muffat, Alexis Vastine, Sylvain Wiltord‚Äîand Swiss athlete Anne-Flore Marxer. By Monday 9 March, the show had moved to the province of La Rioja, and filming of the first episode was complete, with Wiltord having been eliminated from the process, and returned home to Paris. =Helicopter crash= At around 5.00 p.m. local time on 9 March 2015, and shortly after taking off near the town of Villa Castelli, two helicopters carrying some of the contestants and members of the film crew were involved in a mid-air collision and subsequent crash, which resulted in the deaths of all the contestants aboard both aircraft. On 10 March, the French Presidential Office confirmed the names of the deceased, which included three of the contestants, who were named as yachtswoman Florence Arthaud, Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat and Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine. The two helicopter pilots and five members of the film crew were confirmed as the other fatalities. In the wake of the incident, TF1 halted filming on the series, and announced that the show had been postponed. The series had been scheduled to air as part of the channel's Summer 2015 lineup, but speaking subsequently to TF1, the CEO of Adventure Line Productions, Franck Firmin-Guion, said that footage of the show would \\"not see the light of day\\" following the incident. ALP's website also removed the show from its list of productions. On 10 March, French prosecutors opened a manslaughter investigation, a standard procedure when the death of a French citizen occurs overseas. Officials in Argentina also launched an investigation into the incident, led by judge Daniel Herrera. After questioning the surviving contestants and production staff as part of his inquiry, Herrera gave them the go ahead to return home on 12 March. Alain Bernard, Philippe Candeloro, Jeannie Longo, Anne-Flore Marxer and the film crew boarded a flight from Buenos Aires on 13 March, returning to Paris the following day. They were greeted by friends and relatives, as well as the CEO of TF1, before leaving the airport separately. Forensic experts from France and Argentina announced they had officially identified the bodies of the deceased on 16 March. The incident‚Äîthe latest of a series of deaths to have occurred on film sets and reality shows‚Äîwas the second fatality involving an ALP production after a contestant died of a heart attack following a challenge on the survival show Koh-Lanta in 2013, and consequently reignited an ongoing debate about the safety of reality television shows. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Professor Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School suggested the accident demonstrates the dangers of the genre: \\"These reality shows try to outdo each other. They keep trying to push the envelope: The more dangerous the better. They do it for the entertainment value...at some point you have to say: Is this craziness or is this entertainment?\\" A report by TIME Magazines Vivienne Walt suggested a culture of low budget television prepared to take increasingly greater risks with its productions for dramatic effect may have resulted in this tragedy, and others. Musician Benjamin Biolay described the format as a \\"horrible TV reality show that serves up cardboard stars and then steals three wonderful athletes\\".

When first opened, it was a two-story clinic with four rooms. Today, it is a four-story, 50-bed facility that provides low-cost health services to the general public as well as to monks and nuns. The hospital provides both Western medicine and traditional medicine, including acupuncture. Location Wachet is a village in the Sagaing region of Upper Myanmar, along the Ayeyarwady River. The hospital is located north of the Kyaswa Monastery, west of the Sagaing Hills, and east of the Ayeyarwady River. Kyaswa Monastery and Sayadaw U Lakkhana The Kyaswa Monastery was founded in the 14th century and is located in Wachet. Sayadaw U Lakkhana, the founder of Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital, was the abbot of the monastery when the hospital was founded in 1984, and was known both in Myanmar and abroad as a meditation teacher and spiritual leader. He traveled extensively to lead Satipatthana meditation retreats, including in Australia, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, and the United States. In 1988, the Myanmar government awarded him the title of Agga Maha Kammathanacarriya, its highest honor for meditation instruction. The resulting publicity helped him garner support for community projects. In addition to founding Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital, Sayadaw U Lakkhana and the Kyaswa Monastery opened a primary school in Wachet, provided grants for students, and delivered humanitarian relief to civilians after Cyclone Nargis in 2008. Sayadaw U Lakkhana died in 2014. Facilities and services The hospital has 50 beds, but often accommodates up to 200 patients. In 2014, according to a hospital pamphlet, the average number of medical outpatients per month was 131. The average numbers of dental, ENT, and dermatological cases were 341, 59, and 34 per month, respectively. An average of 322 patients per month received acupuncture, and an average of 284 were treated with other forms of traditional medicine. There are about 50 permanent staff members, including one doctor, five nurses, nine paramedics, and five administrators. The hospital has three operating theatres, one laser treatment room in the outpatient department, and five dental chairs. Additional facilities include a laboratory, a radiology department, and a traditional medicine and acupuncture unit. Four air conditioned rooms with attached bathrooms, as well as five beds and bathrooms in the main hall, are reserved for VIP patients. The hospital provides a variety of health services throughout the week, but certain procedures that must be performed by specialists are only available during certain days and times. Physicians, surgeons, and dental surgeons from Mandalay are available Sunday mornings; the dental surgeons are also available on Saturdays. An acupuncture team from Mandalay provides services on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Eye specialists and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) teams from Mandalay come on Thursdays. For billing purposes, the hospital divides patients into three categories. Those in the first category, including monks, nuns, and yogis, receive treatment free of charge. Those in the second category‚Äîlow-income or otherwise disadvantaged patients‚Äîare responsible for a small portion of their treatment costs. All other patients are responsible for the total cost of their treatment, or most of it. Affiliated organizations Wachet does not receive funding from the Myanmar government. It is supported by donations and volunteers from both domestic and international organizations, including Japan Heart, the RANZCO Eye Foundation, the Brighter Future Foundation, and Vipassana Hawai‚Äôi. =Japan Heart= Japan Heart, a volunteer-based international health care organization based in Tokyo, was founded in 2004 by Dr. Hideto Yoshioka. The organization operates in both Myanmar and Cambodia, and began working with Wachet Hospital in May 2004. Japanese doctors and nurses assist local staff members in treating patients, and also work to improve the medical techniques used at the hospital. In Myanmar, Japan Heart volunteers help treat approximately 10,000 outpatients and perform up to 2,000 surgical operations per year. In 2004, its medical volunteers conducted, on average, 1,001 outpatient procedures and 154 operations per month. Its other initiatives in Myanmar include the Dream Development Center, or \\"Dream Train\\", a child development center in Yangon founded in 2010. Also in 2010, with funding from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan Heart opened a vocational training center for the visually impaired in Myanmar. =RANZCO Eye Foundation= The RANZCO Eye Foundation is a nonprofit organization, founded in 2002, that represents over 800 ophthalmologists in Australia and New Zealand. It funds a number of initiatives, including sustainable eye care programs in disadvantaged communities in both countries, research on the causes of vision loss, and community awareness campaigns about eye health. It works with Wachet Hospital on the Myanmar Eye Care Project (MECP), which aims to reduce preventable vision loss and improve eye care in rural Myanmar. MECP is led by Dr. Geoff Cohn, a Sydney-based ophthalmologist. Eight times per year, Dr. Cohn leads a team of over 40 Australian ophthalmologists, technicians, and support staff to the hospital to treat eye diseases such as cataracts and glaucoma. The foundation also provides ophthalmic surgical equipment to the hospital and trains local specialists to perform eye care procedures in the absence of the Australian team. MECP has performed over 12,000 surgeries and currently performs 5,000 per year throughout Myanmar. In 2014, at Wachet Hospital alone, MECP treated 1,500 patients. It has also provided services to four other monastery-based eye care centers and one non-monastery-based clinic in Myanmar. =Brighter Future Foundation= The Brighter Future Foundation (BFF) is a nonprofit organization founded by Zwe Nanda and Dr. Thinn Thinn Hlaing in 2005. It provides health services and equipment to public hospitals, helps educate health care professionals, and supports undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Myanmar. In July 2013, its doctors and volunteers provided free diabetes care to 270 patients at Wachet Hospital, offering each patient blood tests (to measure kidney function, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and blood sugar), urine tests, and a one-week supply of medication. In August 2014, the team made another visit. The foundation also gave the hospital an Afinion HbA1c analyzer, which measures glycated hemoglobin levels in blood. =Vipassana Hawai‚Äôi/MettaDana Project= Vipassana Hawai‚Äôi, based in Hawaii, promotes the teachings of Buddha as preserved in the PƒÅli Canon of Theravada Buddhism. In 1995, Steven Smith of Vipassana, in collaboration with Sayadaw U Lakkhana and the Kyaswa Monastery, started the MettaDana Project, which provides funding, staff support, medicines, and other supplies to Wachet Hospital. The group has arranged a public health training program on HIV/AIDS and funded additional training programs for the hospital‚Äôs technical and clerical workers. In addition, Vipassana helped establish the acupuncture training and treatment program at the hospital. The MettaDana Project collects charitable donations, which are then distributed to communities in Myanmar through the Kyaswa Monastery. In addition to its support for the hospital, it has provided educational grants to approximately 300 primary school students in Wachet, helped fund a new primary school in Wachet village, and assisted with humanitarian relief after Cyclone Nargis.

Most promotional materials, such as videos show barefoot ridershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=69&v;=pBL2iEbxlV4 Pete Hamborg, a Huntington Beach Fireman and father of five boys, created the first Hamboards as a garage hobby to allow his sons (and their friends) to surf the pavement on days that the actual surf was too big or too small. Years of tinkering and optimization led to the first Hamboards assembled in bulk. The design comprised bamboo or birch decks, fitted with commercially available branded trucks, wheels and bearings. For the next several years, Hamboards were assembled by friends and family from a small shop in Huntington Beach where they were also sold locally. This configuration worked reasonably well, at small scale, except for the nagging design flaw inherent in the trucks which were never designed for the enormous loads imparted by the huge and wide Hamboards decks. Years later, as the demands of running a small business became burdensome, Pete enlisted his east coast cousin Don Sandusky who was an experienced entrepreneur, engineer, inventor and sporting goods executive. An asset purchase agreement was executed between Pete and Hamboards Holdings, LLC. Within a year of forming the company, Hamboards was featured on Shark Tank on ABC, Season 5, Episode 4, which aired on October 12, 2013. Businessman Robert Herjavec offered $300K in exchange for a 30% stake in the company. The terms of the actual arrangement is bound by confidential terms. Notwithstanding, the television segment was popular and enjoyed multiple reruns, launching the brand around the world. The conversion from garage hobby to business was a challenging scale exercise. Hamboards started as a local specialty skateboard shop and rapidly transformed into an international direct to consumer online business , that produced several variations of the longboard and skateboard, including The Classic, Pinger, Logger, Fish, Huntington Hop, Pescadito, Biscuit and Street Sweeper street stand up paddles.

He has worked in France, the United States and India, and has completed many private and public commissions. Life Marcel Mayer was born in Grenoble. His family was of Spanish-Portuguese origin. His grandfather was a painter and decorator, and his mother was a painter as well as a musician and singer. Mayer studied at the Lycee Vaucanson engineers' college in Grenoble, but decided to become a sculptor. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Mayer was imprisoned in Germany and then in Rava-Ruska, Ukraine. After he returned to France, for seven years the city of Nice let him use a studio in the Villa Paradiso which had been used as a replacement for the Villa Medici in Rome during the war. He completed several commissions of memorials to the French Resistance. Mayer became a friend of Countess Marie de Saint Exupery, mother of the author Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry (1900‚Äì44), who commissioned him to make a bust of her son from photographs. He held his first exhibition in Paris with an introduction written by Albert Camus. Baroness Alix de Rothschild commissioned various works after seeing the exhibition. He also received a commission to sculpt a bust of the actress Romy Schneider. Mayer traveled to the US where he lived for several years, based in Taos, New Mexico. He taught, lectured and exhibited in one-man shows and group shows in New York, Dallas, Denver, Santa Fe and other cities. He returned to Europe, and continued to execute private and public commissions, as well as teaching. Work Mayer has worked in a wide range of media including granite, woodcuts, monotypes, oil paintings and watercolors. In the 1960s in Taos Mayer developed a new technique with printing ink, borrowing from engraving and calligraphy. In Province in 1976 he used this technique for a series of large works drawing on various different religious traditions. About 30 pieces have been made in this series. In 1974 he made a bust of Louis Armstrong for the Nice International Jazz Festival, which stands in the garden of Ar√®nes de Cimiez. In 1983 he made the stele of the Marshals of France for the city of Nice.

A high erodability implies that the same amount of work exerted by the erosion processes leads to a larger removal of material. Because the mechanics behind erosion depend upon the competence and coherence of the material, erodability is treated in different ways depending on the type of surface that eroded. Soils Soil erodibility is a lumped parameter that represents an integrated annual value of the soil profile reaction to the process of soil detachment and transport by raindrops and surface flow. The most commonly used model for predicting soil loss from water erosion is the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) (also known as the K-factor technique), which estimates the average annual soil loss A as: :A = R K L S C P where R is the rainfall erosivity factor, K is the soil erodibility,Soil Erodability (K-Factor) in Europe, European Commission. L and S are topographic factors representing length and slope, and C and P are cropping management factors. Other factors such as the stone content (referred as stoniness), which acts as protection against soil erosion, are very significant in Mediterranean countries. RocksShear stress model= Geological and experimental studies have shown that the erosion of bedrock by rivers follows in first approach the following expressionBagnold, R. A. (1977), Bedload transport by natural rivers, Water Resoure. Res., 13, 303‚Äì312, doi:10.1029/WR013i002p00303. known as the shear stress model of stream power erosion: :{dz \\\\over dt} = - K_\\\\tau (\\\\tau\\\\ - \\\\tau\\\\ _c) ^a where z is the riverbed elevation, t is time, K_\\\\tau is the erodability, \\\\tau is the basal shear stress of the water flow, and a is an exponent. For a river channel with a slope S and a water depth D, \\\\tau can be expressed as: :\\\\tau\\\\ = \\\\rho\\\\ g D S Note that K_\\\\tau embeds not only mechanical properties inherent to the rock but also other factors unaccounted in the previous two equations, such as the availability of river tools (pebbles being dragged by the current) that actually produce the abrasion of the riverbed. K_\\\\tau can be measured in the lab for weak rocks, but river erosion rates in natural geological scenarios are often slower than 0.1 mm/yr, and therefore the river incision must be dated over periods longer than a few thousand years to make accurate measurements. Ke values range between 10‚àí6 to 10+2 m yr‚àí1 Pa‚àí1.5 for a=1.5 and 10‚àí4 to 10+4 m yr‚àí1 Pa‚àí1 for a=1.Garcia-Castellanos, D., A. Villase√±or, 2011. Messinian salinity crisis regulated by competing tectonics and erosion at the Gibraltar Arc.

Location The house has two buildings (at N¬∞88 and N¬∞90). It is on the eastern side of Gda≈Ñska Street, between Zamoyskiego street and Chodkiewcza street. It stands close to remarkable tenements in the same street: * Villa Carl Grosse at N¬∞84; * Otto Riedl Tenement at N¬∞85; * Tenement at Gdanska street 91; * Hugo Hecht tenement at N¬∞92-94. History Both houses have been built in the years 1888-1889. They were part of a project of six close stylish buildings ordered by the merchant and dealer in timber Hugo Felix Franz Hecht. He assigned Bydgoszcz architect J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki to realize his scheme. The owner of the buildings between 1900 and 1939 was an activist and social worker in Bydgoszcz, physician Hermann Dietz. He had made in 1900 an residential wing added to the building, according to a design of the initial project manager, Joseph ≈öwiƒôcicki. At this time, the address of the villa was Danziger Stra√üe 123-124. Architecture The two juxtaposed buildings, covered with mansard roofs, seemingly create a uniform shape. However, the architect, through the use of different decorative motifs on each of the buildings, subtly contrasted them. Both villas represent a style modeled on the French Neo-Renaissance. This is reflected in the choice of details and in the structure of the edifice with a characteristic avant-corps, topped with a decorative gable, breaking the facade symmetry. Frontage is decorated with diverse architectural details.

She was an influential member of several organizations founded by LGBTI women of color, most notably: The Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press (with Audre Lorde, Cherrie Moraga and Hattie Gusset). Bain was also a renowned professor of Black Studies for the City University of New York for several decades (at Hunter College, John Jay College and New York Institute of Technology). The Myrna Bain Scholarship at John Jay College is dedicated to her memory. Myrna Bain scholarship fundraiser concert Bain was also influential as the teacher of many published feminist writers in the United States and internationally including Dorothea Smartt, Donna Aza-Weir Soley, Tracie Morris and Marianne Goodreax-Fielder. Bain was an active writer who associated with other luminaries such as Amiri Baraka, Quincy Troupe, Audre Lorde and most notably, James Baldwin. Personal life Bain was born in Florida and, along with many black families, moved north during the great African-American migration. Her family ultimately settled in the Bronx borough of New York City. Her parents divorced but were active in her upbringing. Bain had a sibling, Julian Bain (d. 2007). Myrna's early years were spent in one of the numerous wood frame homes owned by working class African Americans. Upon the initiation of the Robert Moses public works project, Myrna's home was razed and her family relocated to a Bronx based housing project. This event would color Bain's work throughout her career.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qNMQAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=CYwDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6553%2C682360 Bain was an initiated priestess in the Afro-Cuban religion known as Lukum√≠ or Santer√≠a and presided as initiatory godmother or \\"iyalorisha\\" to many practitioners. Bain's tutelary orisha was Aganju and she was initiated in a process known as \\"Shango oro Aganju\\" and given the orisha name \\"Ilari Oba.\\" Political life Bain was a lifelong participant in the political process both as a writer and direct participant. Starting out in the 1960s, Bain was active in the black power movement at points being connected to the Black Panther Party and the Freedom Summer movement. The most mainstream political period for Bain involved a stint as a public relations operative for the Republican Party (Publicity Director for the Minorities Division of the Republican National Committee). Bain always maintained that she did this period of work to ‚Äúknow how the other side worked‚Äù. Upon having her fill of the bureaucratic process Bain would leave and carry on her political ideas within academia.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bqJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=u1wDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5257%2C4107818 References https://www.pbs.org/outofthepast/past/p6/1981_1.html http://thefeministwire.com/2014/02/the-forging-of-a-caribbean-feminist- consciousness-laying-claim-to-audre-lordes-legacy/‚Äîin article on Audre Lorde Category:2007 deaths Category:1939 births ","title":"Myrna Bain"},{"id":"45636950","text":"The following television stations in the United States brand as channel 21 (though neither using virtual channel 21 nor broadcasting on physical RF channel 21): 21 branded ","title":"Channel 21 branded TV stations in the United States"},{"id":"45636951","text":"Moelfre may refer to: * Moelfre, Anglesey, a village and community on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales, United Kingdom * Moelfre, Conwy, a place in the county borough of Conwy, Wales, United Kingdom * Moelfre, Gwynedd, a hill in the Snowdonia range, in the county of Gwynedd, Wales, United Kingdom * Moelfre, Powys, a hamlet in the community of Llansilin in the county of Powys, Wales, United Kingdom * Moelfre island ","title":"Moelfre"},{"id":"45636958","text":"Yvonna Sessions Lincoln (born May 25, 1944) is an American methodologist and higher education scholar. Currently a Distinguished Professor of Higher Education and Human Resource Development at Texas A&M; University in College Station, Texas, Lincoln holds the Ruth Harrington Endowed Chair of Educational Leadership. As an author, she has been largely collected by libraries. Lincoln is best known in social science research for her contribution to qualitative methodology. With her late husband, Egon Guba (March 1, 1924 - March 26, 2008), Lincoln wrote Naturalistic Inquiry in 1985. The book offers a critique of positivism and suggests the ontology, epistemology, axiology, methodology, and methods that comprise a \\"naturalistic\\" paradigm for inquiry. Since its publication in 1985, Naturalistic Inquiry has been translated into 8 languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. Early life Lincoln was born Yvonna Sessions in Tampa, Florida. One of five children born to Edgar Eugene Sessions, Sr. (a welder for Atlantic Coastline Railroad) and Mary Bond Brown Sessions (an insurance rater for Metropolitan Life Insurance), Lincoln was the eldest daughter. Lincoln graduated from Hillsborough High School in Hillsborough County, Florida in 1962 and attended Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan for undergraduate studies. At Michigan State she majored in history and sociology earning her A.B. in 1967. Lincoln earned an M.A. in Medieval and East European History from University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana in 1970 and a doctorate in higher education, organizational theory, and program evaluation at Indiana University (1987) While studying at Indiana University, Lincoln met and later married Egon Guba. It was this professional and personal relationship that gave birth to Naturalistic Inquiry, which \\"began the earthquake-like revolution in educational research which resulted in the growth of qualitative research methods in education.\\" Naturalistic Inquiry In their preface, Lincoln and Guba explain that \\"We [researchers, scientists, and laypersons] are all so imbued with the tenets of science that we take its assumptions utterly for granted, so much so that we almost cannot comprehend the possibility that there might be other ways of thinking. And when other ways are suggested, we are inclined to shut our ears, feeling that merely to listen to them is, quite literally, a heresy.\\" Provocatively, Lincoln and Guba then \\"[propose] such a heresy.\\" The goal of Naturalistic Inquiry was not to introduce previously unconsidered ideas as much as it was to aggregate, streamline, and sell a \\"palatable\\" and \\"reasonable\\" alternative to traditional positivist research. In Naturalistic Inquiry, Lincoln and Guba \\"[contrast] postpositivist and naturalist paradigms on philosophical and methodological dimensions.\\" The major naturalist axioms include: * Realities are multiple, socially- constructed, and holistic (ontology). * Knower and known are interactive, inseparable (epistemology). * Only time- and context-bound working hypotheses are possible (generalizability). * All entities are in a state of mutual simultaneous shaping, so that it is impossible to distinguish causes from effects (causality). * Inquiry is value-bound (axiology). Additionally, Naturalistic Inquiry offers instructions to researchers wishing to engage in its paradigm. Chapters are devoted to \\"Designing a Naturalistic Inquiry,\\" \\"Implementing the Naturalistic Inquiry,\\" \\"Establishing Trustworthiness,\\" \\"Processing Naturalistically Obtained Data,\\" and \\"Case Reporting,Member Checking, and Auditing.\\" =Criticism= Early criticism of Naturalistic Inquiry resulted from perceived inconsistencies in the subjective nature of the paradigm and the objective evaluation strategies of trustworthiness. Holt (1991) argues that while Lincoln and Guba \\"advocate that the field researcher follow certain techniques that increase the trustworthiness of the research (dimensionalized as credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability)...the trustworthiness criterion and associated techniques proposed by Lincoln and Guba and Wallendorf and Belk contradict the nature of the interpretive task, and furthermore, pose insurmountable problems in application.\\" Perhaps anticipating this response, Lincoln and Guba (1986) published \\"But is it rigorous?: Trustworthiness and authenticity in naturalistic evaluation.\\" This article proposes that the trustworthiness criteria are principally methodological criteria, deriving largely from anthropology and sociology. On the other hand, the authenticity criteria are derived solely as outgrowths of the metaphysical assumptions of naturalistic/constructivist inquiry, and are considerably more interpretive and community-driven. Further, the tendency of the latter criteria is toward social justice and participant utility. Later criticism of Naturalistic Inquiry has revolved around presumed orthodoxy in the paradigm that binds post-modern approaches to collection and analysis of qualitative data. Professional Lincoln has served on the faculty of three institutions of higher education including Texas A&M; University, Vanderbilt University, and University of Kansas. While at these universities, she has been a Department Head (Texas A&M; University), Program Director (Texas A&M; University and University of Kansas), University Distinguished Professor (Texas A&M; University), Professor (Texas A&M; University), Associate Professor (Vanderbilt University and University of Kansas), and Assistant Professor (University of Kansas). She has served as the President of the Association for the Study of Higher Education (1997-1998), the Division J Vice-President of the American Educational Research Association (1990-1992), and the president of the American Evaluation Association (1989-1990). Some of her many awards include: * Presidential Citation, American Educational Research Association (2013) * Lifetime Achievement Award, International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry (2010) * Association of Former Students' University Distinguished Research Award (2009) * Howard R. Bowen Career Achievement Award, Association for the Study of Higher Education (2004) * Indiana University College of Education Distinguished Alumna Award (2002) * Ruth Harrington Chair of Educational Leadership University Distinguished Professor of Higher Education (2001) * Distinguished Achievement Award for Research, Association of Former Students, Texas A&M; University, Spring. (1997) * Research Achievement Award, Association for the Study of Higher Education. (1993) * Sidney Suslow Distinguished Research Award, Association for Institutional Research. (1991) Recent work Along with Norman K. Denzin (University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana), Lincoln has published four editions of the Handbook of Qualitative Research. The fifth edition is currently in progress. The Handbook, as it's known, is considered a touchstone for qualitative scholars, putting some of the greatest methodology minds in conversation with one another. Lincoln's most recent work, The Constructivist Credo (2013), won the 2014 American Educational Research Association Qualitative Research Special Interest Group Book Award. The book (co-authored with her late husband Egon Guba) is a \\"set of foundational principles for those wishing to conduct social science research within the constructivist paradigm.\\" Her current scholarship explores the ways in which neoliberalism and academic capitalism affect faculty work-life.

In 1927, the brothers Francesco and Eugenio Cassani designed and built the Cassani 40CV agricultural tractor. This was powered by a Diesel engine, a form of propulsion that had begun to be used in industrial, military and rail vehicle applications since the 1920s. The engine was a two stroke horizontal two-cylinder unit with a capacity of 12,723 cm3 producing forty horsepower at 550 rpm, with wick ignition, a compressed air starter system with pressurised air tank air, 4 speeds (3 FWD and 1 REV) and a top speed of 15 km/h.http://www.archiviostoricosamedeutz- fahr.com/en/museum/tractors/cassani-40-cv/ The Cassani 40 CV at the Same History Museum This tractor was sold at a price of 28,000 Lire. The tractor designed by Cassani was sold under license by Officine Gaetano Barbieri in Castelmaggiore. Established in 1942, the newly formed company SAME initially manufactured petrol and diesel engines for civil and industrial applications such as winches, cranes, ploughs and fire-fighting pumps. In 1946, SAME introduced its first motor mower models, powered by an 8 HP petrol engine. = From post-WWII to the Italian economic boom = At the Milan Trade Fair in 1946, SAME presented its first 3-wheeled petrol-powered motor mower, which could also be attached to other agricultural machinery and implements. This was the company's first ‚Äúuniversal tractor‚Äù, catering for the needs of the market in the years immediately following the Second World War. The SAME 3R/10, a universal small tractor powered by a single cylinder 10 HP petrol engine, was presented in 1948. This machine had two driving wheels and a single steering wheel, variable track and reversible drive. The tractor was awarded the gold medal by the Turin Agricultural Academy. On 24 October 1948, the ‚ÄúGiornale dell‚ÄôAgricoltura‚Äù described it as ‚Äúa gem of Italian industry‚Äù.http://www.archiviostoricosamedeutz-fahr.com/en/museum/brands/same/ History of the SAME brand SAME Explorer Production of the brand's petrol powered models began in 1950, with the introduction of the 10 HP SAME 4R/10 and the 20 HP 4R/20. 1952 saw the launch of the DA 25, the first mass-produced modern tractor with all-wheel drive, powered by a 25 HP, 2280 cm3 two cylinder diesel engine, with a 7 speed transmission and a top speed of 24.3 km/h. The name DA stood for Diesel Aria (Diesel Air), as the engine was air-cooled, in keeping with SAME traditions. Mass production of four-wheel drive tractors, with original dual traction system, already conceived in 1928, begins. The new DA 30 DT was launched in 1957. Offered as 8 variants, this model was the replacement for the DA 25. During this period, SAME also introduced and manufactured a range of specific implements such as ploughs (single blade, double blade, disc and reversible ploughs), spring tine cultivators, disc harrows, rototillers, backhoes, cutter bars, tipper trailers, irrigation pumps and auger drills. The first DA 30 DT models were painted orange with green wheels, while towards the end of the 1950s. The colour scheme was changed to red for the bodywork and wheels and dark grey for the engine. The SAME 240 was launched in 1958. This was known as the 'intelligent tractor', as it was equipped as standard with the innovative S.A.C. ('Stazione Automatica di Controllo' - 'Automatic Control Station') lower hitch arm draft control system conceived by SAME, which would be implemented across the entire range over the following years. This tractor was powered by a 42 HP two cylinder unit, with 6 forward speeds, one reverse speed and a top speed of 28.9 km/h. Front view of the SAME 240 tractor model from 1959 = From the Italian economic boom to the late 1970s = 1961 was the year of the SAME Puledro and the Samecar, a tractor which, after working the land, could then also be used to transport produce in its load bay. A new range of 6 and 8 cylinder engines was also developed during this period. At the Verona expo in 1965, SAME presented its new V engines and the Italia V, Atlanta, Sametto V and 450 V tractors. Another major development was the change from traditional rounded cowls to a more modern, boxy design. The Centauro range, consisting of three different models, was launched in 1965. These tractors were powered by a 3500 cm3 V4 engine producing 55 HP, with 8 forward speeds, 4 reverse speeds and a top speed of 34.8 km/h. The 1972 Corsaro 70 and Saturno 80 tractors were presented in 1972. In 1973, SAME bought Lamborghini Trattori S.p.A. from Ferruccio Lamborghini, in its own range. In 1979, SAME acquired the Swiss H√ºrlimann Traktoren brand and changed its name to Gruppo SLH (SAME+Lamborghini+H√ºrlimann), becoming the second largest tractor producer in Italy and a leading manufacturer on a global scale. Tractors exhibited in the SAME History Museum = From the 1980s to the end of the 20th century = The SAME Explorer family, which was to become one of the most successful product ranges in the history of the company, was launched in 1983. This was the first Italian-built tractor with a top speed of 40 km/h, and the only tractor with 4-wheel braking. The technology offered by Gruppo SLH at the end of the 1980s also included the original Twin Vision video camera rear view system. SAME engine technology also took a major step forward, with electronically controlled fuel injection available for the entire 1000 Series. In 1991, the Electronic PowerShift transmission, designed specifically for high power applications, was launched together with the Titan range, while the Frutteto II introduced a family of tractors dedicated for use in fruit orchards and vineyards. In 1995, Gruppo SLH acquired the agricultural machinery division of Kl√∂ckner-Humboldt-Deutz, giving rise to the SAME Deutz-Fahr group. = The 21st century = In 1999, SAME introduced the Galileo self-levelling system in the Rubin 200 tractor range. This system, developed to facilitate working on gradients, won the Golden Tractor for design Millennium Edition award in 2000. 2007 marked the 80th anniversary of the first tractor built by Francesco and Eugenio - the Cassani 40CV. On 12 October 2012, SAME celebrated its 70th birthday at its historical headquarters in Treviglio. To mark the occasion, the Italian brand announced a spate of new investments and new models for the future, chief among which the \\"Virtus\\" (100-110-120-130 HP) tractor family, designed by Italdesign Giugiaro.

It is a fixed-dose combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir. Specifically it is used together with dasabuvir or ribavirin for cases caused by hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 4. Cure rates are around 95%. It is taken by mouth. It is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include nausea, itchiness, rash, and trouble sleeping. Other side effects include allergic reactions and reactivation of hepatitis B among those previously infected. Use is not recommended in those with significant liver problems. While there is no evidence of harm with use during pregnancy, this use has not been well studied. Each of the medications works by a different mechanism. The ritonavir is present to decrease the breakdown of paritaprevir. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2014, and without dasabuvir in 2015. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is used together with dasabuvir or ribavirin for cases caused by hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 4. Cure rates are around 95%.  Contraindications  *People with moderate to severe liver impairment *Concurrent use of moderate to strong inducers of CYP3A and strong inducers of CYP2C8 reduce efficacy  Side effects  Post-market surveillance reports show hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure associated with Viekira Pak use. It is likely that most patients who experienced this had advanced cirrhosis prior to treatment initiation. Hepatic decompensation is described by rising bilirubin without ALT elevations alongside clinical symptoms such as ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic decompensation and bilirubin levels should be tested in the first four weeks of treatment and compared to baseline. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir could cause hepatitis B re-activation in people co-infected with hepatitis B and C viruses. The European Medicines Agency recommended screening all people for hepatitis B before starting ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for hepatitis C in order to minimize the risk of hepatitis B reactivation. Society and culture It is manufactured by Abbvie. In the United States ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir together with dasabuvir is sold as Viekira Pak.Viekira Pak on Drugs.com. Technivie consists of only ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets. Technivie was discontinued in the US market in 2020. =Approval=United States Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir together with dasabuvir was approved in its first review cycle by the FDA in December 2014. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) designated the product for Fast Track because it had potential to treat unmet medical need. This track allows the CDER to view certain information ahead of a completed NDA to cut down the time to approval. Additionally, it was designated Breakthrough Therapy for its substantial improvement in the primary endpoint SVR12 and given Priority Review under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act allowing the review to be completed in six months rather than the standard ten months. Europe In Europe, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is approved under the trade name Viekirax for combination therapy together with dasabuvir, with or without ribavirin.

Pearl IV had a 97% cure rate. = Turquoise II = Turquoise II was an open-label, randomized trial which had a primary endpoint of cure (SVR12) rate in patients with compensated cirrhosis and either HCV GT1a or GT1b and both treatment arms were given Viekira Pak and (RBV). The two treatment arms differed by length of treatment: subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment for either 12 or 24 weeks. The results were stratified based on whether or not subjects had previously received pegIFN/RBV treatment. This is the only phase III trial which has been completed with Viekira Pak and cirrhotic patients with HCV. TURQUOISE II reported a 95% cure rate for the 24-week arm and 99% cure rate for the 12-week arm. Subjects with genotype 1a had higher cure rates in the 24-week arm than the 12-week arm.

He worked as an apprentice in the shipyard of Mathew Van Duzen, the Byerly and Van Dusen Shipyard in Philadelphia. Shipbuilding in California At the age of 22, Domingo Marcucci came to start a shipyard in San Francisco from Philadelphia. He came from Panama in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company steamship SS Oregon. Arriving on September 18, 1849, within days they began assembling a knock-down steamboat, previously delivered, on the beach of Yerba Buena Cove at Happy Valley, at the foot of Folsom Street, east of Beale Street. Marcucci's company assembled the Captain Sutter in six weeks. Built for George W. Aspinwall, brother of William Henry Aspinwall, it was the first steamboat that ran between San Francisco and Stockton, in 1849. Nancy J. Olmsted, Vanished Waters: A History of San Francisco's Mission Bay\\", Mission Creek Conservancy, 1986, Chapter 7, Steamboat Point, 1851-1864 from foundsf.org accessed February 19, 2015 Also for the Pacific Mail, Marcucci next converted the 153 ton side- wheel steamboat El Dorado that had been rigged as a 3 masted schooner for the trip around Cape Horn, to be used for the Sacramento run. Subsequently, in March 1850, for the same company, he assembled the Georgiana, a small 30 ton side-wheel steamboat made in Philadelphia, knocked down and sent by sea also for the Sacramento run. That April Georgiana pioneered the shortcut route between Sacramento and Stockton through a slough in the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta that was between the Sacramento River and Mokelumne River, which afterward became known as Georgiana Slough. In the 1858, Marcucci moved to a shipyard at Steamboat Point, around Fourth and King Streets on Mission Bay. Here he built the side-wheel steamboat Flora Templeton in 1859, the barkentine Monitor in 1861, the side-wheel steamer Cyrus Walker for the Puget Sound in 1864 and the propeller steamer Reliance for the Alviso Transportation Company in 1866. From 1866 to 1869, using Henry B. Tichenor‚Äôs Second Street marine railway, Marcucci built the stern-wheeler Pioneer, the twin screw propeller steamer Santa Cruz in 1868 and the large propeller steamer Vallejo for the California Pacific Railroad Company in 1869. Later life Marcucci was appointed assistant inspector of steam vessels for the port of San Francisco, by the Treasury Department, in December, 1890. On September 2, 1893, he was struck on the head by a falling timber while inspecting the railroad ferry Thoroughfare in Oakland, California. He survived a fractured skull, recovered and continued to work. He resigned the position in January 1900 and retired. Domingo Marcucci died in 1905, and was buried in the San Francisco Columbarium.

She was also enrolled at the University of Illinois, where she held a position in the Catalog Department of the university library. Career Savord began her career in approximately 1910, when she became an apprentice at the Sandusky Library. After her graduation from Case Western University, she worked in the Catalog Department of the Cleveland Public Library. During World War I, she relocated to New York City and worked for the Western Union Telegraph Company; after the war, she was employed by the Newark Public Library.The Sandusky Register, March 27, 1932, p. 5. Savord assisted Helen Clay Frick in organizing the Frick Art Reference Library, an institution dedicated to serving the art and art history research community, which Miss Frick had founded in 1920 as a memorial to her father, the collector Henry Clay Frick.

It is present in many Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative species, and archaea of the phylum euryarchaeota. Cyclic di-AMP crystal structure It is one of many ubiquitous nucleotide second messengers including cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp), and cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP). c-di-AMP is a signaling nucleotide used in signaling pathways that trigger outputs by using receptor or target proteins to sense c-di-AMP concentrations in the cell. In bacteria, cyclic di-AMP has been implicated in the control of growth, cell wall homeostasis, bacterial biofilm formation and virulence gene expression, heat and osmotic stress regulation and responses, sporulation, potassium transport, lysis, and antibiotic resistance. In humans, cyclic di-AMP has been implicated in the control of innate immune response and antiviral response against pathogens. The dinucleotide is also produced by numerous human pathogens, prompting the exploration of numerous c-di-AMP-regulating pathways both in humans and in bacteria. Cyclic di-AMP 2D structure  Synthesis  Cyclic di-AMP is synthesized by a membrane-bound diadenylate cyclase (also called diadenylyl cyclase, CdA, and DAC) enzyme called CdaA (DacA). DacA condenses two ATP molecules to make c-di-AMP, releasing 2 pyrophosphates in the process. DacA requires a manganese or cobalt metal ion cofactor. Most bacteria possess only one DAC enzyme, but some bacteria like B. subtilis possess two additional DAC enzymes (DisA and CdaS). Cyclic di-AMP synthesis is inhibited by the GImM I154F mutation in the lactococcus lactis bacterium. GImM is the phosphoglucosamine mutase enzyme that interconverts glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate to later form cell wall peptidoglycan and other polymers. The I154F mutation inhibits CdA activity by binding to it more strongly than wild-type GImM binds. Thus, GImM modulates c-di-AMP levels. Synthesis is regulated a number of ways, including negative feedback inhibition and upregulation through a decrease in phosphodiesterase. c-di-AMP synthesis and degradation reaction  Degradation  Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes degrade cyclic di-AMP to the linear molecule 5‚Äô-pApA (phosphadenylyl adenosine). pApA is also involved in a feedback inhibition loop that limits GdpP gene-dependent c-di-AMP hydrolysis, leading to elevated c-di-AMP levels.  Regulation  Since cyclic di-AMP is a signaling nucleotide, it is presumed to adhere to the same regulation pathways, where environmental changes are sensed by synthesis or degradation enzymes, which modulate enzyme concentration. Regulation of c-di-AMP is critical because high c-di-AMP levels lead to abnormal physiology, growth defects, and reduced virulence in infection. In some bacteria, loss of the phosphodiesterases that degrade c-di-AMP leads to cell death. It is possible that in addition to enzymatic regulation, intracellular c-di-AMP levels can be regulated by active transport via multidrug resistance transporters that secrete c-di-AMP from the cytoplasm. Listeria monocytogenes has demonstrated such an effect. At high concentrations, cyclic di-AMP binds to receptor and target proteins to control specific pathways. Elevated c-di-AMP levels have also been linked to increased resistance toward cell wall-damaging antibiotics (e.g. Œ≤-lactams) and reduced cellular turgor. = Fatty acid synthesis = Cyclic di-AMP has been linked to fatty acid synthesis regulation in Myobacterium smegmatis, the growth of S. aureus in conditions of low potassium, the sensing of DNA integrity in B. subtilis, and cell wall homeostasis in multiple species. Cell wall precursor, and thus peptidoglycan precursor, biosynthesis activity can also affect c-di-AMP levels in the cell. Similarly, c-di-AMP levels affect peptidoglycan precursor synthesis, suggesting a strong link between the c-di-AMP and peptidoglycan synthetic pathways. = Cell lysis and RNA synthesis = It is suggested that cyclic di- AMP is involved in the regulation of cell lysis. Studies have shown that bacterial mutant strains with low c-di-AMP levels lysed significantly faster than their parent strains. Cyclic di-AMP has also been linked to bacterial RNA synthesis inhibition. c-di-AMP stimulates the production of (p)ppGpp, an alarmone involved in bacterial stringent response. = STING pathway = In eukaryotic cells, c-di-AMP is sensed and subsequently elicits a type I interferon (IFN) response, leading to the activation of defense mechanisms against viral infection. This detection and activation pathway involves STING, TBK1, and IRF3. c-di-AMP may also stimulate dendritic cells, leading to T cell activation. c-di-AMP activates the innate immune pathway STING (stimulator of interferon genes) to detect damaged DNA. The nucleotide either binds to the helicase DDX41, which in turn activates the STING pathway, or directly binds to the STING protein. Cyclic di-AMP has been identified (along with 2‚Äô3‚Äô-cGAMP) as a ligand that induces closing of the STING dimer, leading to STING polymerization and pathway activation. When a type I IFN response is not induced in response to c-di-AMP, STING is unable to relocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm for pathway activation, suggesting that c-di-AMP is a predominant ligand in STING polymerization, and thus activation, via intracellular translocation.

Publication The novel, which was the author's first, was rejected by √©ditions Gallimard but accepted and published by Jos√© Corti, which was associated with the surrealists. It was praised by the surrealist leader Andr√© Breton. An English translation by Louise Var√®se was published in 1951.

Location  The building stands on the eastern side of Gda≈Ñska Street between ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska street and Chocimska street. It stands close to remarkable tenements in the same street: * Villa Carl Grosse at N¬∞84; * Otto Riedl Tenement at N¬∞ 85; * Villa Hugo Hecht at N¬∞88-90; * Tenement at Gdanska street 91; * Hugo Hecht tenement at N¬∞92-94. History The house was built in 1895-1896, on a design by architect Joseph ≈öwiƒôcicki for a master stonecutter Carl Bradtke. Carl Bradtke worked also with Fritz Weidner for the erection of nearby building at N¬∞91. The house, from the beginning, had been thought as a rental building as well as a trading one with two wings merging at the rear. The initials of the first owner (\\"CB\\") appear in a cartouche of an upper pediment. The initial address of the house was Danzigerstrasse 53. At the beginning of the 20th century, the tenement housed a bicycles dealer, company Patria, run by Erich Krahn, . In the 1920s a patisserie () owned by Emil Kobielski had been operating in the building. Features The building has a richly decorated facade with two small side gables, in which stands a gargoyle on a background of ostrich feathers. The architect created a functional complex of buildings centered around a rectangular courtyard enclosed at the back. A hallway allows to get the residential house located at the back of the garden. The front building follows the Historicism style with references to Neo-Baroque and Rococo. In the same area, J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki also realized other edifices: * Hotel \\"Pod Orlem\\" at Gda≈Ñska street 14; * Oskar Ewald Tenement at Gda≈Ñska street 30; * J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki tenement at Gda≈Ñska street 63; * Tenement at Gda≈Ñska street 86; * Hugo Hecht tenement at Gda≈Ñska street N¬∞92-94; * Tenement at Plac Wolno≈õci 1.

The organization describes itself as \\"dedicated to strengthening liberty and justice in America\\" and supports conservative appointments to American judicial posts. Background The organization was founded in 2005 to promote the judicial appointees of then president George W. Bush. Fundraiser and lawyer Ann Corkery, along with California real estate magnate Robin Arkley II, were key to the beginning of the organization. The current leader is Carrie Severino. She was previously a law clerk to United States Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and to Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. She is a contributor to National Review. She is married to Roger Severino. Severino received her J.D. degree from Harvard Law School, where she was a student while Elena Kagan was dean. Severino has been involved with constitutional challenges to the Affordable Care Act. Funding The leading funder of JCN is the Wellspring Committee, which is directed by Ann Corkery. Wellspring, which does not disclose who funds it, gave close to $7 million to JCN in 2014; between 2012 and 2015, it reported giving JCN more than $15 million. JCN's tax return for the period July 2015 to June 2016 shows that one $17.9 million donation, whose source was not reported, accounted for 96.6 percent of the organization's revenue. Advocacy activities In 2013, JCN ran ads in Alaska that were critical of U.S. senator Mark Begich's votes to approve all of president Barack Obama's federal judicial nominees. The group also ran advertisements that were critical of Mary Landrieu and Mark Pryor's votes for president Obama's court picks. In 2014, the group ran digital advertisements critical of Chris Christie's judicial appointments. JCN has been active in Michigan and North Carolina supreme court elections. In 2015, the Judicial Crisis Network donated $600,000 to Nebraskans for the Death Penalty, a group promoting reinstatement of capital punishment in Nebraska. In 2016, the JCN ran a negative advertisement about Jane L. Kelly, a federal appeals judge from Iowa who was on a White House list of possible nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court. Also in 2016, the JCN bought advertisements across the country to oppose president Obama's supreme court nominee, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Merrick Garland. In November 2016, after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, JCN ran television advertisements praising senate judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley for holding the line against Garland. The group also spent over $500,000 on advertisements thanking Trump for his campaign promises regarding the types of justices he would select for the nation's high court. JCN's advertisements asked viewers to thank Trump for pledging to nominate conservative jurists in the mold of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court. On January 31, 2017, the Judicial Crisis Network committed to spending $10 million on advocacy ads in favor of president Donald Trump's first Supreme Court of the United States nominee, Neil Gorsuch. The Judicial Crisis Network spent $4.5 million in ad buys supportive of the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2019, the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability accused JCN of sending illegal robotexts to Indiana residents about the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/464887-watchdog- accuses-pro-kavanaugh-group-of-illegal-robotexts-in-fcc In September 2020, after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, JCN launched a $2.2 million campaign to support President Trump's right to appoint a judge prior to the November 2020 presidential election. The Judicial Education Project is closely aligned with the JCN.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. History and architecture The grave of Lev Lvovich Tolstoy in the church cemetery Sirek√∂pinge Church is one of the oldest in the province of Scania. Its oldest parts, the apse and choir, were built during the later part of the 12th century, by the Order of Saint John and dedicated to the Order's patron saint. The nave was rebuilt during the 15th century into its present shape. During the same century, the original wooden ceiling was also replaced with the current, star-shaped vaults. The lower parts of the tower were furthermore added during the 15th century, but proved too weak to support a tower. A wooden spire was instead built on the tower at a later point, and only during a renovation of the church in 1915‚Äì17 was the tower raised to its current height. The sacristy of the church was also built during the same time, and serves as a support for the northern wall of the choir. The church was renovated again in 1991. The building material of the church is mainly grey sandstone, used exclusively in the choir and apse. In the nave, blocks of sandstone have been mixed with blocks of granite. The church exterior is whitewashed, and the tower and other gables decorated with crow-stepped gables. Internally, the church is decorated with fragmentary Romanesque murals, as well as more well-preserved murals dating from the 14th century. The murals, which depict saints, the four evangelists and the devil, are located mainly in the choir. They were restored during the 1991 renovation. Among the furnishings, a decorated iron chandelier dates from the 14th century; it is one of only four chandelier of its kind in Sweden. The chandelier was exhibited at the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris as well as at the Baltic Exhibition of 1914 in Malm√∂. The crucifix of the church is a copy of the original (13th century) which is now in the Lund University Historical Museum in Lund. In the church cemetery lies the grave of Lev Lvovich Tolstoy, the son of Russian writer Leo Tolstoy.

She is the author of The Whole Pantry mobile app and its later companion cookbook. Throughout her career as a wellness guru, Gibson claimed she had a diagnosis involving multiple cancer pathologies throughout her internal organs; claimed she had forgone modern science-based medical treatments; claimed she was effectively self-managing her multiple cancers through diet, exercise, and alternative therapies; and claimed to have donated significant proportions of her income and her company's profits to numerous charities. In March 2015, after reports identified Gibson's fraudulent claims regarding her charitable donations, media investigation revealed that she had also fabricated her stories of cancer, and lied about her age, personal life and history. Concerns were expressed that Gibson had led a profligate lifestyle, renting an upmarket town house, leasing a luxury car and office space, undergoing cosmetic dental procedures, purchasing designer clothes and holidaying internationally, on money claimed to have been raised for charity. With a collapsing social media support base, Gibson admitted in an April 2015 interview that her claims of having multiple cancers had been fabricated, stating that \\"none of it's true\\". Gibson's actions were described as \\"particularly predatory\\" and \\"deceit on a grand scale, for personal profit\\". On May 6, 2016, Consumer Affairs Victoria announced legal action against Gibson and Inkerman Road Nominees Pty Ltd (originally known as Belle Gibson Pty Ltd) for \\"false claims by Ms. Gibson and her company concerning her diagnosis with terminal brain cancer, her rejection of conventional cancer treatments in favour of natural remedies, and the donation of proceeds to various charities.\\" On 15 March 2017, the Federal Court supported most of those claims, concluding that, \\"Ms. Gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer.\\" Biography Gibson was born in Launceston, Tasmania. According to interviews she has given, she left her Brisbane family home at age 12 to live with a classmate, and later lived with a family friend. Gibson attended Wynnum State High School in Manly, Queensland, until dropping out in Year 10, although she also later claimed to have been homeschooled. She worked for some time as a trainee for catering supply company PFD Food Services in Lytton, but social media reflected that by late 2008 she had relocated to Perth, Western Australia. There, she was involved in the skateboarding culture and actively participated in its online community. Gibson subsequently moved from Perth to Melbourne in July 2009 and became a mother one year later, at age 18. Gibson launched The Whole Pantry mobile app in August 2013, at age 21. Gibson reportedly told a prospective business partner in 2014 that she had \\"several names\\" that she went under, and in her most recent interview with The Australian Women's Weekly claimed \\"her mother changed her name five times\\". Gibson's corporate filings indicate that she is three years younger than she publicly claims to be. =The Whole Pantry= After Gibson launched The Whole Pantry app, it was reportedly downloaded 200,000 times within its first month. It was voted Apple's Best Food and Drink App of 2013. Gibson soon after signed a book deal with Lantern Books, an imprint of Penguin Books, for an accompanying table top cookbook, which was published in October 2014. She further worked with Apple Inc. in September 2014 to transition the app as a privileged pre-installed default third party inclusion in the Apple Watch's April 2015 launch. By early 2015, it was estimated that in excess of $1 million had been made in sales of The Whole Pantry app and book. Gibson chronicled her battle with cancer on a blog of the same name, but \\"doubts about her claims surfaced after she failed to deliver a promised $300,000 donation to a charity\\". Before doubts were raised about her health and charitable donation claims, Gibson had intended to expand her brand beyond the app, having earlier registered the domain The Whole Life, and advertised in December 2014 to recruit an IT specialist to expand the app and brand portfolio. Both The Whole Pantry app and The Whole Life were registered by Gibson's partner, Clive Rothwell, in her corporate name. The Whole Pantry registrar was amended in March 2015 after the controversy broke. While The Whole Pantry has unequivocally denied that Gibson ever helped anyone to reject conventional cancer treatment, Gibson has been quoted from her social media posts as claiming that she had \\"countless times helped others\\" to forgo conventional medical treatment for cancer and to treat themselves \\"naturally\\", as well as \\"leading them down natural therapy for everything from fertility, depression, bone damage and other types of cancer\\". =Health claims= In interviews, Gibson claimed to have suffered from malignant brain, blood, spleen, uterine, liver, and kidney cancers, which she attributed to a reaction to the Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine. When the book was launched in November 2014, Gibson claimed in its preface that she had been \\"stable for two years now with no growth of the cancer\\", but her story soon emerged as inconsistent: she also told media outlets that the cancer had reached her liver and kidneys, and three months earlier had posted on The Whole Pantry's Facebook page that her cancer had spread to her brain, blood, spleen, and uterus. She previously claimed that she had undergone heart surgery several times and to have momentarily died on the operating table. Gibson also claimed to have suffered a stroke. However, she was unable to substantiate her medical claims nor name the doctors who diagnosed and treated her. She also did not bear any surgical scars from her heart operations. Gibson's and The Whole Pantry's statements regarding the benefits of exercise, healthy eating and a positive mindset were uncontroversial, being widely acknowledged as conducive to holistic well being. However, on her now-deleted Instagram account and in other social media, Gibson also promoted more controversial or potentially dangerous alternative medical practices, including Gerson therapy, anti- vaccination, and the consumption of non-pasteurised raw milk. The highly controversial Gerson therapy had been similarly promoted by another Australian wellness blogger, Jessica Ainscough, whose funeral Gibson attended when Ainscough succumbed to cancer in late February 2015. With approximately 97% of the Australian population under seven years of age immunised, Federal vaccination policy heavily penalises parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, by denying access to significant welfare and other benefits, worth approximately $11,700 per annum. The sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Australia and, in Victoria, one three-year-old died and another four children under the age of five became seriously ill after consuming non- pasteurised milk in 2014. =Charitable claims= As Gibson's medical claims were being scrutinised, allegations emerged that charitable contributions raised in 2013 and 2014 had not been given to their intended causes. Gibson denied the charges, but Fairfax Media revealed that she had \\"failed to hand over proceeds solicited in the name of five charities\\" and had \\"grossly overstated the company's total donations to different causes\\". Two charities confirmed to The Australian newspaper that Gibson's company had used their names in fundraising drives but had either failed to deliver the donations or had inadequately accounted for the funds. Gibson had claimed on a number of occasions in 2014 that The Whole Pantry had donated approximately $300,000 to charities, including maternal healthcare in developing nations, medical support for children with cancer, and funding schools in sub-Saharan Africa. In late 2014, when The Whole Pantry app was pre-installed on the Apple iPad, Gibson claimed through her Instagram account to be working with twenty different charities. Gibson has long claimed in her LinkedIn professional networking profile, established in February 2013, to be a philanthropist. Gibson eventually admitted, in relation to fraud proceedings, that she had seriously overstated the level of charitable contributions that had been made. Subsequent media reports in March 2015 revealed that it could only be ascertained that an estimated $7,000 of the previously claimed $300,000 had been donated to a total of three charities, with at least $1,000 of the $7,000 reportedly having been donated only after Gibson became aware of the Fairfax investigation into her earlier claims. Another $1,000 of the $7,000 had been donated to a charitable cause under Rothwell's name, rather than Gibson's or the company name. Also in March 2015, the parents of a young child suffering from brain cancer, whom Gibson had befriended, came forward to report that they had been unaware that Gibson had earlier been claiming to be fundraising for their child's treatment on their behalf. The family had never received any funds from her or The Whole Pantry, and suspected Gibson had been using information gleaned from the family's experiences to underpin her own claims to having brain cancer. =Concern over publisher culpability= As the controversy grew, questions began to be raised about Apple, Penguin and the Australian media's lack of due diligence in prima facie accepting Gibson's claims to suffering multiple cancers, an issue taken up by the ABC's Media Watch program. Apple Inc., in response to media enquiry in March 2015, declined to remove The Whole Pantry app from sale, stating that it was only concerned about the functionality of the app. However, The Whole Pantry was soon thereafter removed from inclusion in the Apple Watch launch. Apple subsequently deleted the app from the Apple Store, and removed it from all Apple Watch promotional material. Apple has not provided any public comment regarding the reasons behind the removal of the app, but an internal email from an Australian executive to the company's US office acknowledged that the removal would be subject to comment. Lantern Books, when initially approached by investigative journalists, claimed it had not confirmed the validity of Gibson's cancer claims as it was not required for a cookbook. Soon after, as the controversy grew, Penguin withdrew the book from sale, citing a lack of response from Gibson to its queries relating to the media accusations. However, Fairfax reported that Penguin had, prior to publication of the book, already quizzed and videotaped Gibson on her cancer story, as recounted in the preface. Penguin agreed to pay A$30,000 to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund as a penalty for failing to validate the factual content of the book. Elle Australia magazine, published by Bauer Media Group, admitted that following a laudatory December 2014 story on Gibson, they had received but ultimately dismissed anonymous claims that she was fabricating her story. A second Bauer magazine, Cosmopolitan, which had awarded Gibson its 2014 \\"Fun Fearless Female\\" social media award, admitted that it too had received and dismissed a similar email. After Gibson's confessions, the magazine decided not to strip her of the award, stating that she had been \\"reader nominated and reader voted.\\" However, a month earlier, Cosmopolitans associate editor stated that they \\"put forward the nomination myself\\", indicating that the magazine not the public had been instrumental in promoting Gibson's award. A conventional cancer research professional from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research also went public to state that, by failing to conduct basic fact checking and providing \\"unfiltered PR\\" to Gibson's untested claims, an uncritical media had been complicit in her \\"scam\\". =Erasing the story= Once the controversy surfaced in the media, The Whole Pantry began removing any comments made on its (since deleted) Facebook page that questioned Gibson's claims, asserting that these comments only added to \\"the misinformation\\" of the initial Fairfax article. This selective deletion drew even more negative comment. Simultaneously, posts that Gibson had made on her Instagram account that made reference to her cancers or charitable donations were also selectively deleted. Soon after, all posts were deleted from Gibson's and The Whole Pantry's Instagram accounts. Around the same time, individual postings about Gibson's cancer, and claims of having died briefly while under heart surgery, were also being selectively deleted by the administrator of her blog \\"at the request of a user\\". Accounts across a number of social media platforms were soon either abandoned, made private, or deleted in their entirety. Gibson subsequently established another Facebook account under the alias Harry Gibson, which was made private and used to hit back at Facebook followers questioning her claims or speaking to the media. =Admission of deceit= In late April 2015, Gibson gave an interview to The Australian Women's Weekly, in which she admitted to having fabricated all her cancer claims. Gibson attributed her deceit to her upbringing, and specifically to neglect by her now-estranged mother, claiming to having been forced to take care of herself and her brother since the age of 5. The interview was, however, described as an admission of deceit, without expression of regret or apology. In a May 2015 interview with the same magazine, Gibson's mother Natalie Dal-Bello refuted several claims Gibson had made about her family, including the false claim that her brother was autistic. Gibson's Women's Weekly interview was arranged by Bespoke Approach, and Gibson was provided pro bono representation by the company during the interview. In June 2015, Gibson was rumoured to have received A$45,000 for an interview with Nine Network's 60 Minutes. Legal action Consumer Affairs Victoria brought legal action against Gibson for allegedly breaking Australian consumer law. The regulator said it had conducted an in-depth investigation of Gibson's activities and applied to Australia's Federal Court for leave to pursue legal action. Gibson's publisher, Penguin Australia, has already agreed to pay A$30,000 to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund as a penalty for releasing The Whole Pantry, which was not fact checked. On 15 March 2017, Federal Court Justice Debra Mortimer delivered the decision that \\"most but not all\\" of the claims against Gibson were proven. Gibson did not appear in court for the decision. Justice Mortimer found that Gibson's claims had been misleading and deceptive, and that \\"Ms. Gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer from the time she began making these claims in public to promote The Whole Pantry Book and the apps in mid-2013\\", but there was not enough evidence to prove that she was not acting out of delusion.. In September 2017, Gibson was fined A$410,000 for making false claims about her donations to charity.. , Gibson had not yet paid the fine, and authorities were seeking power to charge her with contempt of court. A new trial was set for 14 May and she faced an undetermined number of years in jail if she did not attend. As of mid-September 2019, Gibson still had not paid, claiming to be broke, and Consumer Affairs Victoria were still seeking to enforce the penalty. In a 2017 letter later released by the Federal Court, Gibson had stated that she was $170,000 in debt, and had $5,000 to her name. =House raid by police= On 22 January 2020, the Sheriff's Office of Victoria raided Gibson's home in Northcote and seized items to recoup Gibson's unpaid fines, which, due to interest and costs, exceeded half a million dollars. Claimed adoption into Oromo community On 23 January 2020, a Shabo Media video from October 2019 surfaced in which Gibson was wearing a headscarf and speaking partially in Oromo language (referring to herself as \\"Sanbotu\\"), discussing the political situation in Ethiopia with an interviewer and referring to Ethiopia as \\"back home\\". She professed to have been adopted by the Ethiopian community in Melbourne after volunteering for four years, calling the adoption a gift from \\"Allah\\". However, on the same day, the president of the Australian Oromo Community Association in Victoria, Tarekegn Chimdi, stated that Gibson was not a registered volunteer, \\"is not a community member and she‚Äôs also not working with the community,\\" and that he had only seen her at events two or three times. He expressed that nobody seemed to know who she was and he had only just learnt of her backstory, and expressed a desire for her to stop saying she is part of the community.

Under Lewis' guidance, Amazon studios went on to create the Parr Street Studios, which were designed and founded by Lewis. His work as a producer/re-mixer has included work for artists as diverse as China Crisis and Black Sabbath's fourteenth studio album, Headless Cross. Career In the early 1970s Jeremy bought the assets of recording studio, Liverpool Sound Enterprises literally the only recording studio in the Liverpool area at the time. After a change of name to Amazon Studios Lewis focused on using the studio for his own band initially with the hope of turning the studio into a commercial enterprise in the longer term. The studio in its early days used a unique 8-track tube multitrack and various upgrades were made to the studio by Lewis. Many local artists up to this point had used the studio facilities. At this point, few major studios were based outside London, so to begin with, Lewis' Amazon Studios rarely had notable artists recording there. In the early 1980s however, a surge of popular UK-based musicians from the North of England emerged. Many of these artists wanted to record closer to home and away from London. This led in a surge in popularity for northern recording studios, including Lewis' Amazon Studios. Over the next decade, Lewis produced many albums for notable British musicians and bands. Over 345 notable albums and singles were recorded at the studios, with Lewis playing an integral part in their production through the studios. One of his first notable works was with Pete Wylie's Wah! Heat and also China Crisis in the late 1970s. Much of this work was under the Indie label Lewis and Pete Fulwell founded, Inevitable. In 1984, the label released a compilation album, Small Hits and Near Misses. During this era, Lewis worked on production for the album, Difficult Shapes & Passive Rhythms, Some People Think It's Fun to Entertain for China Crisis. In 1989, Lewis worked on the production and finishing for Black Sabbath's fourteenth studio album, Headless Cross. During the 1980s and early 1990s as founder of Amazon Studios, Lewis oversaw a number of notable albums and singles that were recorded at the recording studios. This included albums such as This Is the Sea by The Waterboys, which included the single \\"The Whole of the Moon\\", which won an Ivor Novello award. Also recorded at the studios was Ocean Rain by Echo and The Bunnymen and Meat Is Murder by The Smiths. During this period at Amazon, Lewis had 20 Double Platinum, Platinum, Gold and Silver albums for records to show for his work, and 3 Ampex Gold Reel Awards. Lewis worked closely with a number of record producers who worked for a number of years at Amazon Studios. These record producers included Gil Norton, Ken Nelson and Ian Broudie. In order to keep the studio going in the 1990s, he moved the studio to a more desirable location in Liverpool city centre. In 1992, Lewis' major investor took over controlling interest in the company, which was deemed a coup by Keith Andrews. Following Lewis' involvement and construction of Parr Street Studios, it went on to win two separate Grammy Awards under a name change to Parr Street Studios. Lewis moved into the dot com industry in the mid-1990s and launched a number of successful companies, including Netscan UK. In April 2013 Lewis set up Jeremy J Lewis Guitars. This is a new concept series of one piece guitars (no bolted on neck) using proprietary all titanium hardware. In 2017, Lewis was granted a patent for the unique titanium Atlantic bridge used on the guitars. The new JJL guitars are currently the most expensive electric production guitars sold in the World today. The original company was forced to cease trading under shareholders agreement in 2019 when the two original investors unexpectedly declared bankruptcy and Lewis subsequently liquidated the company on 23rd April 2020. Lewis continued on his own and relaunched in 2019 with JJL Guitars Ltd and two new models, the Atlanta and the Vecta together with a new series of guitar stands, the first of which is the JJL air-stand Falcon. Parr Street Studios Lewis and his business partner, Tony Smith, were responsible for the contraction of the Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, United Kingdom. The 20,000 sq ft complex consisted of 4 studios, a restaurant, a bar, a hotel and 8 offices for commercial use. The property was completed in 1992 and after Lewis left his role with the studio, it was later sold for ¬£1.9 million in 2012.

Smith as \\"the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage\\". Smith argues that the topos is not simply a \\"straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism\\"; rather, it is \\"a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed\\".c.f. Nurse p. 1, who characterises it as arising from the complex religious and social turmoil provoked by the European Reformation of the sixteenth century. Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature and finds it in medieval texts such as Aucassin et Nicolette, The Consolation of Philosophy, the Roman de la Rose, and the Canterbury Tales.Harp p. 208 The topos was attacked by Christine de Pizan around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.Wolfthal p. 57 In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include Judith beheading Holofernes, Phyllis riding Aristotle, Samson and Delilah, Salome and her mother Herodias, Jael killing Sisera, Bathsheba bathing in sight of David, the idolatry of Solomon, Virgil in his basket, as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the battle for the trousers.Salomon, 87; \\"strijd om de broek\\" in sixteenth century Netherlandish literature and printmaking. Joseph and Potiphar's wife and Lot and his Daughters were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on.Russell, pp. 147‚Äì148, Nos 20‚Äì32 (Judith), 87‚Äì110, 120‚Äì125; Ainsworth, pp. 59‚Äì66; Salomon, pp. 87‚Äì88; Hall, 41‚Äì42 Tomyris, the Scythian queen who defeated Cyrus the Great and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.Hall, 305 These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or tableaux vivants.Snyder, 461 It is not clear who first coined the term Weibermacht, but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century Northern Renaissance in Germany and the Low Countries.Nurse p. 1 Visual arts In early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or \\"classical\\" ones such as Phyllis Riding Aristotle and Virgil in his Basket, in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the Assault on the Castle of Love, as on a casket in Baltimore. This and similar subjects of courtly love mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully.But not always. More typically the only real resistance is Cupid firing arrows. These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at tournaments.Loomis, Roger Sherman, \\"The Allegorical Siege in the Art of the Middle Ages\\", American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 23, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep., 1919), pp. 255‚Äì269,JSTOR (free) The Power of Women theme is especially popular in Northern Renaissance art from the sixteenth century, which depicts \\"images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness\\".Salomon, 87 Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilities exploited by many artists. The question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of Jael, whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with \\"bad\\" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of Hans Burgkmair's \\"Drei Gut Judin\\" (\\"Three Good Jewesses\\") trio of Biblical heroines in his Eighteen Worthies, adding nine women to the traditional male Nine Worthies.Russell, 29-39, No 1; Wolfthal, Diane (October 2000). Images of Rape: The Heroic Tradition and its Alternatives. Cambridge University Press. p. 123. ; Bohn, Babette (2005). The Artemisia Files \\"Death, Dispassion and the Female Hero:Gentileschi's Jael and Sisera\\". Chicago: University of Chicago Press. . Artemisia Gentileschi, Judith Slaying Holofernes, version in Florence, 1621 The Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but prints were their special home. Lucas van Leyden made two sets of woodcuts known as The Large and Small Power of Women. The subjects featured include Adam and Eve, Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, Herod and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, Jezebel and King Ahab. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from tableaux vivants of the scenes.Russell, pp. 119, 153, Large: Nos 90, 96, 100; Small: Nos 66, 92; Snyder, 461-462. The small set, of 1516-19 included the scenes with Eve, Jael, Delilah, Solomon, Jezebel and Herodias, the large set of c. 1512 added Virgil and the legend of the Bocca della Verit√† or \\"Mouth of Truth\\" in Rome. The Aristotle and Phyllis of c. 1515 is in the same format but may be a later addition. Since no museum has a full set on the same paper they may have been sold mainly singly. Another set by Hans Burgkmair (1519) is known as the Liebestorheiten or Follies of Love.Russell, p. 160, Nos 94, 97. This set contains: Samson and Delilah, Bathsheba and David, The Idolatry of Solomon, and Phyllis riding Aristotle. At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as Susanna, Dido of Carthage, Lucretia, and Verginia.Russell, Nos 1-14 The story of Esther lay somewhere between these two extremes.Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16 The Little Masters were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting Venice first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of Artemisia Gentileschi, who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, Cristofano Allori's best known work, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, uses as models his former mistress for Judith, with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of Holofernes.Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque, p.270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, In Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often.Ainsworth, p. 66 In 1513 Lucas Cranach the Elder decorated the nuptial bed of John, Elector of Saxony with a set of scenes including The Idolatry of Solomon as well as Hercules and Omphale (see below) and the Judgement of Paris. The respective sons of the patron and artist, John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Lucas Cranach the Younger, generated another set of paintings, now in the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister.Ainsworth, p. 62 The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many Judiths are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court;Ainsworth, pp. 63-66 some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits. =Themes and context= Phyllis Riding Aristotle, Lucas van Leyden Several of these subjects contain a part-comical element of role reversal in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the \\"quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, Phyllis Riding Aristotle.\\"Russell, p. 175 The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the Lai d'Aristote was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons.Boitani & Torti p. 82 The theme was first analysed by Natalie Zemon Davis in 1975,\\"Women on Top\\" in her Society and Culture in Early Modern France: Eight Essays, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1975 who concluded that the \\"overall functions\\" of these reversals was that \\"they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure\\".Natalie Zemon Davis, \\"Women on Top\\", quoted by Russell, p. 175 The role reversal subject of Hercules and Omphale did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.For a long analysis of the theme, see Rosenthal, Lisa, \\"Hercules' Distaff\\", especially p. 128 ff, in Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens, 2005, Cambridge University Press, , 9780521842440, Google Books Phyllis Riding Aristotle was painted on the walls of several German town halls,Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235 though the design Albrecht D√ºrer made for Nuremberg, as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out.Foister p. 2 Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall- mounted prints \\"must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women\\".Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235\\\\. D√ºrer's watercolour design is in the Morgan Library (see Commons image), and has roundels with Bathsheba and David, Samson and Delilah, and Phyllis riding Aristotle. Some of the Florentine Otto prints, essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.example, British Museum. This collection, in the British Museum is the pattern book of a workshop probably making inserts for small boxes of sweet delicacies such as were given to the guests at weddings. Other large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well- populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. David and Bathsheba or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.Bartrum, p. 154, Nos. 96, 158, 160; Parshall, pp. 234-235 The association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book Malleus Maleficarum (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of Hans Baldung Grien, the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the horror movies of their day.Zika, Charles, \\"Images of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe\\", in Levack, Brian P.

He was created by series creator Joe Weisberg and is portrayed by Noah Emmerich. Stan is an FBI agent and a neighbor of the lead characters, Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys), who are undercover Russian spies. Character historySeason one= Stan is an FBI counter-intelligence agent and moves to Northern Virginia with his wife, Sandra (Susan Misner) and his son, Matthew (Daniel Flaherty) across the street from Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys). Stan is unaware of the fact that Philip and Elizabeth are undercover KGB agents but becomes suspicious when he learns that a car similar to Philip's is seen near the site of a Soviet defector's abduction but finds nothing when he covertly inspects Philip's trunk. In the second episode, Stan blackmails Nina Sergeevna (Annet Mahendru), a Soviet embassy clerk, to spy for the FBI. Nina feeds Stan information about a Soviet agent who was killed the night Timochev went missing. As Stan gets to know Nina, he subsequently grows further apart from Sandra due to how much he works and is not able to spend time with his family. After Stan misses a family dinner due to work, a co-worker takes him to a bar and tells him to pick out a woman to have casual sex with. Stan instead calls Nina and they sleep together, but the way Nina conducts herself leads him to believe that she is using Stan and may be a double agent. She is tasked to try and turn Stan but starts to fall in love with him instead. Agent Frank Gaad (Richard Thomas), Stan's FBI supervisor, gives him the keys to a safe house and tells him to take Nina there, which then becomes their \\"love nest\\". On Stan's unauthorized initiative, the FBI seize Arkady's assistant Vlad, which leads Stan to return to the safe house and kill Vlad. When Nina asks about Vlad's death, Stan lies and promises her he will find out who killed him. When he gets home, Sandra asks him to quit the FBI and move. When he says no, she leaves him. He goes to Nina and attempts to end their affair, but ends up losing his resolve and sleeps with her instead. Nina does not trust what Stan is telling her about Vlad's death and after she gets promoted, she is given access to the material obtained by the Weinberger bug. She keeps the information from Stan in order to further investigate Vlad's death. Stan and Gaad continue to look for a thirty-something married couple and produce a sketch of them while Nina is sworn into Directorate S and, after a conversation with Stan, confesses her spying to Arkady and offers to become a re-doubled agent. Stan tells both Sandra and Nina that his mission will soon be over but Sandra rebuffs his attempt at reconciliation and Nina tells Arkady, who has accepted her offer in spite of Moscow's skepticism. =Season two= Nina informs Stan of a new arrival at the Rezidentura, Oleg Igorevich (Costa Ronin). Stan follows Oleg one night, only to have Oleg lead him to a port where he tells Stan that he is the only one who knows about Nina and threatens to expose her. Stan asks Nina to take a polygraph test if she wants to get exfiltrated. Arkady forces Stan's hand to steal the \\"Echo\\" program in exchange for Nina's safety. When Oleg pressures Stan more, Stan gives a surveillance log to Oleg and later promises to protect Nina. He drops a package at the agreed location, but it turns out to be only a note that says \\"Tell Nina I'm sorry\\". A heartbroken Nina leaves the Rezidentura to return to Moscow to stand trial for treason while Stan sadly watches her leave from a parked car. =Season three= Gaad informs Stan that Nina has been charged with espionage and treason. Stan tries again to reconcile with Sandra, trying to understand the EST she has been going to. He attends a session and asks Philip to go as well. Stan finds the training ridiculous and useless, much to Sandra's annoyance. Stan greets Zinaida Preobrazhenskaya (Svetlana Efremova), a defector from the Institute for US and Canadian Studies after arriving in a crate shipped to the FBI. Preobrazhenskaya discusses with Stan the Institute in Moscow she worked for, where their duties were to report to Soviet leadership on all aspects of geopolitical significance regarding the U.S. and Canada. She confides in Stan that she is glad that it is over, but he assures her that it is not. Stan is later held at gunpoint by Oleg Igorevich, who blames him for Nina's arrest and upcoming execution. Stan tells him that he loved Nina and if Oleg wants to shoot him, he can shoot him in the back and then walks away and gets in his car. He goes to Sandra, who is now living with another man, and tells her that he could not think of anyone else he wanted to tell what had just happened other than her. While she does comfort him, she also tells him that she is not coming back to him. Stan goes back to an EST meeting, only to voice his opinion of it. Instead of being met with hostility, he gets applauded. Afterwards, he is asked out on a date by a woman named Tori (Callie Thorne), also from the meeting. They have dinner at the Jennings house and, despite admitting that he still considers Sandra his wife, he and Tori have sex. Casting Emmerich was initially hesitant about taking a role in the series. He explained: \\"The truth is, from the very beginning, I thought, \\"I don't want to do a TV show where I carry a gun or a badge. I'm done with guns and badges. I just don't want to do that anymore.\\" When I first read it I thought, \\"Yeah, it's really interesting and really good, but I don't want to be an FBI guy.\\" His friend, Gavin O'Connor, who directed the pilot episode, convinced him to take a closer look at the role. Emmerich stated that \\"within 20 minutes of talking to Joe, it became abundantly clear that his interests were not procedural\\". Reception Slate called Stan \\"the show's most heartbreaking character,\\" with being a victim of his own work ethic, losing a partner, losing his marriage, becoming estranged from his son, and falling in love with a double agent. Emmerich said of Beeman, \\"He's pretty much losing everything in his life. His extracurricular life is in a Russian prison, his wife is leaving him, his son won't talk to him. What more can go wrong? It's tough. But hopefully it's the nadir of Stan's troubles. He's about to bounce back strong and hard‚Äîthat's my hope for Stan.\\" For his role as Beeman, Emmerich was nominated at the 2013 Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series but lost out to Michael Cudlitz.

A Home lift is complies with global standards of Machine Directive 2006 42 EC which complies to 194 parameters of safety for a lift to be installed inside a private property. Home lifts are compact lifts for 2 to 6 persons. Unlike hydraulic lifts or traditional \\"gear and counterweight\\" operated elevators, a home lift doesn't require additional space for machine room, over head, or pit, making it more suitable for domestic and private use. Often, maintenance costs are also lower than a more conventional lift. The driving system for a home lift is often built inside the lift structure itself and features a screw, an electric motor, and a nut mounted behind the control panel of the lift's platform; it is thus referred to as a \\"screw and nut\\" system. When the lift is operated, the engine forces the nut to rotate around the screw, pushing the lift up and down. Most home lifts come with an open platform structure to free even more space and grant access from 3 different sides of the platform. This requires all producers to include specific safety mechanisms and, in some countries, to limit the travel speed. Home lifts have been present on the market for decades, and represent a growing trend. Most common producers are based in Europe, such as the Sweden-based Aritco Lifts AB, active since 1995, British manufacturer Wessex Lift Co. Ltd., active since 1976. Many home lifts producers sell their products through their own network, but it is not rare to see them providing their lifts to bigger elevating system groups. Several lift manufacturers enter new markets like India with customization and installation partners who have scaled up their technical capabilities.  Types of home lifts  Cable-driven home lifts = Cable- driven home lifts consist of a shaft, a cabin, a control system and counterweights. Some models also require a technical room. Cable-driven lifts are similar to those found in commercial buildings. These elevators take up most space due to the shaft and the equipment room, so installing a cable system in a new building is much easier than trying to retrofit an existing building. Traction elevators need a pulley system for movement. They are less common for new buildings, as hydraulic technology is used in most cases. = Chain-driven home lifts = Chain-driven home lifts are similar to cable- driven lifts, but they use a chain wrapped around a drum instead of a cable to raise and lower the car. Chains are more durable than cables and do not need to be replaced as often. Chain-driven home lifts also do not require a separate machine room, which saves space. = Machine room-less home lifts = Machine room-less home lifts operate by sliding up and down a travel path with a counterweight. This type is an excellent choice for existing residential buildings, since neither machine rooms nor pits reaching into the ground are required. However, traction elevators still require additional space above the elevator roof to accommodate the components required to raise and lower the car. Shaftless home lifts consist of a rectangular elevator cabin positioned on a rail. The lift travels on the route from the lower floor to the upper floor and back. = Hydraulic home lifts = Hydraulic home lifts are driven by a piston that moves in a cylinder. Since the drive system is completely housed in the elevator shaft, no machine room is required and the control system is small enough to fit into a cabinet on a wall near the elevator. For hydraulic systems with holes, the cylinder must extend to the depth of the floor corresponding to the feet of the elevator, while hydraulic systems without holes do not require a pit. = Pneumatic home lifts = Pneumatic home lifts use a vacuum system inside a tube to drive their movement. A pit or machine room is not required, so pneumatic home lifts are easiest to retrofit into an existing home. Pneumatic lifts consist of acrylic tubes or glass (typically about 80 cm in diameter). It look like a mail tube you may know from films or older buildings. Pneumatic elevators are not hidden in the wall and are normally placed in the near to a staircase. Home lifts ‚Äì English Paper. Retrieved 2020-07-12. = Electric home lifts = Electric home lifts are powered by an electric motor that plugs into a 13-amp power socket, like any other household appliance. They use a steel roped drum-braked gear motor drive system which means it is self-contained within the roof space of the lift car itself. 'Through floor' dual rail lifts create a self-supporting structure and the weight of the entire structure and lift are in compression through the rails into the floor of the home.

Aside from hosting music and arts, the event's main target is to raise funds for a monkey sanctuary in El Chapar, Bolivia. The festival site is 150 meters from the beach and the organisers aim to present emerging artists from both sides of the English channel. French national newspaper Le Monde reviewed the festival in 2014, calling it \\"a secret little paradise\\". At the fourth edition of the festival, broadcaster TV5 Monde reviewed the festival highlighting the originality of the programming and praised the family friendly atmosphere. Association Pete the Monkey  Created following the success of a viral video, the Pete the Monkey association offers financial support towards building ‚ÄòJacj Cuisi‚Äô, the biggest monkey sanctuary in Bolivia, situated where Amazonian monkeys are victims of criminal trafficking. History The festival started as a 350-person party. By the third edition in 2014, the festival had grown into a boutique size 1000 capacity themed festival. The fourth edition in July 2015 was sold out prior the event with 1500 weekend tickets. The organisers aim to keep festival at a small size. Le Monde interviewed the festival co-director to talk about the impact of boutique festivals in France. The festival was nominated at the 2015 AIM Awards for Best Independent Festival. Pete the Monkey mentality The festival is curated as a family-friendly affair during the day; but at night gigs and DJ's take over to cater for a more adult crowd. The festival sets a theme every year. Costumes and fancy dress are encouraged. The themes are: Mother nature (2012), Where the wild things are (2013), A walk on the wild side (2014). The theme for 2015 was phrased in French as: \\"Les naufrag√©s de la jungle\\", which literally translates as 'Shipwrecked in the jungle'. It comes from a French title of a children's adventure story written by Howard Pease. Previous Line-up Previous lineups include: Jupiter & Okwess International, Acid Arab, Loyle Carner, Jacques, Isaac delusion, Thylacine, La Yegros, Blue Hawaii, We Were Evergreen, London Contemporary Voices, Cl√©a Vincent, Babe, Bon Voyage Organisation, Fishbach, Palace, Peter and Kerry, Agua Roja, L‚Äôimperatrice, Camp Claude, Cubenx, Robyn Sherwell, Khushi, Emile Omar and Flairs.

Stages The main music and arts are celebrated over two stages, with a third stage providing late night revelry. =Main Stage= This stage hosts most of the bands. The stage is set up on an old tennis court, on two large tractor trailers. =Barn stage= This stage is open to DJs for late night partying. =Acoustic stage= This stage is situated under a big oak tree, and serves as a more intimate space for smaller more acoustic based bands. =Silent stage= This stage is situated in the forest area, and serves live music and DJ sets through wireless headphones.

Because this understanding assumes a natural link between descriptions and the events so described it also assumes a non-linguistic sense of the world as the final arbiter of the in/accuracy of descriptions. For DP, SSK and MCA, however, there can be no socially meaningful sense of the non-linguistic without the founding, constitutive force of language. Although language might not be all there is in the world, it is, nevertheless, all there is in the world that allows for the world to become accountable and knowable to ourselves and others. And once you reject‚Äîas these approaches reject‚Äîthe possibility of some non-linguistic arbiter of accuracy, it follows that all descriptions (whether those we decide to treat as accurate or those we do not) have to be understood as the products of particular, locally specific contexts. The issue is no longer whether mediated texts transmit in/accurate in-formation, but how they act as \\"vehicles for action\\",Stivers, T., Sidnell, J. (2013) Introduction, in J. Sidnell, T. Stivers (eds.) The Handbook of Conversation Analysis. Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, pp. 1-8. where such actions might include defending someone, accusing someone, confessing to something, or any number of other things. It is here that we see how an ethnomethodological approach to language opens the possibility for a mediated stylistics; that is, for analytical tools traditionally associated with stylistics to be adopted for use within media studies. A journalist writing a news article about 'real events' and a novelist constructing a plausible-yet-imaginary-world may well be working with different materials, but they are both engaged in essentially the same kind of literary task: building descriptive vehicles with the potential to pull off a certain set of contextually specific actions such as detailing, characterizing, informing, confessing, defending, accusing, and so on, in what constitutes an infinitely extendable list of other such social actions.Jeffries, L., McIntyre, D. (2010) Stylistics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.Jeffries, L. (2007) Journalistic constructions of Blair's \\"apology\\" for the intelligence leading to the Iraq War, in S. Johnson, A. Ensslin (eds.) Language in the Media: Representations, Identities, Ideologies. London: Continuum, pp. 48-69. Study So what does this all of this mean in practice? Traditionally, stylistics has treated literature‚Äîwhether institutionally sanctioned Literature (with a capital \\"L\\") or more popular non-canonical forms of literary writing‚Äîas its primary focus.Simpson, P. (2004) Stylistics. London: Routledge. Mediated stylistics, however, in taking seriously the idea that journalists are the \\"professional storytellers of our age\\",Bell, A. (1991) The Language of News Media. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 147. orients towards the types of creativity and innovation in language-use that are required in and for the construction of mediated stories. This shift in empirical focus requires a shift in analytic focus. For although literary and mediated texts both tell stories, they do so in differing ways. In that stylistics asks how certain aesthetic effects are achieved through the language of a literary text,Simpson, P. (1992) 'Teaching stylistics: analysing cohesion and narrative structure', Language and Literature, 1(1): 47-67. it is able to assume that the text in question represents a story in which characters, plot, events, etc. have all been constructed by that text's author (e.g. Burton's analysis of Plath's prose, 1982).Burton, D. (1982) 'Through glass darkly: through dark glasses', in R. Carter, D. Burton (eds.) Literary Text and Language Study. London: Arnold, pp. 195-214. Media texts, on the other hand, almost always involve attempts to translate‚Äîor recontextualise‚Äîcharacters, plots and events that have already been constructed elsewhere, by others, in a different context. Unlike other forms of stylistics, then, mediated stylistics is interested not in one-off stories, but in the various iterations of a story that are reproduced over time and across various contexts. This contrasts with the extremely insightful, but different, form of stylistics developed by Leslie Jeffries known as critical stylistics.Jeffries, L. (2010) Critical Stylistics. Basingstoke: Palgrave.Jeffries, L. (2010) Opposition in Discourse. London: Continuum An example One recent example is Attenborough's article 'Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women' (2014). This article studies mediated reportage of the charges of rape and sexual molestation made against Julian Assange, the editor-in-chief of the organisation WikiLeaks, in late 2010.Attenborough, F. (2014) \\"Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women,\\" Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict, 2(2): 183‚Äì203. This event was rich with recontextualising possibilities: during the appeal hearing in which Assange's lawyers challenged the warrant for his arrest, transcripts of the witness statements that had led to the warrant being issued were leaked online. Media commentators took this opportunity to build their own recontextualised descriptions of what actually happened as the (apparently) factual starting points for their own, subsequent evaluations of the (un)fairness and/or (il)legitimacy of the allegations. An analysis of media reports in which those witness statements were passed-on to the public subsequently reveals the textual practices through which Assange's allegedly violent actions were often recontextualised such that their status as violent was readably downgraded, mitigated or even deleted. Eastern Europe Media stylistics as a research approach is widely known in Eastern Europe and especially in Russia, through the work of A. Vasileva, M. Kozhina, V. Kostomarov, L. Maydanova, I.

It provides both electronic trading platforms and back-office software to manage a company's operations through its various subsidiaries. It has offices in Cyprus, Hong Kong, Israel, Ukraine, China, Poland and Germany. History Leverate was founded in 2008 by, Doron Cohen, Itai Damti, and Doron Somech who had worked together on the project since 2006.{{cite weblast1=Jandovafirst1=Zuzanatitle=Interview with dave, the CEO at Leverate The original idea was to create a trading algorithm for the purpose of buying and selling that was completely automated. It took two years to build the platform and the company was launched officially in 2008. Leverate received its first angel investment in 2008 from Jacques Beer, owner and chief executive officer of Tempo Beverages Ltd. The company saw a limit to the use of the algorithm and instead turned it into a price feed for brokers that helped reduce losses incurred by latency. Leverate discontinued the use of its algorithm in 2008 and began to market products to brokers. One of the features of the algorithm was a product feed that was described as \\"fast\\" and \\"accurate.\\" The company began using the feed to help brokers who had a lack of knowledge of market conditions. The feed became Leverate's initial product offering, referred to as LXFeed. Leverate moved from algorithm trading into the SaaS market with the product launch, leading to the development of additional products that include risk management tools and mobile trading platforms. Leverate expanded its operations in 2011 by adding 20 employees to its staff of 50. The company was able to do so after selling a 25% stake to Saxo Bank for $12.5 million (USD). It also expanded its presence by opening a financial services branch in Hong Kong in 2012 and an office in Ukraine in 2013. Leverate entered into an agreement with Saxo Bank in 2014 to buy back that company's 25% stake in the company. In November 2017,Leverate launched Cyprus-based regulatory consulting and services operation Regyoul8, The financial Certification services the Edu8, and the new generation trading platforms. Products Leverate's first product was its LXFeed which launched in 2008. It released a risk management system in 2009. The same year it began to bundle its products and release them under the name LXSuite while also allowing companies to purchase stand alone products. In 2010 it launched a platform called LXAPI which allowed users the ability to customize platforms. It also released LXCRM as a customer management tool for brokers. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin were added to its LXFeed in 2014. Leverate ventured into the social trading marketing by launching Sirix Social Community and The new generation Activ8. The community allows members to view and copy other trader's portfolios, creating transparency in currency pairs, as well as integrating with MetaTrader 4.

Kubyauk-gyi) temple, located just south of Bagan, Myanmar, in Myinkaba Village, is a Buddhist temple built in 1113 AD by Prince Yazakumar, shortly after the death of his father, King Kyansittha of the Pagan Dynasty. The temple is notable for two reasons. First, it contains a large array of well-preserved frescoes on its interior walls, the oldest original paintings to be found in Bagan. All of the frescoes are accompanied by ink captions written in Old Mon, providing one of the earliest examples of the language's use in Myanmar. Second, the temple is located just to the west of the Myazedi pagoda, at which was found two stone pillars with inscriptions written in four, ancient Southeast Asian languages: Pali, Old Mon, Old Burmese, and Pyu. The inscription on the pillar displayed by the Myazedi pagoda has been called the Burmese Rosetta Stone, given its significance both historically and linguistically, as a key to cracking the Pyu language. Physical Description The style of the temple includes both Mon and Indian elements. In the case of the latter, the temple's towers are built in the Indian Shikhara style. The temple has a square base, shaped like a Kalatha pot, with a curvilinear roof. The interior of the temple contains a large, perimeter vestibule that connects to a small shrine room, a temple entrance leading to the vestibule, and an interior hallway leading to the shrine room. Both the shrine room and the entrance to the temple are on the east side of the building. The temple has 11 large, perforated, Pyu-style windows, which let in very little light. Nine of the windows are in the outer walls, and two are interior windows. The windows' perforations are shaped in a variety of ways, including as Banyan leaves and swastikas. Stucco Ornamentation In the interior above these windows are terraces with small Buddha figures, backed by intricate, ornamental stucco carvings with floral designs. Other stucco designs that can be seen in Gubyaukgyi include concentric rings and ogre figurines. There are also, in the walls, 34 recesses, each of which used to contain a statue of Buddha. Due to vandalism, however, only 19 of these statues remain. HistoryConstruction= A popular retelling of the temple's construction goes as follows. Several decades before the construction of Gubyaukgyi, the wife of King Kyansittha, Queen Thanbula, became pregnant. At the time, the king had no son, and as such no direct heir to the throne. When the king learned of the queen's pregnancy, he asked her to leave the royal court. Upon leaving the court, he gave her a valuable ring. He told the queen that, if the baby were a boy, she would be welcomed back to the court, and would return the ring. If the baby were a girl, she was told she could sell the ring and should not return to the court. The baby was a boy, Prince Yazakumar. However, by the time the queen returned to the king with their son, he had already promised his daughter's son, Alaungsithu, that he would be the heir to the kingdom. To compensate Yazakumar for his losing the chance to inherit the throne, the king gave him a large amount of land. Yazakumar sold much of this land, and with the proceeds built Gubyaukgyi, out of appreciation for his father. To build the temple, Yazakumar employed three villages of slaves. =Background Behind Mon Style of Temple= Gubyaukgyi temple Around 1054 AD, the Burmese monarch and founder of the Pagan Empire Aniruddha conquered the Mon capital of Thaton. After doing so, he brought back to Bagan the Mon king Makuta, several copies of the Tipitaka written in Mon, as well as numerous Mon monks and artists. Shortly thereafter, Makuta, while still a captive in Bagan, constructed the Mon-style Hindu Nanpaya temple in Myinkaba Village, a mile south of the city. This prompted the construction of numerous more Mon-style temples in Bagan during the next century, from 1060-1160 AD, including Gubyaukgyi. Almost all Mon-style temples in Bagan were built during this century, and likewise, almost all of these temples have Mon language inscriptions. =Damage and Restoration= A 1982 UNESCO report concerning the conservation of 16 Bagan temples and monuments revealed a number of issues relating to the physical condition of Gubyaukgyi. On the exterior, the original cornice was lost, and in its place black algae and lichens had developed. A blue green lichen was further found lower on the exterior. Meanwhile, multiple areas of stucco were in danger of detachment. Interiorly, the entrance hallway had undergone extensive damage from earthquakes. The researchers also discovered insect damage and areas where the consolidant polyvinyl acetate had been applied to stabilize flaking paint. Due to these issues, a 1984 joint UNESCO/UNDP project was launched to look into preserving several Bagan temples and monuments. The project came to fruition, and by 1991, a restoration of Gubyaukgyi was complete. The temple's interior frescoes were extensively cleaned, panels and stucco at risk of detachment were fortified, and anti-insect chemicals were applied. At the same time, electrical equipment, including lights, were installed in the temple.  3D Documentation  The Zamani Project from the University of Cape Town, South Africa, offered its services towards the spatial documentation of monuments in Bagan in response to the destruction of monuments by an earthquake in August 2016. After reconnaissance visit to Bagan and a subsequent meeting at the UNESCO offices in Bangkok in February 2017, the Zamani Project documented 12 monuments in Bagan, during 3 field campaigns between 2017-2018, including the Gubyaukgyi (Kubyauk-gyi) Temple (298). The other 11 monuments documented by the Zamani Project are; Kyauk-ku-umin (154); Tha-peik-hmauk-gu-hpaya (744); Sula-mani-gu-hpaya (Sulamani)(748) Monument 1053; Sein-nyet-ama (1085); Sein- nyet-nyima (1086); Naga-yon-hpaya (1192); Loka-ok-shaung (1467); Than-daw-kya (1592); Ananda Monastery; and the City Gate of old Bagan (Tharabha Gate). Textured 3D models, panorama tours, elevations, sections and plans of some of those structures are available on www.zamaniproject.org. A video of the textured 3D model of the Kubyaub-gyi Temple was also created. MuralsJƒÅtakas= JƒÅtaka Murals The Gubyaukgyi temple has 547 well-preserved paintings depicting various JƒÅtakas originated entirely from Sri Lanka depicting the island's historical chronicles - Mahavensa. Temple built in 1113 by Prince Rajakumar, son of King Kyansittha who painted a large number of episodes from the Mahavamsa on the Gubyaukgyi temple walls. These include panels depicting Arahant Mahinda, and King Devanmpiyatissa, the national hero Dutugamunu and his elephant Kandula as well as Prince Gamini sending women's attire to his father for refusing to fight for the freedom of the country. The invader Elara is depicted in true Mahavamsa style as a just and fair king. His bell of justice is shown together with the calf that wore it - a story known to every child in contemporary Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's historical events depicted on the walls end with the great Sri Lankan King Vijayabahu - the contemporary of Rajakumar. Among them the stories of Buddha's previous lives as seen by Sri Lankans at that time. Each of these paintings has an ink caption written in Old Mon; in fact, Gubyaukgyi's murals with their accompanying captions are the most complete collection of JƒÅtakas in Old Mon in the world. Each panel in the mural measures 1' 5\\" by 1' 5\\". The JƒÅtaka panels begin on the third row of paintings on the eastern, outer wall of the vestibule, to one's immediate left as one enters the temple's entrance (the left as one enters). They then wrap around (south to west to north to east) seven times, ending on the ninth row of paintings on the outer wall. Unlike JƒÅtaka paintings seen in other Bagan temples, such as the Ananda Temple, Gubyaukgyi's are unnumbered; the paintings' good condition and detailed captions have made identification simple, however. =Bengali Influence on Textiles in Temple Paintings= One of King Kyansittha's wives, Abeyadana, is believed to have originated from Pattikera, a region in the Comilla district of southeast Bengal. As such it is likely that the king developed diplomatic relations with the region around the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th centuries. A further sign that there was a cultural exchange between the Pagan Empire and east India/Bengal at the time is that most late 11th and early 12th century temples in Bagan have Bihar or Bengal style painting. One way that stylistic motifs entered Bagan was through textile imports. These textiles were used not just for garments, but also were used for Buddhist shrines. The patterns seen on the textiles depicted in Gubyaukgyi's murals show Bengali influence. Textiles can be found in the temple's paintings in multiple contexts: on cushions Buddha is leaning on, in the form of fabrics spread below Buddha's throne, in pavilions under which Buddha is seated, and as garments worn by disciplines of Buddha. Scholar Claudine Bautze-Picron has found three primary similarities between the stylistic motifs on textiles in Gubyaukgyi's paintings and those popular in contemporaneous Bengal. First is prominent use of repeated patterns of geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, diamonds, and hexagons, which can be seen in the garb of some of Buddha's royal disciples. The second similarity is striped patterns, especially around deities' legs. Finally, textiles seen in the temple's murals use the motif of scrolls extended like arabesques into repeated circles.

It was released for Windows, macOS, and Linux on September 29, 2015. The Wii U version was released on September 8, 2016, while the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released on September 9, 2016. The Nintendo Switch version was released on April 27, 2018. The Stadia version was released on May 26, 2020. Plot The story follows Thora, a recently deceased Viking woman. Having suffered an inglorious death, she must travel across the realms defeating J√∂tunn, giant elementals of nature, chaos, power, etc. This will allow her to impress the gods and enter Valhalla. After defeating the plant giant Jera, the lightning giant Hagalaz, the ice giant Isa, the fire giant Kaunan, and the warrior giant F√©, she fights against Odin himself. Having proven herself, she is ascended to Valhalla. Gameplay J√∏tun uses a hand drawn, frame-by-frame art style. Aside from the boss battles, the game revolves around exploration and puzzle solving, with a few enemies to fight. Exploration typically involves exploring various stages, with some giants to fight and various puzzles to solve. Puzzles often employ using axe swings to interact with objects (i.e. trees, boulders, and vines) and some other types of puzzles. In each stage, there is a Rune, an object the player must reach to continue the story, and a God Shrine, at which Thora can unlock and upgrade God Powers. There are also secret locations containing Ithunn's Apples, which give a permanent buff to Thora's health. Combat in the game is relatively rudimentary, with the main actions being an axe swing, axe chop, and dodge. The axe swing is the game's heavy attack: it takes a long time to perform, but does more damage than the axe chop. The axe chop is a light attack, which can be performed in a 2-hit combo, or a 3-hit combo and does small amounts of damage. Finally, the dodge is a roll, which the players can use to avoid attacks and (after the 2-hit combo) can dodge and swing for a third strike. Players can also use one of the God Powers: Frigg's Healing, Freya's Speed, Thor's Hammer, Odin's Spear, Loki's Decoy, or Heimdall's Shield. God Powers initially start off with two charges, but only a few can be upgraded to three, but all may be replenished at Mimir's Wells. The hub of the game is known as Ginnungagap (the Void), from which players can access five areas. Each area consists of two stages, with the exception of Jera (which only has one stage). Once Thora collects the rune of both stages, she can advance to the boss fight, where she fights one of the five giants. After defeating the boss of the area, Thora will give some information about her life before her death. Development The game was first announced at PAX 2015, accompanied by screenshots and a gameplay video. The game was released in September 2015 on PC, and will later be on consoles. The game had a successful crowdfunding campaign which raised over $64,000 from 2,299 backers on Kickstarter. Additional funding came from the Canadian Media Fund and the Montreal Inc Foundation.  Release  In October 2016, Thunder Lotus Games joined forces with the subscription box company, IndieBox, to create an exclusive physical release of J√∏tun. This limited, individually-numbered collector's edition included a DRM-Free game disc, original soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and several custom-designed collectibles. Reception J√∏tun has a score of 79/100 on Metacritic. Game Revolution awarded the game 4.5 out of 5, saying \\"All told, Jotun is a wonderful experience with just a few sour notes.\\" IGN awarded it a score of 8.0 out of 10, saying \\"Jotun is a wondrous trek through Norse mythology and the imposing giant bosses that inhabit its rich, beautiful world.\\" GameSpot awarded it a score of 8.0 out of 10, saying \\"I want to hear Thora tell her tale again. Any good bedtime story that makes you want to hear it again right after it‚Äôs over is one for the ages.\\" Other media Thora is featured as one of the playable characters in the indie crossover fighting game Bounty Battle.

Stone, written by Berkeley Anderson and stars Corin Nemec, Yancy Butler and Robert Englund. The film premiered on April 25, 2015 on Syfy. It is a crossover between the Anaconda and 'Lake Placid series, and the fifth installment in both their respective series. The film is also the final installment in the Anaconda series. It is followed by Lake Placid: Legacy (2018). Plot After surviving the attack in Lake Placid: The Final Chapter, Jim Bickerman, due to his injuries, is left with an eye patch, hook and wooden leg. Working in Black Lake, Maine, with another mercenary named Beach, they capture a female giant crocodile. They take it back to their truck, where two scientists crossbreed its blood with a female giant anaconda to perfect a Blood Orchid serum. However, the crocodile escapes, killing a scientist and freeing a female and two male anacondas before causing the truck to explode. The explosion destroys part of the electric fence keeping the crocodiles in Black Lake. Beach, Bickerman, and the one remaining scientist survive. However, a small group of crocodiles also escape. The crocodiles search for food, and one kills Daphne Mailer and her boyfriend, while another kills the remaining scientist, and multiple baby crocodiles kill a poacher. The crocodiles eventually make their way to nearby Clear Lake, along with the anacondas. Sheriff Reba calls U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officer Will \\"Tully\\" Tull to help recapture the escaped crocodiles. Meanwhile, a group of college sorority girls from Delta Gamma, led by Tiffani and Amber, and two fraternity boys from Sigma Phi, Brett and Andrew, arrive at Clear Lake to initialize some new members, including Margo and Tully's daughter, Bethany. The crocodiles kill devour sorority girls along with Amber (whom Tiffani pushes towards the crocodiles), Brett, Andrew and Heather (the latter three who were wakeboarding). The survivors run into the forest to get to the cars. However, the girls left the keys on the beach. But the crocodiles attacks the students. One of the girls, Cassie, runs out of Jennifer's car, but a crocodile eats her. Tiffani's car is crushed by an anaconda with Jennifer still inside. A crocodile kills Tiffani and the others flee. Deputy Ferguson, discovers one of the surviving sorority girls hiding on a boat. The traumatized girl, Melissa, is taken to a hospital, while Tully and Reba continue to search for Bethany. Clear Lake is evacuated by Ferguson. Sarah Murdoch, daughter of the late Peter \\"J.D.\\" Murdoch and CEO of Wexel Hall Corporation in New York, leads a team of herself, Beach, Bickerman and two mercenaries and go to capture the female anaconda before it lays its eggs. However, one of the mercenaries is attacked by a crocodile, and Beach is forced to shoot them both. Tully and Reba are attacked by a crocodile, which is in turn attacked by an anaconda, which crushes the crocodile until it explodes. The anaconda then escapes. Sarah's group steals a boat, but Bickerman falls off and is dragged underwater by a crocodile. After landing, the other mercenary is killed by an anaconda. Tully and Reba kill the other anaconda and rescue Bethany, Margo and Jane. They regroup along with Ferguson until Sarah and Beach arrive. They discover two crocodiles eating a male anaconda. The female anaconda appears and kills a crocodile, and a crocodile flings the male anaconda into a helicopter, containing Sarah's extraction team, causing it to crash. The female anaconda kills the crocodile and eats Beach alive, who sacrifices his life by detonating a grenade and killing the anaconda that swallowed him. Sarah is arrested, and Bickerman emerges from the lake, laughing maniacally. The film ends focusing on the nest of eggs laid by the female anaconda. One hatches to reveal a baby anaconda with crocodile-like attributes.

(Only two other such gases are currently known: nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO).) The gas is produced from cysteine by the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase. It acts as a relaxant of smooth muscle and as a vasodilator and is also active in the brain, where it increases the response of the NMDA receptor and facilitates long term potentiation, which is involved in the formation of memory. Eventually the gas is converted to sulfite in the mitochondria by thiosulfate reductase, and the sulfite is further oxidized to thiosulfate and sulfate by sulfite oxidase. The sulfates are excreted in the urine. Due to its effects similar to nitric oxide (without its potential to form peroxides by interacting with superoxide), hydrogen sulfide is now recognized as potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease. The cardioprotective role effect of garlic is caused by catabolism of the polysulfide group in allicin to , a reaction that could depend on reduction mediated by glutathione. Though both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide have been shown to relax blood vessels, their mechanisms of action are different: while NO activates the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, activates ATP- sensitive potassium channels in smooth muscle cells. Researchers are not clear how the vessel-relaxing responsibilities are shared between nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. However, there exists some evidence to suggest that nitric oxide does most of the vessel-relaxing work in large vessels and hydrogen sulfide is responsible for similar action in smaller blood vessels.\\"Toxic Gas, Lifesaver\\", Scientific American, March 2010 Recent findings suggest strong cellular crosstalk of NO and , demonstrating that the vasodilatatory effects of these two gases are mutually dependent. Additionally, reacts with intracellular S-nitrosothiols to form the smallest S-nitrosothiol (HSNO), and a role of hydrogen sulfide in controlling the intracellular S-nitrosothiol pool has been suggested. Like nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide is involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle that causes erection of the penis, presenting possible new therapy opportunities for erectile dysfunction. Hydrogen sulfide () deficiency can be detrimental to the vascular function after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMIs can lead to cardiac dysfunction through two distinct changes; increased oxidative stress via free radical accumulation and decreased NO bioavailability. Free radical accumulation occurs due to increased electron transport uncoupling at the active site of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme involved in converting L-arginine to NO. During an AMI, oxidative degradation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor in NO production, limits BH4 availability and limits NO productionby eNOS. Instead, eNOS reacts with oxygen, another cosubstrates involved in NO production. The products of eNOS are reduced to superoxides, increasing free radical production and oxidative stress within the cells. A deficiency impairs eNOS activity by limiting Akt activation and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site. Instead, Akt activity is increased to phosphorylate the eNOST495 inhibition site, downregulating eNOS production of NO. therapy uses a donor, such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS), to increase the supply of to an AMI patient. donors reduce myocardial injury and reperfusion complications. Increased levels within the body will react with oxygen to produce sulfane sulfur, a storage intermediate for . pools in the body attracts oxygen to react with excess and eNOS to increase NO production. With increased use of oxygen to produce more NO, less oxygen is available to react with eNOS to produce superoxides during an AMI, ultimately lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, decreased accumulation of ROS lowers oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing oxidative degeneration of BH4. Increased BH4 cofactor contributes to increased production of NO within the body. Higher concentrations of directly increase eNOS activity through Akt activation to increase phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site, and decrease phosphorylation of the eNOST495 inhibition site. This phosphorylation process upregulates eNOS activity, catalyzing more conversion of L-arginine to NO. Increased NO production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, leading to an increased conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3‚Äô,5‚Äô-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In therapy immediately following an AMI, increased cGMP triggers an increase in protein kinase G (PKG) activity. PKG reduces intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle to increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood flow. PKG also limits smooth muscle cell proliferation, reducing intima thickening following AMI injury, ultimately decreasing myocardial infarct size. In Alzheimer's disease the brain's hydrogen sulfide concentration is severely decreased. In a certain rat model of Parkinson's disease, the brain's hydrogen sulfide concentration was found to be reduced, and administering hydrogen sulfide alleviated the condition. In trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) the body produces an excess of hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is also involved in the disease process of type 1 diabetes. The beta cells of the pancreas in type 1 diabetes produce an excess of the gas, leading to the death of these cells and to a reduced production of insulin by those that remain. In 2005, it was shown that mice can be put into a state of suspended animation-like hypothermia by applying a low dosage of hydrogen sulfide (81 ppm ) in the air. The breathing rate of the animals sank from 120 to 10 breaths per minute and their temperature fell from 37 ¬∞C to just 2 ¬∞C above ambient temperature (in effect, they had become cold-blooded). The mice survived this procedure for 6 hours and afterwards showed no negative health consequences.Mice put in 'suspended animation', BBC News, 21 April 2005 In 2006 it was shown that the blood pressure of mice treated in this fashion with hydrogen sulfide did not significantly decrease.Gas induces 'suspended animation', BBC News, 9 October 2006 A similar process known as hibernation occurs naturally in many mammals and also in toads, but not in mice. (Mice can fall into a state called clinical torpor when food shortage occurs). If the -induced hibernation can be made to work in humans, it could be useful in the emergency management of severely injured patients, and in the conservation of donated organs. In 2008, hypothermia induced by hydrogen sulfide for 48 hours was shown to reduce the extent of brain damage caused by experimental stroke in rats. As mentioned above, hydrogen sulfide binds to cytochrome oxidase and thereby prevents oxygen from binding, which leads to the dramatic slowdown of metabolism. Animals and humans naturally produce some hydrogen sulfide in their body; researchers have proposed that the gas is used to regulate metabolic activity and body temperature, which would explain the above findings.Mark B. Roth and Todd Nystul. Buying Time in Suspended Animation. Scientific American, 1 June 2005 Two recent studies cast doubt that the effect can be achieved in larger mammals. A 2008 study failed to reproduce the effect in pigs, concluding that the effects seen in mice were not present in larger mammals. Likewise a paper by Haouzi et al. noted that there is no induction of hypometabolism in sheep, either. At the February 2010 TED conference, Mark Roth announced that hydrogen sulfide induced hypothermia in humans had completed Phase I clinical trials. The clinical trials commissioned by the company he helped found, Ikaria, were however withdrawn or terminated by August 2011.

Since cockroaches are \\"awesome coping machines\\" which do not possess significant capacity for angst, despair, or introspection, \\"Jerry Blatta\\" (as he becomes known) quickly learns to walk on two legs instead of six, to recognize himself in a mirror, to dress and feed himself, to ward off predators by constantly showing his teeth, to play chess, and, Chauncey Gardiner-like, to fake his way through conversations.

Drafted in March 2014, the bill was passed after being sent back to the floor by President Thein Sein with 25 proposed changes, 19 of which were accepted. From the beginning of its drafting process, the law faced criticism from students and teachers unions as well as various civil society groups. Concerns over the law later turned into protests, which were eventually cracked down by the government. National Education Law 2014 Section 1 includes definition of terms used in the law. As laid out in Section 2, the main objectives of the law are to train students to become critical thinkers; to nurture students to become law-abiding citizens with democratic principles; to enable students to become citizens who could pass down their ethnic languages, traditions, literature and to value historical heritage and environmental sustainability; to enhance human resources in preparation for economic development and higher standards of living; to provide a learning environment that is up to date with international standards and to improve teaching, learning and research by using technology information and communication information; to help students excel in their own fields of interest; and to promote sportsmanship and school health projects. Section 3 of the law covers the fundamental policies of the law that include providing education for students with disabilities; providing education relevant to the lives of the students; and granting autonomy of colleges and universities. Section 4 outlines the formation of National Education Commission that will consist of ministers from related sectors, experts from nationality groups and relevant individuals. The duties of the committee include providing guidelines on implementation of the objectives and the policies of the law; setting policies to ensure the quality of education; working with the government and local administration to get funding for the education sector; making policies regarding shutting down or opening of domestic as well as international schools; and working with relevant departments and ministries on short-term and long-term educational goals. Article 7 of the Section 4 also states that the commission should not interfere with the management of institutions of higher education but only assist with policy-related issues for their development. Section 5 states that public education will be divided into primary education, vocational education and higher education. The section also talks about formal and informal education as well as self-learning education. Section 6 covers the different types of schools that include public schools, private schools, monastic schools, volunteer schools, regional schools, government-funded schools, special schools and emergency mobile schools. Section 7 is about curriculum and it states that National Education Commission has to ensure curriculums used in the country have boundaries and standards and guarantee autonomy of curriculum formations if it meets these standards. Ministry of Education will set the standards of National Education Curriculum with approval from the Commission. Schools can teach in either Burmese or English or both languages and if necessary, an ethnic language and Burmese can be used in primary education. It also mentions that in States and Regions, ethnic language and literature program can be implemented through state and regional governments starting from elementary level and upgraded step by step. Section 8 details educational duties and benefits and explain the roles of parent(s) or guardian(s) and local and regional administration. Section 9 focuses on requirements for and quality of teachers. Section 10 covers monitoring and accessing the education quality and states that in every level of education there must be a quality assessment scheme. Section 11 is on management and administrative duties of education. In Article 56 (a), it states the Ministry of Education, relevant ministries and Higher Education Committee will work together to manage related institutions of higher education based on this law and existing laws. Section 12 covers budget and Section 13, Article 66 states that existing schools before the implementation of the law must operate according to the law by five years of its enactment. Section 14 covers more general issues including that the law does not govern schools that only teach religion. Background In March 2014, Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC) drafted the National Education Bill, which went through both houses of Hluttaw on July 30, 2014. While the bill was waiting for the approval from President, students and teachers unions as well as the civil society groups raised concerns over whether the bill was drafted democratically . They claimed that even though the government held meetings to seek advice from the public, it ignored their recommendations. Thein Sein sent back the bill to the parliament with some 25 proposed changes. On September 26, the parliament accepted 19 of the proposed changes but denied 6 one of which is to delay the full implementation of the law to 2027 and it became enacted on September 30. The next step is for Hluttaw to pass by-laws in the coming months to supplement the enacted law. Controversy Opponents of the law claimed that the government didn't seek advice from the students adequately. They were also unsatisfied that minority ethnic languages would not be taught at institutes of higher education. They also stated that under the new law, universities would not be independent from Ministry of Education and most of all, they point out that the law will not recognize the formation of student and teacher unions. On the other hand, members of Hluttaw responded that institutions of higher education would remain independent from central control. Khin Maung Yi, the secretary of the Joint Bill Committee, asserted that universities would have autonomy over creating their own policies. He also accused that protesters had \\"little understanding\\" of law. Yin Yin Nwe, a member of the President Education Advisory Group, remarked that complete decentralization of education would be impossible. The advisory group also stated that government committees that would be established as mentioned in the law were not designed to control universities but just to allocate budget. The National League for Democracy, the main opposition party led by Aung San Su Kyi, was rather silent on the issue. In fact, the party distanced itself from the student protests stating explicitly that they would not follow National Network for Education Reform and did not endorse its criticism of the law (behind the student protests). Moreover, Phyo Min Thein, one the NLD's Pyithu Hluttaw Representatives, said that the current law was \\"practical\\" given the political constraints. =Main Opponents of the Law=National Network for Education Reform NNER is one of the most vocal opponents of the national education bill since its drafting stage. It is a coalition of civil society groups that include student unions, teacher unions, ethnic education groups, faith-based education groups, disabled education groups, community-based education groups, alternative education groups, education branches of political organisations, scholars and interested persons. It was formed in 2012 and had held several discussions across the country to seek opinions from the public on the current education reform process and in June 2013, it held a nationwide conference, attended by 1200 participants. During the drafting process of national education bill, NNER met with several government representatives and was even invited to meetings held in Naypyidaw. However, later it was left out from the discussion on the crafting of the bill. Student and Teacher Unions The two most eminent student unions involved in opposing the education law are All Burma Federation of Student Unions and Confederation of University Student Unions and Middle Myanmar Student Unions. These organizations are also the major force behind the student protests against the law. MTF (Myanmar Teachers Federation), a nationwide teacher union, is also one of the major opponents of the bill. It released a statement on September 15, 2014 to publicly assert their position on the issue: > We would like to announce to the people that we strongly believe that the > National Education Law will affect not only the education sector but [also] > the entire country and the people. Therefore, the Myanmar Teachers > Federation will fully cooperate with the student unions across the country > who are pushing for the education reform that will benefit the country. In the same statement, MTF also criticized the government for investigating the students' protests against the law and called for the drop of criminal charges. Student ProtestsInitial Protest: May 2014 - Sept 2014= The earliest protests against the National Education Law came even before the passage of the bill. In Mandalay Region, students at colleges and universities had held ongoing protests since May 2014. The protests were, however, postponed in early September due to upcoming exams but the students continued holding public talks to voice why they opposed the bill. Initially, protesters also linked their campaigns against the bill to the arrest of an ABFSU member, Phyu Hnin Htwe, charged for allegedly kidnapping two Chinese workers from Letpadaung Copper Mine. Government authorities also initiated criminal investigations against these protests based on the ground that they were held without prior government approval. =Emergency Student Meeting: October ‚Äì 13 Nov 2014= On 4 October 2014, three days after the law was enacted, an organizing committee was formed composed of 10 members of ABFSU and 10 members of CUSU. On 10 October, ABFSU announced that they would be holding an emergency meeting with student representatives from across the country in November. The plan was to have a two-day meeting to discuss about the National Education Law on the first day and then make plans on how to proceed on the next day. Later, the meeting was held in Yangon from November 12 to 13, which concluded with the formation of Action Committee for Democratic Education - 15-person group that consists of members of ABFSU, CUSU and MMSU - in charge of planning the four-day protest in Yangon. =The Four-Day March: Nov 14‚Äì17 2014= Students protests at Yangon University On November 14, about 350 students gathered in front of Maha Bandula Park in downtown Yangon to stage a protest against the National Education Law. The students also later held subsequent protests at Yangon University and Shwedagon Pagoda. Moreover, Kyaw Ko Ko, the chairman of ABFSU, declared that the protest was just the beginning of the fight to reform National Education Law. He also stated that the main concern against the NEL is the formation of a National Education Commission composed of ministers and government officials that could limit students' opinions and further reinforce the government control over higher education. The protest also coincided with United States President Barack Obama's second visit to Yangon although Kyaw Ko Ko claimed that it was not intentional. He added, though, that the students would be ready to seize the opportunity to raise awareness about issues on education. The Action Committee for Democratic Education then requested the government to convene a quadripartite meeting with its members, NNER, members of Parliament and the government to discuss the students' concerns. On 17 November, the students announced a 60-day interval for the government to respond to their demands and also threatened that they would stage a nationwide protests if the government didn't respond within the deadline. =60 day Ultimatum: Nov 18, 20 14‚Äì Jan 20, 2015= On November 18, a day after the students announced an ultimatum, Ministry of Education held a press conference, urging the students to attend a negotiating meeting with Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC), which drafted the legislation. At the conference, Khin San Yee, the Minister of Education, said: > I want them to negotiate freely and transparently. Every parent cannot > fulfill all of the demands of their children. So think of us like the > parents and demand and negotiate with us and we will do. But if the parents > can't afford it, the children should understand it. On November 20, President's Education Advisory Group held a meeting at the Diamond Jubilee Hall at Yangon University, to assert their stance on the current controversy over National Education Law. While acknowledging the voice of the students on the importance of decentralization of education, the group claims that there are limits to how independent universities could be. It further claims that the formation of National Education Committee is the solely on the purpose of budget allocation but not to centralize control over institutions of higher education. Zaw Htay, the Director General of Higher Education Department (Lower Myanmar) stated that negotiations were still open, after the students rejected a meeting with the ministry. He also said that students, parents and experts would be consulted in the process of crafting by-laws Shwe Mann, the speaker of Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, also agreed to accept written submissions to the parliament while EPIC also offered to serve as an intermediary. The students, however, announced that they had no intention to write submissions to the parliament because they were waiting for the quadripartite meeting. On November 26, the Action Committee for Democratic Education announced that they were planning a seminar on National Education Law in mid-December and would invite experts unaffiliated with the government or the protesters. They also had plans to stage two more protests in the upcoming week and had held three in the previous week. On November 27, about fifty students from Mandalay, Sagaing, Monywa and Myingyan staged an unauthorized protest in front of City Hall in Mandalay to reiterate their demand: to convene a quadripartite meeting. The police at first stopped the students from exiting Eaindawyar Pagoda, their initial meeting point. The students, however, convinced the police that the officers' children themselves would benefit from the protests and were able to march to the City Hall and ended their protest at Mahamuni Buddha Temple, a history significant place where 17 Burmese pro-independence leaders were killed during the colonial era. On December 1, six students were threatened to get arrested for unauthorized protests that took place on November 29. They were told that they would be arrested for a day and then be eligible to be bailed out. The police left to inform the superiors and never returned after the students told them that they would not accept the release on bail but would rather get arrested. The six accused students, also the members of ABFSU, waited at Taungoo train station until 10 pm for the police to show up but then left. On December 12, the Ministry of Education formed a teacher union consisting of two teachers from each department of Yangon University of Foreign Languages. Myanmar Teachers Federation promptly rejected the ministry's attempt to form a union stating that it violated the internationally accepted principles of freedom of association. A statement released by MTF also said that the ministry failed to recognize MTF even though Burma had agreed to adhere to 1955 International Labor convention that guaranteed the formation of union and the right to organize and despite MTF's compliance with the current Burma's labor draft law. =The 404-Mile March: Jan 16 ‚Äì Jan 31 2015= After the 60-day ultimatum to convene a quadripartite expired on Jan 16, students from far afield as Pakokku, Sagaing and Monywa set out to join the march from Mandalay to Yangon. On Jan 20, more than a hundred students left Mandalay as the march began. The students also had plans to join other student protesters on their 404-mile journey to Yangon that they were planning to finish in 15 days. They also said that they would set up a camp after arriving in Yangon to urge the government to consult with students and teachers on future amendments to the law. Immediately after the march began, President Thein Sein, announced in a state- run newspaper on Jan 21 that the parliament should reconsider some parts of the National Education Law and said that amendments would lead to stability and allow the students to resume their studies. On January 23, in a statement released by the parliament mentioned that it had agreed to consider changing the National Education Law and ordered the Ministry of Education to urgently come up with a draft that would incorporate inputs from both houses of the parliament, related government committees and commissions as well as relevant individuals. On January 24, ACDE released a statement that outlined the 11 issues that the students wanted to discuss at the quadripartite meeting: :#Inclusion of representatives of teachers and students in legislation process of education policies and laws, by-laws and other related laws, :#The right to freely establish and operate student and teacher unions and legal recognition for them, :#Establishment of National Education Commission and University Coordination Committee mentioned in the approved National Education Law :#Self-determination and self-management on educational affairs of individual state/regions and schools :#Modifying current examination and university matriculation system :#Modifying teaching methods to such that ensure freedom for thinking and self-studying of students :#Inclusion of a provision in National Education Law that ensure freedom for the practice of ethnic languages and mother tongue based multi-lingual education (MTB-MLE) for ethnic populations and tribeshttp://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/ethnic-language- teachings-decentralisation-dividend/ :#Inclusive education for all children including children with disabilities :#Resumption of enrollment for students previously expelled from schools due to the student uprisings :#Allocation of 20 percent of national budget for education :#Regulating of free compulsory education up to middle school level rather than primary level On January 28, the student representatives and the government had a meeting in Naypyidaw ‚Äì attended by ten student representatives, two members of parliament and Minister Aung Min as well as Deputy Education Minister Thant Shin. The government and the student leaders then released a joint statement announcing that they had agreed to stop the march to Yangon after the quadripartite meeting which would be held at the Diamond Jubilee Hall at Yangon University on February 1. The statement also said that 11 demand-points from the students would also be discussed at the meeting on February 1. Meanwhile, the students declared that until they met with their representatives who went to Naypyidaw for the meeting, they would still continue the march. On the other hand, the protesters in Pakokku and Dawei who were planning to join the march suspended their plans. =The Quadripartite Meetings: Feb 1‚Äì14, 2015= On February 1 as the quadripartite meeting was taking place, the NLD publicly announced that Thein Lwin, its central committee member and the chairman of National Network for Education Reform, did not represent the party or its policies. It further mentioned in the statement that the NLD could take legal action against Thein Lwin for violating party rules regarding asking permission to participate in organizations independent of the party. Han Tha Myint, a central committee member of the NLD, also stated that Aung San Suu Kyi, the chairman of the NLD, did not support Thein Lwin as his actions could be construed as representative of the party's stance on the issue. The ACDE promptly responded to that statement the next day by accusing the NLD for attempting to undermine the student protests at such a critical moment. The first quadripartite meeting ended with the students reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators. However, Aung Min, a President's Office Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president the responsibility of the students' safety until they arrived in Popa in Mandalay Region. The first three preconditions from the students ‚Äìissuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate ‚Äì were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions. Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3. On February 3, in front of Ministry of Education headquarter in Naypyidaw, the students announced that they would be resuming their nationwide protests. Earlier that day, the government declared that the second quadripartite meeting was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting. During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president. The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president's advice after a discussion. That early afternoon, the Ministry of Information released photos of government delegates standing in an empty room with a caption saying that the students did not show up to the meeting. Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12. The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south. On the same day, Aung San Su Kyi confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking Thein Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER. Initially silent on the topic, U Thein Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision. On February 4, the student demonstrators from Ayeyarwady Region have arrived near Kyaunggon after they received a welcoming reception from the town residents. About 800 people also temporarily joined the students marching from Mandalay on their way to Taungdwingyi after the leaders gave a speech at Magwe Computer University. The students also planned to stay and protest in Pakokku for three days starting February 5 before they resumed their march to Yangon. At the same time, a committee representing about 260 civil society groups released a statement urging the government to continue quadripartite meetings and to refrain from the use of violence against student protestors. On February 5, it was confirmed that students from Ayeyarwady Region and Taninthayi Region had continued marching to Yangon to join other protesters. That same day, the government announced that some political organization with intentions to destabilize the country were behind the student protests even though it did not identify them. It further urged the public to remind themselves of riots resulting in instability in the past. On February 7, Ko Ko, Minister for Home Affairs, said in the interview that some political extremists were manipulating students to use methods of confrontation and that in some cases, most of them were supported by foreign organizations. Ye Yint Kyaw, a member of the ACDE, retaliated by accusing the government of having the same mentality as the former military regime. On February 9, the NLD released a statement saying that Thein Lwin, a member of NNER, was suspended from his position in the party's central executive committee indefinitely. Another statement released by the NLD also announced the suspension of its Central Education Committee chaired by Thein Lwin. Aung San Su Kyi, the leader of the NLD, also said that it was a conflict of interest for a party member to be involved in an organization independent of the party. Thein Lwin responded by saying that he believed \\"student demands are righteous\\". The statement came out as Thein Lwin along with other education advocates and student representatives attended the third quadripartite meeting with Deputy Minister of Education and reached an agreement to resume further talks on February 11 at Yangon Region Parliamentary building. At the same time, the students marching from Mandalay were approaching Pyay in Bago Region and were about a mile away from a barricade set up by 200 riot police and 100 Swan Arr Shin members. About 300 residents from nearby towns accompanied the students to protect them due to rumors of a possible crackdown. Meanwhile, the students marching from Tanintharyi Region arrived in Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State the day before and held several demonstrations joined by the locals (thein lwin suspended). The third group leaving from Ayeyarwady Region reportedly arrived in Maubin, about 100 miles away from Yangon. In Dedaye, in the northwest of Maubin and about 56 miles from Yangon, around 400 riot police were deployed. The student protesters called for negotiations with the police in case of a potential confrontation and the police informed that they were there to provide security not to stop the protests. Moreover, the fourth group of around 300 students left Pakokku, following the path that the group from Mandalay took several weeks ago. After ten-hour long meeting on February 11, the government accepted all the demands from the students. The students and the government delegates released a joint-statement, saying that the government generally agreed on the 11 demands and that the meeting would be reconvened on February 14 to further discuss the details. The plan was to send the proposed bill to the parliament on February 16. Despite the agreement, the student protesters announced that they would continue the march since the parliament had not passed the amendments. To the students' surprise, the government released a statement on February 13 announcing that it would not allow the students to enter Yangon and that it would take measures to restore stability if the students did not halt their march. The students immediately held a meeting that evening to decide whether they should continue. The day before on February 12, the students sent a delegate to meet with Aung San Su Kyi who then told the students that it would be impossible to achieve all their demands and that was just the nature of democracy. =Post-quadripartite Meetings: Feb 15 ‚Äì March 1, 2015= As the fourth quadripartite meeting on February 14 went without any issues, the student leaders and NNER began to craft the proposed amendment bill, which they finished on February 15. and the bill was submitted to the parliament on February 16. Student groups from Ayeyarwady Region and Tanintharyi Region decided to suspend their march after hearing the result of the meeting. Student organizers also stated one of the reasons they decided to go back was because of Ashin Nyanisarra, one of the most respected monks in Myanmar, who told them to take pride in what they achieved and go back to continue their education for the future of the country. In another statement, Ashin Nyanisarra told the government to forgive the students and to accept their demands. Meanwhile, the main group of protesters from Mandalay continued to march from Minla to Letpadan in Bago Region and planned to arrive in Yangon in ten days despite announcement by the government the day before that it would be taking legal actions against the protesters if they continued their march to Yangon. On February 19, the protesters from Ayeyarwaddy Region stalled their march and set up temporary camps in Maubin and Pathein Townships as they waited for the decision from the parliament while giving public talks on the latest updates on the agreements they had with the government and the content of the proposed amendment bill. That day, Union Nationalities Alliance announced that they were in support of the student protests and donated $1000 while at the same time urging the parliament to quickly pass the amendments. Meanwhile, some 30 students from Dagon University in Yangon staged a sit-in in front of the rector's office from 9:30 am to noon after they were unknowing invited to a campus event earlier that week that condemned the student protests. The sit-in was also a response to the article featured in The Mirror, a state-owned newspaper that claimed that students had organized the event by themselves. On February 20, the main column of student protesters from Mandalay announced that they would take a break from marching until March 1 due to primary and middle school exams coming up at the end of February. The students also stated that they wanted to give time to the parliament and see how it would handle the amendment bill. On February 22, at a press conference in Yangon, the students accused the government for violating the agreements as the government submitted the Ministry of Education's version of the amendment bill alongside with the one agreed upon at the quadripartite meetings. Earlier that week on February 17, the Ministry of Education presented two proposed bills, claiming that the ministry crafted one of them. The bill that the Ministry of Education proposed, according to Thein Lwin, the chairman of NNER, was the one presented at first at the quadripartite meeting but agreed to be discarded by the government. The competing drafts in the parliament might delay the process and could take up to a month according to Phyo Min Thein, a member of parliament representing the NLD. Despite concerns from the students, the two proposed bills seemed to have some features in common. They both stated that schools and universities will be independent from the National Education Commission; that the school system would cater to students with disabilities; that the students would have the right to choose subjects they want to study except for those mandatory to pass the matriculation; that students and teachers would have the right to form unions and if necessary with financial help from university administration; that schools would be able to choose which language to teach; and that the government would increase the funding to 20% of the national budget in five years. Meanwhile, on February 24, the Amyotha Hluttaw (the Upper House) invited six major groups of stakeholders - the NNER, the ACDE, some 20 political parties, relevant members of the public, civil society groups and individuals who submitted the suggestions to the parliament - on the current issue to attend public hearings between March 5 ‚Äì 15. Later that day, the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee (SSMNC) ‚Äì a body of government- appointed monks in charge of regulating Buddhist monks in Burma ‚Äì issued a statement to the parliament publicly accusing that the proposed amendment bill that recognized unions will result in confusion between religious and political issues, leading to the demise of the roots of Theravada Buddhism . Arkar Moe Thu, a member of NNER, however, pointed out that according to Article 68(a), \\"schools that only teach religion are not governed by the law\\". Meanwhile, the students confirmed that they would continue marching on March 1, accusing the parliament for intentionally delaying the process of passing the amendment bill. On February 25, in response to the accusation from the students, Khin Maung Yi, the chairperson of Joint Bill Committee, stated that the committee was not just buying time. He also claimed that the committee was putting all necessary effort to finalize the bill in the current parliamentary session amidst other important bills such as the budget bill, the taxation bill and the national planning bill. Moreover, since the education bill is not under the category of bills that will go directly to the Union of Parliament, it has to go through the Lower House and the Upper House before it could be passed. On February 27, the students met with Shwe Mann, the Speaker of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw and the Joint Bill Committee to voice their concerns over the competing bills but they were told that the bills were already submitted to the parliament. Nanda Sit Aung, member of the ACDE, said that it was the violation of the quadripartite agreements because the bill that was submitted as the one proposed by students and the NNER was actually the one that everyone agreed at the quadripartite meeting. On March 2, as the students prepared to resume their march to Yangon from Letpadan, the police surrounded the monastery where they were staying. The students then agreed to delay their march and were joined by another group of students that pushed through a barricade of riot police. On March 3, a confrontation broke out between the student protesters and the police when a group of female students went to sit in front of the monks who were on hunger strike. The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to push through the line and came charging toward the students. The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation. Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col. Thet Htun who urged them to halt their march. The students offered a compromise and stated that they would disperse in Yangon if the minister agreed on the eight-point conditions: to march to Tharawaddy, the nearest town; to fly banners and use megaphones after they embarked on vehicles to Yangon; and to have the police forces keep a distance from them. However, they did not receive any response from the minister. On March 4, the students woke up to find that the government had reinforced the blockade with barbed wire. The riot police also stopped a group of student protesters who left [Pyay] to join the students in Letpadan. The truck the students were on was checked on its way to Letpadan and was not allowed to continue. A police officer said that they were ordered to stop the protesters and that the students should wait for the results of the negotiation scheduled for the next day. Police Lt. Col. Nanda Win also said that he wanted the issue to be resolved peacefully that did not intend to use force. =The Crackdowns: March 5 ‚Äì 10 2015= Police forcefully dispersed the protesting students in Letpadan On March 5, the student representatives boycotted the parliamentary hearings due to police blockade of the protesters in Letpadan. On that day, the protest staged right outside of Yangon City Hall to show solidarity with the student protesters in Letpadan was cracked down by the riot police and civilians with \\"duty\\" armbands. There were in total about fifty protesters and eight people were arrested - five students and three members from 88 Generation Peace and Open Society. Instead of detaining them in a police station, they were taken to the former office of Ministry of Agriculture in Yankin Township. On March 6, all eight students were released but they were charged under Article 18 of Peaceful Assembly Law for organizing unlawful protest, which could result in up to one-year prison sentence. The same morning, another five student protesters near the town market in Letpadan were arrested and the Letpadan local police also announced that 11 people present at a rally two days earlier would be charged under the same article used to arrest protesters in Yangon. There were also two rallies that day, one near the Yangon University campus and one at the entrance of Mandalay University campus to criticize the government's violent crackdown of the protests a day earlier in Yangon and to urge the government to let the students continue their march from Letpadan. On March 9, the students after going a hunger strike since March 3 announced the deadline at 10 am on March 10, asking the government to bring an end to the standoff in Letpadan and to allow them to continue marching to Yangon. On March 10, as the deadline expired, the students began to remove the barbed wire set up by the police but their attempt was futile. After their second attempt an hour later, the police declared that the protest was illegal and ordered the students to evacuate the monastery five persons at a time and not to leave Yangon in one group. The students refused and turned themselves in for peaceful arrests. The police then initiated an assault on the protesters including those inside the monastery. The exact number of injured people was not confirmed but the estimate was around 100. The police also attacked on volunteers working to escort the injured. Zar Zar Tun from Free Funeral Service Society, an organization in support of the movement from the beginning, announced that the first ambulance provided by the organization transported six men and two women one of whom suffered a severe head injury. In a statement released by the Ministry of Information, a total of 127 people ‚Äì 100 men and 27 women ‚Äì were arrested. The Myanmar Council also released a statement later that afternoon condemning the arrest of the journalists during the crackdown. At 2:30 pm on the same day, a group of students marching from Hledan junction in Yangon to downtown was also dispersed using force, minutes after the protest began. Several people were injured and initially one of the protesters was handcuffed but later released at the scene after the students plead and agreed to disband. The Letpadan crackdown received criticism from the European Union as well as the NLD, which was not in support of the current student movement. The EU that had funded about $11 million on trainings to enhance the country's police force witnessed three student crackdowns as the first phase of EU- funded training came to an end. NLD also released a statement calling for independent government investigation on the reasons behind the use of violence See also *Education in Burma *8888 Uprising *U Thant funeral crisis ReferencesFurther reading * * External links *National Education Law 2014 text *BurmaNet News Archive on Education *Updates on Student Protests Against National Education Law Category:Education in Myanmar Category:Burmese law Category:Education law Category:Protests in Myanmar ","title":"Myanmar National Education Law 2014"},{"id":"45638132","text":"Sanchai Ratiwatana and Sonchat Ratiwatana were the defending champions, but lost in the quarterfinals.

Gameplay The game primarily takes place in a sandbox environment but contains a mixture of puzzle-solving, indirect combat and exploration. The player has the ability to trap enemies, objects and other items in the game in order to take their functions and modify the creature. The functions that you collect can then be given to any other object or creature to create minions that will defend the player or help them overcome certain obstacles and puzzles. All the player's decisions will have a major impact. The game has metafictional elements. Plot In The Magic Circle, the player takes on the role of a QA tester who was recently hired to help prepare the live demo for a game that has been in development hell for nearly twenty years; said game is the sequel to a cult classic interactive fiction title with a dedicated fan following. The player is introduced to the developers of the game, who make their appearances in the world as floating eyes capable of changing the environment on a whim, only to discover that the two project leads, Ishmael Gilder and Maze Evelyn, have entered into a bitter rivalry over their respective creative philosophies, and due to their inability to cooperate have rendered the game largely vaporware. Once the playtest session is officially \\"complete\\", a rogue AI from a previous version of the game makes contact with the player and teaches them how to manipulate the creatures of the world in order to either complete or at least escape the game world. Development The development team consisted of Stephen Alexander, Kain Shin and Jordan Thomas, who had previously worked on BioShock and Dishonored. According to the game's credits sequence, the team was supported further by Steve Pardo (Harmonix) who composed the original score, and Patrick Balthrop, who was the sound engineer. The voice cast included James Urbaniak, Ashly Burch, Karen Dyer, and Stephen Russell. An early access version of the game was released on Steam in May 2015. A month later, the game was fully released. Reception The game has a score of 80 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. It was nominated for the Excellence in Narrative award at the 2016 Independent Games Festival. As of March 2016, the game only sold about 16,500 units, according to Jordan Thomas of Question, which he called \\"unsustainable\\" and attributes to not having attempted to market the game.

In 2013, Blumberg was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada \\"for her contributions to architecture and for her commitment to creating spaces that foster a sense of community.\\" Notable projects include the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) Campus, 2011 which is the recipient of the Royal Institute of British Architects International Award (2012), the Architectural Record ‚ÄúGood Design is Good Business Award‚Äù (2013) and the Governor General's Medal for Excellence (2014). Biography Blumberg was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and graduated from the University of Cape Town in 1972. She immigrated to Canada in opposition to Apartheid in her home country in 1974, after spending a year in London, England. She completed her education in Canada graduating with Honours from the University of Toronto School of Architecture in 1976. In 1977, she joined Barton Myers Associates, Inc. in Toronto and worked 10 years as an associate until Myers decided to move his office to Los Angeles. This catalyzed Blumberg to join forces with three other associates of Barton Myers ‚Äì Bruce Kuwabara, Thomas Payne and Marianne McKenna ‚Äì to form Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB), in 1987. Blumberg has focused on projects of architecture that benefit society and has directed a range of projects that speak to issues of pluralism, housing, and community building. This work includes the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre in Don Mills, Ontario and the Toronto Community Housing, Block 32 and adjacent Fort York Branch Library. Current projects include the Global Centre for Pluralism for the Aga Khan in Ottawa and the Lawrence Heights Redevelopment in Toronto. She is also the partner-in-charge of the Remai Modern Art Gallery of Saskatchewan (Mendel Art Gallery), the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Political Science and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, and 20 Washington Road for Princeton University. Blumberg is also part of the campus framework planning effort for Princeton University with Urban Strategies and Michael Van Valkenburgh and Associates. Blumberg is a member of the Toronto Community Housing Design Review Panel, and has served on the City of Toronto Design Review Panel. In 2014 Blumberg served on the design review panel for the memorial to the Victims of Communism. Proposed to be located on one of the last pieces of open land in the parliamentary district of Canada's capital, Ottawa, Blumberg voted against the design and catalyzed a protest against the initiative and the location. Shirley led the gelling of the Design Exchange, an architectural clash including the 1990s Ernst & Young Tower, 1930s Moderne machismo and a 1960s Mies van der Rohe's Toronto-Dominion Centre next door. She was partner-in-charge of this $8 million project at Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg, the architecture firm that won the job in January 1988, after beating 40 other design firms in an interview process. Her attention to detail and thought process for every part of the Design Exchange allowed her to unify these clashing architectural styles into one distinguished building. Beyond using a variety of materials, Shirley used them in virtuosic ways, saying, ‚Äúwe wanted to demonstrate their limits, to see how far we could push them.‚Äù During this project she says, \\"design isn‚Äôt just people sitting around and sketching on a drawing board. It‚Äôs a huge industry with many collaborators, from designers to fabricators to suppliers.‚Äù Some of Blumberg's public service included being a part of the seven-member jury that evaluated finalists for new Ottawa Memorial to the Victims of Communism. Her main criticism to the project was why a memorial to victims of communism was so prominent and so ‚Äúcentrally placed that it would seem to quite overshadow Canada‚Äôs true history,‚Äù as well as the memorial not being able to be built for the estimated price of $5.5 million.

R. (2004). Historic, Current, And Proposed Future Management of Sport Fish In High-Elevation Park Lakes. North Cascades National Park High Lakes Fishery Management. Within Washington state a number of lakes in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains have been stocked since the early 20th century. Prior to the existence of a state wildlife management agency, the U.S. Forest Service stocked mountain lakes with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), cutthroat trout (Oncohynchus clarki) and eastern brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). High lake management of this era largely focused on improving sport fishing opportunities and secondarily establishing ecological balance. Natural reproduction of fish species, especially eastern brook trout, has led to overpopulation and ‚Äústunting‚Äù from starvation in low nutrient environments. The result has been decreased interest from fishermen, while causing large, negative impacts on natural lake biota.Pfeifer, B. (2007). Piscivore Control of Reproducing Fish in Washington High Lakes ‚Äì Mixed Results. Inland and Alpine Fisheries. 2-45. Addressing concerns for biodiversity can positively impact agendas for the conservation of species, as well as high lakes fishery management.  Impacts on lake species via competition or predation  While not all lakes experience excessive natural reproduction, the presence of trout may be a factor in the decline of commonly found biota in these mountain lake settings. The introduced trout replace top predators in otherwise fishless lakes and alter top-down food chains.Tyler, T., W. J. Liss, L. Ganio, G. L. Larson, R. L. Hoffman, G. Lomnicky & E. A. Deimling, 1998. Interactions between introduced trout and larval salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum)in high-elevation lakes. Conservation Biology. 12: 94‚Äì105. =Salamanders= A salamander egg mass in a mountain lake with introduced trout. Studies conducted in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex examined impacts on larval stage long-toed salamanders through snorkel observations. The long-toed salamander is considered the top vertebrate predator in high-elevation fishless lakes, but the presence of fish species often equates to lower densities of larvae.Tyler, T., W. J. Liss, L. Ganio, G. L. Larson, R. L. Hoffman, G. Lomnicky & E. A. Deimling, 1998. Interactions between introduced trout and larval salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum)in high-elevation lakes. Conservation Biology. 12: 94‚Äì105. While fish impact is a notable factor, fish predation is more commonly linked to changes in salamander behavior, particularly nocturnal tendencies. As lakes decrease in elevation and Scientists have examined additional abiotic and biotic factors that lead to declines of salamanders in lake ecosystems. Elevation, water temperature, lake area and depth, as well as availability of suitable food resources, are all factors that interact with fish introductions to influence impacts. Amphibian declines have become a worldwide issue that is most commonly attributed to chemical pollution, acid rain, ozone depletion, habitat destruction, as well as introductions of exotic species Recent studies have shown correlations of decline among amphibians to a chytrid fungus, which causes chytridiomycosis. The pathogen is one of many emerging infectious diseases that largely threaten amphibian populations, especially salamanders. Primarily spread through the import/export of live animals the threat lies when infected animals escape or are released into the wild. =Copepods/Gammarus= Red copepods speckle the water in a mountain lake. Copepods are diaptomids, or crustaceous zooplankton, that are found in a wide range of sizes and lake habitats. Fish have large impacts in pelagic habitats that can alter the food chain and even eliminate certain species. Diaptomid kenai is considered a large species that is less commonly found in shallow lakes with trout reproduction. They are often red in color and are easy targets for predatory trout. Lakes with an absence of D. kenai allow smaller copepod species such as D. tymelli to exist in higher numbers. This correlation suggests predation of large copepods on smaller copepod species. In lakes that are deeper and have limited trout reproduction cohabitation has been observed with an overall reduced body size for D.kenai. The presence of Gammarus, a predatory amphipod, also dictates levels within the food chain. [Weidman 2011]. Non-native trout, salamander larvae, or Gammarus will step into the role of top pelagic predator when others above it are absent. Similarly D. kenai will become top predator with the absence of a larger predator in the water column. These dynamic interactions also depend on a variety of abiotic factor, which provide suitable habitat conditions for both the copepod and Gammarus species. =Birds and Aquatic Insects= Impacts from fish are also felt outside of their lake habitat. A study in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California observed correlations of trout to reductions in mayflies as a food source for Rosy-Finches. The introduced trout had a cross- boundary effect on an avian competitor. The fish outcompeted the finches for emerging aquatic insects, causing a total reduction of 98% fewer mayflies than emerge from fishless lakes. The lakes without fish were much more productive, with 5.9 times more finches present feeding on the emerging insects. The mayfly is a food source most often utilized by the finches to feed their young, so dramatic decreases in mayfly stocks could have potentially negative impacts on fledgling success rates.  High lake fish management  Given evidence of diverse impacts from trout populations, a debate exists around decisions to continue to stock mountain lakes with trout fry. Each lake represents a unique ecosystem that holds different management challenges. Plans exist which precisely lay out past mistakes and future plans for a reorganization of priorities in lake management. In many cases efforts are successful, but some lakes are still strongly affected by fish overpopulation.Downen, M. R. (2004). Historic, Current, And Proposed Future Management of Sport Fish In High-Elevation Park Lakes. North Cascades National Park High Lakes Fishery Management. Other cases favor the elimination of fish entirely as there may be potential negative downstream impacts on native fish's genetic purity and rehabilitation efforts, especially bull trout.Pfeifer, B. (2007). Piscivore Control of Reproducing Fish in Washington High Lakes ‚Äì Mixed Results. Inland and Alpine Fisheries. 2-45. =Frogs= A small frog found in a once stocked, now fish-less lake. While concerns exist within the western United States and Canada, amphibian studies are conducted around the world to assess the impacts of trout. Eastern brook trout have negatively affected the presence and breeding success of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italian Alps). The exposed lakes above tree line offered few hiding places for adults, tadpoles and egg masses. Eastern brook trout were found to survive in such environments at ‚Äúdepressed growth rates‚Äù, similar to the patterns of overstocking found in the United States. To reestablish the suitability of alpine lakes as breeding sites for Rana temporaria, complete eradication of fish is proposed. Lower elevation lakes, however feature greater habitat complexity and allow opportunity for stable populations of both frog and fish. =Introduction of piscivorous fish species= Efforts have been made in Idaho and Washington to assist in controlling stunted, overpopulated lakes by introducing known piscivorous fish species such as the brown trout, lake trout, and tiger muskellunge. Studies conducted in Idaho primarily focused on the tiger muskellunge and have been successful in low complexity habitats. The presence of these fish has drastically reduced brook trout populations, increasing average length and weight of remaining fish.Koenig, M. (2012). Project 4: Hatchery Trout Evaluations. IDFG Annual Performance Report, 9-101. Similarly, biologists in Washington have adopted the implementation of tiger muskellunge and are still studying the impacts of these fish. Historically, efforts in Washington have been made that seek similar results. Both brown trout and lake trout were introduced into various lakes within the Washington Cascades and monitoring took place over a 20-year span. While minimal improvements were noted with brown trout introductions, the largest success came from lake trout introductions. While the tiger muskellunge were stocked at a length of nearly 11 inches, the brown and lake trout were stocked as fingerlings and results did not become evident until up to 12 years later. For shorter-term elimination efforts the introduction of fish at a larger size is likely to achieve desired performance.Pfeifer, B. (2007). Piscivore Control of Reproducing Fish in Washington High Lakes ‚Äì Mixed Results. Inland and Alpine Fisheries. 2-45. =Gill netting= This approach is often seen a short term, temporary effort. The act of gill netting a lake requires extensive time and labor and is not a reliable removal method. One study reportedly eliminated eastern brook trout from a 2.5 ha lake after 10,000 net-nights.Pfeifer, B. (2007). Piscivore Control of Reproducing Fish in Washington High Lakes ‚Äì Mixed Results. Inland and Alpine Fisheries. 2-45. Effectiveness is lost with large, deep lakes or lakes with a complex shoreline filled with woody debris.Downen, M. R. (2004). Historic, Current, And Proposed Future Management of Sport Fish In High-Elevation Park Lakes. North Cascades National Park High Lakes Fishery Management. =Piscicides= Two of the traditionally used piscidies in lake management are rotenone and antimycin. Chemical applications are often looked down upon from a public standpoint, as there are negative connotations with poisoning an otherwise pristine environment and the killing of non-target organisms.Koenig, M. (2012). Project 4: Hatchery Trout Evaluations. IDFG Annual Performance Report, 9-101. When piscides are used, antimycin is often the preferred choice as there is little impact on lake invertebrates and its toxicity naturally subsides before reaching fish populations downstream.Pfeifer, B. (2007). Piscivore Control of Reproducing Fish in Washington High Lakes ‚Äì Mixed Results. Inland and Alpine Fisheries. 2-45. Rotenone detoxifies at a slower rate and has adverse effects on the entire lake community. Both are expensive and there is difficulty in application because of remoteness.Koenig, M. (2012). Project 4: Hatchery Trout Evaluations. IDFG Annual Performance Report, 9-101. =Compromise ‚Äì low density stocking= Low density stocking practices reduce impact on biota and improve quality of fishing. Many practices in fish management that took place in the early 20th century serve as lessons and reminders that careful attention must be paid to fragile lake ecosystems.Downen, M. R. (2004). Historic, Current, And Proposed Future Management of Sport Fish In High- Elevation Park Lakes. North Cascades National Park High Lakes Fishery Management. As debate continues over biodiversity in mountain lakes there will likely be a compromise required for success. One approach is low-density fish stocking. This requires baseline surveys that assess a lake's abiotic and biotic factors before stocking any trout species.Downen, M. R. (2004). Historic, Current, And Proposed Future Management of Sport Fish In High- Elevation Park Lakes. North Cascades National Park High Lakes Fishery Management. Likewise, with reduced numbers of trout going into lakes there is less environmental impact and greater opportunity for recreational fishing. Fish grow to greater sizes due to lack of competition for food and there are not enough fish present to negatively impact biota. Additional efforts are being made to avoid easily reproducing species of trout, as well as stocking sterile triploid fish. By introducing species that do not reproduce the fish are of the same age class and will eventually die, therefore allowing biota to recover. Reproducing fish put continual pressure on the biota of the lake.Pfeifer, B. (2007). Piscivore Control of Reproducing Fish in Washington High Lakes ‚Äì Mixed Results. Inland and Alpine Fisheries. 2-45. Overall the debate continues as lake management plans vary on a case to case basis and require reevaluation as species populations fluctuate.

The game has been available in early access for Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows since October 2015 and has yet to be scheduled for release.  Plot  Noct plays in a post-apocalyptic world, in which the Earth has become a ruined wasteland. Filled with darkness, it is now known as the Noct. An ancient evil, called the Nocturnal, has spread over the Earth's surface, devouring the human population and leaving the survivors of that purge at distress. One unnamed survivor is now set to uncover the origins of alien-like creatures and fight their way through to put an end to the unhuman rulership. To get there, the survivor has to make themselves up to seek for weaponry, food and water to stay alive and be prepared to encounter and fight against the Nocturnal, ultimately surviving in a decaying world.  Gameplay  In Noct, the protagonist, an unnamed survivor, can be seen through a thermal imaging satellite, and can only be controlled from that perspective. As the player moves the character through the wasteland, they will receive messages from the overwatch, who are responsible for the active satellite, which give the player certain quests to perform to track down the Nocturnal's origin. In a total of four acts, the player is set to complete these quests as a primary objective, while they also have to find food, water and weaponry, which were hidden inside buildings during the invasion. All weapons in the game only feature a minimal magazine, while the player is also not able to carry more than three external magazines to reload the weapon. If the player ever runs out ammo, they have to rely on melee combat until they find another weapon or ammo crate. At random times, the player encounters one of the Nocturnal monsters, foreshadowing it with the protagonist releasing a slight \\"uh oh!\\" upon them coming nearer. In case the player is inside a building, they are unable to see anything outside the room they are standing in. The only thing visible for the player are the doors of that building, which open and close if a Nocturnal enters one, so that the player can evaluate if it is safe to leave the room they are in. Once the player dies, you can see the overwatch switch to a new survivor, leading him to the previous survivor's corpse to retrieve the items already gathered and continue their quest. In online multiplayer, the player eventually meets up with others, and they have to decide quick if they are working together or try to murder each other to gain each other's weapons and ammo.  Development  Noct was crowdfunded through the website Kickstarter, where developer Chris Eskins sought to raise , starting in August 2014. The game was successfully funded on 19 September 2014 and finally ended on 24 September 2014 with a total of pledged. Noct was greenlit for release on the platform Steam through its Steam Greenlight on 26 September 2014. A prototype of the game was playable at PAX South 2015. In September 2015, it was announced that Noct would be released on 22 October that year. Noct was released on 21 October into Steam's early access programme, with a full release planned for January 2016.

Course Davis Hollow looking downstream Davis Hollow begins in a valley in Benton Township. It flows southwest for a short distance before turning west for several tenths of a mile, crossing Pied Piper Road. The stream then turns southwest for a few tenths of a mile, leaving the valley and entering a plain. It then turns southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 487 after several tenths of a mile. At this point, it turns south-southwest and reaches its confluence with Fishing Creek a short distance further downstream. Davis Hollow joins Fishing Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Davis Hollow is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. There are two patches of alluvium, which contains stratified silt, sand, and gravel, near the upper reaches of Davis Hollow. However, the surficial geology in the area mainly consists of bedrock made of sandstone and shale as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Lag is present at the top of the valley.

It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 327 in its catalogues. Plot According to a surviving catalogue description of the film: Production The film, probably made in the late summer of 1900, satirizes the allied coalition (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Russia) that was then staging military interventions in China, shortly before the Boxer Rebellion. (The rebellion itself is not mentioned in the surviving description of the film, and probably postdates it.) By 1900, M√©li√®s had already filmed numerous \\"reconstructed newsreels\\" (staged reenactments of current events) relating to war topics. China Against Allied Powers, though similarly topical, took a different stylistic route, representing the conflict symbolically. M√©li√®s, whose films often side with the underdog (as is evidenced, for instance, in his film series The Dreyfus Affair), reveals a pro-China stance in this film; this was a highly unusual position among European filmmakers, and indeed no other known film made at the time about the Chinese conflict portrays China sympathetically. The film is currently presumed lost. Related films The American film The Congress of Nations, directed by J. Stuart Blackton of Vitagraph Studios for the Edison Manufacturing Company and copyrighted in September 1900, has a very similar plot, and may have been modeled on M√©li√®s's film. Blackton's film, made in collaboration with the English magician and filmmaker Albert E. Smith and featuring Smith onscreen, survives as a paper print. Blackton and Smith also borrowed the dissolve technique used in the film from M√©li√®s, who had pioneered it in his successful 1899 film Cinderella. The magician in the Blackton version, having produced flags and personifications of the nations involved, allows his Allied soldiers to attack a nonmilitary \\"Chinese\\" character (actually a Vitagraph clerk, Morris Brenner) for a few moments before replacing the conflict with a huge American flag and a patriotic tableau.

Primarily a painter, she also works with a number of other media and techniques.  Biography  Agn√®s Thurnauer was born in 1962, in Paris, France, where she continues to live and work. She attended the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Arts D√©coratifs, where she studied cinema and video art.  Notable work  Big-Big et Bang-Bang (1995‚Äî1996) = Big-Big et Bang-Bang are a series of abstract acrylic paintings in subtle colour tones on canvas created by Thurnauer between 1995 and 1996. The works were created with the canvases stapled to the wall. The paintings were only mounted on frames when complete, for the purposes of display and preservation. left = Portraits grandeur nature (2007‚Äî2009) = In 2007, Thurnauer first exhibited her work Portraits grandeur nature, a series of oversized buttons (each 120 cm in diameter) in resin and epoxy paint displaying the names of well-known artists, mostly male, transformed into names evoking the opposite gender. For example, Marcel Duchamp becomes Marcelle Duchamp and Andy Warhol becomes Annie Warhol. An exception is the button reading Louis Bourgeois, a masculinized version of the name of the artist Louise Bourgeois. This work, which questions both the literal and figurative representation of women in art, propelled her to previously unattained notoriety as an artist.left = Pr√©delles (2007‚Äî2011) = Beginning in 2007, Thurnauer produced a series of works, called Pr√©delle (the French term for predella). The Grande Pr√©delle incarnations, produced from 2008-2011, are diptychs, each depicting a large feathered wing along a deformation of the iconic title of the magazine Elle. The title and subject convey a multiple play on words, simultaneously acting as a homonym for \\"pr√®s d'elle\\" and \\"aile\\", respectively meaning \\"close to her\\" and \\"wing\\" in French. Cyclicly, each Grande Pr√©delle painting has its own palette glued to it as a finishing touch. Olympia #2 (2012) = Olympia #2 (2012) = In 2013, Thurnauer was invited by Yale University to participate in an exhibition celebrating the 150th anniversary of two masterpieces by √âdouard Manet (Olympia and Le D√©jeuner sur l'Herbe, 1863). Thurnauer contributed the painting Olympia#2, which features a rendition of Manet's Olympia with textual terms of endearment superimposed upon the image. Thurnauer was also a speaker at the associated conference. = You (2012‚Äî2013) = During a period of two months in 2015, Jesus College at the University of Cambridge replaced three portraits of male alumni in the formal dining hall with a crayon drawing triptych by Thurnauer, called You. These large portraits of women are extractions from paintings by Manet: A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re, The Railway (of painter Victorine Louise Meurent), and another portrait of Meurent. Central to Thurnauer's choice of Manet's work as a starting point is the notion that his female subjects were themselves painters, as opposed to models. Inevitably, the subjects' regards captured in the paintings are therefore those of Manet's professional peers looking upon him as he worked. This marked the first time that Thurnauer's work was shown in the United Kingdom.Matrice/sol (2012) = Matrice/sol (2012) = The work Matrice/sol consists of moulds of letters of the alphabet made from resin. Through the characters created from the negative space of the moulds, the work is intended to demonstrate that art is a question of interpretation and language, elements that change constantly.  Painting as a medium  Thurnauer continues to challenge the relevance of the medium of painting today, which remains her staple despite ventures into other methods. For Thurnauer, a painting is not simply a passive surface displaying an image. Rather, it is a means to an active experience for the viewer. She has stated that she is interested in working with paint, an ordinary, inanimate object, as a means of confronting one's intemporality.  Relationship with language  Thurnauer has long been fascinated with language, as evidenced by the recurring theme of wordplay, text and symbols in her work. She has been considered as a distant successor to the Art & Language movement. Thurnauer considers the medium of painting to be a ‚Äúplace of speech\\". Her interpretation of this idea transcends the physical appearance of text in paintings, implying the materialization of thought itself. In her sculpture, Matrice/Sol, she employs letters moulded from resin, not merely as literal tools, but as spatial delimiters whose interstices form an expanse within which one can circulate.

Several of her studies and paintings were made of her daughters. Chatsworth House, which descended through her daughter Charlotte, holds a collection of 24 of her works of art. Boyle had a great interest in the arts and was a patron of David Garrick and George Frideric Handel. She was one of Queen Caroline's Ladies of the Bedchamber. Savile Row, developed at the edge of the Boyle's Burlington House estate, was named after her (based on her surname, Savile). BiographyEarly life= Dorothy Boyle (n√©e Savile) was born to William Savile, 2nd Marquess of Halifax and his second wife Mary Finch, whose father was Daniel Finch, 7th Earl of Winchilsea. Boyle was a co-heiress of her father's estate. Boyle's two brothers both died when they were young. She had a sister, Mary, who wed Sackville, Earl of Thanet. Boyle also had a half-sister, Anne (married to the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury), from her father's first marriage to Elizabeth Grimston, daughter of Sir Samuel Grimston. =Marriage and children= William Aikman, Rt. Hon. Richard Boyle and Lady Dorothy Savile, 1723, Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston, Lancashire Dorothy Boyle married Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington on 21 March 1721 and brought a substantial dowry and a shared interest of theatre and music to the marriage. She enjoyed the opera, music, and theatre and was a patron of the arts, including David Garrick and George Frideric Handel. Her favorite writer was John Gay. Soon after their marriage, Boyle began modernising Chiswick House and its grounds. They also lived at Londesborough, East Riding of Yorkshire and in London at Burlington House. Lady Charlotte Boyle (1731‚Äì1754), Later Marchioness of Hartington, National Trust, Hardwick Hall. Boyle had three daughters: Dorothy (1724‚Äì1742), Julianna (1727‚Äì1730), and Charlotte (1731‚Äì1754). Jean-Baptiste van Loo painted a family portrait of Dorothy Boyle, her husband, and three daughters in 1739. The painting is currently located in Lismore Castle's Devonshire Collection. In 1741, Boyle's eldest daughter, Dorothy, married the Earl of Euston, and died of smallpox just before her eighteenth birthday in 1742. Her youngest daughter, Charlotte, married William, Marquess of Hartington, on 28 March 1748. Charlotte passed down her mother's artwork and correspondence to her descendants. =Death= The Countess of Burlington died on 21 September 1758, aged 59. =Ancestry=Artist Dorothy Savile, Portrait of Lady Charlotte Boyle, Marchioness of Hartington (1731‚Äì1754), circa 1740, Chatsworth House. Attributed to Dorothy Savile Boyle studied how to draw and paint portraits with pastels with William Kent and made copies of good portraits to develop her talent. Kent, who lived with Savile and Boyle for 30 years, studied painting in Rome and in addition to being an artist, he was a designer and landscape gardener. Kent and Boyle made portraits of each other and George Vertue commented that Boyle's painting of Kent was \\"much more like than that done by Aikman\\". By the mid-1720s she had also studied with Joseph Goupy. During that time she advanced from pastels to oil painting. According to Neil Jeffares and the British Museum, she may have had lessons from Charles Jervas, the King's portrait painter. Lady Boyle was a talented caricaturist and made good, though rapid, portraits. Horace Walpole said of Boyle, \\"She drew in crayons, and succeeded admirably in likenesses; but working with too much rapidity did not do justice to her genius. She had an uncommon talent too for caricatura.\\" Boyle made a portrait of daughter Dorothy from memory seven weeks after her daughter's death. Of the paintings at Chatsworth, the \\"new house\\" at Chiswick, 24 of the works were created by Boyle. Mrs. Selwyn, Lady Isabella Finch, and Lady Fitzwalter were among the friends to have received eight of Boyle's pastels that are now among the Chatsworth collection. The works in the collection include three oil paintings and pastel studies of her daughters and an oil painting of Princess Amelia. Her sketch, Woman at Harpsichord, with a Dog and a Cat, reveals an intimate scene where the woman plays a tune for her own pleasure. She made a sketch of her friend Alexander Pope in his grotto and enjoyed making caricatures. He wrote five quatrains about her entitled On the Countess of B‚Äî‚Äî cutting paper.  Queen Caroline  Boyle was one of Queen Caroline's Ladies of the Bedchamber. She was appointed to the post in 1727 at the same time as Mary, the Countess of Pembroke. On her appointment Lord Hervey said her manner was like 'a cringing House-Maid.' Philanthropy Boyle was one of the signatories to Thomas Coram's 1735 petition to King George II calling for the foundation of the Foundling Hospital. She signed the petition on 19 May on the same day as the Countess of Cardigan. The petition was initially unsuccessful, but Dorothy influenced her husband, Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, who in 1739 became involved in the creation of the Foundling Hospital and became a governor of the charity.Ladies of Quality and Distinction exhibition programme, edited by Kathleen Palmer, published by The Foundling Museum, 2018; Foundling Hospital Archive: The paper of the Foundling Hospital from 1731 to the late twentieth century at the London Metropolitan Archives. Alongside her husband, Richard Boyle, Boyle was a patron of the arts, taking a supporting interest in both David Garrick and George Frideric Handel. Garrick and Boyle were correspondents and a letter survives in the Folger Library collection from Garrick to Boyle from October 1750. Additionally the celebrated dancer Eva Marie Veigel (also known as Violette) lived with Boyle at her home Burlington House when she first came over to England in 1746. Garrick fell in love with the young dancer and in 1749 they wed. Boyle was initially against the match but was later persuaded to support the marriage. Savile Row A view of Burlington House in the 1690s, forming the centrepiece of the Burlington Estate. Boyle drew up plans for a new street for townhouses. The Daily Post reported on 12 March 1733 that new buildings were about to be built on Savile Street in Mayfair, London. The Burlington Estate project was named after Lady Dorothy Boyle's maiden name, Savile. Savile Row was built by 1735 on freehold land known as Ten Acres belonging to a merchant tailor, William Maddox, By the late 18th century, it was a center for high-quality tailor shops.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in July 2016, and for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2016. Plot The game's plot involves an archmage named Abraxis and his efforts in a secret underground tomb to practice magic far from civilization. The player takes on the role of various adventurers who have arrived at this strange, otherworldly Necropolis with unknown motivations‚Äîloot, glory, and exile all give way to the need for escape. Gameplay Necropolis is a third person action role-playing game. The game is set in a labyrinth in an abstract dimension and features moving platforms and hidden treasure. Players are able to alter parts of the world by solving puzzles. Enemies include dead adventurers, wild animals, and abandoned machinery. Abraxis' servant, the Brazen Head, assists in shaping the environments and assigning tasks, which both constantly change. Combat consists of timed attacks and attack patterns, relying heavily on movement and placement of the player character without access to a shield or dodge ability. Items such as potion ingredients and books are collectible. As in most \\"rogue- lite\\" games, death results in a permanent loss of items and progress, and requires the player to begin a new save file. There are certain cosmetic items that can be purchased with in-game currency on various levels, but these can only be applied to the player character at the creation of a new save file. The player can have only one active save file. The collectible books allow certain equipped effects on the player character. These can be applied at the end of each level, before descending to the next. These abilities range from higher jump, to higher money and item drop rates. As of the latest update, there are two playable adventurer classes: the Blackguard (speed), and the Brute (strength). Development The game was featured at PAX 2015, where it was named Destructoid's Editor's Choice winner. It was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on July 12, 2016, and was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 4, 2016. Music The game's soundtrack was composed by Jon Everist, who had worked with Harebrained Schemes in the past with the Shadowrun series. Hardcore Gamer stated that Everist's score was \\"incredible\\", which providing several \\"haunting, orchestral yet minimalistic themes that perfectly fit the mood without ever overshadowing things\\". Reception The PC version of the game received an aggregate score of 59 composed from 34 critics on Metacritic.

Logic blocks can be configured by the engineer to provide reconfigurable logic gates. Logic blocks are the most common FPGA architecture, and are usually laid out within a logic block array. Logic blocks require I/O pads (to interface with external signals), and routing channels (to interconnect logic blocks). Programmable logic blocks were invented by David W. Page and LuVerne R. Peterson, and defined within their 1985 patents.Google Patent Search, \\"Re- programmable PLA\\". Filed January 11, 1983. Granted April 2, 1985. Retrieved February 5, 2009.Google Patent Search, \\"Dynamic data re-programmable PLA\\". Filed January 11, 1983. Granted June 18, 1985. Retrieved February 5, 2009. Applications An application circuit must be mapped into an FPGA with adequate resources. While the number of logic blocks and I/Os required is easily determined from the design, the number of routing tracks needed may vary considerably even among designs with the same amount of logic. For example, a crossbar switch requires much more routing than a systolic array with the same gate count. Since unused routing tracks increase the cost (and decrease the performance) of the part without providing any benefit, FPGA manufacturers try to provide just enough tracks so that most designs that will fit in terms of Lookup tables (LUTs) and I/Os can be routed. This is determined by estimates such as those derived from Rent's rule or by experiments with existing designs. FPGAs are also widely used for systems validation including pre-silicon validation, post-silicon validation, and firmware development. This allows chip companies to validate their design before the chip is produced in the factory, reducing the time-to-market. Architecture Simplified example illustration of a logic cell In general, a logic block consists of a few logical cells (called ALM, LE, Slice etc.). A typical cell consists of a 4-input LUT, a Full adder (FA) and a D-type flip- flop, as shown to the right. The LUTs are in this figure split into two 3-input LUTs. In normal mode those are combined into a 4-input LUT through the left mux. In arithmetic mode, their outputs are fed to the FA. The selection of mode is programmed into the middle multiplexer. The output can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the programming of the mux to the right, in the figure example. In practice, entire or parts of the FA are put as functions into the LUTs in order to save space.http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/cyc2/cyc2_cii51002.pdfhttp://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug070.pdf Logic blocks typically contain a few ALMs/LEs/Slices. ALMs and Slices usually contain 2 or 4 structures similar to the example figure, with some shared signals. In recent years, manufacturers have started moving to 6-input LUTs in their high performance parts, claiming increased performance.http://www.origin.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp245.pdf =3D Architecture= To shrink the size and power consumption of FPGAs, vendors such as Tabula and Xilinx have introduced new 3D or stacked architectures.Dean Takahashi, VentureBeat. \\"Intel connection helped chip startup Tabula raise $108M.\\" May 2, 2011.

The multi-die construction also allows different parts of the FPGA to be created with different process technologies, as the process requirements are different between the FPGA fabric itself and the very high speed 28 Gbit/s serial transceivers. An FPGA built in this way is called a heterogeneous FPGA.http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp380_Stacked_Silicon_Interconnect_Technology.pdf External I/O Logic block pin locations Since clock signals (and often other high-fan-out signals) are normally routed via special-purpose dedicated routing networks (i.e. global buffers) in commercial FPGAs, they and other signals are separately managed. For this example architecture, the locations of the FPGA logic block pins are shown to the right. Each input is accessible from one side of the logic block, while the output pin can connect to routing wires in both the channel to the right and the channel below the logic block. Each logic block output pin can connect to any of the wiring segments in the channels adjacent to it. Similarly, an I/O pad can connect to any one of the wiring segments in the channel adjacent to it. For example, an I/O pad at the top of the chip can connect to any of the W wires (where W is the channel width) in the horizontal channel immediately below it. Routing Generally, the FPGA routing is unsegmented. That is, each wiring segment spans only one logic block before it terminates in a switch box. By turning on some of the programmable switches within a switch box, longer paths can be constructed. For higher speed interconnect, some FPGA architectures use longer routing lines that span multiple logic blocks. Switch box topology Whenever a vertical and a horizontal channel intersect, there is a switch box. In this architecture, when a wire enters a switch box, there are three programmable switches that allow it to connect to three other wires in adjacent channel segments. The pattern, or topology, of switches used in this architecture is the planar or domain-based switch box topology. In this switch box topology, a wire in track number one connects only to wires in track number one in adjacent channel segments, wires in track number 2 connect only to other wires in track number 2 and so on. The figure on the right illustrates the connections in a switch box. Generally, all the routing channels have the same width (number of wires). Multiple I/O pads may fit into the height of one row or the width of one column in the array. Hard blocks Modern FPGA families expand upon the above capabilities to include higher level functionality fixed into the silicon. Having these common functions embedded into the silicon reduces the area required and gives those functions increased speed compared to building them from primitives. Examples of these include multipliers, generic DSP blocks, embedded processors, high speed I/O logic and embedded memories. Higher-end FPGAs can contain high speed multi-gigabit transceivers and hard IP cores such as processor cores, Ethernet MACs, PCI/PCI Express controllers, and external memory controllers. These cores exist alongside the programmable fabric, but they are built out of transistors instead of LUTs so they have ASIC level performance and power consumption while not consuming a significant amount of fabric resources, leaving more of the fabric free for the application-specific logic. The multi-gigabit transceivers also contain high performance analog input and output circuitry along with high-speed serializers and deserializers, components which cannot be built out of LUTs. Higher-level PHY layer functionality such as line coding may or may not be implemented alongside the serializers and deserializers in hard logic, depending on the FPGA. Clock signals Most of the circuitry built inside of an FPGA is synchronous circuitry that requires a clock signal. FPGAs contain dedicated global and regional routing networks for clock and reset so they can be delivered with minimal skew. Also, FPGAs generally contain analog PLL and/or DLL components to synthesize new clock frequencies as well as attenuate jitter. Complex designs can use multiple clocks with different frequency and phase relationships, each forming separate clock domains. These clock signals can be generated locally by an oscillator or they can be recovered from a high speed serial data stream. Care must be taken when building clock domain crossing circuitry to avoid metastability. FPGAs generally contain block RAMs that are capable of working as dual port RAMs with different clocks, aiding in the construction of building FIFOs and dual port buffers that connect differing clock domains.

A parish was assigned out of St Luke's Church, Bristol Street, Birmingham in 1866. The church was the scene of a suffragette protest in 1914 during the visit of the Bishop when a woman called out for the Bishop to pray for Margaret Haley and all suffragette prisoners. She was ejected from the church. Just before his sermon, the Bishop was interrupted by three other suffragettes who called for him to speak out against the torture. As the suffragettes left the church, they had to be protected by the police against an indignant crowd. The church closed in 1947 and has been demolished.

Early history The history of Salem can be traced back to 1835, when Joseph Harrison, minister of Ebenezer, Trecynon broke away from that church because he was prepared to administer baptism by total immersion to those who wished. This was contrary to the beliefs of Independent church members. Meetings were initially held in houses and later in the long room of the White Lion Inn. Although this was disapproved of by a number of members who were teetotal it was far from unusual for the chapels of the valley to have their early origins in meetings in public houses. This difficulty was initially addressed by building a wooden hut in 1836 which was known as Ty Planca. Soon it became too small and the congregation proceed to build Salem in 1841, at a cost of ¬£550, and on land leased from Dr James Lewis Roberts. Joseph Harrison was minister until his death in 1851. The Ministry of Joshua Thomas Harrison was succeeded by Joshua Thomas. He served as minister for many years and was presented with a testimonial of ¬£140 in April 1875. The gift was presented by John Harrison, the oldest deacon and son of the founder of the chapel. Speakers on this occasion included Michael D. Jones of Bala, Thomas Rees of Swansea and local ministers William Edwards of Ebenezer, Trecynon and William Williams of Nebo, Hirwaun. During this period members from Salem established Bethel, Gadlys. Membership reached 65 in 1841 but by the following year had fallen to 25. Salem remained open until the twenty-first century.

Invisibility is a special case of illusion optics, which turns objects into illusions of free space. The concept and numerical proof of illusion optics was proposed in 2009 based on transformation optics in the field of metamaterials.Lai, Y.; Ng, J.; Chen, H. Y.; Han, D. Z.; Xiao, J. J.; Zhang, Z. Q.; Chan, C. T. (2009). \\"Illusion Optics: The Optical Transformation of an Object into Another Object\\". Physical Review Letters 102 (25): 253902. . . It is a scientific disproof of the idiom 'Seeing is Believing'.Pendry, J. (2009). \\"Optics: All smoke and metamaterials\\". Nature 460: 579. . Illusion optics proves that the optical responses or properties of a space containing any objects can be changed to be exactly those of a virtual space but containing arbitrary virtual objects (illusions) by using a passive illusion optics device composed of materials or metamaterials with specific parameters and shape. For example, a dielectric spoon was numerically shown to exhibit the scattering properties of a metallic cup by using an illusion optics device in the seminal paper. Such illusion effects do not rely on the direction and form of incident waves. However, due to dispersion limitation of specific material parameters, the functionality of illusion optics device only works in a narrow band of frequency. Difference with optical illusions Unlike optical illusions that utilize the misinterpretation of the human brain to create illusionary perception different from the physical measurement, illusion optics changes the optical response or properties of objects. Illusion optic devices make these changes happen. Although both these terms deal with illusions, Illusion optics deal with the refraction and reflection of light, whereas while optical illusions are basically mind tricks. History Illusion optics was recorded in 1968 when Soviet physicist Victor Veselago discovered that he can make objects appear in different areas through negatively refracting flat slab. When light is negatively refracted, the light is directed towards the direction it entered and deflected away from the line of refraction. Normal refraction occurs when light passes through the line of refraction. Veselago used this theory to work the slab into a lens, which he recorded in his experiments. He discovered that unlike a normal lens, the objects resolution does not depend on the limits of the wavelengths passing through the lens. Veselago's work has been more prominent in recent years due to the advancement in metamaterials, which are engineered materials that have special internal physical properties and have the ability to negatively refract light. Devices An illusion device is how illusion optics works‚Äîwithout a device there is no way to define how light is refracted and deflected. Based on a study on circular objects with illusion optic properties, (i.e. negative refraction indexes) there are three basics of an illusion device: the invisibility cloak, real object, and illusion object.Cojocaru, E. (2010). Illusion Devices with Internal or External Circular Objects Designed by the Coordinate Transformation Method. Journal of Electromagnetic Waves & Applications, 24(16), 2309-2317. The invisibility cloak is basically the medium on which light waves refract. Invisibility cloaks allow for an object to be undetected while confined in the area of the cloak. In other words, the viewer does not see the real object. In illusion optics, devices are not limited to only invisibility cloaks. For example, in Veselago's experiments, and lens was used to steer eyes away from the real object and direct them towards the illusion object. The real object refers to any object that is being refracted upon. In this case, while the real object is under the invisibility cloak, light waves are directed around it so the viewer only sees past the cloak. In Veselago's experiments, the real object is being refracted so the viewer sees a mirrored view of it. The illusion object is how the light waves come together and produces what the viewer sees as ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù The invisibility cloak refracts the reflected background light around the object and directs it into the viewer. The viewer only perceives there to be a background. With Veselago's experiments, the illusion object is displayed, but is only an image and is not the real object. Metamaterials Artificial metamaterials are important to how illusion optic devices are created. The properties of these materials allow it to bend light waves negatively, so as to have negative permittivity and negative permeability.Wei Xiang, J., Hui Feng, M., Qiang, C., & Tie Jun, C. (2010). Illusion media: Generating virtual objects using realizable metamaterials. Applied Physics Letters, 96(12), 121910. There are two pieces of metamaterials which hold different properties: the complementary medium and the restoring medium. The complementary medium is the illusion media used to scatter wavelengths away from the object that is being refracted. The restoring medium focuses waves and directs scattered waves together. Transformation optics is an important to creating metamaterials. The intermolecular geometry used in this field is crucial to creating the material properties.

It was founded in 1939 and has been running as a non- profit organisation since 1954. The club houses around 10,00 books, and has published 18 new titles since 1942. Publications The general purpose of the Club is to promote interest in the printed word and, from time to time, publish such books, pamphlets and other forms of printing which reflect member interest. Since its first publication in 1942, the Club has published eighteen books, including two incunabulum leaf books and scores of special publications and keepsakes printed by Club members. In its issue of scholarly and popular material, the Club's publications rank as fine printing and at least four of them have received national recognition for outstanding graphics achievements. Its publications, all in limited editions, are regarded as collector's items, and its earlier publications are scarce and demand high prices in bookstores. Most club publications are out of print. The Club also publishes a quarterly newsletter. An archive of Club publications, keepsakes, and meeting minutes is at the California State Library. The club's collection includes the translations of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg, Friedrich Paul Wilhelm, letters written by Alonzo Delano to the San Francisco Free Trader in the early 1850s in reference to the gold rush and English translations of Th√©ophile de Rutt√©, an early 19th-century settler in San Francisco who was one of the last people to write about the city before a series of fires between 1849 and 1851. Meetings The Club meets on the second Friday of the month from September through June, with a summer break in July and August. Meetings, always well attended, are generally held in area community centers or libraries. A program, usually a noted guest speaker who is often also a Club member, precedes refreshments and a short business session. Officers are elected at the annual meeting in January, which also includes a very popular 'show and tell' feature when members bring their special andfavorite collections of books and book art treasures to the meeting and share their interests. Printer members of the Club also print a limited number of beautiful letterpress keepsakes for the occasion. The February meeting celebrates the founding of the club. It is a dinner meeting and features an especially distinguished speaker. Other programs during the year feature authors, publishers, experts on printing, book collecting, California history and the books arts. A potluck supper meeting in June closes the season until regular meetings resume in September. During July and August a tour or outing to a local library, archive or other point of interest may be arranged. Membership Membership in the Club is open to anyone interested in books. This might include printing, the book arts, books as collectibles, the history of books, libraries, or the use of the printed word. Members receive monthly meeting notices and a popular quarterly newsletter. Special interests of members vary widely. Collections include Sacramento and California history, Western. Americana, mining, railroading, California medical history, drama, classics in literature, first editions, miniature books, popup books, bookplates, printing, bookbinding, engraving, paper making, typography, illuminated manuscripts, cartography, children's books, science fiction, aviation, and more. Collectors of fine printing own works from such presses as the Allen, Kelmscott, Doves, Grabhorn, and Yolla Bolly Presses, to name a few. Authors whose works are collected include Ansel Adams, Gertrude Atherton, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Jack London, Henry Miller, John Muir, Edgar Allan Poe, Beatrix Potter, Robert Louis Stevenson, John Steinbeck, William Morris, Jack Kerouac, Gertrude Stein, Mark Twain, Henry David Thoreau, Robert Nathan, Willa Cather, L.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle for the churches in Galatia, written between AD 49‚Äì58. This chapter contains a discussion about circumcision and the allegory of the \\"Fruit of the Holy Spirit\\".  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 26 verses. =Old Testament references= *Galatians 5:14: Verse 1 New King James Version :Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. NKJV New Revised Standard Version :For freedom Christ has set us free. :Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. NKJV The Greek of the verse's first part is considered awkward, that among many possibilities, it is suggested to be a conclusion of the Hagar-Sarah allegory or a short independent bridging paragraph between the allegory and the new themes in the chapters 5 and 6. Neither Circumcision Nor Uncircumcision (5:2‚Äì12) These verses bring up the central theme which is mentioned in chapter 2 about the chasm between \\"being justified by the law\\" and \\"living by faith through the Spirit\\", in this case a theme that is related to circumcision. Living by the Spirit (5:13‚Äì26) Image with words from Galatians 5:14 (Rob Hille; 2013). In this section Paul contrasts \\"living by the Spirit\\" with \\"gratifying the desires of the flesh\\", which are two opposing ways of living. =Verse 14= :For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: \\"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\\" NKJV Using the citation from Paul speaks positively about the law which is \\"fulfilled\\" in the coming of Christ. Works of the Flesh Paul lists the works of the flesh (verses 19‚Äì21) as the behaviors that would prevent individuals from inheriting the kingdom of God. English Standard Version The lists or catalogues of vices (and also lists of virtues such the one in Galatians 5:22-23) were a form of ethical instruction very common in the Greco-Roman world. Fruit of the Holy Spirit Stained glass rose window depicting the Lord as Good Shepherd along with the \\"Fruit of the Spirit\\" (Galatians 5:22-23), Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, Ireland. *\\"The fruit of the Spirit\\": the Ethiopian version reads \\"...of the Holy Spirit\\". Referring to the \\"internal principle of grace\\", called the Spirit (), and the graces of which are called \\"fruit\\", not \\"works\\" (which refers to the actions of the flesh). It is in the form of a \\"list of virtues\\", which has no comparable juxtaposition lists in the contemporary writings; the closest parallel in the New Testament is perhaps . *\\"Love\\" (, ): may be understood as \\"love to God\\", and also \\"love to Christ\\", which the teaches people to love the neighbors; furthermore, \\"love to the house and worship of God\\", to the truths and ordinances of the Gospel. *\\"Joy\\" (, ): which is in the Holy Spirit, has him for its author and the object of it is God, as a covenant God and Father in Christ. Moreover, joy in the good of others, of fellow creatures. *\\"Peace\\" (, ): refers to the peace produced through the application of the blood of Christ for pardon, and for justification to the sinner's soul, to yield the peace, quietness, and tranquillity of mind. It is also be the peace with all others, under a work of the God's Spirit of God, to live peaceably with all people. *\\"Longsuffering\\" (, ) and \\"kindness\\" (, ): instead of a \\"patient waiting\\" for good things or more grace or glory to come, it is a \\"patient bearing and enduring\\", through the Spirit, of the present evils with gladness; being slow to anger, ready to forgive mistakes, and bear with as well as forbear one another, accompanied with gentleness, humanity, affability, courteousness, in words, gestures, and actions, to be an imitation of the gentleness of Christ. *\\"Goodness\\"(, ): acts of goodness to men, in a natural, civil, moral, spiritual, and evangelic manner, for the benefit both of soul and body, and is well pleasing to God when performed in the exercise of the grace. *\\"Faith\\" or \\"faithfulness\\" (, ): Fidelity, both in words and in deeds, is very significant in the Gospel, and a profession of belief. Faith in Christ is a gift of God, and the work of his Spirit, leading a person into believing in Christ for salvation, and making a \\"profession of faith\\".. *\\"Meekness\\" or \\"gentleness\\" (, ): refers to humility (\\"lowliness of mind\\") which is patterned after Christ and transcribed by the Holy Spirit from Christ into the heart of a regenerate person; thus, walking humbly with God, acknowledging as well as being thankful for every blessing, and depending on his grace, while behaving with modesty and humility among people. *\\"Temperance or self-control\\" (, ) or \\"continence\\": refers to \\"chastity and sobriety\\", such as moderation in eating and drinking. * \\"Against such there is no law\\": The listed virtues are perfectly agreeable to the law of God.

Biography Macnamara was the eldest of the four children born to Francis Macnamara, (1884-1946), an eccentric Irish poet and sometime landowner, and his wife Mary Yvonne Majolier, (1886-1973), who was from a family with both Anglo-Irish and French roots. In 1916 Francis Macnamara left his family to follow various political and cultural adventures, including an attempt to establish a 'Republic of Macnamaraland'. His family were left impoverished and they had to move home several times. They stayed in France with the Majolier family for a time and in 1923 they settled at Blashford in the New Forest. Blashford was close to Freyn Court, the large property in Fordingbridge where Augustus John, Dorelia McNeill and an extended group of their friends and family were living the bohemian life. The Macnamara children moved freely between the two households and although Nicolette received little formal education, and did not learn to read until she was twelve, she did gain both an appreciation of art, from the artists at Freyn Court, and also a love of nature, particularly ornithology, from exploring the New Forest. Her only formal education were brief stints at schools in Cannes and Paris, where she had some formal art classes. Augustus John used his influence, and money, to enable Macnamara to enter the Slade School of Fine Art when she was sixteen. Her fellow students included William Coldstream, Rodrigo Moynihan and Anthony Devas, whom she married in 1931. Macnamara did well at the Slade and throughout the 1930s began establishing her career as an artist with works shown at the New English Art Club, the Royal Academy and the London Group. Shortly before the beginning of World War Two she had a one-woman show at the Storran Gallery. After the war Macnamara decided to concentrate on writing fiction. Her first novel, Bonfire was recommended for publication by Cecil Day Lewis and when it was eventually published, in 1958, it sold well and received good reviews including one by John Betjeman in the Daily Telegraph. Her most successful book was her autobiographical account of her unorthodox childhood, Two Flamboyant Fathers, which focused on both Augustus John and her own father. For several years Macnamara worked studying and sorting birds' eggs at the Natural History Museum. Anthony Devas died in 1958 and several years later Macnamara married Rupert Shephard, an artist and contemporary of hers from the Slade who was also a widower with three children. The couple set up home in Chelsea in a house which quickly became a social hub for many artists. Macnamara became an active member of both English PEN and PEN International and was a regular speaker at their events and conferences. In 1987 Macnamara's artwork featured in an exhibition of works by former Slade students held at Sally Hunter Fine Art. Macnamara's younger sister, Caitlin, married the poet Dylan Thomas.

It acts as a phosphomonoesterase at low pHs. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of Lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) to their respective monoacylglycerols and the release a free phosphate group in the process. The enzyme has higher activity for myristate-LPA (14 carbon chain), oleate-LPA (18 carbon chain and one unsaturated carbon-carbon bond), laurate-LPA (12 carbon chain) or palmitate-LPA (16 carbon chain). When the substrate is stearate-LPA (18 carbon chain), the enzyme has reduced activity. Phosphatidic acids can also be hydrolyzed by lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase, but at a significantly lower rate. The addition of the second fatty chain makes fitting into the active site much harder. LPAs are necessary for healthy cell growth, survival and pro-angiogenic factors for both in vivo and in vitro cells. Unbalanced concentrations of lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase can frequently lead to unbalanced LPA concentrations, which can cause metabolic disorders, and lead to ovarian cancer in women.  Structure  Space-filling model of lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase depicting the filled solvent channel. Image generated from 4JOC.; Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase is a monomer composed of two domains. One domain functions as a cap on the enzyme, while the second comprises the body of the enzyme. The enzyme has two (Œ±) alpha helices on one side, seven (Œ≤) beta sheets in the middle, and two more Œ± helices on the opposite side. The space between the two domains serves as a large substrate pocket, as well as a channel through which water molecules can move through. This channel is lined with hydrophilic residues that lead the water molecule to the active site, where the terminal water molecule interacts with Asp-335 residue and is then activated. This catalyzes the bond formation to the phosphate group. Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase also has two disulfide bridges. One that binds Œ±12 and Œ±4 together, and the other that binds a turn at the edge of Œ≤7 strand. Analysis of the pocket shows that the active site pocket has space for one long fatty acid chain, but not for two fatty chains, furthermore supporting that this enzyme has strong preference for LPAs.The active site of the enzyme shows the polar contacts between the residues in the pocket and the substrate. Image generated from 4JOC. The active site of lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase has six main residues required to stabilize the phosphate group and the hydroxyl. These residues are Arg-58, His-59, Arg-62, Arg-168, His-334, Asp-335. Though there are no crystal structures with a LPA molecule in the substrate pocket, the crystal structure with malonate shows the hydrogen bonding between the enzyme residues and the carbonyl groups that would stabilize the phosphate and hydroxyl groups on the LPA. In the active site, the phosphate group is stabilized by Arg-58, Arg-62, Arg-168 and His-334. The guanidinium groups and hydrogen on the protonated imidazole ring from the histidine residue. When any of these residues were mutated to alanine, the catalytic activity of the enzyme was greatly reduced. This is evidence that the active site requires this \\"claw\\" to hold on to the phosphate group, the aspartic acid residue to activate a water molecule, and the histidine residue to provide a proton to form the alcohol. When the residues at the entrance to the water channel were mutated to bulkier residues, such as Leucine, Phenylalanine or Tryptophan, the enzyme was no longer capable of hydrolyzing the LPA. This further supports the proposed mechanism in which water, supplied from the solvent through the channel, acts as a nucleophile in the active site.  Mechanism  Proposed Mechanism for the Hydrolysis of LPAs by Lysophosphatidic Acid Phosphatase Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase has a very similar reaction mechanism to those of other phosphomonoesterases. One significant difference is this enzymes ability to perform the desired hydrolysis most effectively at low pHs. At low pHs, all the arginines and histidines are found in their protonated states. This ensures that Arg58, Arg62, Arg168 and His334 will be able to stabilize the phosphate group and hydroxyl group in the active site. The aspartic acid side chain has a pKa of approximately 4. In an acidic environment, this residue will readily give up its proton, but will also take a proton away from water if the side chain is deprotonized, thus catalyzing the hydroxyl attack on the phosphate group. Soon after the deprotonation of the histidine residue and the protonation of the aspartic acid residue, the histidine residue will deprotonate the aspartic acid residue, preparing the enzyme to hydrolyze an LPA again.  Function  Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase has several roles. Although lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase is found ubiquitously throughout the body with higher levels in the kidney, heart, small intestine, muscles and the liver, evidence suggests that this enzyme is regulates lipid metabolism in the mitochondria. Another function is to control the concentration of LPAs that serve as messengers for G protein- coupled receptors in the cell. These LPAs are responsible for the signaling of cell growth, proliferation, muscle contractions, and wound healing, among many other roles. Due to this role, an imbalance in the concentrations of lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase can frequently lead to several metabolic diseases. Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase is also responsible for the digestion of lysophosphatidic acids when the cell enters a state of phosphate starvation. These enzymes break down LPAs and release phosphate groups. This stops the production of phospholipids and phosphatidic acids to signal the end of a cell's proliferation process.  Disease relevance  Two examples of disorders caused by irregular LPA levels and show increased enzyme activity are ovarian cancer and Gaucher's Disease. = Ovarian cancer = Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase activity is used to detect and to quantify irregular levels of LPAs on a cell's surface. LPAs are receptor-active mediators that promote cell motility, cell growth and cell survival. There is clear evidence that cancerous ovarian cells have an increased level of LPA concentrations on their cell surfaces. These LPAs leak from the cell surface into the blood stream. The high levels of LPAs in the blood are used as tumor markers. In these cell clusters, lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase activity is higher than it is in regular cells. This can be attributed to the significantly increased levels of LPA that are secreted and synthesized by the ovarian cancer cells. This helps explain the cancerous cell's radical behavior and uncontrollable proliferation caused by the imbalance of enzyme and substrate concentrations, therefore leading to the inability to turn off the LPA cascade signalling effectively. One possible way to address and treat ovarian cancer cell proliferation would be to increase the concentration of lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase on the cell's surface, thus decreasing the amount of LPAs available to signal the cell to proceed with its radical behavior. = Gaucher's Disease = Gaucher's Disease is another disorder in which lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase is found in irregular concentrations. Increased concentration levels of lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase and enzyme activity in a patient's blood are used in order to aid in the diagnosis of Gaucher's Disease. The increased activity can be attributed to the excess of LPAs in the serum. Gaucher's Disease is caused by an accumulation of glucosphingolipids in the body tissues and bone marrow. LPAs are a precursor of sphingolipids, so although lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase is not directly responsible for the imbalance that leads to Gaucher's Disease, its activity can be used to support the diagnosis of the disease. It is important to note that even though the increased activity of the enzyme has been found in patients with Gaucher's Disease, there has been no clear relation between the enzyme and the progression of the disease.

In May 1795 the Navy returned her to privateer service. captured her in December 1796 and the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Musette. She never went to sea again and the Navy sold her in 1806. Capture On 21 December 1796 Hazard captured Musette about 30 leagues west of Cape Clear. She had taken two vessels, one of which was the Abbey, of Liverpool. Abbey had been sailing from Lisbon to Liverpool when Musette captured her. However, Daphne had recaptured Abbey and brought her in. Commander Alexander Ruddach, captain of Hazard, described Musette as a \\"fine coppered French Ship Privateer\\". HMS Musette Musette arrived at Plymouth on 31 January 1797 and was laid up. From 1798 the Royal Navy used her as a receiving ship, but did not fit her out as such until November 1801. She was hulked that year. Between September and October 1803 the Navy had Musette fitted out as a floating battery for service on the River Yealm. Lieutenant John Bevan commissioned Musette in November 1803. Lieutenant Dundas replaced Bevan in December 1804. In December 1805 the transport Beaver wrecked on the rocks of Yealm Point, with the loss by drowning of four people.

Nonetheless, this part holds the summary and \\"the hermeneutical key to the whole letter\\",According to Betz, H. D. (1979) Galatians: A Commentary on Paul's Letter to the Churches in Galatia, Hermeneia (Philadelphia: Fortress), as cited in Stanton 2007, p. 1164 consisting some key points already discussed previously, but here are emphasized again, such as the topic of 'the new creation' with abolished distinction between the circumcised and uncircumcised.

History Makthaverskan began in 2008 with the release of both a mini CD with a collection of demos and their debut self-titled album, released by Luxury Records. According to vocalist Maja Milner, the name Makthaverskan has no real meaning. She stated that \\"The band name just came from Hugo‚Äôs friend who made it up, and we thought it sounded cool, so we took it. The meaning is really hard to describe in English, but it‚Äôs the female form of someone with a lot of power. 'Makthavare,' is the male version, so 'makthaverskan' is the female version.\\" She also went on to state that, \\"We didn‚Äôt have any background thoughts about meaning, but I think it describes Irma and me pretty well, since we both take charge and are powerful\\". In 2011, the band released a single titled Antabus. Two years later, the band released both a 7\\" single titled Something More and their second full-length album, titled Makthaverskan II.

Most events of the final stage were held in Moscow, with Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Vilnius, Kaunas, Tallinn and Riga also hosting some events. Early stages The Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR was a mass participation event, with millions of people taking part in competitions associated with it; the early stages consisted of minor qualification meets on the club, local and regional levels, with the best athletes representing their republics in the final stage. The cities of Moscow and Leningrad also fielded teams, with equal status to the republics. Final stage The final stage of the 1979 Spartakiad served as a preparatory meet for the Summer Olympics of the following year, with many of the same venues being used. For the first time in the history of the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR, non-Soviet athletes were invited to take part; the final stage featured 2,306 international athletes from 84 nations, as well as 8,338 Soviet athletes. More countries participated in the Spartakiad than in the following year's Olympics, due to the US-led boycott of the latter in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the United States did not boycott the Spartakiad (as the USSR had not yet invaded Afghanistan at the time), although there were some objections in the country to the Soviet non-invitation of athletes from Israel and Egypt. Many of the non-Soviet teams were comparatively weak, and the vast majority of gold medals were won by Soviet athletes. Some world-class international athletes did take part, however; Miruts Yifter of Ethiopia won gold in both the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres, a feat he duplicated at the Olympics the following year. Although most events were open to international participation, a number of sports were still limited to Soviet athletes only.
