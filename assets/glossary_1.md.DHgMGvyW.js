The word is also used as a count noun: a taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, is a particular categorisation. The word finds its roots in the Greek language , taxis (meaning 'order', 'arrangement') and , nomos ('law' or 'science'). Originally, taxonomy referred only to the categorisation of organisms or a particular categorisation of organisms. In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a categorisation of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a categorisation. Taxonomy is different from meronomy, which is dealing with the categorisation of parts of a whole. Many taxonomies have a hierarchical structure, but this is not a requirement. Taxonomy uses taxonomic units, known as \\"taxa\\" (singular \\"taxon\\"). Applications Wikipedia categories illustrate a taxonomy,Zirn, Cäcilia, Vivi Nastase and Michael Strube. 2008. \\"Distinguishing Between Instances and Classes in the Wikipedia Taxonomy\\" (video lecture). 5th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2008). and a full taxonomy of Wikipedia categories can be extracted by automatic means.S.

Proc. of the 22nd Conference on the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, pp. 1440-1445. , it has been shown that a manually-constructed taxonomy, such as that of computational lexicons like WordNet, can be used to improve and restructure the Wikipedia category taxonomy.S. Ponzetto, R. Navigli. 2009. \\"Large-Scale Taxonomy Mapping for Restructuring and Integrating Wikipedia\\". Proc. of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2009), Pasadena, California, pp. 2083-2088. In a broader sense, taxonomy also applies to relationship schemes other than parent-child hierarchies, such as network structures. Taxonomies may then include a single child with multi-parents, for example, \\"Car\\" might appear with both parents \\"Vehicle\\" and \\"Steel Mechanisms\\"; to some however, this merely means that 'car' is a part of several different taxonomies.Jackson, Joab. \\"Taxonomy's not just design, it's an art,\\" Government Computer News (Washington, D.C.). September 2, 2004. A taxonomy might also simply be organization of kinds of things into groups, or an alphabetical list; here, however, the term vocabulary is more appropriate. In current usage within knowledge management, taxonomies are considered narrower than ontologies since ontologies apply a larger variety of relation types.Suryanto, Hendra and Paul Compton. \\"Learning classification taxonomies from a classification knowledge based system.\\" University of Karlsruhe; \\"Defining 'Taxonomy',\\" Straights Knowledge website. Mathematically, a hierarchical taxonomy is a tree structure of classifications for a given set of objects. It is also named containment hierarchy. At the top of this structure is a single classification, the root node, that applies to all objects. Nodes below this root are more specific classifications that apply to subsets of the total set of classified objects. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the general to the more specific. By contrast, in the context of legal terminology, an open-ended contextual taxonomy is employed—a taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context. In scenarios taken from the legal domain, a formal account of the open-texture of legal terms is modeled, which suggests varying notions of the \\"core\\" and \\"penumbra\\" of the meanings of a concept. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the specific to the more general.Grossi, Davide, Frank Dignum and John-Jules Charles Meyer. (2005). \\"Contextual Taxonomies\\" in Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems, pp. 33-51. History Anthropologists have observed that taxonomies are generally embedded in local cultural and social systems, and serve various social functions. Perhaps the most well-known and influential study of folk taxonomies is Émile Durkheim's The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. A more recent treatment of folk taxonomies (including the results of several decades of empirical research) and the discussion of their relation to the scientific taxonomy can be found in Scott Atran's Cognitive Foundations of Natural History. Folk taxonomies of organisms have been found in large part to agree with scientific classification, at least for the larger and more obvious species, which means that it is not the case that folk taxonomies are based purely on utilitarian characteristics. p. 9 In the seventeenth century the German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, following the work of the thirteenth-century Majorcan philosopher Ramon Llull on his Ars generalis ultima, a system for procedurally generating concepts by combining a fixed set of ideas, sought to develop an alphabet of human thought. Leibniz intended his characteristica universalis to be an \\"algebra\\" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. The concept of creating such a \\"universal language\\" was frequently examined in the 17th century, also notably by the English philosopher John Wilkins in his work An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (1668), from which the classification scheme in Roget's Thesaurus ultimately derives. Use of taxonomies in various disciplines = Taxonomies in software engineering = Vegas et al. make a compelling case to advance the knowledge in the field of software engineering through the use of taxonomies. Similarly, Ore et al. provide a systematic methodology to approach taxonomy building in software engineering related topics.  Software testing taxonomies  Several taxonomies have been proposed in software testing research to classify techniques, tools, concepts and artifacts. The following are some example taxonomies: # A taxonomy of model-based testing techniques # A taxonomy of static-code analysis tools Engström et al. suggest and evaluate the use of a taxonomy to bridge the communication between researchers and practitioners engaged in the area of software testing. They have also developed a web-based tool to facilitate and encourage the use of the taxonomy. The tool and its source code are available for public use. = Taxonomies in research publishing = Citing inadequacies with current practices in listing authors of papers in medical research journals, Drummond Rennie and co-authors called in a 1997 article in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association for > a radical conceptual and systematic change, to reflect the realities of > multiple authorship and to buttress accountability. We propose dropping the > outmoded notion of author in favor of the more useful and realistic one of > contributor. Since 2012, several major academic and scientific publishing bodies have mounted Project CRediT to develop a controlled vocabulary of contributor roles. Known as CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy), this is an example of a flat, non-hierarchical taxonomy; however, it does include an optional, broad classification of the degree of contribution: lead, equal or supporting. Amy Brand and co-authors summarise their intended outcome as: > Identifying specific contributions to published research will lead to > appropriate credit, fewer author disputes, and fewer disincentives to > collaboration and the sharing of data and code. As of mid-2018, this taxonomy apparently restricts its scope to research outputs, specifically journal articles; however, it does rather unusually \\"hope to … support identification of peer reviewers\\". (As such, it has not yet defined terms for such roles as editor or author of a chapter in a book of research results.) Version 1, established by the first Working Group in the (northern) autumn of 2014, identifies 14 specific contributor roles using the following defined terms: *Conceptualization *Methodology *Software *Validation *Formal Analysis *Investigation *Resources *Data curation *Writing – Original Draft *Writing – Review & Editing *Visualization *Supervision *Project Administration *Funding acquisition Reception has been mixed, with several major publishers and journals planning to have implemented CRediT by the end of 2018, whilst almost as many aren't persuaded of the need or value of using it. For example, > The National Academy of Sciences has created a TACS (Transparency in Author > Contributions in Science) webpage to list the journals that commit to > setting authorship standards, defining responsibilities for corresponding > authors, requiring ORCID iDs, and adopting the CRediT taxonomy. The same webpage has a table listing 21 journals (or families of journals), of which: * 5 have, or by end 2018 will have, implemented CRediT, * 6 require an author contribution statement and suggest using CRediT, * 8 don't use CRediT, of which 3 give reasons for not doing so, and * 2 are uninformative. The taxonomy is an open standard conforming to the OpenStand principles, and is published under a Creative Commons licence. = Taxonomy for the web = Websites with a well designed taxonomy or hierarchy are easily understood by users, due to the possibility of users developing a mental model of the site structure.  Guidelines for writing taxonomy for the web  * Mutually exclusive categories can be beneficial. If categories appear several places, it's called cross-listing or polyhierarchical. The hierarchy will lose its value if cross-listing appears too often. Cross-listing often appears when working with ambiguous categories that fits more than one place. * Having a balance between breadth and depth in the taxonomy is beneficial. Too many options (breadth), will overload the users by giving them too many choices. At the same time having a too narrow structure, with more than two or three levels to click-through, will make users frustrated and might give up.  Is-a and has-a relationships, and hyponymy  Two of the predominant types of relationships in knowledge-representation systems are predication and the universally quantified conditional. Predication relationships express the notion that an individual entity is an example of a certain type (for example, John is a bachelor), while universally quantified conditionals express the notion that a type is a subtype of another type (for example, \\"A dog is a mammal\\", which means the same as \\"All dogs are mammals\\").Ronald J. Brachman; What IS-A is and isn't. An Analysis of Taxonomic Links in Semantic Networks. IEEE Computer, 16 (10); October 1983. Taxonomies are often represented as is-a hierarchies where each level is more specific (in mathematical language \\"a subset of\\") the level above it. For example, a basic biology taxonomy would have concepts such as mammal, which is a subset of animal, and dogs and cats, which are subsets of mammal. This kind of taxonomy is called an is-a model because the specific objects are considered as instances of a concept. For example, Fido is-an instance of the concept dog and Fluffy is-a cat. In linguistics, is-a relations are called hyponymy. Words that describe categories are called hypernyms and words that are examples of categories are hyponyms. In the simple biology example, dog is a hypernym and Fido is one of its hyponyms. A word can be both a hyponym and a hypernym. For example, dog is a hyponym of mammal and also a hypernym of Fido.

In the 2006 Lebanon War he was commanding officer in the defence of Maroun ar-Ras and Bint Jbeil. The heavy Israeli casualties and lack of progress of its army in these two battles is widely seen as the main cause of the Israeli failure in the war. Early history Bazzi was born in the town of Bint Jbeil in South Lebanon. He joined Hizbullah as a teenager, and fought against the Israelis during the 1985-2000 South Lebanon conflict in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. During the 2006 Lebanon War he was sector commander in the Bint Jbeil area, comprising the towns of Bint Jbeil and Aynata and the villages of Maroun ar-Ras and Aytaroun. He personally participated in both the Battle of Maroun al-Ras and the Battle of Bint Jbeil. He was killed in an Israeli drone strike during the Battle of Bint Jbeil, and was one of the most senior Hizbullah commanders to die in the war. Khalid Bazzi was thirteen years old in 1982, when his hometown was occupied by Israel for the third time in his lifetime. Bint Jbeil was occupied in Operation Cauldron 4 Extended in 1972 and Operation Litani in 1978. This time the Israelis would stay 18 years. The Shiite population of Southern Lebanon had suffered hard during the years of fighting between the Palestinians and Israelis. Many residents of South Lebanon felt an initial relief after the Palestinian guerrillas where pushed back from the area. This feeling soon turned sour when it became clear that the Israelis were there to stay. An armed resistance developed, this time among the Shiite population of South Lebanon that constituted the majority population in the area. Bazzi thus grew up under the Israeli occupation. Some of his relatives had previously been active in the Palestinian Fatah movement. Bazzi and his friends soon became sympathetic or even active in the emerging Islamic Resistance. In 1985 Israel withdrew from most of south Lebanon but continued to control a security zone, comprising about 10 per cent of the area of Lebanon. The IDF launched purges in the Shiite villages remaining under occupation, arresting people suspected of being involved in the resistance. Several of Bazzi’s friends were arrested and taken to the notorious al-Khiyyam prison camp. Bazzi himself fled his home one night and slipped out of the security zone. He went to Beirut and started studying at the university. He soon dropped out of school and became a full-time activist in the resistance. During his more than 20 years of resistance activity he participated in many operations, such as the famous Bra'shit operation in 1987. Fighters from the Islamic Resistance stormed and conquered an outpost belonging to the South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the security zone. A number of its defenders were killed or taken prisoner and the Hizbullah flag was raised on top of it. A Sherman tank was blown up and a M113 Armored Personal Carrier was captured and driven triumphantly all the way to Beirut.Blanford, Nicholas, Warriors of God - Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel, Random House, New York, 2011, pp. 85-86 Bazzi was involved in the planting of deadly road side bombs, such as in Houla, Markaba and al-Abbad in the 1990s. He took part in the attempted killing of Brig. Gen. Eli Amitai, the head of the Israel Defense Forces liaison unit in southern Lebanon and thus the effective commander of the security zone. December 14, 1996, Amitai was injured when the IDF convoy he was travelling in was ambushed in the eastern sector of the security zone. Less than a week later Amitai was again injured when Hizbullah unleashed a mortar barrage on an SLA position near Bra'shit he was visiting together with Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine, head of the IDF's Northern Command. He also took part in the assassination of several high-ranking South Lebanon Army (SLA) officers, whom Hizbullah considered traitors, including as Aql Hashem, the SLA Second-in Command, who was killed by a remote-controlled bomb in January 2000.Blanford, pp. 243-244 The pursuit and assassination of Hashim was documented step by step, and the footage was broadcast on Hizbullah TV channel al-Manar. The operation and the way it was presented in media dealt a devastating blow to the morale in the SLA.Harb, Zahera, Channels of Resistance in Lebanon - Liberation Propaganda, Hizbullah and the Media, I.B. Tauris, London-New York, 2011, pp.214-216 After liberation 2000 Israeli withdrawal from the security zone in the spring of 2000 precipitated a virtual collapse of the Israel-controlled South Lebanon Army. On May 26, 2000 Hizbullah General-Secretary Hassan Nasrallah held his famous victory speech in Bint Jbeil, where he compared the power of Israel to that of a spider's web.Noe, Nicholas, Voice of Hizbullah, the statements of Sayed Hassan Nasrallah, Verso, London and New York, 2007, pp. 232-43 Nasrallah's speech infuriated many Israeli officers. This anger explains to a large extent why Bint Jbeil was targeted in 2006. After the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, Khalid Bazzi returned to Bint Jbeil and continued his involvement with military activities. He was made responsible for \\"capturing\\" operations. He took part in the Ghajar raid in 2005, when four Hizbullah fighters were killed in a failed attempt to abduct an Israeli soldier. Bazzi organized 2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid, in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two were abducted. This triggered the 2006 Lebanon War. After abduction of the two soldiers, Bazzi returned to his post as Chief of Operations in the Bint Jbeil area, comprising the towns of Bint Jbeil and Aynata and the villages of Maroun ar-Ras and Aytaroun. He commanded a force of approximately 140 fighters, spread out in the area. Bazzi participated in the Battle of Maroun al-Ras. The Israeli army eventually conquered most of the village after 10 days of fighting. The Hizbullah defenders eventually withdrew causing heavy casualties to the Israelis, including two IDF officers and six other soldiers killed. Due to Bazzi's reluctance to use two-way radios, contact was lost with him several times during the battle and at one time it was feared that he had been killed. He emerged however unscathed and continued to lead the defense from Bint Jbeil. According to Hizbullah only seven of the 17 defenders of Maroun ar-Ras were killed in that battle. On July 23, the Israeli army launched Operation Webs of Steel 2 which was designed as a pincer movement, attacking Bint Jbeil simultaneously from the east and the west. The aim was to conquer the town and purge it of Hizbullah fighters and infrastructure. Israel failed to occupy the town and suffered heavy casualties. After several days of fighting the Israeli forces unexpectedly withdrew. Bint Jbeil was however largely destroyed by intensive bombardment from the Israeli air force and artillery. On July 29 Bazzi was killed in an Israeli drone strike on a house in the Old Town of Bint Jbeil. The house collapsed, killing him, as well as fellow Hizbullah commander Sayyid Abu Taam and a third fighter. Their bodies could not be retrieved until several days after the cease-fire. There are suggestions that Bazzi earlier had refused to obey orders to withdraw from the town saying that he would \\"only leave as a martyr\\". Hizbullah commanders who spoke to Lebanese al-Akhbar a year after the war did not confirm this version of events. According to them the proper place for a commander was with the fighters on the battlefield. Bazzi and Abu Taam however were criticized for violating military regulations by being at the same place during a battle. Bazzi was succeeded as sector commander by Muhammad Qanso (Sajid ad-Duwayyir), a Special Force commander who himself would be killed in an Israeli airstrike 10 days later. The Israeli army made a second attempt to capture Bint Jbeil August 6–8, which was no more successful than the first.  Legacy  The battles led by Khalid Bazzi were considered the most crucial in the Lebanon War of 2006. First Maroun ar-Ras and later Bint Jbeil was attacked by four Israeli elite divisions, while it was only defended by a company-sized force (100-140 men) of mainly local militia. Yet, the IDF failed to conquer the town, in spite of suffering heavy casualties in repeated attempts. The Israeli leaders primarily responsible for the conduct of the war, Prime minister Olmert, Defense minister Peretz and Chief of Staff Halutz, were all in agreement in their testimony to the Winograd Commission. The 2006 Lebanon War would have been a \\"clear achievement for Israel had the initial limited ground operations in Maroun ar-Ras and Bint Jbeil been successful\\". Hizbullah is a very secretive organization and members in the military wing are always kept anonymous. Apart from Bazzi’s friends, relatives and neighbours, few Lebanese would have heard of his name before the war of 2006. To his associates in the resistance movement he was known as al- Hajj Qasim, the nom de guerre or \\"organizational name\\" () that members of the Islamic Resistance use inside the movement. Only with his death did his identity become widely known in Lebanon. Hizbullah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah noted in an interview with New TV shortly after the war (August 27, 2006) that none of the first or second level of the party officials had martyred but that three third level leaders had died in the war. Among them was \\"an operations officer in the Bint Jbeil axis\\". Although not mentioned by name, this was an obvious reference to Bazzi.Noe, Nicholas, Voice of Hezbollah, the statements of Sayed Hassan Nasrallah, Verso, London and New York, 2007, p. 398-99 On the first anniversary of his death in 2007, Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar revealed that Bazzi both took part in the cross-border operation and that he died as commander in the battle of Bint Jbeil. Surprisingly, Israel seemed long to have been unaware of both Bazzi's death and of the significant role he played both in the abduction of the two Israeli soldiers and in the defence of Bint Jbeil. When a captured Hizbullah fighter, who participated in the abduction operation, told his captors that he was commissioned his tasks by \\"al-Hajj Qasim\\" (Bazzi's nom de guerre), his interrogators only responded: \\"which Qasim?\\". Israeli newspapers did not acknowledge his existence before 2013. In July 2013 Haaretz reported that Hizbullah \\"for the first time\\" revealed the identity of Khalid Bazzi as the commander of the abduction unit and that he was subsequently killed in the war. Khalid Bazzi was buried in the Martyrs’ cemetery in Bint Jbeil.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 8, 2012. The episode was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Raymie Muzquiz. Plot Enrolling in college on a whim, Bender gets a questionable student loan from the Robot Mafia and falls in with a bad crowd. He then promptly drops out of college, gets addicted to robot drug \\"Spark,\\" does dubious acts for Hedonismbot, and ultimately attempts to rob Girl Scouts (only for them to turn the tables on him) to earn money. His downward spiral leads to his arrest and trial, but his lawyer argues that as a robot, Bender lacks free will and that it was his programming that led to the sequence of events. The judge rules Bender not guilty, much to Bender's dismay. The Planet Express crew is hired to deliver a package to Chapek 9 (last seen in \\"Fear of a Bot Planet\\"), requiring a despondent Bender to come along due to the native robots' intense hatred of humans. After delivering the package, Bender decides to stay on the planet, going on a journey of self-discovery. He eventually finds a religious monastery control by robotic monk named Ab-bot who call their religion \\"Order of the Binary Singularity\\" to take him in. From them, he learns that every Mom Corp. robot has a free will slot, so that they could be upgraded if a corresponding free will unit were ever invented. Bender returns to Earth to find more answers (and walks in on Fry and Leela together in bed). Bender, Fry, and Leela reach the secret laboratory where the module may be kept, but they find Mom waiting for them there. She reveals that a free will unit was designed by Prof. Farnsworth years earlier when he worked at Mom Corp. Farnsworth never completed it after learning of Mom's plan to use the unit to cause a robot uprising that would then be repelled by obedient robots. Bender returns to Planet Express and confronts Farnsworth about the module, insisting that he really completed it and demanding that he give it to him. The Professor admits that he had finished making one complete free will unit, which he has hidden in a talking Bender toy. Bender attempts to use a gun on Farnsworth to force him to hand it over, but Bender discovers that the Professor had programmed a failsafe in all robots that prevents them from taking the unit or attacking Farnsworth. Farnsworth inserts the unit into Bender to give Bender a sample of what free will is like. At first, when Bender attempts to shoot Farnsworth again, it appears the unit is not working. Bender then remembers he forgot to turn off the gun's safety, and shoots the Professor. Bender is taken to court and, now that he has free will, is found guilty of attempted murder. The crew of Planet Express celebrate (except for a severely injured Farnsworth) with Bender as he is taken away. Over the end credits is a rap video featuring Bender and several floozy-bots from previous episodes (such as Hookerbot 5000 from \\"Hell is Other Robots\\" and the two Jewish-American princess robots from \\"The Bots and the Bees\\").

Products Headquartered in Portland, showing their present location Puppet's primary product, Puppet Enterprise, is a commercially supported version of its open-source configuration management tool, Puppet. Puppet IT automation software uses Puppet's declarative language to manage various stages of the IT infrastructure lifecycle, including the provisioning, patching, configuration, and management of operating system and application components across enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructures. In February 2011 Puppet released its first commercial product, Puppet Enterprise, built on the open-source base and providing commercial users with improved usability as well as some commercial components. In September 2011, the company released Puppet Enterprise 2.0, which introduced integration with MCollective, acquired by Puppet in 2010, as well as provisioning for virtual machines directly on Amazon EC2 and VMware. In June 2013, Puppet released Puppet Enterprise 3.0, which features a rewritten orchestration engine that will ease the automated rollout of changes across multiple sites and clouds.New Puppet tool beefs up orchestration automation for enterprise use — Tech News and Analysis. Gigaom.com (2013-06-25). Retrieved on 2013-12-09. Puppet partners and has technology integrations with VMware, Amazon Web Services, Cisco, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure, Eucalyptus, Rightscale, and Zenoss. Built as cross-platform software, Puppet and Puppet Enterprise operate on Linux distributions, including RHEL (and clones such as CentOS and Oracle Linux), Fedora, Debian, Mandriva, Ubuntu, and SUSE, as well as on multiple Unix systems (Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, AIX, HP-UX), and has Microsoft Windows support. It is a model-driven solution that requires limited programming knowledge to use. Puppet purchased the infrastructure automation Distelli in September 2017.https://puppet.com/blog/welcome-distelli-to-puppet-family Puppet rebranded Distelli's VM Dashboard (a continuous integration / continuous delivery product) as Puppet Pipelines for Applications, and K8S Dashboard as Puppet Pipelines for Containers. The products were made generally available in October, 2017.https://puppet.com/blog/introducing-puppet-pipelines-and-puppet- container-registry Puppet released Puppet Discovery, a tool to discover and manipulate resources in hybrid networks, in May 2018.https://puppet.com/blog/announcing-puppet-discovery-general-availability It is Puppet's third stand-alone enterprise product. In computing, Puppet is an open-core software configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. It is written in Ruby, with its free-software version released under the 2.0 (the GNU General Public License (GPL) until version 2.7.0). Facter is written in C++ while Puppet Server and Puppet DB are written in Clojure. Puppet is designed to manage the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively. The user describes system resources and their state, either using Puppet's declarative language or a Ruby DSL (). This information is stored in files called \\"Puppet manifests\\". Puppet discovers the system information via a utility called Facter, and compiles the Puppet manifests into a system- specific catalog containing resources and resource dependency, which are applied against the target systems. Any actions taken by Puppet are then reported. Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system configuration, which can be either applied directly on the system, or compiled into a catalog and distributed to the target system via client–server paradigm (using a REST API), and the agent uses system specific providers to enforce the resource specified in the manifests. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages without the need to specify OS specific commands (such as rpm, yum, apt). Puppet is model-driven, requiring limited programming knowledge to use. Puppet comes in two versions, Puppet Enterprise and Open Source Puppet. In addition to providing functionalities of Open Source Puppet, Puppet Enterprise also provides GUI, API and command line tools for node management. = Architecture = Puppet manually invoked on a client Puppet usually follows client-server architecture. The client is known as an agent and the server is known as the master. For testing and simple configuration, it can also be used as a stand-alone application run from the command line. Puppet Server is installed on one or more servers, and Puppet Agent is installed on all the machines that the user wants to manage. Puppet Agents communicate with the server and fetch configuration instructions. The Agent then applies the configuration on the system and sends a status report to the server. Devices can run Puppet Agent as a daemon, that can be triggered periodically as a cron job or can be run manually whenever needed. Puppet architecture consists of: * Configuration language: The Puppet programming language is a declarative language that describes the state of a computer system in terms of \\"resources\\", which represent underlying network and operating system constructs. The user assembles resources into manifests that describe the desired state of the system. These manifests are stored on the server and compiled into configuration instructions for agents on request. Puppet resource syntax: type { 'title': attribute => value } Example resource representing a Unix user: user { 'harry': ensure => present, uid => '1000', shell => '/bin/bash', home => '/var/tmp' } * Resource abstraction: Puppet allows users to configure systems in a platform-agnostic way by representing operating system concepts as structured data. Rather than specifying the exact commands to perform a system action, the user creates a resource, which Puppet then translates into system-specific instructions which are sent to the machine being configured. For example, if a user wants to install a package on three different nodes, each of which runs a different operating system, they can simply declare one resource, and Puppet will determine which commands need to be run based on the data obtained from Facter, a program that collects data about the system it is running on, including its operating system, IP address, and some hardware information.https://puppet.com/docs/facter Providers on the node use Facter facts and other system details to translate resource types in the catalog into machine instructions that will actually configure the node. * Transaction: A normal Puppet run has the following stages: *# An agent sends facts from Facter to the master. *# Puppet builds a graph of the list of resources and their interdependencies, representing the order in which they need to be configured, for every client. The master sends the appropriate catalog to each agent node. *# The actual state of the system is then configured according to the desired state described in manifest file. If the system is already in the desired state, Puppet will not make any changes, making transactions idempotent. *# Finally, the agent sends a report to the master, detailing what changes were made and any errors that occurred.  Funding  In June of 2018 Puppet raised $42 million for a total of $150 million in funding. The round was led by Cisco and included Kleiner Perkins, True Ventures, EDBI, and VMware. History Puppet Founder Luke Kanies In 2005, Puppet was founded by former CEO Luke Kanies. On Jan. 29, 2019 Yvonne Wassenaar replaced Sanjay Mirchandani as CEO. Wassenaar has held key leadership positions at Airware, New Relic and VMware.

Background Most Improved is a bay horse bred by Skymarc Farm Inc and foaled on 3 May 2009. He was sired by Prix du Jockey Club winner Lawman. Most Improved's dam is Tonnara, a daughter of Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Linamix. Racing career =2011: Two-year-old season= In early August 2011 Most Improved made his first racecourse appearance and finished second in a Newmarket maiden, failing to win by a short head. Three weeks later he raced in another Newmarket maiden, this time winning by five lengths. He then started in one of the top two-year-old races, the Dewhurst Stakes. He finished third in the race, which ended in a bunch finish with only 1½ lengths separating first from fifth. Most Improved was ¾ length behind winner Parish Hall. =2012: Three- year-old season= During the early spring of 2012 Most Improved was backed into second favourite for the 2000 Guineas. However he did not make it to the start of the Guineas, due to an injury sustained shortly before his intended prep run in the Craven Stakes. He made his first appearance as a three-year- old in the Prix du Jockey Club. In a race with a lot of interference he could not get a clear run and ended up finishing a distant fourteenth. He then went to Royal Ascot for the St James's Palace Stakes. He was ridden near the front of the field by jockey Kieren Fallon and took the lead with two furlongs left to run. He stayed at the front and went on to win by ¾ length from Hermival, in a field that also included Irish 2,000 Guineas winner Power and Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf winner Wrote. On his next appearance, Most Improved ran poorly in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, being virtually pulled up in the closing stages by Fallon, as he finished last of the eleven runners behind Excelebration. In the Joel Stakes at Newmarket he finished in seventh place, over 7 lengths behind winner Penitent. =2013: Four-year-old season= In his first race for Aidan O'Brien, Most Improved finished third of four runners in the International Stakes at The Curragh, about ten lengths behind winner Flying the Flag. In Most Improved's final race, he finished last of the ten runners in the Concorde Stakes, which was won by Sruthan.

It is a Grade II listed building.  History  The chapel was founded by Lady Henrietta Hope and Lady Glenorchy after visiting the Georgian natural hot spa resort in 1784. Lady Hope gave £2,500 towards the cost and Lady Glenorchy agreed to have it done. Lady Hope was ill and her friend decided to name it in her honour. However they both died in 1786 so it was Glenorchy's executor that completed their wishes.E. Dorothy Graham, ‘Hope, Lady Henrietta (c.1750–1786)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 17 June 2017 It is said that they decided to build it after finding that the only place of worship was up a steep hill in Clifton.Foyle, Andrew (2004), Bristol, Pevsner Architectural Guides, Yale University Press, By 1851 the church had an attendance of 600 to 700 in the morning and 700 to 800 in the evening. By the 1970s attendance was falling and by 1980 it was no longer used as a place of worship. It then became a community centre named the 'Hope Centre', before reopening in 2000 as Hope Community Church, a Congregational Church. Between 2006 and 2013 Bristol and Regional Archaeological Services (BaRAS) maintained a watching brief overseeing works to excavate the crypt ready for conversion into public space.

The area was designated as such by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2007. Fundy Biosphere Initiative Inc. is an environmental non-profit organization that aims to ensure the conservation of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainable development in the upper Bay of Fundy. Geography The Fundy Biosphere Reserve is situated in south-eastern New Brunswick. It includes the watershed of the Bay of Fundy between Saint Martins and borders Nova Scotia. The central area of the reserve corresponds with Fundy National Park. The reserve also includes the city of Moncton, which is the only official bilingual city in Canada. The Fundy Biosphere Reserve extends over an area of 442,250 hectares adjacent to the upper Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick. The reserve begins at Saint Martins, passes through Moncton, including almost all of Albert County, and stops at the Tantramar Marsh, close to Sackville. The borders of the reserve follow the limits of the watershed of the upper region of the Bay of Fundy. The reserve is divided into three zones: *Core area: 20,600 hectares: devoted to long-term conservation. In the case of the Fundy Biosphere Reserve, this central region is represented by Fundy National Park. *Buffer zone: 26,124 hectares: Human activity in this zone is controlled to ensure the conservation of the core area. The buffer zone includes the protected natural areas of Little Salmon River, Dowdall Lake, McManus Hill, Point Wolfe River Gorge, Caledonia Gorge, Wilson Brook, provincial parks including the Fundy Trail and the Hopewell Rocks, and the National Wildlife Areas of Shepody and Tantramar. *Transition area: 395,552 hectares: reserved for local activities that promote sustainable development. History The initiative to create the Fundy Biosphere Reserve came from a group of volunteers in 1999. The FBR was officially recognized by UNESCO on November 21, 2007. . It became a member of a family of 15 other Canadian biosphere reserves and one of the 531 biosphere reserves throughout the world. At the beginning, the project was called The Fundy Biosphere Reserve Initiative (FBRI). The planning committee was the principal group responsible for the formation of the project and the proposition to obtain UNESCO official designation. The committee met several times to learn more about UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme and to discuss the basic concept of the project. The committee also contacted the Canadian Biosphere Reserves Association (CBRA) to get additional information to guide their initiative. The committee then proposed their strategy to different groups such as conservation groups, resources sectors, academic institutions, scientists, etc. The committee suggested that the region currently recognized be called the Fundy Biosphere Reserve. The unique ecosystems and communities within the limits of the reserve facilitated the categorization of a reserve zone as required by UNESCO. Throughout the process, the committee used the basic standards of UNESCO as guidelines. The principal intention of the planning group was to obtain UNESCO designation. In order to be designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve the committee needed evidence of unique ecosystems, landscapes, and heritage of the region. The committee also sought to enhance the image of the area regionally, nationally and internationally as well as encourage the development of a sustainable economy in the region. At this time, the objectives of the FBR were to encourage investment in the public and private sector, attract technical expertise, and enable scientists to participate in sustainable development strategies. The planning committee’s proposition was based on the following: * Identify the special landscapes in the region of the Bay of Fundy and its unique attributes, * Identify the history and the culture of the region, * Identify citizen initiatives and the various stakeholders’ engagement in the sustainable development of the region. The document proposed by the FBR was subject to several changes and modifications before being approved. It was also revised by the communities, resource groups, scientists and other stakeholders. A temporary board of directors was also established in 2006 to manage the project. UNESCO then gave approval by its Board to continue with the appointment process. The review process was carried out by 16 communities within the reserve, 5 provincial government departments, the Canadian Commission for UNESCO, and a national review committee at the Head Office of UNESCO in Paris, France. The final proposition was submitted to UNESCO in the summer of 2007, and official designation was obtained in the fall of 2007. A press conference followed, conducted by representatives of the FBR and the government of New Brunswick (represented by the Environment Minister) to publicly announce the news. Following the unveiling, the Board of Directors established the structure of the organization, the tasks of each individual board member, communication strategies and the means of financing the organization. Following the official designation, the project was renamed the Fundy Biosphere Reserve (FBR) and Fundy Biosphere Initiative Inc. Organization Fundy Biosphere Initiative Inc. is an environmental, non- profit organization that works in synergy with the local communities, conservation groups, natural resource sectors, tourism organizations, and academic institutions to ensure the conservation of the biodiversity in the upper region of the Bay of Fundy thereby promoting sustainable economic development. The UNESCO Fundy Biosphere Reserve is dedicated to the conservation of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainable economic development. Its vision is to assist communities located in the upper Bay of Fundy to be more sustainable by working with various stakeholders while preserving the area’s natural heritage. To accomplish its mission and vision, the Fundy Biosphere Reserve works in three spheres of activities: *Conservation – Ensure the conservation of ecosystems, species and genetic diversity in the region of Fundy. *Sustainable Development – Promote sustainable development in the region. Sustainable development is a development that is ecologically, socially and economically sustainable for further generations. *Capacity Building – Provide an information-sharing network between the FBR and various stakeholders. Capacity building aims awareness, education, training and research. Among other things, the objectives of the FBR are: *Work with stakeholders in order to help communities become more sustainable. *Exchange information with the public and stakeholders. *Develop a governance model based on Research, Monitoring, Education and Outreach committees. Projects and initiatives Generally, the projects of the Fundy Biosphere Reserve revolve around three fields of activities: conservation, sustainable development, and capacity building. The Fundy Biosphere Reserve’s ongoing projects touch sustainable tourism, local knowledge and climate, trails and amazing places in the Biosphere Reserve and to educate the public on their own environmental footprint.

In between his stints as Cambridge City Manager, Sullivan was City Manager of Lowell, Massachusetts. He also served as President of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. Early life and career Sullivan was born and raised in Somerville, Massachusetts to James Christopher Sullivan and Anna Agnes (Kilmartin) Sullivan. His father died when he was five and his mother had to work to support the family. Sullivan was cared for by his grandparents, Patrick J. and Anna (Kelly) Kilmartin, originally of Doolin in County Clare, Ireland. He attended St. John's High School in North Cambridge. In November 1943 Sullivan enlisted in the United States Navy. He completed radio school in Boston and was assigned as Radioman Second Class on the USS Runels. After the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Sullivan was one of several men sent ashore to evacuate Allied prisoners of war from Japanese camps. Following his honorable discharge, Sullivan enrolled at Boston College under the GI bill. He graduated in 1950 with a degree in history and government and later earned a master's degree in administration and finance. After graduating, he worked for the Social Security Administration in Willimantic, Connecticut. In 1951, he returned to Somerville after he married his wife, Anne. For the next six years, he taught history and government in the Somerville Public School system. He supplemented his teacher's salary by working for the Parks and Recreation Department during the summer and driving a cab. In 1957, Sullivan entered public administration when Arlington, Massachusetts town manager Edward Monaghan appointed him assistant town manager. In 1962, he was chosen as the first Town Manager in Watertown, Connecticut. He was chosen because the selection committee believed he had the \\"perfect temperament\\" to manage the town. In 1966, he moved to Milton, Massachusetts to become executive secretary of that town. First stint in Cambridge On June 24, 1968, the Cambridge City Council voted 5–4 to appoint Sullivan city manager. He was chosen after a six-month search in which 77 applications were sent in from across the country. Sullivan was chosen by the City Council even though he did not apply for the job. He took office on July 15. On May 22, 1970, the City Council voted to consider at its next meeting a motion to fire Sullivan. After the motion passed, Cambridge citizens organized a grassroots committee called SOC'M (Save Our City Manager) to oppose firing Sullivan. On June 1, 1970, the City Council voted 5–4 to suspend Sullivan from office. The meeting was attended by 300 to 400 citizens who were mostly pro- Sullivan. He was given a public hearing on June 11 in which he was allowed to respond to the council's reasons for firing him. It was attended by 1200 people, most of whom were members of SOC'M. Lowell In October 1970, Sullivan was named City Manager of Lowell, Massachusetts. Although he had pledged to not take any other jobs until a referendum was held in Cambridge to determine whether or not he should be reinstated there, Sullivan was convinced by Lowell City Councilor Paul Tsongas to take the job in Lowell. During his tenure in Lowell, Sullivan stabilized the city's tax rate. He also survived a referendum that would eliminate the city manager position, with 83% voting against eliminating the position. He resigned as city manager in February 1974 to return to Cambridge. He was offered $45,000 by the Cambridge City Council to accept the position of city manager there while the Lowell Council could not offer more than $30,000 due to legislation that put a salary ceiling in place. Prior to his departure, Sullivan recommended that his assistant city manager, Robert W. Healy, be chosen as his successor. The city council instead chose former state representative Paul J. Sheehy and Healy accepted the assistant city manager's job in Cambridge. Return to Cambridge Sullivan returned to Cambridge on April 1, 1974. Upon taking office, he promised to shake up the city's housing authority and police department. During his second stint in Cambridge, Sullivan was one of the most outspoken opponents of Proposition 2½. He also dealt with paraquat-contaminated marijuana, a murder inside a school, genetic engineering studies, and the hanging of political signs in the city square. In an effort to increase revenue, Sullivan launched a program to acquire back taxes owed to Cambridge. Delinquent taxpayers netted by the program included the mayor and his brother. On May 18, 1981 Sullivan announced his resignation effective July 1 to become President of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce (GBCC). Prior to accepting the job with the GBCC, Sullivan was considered for the position of general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Sullivan became President of the GBBC on July 1, 1981. He was the Chamber's first full-time executive president. Previously the job was a volunteer position held by a businessman for one or two years. Sullivan retired on December 31, 1991. He was succeeded by William B. Coughlin, president of the Artery Business Committee which merged with the Chamber earlier that year.

Jorgensen is best known for his paintings of Yosemite Valley and the California Missions. Early life and influences Chris Jorgensen was born in Oslo Norway in 1860, to parents Ole and Sophie Jorgensen. Ole Jorgensen died of tuberculosis in 1864, leaving his wife to care for Chris and his four older siblings.Chris Jorgensen, Yosemite Artist. San Francisco: The Yosemite Fund, 2004. In 1870 Sophie immigrated to the United States to reunite with her brother in San Francisco, California. Jorgensen met his future mentor Virgil Williams shortly before the San Francisco School of Design opened in February 1874. Williams, the director of this academy, spotted the young fourteen-year- old Jorgensen sketching near his residence in the city and invited him to be the first free student.Littell, Katherine. Chris Jorgensen: Californian Pioneer Artist. Sonora: Fine Arts Research Publishing Co, 1988. Williams' influence over Jorgensen's budding artistic style was great. As Williams had been exposed to French and Italian methods of painting in his travels abroad, he emphasized the importance of regular exhibition to the young Jorgensen. Jorgensen's lifelong tendency towards classical compositions arose from Williams’ mentorship. Another influential mentor of Jorgensen's was Thomas Hill, a highly successful California artist during the late 19th century. From Hill, Jorgensen developed a more impressionistic technique and learned to intensify the colors in his works by coating them in a heavy glaze. At the end of his course at the School of Design in 1881, Williams appointed Jorgensen an instructor and the Assistant Director of the School. It was in this period that Jorgensen had the good fortune to fall in love with and marry one of his art students in 1888, Angela Ghirardelli, heiress to the Ghirardelli fortune. Yosemite period Indian Head, Watercolor, 1900 Influenced by the travels of Thomas Hill, Virgil Williams and Albert Bierstadt, Jorgensen decided to visit the famed Yosemite Valley in 1898. Two years later, the artist submitted an application to the Yosemite Commission for permission to construct a studio in the valley itself on July 12, 1900. The commission granted their permission for an initial four-year lease which was repeatedly extended. Not only did the commission wish to promote Yosemite's beauty by having a popular artist in residence, but they also had the intention of eventually taking over use of the structure when Jorgensen's lease expired. Jorgensen constructed his home for a total of $5,000Littell, Katherine. Chris Jorgensen: Californian Pioneer Artist. Masters Thesis, Stanislaus, California State University, 1992. and lived there during the summers and some winters from 1900 to 1917. At the time of the artist's occupation, the house's living room was described by the San Francisco Chronicle (February 17, 1901) as one of the “most unique and artistic studios on the coast” containing all manner of objects from skins and baskets to beer steins and water buffalo horns. Jorgensen and his wife Angela donated many Native American baskets to the Yosemite Museum between 1922 and 1929 and many of Jorgensen's works came to the Museum as a bequest from Angelina Jorgensen after her death. Later life and death In 1903 the Jorgensens bought a house in Carmel which they used as a winter studio. This house still exists today as the Hotel La Playa in Carmel. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website. His Yosemite studio became the first museum in Yosemite Valley in 1922 although it was later dismantled. In 1917 when the Jorgensens left Yosemite, they decided to live permanently in Piedmont, California, in order to remain closer to the Ghirardelli family. Jorgensen died in 1935 from a heart attack. His wife lived only several months after him. Works Jorgensen was an unusual artist in the sense that he often chose to paint in watercolor, a medium that was still viewed as inferior to oil painting at this time. However, Jorgensen was more successful in the medium of watercolor than in oil. His style of careful delineation in the foreground and distinct foggy washes in the horizon appears charming in a transparent medium but more primitive in heavier oils. Watercolor also lent itself well to his habit of painting en plein air. During his career as an artist, Jorgensen was successfully received and made a tidy profit selling his paintings both in Yosemite and San Francisco.

The style differs from other forms of hardcore in terms of a faster tempo, usually above 200 BPM, and a loud & distorted offbeat bassline. In the 1990s, drum machines and samplers were used to make this style. As technology developed, DAWs such as Ableton and Cubase became the standard for production. Modern frenchcore is often performed with live musical performers and sampling alongside a DJ set. History Frenchcore is a product of the rave and freetekno scenes in France dating back to the early 1990s. The first frenchcore act, Micropoint, was founded by DJ Radium and Al Core in 1992. In 1994, DJ Radium focused on his solo career and became known as the most significant contributor to the genre in the 90s. He founded Psychik Genocide, one of the first frenchcore labels. Radium eventually became a touring artist and performed across Europe and in the United States. The genre remained underground for many years, being based mostly in France & Italy. The 2010s saw the reinvention of frenchcore, the rise of new artists, and a heavy Dutch influence as the genre became increasingly more popular in the Netherlands. In 2011, the first edition of \\"Frenchcore S'il Vous Plait\\" took place in Culemborg; 2012's edition of Thunderdome, the world's biggest hardcore festival, had an area dedicated exclusively to frenchcore. In 2014, Defqon.1, the world's largest hardstyle festival, added a frenchcore stage for the first time. Dr. Peacock performing with live musicians in Tilburg at Peacock in Concert (2019) The releases on Peacock Records took a different direction from the music DJ Radium and The Sickest Squad were releasing, which created a shift in the genre to a more melodic, psychadelic, and modern sound created by younger producers. In 2016, modern frenchcore's popularity expanded beyond Europe for the first time when Dr. Peacock toured through the United States with performances in New York City, Denver, Phoenix and Pittsburgh. Dr. Peacock also performed in Sydney, Australia that same year. In 2016, several members of Peacock Records started taking more inspiration from hardstyle artists and calling their genre \\"Euphoric frenchcore\\". With the new melodic influence in the genre, the style began to appeal to listeners of hardstyle. Many frenchcore artists began experimenting with the integration of live instruments in their performances, as opposed to performances only using DJ equipment. The genre's popularity grew rapidly when Dr. Peacock's 17 year old protégé Sefa released his first album \\"Leven is Lijden\\" in 2018. The album introduced many hardstyle fans to frenchcore, and Sefa began to perform at major hardstyle festivals regularly. In 2018, Dr. Peacock closed out Qlimax, Q-dance's yearly indoor event at the Gelredome, with the first ever frenchcore set at the show. Style and performance sound system at Amsterdam Dance Event (2016) Frenchcore is characterized first and foremost by its fast tempo and offbeat distorted bassline. Frenchcore, like most forms of electronic dance music, was initially only produced in 4/4 time. The style has recently developed to include different time signatures such as 3/4 and 5/8 and more advanced compositions influenced by classical music. Since the mid 2010s, tracks became more harmonic through the use of pitched kick & bass, just like hardstyle or mainstream hardcore. A frenchcore track typically either has a melody accompanied with the kick & bass harmonically, or the kick & bass on its own in a rhythm focused form. Tempo wise, frenchcore is usually performed at around 200 beats per minute with variation. Since frenchcore tracks are produced at different tempos and performers have to account for their timeslots and different types of events, the tempos within a frenchcore set can vary from 180 BPM all the way to 220 or more, with artists sometimes ending their performances with terror or speedcore. Since uptempo hardcore lies in a similar BPM range, frenchcore artists often mix in uptempo tracks into their sets. Artists from both genres often perform on stage side by side together mixing both genres in one set. Initially, frenchcore was performed by a DJ or a sound system (see free tekno) playing vinyl records. The genre could be heard at nightclubs or teknivals. Modern frenchcore performances often take place at nightclubs, concert halls or music festivals, are now much more commercial and performed on standard DJ equipment. They also sometimes feature extra instruments to add a live element to the show.

He specializes in audio restoration and audio preservation. Graves is a three- time Grammy award-winner and a ten-time Grammy nominee. He is widely considered one of the best audio engineers in his field. Country singer Hank Williams' daughter Jett praised Graves' work on her father's Grammy-winning album The Garden Spot Programs, 1950, calling it \\"the best restoration I’ve ever heard before, the 1% of 1% of restoration engineering.\\" Graves has worked on a wide variety of archival musical projects, working with clients from around the world. Graves' main focus is historical audio that was recorded on deteriorating or obsolete media, as well as more recent recordings on which the sound is obscured for various reasons, utilizing sophisticated state-of- the-art tools and techniques to restore the original audio. His work has often been compared to that of an archaeologist because of Graves' similarly painstaking process of cleaning and restoring old and often damaged archival material. He works with such record labels as Dust-to-Digital, Analog Africa and Omnivore Recordings, which specialize in historical recordings. He has also remastered recordings for commercial release by artists such as Hank Williams, Big Star, Blondie, Nina Simone, Erroll Garner, Buck Owens and Bobby Rush. Graves owns and operates Osiris Studio, a Los Angeles-based mastering and audio-restoration services facility that provides state-of-the-art audio services to the entertainment and archival communities. The studio is named after the Egyptian god of resurrection, reflecting Graves' interest in bringing recordings \\"back to life.\\" Early life  Graves grew up in Texas. He began collecting records from a young age, taking advantage of his father's free travel perks as a Delta Airlines employee to visit record stores across the U.S. and Europe. He graduated from Georgia State University. Career Graves spent the early part of his career in Atlanta. He first became interested in audio restoration after receiving an early CD recorder as a gift in 1998. In the course of digitizing some rare records in his vinyl collection, he became interested in the possibilities of digital audio restoration. In 2002, Graves founded Osiris Studio, initially working with private collectors to digitize and restore their music collections. In 2003, Graves was hired by Georgia State University to help digitize and preserve a substantial portion of its Johnny Mercer collection, one of the world's largest collections of commercial, home and unreleased recordings relating to noted songwriter Mercer. Graves continued working for Georgia State University, preserving assets in GSU's Southern Labor Archives. Graves subsequently expanded his business, performing preservation services for the audio archives of such institutions as the National Park Service (Great Smoky Mountains, Joshua Tree, Sitka and Yosemite archives), Archives of the Episcopal Church, the Coca-Cola Company, Sacred Harp Publishing Company Archives, and the Centers for Disease Control's David J. Sencer CDC Museum. In 2005, Graves met Steven Lance Ledbetter, co-owner of Dust-to-Digital, an influential Atlanta-based record label that specializes in documenting the history of American popular music, including historical recordings of blues, gospel and country music. Dust-to-Digital hired Graves to restore and master the recordings collected on its archival box set Fonotone Records: Frederick, Maryland (1956-1969). That project marked the beginning of a long-running collaboration between Graves and Dust-to-Digital, with Graves restoring and mastering the majority of the label's releases thereafter. Graves won his first Grammy award in 2009, for his work on Dust-to-Digital's four-CD box set Art of Field Recording, Vol. I: 50 Years of Traditional American Music Documented by Art Rosenbaum. The set won in the category of Best Historical Album, with Graves, as mastering engineer, sharing the award with the album's producers, Ledbetter and Art Rosenbaum. In 2011, Graves began working with the archival label Analog Africa, restoring and mastering a large portion of that company's catalog, beginning with the album Bambara Mystic Soul: The Raw Sound of Burkina Faso 1974-1979. Graves received a second Grammy nomination in 2012, for the Dust-to-Digital release Opika Pende: Africa at 78 RPM. The following year, he was nominated for another Dust-to-Digital project, Pictures of Sound: One Thousand Years of Educed Audio: 980-1980. In 2013, after meeting company co-founder Cheryl Pawelski, Graves began a long-running relationship with the reissue label Omnivore Recordings. Graves' first project for Omnivore was his restoration of a set of 1950 Hank Williams recordings for the Garden Spot radio program. The resulting album, The Garden Spot Programs, won Graves his second Grammy award, again in the Best Historical Album category. The same year, Graves was also nominated in the Grammy category of Best Historical Album for his work on the Dust-to-Digital release Longing for the Past: The 78 RPM Era in Southeast Asia. In 2015, Graves assumed mastering and restoration duties for the compilation CD that accompanies the Oxford American magazine's annual music issue. Graves earned a 2015 Grammy nomination, again in the Best Historical Album category, for his work on Dust-to-Digital's 2014 release Parchman Farm: Photographs and Field Recordings 1947-1959. This was followed by a 2016 Grammy nomination, for another Dust-to-Digital album, Music of Morocco: Recorded by Paul Bowles (Dust-to-Digital). Graves received two Best Historical Album Grammy nominations the following year, for Washington Phillips and His Manzarene Dreams (Dust-to-Digital) and Sweet As Broken Dates: Lost Somali Tapes from the Horn of Africa (Ostinato). In 2018, Graves moved Osiris Studio to Los Angeles, where he has continued to work on a wide variety of archival releases. The same year, he won another Grammy award for Best Historical Album, for his work on Dust-to-Digital's Voices of Mississippi: Artists and Musicians Documented by William Ferris. =Other work = Graves is also affiliated with the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) and the Audio Engineering Society (AES).

She was reassigned to the 11th flotilla in August. She was transferred twice more, first back to the 8th flotilla in late August, then the 4th flotilla in mid-February 1945. =1st patrol= The boat's initial foray, which was preceded by a short voyage from Kiel to Egersund (southeast of Stavanger) in Norway, began with her departure from the Nordic port on 1 June 1944 and finished at Bergen on 16 June. She had been attacked by a Norwegian De Havilland Mosquito of No. 333 Squadron RAF on 14 June. Eight of her crew were wounded. A series of brief journeys then followed, between Bergen, Kristiansand, Kiel and Gotenhafen (now Gdynia, Poland). =2nd patrol= She departed Gotenhafen on 7 September 1944. After patrolling the Baltic, she docked at Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) on 5 November. =3rd patrol and fate= After sailing to Libau in western Latvia,The Times Atlas of the World - Third edition, revised 1995, , p. 20 she departed from there on 1 January 1945, arriving in Kiel on the 29th. She was scuttled in Kupfermühle Bay, part of Flensburg Fjord, on 5 May 1945.

It premiered on Network Ten on 1 July 1987. The episode was written by Ray Harding, directed by Rod Hardy, and executively produced by the serial's creator Reg Watson. \\"Episode 523\\" focuses on the wedding of popular couple Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue). The storyline was devised by the producers after some viewers became outraged by the idea of an unwed couple moving in together. They also believed that the wedding would be \\"the perfect climax\\" to the character's long-running relationship and an instant ratings hit. The episode was filmed in secrecy and with a limited budget three months before it was broadcast. The wedding ceremony was filmed in the nave of The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster. \\"Episode 523\\" is one of only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. A new romantic style wedding dress made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace was made for Minogue's character. The ballad \\"Suddenly\\", which was written and sung by Angry Anderson, was chosen as the theme to the episode. Prior to its broadcast, Minogue and Donovan promoted the episode by making several appearances at shopping centres around Australia. \\"Episode 523\\" became one of the most watched soap opera episodes upon its broadcast in Australia. When it aired in Britain in November 1988, it attracted an audience of 19.6 million, making it the third most watched programme in the country that year. The episode was well received by critics and viewers. TV Weeks Kelly Bourne stated that the wedding would be the most exciting television soap opera event of 1987, while Network Ten's head of drama thought it was \\"a major turning point for Neighbours\\". The wedding has been voted one of the most memorable soap moments and is often included in lists featuring the greatest television weddings of all time. Plot The episode opens with Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) bringing breakfast to newlyweds Paul (Stefan Dennis) and Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke). She is surprised to find that they have spent the night in separate bedrooms. To hide the fact that they only married for business purposes, Gail tells Hilary that she and Paul had an argument the night before. Hilary tells them to sort things out and she tends to the bouquets. At the Robinson house, Scott (Jason Donovan) begins to panic about getting married, while his father, Jim (Alan Dale), and best friend, Mike Young (Guy Pearce), set up tables for the reception. Meanwhile, Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) tries to find her pet mice. Over at the Ramsay house, Scott's fiancée, Charlene (Kylie Minogue), is getting ready. Her mother, Madge (Anne Charleston), asks her brother Henry (Craig McLachlan) not to race up the altar. Hilary brings in the wedding bouquet, while Charlene's friend and bridesmaid, Jane (Annie Jones) arrives. After receiving a blue garter from her grandmother, Charlene becomes excited about the wedding. Scott arrives at the church with Mike, Paul and Jim. He is greeted by his old school friends and Mike explains that he and Jane arranged for them to attend to make up for the absence of Charlene's extended family. After the guests take their seats, Scott starts to worry that Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him that she will be there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites everyone to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene that it is time to get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street. Production =Conception= By 1987, Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue) had become a popular couple with Neighbours viewers, who dubbed them \\"TV's Romeo and Juliet\\" because they were from feuding families.Burfitt, Miller, Walker 2012, p.2. Following months of dating, Scott asked Charlene to move in with him. After \\"stuffier viewers\\" became outraged at the idea of the unwed couple moving in together, the producers decided that they should get married instead. Donovan recalled that the producers thought a wedding would be \\"the perfect climax\\" to Scott and Charlene's long-running relationship, as well as an instant ratings winner.Donovan 2007, p.99. Speaking to James Oram, author of Neighbours: Behind the Scenes, Minogue thought the marriage would bring controversial subjects, such as pre-marital sex and HIV/AIDS, into focus. Donovan agreed, saying there was \\"a valid moral point behind it.\\"Oram, James 1988, p.92. Executive producer Reg Watson noted how each character in the show expressed a different point of view about the wedding.Johnston 2005, p.11. Some, like Scott's father Jim (Alan Dale), thought it was \\"stupid\\" for a couple just out of school to get married, while others, like Charlene's mother Madge (Anne Charleston), believed it was romantic. Watson believed the storyline would have repercussions for everyone. =Filming= Ray Harding wrote the script for \\"Episode 523\\". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that it is one of only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The producers asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings.Burfitt, Miller, Walker 2012, p.8. Hardy believed that \\"the magic of the episode\\" is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled \\"The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about.\\" The episode was shot \\"in great secrecy\\" three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating \\"a halo effect\\" around Charlene as she walked up the aisle. The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster was used as the location for the wedding. The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by \\"rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows.\\" Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set.Burfitt, Miller, Walker 2012, p.9. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled \\"The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to be careful that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set.\\" Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the Herald Sun's Nui Te Koha, \\"I don't remember that particular day well, but when you do set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together.\\" =Costumes and music= Charlene's new romantic style wedding dress was designed and made by Isis of Melbourne, a local bridal salon. The dress was made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace. A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery's website observed that it was \\"in keeping with Charlene's character as the suburban girl-next-door.\\" While the show's costume designer, Nicholas Wakerley, called it \\"perfect for the time\\". Wakerley described the dress as being \\"young and cool\\" for the time, just like Charlene. He also revealed that the dress fitted Watson's desire for a fairy-tale wedding. When asked what made the dress memorable, fashion designer Alex Perry, stated \\"There are so many things going on that it's hard not to remember it! The see-through sleeves with a hint of lace, the romantic era-style shoulders, the high neckline and hem.\\" Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time, Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers. Charlene's bridesmaids wore peach taffeta dresses, while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails.Burfitt, Miller, Walker 2012, p.5. Minogue was asked by the producers to choose a romantic song to be played in the episode and she chose \\"Suddenly\\" by Angry Anderson. Anderson had written the song a long time before it was used in \\"Episode 523\\". He explained that it is about a man coming to a certain point in his life when he realises that he does not mind being vulnerable. Minogue told Anderson that she loved the song and how the lyrics resonated with her. She later revealed that she wanted the song played at her own wedding. After \\"Episode 523\\" was broadcast in the UK, \\"Suddenly\\" reached number 3 on the Singles Chart. Promotion and broadcast Network Ten's national publicity director, Brian Walsh, believed the wedding episode would be an ideal marketing opportunity. He arranged for Minogue and Donovan to attend a wedding breakfast at the Park Royal Hotel in Parramatta and invited four hundred competition winners to join them. Minogue and Donovan later made an appearance with the wedding cake at Westfield Parramatta. Walsh recalled \\"I'd never seen anything like it; there would have been 6000 people. Security had to prevent any more going inside. It was as simple as Jason and Kylie and a wedding cake on stage. There was a speech and the cutting of the cake. Then there was this near riot. We had to stop the appearance at this point to prevent people getting crushed.\\" The actors made several more appearances with replica cakes in shopping centres throughout Sydney and Melbourne. They would cut the cakes and then hand out slices to thousands of fans.Burfitt, Miller, Walker 2012, p.7. The episode later become the main focus on covers of TV Week and the Australian edition of Time magazine.Burfitt, Miller, Walker 2012, p.4. \\"Episode 523\\" was first broadcast in Australia on 1 July 1987. Just over a year later, the episode aired in the United Kingdom on 8 November 1988. =Home media= In 1989, Scott and Charlene's wedding was included on a VHS titled The Neighbours Wedding Collection. In 2002, Fremantle included the episode on the Neighbours: Defining Moments DVD box set. The episode was also featured on the Neighbours: The Iconic Episodes Volume 2 DVD box set released in 2009. Reception =Ratings= \\"Episode 523\\" was seen by two million viewers upon its broadcast in Australia, making it one of the highest rating soap opera episodes. When it aired in the United Kingdom, the episode attracted an audience of 19.6 million, making it the third most watched programme in the country that year. =Critical response= Kelly Bourne from TV Week described the episode as \\"the television wedding of the year\\" and \\"a fairytale ceremony.\\" Bourne observed that the wedding would be the most exciting soap opera event of 1987. The head of drama at Network Ten, Rick Maier, stated \\"Scott and Charlene's wedding was the biggest television event of 1987. ... Not only a major turning point for Neighbours, but a wedding that stopped a nation.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald's Michael Idato observed that \\"Australians packed the aisles for the nuptials of star-crossed teenagers Scott and Charlene\\" and added that \\"the nation wept\\" while \\"Suddenly\\" played. Sarah Megginson from SheKnows quipped \\"Scott and Charlene's wedding episode is practically the defining episode of what Neighbours was all about in the 80s. This episode featured the entire cast, and audiences loved watching the romance of off-screen couple Jason Donovan (Scott) and Kylie Minogue (Charlene) spill over on to the small screen.\\" Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, called the episode \\"The biggest event ever in Aussie soap history.\\"Mercado 2004, p.211. Elizabeth Day, writing for The Guardian, commented \\"For many, the quintessential on-screen wedding remains the 1987 marriage of Scott and Charlene in Australian daytime soap Neighbours. It was the apotheosis of a romantic teenage love story which brought together two feuding families – the Robinsons and the Ramsays – in much the same way as the Montagues and the Capulets, albeit with fewer deaths and more shoulder pads.\\" The Birmingham Post's Gemma Quade named the wedding one of her five most memorable Neighbours storylines, calling it a \\"tearjerker episode\\". Josephine Monroe, author of The Neighbours Programme Guide, wrote that the episode showed the \\"soap wedding of the century!\\", adding \\"Teenagers Scott and Charlene tied the knot in a traditional and emotional church service\\".Monroe, Josephine 1994, p.7. During a feature on how to celebrate a wedding ceremony in the style of a soap opera, Tom Cole from the Radio Times said \\"Who needs Mendelssohn and Bach when you can process down the aisle to power ballad 'Suddenly' by Australian rocker Angry Anderson? Sounds unorthodox, but it put pep in the step of Scott and Charlene in Neighbours. Note to groom: we can't all swan around like we're Jason Donovan, so give the feathered mullet a miss.\\" =Impact and legacy= The Holy Trinity Church experienced a surge of interest from fans of the show after the episode aired. The Holy Trinity Church experienced an increase in interest after the episode aired, with some viewers holding their own weddings there. Backpackers also visit the church during their holidays to see the nave where Scott and Charlene were married. The church has since been used again by Neighbours to film the weddings of Harold and Madge, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) and Drew Kirk (Dan Paris) and Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Charlene's wedding dress was donated to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery by Grundy television in 1989. It has since gone on display in the Powerhouse Museum and travelled to Victoria and the UK.Burfitt, Miller, Walker 2012, p.6. A copy of the episode's script, autographed by Harding, fetched £2,000 when it came up for auction in London. In October 1997, the serial's longest serving character, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), was seen watching a video of Scott and Charlene's wedding, before she died. Kathleen Morgan from the Daily Record commented \\"The wedding video brought back memories of the soap's golden years\\". Footage of the wedding was later shown during the soap's 20th anniversary episode, \\"Friends for Twenty Years\\". Charlene became an iconic bridal image, and when Jane Turner and Gina Riley were writing the 2004 season finale of Kath & Kim, they asked Minogue to play the character of Epponnee Rae who was due to get married. Executive producer, Rick McKenna, thought that it would be funny for Minogue to dress up as Charlene and the singer agreed. She appeared as a futuristic version of the character, complete with a lacy dress and 80's style hair. In October 2006, Australia Post brought out five stamps celebrating fifty years of television. Network Ten's stamp featured Charlene and Scott in their wedding attire. In 2007, Herald Sun readers voted Scott and Charlene's wedding as their top Neighbours moment. A Herald Sun reporter said \\"No other wedding in soap history in Australia has captured the attention like Scott and Charlene's nuptials late in 1987.\\" The episode became FremantleMedia's seventh most requested television clip in 2008. To celebrate the soap's 25th anniversary and its 6000th episode, producers decided to \\"recreate the magic\\" of Scott and Charlene's wedding through the marriage of Ringo Brown (Sam Clark) and Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). Robbie said \\"People are saying that my wedding is this generation's Kylie (Minogue) and Jason (Donovan) wedding – that's big shoes to fill.\\" Scott and Charlene's wedding ceremony has often been included in lists about the best television weddings or soap opera moments. It was voted the \\"Most Romantic TV Nuptials of all Time\\" and the \\"Top TV Wedding of all Time\\" in a Radio Times poll. The following year saw the wedding place ninth in a list of the most memorable soap moments. In 2011, the wedding placed third in Channel 5's Greatest TV Weddings programme. It also came third in Virgin Media's \\"10 Best On-screen Nuptials\\" list. Sky Living included the ceremony in their 2012 feature on the best TV weddings, with a reporter noting that it is probably Neighbours' most iconic moment. After including the ceremony in their list of best TV weddings, a writer for MSN New Zealand stated that \\"it set the standard up to which TV weddings (and terrible mullets) are held.\\" In 2019, a writer from Soap World included Scott and Charlene's ceremony in their feature profiling soap weddings. They wrote \\"aww... doesn't it just make you wanna start singing along to 'Suddenly'? This was a Ramsay Street classic - and we hear they're still together!

Eastman (April 30, 1810; January 9, 1885) was an American politician. Born in Deerfield, New Hampshire, Enoch Worthen Eastman studied law in New Hampshire and was admitted to the bar. He then moved to Iowa. Although a Democrat, he distinguished himself the first year of his residence in Iowa by taking the stump against the adoption of the Constitution recently framed by his party and helped to defeat it at the election. Under this Constitution the boundaries of the State would have extended north taking in a large portion of southeastern Minnesota and would have excluded all of the Missouri slope west of a line running north and south from near the west side of Kossuth and Ringgold counties. Enoch W. Eastman, Theodore S. Parvin and Frederick D. Mills, all Democrats and young men, warmly opposed the adoption of such boundaries and influenced enough of their Democratic associates to unite with the Whigs to defeat the Constitution. This was one of the most important public services ever rendered the State. When Iowa was called upon to contribute a stone for the Washington monument in 1850, Enoch W. Eastman was the author of the inscription placed upon it: “Iowa—Her affections like the rivers of her borders, flow to an inseparable Union.” Mr. Eastman removed to Oskaloosa in 1847 and to Eldora in 1857. When the Civil War began he left the Democratic party and united with the Republicans. Eastman was elected Lieutenant Governor of Iowa serving under Governor William M. Stone. In 1883, Eastman was elected to the Iowa State Senate and died while in office.

Merian is a patrician family of Basel, Switzerland. It consists of two branches (an 'elder Basel line' and a 'younger' one) who were citizens of Basel from 1498 and from 1549/1553. The family were represented in the Grand Council of Basel- Stadt in 1532 and grew to become distinguished aldermen. Its notable members include the 18th century politician and the 19th century banker Christoph Merian, who founded the renowned Basel charity Christoph Merian Stiftung. The younger Basel line includes a Frankfurt sub-branch founded by the engraver Matthäus Merian the Elder (1593-1650), whose descendants became artists during the Baroque period and ran what became one of Europe's largest publishers in the 17th century. Matthäus Merian's daughter was the naturalist and artist Maria Sibylla Merian. Origin and distribution The family name is not limited to Basel, and is also found (in variants like Meria, Merian, Meriam and von Merian) in Alsace, Lorraine, Provence, Lower Austria, and Mecklenburg. These families are probably not directly related to the Merians of Basel, but a common root is likely in the former Prince-Bishopric of Basel in the earliest forms of the name Merillate, Merylat, Miregla, Mureglat or Latinized Mariatte. The name probably derives from the office of Meier (meaning steward or estate manager); unlikely, however, is a speculated relationship to the community of Meria in Corsica or to an alleged Merian Abbey in the Archdiocese of Strasbourg, and the same is unlikely with reference to the Marioni nobility from Milan or to de Muriaux in the Bishopric of Basel. The oldest written reference to the family in the bishopric dates from the year 1385 with the mention of a Jehannin dit Mariatte de Buratte (\\"'Johann, called Mariatte, citizens, bears witness'\\"), who resided in a dairy at Bure, Switzerland. This dairy farm had belonged since 1283 to the bishops of Basel, before the dukes of Alsace and the Counts of Mömpelgard/Montbéliard and von Pfirt/Ferrette. Naturalisation in Basel The ancestor of the Merians of Basel is Theobald Merian (c.1415 – c.1505), a Basel episcopal bailiff or steward in Lüttelsdorf (now Courroux) in the Swiss canton of Jura. From him are descended the two Basel branches of the family. The elder line stems from his son Theobald Merian (1465 – 1544), who went in 1480 as a seaman of Lüttelsdorf to Basel and later operated a sawmill on the right bank of the Rhine in Kleinbasel. The younger line from Johann Petrus Merian (c.1468/1478 – after 1519) is thought to be related, as he was an episcopal steward who also came from Lüttelsdorf to Basel, but whether Theobald (the son) and Johann Petrus were brothers and both therefore sons of Theobald (the father) as tradition claims, is unproven. Swiss-born engraver and publisher Matthäus Merian (1593-1650) Frankfurt-born naturalist and illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), depicted on the 500 DM banknote Frankfurt sub-branch In 1624 the Swiss-born engraver Matthäus Merian (a descendant of the younger line) took over the Frankfurt publishing house of his father-in-law Johann Theodor de Bry, and in 1626 he acquired Frankfurt citizenship. After his death in 1650 two of his sons, Matthäus Merian the Younger and Caspar, built up the publishing house under the name Matthäus Merian Seel. In 1687 the publishing house was inherited by a third generation family member, Johann Matthäus Merian (1659-1716), the second son of Matthäus the Younger. Johann's elder brother Carl Gustav Merian was later elevated to the nobility by the Elector of Mainz and appointed to the Privy Council. After Johann's death in 1716 the company was led by his niece Charlotte Maria Merian (1691-1729) until its dissolution in 1727.

It was released through his own label, Bloody Chamber Music, and Essential Music. Background The double album marks ten years since Wolf's debut studio album, Lycanthropy and contains re-recorded, acoustic versions of chosen songs from the previous ten years. The first disc, Sundark, features \\"more solitary darker material\\" and \\"songs that were written in loneliness and not really thinking about other people\\", while the second disc, Riverlight, includes \\"songs of hope and relationship\\" and \\"isolation and solitude on one and togetherness\\". Buffy Sainte-Marie co-wrote the new version of \\"Hard Times\\" after they met in Barcelona during the recording session. Wolf wrote a letter to talk about the album. In the letter, he says, \\"I thought It was time after a decade to take a moment to document what these songs have grown up to be while I've been travelling them around the world.\\" \\"There was a conscious rebellion on this album against the digital age of auto-tune and mass produced electronic landfill music. I want to present at my 10-year anniversary a musical biography.\\" He cites Stephan Micus, Shirley and Dolly Collins's Love, Death and the Lady as influences to the album. The album is also dedicated to Wolf's Russian fans. The album was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios. Gabriel also lent his Bösendorfer grand piano, Bodhrán and Hammered dulcimer to Wolf.

His favourite sister, she was probably also his closest relative and supported him in difficult times. Their correspondence was published as Letters to Ottla.  Life  Hermann and Julie Kafka Ottilie, called Ottla by her family, was born in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, into a middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish family. Her father was the businessman Hermann Kafka (1852–1931), her mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a brewer in Poděbrady. She had three siblings, Franz, Gabriele (\\"Ellie\\") (1889–1944) and Valerie (\\"Valli\\") (1890–1944). She was Franz's favourite sister. She was a close confidant (enge Vertraute), and he called her unbeschadet der Liebe zu den anderen, die bei weitem liebste (the love to the others notwithstanding, the dearest by far). He helped her get an education at an agricultural school. She lived and worked at the agricultural estate of her brother-in-law, Karl Hermann, in West Bohemian Zürau (now Siřem, community Blšany). In 1916–17, she provided her brother with a writing refuge where he was able to write many short stories, and he also lived on Hermann's estate from September 1917 to April 1918, already suffering from tuberculosis. During this time he wrote Die Zürauer Aphorismen (The Zürau Aphorisms). In July 1920, Ottla married the Czech Catholic Joseph David, against her father's will. Their daughters Věra and Helene were born in 1921 and 1923. Franz Kafka watched them grow up until he died in June 1924. The marriage was not happy and they were divorced in August 1942. Ottla thus lost her protection against the persecution of Jews. Like many other Jews from Prague, Ottla and her sisters were deported during World War II by the Nazis. Elli and Valli were sent with their families to the Łódź Ghetto, where they perished. Ottla was sent to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt. On 5 October 1943, Ottla accompanied a group of children as a voluntary assistant. When the transport reached Auschwitz concentration camp two days later, all were murdered.  Legacy  The correspondence between Franz and Ottla Kafka is preserved. It was first published in 1974 by Hartmut Binder and Klaus Wagenbach, and published in English as Letters to Ottla & the Family. In January 2011 it was announced that the original letters were to be sold as a bundle at a Berlin auction house. The German Literature Archive in Marbach hoped to be able to obtain it with help from the private sector; in April 2011 they and the Bodleian Library in Oxford acquired it. They thanked Ottla's heirs for their willingness to sell before the auction, and those who assisted in making it possible to raise the needed funds, including one generous donor who remained anonymous at his own request.

Background When the British North America Act, 1867 was originally drafted, broadcasting had not yet been invented. By the 1920s, Canada had already entered into international agreements on the subject, and there was intense debate as to which level of government in Canada had jurisdiction to regulate this field. Quebec decided to pose reference questions to its appellate court on the matter, and the federal government decided to preempt that hearing by posing the following questions to the Supreme Court of Canada: # Has the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to regulate and control radio communication, including the transmission and reception of signs, signals, pictures and sounds of all kinds by means of Hertzian waves, and including the right to determine the character, use and location of apparatus employed? # If not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent is the jurisdiction of Parliament limited? Initial ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada In a 3-2 decision, the SCC held that radio communication is subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. In his opinion, Anglin C.J.C. supported the statement by Newcombe J. that: and thus noted: Therefore, radio broadcasting could not be considered to be a matter of a local or private nature, but more properly fell within the definition of \\"telegraphs\\" in Section 92(10). Smith J. also concurred. In dissenting opinions, Rinfret J. and Lamont J. held that the Parliament of Canada did not have jurisdiction to legislate on the subject of radio communication in every respect. It fell within the primary legislative jurisdiction of the provinces either under property and civil rights or under local works and undertakings of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, except in cases where the Dominion Parliament has superseding jurisdiction under some of the heads of section 91 and under section 132 (relating to treaties) of the B.N.A. Act. Appeal to the Privy Council The Privy Council, in a ruling delivered by Viscount Dunedin, held that the reasoning of the majority at the SCC was correct. He noted the following reasons why the minority opinions failed: :* unlike in the Aeronautics Reference, the treaty power under section 132 was not relevant, as the international agreements in question were not treaties of the British Empire, but only entered into by Canada :* Canada's obligations under its agreements in this field required it to pass legislation that would apply to all the dwellers in Canada :* no distinction can be made between the operation of the transmitting and receiving instruments :* radio broadcasting could be seen to be similar to \\"telegraphs\\" and to \\"other Works and Undertakings connecting the Province with any other or others of the Provinces, or extending beyond the Limits of the Province\\", both of which are excepted matters reserved to federal jurisdiction under section 92(10) :* as the Section 91 claims were preeminent, it was unnecessary to consider whether broadcasting could fall under property and civil rights or matters of a local or private nature under Section 92 Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed. Impact Federal jurisdiction over radio broadcasting was later held to include television broadcasting and cable television systems.Capital Cities Communications v. CRTC However, broadcasting has been held not to include the operations of internet service providers.Reference re Broadcasting Act, 2012 SCC 4, The question of whether federal jurisdiction over broadcasting includes control of the content of broadcasting has also been answered by the courts. In Re C.F.R.D. and Attorney-General of Canada et al.,(1973) 38 D.L.R. (3rd) 335 Justice Kelly affirmed the federal government's authority to regulate programme content. Chief Justice Laskin delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court in Capital Cities Communications v. CRTC. The Court concluded that programme content regulation is inseparable from regulating the undertaking through which programmes are received and sent on as part of the total enterprise. It appears, therefore, that the decision handed down in the Radio Reference case has subsequently been interpreted to include federal government authority to regulate all facets of the broadcasting industry,including content. Parliament, through its regulatory agency, has utilized this power in an attempt to create and maintain a national broadcasting system that would\\"contribute to the development of national unity and provide for a continuing expression of Canadian identity\\"Broadcasting Act, 1968, s. 3(g)(iv) The Canadian content regulations are merely one aspect of the means accepted to achieve that end.

The present bridge replaces an older bridge, which is thought to have been constructed with timber decking between stone piers. There is evidence that the river was forded here before a bridge was built. The date of the building of the present bridge is unknown; it is considered to have been after 1591, when the previous bridge was described as being \\"in a dangerous condition\\". A date of 1684 has been suggested, but petitions regarding the bridge put before the Quarter Sessions between 1650 and 1750 make no mention of a new bridge between these dates. The bridge was paid for by the County of Lancashire, and later the responsibility for maintenance and repairs was transferred to the Lonsdale Hundred. The bridge is constructed in sandstone blocks, and consists of three segmental arches with triangular cutwaters containing refuges for pedestrians. The arches measure , and respectively. The carriageway is wide, and the maximum width of the bridge at the points of the piers is . It is described as being \\"surprisingly impressive for a route that has little significance nowadays\\". When the bridge was surveyed in 1998, it was found to be adequate to carry vehicles of 40 tonnes. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is a scheduled monument. Loyn Bridge was damaged during Storm Desmond on 5 December 2015. Further damage due to debris caused the bridge to be closed for an extended period. Extensive temporary protection for the bridge and bank were required, along with infill in the bridge piers. The bridge finally reopened on 22 April 2016. Even after the bridge repairs, significant damage to the hedges and fences along the road between the bridge and Gressingham is apparent.

Performance errors relative to sleep loss and extended wakefulness A meta-analysis (Category I) that was conducted by Pilcher and Huffcutt examined data that were drawn from 19 research studies to characterize the effects of sleep deprivation on specific types of human performance. Motor skills, cognitive skills, and mood were assessed in terms of: partial sleep derivation (also known as sleep deprivation), which is defined as fewer than 5 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period for 1 or more days; short-term total sleep deprivation (no sleep attained for fewer than 45 hours); and long-term sleep deprivation (no sleep attained for a period in excess of 45 hours). These researchers found that sleep-deprived subjects performed considerably worse on motor tasks, cognitive tasks, and measures of mood than did non-sleep-deprived subjects. The greatest impact on cognitive performance was seen from multiple days of partial sleep deprivation, although short- and long-term sleep deprivation also showed an effect. Meta-analyses of sleep deprivation effects in medical residents found deficits in both laboratory tasks and clinical tasks. The magnitude of the chronic partial sleep loss has been experienced by astronauts in flight has been reported to negatively impact cognitive performance in multiple Category I, Category II and Category III laboratory and field studies. Performance can be affected whether sleep loss is in the form of a night of substantially reduced sleep, a night of total sleep deprivation, or a series of less drastic, but more chronic, restricted sleep hours. A 1997 study by Dinges et al. revealed that when sleep is restricted to the level that is commonly experienced by astronauts, a \\"sleep debt\\" accrues and, in less than 1 week, performance deficits during waking hours reach levels of serious impairment. Chronic reduction of sleep can impact performance in a manner that is similar to that of total sleep deprivation. A study by Van Dongen et al., which used 48 subjects, evaluated the specific performance effects of chronic sleep restriction in comparison to the effects of 3 nights of total sleep deprivation. Sleep restriction conditions included 14 consecutive nights of 8, 6, or 4 hours of sleep opportunity, with actual sleep quantity validated by polysomnography recordings. Subjects who were subjected to sleep restriction conditions underwent neurobehavioral assessments every 2 hours during their scheduled wakefulness, while subjects who were subjected to the sleep deprivation condition were tested every 2 hours throughout their total 88 hours of sleep deprivation. The neurobehavioral assessment battery that was used in the Van Dongen et al. study included the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). The PVT - which determines alertness and the effects of fatigue on cognitive performance (as determined by lapses in response time and accuracy of responses) by measuring the speed with which subjects respond to a visual or auditory stimulus (by pressing a response button) - has become a standard laboratory tool for the assessment of sustained performance in a variety of experimental conditions. The PVT detects changes in basic neurobehavioral performance that involve vigilant attention, response speed, and impulsivity; and it has been extensively validated in ground-based laboratory studies to detect cognitive deficits that are caused by a variety of factors (e.g., restricted sleep, sleep/wake shifts, motion sickness, residual sedation from sleep medications). The PVT is an optimal tool for repeated use, in contrast to some other cognitive measures, as studies have shown no minimal learning effects and aptitude differences when using the PVT. Figure 3-2. Performance lapses for time in bed (TIB) over 14 days of sleep restriction. Results from these laboratory studies indicate that multiple consecutive sleep episodes of 4 or 6 hours significantly erode performance on the PVT and on measures of working memory, and that performance under these two conditions (i.e., 4 or 6 hours) was comparable to the performance that is found under conditions of 1 to 2 days of total sleep deprivation. Surprisingly, by the end of the 14 days of sleep restriction, subjects in the 4- and 6-hour sleep period conditions reported feeling only slightly sleepy. As these reports were taken when performance was at its lowest level, this indicates that the subjects may no longer have been aware of their performance deficits because of inadequate recovery sleep (figure 3-2). Subjects who spent 4 hours in bed reached levels of impairment at 6 days and of severe impairment at 11 days. Subjects who spent 6 hours in bed reached levels of impairment t 7 days. It appears that subjects who spent 8 hours in bed approached levels of impairment. Figure 3-3, which is from Belenky et al., however, demonstrates that subjects who spent 9 hours in bed did not approach these levels of impairment, indicating that 9 hours in bed may be needed to alleviate the risk of performance errors. Figure 3-3. PVT performance lapses for TIB over 7 days sleep restriction. Similar performance effects resulting from chronically restricted can also be seen in the Category I study by Belenky et al. and in figure 3-3. This study involved 66 subjects who were observed in four conditions (i.e., 3, 5, 7 and 9 hours in bed) for 7 days. PVT testing showed severe impairments in reaction time under the 3-hour condition, with lapses in responses increasing steadily across the 7 days of sleep restriction. Subjects who spent 3 hours in bed reached levels of severe impairment at 5 days, while subjects who spent 5 hours in bed reached levels of impairment at 4 days. These Category I laboratory studies by Van Dongen et al. and Belenky et al. clearly show that subjects suffered performance impairments resulting from total sleep deprivation and/or chronic sleep restriction. Cognitive impairments are present even after an individual has been awake for approximately 17 hours; in fact, recent studies have shown that these decrements are similar to those that result from an elevated blood alcohol level. A compelling Category I laboratory study from Williamson and Feyer used a cross-over randomized control design to observe cognitive and motor performance after minor sleep deprivation to performance after alcohol consumption. All subjects participated in both alcohol consumption and sleep deprivation, and the order of testing was counterbalanced so that half of the subjects participated in the alcohol consumption part first while the other half participated in the sleep deprivation part first. To avoid carry-over effects from one condition to the next, subjects were provided with a night of rest in a motel between each condition. Results indicate that, on average, performance with a blood alcohol level of 0.05% remained equivalent to performance after being awake for 16.9 to 18.6 hours. Performance with a blood alcohol level of 0.1% was equivalent to performance after being awake for 17.7 to 19.7 hours, or to restricted sleep of 4 to 5 hours per night for 1 week. Similar studies that compare performance after a time of sleep deprivation to performance with elevated blood alcohol level have confirmed these results. These findings are compelling as the duration of wakefulness (17 hours), which results in decrements that are similar to those that are induced by a 0.05% blood alcohol level, is considered by many to be within the range of a \\"normal\\" waking \\"day\\"; many individuals can recall an incident in which they had to waken early in the morning and work all day into the night. Astronauts, who sleep on average of 6 hours per night, may be performing critical tasks 17 hours or more after wakening. Performance errors relative to sleep desynchronization and work overload Research suggests that circadian desynchronization and work overload may also impair performance. Specifically, a controlled laboratory study by Wright et al. evaluated the relationship between circadian rhythms and performance by assessing body temperature, which is regulated by the circadian mechanisms of the body. Body temperature is at its highest near the circadian peak and lowest near the circadian minimum (this is when the body is driven to sleep). It has long been recognized that a positive relationship exists between daily rhythms of the body temperature and neurobehavioral performance and alertness in humans. The study protocol forced circadian desynchronization for 12 consecutive 28-hour days; participants were allowed 9.3 hours of scheduled time in bed and 18.7 hours of scheduled wakefulness. Performance on validated measures was evaluated ever 2 hours, beginning 2 hours after the scheduled wake time. The protocol, therefore, assessed performance when the body is normally driven to sleep (which is related to the point at which body temperature is at its lowest) relative to performance during normal waking hours, and allowed for assessment of the effects of body temperature independent of (and associated with) sleep hours and time of day. During the circadian peak ( when body temperature is high), performance and alertness are high; conversely, near the circadian phase of low body temperature, performance and alertness are low. These results have been replicated in other forced desynchrony and extended wakefulness laboratory protocols. Results from these laboratory protocols can be extrapolated to field conditions. Studies in the medical industry, where highly educated and trained individuals (e.g., physicians) are subject to circadian shifting and extended work shifts in addition to sleep loss, further demonstrate serious performance errors with populations that are analogous to astronauts. In a two-session, with subject, Category II experiment that was conducted by Arnedt et al., the performance of 34 medical interns was observed under four conditions: * after 4 weeks of a light rotation (averaging 44 hours of rotations/week) * after 4 weeks of a heavy rotation (averaging 80 hours of rotations/week) * after 4 weeks of a heavy rotation with a 0.05% blood alcohol level * after 4 weeks of a light rotation with a 0.05% blood alcohol level Performance measures included the PVT and a simulated driving task. Findings of the Arnedt et al. experiment indicate that performance impairment after a heavy-call rotation is comparable to the impairment that is associated with a combined 0.04% to 0.05% blood alcohol level and a light-call rotation. Results of this experiment demonstrate that decrements that are created by extended work shifts are similar to the decrements that are created by elevated blood alcohol levels. Work hours and sleep loss were shown to impact performance in a Category III evaluation by Rogers et al. A total of 393 registered nurses logged scheduled hours worked, actual hours worked, time of day worked, overtime, days off, and sleep/wake patterns. Questions concerning errors and near-errors were also included. Analysis showed that work duration, overtime, and number of hours worked per week significantly affected the number of errors. The likelihood of making an error increased with longer work hours, and was three times higher when the nurses worked shifts lasting 12.5 hours or more. Working overtime increased the odds of making at least one error, regardless of the originally scheduled length of the shift. Working more than 40 and more than 50 hours per week significantly increased the risk of making an error. Similar findings were attained in a subsequent Category III evaluation of 2,737 medical interns. A Web-based survey was conducted across the U.S. in which interns completed 17,003 confidential monthly reports. These 60-item reports contained information concerning work hours, sleep, and activities during the month, number of days off, and the number of extended- duration work shifts (defined as at least 24 hours of continuous work). These interns were also asked to report whether they had made significant fatigue- related or non-fatigue-related medical errors. Other questions assessed how often they had nodded off or fallen asleep during patient care or educational activities. Analysis revealed a significant relationship between the number of extended-duration work shifts and the reported rates of fatigue-related noteworthy medical errors. Specifically, the number of reported fatigue- related medical errors increased as the number of extended-duration shifts per month increased. At least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 3.8% of months with no extended-duration work shifts; and at least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 9.8% of months that had between one and four extended-duration work shifts and in 16% of months that had five or more extended-duration work shifts. Furthermore, the frequency of attentional failures was strongly associated with the frequency of extended-duration work shifts. Evidence from this study further corroborates the negative impact that extended-duration work shifts may have on performance, as well as increased accidents and injuries. Working extended hours or overnight shifts also poses the added difficulty of requiring performance from an individual at a time with the body is driven to sleep by the circadian system. Sleep, alertness, and cognitive functioning are determined by the interaction of two processes: the endogenous circadian pacemaker and the homeostatic drive for sleep. The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements. Individuals who work at night and attempt to sleep during the day suffer because the timing of their sleep/wake schedule remains out of phase with the timing of the environmental light. Night workers are particularly prone to vehicle accidents, and their decreased alertness, performance, and vigilance are likely to blame for a higher rate of industrial accidents and quality control errors on the job, injuries and a general decline in work productivity rate. Recent information also suggests that as the body normally releases melatonin when it is dark, working under artificial like at night suppresses the released of melatonin, which may increase the risk of developing cancer. In summation, ground-based evidence demonstrates that sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, and extended work shifts lead to increased performance errors and accidents. The extent to which these risk factors are also present in the space flight environment is therefore an important consideration.

He is often credited with the invention of radar, although his apparatus, called the \\"Telemobiloscope,\\" could not directly measure distance to a target. The Telemobiloscope was, however, the first patented device using radio waves for detecting the presence of distant objects like ships. Background Hülsmeyer was born at Eydelstedt, a village in Lower Saxony, Germany. He was the youngest of five children of Johann Heinrich Ernst Meyer and Elisabeth Wilhelmine Brenning. His birth name was Johann Christel, but after early childhood the name Christian was used. Following completion of the local Volksschule (elementary school), he attended Grundschule (primary school) in nearby Donstorf. A teacher there recognized his capabilities and, in 1896, assisted him in gaining admission to the Lehrerseminare (Teacher Training College) in Bremen. At the school, his major interest was in physics, and, after classroom hours, he was allowed to use the physics laboratory for his own experimenting. His interest was more with the potential applications of physics than with the academic side. In June 1900, Hülsmeyer left college without completing his studies and obtained a job as an electrical trainee in the Siemens & Halske factory in Bremen. There he learned how concepts of devices were turned into commercial applications, intensifying his inventive nature. In April 1902, he left employment with Siemens to live with his brother Wilhelm in Düsseldorf and pursue his ideas for electrical and optical products. His brother initially funded him in setting up a shop where, a number of ideas were quickly turned into working items. These included a device (called a Telephonogram) that telegraphed sounds; an electro-optical system for turning a truck into a mobile, multi-faced billboard; and a wireless apparatus for remotely igniting explosives. Within a year, he filed several patent applications on these and other inventions. The Telemobiloscope In developing the wireless apparatus, Hülsmeyer read of Heinrich Hertz’s discovery that electromagnetic waves were reflected from metallic surfaces. He then turned his full attention to using the Hertz phenomenon in a system for preventing collisions between ships. Giving the name Telemobiloskop (Telemobiloscope) to the system, he made a patent application on 21 November 1903, and also advertised for a financial backer. Henry Mannheim, a leather merchant in Cologne, responded, and in March 1904, invested 2,000 Marks for 20 percent of future profits from the apparatus. The firm Telemobiloskop–Gesellschaft Hülsmeyer & Mannheim was opened the following May and officially registered in Cologne on 7 July 1904. Hülsmeyer’s initial patent application for the Telemobiloscope was rejected, but a refiling, dated 30 April 1904, was accepted, resulting in Patent Publication DE 165546. An article on the system was published in a British technical magazine. The Telemobiloscope was primarily a spark-gap transmitter connected to an array of dipole antennas, and a coherer receiver with a cylindrical parabolic antenna that could rotate 360 degrees. While the transmitted signal had a broad coverage, the receiving antenna was narrowly focused. When a reflected signal reached the receiver, a relay was actuated and, in turn, rang an electric bell. The basic patent description is as follows: Hertzian-wave Projecting and Receiving Apparatus Adapted to Indicate or Give Warning of the Presence of a Metallic Body, such as Ships or Train, in the Line of Projecting of such Waves. The system included a mechanism synchronizing the aiming direction of the receiving antenna with a compass- like indicator; it also included a means of rejecting false signals. Although the Telemobiloscope could not directly indicate range, a separate patent (DE 169154) was granted 2 April 1906, showing a method of using two vertical measurements and trigonometry to calculate approximate range. A relatively detailed description of the Telemobiloscope system, including a copy of the patent, is contained in a paper by Bauer.Bauer, op. cit., pp. 16-18 The first public demonstration of the Telemobiloscope was in the courtyard of the Dom Hotel in Cologne on 17 May 1904. The metal gate to the courtyard was the target, and the transmission path was through a curtain – showing that the apparatus could work when the target could not be seen. The demonstration was reported widely in newspapers, one giving a detailed description.”Die Telemobiloskop,” Kölner Tageblatt, Cologne, 18 May 1904 A conference was held in June 1904, at Scheveningen, the Netherlands, involving the major shipping firms of the region; ship safety was a major topic. After learning of the demonstration at the Dom Hotel, the head of the Holland-Amerika Lijn (HAL) invited Telemobiloskop-Gesellschaft to provide a demonstration of their apparatus during the conference. This demonstration took place on 9 June during a tour through the harbor at Rotterdam aboard the ship-tender Columbus. The Minutes of the conference (contained in the HAL Archives in the Municipal Archives of Rotterdam) include the following description of the demonstration:Bauer, op. cit., p. 35 :The trial on board of the Columbus, though on very limited scale and with an unfinished apparatus, proved that the principle of the inventor is correct. Every time when, even at certain distance, a vessel passed, the apparatus operated immediately. Newspapers carried articles about the demonstration, all giving praise to the new maritime safety invention. One of these closed the article with the following: “Because, above and under water metal objects reflect waves, this invention might have significance for future warfare.””Ship collision avoidance instrument,” De Telegraaf (evening edition), Amsterdam, 11 June 1904 The building of the Telemobiloscope and its demonstrations had depleted the initial funds of the Telemobiloskop–Gesellschaft firm. On 12 August 1904, rights to the system were sold to Trading Company Z.H. Gumpel daselbst of Hannover. The sales agreement, to which Heinrich Mannheim was a signer, said that Hülsmeyer would be given up to 5,000 Marks for future research, and 45 percent of net profits from future sales. It noted that the previous agreement with Mannheim was then obsolete, and after Hülsmeyer has provided proof of the usefulness of his invention, the Gumpel Company would establish a Consortium to commercialize the invention. It also noted that If the Telemobiloscope rights were in turn sold by Gumpel, the sales price would have to exceed 1,000,000 Marks.Bauer, op. cit., p. 39 Improvements were made on the equipment, particularly in extending the operational distance. Patent applications on the Telemobiloscope were filed in a number of countries. The application in Great Britain was granted in only 10 weeks, but most of the others were either withdrawn, rejected, or not processed because fees were not paid. A request was made to Holland-America to allow a demonstration at sea; this was apparently turned down but another demonstration was given near the Hook of Holland in the autumn of 1904. A second conference of the shipping firms was held in London in June 1905; the Conference Minutes include the following:Bauer, op. cit., p. 47 :The Telemobiloscope: A new trial at the Hook of Holland had been a failure. One of the delegates reported also that the principle on which the apparatus is based has been proven to be in error, so that probably nothing more will be heard of it. With the distribution of these Minutes in the European shipping community, the prospect of the Telemobiloscope as a viable product ended. There have been many explanations as to the failure; these mainly cite either poor equipment design or the competition of Marconi. The Telemobiloscope design used wireless technology of the late 1890s, and did not include tuning circuits for frequency selection. By 1904, there were many wireless sets aboard ships and at shore stations, and, without tuning capability, these could not be rejected and thus interfered with the Telemobiloscope operation. As to competition, Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company dominated Europe and had agreements with essentially all shipping firms prohibiting their use of anything except Marconi equipment. The Official Registry in Cologne shows that the Telemobiloskop–Gesellschaft Hülsmeyer & Mannheim firm was dissolved 5 October 1905.Bauer, op cit., pp. 60-61 Also, the agreement with Gumpel to establish a Consortium for commercializing the invention would no longer be applicable. Post-Telemobiloscope activities In 1904, while still heavily engaged with the Telemobiloscope, Hülsmeyer filed for a patent (DE180009) on a machine for diameter reduction of metallic rods and tubes, and in 1906, established a firm supplying equipment for producing incandescent lamps. This was followed in 1907 by his forming the company Kessel-und Apparatebau Christian Hülsmeyer (Boilers and Apparatus Construction) in Düsseldorf; in 1910, he bought a factory site at Düsseldorf-Flingern for the firm. For many years, this company built steam and water apparatus, high-pressure gauges, and anti-rust-filters (trade named “Rostex”). The company continued to operate until 1953. Altogether in his career, Hülsmeyer developed and patented some 180 inventions; these and his various businesses ultimately brought him financial success.Bauer, op. cit., p. 70 Although there is controversy about his inventing radar, Christian Hülsmeyer is still held in high esteem in Germany. In January 1982, Professor K. Mauel gave a lecture at the Organization of German Engineers Center in Düsseldorf on Radar History, celebrating the centenary of Hülsmeyer’s birth. At the 2002 EUSAR Conference in Cologne, the keynote speech was \\"Hülsmeyer – The Inventor of Radar.\\"Joachim Ender; “98 Years of the Radar Principle: The Inventor Christian Hülsmeyer”; http://www.design- technology.info/resourcedocuments/Huelsmeyer_EUSAR2002_english.pdf During a radar conference held in Frankfurt in 1953, Hülsmeyer and Robert Watson-Watt were honored guests. (Watson-Watt had been a leader of radar technology development in Great Britain, and received a patent on the system in 1935). In a discussion with Hülsmeyer as to who was the rightful inventor of this technology, it is said that Watson-Watt ended the discussion by remarking, “I am the father of radar, whereas you are its grandfather.”Bauer, op. cit.', p. 73 On 29 October 1910, Christian Hülsmeyer married Luise Petersen of Bremen. Between 1911 and 1924, they had six children. One of these, a daughter named Annelise Hülsmeyer-Hecker, maintained collection of documents related to her father, and was a source of much that has been written concerning him. She was also instrumental in collecting items, including components of the Telemobiloscope, that are now displayed in the Deutsches Museum. Upon his death in Ahrweiler on 31 Jan. 1957, Christian Hülsmeyer was buried in the North Cemetery at Düsseldorf.Annelise Hecker-Hülsmeyer, quoted in: Pritchard, David; The Radar War - Germany's Pioneering Achievement 1904-1945, Wellingborough 1989,  References  Other references  Category:German inventors Category:Radar pioneers Category:1881 births Category:1957 deaths Category:20th-century inventors ","title":"Christian Hülsmeyer"},{"id":"36677676","text":"Petukhov () is a surname.

Further, contrary to the modern principle of judicial impartiality, it was said that the judges were chosen for their personal knowledge of Nugent. It was also said that pressure was put on the jury to convict, although this was the usual practice in English treason trials. Nugent was found guilty and hanged, but the affair caused such unease that it was later suggested that only English-born judges should sit in Irish Courts as Irish judges were not capable of administering impartial justice.Ball p.150 Death He died in 1598 and was buried at Ashbourne.

They were fitted with Steam brakes and used on Freight duties. A further batch of ten locomotives was built by North British Locomotive Company in February and March 1920. A third batch of ten was on order from Robert Stephenson and Company when the North British Railway became a constituent of the LNER. They were delivered between January and March 1923. They weighed and were numbered to fill gaps in the sequence between 20 and 926. Two of these locomotives were later fitted with Westinghouse brakes in 1929 and were re-classified N15/2. The remainder were withdrawn between 1957 and 1962. =N15/2 Class= Six N15/1 locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company with Westinghouse brakes in 1910. They were used to bank passenger trains up the 1 in 42 Cowlairs incline leading from Glasgow Queen Street railway station. Prior to 1910 trains had been rope hauled by a stationary engine. A further two N15/1 were converted to N15/2 in 1929. They weighed and were numbered to fill gaps in the sequence between 7 and 282 and were withdrawn between 1957 and 1962.

His work is held in several major museums in the United States. Biography Emilio Antonio Cruz was an American Artist of Cuban descent. He was born in the Bronx on March 15, 1938. He studied at the Art Students League and The New School in New York City, and finally at the Seong Moy School of Painting and Graphic Arts in Provincetown, Massachusetts. As a young artist in the 1960s, Cruz was connected with other artists who were applying abstract expressionism concepts to figurative art such as Lester Johnson, Bob Thompson and Jan Muller. He combined human and animal figures with imagery from archaeology and natural history to create disturbing, dreamlike paintings. Cruz received a John Hay Whitney Fellowship and awards from the Joan Mitchell Foundation and from the National Endowment for the Arts. In the late 1968, Emilio and wife Patricia Cruz moved to St. Louis to work with Julius Hemphill and the Black Artists Group. He served as director for the visual arts program, which also included painters Oliver Jackson and Manuel Hughes. In addition to artistic contributions, the couple participated in city-wide civil rights protests and rent strikes. Cruz moved to Chicago and taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago during the 1970s, where he exhibited widely and was represented by the Walter Kelly Gallery. He wrote two plays, Homeostasis: Once More the Scorpion and The Absence Held Fast to Its Presence. These were first performed at the Open Eye Theater in New York in 1981, and later were included in the World Theater Festival in Nancy and Paris, France and in Italy. In 1982 he returned to New York where he began to exhibit again. In the late 1980s he resumed teaching at the Pratt Institute and at New York University. Emilio Antonio Cruz died from pancreatic cancer on December 10, 2004, at St. Vincent's Hospital, aged 66. Work and reception Harry Rand, Curator of 20th Century Painting and Sculpture at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, described Emilio Cruz as one of the important pioneers of American Modernism of the 1960s for his fusion of Abstract Expressionism with figuration. Geno Rodriquez, Curator and Executive Director of The Alternative Museum, wrote in 1985, \\"Emilio Cruz, is a brilliant and impassioned artist whose current paintings are monumental, imbued with intelligence, fury and an apt sense of irony. They reflect the turbulent world within which we live.\\" Geoffrey Jacques wrote in 1990, \\"Emilio Cruz paints humanity’s essence. Mythology and archeology are the foremost concerns of the painter Emilio Cruz. Dinosaurs, skeletal humans and fossil-like images are used in his work as metaphoric signposts in a consideration of the basic questions of existence.\\" Art historian and curator Paul Staiti wrote in 1997, \\"Emilio Cruz's Homo sapiens series is a strange and haunting genealogy of the modern soul... What is at stake here more than biopolitical culture, is the remystification of the body and mapping of consciousness ... For all the trauma, explicit and implicit, Cruz's style is masterful, classical, even beautiful.\\" Exhibitions Cruz held his first solo exhibition at the Zabriskie Gallery in New York in 1963. Afterwards his work was included in many group and solo exhibitions, including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in 1986 and 1991, museum exhibitions at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1987, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1997. In 1994, Cruz's work was shown as part of the American contingent at the IV Bienal Internacional de Pintura en Cuenca, Ecuador. Other American artists exhibiting at this show were Donald Locke, Philemona Williamson, Whitfield Lovell and Freddy Rodríguez. His last show was I Am Food I Eat the Eater of Food at the Alitash Kebede Gallery in Los Angeles in 2004. Cruz's work is held in many collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem; the Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York; and the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82336 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Glass in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Scheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Glass was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Glass included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in- charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History Point Glass was stationed at Tacoma, Washington, from 1962 to 1970 and was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. While moored at Tacoma she was rammed by the Canadian tug Marpole on 26 May 1965 sustaining damage. After 1971 she was homeported at Gig Harbor, Washington.Scheina, p 74 In 1990 she was transferred to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the morning hours of 17 April 1992 Point Glass assisted the disabled MV G.H. Vanderburgh which was floundering in breaking surf and in danger of grounding on a coral reef six miles southwest of Fowey Rocks Light near Miami, Florida. Point Glass successfully navigated 34 miles through 8-10 foot seas to the distressed vessel and determined that she had crossed over the outer reef line and was about to damage the environmentally sensitive coral reef at Biscayne National Park. After passing a line to G.H. Vanderburgh, she towed her to safety, thereby saving the coral reef from damage and preventing harm to the seven man crew of the vessel. For these actions, the Point Glass and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device. In 1998, Point Glass and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Team Commendation with the Operational Distinguishing Device for participating in the Shell Air/Sea show at Fort Lauderdale by being part of the task force enforcing a 3 square mile safety zone near the event and showing the audience a search and rescue demonstration as well as a high speed patrol boat pass. Point Glass was decommissioned on 3 April 2000 and ownership was transferred to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for use at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary where she served as NOAA Research Vessel Point Glass until sold to Point Glass LLC in 2006. The vessel is now used to support the Sea Scout program, part of the Boy Scouts of America, in order to teach navigation and seamanship skills.Point Glass history, Point Glass, LLC websiteNOAA Research Vessel Point Glass (R-8203), Point Glass, LLC website References ;Bibliography  * *  External links  * \\"Point\\" Class 82-foot WPBs Coast Guard Historian's website Glass Category:1962 ships ","title":"USCGC Point Glass (WPB-82336)"},{"id":"36677745","text":"Leberknödelsuppe (Liver dumpling soup) Leberknödel is a traditional dish of German, Austrian and Czech cuisines. Leberknödel are usually composed of beef liver, though in the German Palatinate region pork is used as an alternative. The meat is ground and mixed with bread, eggs, parsley and various spices, often nutmeg or marjoram. In Austria spleen is often mixed with the liver in a 1/3 ratio. Using 2 moistened tablespoons, the batter is formed into dumplings and boiled in beef broth or fried in lard. Due to their looser consistency, the boiled dumplings are meant to be eaten fresh after preparation, although the fried variant are somewhat less perishable due to the crust formed by frying.

Since 1997 SAFE Boats has further expanded to three factory locations in the Port of Bremerton's Olympic View Industrial Park. Their motto is \\"God, Country and Fast Boats.\\" It is contracted by the General Services Administration (GSA) for procurement by U.S. Federal and Government agencies. The current CEO is Richard Schwarz. Notable Clients There are over 2,000 boats currently in service by organizations in over 60 countries around the world. In 2008 the Mexican Navy signed a US$12 million contract for six 33-foot craft, and plans to acquire 30 or more in the next two or three years. In June 2009 the Iraqi Navy acquired 26 of the 25-foot Defender class craft for US$8.4 million. They will be deployed to the Iraqi port Umm Qasr and will secure critical infrastructure; including the Khor al Amaya (Khawr al ‘Amīyah) and al Başrah Oil Terminals in the Persian Gulf. In 2012 Gibraltar purchased two 13m response boats from SAFE Boats International for the Royal Gibraltar Police's role in combating the rise in drug trafficking in the Strait of Gibraltar. The RGP Commissioner, Mr. Yome was quoted as saying \\"These are very high-powered vessels and they give us a further capability out at sea, they also provide more protection for our officers.\\" Media reports linked the purchases with a need to combat increased drug smuggling across the Straits of Gibraltar. =United States government= On February 5, 2011, SAFE Boats International won a U.S. Government contract of $180,611,987.33 to provide 470 Response Boat-Small (RB-S) boats to U.S. Coast Guard shore units in order to perform law enforcement missions. It will also include 20 boats for Customs and Border Protection and 10 boats for the U.S. Navy, for a total of 500 boats. In May 2012 the US Navy announced that SBI beat out two competitors to win a US$30 million contract to build five 78-foot MK VI Patrol Boats with an option for a sixth boat for another US$6million. Ultimately the US Navy plans to purchase 48 MK VI Patrol Boats. The MK VI Patrol Boats are based upon SBI's 780 Archangel-class patrol boat and the new vessels will be the Navy's next generation of patrol boats. They will have the capability to be transported and launched from large-deck LPH LHA and LHD amphibious assault ships. SAFE Boats International stated that the contract would allow them to hire 100 new employees alongside the existing 275 employees. A few months later in July 2012, SAFE Boats International was selected to build the U.S. Coast Guard's new Cutter Boat-Over the Horizon-IV (CB-OTH-IV). SAFE boats will build over 100 CB-OTH-IV vessels over a seven- year period with delivery starting in 2013. The SAFE Boats CB-OTH-IV vessel was selected over three other competitors' vessels. Earmarks In the summer of 2010 an article was published by The Seattle Times claiming that former aides of Patty Murray, the senior United States Senator from Washington, were benefiting from earmarks added to defense appropriations bills. Murray added US$57 million in earmarks to the 2011 defense appropriation bill, of which $19.5 million went to clients of her former aides who now work as lobbyists. According to the article, SAFE Boats International paid lobbying firm Denny Miller Associates US$300,000 in lobbying fees and in 2008 received $6million in an earmark sponsored by U.S. Rep Norman D. Dicks, D-Bremerton. SAFE Boats CEO Scott Peterson said that the 2011 earmark would allow for 15 or more people a year to be hired.

Born in Vienna, he was the eldest of four children. The father Alfred Proksch was a commercial artist, the mother was a model. The profession of the father, obviously stimulated his talent and the interest in drawing very early, even if this, in the years of war, seldom, if ever, could be with his family. Also because of the war, the family left Vienna to live in the country until the end of war. Education and training Returned to Vienna in 1945, he attended secondary school. From 1950 to 1955 he studied graphic design at the Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt, Vienna, where he graduated obtaining the masters diploma. As he took a minor interest in the profession of a graphic designer, he continues, studying painting, at the Academy of fine arts in Vienna, at first at the masters class of R.C.Anderen where from he soon changes to the masters class of Sergius Pauser. There he had the possibility to learn the classical technique of the old masters. After another year of studying at the class of Chr.L.Martin (artistic printing methods) to learn the art of etching, he completed his studies in 1962. That year, he exhibited some etchings for the first time. The first personal exhibition followed in 1963. It was not a great success, but the results were contacts to galleries, art dealers, collectors and subsequently, possibilities to exhibit all over the world. Today Peter Proksch is known as one of the most famous representatives of the Viennese Fantastic Art.

After's Eyadema death in 2005 his son, Faure Gnassingbe, took over, then stood down and was elected in elections that were widely described as having been fixed and which occasioned violence that resulted in as many as 600 deaths and the flight from Togo of 40,000 refugees.

Although Togo's constitution and laws guarantee freedom of speech and of the press, there are considerable restrictions on those rights, with many journalists being fined or sued for defamation, and some engaging in self-censorship to avoid lawsuits or violent reprisals. Libel fines can be as high as 5 million CFA francs (USD 10,000), and the number of libel cases and convictions, especially involving statements about the president and his family, peaked in 2010. In 2011, journalists formed \\"SOS Journalists in Danger\\" after several of them were named in an anonymous note, supposedly from the government, which threatened torture and physical abuse. According to a 2012 report by Freedom House, the size of Togo's private media sector \\"is impressive for a relatively small country, and its content is often highly politicized. There are approximately 30 privately owned newspapers that publish with some regularity, including 2 dailies, about 100 private radio stations...and 8 independent television stations.\\" Print media do not require official licenses, but \\"[p]ervasive impunity for crimes against journalists has created an illiberal media environment marked by self-censorship that persisted during the tense election year of 2010 and only improved marginally in 2011\\". The High Authority of Audiovisuals and Communications (HAAC) is supposed to be an independent agency that protects freedom of the press, in fact it censors the media on behalf of the government, and has the power to suspend newspapers for six months and to confiscate journalists' press cards and equipment. Also, radio stations cannot retransmit foreign programs without HAAC approval. Still, much of the press is very critical of the government, while government-owned media are heavily biased in its favor. Although the private media has grown in the last decade or so, the government still owns the media outlets with the largest audiences, including the only nationwide TV station. In 2012, the HAAC suspended the call-in shows on Légende FM, an order that was backed up by a magistrate in Lomé. The station's news director, Guy Mario, said that it \\"was being punished for its shows in June in which callers had criticized the violent crackdown by security forces on anti-government protests in Lomé....Mario said that the programs, which ran for nine days, featured participants criticizing the government in uncensored language.\\" The station was not given the chance to defend itself in court, which is contrary to Togolese law. \\"We were never informed, invited, or summoned to the tribunal – neither us nor our lawyers,\\" Mario said. During the 2010 presidential election campaign, French journalists were denied accreditation until election day; the situation on this front improved in 2011. There are no restrictions on, or monitoring of, Internet use. A security force is maintained at the University of Lome to intimidate academics, and undercover government informants attend classes. While Togo's constitution and laws guarantee freedom of assembly, it is generally restricted, with the government preventing meetings of its opponents and using force, including deadly force, to disperse anti-government demonstrations. Likewise, though Togo technically guarantees the right to move freely around the country, travel abroad, emigrate, and repatriate, these rights are also restricted in practice, with armed forces manning checkpoints around the country at which they arbitrarily search travelers and demand bribes. In May 2012, a law was passed requiring prior notification of public demonstrations. In the same year, security forces used excessive force to disperse a number of demonstrators, and the head of the ANC was subjected to house arrest to keep him from taking part in protests. Student activists connected to the Mouvement pour l'épanouissement des étudiants togolais (Movement for the development of Togolese students, MEET) were arrested, wounded by rubber bullets, and generally abused. Corruption is a crime, but is rarely punished. <> The 2005 presidential election was rife with fraud, intimidation, and violence, but the 2010 election was relatively peaceful and was considered generally free and fair. The opposition began holding protests in April demanding electoral reforms, calling for an end to the Gnassingbé dynasty, and insisting on respect for human rights. Government security forces brutally put down several demonstrations in mid 2012. In October 2012, a sociology student described the situation as \\"very worrying\\", noting that the opposition \\"is hardening its stance and the government doesn't seem to be listening\\". A former economy and finance minister said at the same time that the Togolese people \\"are angry about the government's slip-ups in terms of human rights, acting arbitrarily and using the judiciary to cling to power\\". In Togo, where 33 percent of the population is animist, 28 percent Catholic, 14 percent Sunni Muslim, and 10 percent Protestant, and where both Christian and Muslim holy days are national holidays, there have been no reports in recent years of abuses of religious freedom or of discrimination based on religious affiliation. Members of different religions regularly invite one another to worship services, according to a 2012 U.S. State Department report on religious freedom, which also notes that religious intermarriage is common. Human-rights groups Human-rights groups in Togo include the Togolese League of Human Rights, the Center for Observation and Promotion of the Rule of Law, and the Togolese Association for the Defense and Protection of Human Rights. Although these groups, as well as many of their international counterparts, are allowed to operate in Togo, the government usually pays no heed to their recommendations. The national assembly also has a human-rights committee, but it plays a minimal role. Women's rights Rape is widespread and is a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison, sometimes 20 years, for example in cases of child rape or gang rape. Victims tend not to report rapes owing to stigma and fear of reprisal. Spousal rape is not a crime, nor is domestic violence, although it is also widespread. Police tend not to get involved in domestic abuse, the government has no official program to address it, and women are unaware of their rights in such situations. Sexual harassment is also widespread, and though it is technically illegal the law against it is not enforced. Families have the right to plan children as they wish. Under the law women are equal, but they suffer social and official discrimination on a variety of fronts, thanks to the enforcement of traditional laws. For example, husbands have the right to tell their wives not to work and have control over the money they earn. Although legally women are entitled to equal pay, this law is not respected in most sectors. Women can own property, but are not entitled to child support or any other payments if they divorce and do not have a right to inherit their husbands' property. Polygamy is common. It is the job of the Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity to ensure that women know what their rights are. Children's rights Children born in Togo or to Togolese fathers automatically become citizens of Togo. In cases where the father is unknown or is stateless, children inherit their mothers' citizenship. Children are required to attend school until age 15, but parents must pay for books and cover other expenses. Child abuse is common, and the law against child sexual exploitation and child prostitution is not well- enforced. Statutory rape is not illegal. There is a degree of child marriage, especially among Muslims. A 2007 law guarantees a wide range of protections for children, and in 2009 the government set up a toll-free line to report child abuse. But the government does little to help orphans and other children in need. Togo is not a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Female genital mutilation has been illegal since 1998, but the law is rarely enforced. According to the U.S. State Department, in 2010 the procedure was performed on about 6 percent of girls. A 2012 report by the German Federal Office for Migration and Asylum noted that the \\"abolition\\" of FGM \\"was officially announced and celebrated at a national ceremony in Sokodé on 29 and 30 December 2012\\". Thanks in part to a German NGO that has run nationwide information campaigns about FGM, and actively sought to help FGM practitioners find other work, \\"there has been a continual decline in female genital mutilation.\\" The German report puts the rate of FGM in girls under 14 at 0.7 percent in 2008 and, contrary to the U.S. State Department report, at 0.4 percent in 2010.\\" In 2012 it was believed to be even lower. According to a 2012 U.S. State Department report on trafficking, \\"Togo is a source and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking....Near the Togo- Burkina Faso border, Togolese boys are forced into begging by corrupt marabouts (religious instructors). Togolese girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are transported to Benin, Gabon, Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and subsequently forced to work in agriculture. Children from Benin and Ghana are recruited and transported to Togo for forced labor. Traffickers exploit Togolese men for forced labor in Nigerian agriculture and Togolese women as domestic servants. Some reports indicate Togolese women are fraudulently recruited for employment in Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Europe, where they are subsequently subjected to domestic servitude or forced prostitution.\\" The Togo government is not doing much to prevent these crimes, but it is trying to do more than it used to. Still, the U.S. State Department issued a long list of recommendations for improvements in legislation, enforcement, prosecution, and prevention. Disabled people's rights Discrimination against people with disabilities is illegal but this law is not well-enforced, nor is the law requiring the government to aid disabled people. Although there is no explicit government discrimination against disabled persons, but societal discrimination exists. There is no law requiring that public buildings be wheelchair-accessible. There is an Agency for Handicapped Persons that runs awareness campaigns, offers job training, and distributes food and clothing. LGBT rights Homosexual acts are punishable by up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of about USD 1,000. There is also widespread antigay prejudice. HIV/AIDS rights Discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS is illegal, but is widespread. Employees' rights Workers have the right to join unions, and most have the right to strike and bargain collectively, within certain limitations. Anti-union discrimination, forced labor and child labor are illegal, but these laws are not well enforced. Many children work as beggars, servants, farm laborers, and at other jobs, the most dangerous being in quarries, with some of them essentially being slaves, while many women are forced to work as prostitutes or domestics. Although employing children under 15 is illegal, some children as young as five years old are in employment. The Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity is supposed to enforce the law against child labor, but enforcement is weak. There are minimum wages for various types of work, but they are very low and unenforced. There are also laws restricting work hours and the like, but these tend to be ignored and unforced. According to a 2012 report by the U.S. Department of Labor, \\"Togo made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor\\" in 2011, with local child labor committees expanding their efforts \\"by tracking the return of trafficking victims and improved coordination by sharing information with government officials during the reporting period\\". Also, Togo's government cooperates with \\"donor-funded projects to combat the worst forms of child labor and operates a hotline to report child abuse\\". Still, Togo has yet to devote \\"sufficient resources to enforce its child labor laws effectively\\" and minors \\"continue to work in dangerous conditions\\". Rights of refugees and asylum-seekers Togo works with international organizations to aid refugees, asylum seekers, and others. Although its laws do not provide for granting asylum or refugee status, the government has set up a system for providing for such persons. As of 2010 several hundred refugees from Ghana were living in Togo. Rights of persons under arrest Police beat suspects during interrogation, routinely and with impunity. Even children are in danger of being beaten in such situations. Although arbitrary arrest and detention are against the law and constitution, they occur nonetheless. As a rule, the police are ineffective and corrupt, and routinely get away with abuses. While a variety of public officials are empowered to issue arrest warrants, persons are still often arrested without warrants and detained secretly. Although the law stipulates that persons in detention have the right to be told of the charges against them and forbids detention without charges for more than 48 (or, sometimes, 96) hours, these rules are often ignored. Political opponents of the government are often arrested arbitrarily. Debtors are also often arrested, also this too is against the law. Rights of persons on trial In 2007, victims of abuse during the 2005 elections had to pay a sum to the court in exchange for having their cases moved forward. Some of those who paid did not get anything in return. Owing partly to a shortage of judges and other qualified judicial officials, defendants are often kept in pretrial detention for long periods, which sometimes are longer than the terms they would have been sentenced to if put on trial and found guilty. Also, there is considerable judicial corruption, with the executive branch exerting influence over judges, and lawyers bribing judges. Judges who support the ruling party are given higher positions than those who support an independent judiciary. There is no presumption of innocence; there is trial by jury; trials are open. Defendants have the right to an attorney, and are provided with one if they cannot afford to pay. This and other rights are generally respected in practice, but defendants' right to see government evidence is not. In rural villages, chiefs or elders are empowered to try minor cases. A young British human-rights volunteer in Togo describes attending a trial at which he was pressed into service as a translator. Rights of persons in prison Prison guards beat inmates, also routinely and with impunity. Prisons are overcrowded and unsanitary, with unsatisfactory food and medical care; sick prisoners must pay guards in order to receive treatment in the infirmary, and also pay fees to shower, use toilet facilities, or have a cot. Sexual harassment of female inmates is common. Prisoners are allowed to see visitors and practice their religions. They are also allowed to file complaints, but authorities generally do nothing in response. Investigations of prison conditions are rare, although groups like the Red Cross are allowed to inspect prison facilities. The Ministry of Justice is purportedly administrating a long-term prison reform program, the Urgent Prison Support Program, funded by the EU, but it has changed little. In June 2010, Togo abolished the death penalty, and all persons who had been sentenced to death had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. A 2012 report by Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) said that \\"Togo's 12 prisons – many of them dilapidated – hold more than twice their designed capacity. The congestion, as well as inadequate food, medical care and poor hygiene have led to diseases and deaths\\". Most of the inmates are people awaiting trial, half of whom have not been charged. The report quoted one prisoner as saying: \\"We sleep very close to one another, with our heads on someone else's feet, like sardines in a tin. At night we sleep in shifts, while some lie down, the others stand against the wall waiting impatiently for their turn.\\" The watchdog group Atlas of Torture ranked Togo the world's fourth worst country when it came to the number of detainees waiting to be tried. IRIN also noted that some persons who are ordered by the courts to be released continue to be held in prison.

An airplane, chartered by the Swedish advertising agency Studio Total, illegally entered the Belarusian airspace on July 4 and parachuted several hundred teddy bears with notes carrying pro-democracy messages. After denying for three weeks that the incident ever took place and calling the footage of the airdrop released by Studio Total a hoax, the Belarus government finally acknowledged on July 26, 2012, that the teddy bear airdrop did happen. The event greatly angered the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, who viewed it as a significant national security failure. Lukashenko sacked two top generals, the heads of Belarus' border guards and of Air Defense, for failing to intercept the Studio Total plane. The airdrop led to an escalating diplomatic crisis in relations between Belarus and Sweden. On August 3, 2012, Belarus expelled the Swedish Ambassador and subsequently ordered the remaining staff of the Swedish embassy to leave Belarus by the end of the month. Belarus also withdrew its ambassador and all of its embassy staff from Sweden. The airdrop On July 4, 2012, a small airplane, chartered by the Swedish advertising agency Studio Total and with two people on board, took off from an airfield in Lithuania and illegally entered the Belarus airspace, crossing the Belarusian border from Lithuania. The plane dropped several hundred teddy bears, carrying cards and notes with pro-democracy, pro-freedom of speech and protest messages, over the Belarusian town of Ivyanets, near Minsk. The organizers of the airdrop originally planned to drop some of the teddy bears over state government buildings in Minsk, but uncertainties over the fuel supply and also the fact that the plane had been contacted by the Belarusian air traffic controllers resulted in a decision to drop the bears over Ivyanets and then head back.

Performers, known as \\"holders of the light,\\" assemble in a line with each person holding one letter. OLB performances present timely messages or political slogans. The Overpass Light Brigade performs at night to increase visibility. Members typically make arrangements for performances and disseminate documentation via social media platforms. Hall manufactures the panels in his shop. He describes his process on the Daily Kos blog to encourage others to use the group's tactics. Photographs taken by Brusky and collaboratively-produced videos are distributed by the group members and fans on the Internet. Brusky joined Hall and Moline in March 2012, to help with social media and the live-streaming of bridge actions. The Overpass Light Brigade often organizes its nighttime demonstrations on bridges and highway overpasses. It also mobilizes members to participate in political rallies and vigils. Actions have included collaboration with national labor advocates regarding Walmart's labor practices, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) strike, environmental advocacy with organizations such as 350.org and Global Climate Convergence, and social justice causes, including police violence, indigenous rights and related issues. Appearances have also have included picketing with striking Palermo's Pizza workers, a pedestrian bridge to the Milwaukee Art Museum, an event with Nuns on the Bus, and vigils mourning the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting and the Boston Marathon Bombing. History Hall and Moline developed the idea for the Overpass Light Brigade through their personal reactions to the movement to recall Governor Walker. They originally used a single panel and string of Christmas lights to create an illuminated \\"Recall Walker\\" sign, which they carried at a local rally. When images of the sign were circulated by mainstream media outlets including The Rachel Maddow Show and CNN, Hall and Moline decided to continue their efforts. Their next step was to create six individual signs that spelled \\"RECALL\\". After attempting to install the signs on the chainlink fence covering a pedestrian bridge across the Interstate (I-43) and learning that doing so is illegal, Hall and Moline enlisted others to help carry the signs as a legal form of display. This participatory dimension to the work gives Overpass Light Brigade gatherings \\"the feel of a celebration, with scores of people gathering on the pedestrian overpasses,\\" according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. For the artists, their work with the Overpass Light Brigade is a \\"demonstration of citizen engagement... a Situationist paradigm of performativity within the contested and liminal zones of public space\\" and a navigation of the tactics of visibility. They cite French critical theorist Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle as an inspiration. Debord explored and explained how contemporary media creates spectacle that is essentially devoid of content. A founder of the artistic and political movement Situationist International, he sought, through the construction of \\"situations,\\" to create multiple strategies for reclaiming an individual's self-determination from the sedative effects of ubiquitous spectacle. Hall and Moline had a history of making collaborative work, often about environmental issues and animal subjects, but rarely pushed beyond the boundaries of traditional art spaces. As a result of the Wisconsin protests, the artists became involved with activist work, in which the use of signs was pivotal. They also worked with other artists, activists, social scientists, and teachers to set up a short-lived political action committee called the Playground Legends, and began working in some of Milwaukee's African American communities on voter education and Get Out The Vote campaigns. The group, with the central notion that public space and public discourse were necessary for functional democracy, set up \\"parties in the parks\\" for neighborhood groups, and used these relational activities to help create cohesion around a political purpose. Brusky, a public school teacher and union organizer, became an integral part of the OLB core after live-streaming focused actions. He is credited with expanding the greater OLB community through his relationships with national Occupy networks. The OLB organization relies on a loose network of volunteers dedicated to \\"peaceful protest and artful activism.\\" Growth Affiliated Light Brigade organizations have been established in cities across the United States and internationally, and have organized to form the Light Brigade Network. Hall emphasizes the importance for groups to consider how a collection of lighted letters can be recombined; to document the action through quality (night-time) photographs, videos, and blog posts; and to use social media to amplify the reach of the message. The Light Brigade Network includes 46 chapters in cities in 21 US states, and six chapters in Croatia, France, (Germany), New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Light Brigade Network actions Light Brigade groups organize actions around issues pertinent to their communities, and often collaborate on larger, national or international campaigns. Some noteworthy actions include: * On April 10, 2014, the PEN American Center organized an event protesting China’s efforts to silence Ai Weiwei and other Chinese artists and writers. This event featured the NYC Light Brigade, holding lighted signs spelling \\"FREE EXPRESSION\\" in English and Chinese. * On January 7, 2015 after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, what has become the Paris Light Brigade brought lights spelling \\"NOT AFRAID\\" to a vigil in Paris. * Throughout December 2015, homes and businesses in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn displayed signs as part of \\"Mi Casa Es No Su Casa: Illumination Against Gentrification.” This project was a collaboration between local activists, the Mayday Space and NYC Light Brigade. * The Chicago Light Brigade has been involved in numerous projects – on their own and in collaboration with other groups – to promote social justice for communities of color. They participated in the Week of Action Against Incarcerating Youth (May 2014) with the \\"Locked Up and Out\\" Rally, and protested the police shooting of Laquan McDonald in December 2015 with the \\"Memorial Blockade\\" in downtown Chicago.  Films The spectacle and \\"mediagenic quality\\" of OLB's actions have made it the subject of several film projects. Overpass Light Brigade, a short documentary by filmmakers Matt Mullans and Dusan Harminc, was released in 2013 and was screened in over 25 venues, including Woods Hole Film Festival, Marfa Film Festival, and the PBS Online Film Festival. Also in 2013, Planned Parenthood, with 371 Productions and documentary filmmaker Brad Lichtenstein, created the \\"Be Visible\\" campaign, with a video highlighting women's stories and featuring the Overpass Light Brigade.

According to one interpretation, the amalaka represents a lotus, and thus the symbolic seat for the deity below. Another interpretation is that it symbolizes the sun, and is thus the gateway to the heavenly world.; Kramrisch, 348-356 The name and, according to some sources the shape, of the amalaka comes from the fruit of Phyllanthus emblica (or Mirobalanus embilica),Harle, 54; Kramrisch, 356 the Indian gooseberry, or myrobolan fig tree. This is called āmalaki in Sanscrit, and the fruit has a slightly segmented shape, though this is much less marked than in the architectural shape.Kramrisch, 354-355 The amalaka itself is crowned with a kalasam or finial,Kramrisch, 350, 355 from which a temple banner is often hung. History The shape first appears (or survives) as an element in the capitals of columns around the time of Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE,Harle, 54 recurring in some capitals of the 1st century CE. In some of these, as at the Great Chaitya at the Karla Caves, and the verandahs to Caves 3, 10 and 17 at the Pandavleni Caves, the amalaka is \\"boxed\\" with a rectangular framework cage.Harle, 54-55; Kramrisch, 352-353 Amalakas appear to have been common at the top of shikhara by the Gupta period, though no originals remain in place. They were to remain standard in most of India, in the Nagara and Kalinga architecture styles of the west and east respectively, but not in the Dravidian architecture of South India.Harle, 111, 140, 166; Kramrisch, 348, 352 Some early temples in the Deccan, such as the 7th-century Lakshamana temple in brick at Sirpur, have amalakas at the corners of some level of the shikhara (but not, as it survives, at the top in the usual way).Harle, 166 Symbolism Like other parts of Hindu temple architecture, there is a large body of symbolic and mystical interpretation around the amalanka. It is seen as a ring gripping and embracing a notional pillar that rises from the main cult image of the deity below it in the sanctum, and reaches up to heaven through the top of the temple.Kramrisch, 348-356.

Krishnavati river, former tributary of Sahibi river, originates near Dariba copper mines in Rajsamand district of Rajasthan, flows through Patan in Dausa district and Mothooka in Alwar district, then disappears in Mahendragarh district in Haryana much before reaching Sahibi river. =Catchment area= The catchment area of the Sahibi River encompasses the following cities and towns: Sikar, Jaipur, and Alwar in northeastern Rajasthan state; Bawal, Rewari, Pataudi, and Jhajjar district in southern Haryana state; and Delhi state. Rajsthan The catchment area of the Sahibi River in Rajasthan is of Jaipur, Alwar and Sikar Districts, between latitudes 27°16' and 28°11' and longitudes 75°42' and 76°57'. Sahibi Basin falls in three Districts of Rajasthan namely: Alwar district (62.11%), Jaipur district (29.30%) and Sikar district (8.59%). Mean Annual Rainfall in Sahibi Basin is 627.60 mm. Highest maximum temperature ranges from 45.45-45.99 °C with a mean value of 45.8 °C, while Lowest minimum temperature ranges from 1.64-3.14 °C with a mean value of 2.45 °C. Haryana It leaves Rajasthan state beyond Kotkasim in Alwar district near village Ujauli and covers a total distance of about 222 km up to Dhasa Bund. It enters Haryana state at Jhabua, near the city of Rewari in Rewari district, after which it re-enters first Rajasthan state near Kotkasim, and then Haryana again near the village of Jarthal. The dry riverbed near Jarthal is wide. During light monsoon rainfall, the river's flat and sandy bottom absorbs all rainwater. Masani barrage on the river lies near Dahuhera. During heavy rains, the river has defined course up to Pataudi railway station and branches off into two smaller streams to Jhajjar, finally reaching the outskirts of Delhi through Najafgarh drain and ending at the Yamuna River. Delhi The Najafgarh Drain or Najafgarh Nallah (nullah in Hindi means drain) is another name for the Sahibi River, which continues its flow through Delhi where it is channelised for flood control purposes. It is a tributary to the Yamuna River, into which it flows. The Najafgarh Drain gets its name from the once famous and huge Najafgarh Lake near the town of Najafgarh in southwest Delhi. The Najafgarh Drain is the capital’s most polluted body of water due to the direct inflow of untreated sewage from surrounding populated areas. Assessing the water quality of wetlands in wildlife habitats, a January 2005 report by the Central Pollution Control Board rated the Najafgarh Drain under category D, along with 13 other highly polluted wetlands.Blot across the Capital: Najafgarh most polluted, Sunday, 10 July 2005,The Indian Expressminister raises a stink over Najafgarh jheel, 22 February 2005, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh basin Delhi’s most polluted area, 25 December 2009, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh drain 11th among highly polluted industrial clusters, 25 Dec 2009, The Times of Indiadrain causes less pollution in Yamuna now, 4 July 2006, The Indian Express Regulators at the Keshopur Bus Depot on the Outer Ring Road are wide with thick and high embankments.

History Prior to 1960, the rain-fed Sahibi River entered Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Lake (Jheel) basin, creating a seasonal lake. A vast area more than was submerged in some seasons. In the following decades, the Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa was channelised by digging a wide drain and connecting it directly to the Yamuna River, completely draining the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel. The Sahibi River flooded in 1977. In response, the Masani barrage was constructed on Delhi-Jaipur highway near Masani village, Rewari.GROUND WATER INFORMATION BOOKLET REWARI DISTRICT, HARYANA, Contributors: Dr. Sunil Kumar, Scientist – ‘B’, Prepared under supervision of Sushil Gupta Regional Director.

Several sites have been found in many locations to establish a pattern of settlement of widespread Indus Valley Civilization along the banks of Sahibi and its tributaries. Archaeological excavation have proven that Indus Valley Civilization people lived here before the Harappan and pre-Mahabharata periods. Among the finds are handmade and wheel-made pottery dated to 3309–2709 BCE and 2879–2384 BCE found on the banks of the Sahibi River at Jodhpura. Other findings include pottery found on the Sahibi riverbed at Hansaka in the Rewari district by INTACH-Rewari. A red stone statue of Vamana Dev, now displayed at the Shri Krishna Museum, Kurukshetra was unearthed in 2002 on the Sahibi riverbed near Bawal. In various other places on Sahibi riverbed, many artifacts have been found, including arrowheads, fishhooks, spearheads, awls, and chisels.A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India from the stone age to the 12th century, Pearson 2009, page 116India Mapped - Sahibi river = Identification with Vedic rivers = Several modern scholars identify the old Ghaggar-Hakra River (of which Tangri river is a tributary) as the Sarasvati river and the Sahibi River with the Drishadvati river of Vedic period, on the banks of which in the Vedic state of Brahmavarta, Indus-Sarasvati civilisation or Vedic Sanskriti developed. Such scholars include Bhargava\\"Location of Brahmavarta and Drishadwati River is important to find earliest alignment of Saraswati River\\", Sudhir Bhargava, International Conference, 20–22 Nov. 2009, \\"Saraswati-a perspective\\" pages 114–117, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, Organised by: Saraswati Nadi Shodh Sansthan, Haryana. The Drishadwati River had formed one border of the Vedic state of Brahmavarta while other was Saraswati river. This is mentioned in the Rigveda, the Manusmriti, and the other Hindu texts as well. Ecology This is an important part of ecological corridor along the route of Sahibi river which traverses from Aravalli hills in Rajasthan to Yamuna via Masani barrage, Matanhail forest, Chhuchhakwas- Godhari, Khaparwas Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, Outfall Drain Number 8 and 6, Sarbashirpur, Sultanpur National Park, Basai and The Lost Lake (Gurugram). It lies 5 km northwest of Bhindawas Bird Sancturay and 46 km northwest of Sultantpur National Park via road. =Ecological concerns= Entire 100 km stretch of Sahibi river and its streams (Sota river, Kotkasim drain and Indori river) in Haryana are ecologically dead. Gurugram also dumps polluted discharge in the riverbed of Sahibi. In some of its reaches, from Mandawar and Kotkasim to Haryana border, meandering of the river causes bank erosion. =Restoration= Government of Haryana is coordinating with Government of Rajasthan to ensure water reaches usually-dry Masani barrage and dying seasonal Sahibi river. Another govt. project is being implemented to direct the extra water of Yamuna river during monsoon to Masani barrage through Jawahar Lal Nehru Canal and Western Yamuna Canal (c.

Its studios are located in south Lubbock on Avenue Q west of Interstate 27, and its transmitter is located separately two miles away south of the studios. Waylon Jennings is a notable former personality of KLLL, working there before joining Buddy Holly on tour. When Buddy died, Jennings returned to KLLL, which had been taken over in 1958 by Sky Corbin and his brother, Slim. The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal described the Corbins as \\"a force locally and were influential throughout the industry\\". Sky was a manager and disk jockey for some twelve years; Slim was a personality on the station. Slim was the advisor and confidant of Jennings. When Jennings took his band, the Waylors, to Phoenix, Arizona, where he became a local sensation, Slim moved his band to Scottsdale, where the two would be close enough to maintain their friendship. Slim was in Nashville, Tennessee, when Jennings got his break.Elvis E. Fleming, \\"Long Before Luckenbach\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. LXL (2014), p. 72. The Corbins co-authored songs recorded by Jennings and Holly. They participated in some of the recording sessions at the Norman Petty studio in Clovis, New Mexico. One song co-written by Jennings and Sky Corbin was \\"Young Widow Brown\\", recorded by Jennings and Frankie Miller in 1960. KBFM, the forerunner to KLLL, began in 1958 as an easy listening station. It transmitted an SCA (Subsidiary Communications Authority) to transmit Muzak brand background music. The transmitter was located at the Great Plains Life Building (now known as Metro Tower) at Broadway and avenue M. Studios were originally at 2442 14th street, but were shortly moved to the fifth floor of the same building as the transmitter and antenna. The station was founded by a Mr. Blankenship. KLLL (AM) was in the same building with its studios on the top (20th) floor. In 1968, KLLL's owners, the Corbins, bought KBFM. It kept its call letters, stayed easy listening by day but carried the country format of KLLL at night when the 1460 AM daytimer signed off. KBFM changed to KLLL in 1971, the year after the 1970 Lubbock tornado. The studio building was damaged and the station relocated to the former KSEL studios on East Broadway; KSEL had moved to 84th and L where at the site of the new channel 28 KSEL-TV (now KAMC). KLLL moved to 50th and L in 1976. The Corbin family hired Jerry \\"Bo\\" Coleman as a radio host and made him a stockholder. In 1978, the Corbins sold KLLL AM/FM to Lubbock County Broadcasting, owned by James Thrash and John Frankhouser. Thrash and Frankhouseer in turn sold the company in 1987 to Pinnacle Broadcasting. KLLL is currently owned by a privately held company Alpha Media Group.http://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/139443/alpha-buys-4-in-lubbock-from-wilks References External links *KLLL-FM's official website LLL-FM Category:Country radio stations in the United States Category:Privately held companies based in Texas Category:Alpha Media radio stations ","title":"KLLL-FM"},{"id":"36678417","text":"William Aden French (1892-1980) was an American newspaper publisher and author.

Diagnosis The Involutinida are characterized by a two chambered aragonitic test consisting of an initial spheroidal chamber, or proloculus, enclosed by a tubular second, or main chamber. The test wall may be bilamellar (two layered), the inner layer being microgranular and often dark, the outer hyaline (ckear, glassy). Coiling may be planispiral or trochospiral, forming a cone. Lamellar thickenings or pillar-like structures may be found in the umbilical region on one ore both sides.Alfred R. Loeblich Jr & Helen Tappan,1988. Forminiferal Genera and their Classification. Van Nostrand Reinhold. Taxonomy Four families are included in Involutinida, three of which, the Involutinidae, Hirsutospirellidae, and Planispirillinidae all have undivided tubular second chambers. The fourth, the Ventrolaminidae has numerous chambers following the proloculus. All four are represented by planispiral or trochospiral forms. History The concept of the Involutinida has developed over the years, beginning with the Involutinidae as described in the Treatise Part C, 1964, which then was included in the Cassidulinacea. The Involutinidae were expanded into the superfamily Involutinacea, named by Zaninetti, 1975, so accommodating additional families. Later, Hohenegger and Piller, 1977, the Involutinacea was redefined as the suborder Involutinina, now the Involutinida.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1994 to October 1995 she ran thirteen times and won six races. As a two-year-old she won two races, including the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York. The following spring, Harayir became the first horse to win a Classic on a Sunday, when she was victorious in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse after being rejected by her regular jockey Willie Carson in favour of her owner's other runner Aqaarid. Her success gave her trainer Dick Hern his fourteenth and final classic winner. Later in the year, Harayir competed successfully against colts and older horses, winning the Hungerford Stakes at Newbury, the Celebration Mile at Goodwood and the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket. She was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Background Harayir was a bay filly with white socks on her hind legs, bred in Kentucky by her owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Farm. She was sired by Gulch, a son of Mr. Prospector, who was named 1988 American Champion Sprint Horse. Gulch was a successful stallion, siring the multiple Group One winner Nayef and the Japan Cup Dirt winner Eagle Cafe. Harayir's dam, Saffaanh failed to win a race in five attempts, but was a daughter of the Irish Oaks winner Give Thanks. As a granddaughter of the broodmare Violetta, Give Thanks was closely related to The Derby winner Teenoso. Harayir was trained by the veteran Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire and was ridden in all but one of her races by Willie Carson. Racing career =1994: two-year-old season= Harayir made her first racecourse appearance at Newbury Racecourse in June 1994. She started favourite for a six furlong maiden race and won by one and a quarter lengths from Royal Rebuke. At Newmarket's July meeting, Harayir was moved up in class to Group Three level to contest the six furlong Cherry Hinton Stakes. Willie Carson sent the filly into the lead a furlong and a half from the finish but she was caught in the last stride and beaten a short head by Red Carnival. At York in August, Harayir recorded her first major win in the Group Two Lowther Stakes. Starting the 2/1 joint favourite, she took the lead entering the final furlong and drew clear to win by three lengths from Gay Gallanta. The Racing Post described the performance as \\"impressive\\", and the filly was made ante- post favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. On her final appearance of the year, Harayir started favourite for the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket, and finished third to Gay Gallanta and Tanami. Gay Gallanta's performance was enough to see her named European champion two-year-old filly. =1995: three-year-old season= Harayir's three-year-old debut saw her matched against colts as she carried top weight of 133 pounds in the European Free Handicap in April. She led briefly in the final furlong before finishing second to Diffident, a French-trained colt carrying 131. In his capacity as jockey for Hamdan Al Maktoum, Willie Carson had a choice of rides for the 1995 1000 Guineas. After being thought likely to partner Harayir he changed his mind and switched to Aqaarid, an unbeaten filly from the John Dunlop stable, leaving the ride on Harayir to Richard Hills: he described the decision as \\"a difficult choice\\". Aqaarid started 3/1 favourite for the 1000 Guineas, with Harayir sharing second place in the betting with the Godolphin filly Moonshell on 5/1. The race was the first British Classic to be run on a Sunday. Hills tracked the leaders on Harayir, before sending the filly to the front a furlong from the finish. Aqaarid and Moonshell emerged from the pack to challenge, but Harayir ran on strongly to win by one and a half lengths. Aqaarid beat Moonshell by three quarters of a length for second, with Gay Gallanta four lengths further back in seventh. Carson was reunited with Harayir for the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later in which the British Classic winner was expected to prove comfortably superior to a field which included the leading Irish filly Ridgewood Pearl. Harayir reached second place in the straight but weakened to finish into fifth place eight lengths behind Ridgewood Pearl, who won easily. Harayir started favourite for her rematch with Ridgewood Pearl in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot where she was expected to be better suited by the firm ground. Ridgewood Pearl however, maintained her superiority, winning by two lengths from Smolensk, with Harayir third. In the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket Harayir suffered a third consecutive defeat after thunderstorms the day before the race softened her preferred firm ground. Attempting to concede six pounds to her opponents, she finished third to Caramba and Gay Gallanta. In August, Harayir was dropped to Group Three level for the Hungerford Stakes at Newbury where she raced against colts and older horses. Despite carrying an eight-pound weight penalty for her Classic win, she started 9/4 favourite and was never seriously pressed to win impressively from the four-year-old gelding Nijo. Fifteen days later, Harayir added a second success in mixed company, beating the colt Darnay by half a length in the Group Two Celebration Mile at Goodwood. In September Harayir moved down to sprint distances for the first time since her two-year- old days and finished fourth to Cool Jazz in the Diadem Stakes at Newmarket. Harayir's final appearance came in the Group Two Challenge Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket in October. She started favourite against a field which included Red Carnival and Cool Jazz, as well as the Lockinge Stakes winner Soviet Line. Carson retrained the filly before moving up to take the lead entering the final furlong. In the closing stages she was pushed out to win by half a length from Soviet Line. After the race, Hern praised the filly's durability and versatility, describing her as \\"a joy to train\\". Harayir was expected to end her career with a run in the Breeders' Cup Mile but sustained a leg injury when exercising at Belmont Park shortly before the race and was retired from racing. Assessment In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Harayir an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas.

It enables computers using Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X to produce musical notation and listen to them in MIDI. Brief history MusicEase was initially created under DOS using muLisp The first version appeared in 1987 and was completely controlled by the keyboard.Rothstein, Joseph (1989), \\"Grandmaster MusicEase Notation Software\\". MIT Computer Music Journal, Volume 13, Number 2, pp.94-95.Rothstein, Joseph (1989), \\"MusicEase Notation Software for IBM PCs\\". MIT Computer Music Journal, Volume 13, Number 3, pp.105-106. In 1995, a Windows version was created using Allegro Common Lisp. Toolbars and mouse support were then added. During the ensuing years, additional functionality was added as new versions were produced. In 2013, version 9.0 was released for both Windows and the Mac. Functionality MusicEase is both a music score editor and an automatic accompaniment generator. As a score editor, the user can create, edit, play and print high quality music notation. The user sees on the computer screen the musical score exactly as it will be printed out. As an automatic accompaniment creator/generator, it allows the user to quickly create accompaniment styles using the full range of notational functionality and to easily apply a style to a melody to add an accompaniment consisting of any number of general MIDI instruments including drums. MusicEase is a constraint-based system with a large amount of knowledge of music notation. This allows it to handle intelligently many of the details of scoring automatically.Rader, Gary (1994) \\"Helping naive users create publication quality music scores\\". TENCON '94. IEEE Region 10's Ninth Annual International Conference. Theme: Frontiers of Computer Technology. Proceedings of 1994 Rader, Gary (1996) \\"Creating Printed Music Automatically\\". IEEE Computer, Volume 29, Issue 6, June 1996, pp. 61-68. For instance, bar lines are inserted automatically according to the current meter (time signature). If the user changes the time signature, the bar line placements change automatically, and beam scopes are automatically recomputed as directed by the new time signature. (Users can also insert barlines themselves wherever they like.) Slurs and phrase marks can often be inserted with a single keystroke combination. The end points, shape, direction and location (above or below the included notes) are automatically determined. The result is that users can create professional looking scores easily and quickly without knowing music engraving/music copyist rules. (Generally no one can create engraver quality printed music without having explicitly been trained in music copyist techniques. And incorrectly notated music is harder for trained musicians to play.) Jerry Pournelle, reviewer for Byte Magazine, says The samples [of music printouts from MusicEase] I have seen, and a couple I have produced, are sure in the same league as hand engraved.Pournelle, Jerry (1990) \\"MusicEase\\". Byte Magazine, Volume 15, Number 13 Since many people are familiar with word processors, the notation aspect of MusicEase is designed to work much like a word processing program. For instance, pressing the G key enters the note G. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) then deletes this note. Pressing the Enter key begins a new system. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) at the beginning of a system appends it to the previous system. Blocks can be cut from one location and pasted into another location and then everything can be reformatted with just several keystrokes (using MusicEase's cast-off function which redetermines system breaks so that the density of notes in each system is roughly the same followed by the justify function to stretch/shrink all staves so they horizontally span from the left margin to the right margin.) Most functions are invoked via key presses which allows fast content entry as opposed to using the mouse to drag music notational elements from palettes to staves which generally requires more effort. MusicEase supports a number of additional generally useful functions such as true transposition (as opposed to just shifting existing configurations up or down on the staff), part extraction (any combination of system staves can be extracted), scaling of the music to a large range of sizes, inverting or retrograding selected blocks of notes, combining 2 staves containing single voices into a single staff containing mixed single and double stemmed voicing and vice versa (splitting a single staff with several voices into 2 separate staves, each containing a single voice), automatically adding chord fret diagrams, using any computer fonts for verses, titles, etc., unicode text support, and displaying music as tablature and/or as shape notes (4 or 7 shape systems --- the shapes associated with scale degrees can be fully customized.) Most notable features *Fast score entry by computer keyboard *Automatically positions most common music notational elements correctly so the user need not know music engraving rules *Library of predefined templates *Transposable guitar chords *Keyboard shortcuts for many common notational elements *Programmable through macros *Import MusicXML, ABC, MIDI *Part extraction *Retrograde and Inversion of user designated portions of notes to facilitate composing *Playback *Cast off *Handbell music notation *Automatic justification *Automatic accompaniment creation and style definition *Automatic chord-name setting for simple melodies *Tablature notation for guitars and mandolins Free version *Free viewer/player/printer; evaluation version Prominent uses MusicEase was used by University of Colorado at Boulder Professor Emeritus of Music Karl Kroeger to create much of the music in Music of the New American Nation - Sacred Music from 1780 to 1820, for which he was the main editor. Professor Kroeger states, In particular, I acknowledge my debt to Gary M. Rader, developer of the MusicEase music notation software used for the musical scoresKroeger, Karl, (ed.) (1995) Music of the New American Nation - Sacred Music from 1780 to 1820, Volume 3, p. ix, Garland Publishing, 1995. MusicEase Software's virtual songbook technology was created using MusicEase Professional. It allows a single piece of music to be ramified in many different ways (e.g., just verses or just the music displayed). Integrity Music, a major publisher of praise-worship music, used this functionality for the transposable sheet music versions of many of its recent products: e.g., the CD-Rom versions of its Hosanna! Music songbooks, versions 3 and 4 of its Worship Software, music available via its worshipleaderassistant.com and Worship Kitchen websites, and various iWorship CD-Rom songbooks. The \\"Shout Music Manager\\" by Media Shout included this virtual songbook technology to provide transposable, customizable printed music. Brentwood-Benson's \\"Praise and Worship Song Book with over 600 Songs\\" (lead sheet edition CD-rom) was also created using this functionality.

The legality of the process varies between tax jurisdictions; most regard it as a type of fraud or tax evasion. Generally, if two independent, unrelated parties negotiate with one other for a financial transaction and eventually reach a price, a transaction in correct market price will take place. According to the arm's length principle, the price at which the transaction occurs is preferred for tax purposes, as it is a fair reflection of the value of the goods or services. However, when the parties that negotiate a transaction are related, they may set an artificially lower price with the intention to minimise their taxes. Because of these tax benefits, transfer mispricing is favored by a majority of large enterprises.  Examples  Assume company A, a multinational which produces a product in Africa and sells it in the United States, processes its produce through three subsidiary companies: X (in Africa), Y (in a tax haven, usually an offshore financial center) and Z (in the US), each of which acts under instruction from A. Company X sells its product to Company Y at an artificially low price, resulting in a low profit and a low tax for Company X in Africa. Company Y then sells the product to Company Z at an artificially high price, almost as high as the retail price at which Company Z then sells the final product in the US. As a result, Company Z also records a low profit and, therefore, a low tax. Most of the apparent profit is made by Company Y, even though it acts purely as a middleman without adding much (if any) value to the product (it is likely that the products never pass the country Y, but are shipped directly from X to Z) Because Company Y operates in a tax haven, it pays very little tax, leading to increased profits for the parent Company A. Both jurisdictions of companies X and Z are deprived of tax income, which they would have been entitled to if the product had at each stage been traded at the market rate. In the previous example it is not a coincidence that the selected country was from Africa. Although the amount of empirical analysis about transfer pricing is quite small, it is clear that the amount of trade mispricing occurring in African exports is higher than that of the developed world, since in Africa there is the insufficient implementation of OECD guidelines and generally less air-tight laws. About 60% of capital flight from Africa is from improper transfer pricing. Such capital flight from the developing world is estimated at ten times the size of aid it receives and twice the debt service it pays. The African Union reports estimates that about 30% of Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP has been moved to tax havens. One tax analyst believed that if the money were paid, most of the continent would be \\"developed\\" by now. Another example is for instance some company producing cars, which has its HQ in Japan and its subsidiary in India. Suppose that the Japanese operations have losses whereas the Indian subsidiary has profits. Even though the Indian subsidiary shows profits, because of the purchases of a component from Japan parent company for an unreasonable high price, the profit of the Indian operations will come down. Therefore, its tax outgo will come down, which is great for the company as a whole. Similarly, the loss of the Japanese firm declines, because of receiving this additional money for the component from Indian subsidiary. The result is that the company producing cars, which composes of the HQ and the subsidiary, has benefited by paying less taxes.  Connection to rational asymmetric development  In general, there is some connection between globalization and concerns about unbalanced development, due to the fact that transfer mispricing has also contributed to rational asymmetric development, according to Asongu: “it refers to unfair practices of globalisation adopted by advanced nations to the detriment and impoverishment of less developed countries”. Another natural and generalizing example of wrong pricing, which lay stress on rational asymmetric development and the fact that the pricing throughout countries incorrectly varies significantly explains Stiglitz : “The average European cow gets a subsidy of $2 a day; more than half of the people in the developing world live on less than that. It appears that it is better to be a cow in Europe than to be a poor person in a developing country…… Without subsidies, it would not pay for the United States to produce cotton; with them, the United States is, as we have noted, the world's largest cotton exporter”  Avoiding transfer mispricing  This issue of prices, for which good and services are sold between the connected persons is addressed by the OECD Guidelines in accordance with international agreements to avoid double taxation. Since in the second half of the 20th century, transfer mispricing had started to become a major problem and therefore, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development) needed to unify regulatory frameworks to efficiently combat this phenomenon. Also, since this issue is concerning various countries, it can only be solved by meticulous cooperation between countries, so the international agreements needed to be made to set forth regulatory guidelines. Concerning this topic, OECD has newly in July 2017 published new consolidated version of the OECD Guidelines called OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017, which includes the revised guidance on safe harbours adopted in 2013, as well as some corrections of the BEPS Actions Plan. The keystone of this OECD Guideline is the Arm's Length Principle, defined in the Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention as \\"conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.\\" Governments have also devised many measures to avoid the misuse of transfer pricing thanks to these OECD publications, which outline several methods that may be used to assess legitimacy of a given transaction. Exactly there are 5 extensively used methods: The Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method, The Resale Price method (RPM), The Cost Plus (C+) method, The Profit Split Method (PSM) and The Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM). The Transactional Net Margin Method is the most commonly used method to verify the correctness of transfer pricing to make sure that it is not case of transport mispricing. One advantage of this method is that all information necessary for application of this method are freely available from all public and commercial databases. Solutions include corporate “country-by-country reporting” where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where real economic activity occurs. Progress is being made in this direction, as documented on a map.Atlas Fiscalisten N.V.: Status of country-by-country reporting in the BEPS-participating countries (OECD and G20), update: February 2, 2016. Whereas appropriate transfer pricing of tangible goods can be established by comparison with prices charged for similar goods to unrelated parties, transfer pricing of intangible goods, products of intellectual efforts, rarely has comparable equivalents. Transfer prices then have to be established based on expectations of future income.Gio Wiederhold (2013): Valuing Intellectual Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens Chapter 4; Springer Verlag, New York, August 2013. Mispricing is rife. Khadija Sharife and John Grobler, writing for the World Policy Journal,http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2013/kimberleys-illicit- process exposed $3.5 billion minimum in transfer mispricing of African diamonds from Angola and DRC, through the use of intra-company valuation, shell companies and tax havens, notably Dubai and Switzerland. In Sweden (a high-tax country) it was popular in 2005–2010 to have \\"interest loops\\", where simple loans or investments were placed between a Swedish company and a tax haven company in both directions, and where the interest rate was mispriced to create a tax deduction in Sweden. This loophole was closed in 2013.

The film was made available on home video by Something Weird. Reception From contemporary reviews, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that the film was a \\"mixture of handsomely decorated spectacle and the supernatural\\" with \\"first rate-editing\\". The review concluded that the reviewer \\"missed the guiding hands of a Bava or Cottafavi; and it seems probable that the film's intermittent drive and suspense can be more safely attributed to Corbucci than to his co-director, Giacomo Gentilomo\\" In Variety, the reviewer \\"Tube.\\" declared that \\"even the most ardent devotees of these overstuffed, simpleminded muscle spasms from Italy figure to be disenchanted with this latest entry in that league.\\" The review found the film \\"ludicrously written and crudely executed\\" and that Gordon Scott's acting was unsubtle. From retrospective reviews, Howard Hughes wrote in his book on Italian cinema that Gordon Scott's performance was \\"above average\\" in comparison to other contemporary genre films. In their book on Italian Sword and Sandal Films, Roy Kinnard and Tony Crnkovich noted that the film's production design by Kosta Krivokapic and Gianni Polidori was aided by Alvaro Mancori's cinematography, which was described as \\"striking\\" and that the film was a memorable entry in the peplum film genre. The review also lamented that \\"most of the available prints have faded color.\\" In his book on Italian peplum films, Barry Atkinson also praised the set design and cinematography as \\"an artful blend of creepy fantasy and Gothicism\\".

Rail service stopped in 1998, although some of the infrastructure remains.  History  The system's history started at the end of the 19th century, when there were no public transport routes in Trafford Park. The size of Trafford Park meant that the Estates Company was obliged to provide some means of travelling around the park, and so a gas-powered tramway was commissioned to carry both people and freight. The first tram ran on 23 July 1897. = Early years = The service was operated by the British Gas Traction Company, which paid a share of its takings to the Estates Company, but by 1899 the company was in serious financial difficulty, and entered voluntary liquidation. Salford Corporation then refused to provide any more gas for the trams, and the service was once again suspended until the Estates Company bought the entire operation for £2,000 in 1900. A separate electric tramway was installed in 1903, and was taken over and operated by Manchester and Salford Corporations in 1905. The takeover did not affect the gas trams however, which continued to run until 1908, when they were replaced by steam locomotives. Between 1904 and 1907 the Estates Company also operated a horse-drawn bus for the use of \\"gentlemen\\" staying at Trafford Hall, then a hotel. The service, available 24-hours a day, was replaced by a motor car in 1907. Under an 1898 agreement between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and to the construction of a permanent connection between the two railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track. In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks roads and railways passed to the Trafford Park Company, as a result of the Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament. = Size of network = The network was also connected to the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway near Cornbrook. At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26 route miles (42 km), handling about 2.5 million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by the increasing use of road transport, and it was closed in 1998. = Closure and demise = By the mid 1980s most of the network had become overgrown and neglected. Throughout the 1990s, as Trafford Park was redeveloped, much of the track was dismantled and crossings removed or tarmacked. However, sections of line do remain albeit isolated and unusable. The branch to Barton Dock freight terminal adjacent to the Trafford Centre became the last part of the maintained system (entirely within Trafford Park) to close. The track was lifted in 2014. Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal, which is on the eastern side of Trafford Park, was formally opened on 5 October 1993 at a cost of £11 million. The site has the capacity to deal with 100,000 containers a year. It uses a small section that was part of the original branch that once connected Trafford Park Railway with the lines of the pre-grouping Cheshire Lines Committee.

She had \\"a lifelong collaborative working relationship\\" with her husband, Massimo Vignelli. She was known to be the business arm of Vignelli Associates and she played a key role in the success of the design firm.Massimo and Lella Vignelli, AIGA website. Early life Lella Vignelli was born in Udine, Italy. She received a degree from the University of Venice's School of Architecture and a tuition fellowship as a special student at MIT's School of Architecture. Since 1956, Vignelli has concentrated on design. Indeed, she was involved in the formation of ADI (Associazione per il Disegno Industriale), the major Italian professional design organization, in the same year. In 1962, she became a registered architect in Milan. Work In 1959, Vignelli joined Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as a junior interior designer in Chicago. In 1960, with her husband, she established the Massimo and Lella Vignelli Office of Design and Architecture in Milan where she specialized in interiors, furniture, exhibition, and product design. In 1965, she formed the corporate design consultancy Unimark International, Corporation for Design and Marketing, with her husband Massimo, Bob Noorda, and Ralph Eckerstrom. Shortly thereafter, Vignelli became the Unimark executive interior designer in its New York office. In 1971, the Vignellis established Vignelli Associates and opened offices in New York, Paris, and Milan. Some of Lella and Massimo Vignelli's most well-known designs from this period involved aspects of brand identity for numerous major clients including Knoll International (1965), for which they led a comprehensive review of the company's visual presence, American Airlines (1967), for which they designed the airline's iconic logo, and the New York City Subway, for which they designed the sign systems and map as Unimark and Vignelli Associates. In later years, the couple's noteworthy commissions included the corporate identities for Bloomingdale's department store (1972) and for automobile and motorcycle manufacturers Lancia (1978) and Ducati (1992), as well as the signage system for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (1997). Their significant furniture designs included the Handkerchief chair for Knoll International (1982), the Serenissimo table (1985) for Italian manufacturer Acerbis, and the Magic coffee table (1990) for Acerbis's lower- priced Morphos label. Other Vignelli designs have also included retail layouts for Artemide, jewelry for Cleto Munari, and glassware for Venini and Steuben Glass Works. In 1978, Vignelli became CEO of Vignelli Designs, being a talented designer in the fields of interiors and product design. She collaborated closely with the architect Denise Scott Brown.Butler, C. et al, eds. 2010. Modern Women: Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Arts. MoMA. LelIa Vignelli was a frequent speaker and juror for national and international design organizations. She was a member of the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), the International Furnishings and Designer Association (IFDA), and the Decorators Club of New York. She and her husband were described as \\"iconic, impossibly exotic characters\\" in New York. In 1972, the Vignellis designed a map for the New York subway system based on \\"abstract simplicity\\". For example, all of the lines bend only at 45 or 90 degrees. Every line has a color. Every stop is designated with a black dot, the corresponding negative of the colored circular signs on the actual platform. Their design firm has helped create branding for many companies including Knoll American Airlines, the Ford Motor Company, American Airlines and Bloomingdale's. Even though their accomplishments belong to both Lella and Massimo, Lella's critical eye guided the rational and geometric language one can find in their work. Lella Vignelli, whose real name is Elena Valle, died in her home in Manhattan on December 22, 2016, at age 82 from dementia. =Awards= Lella and Massimo's work has been recognized by the following: * Compasso d'Oro awards (1964 and 1988) * Gold Medal from the AIGA (1983) * Appraisal in Emilio Ambasz's book of essays, Design: Vignelli (1980), first published by the Comune di Milan, and republished by Rizzol in 1981 and 1990. =Contributions while at Vignelli Associates= Vignelli Associates, founded by Lella and Massimo Vignelli in 1971, worked in corporate identity, transportation, architectural, books, magazines, and exhibition design.

She also believed that design should be integrated into the production process instead of added superficially at the end. Vignelli's design is centered on communication through simplicity and careful planning. She used subtractive design, rather than additive design, to restrain her own influence and allow the essence of the design to come through. Emphasis was placed on existing and ancient motifs and elements, as well as materials' natural characteristics. She viewed words as a way to communicate actual ideas rather than serving as visual decoration, and this is evidenced by her heavy use of black text on a white background. In general, color was used for its emotional and sensual power. As Vignelli Associates, Lella and Massimo's designs embraced corporate identity design alongside exhibition, furniture, product, and publication design. Vignelli Center for Design Studies Massimo and Lella Vignelli agreed to donate the entire archive of their design work in 2008 to the Rochester Institute of Technology, near Rochester, New York. The archive will be exhibited in a new building designed by Lella and Massimo Vignelli, to be known as The Vignelli Center For Design Studies. The building, which opened in September 2010, includes among its many offerings exhibition spaces, classrooms, and offices.

The Nationalists occupied the province of Castellón, but the offensive failed due to bad weather and the dogged resistance of the Republican troops at the XYZ defensive line. Background Following the success of the Aragon Offensive resulting in the Nationalist armies reaching the Mediterranean Sea, the Republic was split in two; the Spanish Republican Army was in disarray and the road to Barcelona was open for conquest by the Nationalists.Graham, Helen. The Spanish Civil War. A very short Introduction. Oxford University Press. 2055. p.98 Even General Vicente Rojo said that Barcelona could have been taken with \\"less force and in less time\\" than in January 1939. The Nationalist generals and Francisco Franco's German and Italian allies expected a swift attack against Barcelona. Nevertheless, Franco decided to turn south against the capital of the Spanish Republic at Valencia,Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.345 because he feared French intervention in Catalonia, following the Anschluss.Preston, Paul. The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.286 Furthermore, he didn't want a swift end to the war, as he wanted a war of annihilation against the Republic in order to crush all opposition. Dionisio Ridruejo said that: \\"A long war meant total victory. Franco chose the crueller option which, from his point of view, was also more effective.\\" Nationalist offensive The Nationalist offensive started on 25 April, with General José Enrique Varela's Army Corps of Castille, Antonio Aranda's Galician corps, and Garcia Valiño's formation, but the advance was halted on 27 April. On 1 May, the Nationalists continued their offensive, advancing on three fronts from Teruel (Varela), the Mediterranean sea coast (Aranda), and a central column moving between them through the mountains (Garcia Valiño). The Nationalists found it slow going due to rainy weather in March and April that slowed the offensive, the difficult terrain that aided the defense of Republican forces being driven back before them, and the dogged determination of the Republican troops, reinforced with new weapons brought in from France: Soviet Supermosca (I-16 Type 10) fighters with four machine-guns, 40 Grumman FF fighters, and anti-aircraft guns. On June 13, Castellón fell to Garcia Valiño's corps after several days of fighting but they were halted short of SaguntoThomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2001. London. p. 808 where the mountains of the Sierra de Espadán came close to the sea. With the fall of Castellón, the Nationalists had a Mediterranean harbor into which munitions and food could be brought to the Nationalists troops in this front.Time Magazine, June 20, 1938, Brazen Attack A view of Viver The Nationalists were surprised by the resistance of the Republican forces, and General Alfredo Kindelán tried to persuade Franco to abandon the operation. The Condor Legion was exhausted and was eventually withdrawn from the front. Nevertheless, Franco ordered the attack to be continued and Valencia be captured by July 25. By the beginning of July, the Nationalists reinforced the front with three divisions of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV), led by General Mario Berti, and four divisions of General José Solchaga's Turia Corps. Furthermore, the Nationalists had nine hundred cannon and four hundred aircraft in this front, and had just received about 50 Italian medium bombers (BR.20, SM.79, SM.81). Opposing the Nationalists, the Republicans had the six army corps (Palacio's XVI Corps, Garcia Vallejo's XVII, Vidal's XIX, Duran's XX and Ibarrola's XXII, as well as Güemes's Group A and Romero's Group B) of General Leopoldo Menéndez's Army of the Levante.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.486 On 5 July, Garcia Valiño attacked from Castellón, but he was stopped by the Republican forces led by Colonel Gustavo Duran and General Menendez at the Sierra de Espadan.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2001. London. pp. 810 The final push of the Nationalist offensive began on 13 July. To the west, Solchaga's corps moved south from Teruel with Varela's corps and the Italian CTV on their flank to the east, and the Garcia Valiño formation tried to advance down the coast.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.347 After some determined resistance at Mora de Rubielos and Sarrion, the Republican line in the Sierra del Toro crumbled. The Nationalists then advanced 60 miles along a front of twenty miles wide until they were stopped by the XYZ Line fortifications running east and west from Viver into the Sierra de Espadan.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2001. London. pp. 810-812 Battle of XYZ line Between July 18 and July 23, these defenses, held by two Republican corps led by Colonels Ernesto Güemes and Carlos Romero, were successful in halting the Nationalist advance. The Nationalists tried to break the republican defenses with waves of infantry and intense bombing raids, but the Republican defenders through the use of well planned trenches and protected lines of communication were able to inflict heavy casualties on the Nationalists (about 20,000 casualties), suffering relatively few themselves (only 5,000 casualties). On July 23, the offensive was halting and the Republican offensive in the north on July 24, the Battle of the Ebro, prevented any further assaults on the line by drawing away eight Nationalist divisions and their heavy artillery.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.352 The Nationalist offensive ended less than forty kilometres from Valencia. Aftermath According to Beevor, the defense of the XYZ Line was a far greater victory for the Republic than the Guadalajara. The Nationalists occupied the province of Castellon, but failed to occupy Valencia and suffered heavy casualties. The Republican Army had time to reorganize, and to plan the assault across the River Ebro.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.349 Furthermore, the Republican forces in Catalonia had time to rearm with the weapons received across the French frontier, which reopened in March.Preston, Paul.

Olympia Motor Show 1908 It was at this show it first became clear British manufacturers now recognised the need to provide medium-sized cars. A host of new models in the 14 to 16 hp class were displayed. Just twelve months later it was believed only Rolls- Royce made solely high-powered cars.The Motor Industry.

Monobloc engine The first version, of which 213 were produced, was sold between 1908 and 1910.David Culshaw, Peter Horrobin, The Complete Catalogue of British Cars 1895-1975, Veloce Publishing, Dorchester UK, 1974 It was powered by a 4-cylinder 2½-litre (2539 cc) monobloc engine with a bore x stroke and a three-bearing crank-shaft. RAC rating would have been 19.64 h.p. It was Austin's only pre-World War I model to have a, by then usual, monobloc casting. The cone-type clutch is leather- faced. The male portion consists of six leather sections riveted to spring plates. Should it be necessary an individual section can be removed cleaned and replaced in a few moments without difficulty.Mechanical Features Of The Motor Exhibition. The Times, Wednesday, 18 Nov 1908; pg. 19; Issue 38807 T-head engine A revised 15 hp model was introduced in 1911 dropping the monobloc engine and reverting to Austin's usual individually cast cylinders side-valve T-head engine design but an increased stroke of gave a capacity of 2838 cc With the same bore it remained rated at 19.6 hp. Austin manufactured 688 of these more powerful cars. It had a four-speed gearbox with cone clutch, shaft and bevel-drive back axle. Suspension was provided by semi-elliptic leaf springs at the front and Austin-patent full-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Brakes were by rear wheel drum and transmission brakes. The wheels were wooden artillery style wheels with Michelin detachable rims, 815 x 105 beaded-edge tyres. In 1913, a powered chassis with tyres was available for £350. Bodies As with other Austins of the period it was available in a wide range of Austin-made bodies, including a two-seater \\"Harrogate\\" (with single rear dicky seat), a two-seater \\"Ascot\\", a four-seater \\"Westminster Landaulet\\" or \\"Levee Single Landaulet\\" and a snub-nose \\"Town Carriage\\" with an open driver and closed passenger layout. Cab or town carriage 1908 J D Siddeley reviews the design of Herbert Austin's vehicle displayed at Olympia's Commercial Motor Vehicle Exhibition, April 1908. The Austin four-cylinder chassis is as sound as it is unconventional, the motor is under the driver's seat. Its four cylinders are in one block which forms part of the same casting as the top of the crankcase. Motor and gearbox are built on an underframe secured to the chassis' main frame by rubber insulated bolts at three different points. The underframe may be dropped complete as one unit for adjustments or repairs. The Austin mainframe is not incurved forward as is now usual but finishes about three feet from the front and from the mainframe's cross-members a narrower frame extends forward providing the necessary space for the great steering lock demanded by the Scotland Yard regulations. The regulations demand the ability to turn completely in a road just 25 feet wide. Motor Engineering by J. D. Siddeley.The Times, Wednesday, 8 Apr 1908; pg. 4; Issue 38615.

Career  In the 1930s, Šlomović moved to Paris, where he was befriended by legendary art collector Ambroise Vollard. Through Vollard, Šlomović met the greatest artists of the age, including Picasso, Matisse, Cocteau, Rouault among others, and was able to amass an impressive personal collection of some 600 works. Vollard died in a car accident in July 1939. Shortly after that, with France on the brink of Nazi invasion, Šlomović decided to return to Yugoslavia, where the war had not yet spread. He left about 200 artworks in a vault in the Société Générale in Paris, and the rest he had shipped via diplomatic pouch to Belgrade. These were exhibited at a highly acclaimed exhibition in Zagreb in 1940.\\"Collection Erich Chlomovitch\\" Musee National de Belgrade, published by Muzejsko - galerijski centar, Zagreb, Croatia, 1989 World War II During World War II, with the Independent State of Croatia establishment in 1941, Šlomović and his family moved to Bačina in Serbia in an attempt to save themselves. While in Bačina, Šlomović hid the paintings he brought with him. Later, as a part of the German reprisals of 100 Serbian men shot for every German soldier killed, Bernard, Erich and Egon were taken to detention camp in Ćuprija. Soon after, they were all killed. Erich's mother Rosa and female cousin Mara were not touched and neither was his collection. They both survived the Holocaust hidden by the local population. Legacy After his death, Šlomović's mother donated his collection to the National Museum of Serbia. In 1989 Veljko Bulajić directed Donator, a movie dedicated to Šlomović's tragic life while in 2004 Momo Kapor wrote a book about his life. The paintings in the Société Generale bank were discovered in 1979 when the bank was allowed to open the vault to recover unpaid storage fees. There is a legal dispute over the ownership of those paintings.

It is located in the village of Mosale, about 10 km from Hassan city, in Hassan district of Karnataka state, India.Foekema (1996), pp81-82 The temple was built in 1200 A.D. during the reign of Hoysala King Veera Ballala II.Foekema (1996), p82 According to art historian Gerard Foekema, the two temples that are built in the same complex, in an idyllic rural setting, form a \\"perfect twin\\".Foekema (1996), p81 This temple complex is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.  Architecture  By plan, the temples are simple single-shrined structures with all the standard features of Hoysala architecture; a porch entrance into a square closed mantapa or navaranga (hall with no windows and a thick wall) leading to the sanctum, and a superstructure (shikhara) over the main shrine fitting the description of a ekakuta (single shrine with top). The sanctum (garbhagriha) is connected to the hall by a vestibule called sukhanasi. The closed hall, whose inner and outer walls are decorated, has four central lathe turned pillars that support a bay ceiling.Foekema (1996), p22Kamath (2001), p134Kamath (2001), p135 The temples are constructed next to each other. The Nageshvara temple (lit, \\"Lord of snakes\\"), dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva (represented by his universal symbol, the linga) is in the south. The Chennakeshava temple (lit, \\"beautiful Vishnu\\"), dedicated to a standing cult image of the Hindu god Vishnu, is to the north. Since all features are replicated in the temples, Gerard Foekema considers the ensamble a dvikuta (two shrines with two towers).Foekema (1996), p82Foekema (1996), pp19-20Foekema (1996), p25 The superstructure (tower or shikhara) over each shrine is three tiered (tritala arpita) and vesara in style. It is intact, finely sculptured and has a decorative low extension which is actually the tower over the vestibule (that connects the cella (sanctum) and the hall). The extension tower looks like the \\"nose\\" of the main superstructure and is also called sukhanasi. The sukanasi structure holds the beautiful Hoysala crest that depicts a royal warrior stabbing a lion. At the top of the superstructure of the shrine is a \\"helmet\\" like sculptured dome (amalaka) whose ground surface area can be 2x2 meters. It is the largest piece of sculpture in the temple. The amalaka supports a decorative water pot like structure called the kalasha which is the apex of the tower.Foekema (1996), p27 All these features are intact in both temples. The decorative features found on the temple outer wall (horizontal treatment) belong to the \\"old kind\\". In this type of decorations, below the superstructure, an eaves that projects about half a meter runs all around the temple. Below the eaves are decorative miniature towers (aedicula) on pilasters. In the \\"old kind\\", the large wall images of deities and their attendants are placed below these decorative towers. Some of these images appear damaged, but there are others that require special mention for their elegance and art. The panel images at the Nageshvara temple have their names on their pedestals.

It caters to the premium Nitromethane burning 300 inch long Dragsters. The class uses large-capacity, supercharged V8 engines with a displacement of 500 cubic inches. Identical to the Top Fuel class of the American NHRA. Top Fuel in Australia is regulated by ANDRA, and is considered a Group 1 or professional category. Top Fuel Dragsters are the fastest accelerating vehicles in the world. These are the most recognisable of all Drag Racing cars. The 25-foot-long Top Fuel dragster can cover the quarter mile in 4.4 seconds at up to 540 kilometres per hour. Mostly using a 4130 chrome moly chassis constructed in the USA. They weigh about 1000 kg which makes for a massive power to weight ratio. The total finished cost of a Top Fuel dragster is estimated at $500,000. Some notable drivers competing in this category are Darren Morgan, Andrew Cowin, Phil Lamattina, Damian Harris, Wayne Newbey, Martin Stamatis and Phil Read and various drivers representing Santo Rapisarda. Some notable crew chiefs include Bruce Read (Jim Read Racing), Robert Cavagnino (Rapisarda Auto sport International) Santo Rapisarda JNR (Rapisarda Auto Sport International) and Santino Rapisarda (Rapisarda Auto Sport International) The nitro burning 11000+ horse-powered Top Fuel dragsters. Top Fuel is the elite Drag Racing category, known as the “Kings of the Sport”. The dragsters that race within this category are capable of covering a quarter mile from a standing start in as little as 4.5 seconds. They achieve speeds in excess of 530 km/h (330 mph) by the finish line and are the fastest accelerating vehicles on the planet, faster even than a Space Shuttle. The energy and sound these incredible machines generate can be felt through the ground and into your body from the grandstand as they thunder down the track, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale on each pass. In order to exceed 300 mph in 4.5 seconds Dragsters must accelerate at an average of over 4G's. In order to reach 200 mph well before half-track, the launch acceleration approaches 8G's. Each run consumes approximately 100 litres of Nitro Methane. Top Fuel Engines turn approximately 540 revolutions from light to light! Including the burnout the engine must only survive 900 revolutions under load Television broadcasting Top Fuel Championship is on SBS Speedweek and the new SPEED Channel on Foxtel.

In simple terms, self-licensing occurs when people allow themselves to indulge after doing something positive first; for example, drinking a diet soda with a greasy hamburger and fries can lead one to subconsciously discount the negative attributes of the meal's high caloric and cholesterol content. A large subset of this effect, the moral credential effect, is a bias that occurs when a person's track record as a good egalitarian establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. This effect occurs even when the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential. For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or African American person in one setting were more likely to say later, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a Caucasian person. Similar effects also appear to occur when a person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision. Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption. Definitions Researchers Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar describe the phenomena as follows: Similarly, Anna Merritt and colleagues have explained that Group membership It has been found that moral credentials can be obtained vicariously. That is, a person will behave as if they, themselves, have moral credentials, when that person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision. In research that draws on social identity theory, it was also found that group membership moderates the effectiveness of moral credentials in mitigating perceptions of prejudice. Specifically, it was observed that displays of moral credentials have more effect between people who share in-group status. Examples Research suggests that self-licensing affects moral self-regulation and individual behavior in a variety of contexts; for example, it can influence consumer purchases, political opinions, charitable giving, energy policy and home energy use, job hiring, racial attitudes, health-related decision-making, risky sexual behavior, alcohol consumption, and dietary supplement use. Executive summary. Cites . Cites . Washington Post staff writer Michael Rosenwald described the following everyday examples of self-licensing behavior: In a large experience sampling study, Hofmann and colleagues found evidence for moral licensing in people's everyday behavior outside of the lab, noting that \\"committing a moral act earlier in the day was associated with an above-average likelihood of a subsequent immoral act and a decreased likelihood of a subsequent moral act.\\" =Dietary supplement use and unhealthy behavior= A 2011 study published by researchers in Taiwan indicated that people who take multivitamin pills, especially those who believe that they are receiving significant health benefits from supplement use, are more prone to subsequently engage in unhealthy activities. Participants in the study were divided into two groups, both of which were given placebo pills; one group was correctly informed that the pills contained no active ingredients and the other group was told that the pills were multivitamin supplements. Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in \\"hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards\\", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the 'multivitamin' group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. The study's authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthy living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users. The authors advised: Commenting on the implications of the study, Ben Goldacre said: =Consumer purchasing decisions= Researchers Khan and Dhar investigated the influence of self-licensing on consumer decisions regarding the purchase of luxury goods. They reasoned that \\"relative preferences for a luxury option will be higher if people's prior decisions provide a boost to their relevant self-concept\\". Due to the self-licensing effect, \\"a prior intent to be virtuous boosts respondents' self-concepts, thus reducing negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries\\". Furthermore, they predicted that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decision influences their subsequent choices; i.e. the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious. In the study, some participants were first asked to select from a list a charity organizations for which they would willingly volunteer three hours a week. Later, these people—and participants who hadn't been asked to volunteer—were asked whether they would buy designer jeans or an identically priced vacuum cleaner, assuming that they had enough money to buy only one. Participants who were asked to imagine having committed the charitable act before shopping were more than twice as likely to choose the jeans. The authors noted that \\"People don't even have to do good for this effect to happen... Even if they plan to do something good, it will give them a boost in their self-image. Any type of situation where you have guilt involved, you will see this, and so this happens in luxury goods.\\" A study by University of Toronto behavioral marketing professor Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong found that people who bought green products were more likely to cheat and steal than those who bought conventional products. The researchers conducted an experiment in which they asked college students to shop for products online from either an eco-friendly or a conventional store. Each subject was then asked to divide a small sum of money between themselves and a stranger in a paradigm known as the dictator game, in which participants can cheat to make more money. The shoppers from the green store were more dishonest than those at the conventional store, which brought them higher earnings in the game. The authors suggested that the results could be accounted for by the licensing effect, noting that \\"When we engage in a good deed, that gives us a kind of satisfaction. With that self- satisfied feeling can come tacit permission to behave more selfishly next time we have the opportunity\\". The authors added that \\"purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors\\", and concluded: =Energy use= Researchers have invoked the self-licensing effect to explain why consumers who opt for energy-efficient products increase their energy usage so as to offset any potential gains. Energy economist Lucas Davis published a study showing that after getting high-efficiency washers, consumers increased clothes washing by nearly 6 percent. Other studies have shown that people leave energy-efficient lights on longer than conventional lights, and that many people who make their homes more energy efficient turn their heating up and ultimately see no reduction in energy costs. =Political opinions and racial bias= The self-licensing effect was examined by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials. Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron showed that an opportunity to endorse Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election made his supporters more likely to express views that favored Whites at the expense of African-Americans. Cites . Essentially, the endorsement made people feel like they had shown that they were not biased, giving them a license to subsequently express racially prejudicial views. Meta-analyses and replications Three meta-analyses have been published on self-licensing. Two of these meta-analyses suggest that the self-licensing effect might be moderated by culture, and the most recent of these meta- analyses suggest that previous estimates of the effect may be exaggerated due to publication bias (consistent with recent publication of failures to replicate the original finding).

Thornton, in which the author argues that Freud became a cocaine addict and that his theories resulted from his use of cocaine. The book received several negative reviews, and some criticism from historians, but has been praised by authors critical of Freud and psychoanalysis. The work has been compared to Jeffrey Masson's The Assault on Truth (1984). Reception The Freudian Fallacy received a mixed review from Wray Herbert in Psychology Today and a negative review from the psychoanalyst Jeffrey Satinover in Library Journal. The book was also reviewed by Michael Neve in the London Review of Books, the psychoanalyst Anthony Storr in The Times Literary Supplement, and the historian Paul Roazen in the American Journal of Psychiatry, A. J. Fogarty in the British Medical Journal, and was discussed by the psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey in National Review. Herbert wrote that Thornton \\"bitterly resented\\" Freud and his influence. Herbert believed that the book benefited from Thornton's knowledge of 19th-century medical literature and that the work \\"brings to life the research laboratories of Paris and Vienna during neurology's infancy\\", but that its value was undermined by Thornton's willingness to make \\"wild pronouncements without any supporting evidence\\". Satinover wrote that the book suffered from \\"specious neurologic diagnoses and misinterpretations of psychoanalytic theory\\" and that Thornton failed to discredit Freud. Torrey, writing in 1995, commented that Thornton's suggestion that Freud almost certainly continued to abuse cocaine until 1899 had been substantiated by the historian and Freud scholar Peter Swales. The book was criticized by the historian Peter Gay, who described it as \\"a model in the literature of denigration\\", and the historian Roy Porter, who called it \\"tendentious\\". However, it was praised by the psychologist Hans Eysenck and other writers critical of psychoanalysis. The philosopher Todd Dufresne described the book as a notable work on the history of psychoanalysis, and the single best work on Freud's cocaine period. The author Richard Webster called the book interesting. He considered some of Thornton's claims both original and persuasive, and suggested that her detailed review of the medical context within which Charcot and Freud worked contains many neglected insights. However, he found Thornton's discussion of Charcot and hysteria more significant than her argument that Freud's theories were shaped by his cocaine use. He argued that Thornton takes her argument about the organic basis of hysteria too far, and this tended to discredit her more reasonable claims. Webster observed that the book has sometimes been endorsed by feminists. He compared it to Jeffrey Masson's The Assault on Truth, another book marked by hostility to Freud and psychoanalysis. According to Webster, The Freudian Fallacy received negative reviews in The Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books, the latter of which included an accusation of anti-Semitism. He criticized the press coverage that the book received in Britain, calling The Sunday Times Magazine′s treatment of Thornton's claims about Freud's addiction to cocaine sensational and shallow.

It is located at 728 North Centre Street. The current structure was built in 1929. History 1985 Rededication Plaque Mary Queen of Peace Catholic Church, Pottsville, was established in 1920 as a new parish under the direction of Cardinal Dougherty, Archbishop of the Philadelphia Diocese. The new parish, organized by father George Shea was created to serve the faithful of the northern part of the city apostle and the surrounding area. From the humble beginnings in the renovated stable on the former Seltzer property, the parish celebrated mass in a new chapel on August 15, 1920. Dedication for the present Spanish Mission Style Church built on the same property was August 25, 1929, with Cardinal Dougherty laying the cornerstone. From its early days until the present the parish has served as a comparison served as a focal point for many social events since 1961 the church has been a parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown. In July 2008, the Parish was selected to close and consolidate with Saint Patrick's Parish as a result of the Diocese of Allentown's 2008 restructuring of parishes. On August 15, 2012, Holy Mass on the Solemnity of the Assumption of Mary was celebrated for the first time at Mary Queen of Peace since its closure in 2008. The church was filled to capacity with over 300 parishioners wanting to worship at the noon mass and return to the beloved Pottsville Catholic Church. Mary Queen of Peace Parochial School The Mary Queen of Peace Parochial School was a coeducational Catholic grade school part of the Mary Queen Parish. The school first opened in fall 1925 after rectors of the city's two original parishes, St. John the Baptist Church, Pottsville, PA and St. Patrick's noticed that overcrowding and distance were negative factors for those residing in the Fishbach and Jalappa dential districts. A letter written by Cardinal Dougherty in 1919 directed that a new parish be established with land being purchased at Center and Nichols Street. The temporary location of the mission church was located at nearby Mt. Laffee. Once the debt financing the construction of the main church and the purchasing of the rectory was established, discussions began on plans to open a parochial school as well as a convent for the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary who would serve as the faculty. An original home in the complex was remodeled and enlarged with a second property converted into the convent. The school opened in September 1925 After 41 years of service, the school was no longer able to meet safety standards as the building deteriorated with age. Considerable renovations and modifications would have been needed in order for the facility to remain in compliance. Rather than move forward with the renovations, the diocese determined demolition would be more cost effective. Approximately 180 pupils were transferred to St. John the Baptist School on the 900 block of Howard Avenue after a meeting with Rev. Charles McNulty of Mary Queen of Peace and Rev. Francis J. Fox of St. John's. The school was closed on June 15, 1966.

How it works Squeaky toy in the shape of a submarine sandwich When the toy is squeezed, air is forced through the squeaker, resulting in a high-pitched sound, such as a squeak, or the sound of a toy horn or whistle. The tone and duration of the sound may depend on the size of the squeaker, the amount of air squeezed out of the toy, and the speed with which it is squeezed. When the toy is not being squeezed, it resumes its normal shape and re-inflates. Air returning into the toy through the squeaker may or may not make a sound, depending on the design of the squeaker and the speed at which air re-enters. The high-pitched noise produced by squeaky toys quickly attracts the attention of infants and small children, while their soft, squeezable nature makes them safe for young children to handle. Squeaky toys are also popular with pets, and examples shaped like bones or small furry animals are commonly marketed for dogs. History The first squeaky toys were simple rubber balls which produced a high pitched noise when air was squeezed through a hole, without a special noise maker. Later examples contained a metal noisemaker known as a \\"whistle disk.\\" Brightly colored rubber squeaky toys molded in various shapes became common during the 1940s. Later examples were molded from durable vinyl, and plastic squeakers replaced metal whistles.L. H. MacKenzie, Squeaky Toys: A Collector's Handbook & Price Guide (Schiffer Publishing, 1998). Squeaky toys may be modeled after popular cartoon characters, or used as promotional advertising. There are squeaky toy collectors, and published guides with typical selling prices. Nature's squeaky toys A western kingbird. Small animals are sometimes compared with squeaky toys. A particularly apt example is the desert rain frog, the subject of a widely viewed video titled \\"World's Cutest Frog,\\" regularly described as making a noise like a squeaky toy. The resemblance is enhanced by the fact that the frog vocalizes by inflating its body, and then exhaling (relatively) large quantities of air, as if being squeezed.Dean Boshoff, World's Cutest Frog – Desert Rain Frog, February 13, 2013. The calls of certain birds have also been compared to squeaky toys; in particular those of the western kingbird, Mississippi kite, and sulphur-bellied flycatcher of North America, and the blue nuthatch of southeast Asia. In popular culture Several squeaky toys play prominent roles in Pixar's Toy Story movies. The three-eyed alien toys first encountered in the claw machine at Pizza Planet are squeaky toys; they appear in all four films, and rescue the other toys from an incinerator in Toy Story 3. Another squeaky toy character is Wheezy, a penguin with a broken squeaker in Toy Story 2. Consigned to a yard sale, his rescue by Woody sets in motion the remainder of the movie's plot. Henry Dagg used squeaky toys in the shape of cats to build a \\"katklavier\\" (cat organ). This unusual instrument came to public attention in 2010, when Dagg used it to perform Over the Rainbow at a charity event held by Prince Charles. Both the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall were reduced to tears of laughter by the performance.Dan Wood, Over the Rainbow by Henry Dagg on his Katklavier (Cat Organ), Sept. 13, 2010.

The boundary of the ancient woods marks the county boundary between Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. History Left in ancient times to Trinity College, Cambridge, the site was clear-felled during the early stages of World War I to supply local industry. Left unplanted between the wars, the grounds were used as a British Army camp and training grounds during World War II. In September 1943 No. 239 Squadron RAF had moved to RAF Ayr to train as a night fighter unit, and re-equipped with the De Havilland Mosquito. It then moved to RAF West Raynham, Norfolk to join No. 100 (Bomber Support) Group, participating in night time operations against enemy Nazi- Luftwaffe fighters. On 27 October 1944 during fighter affiliation training with No. 49 Squadron RAF, a Mosquito piloted by F/Lt J.H.Roberts and accompanied by Flight Engineer Sgt. A.M.Ashcroft, stalled and crashed in the woods, with the immediate death of both pilot and passenger. After the cessation of hostilities, in late 1945 the woods were bought by the newly formed Forestry Commission. Along with a lot of woodland within the River Trent valley, in the 1950s the site was extensively replanted with both Scots and Corsican pine, chosen to supply local industry. Present Now a managed working forest under the care of the Forestry Commission, surveys in 2004 found that the wood dated back at least 400 years, making it a designated ancient woodland. While many visitors are attracted by the Victorian era- plated Rhododendrons which are found throughout the wood at heights of up to , the Forestry Commission and North Kesteven council have agreed to a 50-year plan to restore the forest to its original broad-leaf tree state. Initial clearance of a area yielded a resultant crop of purple flowering heather, which germinated from seeds that had been buried for over 70 years. Leisure The Forestry Commission carpark , provides access to a marked circular walk, which takes 30-40mins at a leisurely pace to complete. The car park can be access from Coddington Lane, and is sign posted off of this road whilst travelling through the wood. The Real Badlands The woods were the main backdrop for the 2009 documentary film The Real Badlands produced by Current TV and Rockwood Pictures, by British filmmakers Tim Clark and Craig Ford. The film tells the story of a Newark-on-Trent couple (Simon Burgess and Susan Moran), who fed up with modern day life, quit their jobs, sell all of their possessions, and move into the woods. The film was shot in the woods and Kelham, near Newark, during the summer and winter of 2008.Lucy Millard, Newark Advertiser, Feb 13, 2009. After release the film was controversial, due to claims that the film was in fact a mockumentary. The filmmakers publicly denied these claims in a written statement read out live on Current TV, minutes after the film was broadcast.Stew Game, Current TV, Live Broadcast 2009. Controversy In July 2012, the woods made national headlines after the Forestry Commission cleared undergrowth within the woods, which were said to be attracting large numbers of doggers, scaring families and ramblers. Police patrols by both Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Police were increased, and carparks closed by North Kesteven at night with warning signs applied.

Based in Lincoln, Nebraska, he is sometimes nicknamed the \\"Farm Belt Fuehrer\\" due to his rural origins.Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, Warner Books, 1997, p. 246 Overview Gary Lauck was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 12, 1953 to a German-American family. At age eleven, he moved to Lincoln, Nebraska with his family, his father becoming a professor of engineering at the University of Nebraska. Lauck skipped his senior year of high school and then attended the University of Nebraska for two years. By this point, he already held neo-Nazi beliefs. In 1978, he shot and wounded his brother Jerry after a political dispute. Eventually, Lauck moved to Chicago, where he would spend most of his adult life.Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism in Modern American History, ABC-CLIO, 2011, p. 110. Lauck has lived in Fairbury, Nebraska since 2009; prior to that he lived in Lincoln, Nebraska. As leader of the NSDAP/AO he was in close contact with like-minded individuals and groups in Europe, notably Michael Kühnen with whom he worked closely from the 1970s. His contacts with the German neo-Nazi scene had begun in 1971 when as an 18-year-old Lauck had established the Auslandsorganisation (overseas organisation) of the National Socialist Combat Groups, a militant German neo- Nazi group that was quickly banned by the German government. Lauck's NSDAP/AO was established following this ban.Toe Bjorgo & Rob Witte, Racist Violence in Europe, St Martin's Press, 1993, p. 86 A noted Germanophile, Lauck sported a toothbrush moustache and used the Nazi salute as his regular greeting. His speech impediment has been often confused with an affected German accent. Although based in the USA, Lauck spent much of his time as an activist in Europe, particularly during the early 1990s when the NSDAP/AO extended its network of contacts considerably. He produced large volumes of neo-Nazi literature in several languages and also dealt in computer discs detailing the building of bombs, both of which were distributed across a network of European contacts. In 1990 he ensured that the NSDAP/AO would link up with the Swedish neo-Nazi group Sveriges Nationella Forbund, which became instrumental in forming the \\"Nordic National Socialist Bloc\\" with like-minded activists in Norway. That same year he played a leading role in helping Kühnen, Gottfried Küssel and Christian Worch establish a network of Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front cells across the former East Germany following German reunification.Bjorgo & Witte, Racist Violence in Europe, pp. 89-90 Two years later the NSDAP/AO also concluded an agreement with the National Socialist Movement of Denmark, which up to that point had been a leading organisation within the rival World Union of National Socialists (WUNS). The change occurred after Povl Riis-Knudsen, a leading figure in WUNS, had been expelled from the Danish Nazi movement for marrying a Palestinian woman.Bjorgo & Witte, Racist Violence in Europe, p. 87 During the early days of the Yugoslav Wars Lauck's journal New Order ran a series of articles in support of Croatia and they particularly expressed support for the Ustaše and the magazine was instrumental in recruiting neo-Nazi linked mercenaries to fight for the Croatian cause.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, pp. 297-298 Lauck was arrested in Denmark in 1995, leading to a far right campaign in the USA against plans to extradite him to Germany, where he was wanted for distributing neo-Nazi propaganda.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 343 Nevertheless, Lauck was deported to Hamburg where he was tried and found guilty of distributing neo-Nazi pamphlets. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 378 He was released on March 19, 1999 and deported back to the United States. Lauck runs Third Reich Books which continues to distribute Nazi paraphernalia online.

They can be used to facilitate the appearance of virtual objects, games, and animations within the real world. Like the earlier ARToolKit system, they allow for video tracking capabilities that calculate a camera's position and orientation relative to physical markers in real time. Once the camera's position is known, a virtual camera can be positioned at the same point, revealing the virtual object at the location of the ARTag. It thus addresses two of the key problems in Augmented Reality: viewpoint tracking and virtual object interaction. An ARTag appears on the Mars Science Laboratory.

Klineman and Mihai Nadin, 2012, lx + 472 pp., Springer, New York is a book by Robert Rosen, conceived in the 1970s and published for the first time in 1985. The book describes the way that biological systems anticipate the environment. The book draws from mathematics, in particular category theory, in describing the way systems can anticipate. The first five chapters of the book are about modeling: Rosen shows that natural systems, physical things in the world, are modeled by formal systems, which are at their heart mathematical. These formal systems simulate the natural systems. But in order to provide anticipatory knowledge, they must produce predictions ahead of the predicted phenomena.  Publication History  The first edition of Anticipatory Systems was published in 1985 by Pergamon Press. The second edition of Anticipatory Systems was published in 2012 by Springer.  Publication details  The second edition includes a fifty-page prolegomena by Mihai Nadin, as well as contributions by Judith Rosen and John J. Kineman. The book is the 27th volume in the International Federation for Systems Research International Series on Systems Science and Engineering, a series edited by George Klir.  Critical reception  A review E. Minch, A Review of Anticipatory Systems, International Journal of General Systems, 1986 by Eric Minch of the first edition called the book \\"radical and profound\\".

Errata for the first edition  Conjunction and disjunction terms are reversed in the text, pages 60–68, but the mathematical expressions are correct. Footnote 8 missing from page 384: probably the reference on 382 should be to footnote 7. Pages 327 and 328 are swapped.

Djajakusuma and adapted by Asrul Sani from the folktale of the same name. It follows a young boy who forgets his roots after spending much of his childhood at sea. Starring Rano Karno, Putu Wijaya, and Fifi Young, Plot Malin (Rano Karno) is a young boy who lives in Sumatra with his mother (Fifi Young) and sister; his father had disappeared at sea several years earlier. When a group of pirates land at the village, Malin catches the eye of their leader, Nakoda Langkap, who takes the boy as his own. As they are leaving the village, they pass the ship of another pirate, the slaverunner Nakoda Hitam. Nakoda Langkap and his men take the ship, wounding (evil pirate captain) and freeing the slaves. One, a boy named Lalang, is orphaned when his mother is killed in the battle; Nakoda Langkap takes him in as a son too. Nakoda Langkap raises the boys to be good sailors and respect others. He also honours his promise to Malin's mother, bringing the boys back to visit her after a hundred full moons have passed. The now-adult Malin (Putu Wijaya) is pleased to see his mother, promising that he would rather turn to stone than forget her, and Malin's sister falls for Lalang. As they leave the village, they once again run across Nakoda Hitam. In the ensuing battle, Nakoda Langkap is killed and Nakoda Hitam is captured. Malin, now the leader, promises to spare Nakoda Hitam in return for the location of his buried treasure. Upon receiving the information, Malin surrenders Nakoda Hitam to the police then smiles when the pirate is hanged. Malin turns out to be a cruel leader, drastically different than his adoptive father. While Lalang and the lieutenant look on, Malin follows one of Nakoda Hitam's men to his secret island refuge, where he kills all present – including women. Although Malin finds the treasure, including a golden throne, several of his men rise against him, including Lalang; they are banished to the sea in a small boat, eventually landing in Malin's village. Several years later, Malin has become a rich man and is married to a Chinese princess. When they are sailing near the village, Malin's wife asks for coconut water and to stretch her legs; reluctantly they put ashore, where Malin is accosted by his mother and Lalang. When he denies that she is his mother, the villagers and Malin's men fight. As Malin and his wife escape, a storm breaks out and the ship collapses. The following morning, as Malin's mother weeps, they discover that Malin has become stone. Production Malin Kundang was written by Asrul Sani, who adapted a Minang folktale of the same name. However, the film changed several aspects of the folktale, such as the ending. In the original story, Malin had turned to stone after his mother cursed him; however, Sani considered it illogical for a Muslim mother to curse her son, no matter what his sins. Funding for the film came from Elly Yunara, the wife of the recently decease film producer Djamaluddin Malik. Her production house, Remadja Ellynda Film, produced the film. It was directed by D. Djajakusuma, who had previously had experience in adapting part of the Mahābhārata in Bimo Kroda (1967). Cinematography was handled by Kasudllah, while editing was done by Soemardjono and music was supplied by Frans Haryadi. Rano Karno, son of the actor Sukarno M. Noor, was cast as a young Malin. He attended the audition with his friend Itang Yunasz and, displeased with the changes to the story, blurted out \\"That's not how the story goes.\\" Djajakusuma was impressed and immediately cast him; it was Karno's first film role. Putu Wijaya – better known for his work in theatre – was cast as the adult Malin. Fifi Young, who had been active in film since 1940, was chosen as Malin's mother. Release and reception Malin Kundang was released in 1971. The Indonesian film critic Salim Said wrote that the first portion of the story was well-done, considering Rano Karno perfect for young Malin and the story well put together. However, he considered the choice of Wijaya to be a poor one, as the actor did not resemble Rano Karno in the slightest.

Fictional character biography =Marcel Mannequin= Marcel Mannequin, as he appears in the pages of Plastic Man #10. The first character to use the name \\"Dollmaker\\" was Marcel Mannequin, an extremely talented dollmaker who uses his own sentient mechanical dolls to commit crimes. He fought against Plastic Man at the time when he had previously given a blood transfusion to Gordon K. Trueblood. Plastic Man managed to defeat Dollmaker at Madame DeLute's high society party.Plastic Man vol. 2 #10 (June 1968) =Anton Schott= Anton Schott as the Dollmaker II. Anton Schott was the son of Winslow Schott, A.K.A. Toyman, and born on Christmas day. His father saw little interest in his son, whom he considered uninteresting despite Anton showing great promises as a skilled toymaker. Anton's mother took him away on the belief that Winslow was a pedophile but only to abandon him, leaving him to fend for himself in Metropolis. Anton soon found his father's old workshop and decided to make a name for himself as the Dollmaker. Driven by abandonment issues, Anton started kidnapping other children and turning them into cybernetic doll-like slaves. Anton later became obsessed with Daily Planet reporter Cat Grant, who was the mother of a victim killed by Toyman, and planned on becoming her son. He sent a doll to Grant for every time a child was kidnapped by Dollmaker. Grant, along with Supergirl, initially mistook Toyman as being responsible for the missing children and confronted him at his incarceration in Arkham Asylum. They unwittingly brought one of Dollmaker's dolls to his father at which point it came to life and nearly killed Toyman. Dollmaker soon personally confronted Grant and kidnapped her to his workshop. There, he told her of his origins and asked her to be his new mother. But Cat violently rejected him, infuriating Anton and causing him to decide on shutting down all his enslaved doll- children, which would kill them. However, Cat cried out for Supergirl's help, who immediately raided Dollmaker's workshop and disarmed the dolls. Cat personally knocked out Dollmaker and left him to be taken away by the authorities.Supergirl (vol. 5) #59 (February 2011) =Barton Mathis= Barton Mathis as the third Dollmaker In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Barton Mathis is introduced as a new \\"Dollmaker\\". As a child, Mathis went on several \\"hunting trips\\" with his father, Wesley.

After spending only a year in foster care, Mathis disappeared for years before he resurfaced as the Dollmaker,Detective Comics (vol. 2) #3 (January 2012) a serial killer who creates \\"dolls\\" out of the skin and limbs of his victims, whose mask is partially made of skin from his deceased father. Despite the ambiguity surrounding his whereabouts, it would later be revealed that Barton Mathis sees the Toyman as a father figure, who was at one point a member of the Dollmaker \\"family\\".Catwoman (vol. 4) #12 The Dollmaker first appeared in current continuity during the Faces of Death storyline when he visited the Joker in Arkham Asylum. The Joker had planned to be caught and taken to Arkham for the sole purpose of having an audience with the Dollmaker. As planned, the Dollmaker cuts the skin from the Joker's face leaving the madman ecstatic with the pain. That night they celebrated believing themselves to be reborn.Detective Comics (vol. 2) #1 (November 2011) Upon tracking Ray Quimby, a serial killer associated with Wesley Mathis, to a location while believing Quimby kidnapped Commissioner James Gordon, Batman is ambushed by the members of the Dollmaker's \\"family\\" (members including Matilda Mathis, Bentley, Jack-in-the-Box, Sampson, Olivia Carr, and Orifice). Batman then encounters the Dollmaker who has brought in what appears to be Commissioner Gordon.Detective Comics (vol. 2) #2 (December 2011) As Batman crawls towards Commissioner Gordon, he discovers that the body is simply a \\"doll\\" of human body parts stitched together to resemble Commissioner Gordon. The Dollmaker announces his plans to make a doll of Batman's flesh and then sell it off to the highest bidder. Naturally, Batman resists and is forced to fight all of the Dollmaker's family with rapidly spreading paralysis in his body. With Jack-in-the-Box clinging to his back, Batman desperately leaps out a window in order to escape becoming too vulnerable in front of his enemy. Struggling to stand, he escapes while dragging the now unconscious Jack-in- the-Box with him. At an abandoned hospital, a kidnapped Commissioner Gordon overhears his captor, the Dollmaker, explaining that he plans to remove his liver before beginning the doll process, because he must save a life before his can be taken. He expresses an interest in filming the procedure, as he has a personal vendetta against Gordon for killing his father. Commissioner Gordon is unaware of who Dollmaker is talking about, but Dollmaker tells Gordon that he is staring his own victim in the face - suggesting that the skin making up his new face actually belonged to Wesley Mathis. When Batman arrives at the hospital upon receiving a message from the Dollmaker, Batman hears the Dollmaker's voice and is attacked by Bentley who chokes Batman into unconsciousness. When Batman awakens in a makeshift boxing ring, the Dollmaker then begins to auction Batman who is hanging upside down near some Joker Dolls. Suspended like a marionette, Batman is forced to fight the Joker Dolls when a crook named Raju arrives at the Dollmaker's lair to offer the Dollmaker a large sum of money in exchange for Batman. Raju's client is the Penguin who plans to pay Dollmaker some gold bars in exchange for Batman's body. The Dollmaker uses magnetized cables to immobilize Batman completely, and Batman is surprised to realize that the cables are of his own design as the Dollmaker has somehow gained access to Wayne Corp. Regardless, he uses a demagnetizer in his suit to free himself, leaping forward and knocking Penguin's thugs out. Freed, he easily defeats the Joker Dolls and begins his search for the Commissioner. Meanwhile, the Dollmaker receives a call from an unseen benefactor who warns him that the GCPD are on their way. The benefactor orders that Commissioner Gordon be killed. The Dollmaker and Matilda make their escape while his thugs Bentley and Sampson gather all the organs and body parts they can salvage. Meanwhile, Batman begins kicking down every door in the hospital, in search of Gordon. Batman defeats Bentley and Sampson and finds the Commissioner and Olivia Carr as they get to safety. Seeing the Dollmaker escaping in a car, Batman leaps down onto the roof crushing it down around him. Unexpectedly though, the car explodes. When Batman investigates, he discovers that the car was filled with decoy dummies that he had mistaken to be the Dollmaker and that the real Dollmaker must have escaped in the police chopper.Detective Comics (vol. 2) #4 (February 2012) During the Death of the Family storyline as Batman travels through the Joker-controlled Arkham Asylum, he discovers a twisted \\"royal tapestry\\" created for him as a \\"tribute from [his] faithful\\", made entirely of living bodies sewn together, kept alive via tubes in their stomachs. The Joker tells Batman that it was made \\"with a little help from the Dollmaker.\\"Batman (vol. 2) #16 The Dollmaker is later found by the Joker's Daughter, who asks him to sew the Joker's face onto her own and inject the Joker's blood into her veins.

Prior to taking up the name \\"Dollhouse\\", Matilda had a doll mask grafted on top of her face and wore a nurse's outfit, killing her victims with a sledgehammer. Eventually, Matilda began to join her father in his organ trading business. When the Dollmaker kidnapped the Batman, though, the business started to go wrong. Following the events of the \\"Faces of Death\\" storyline, Matilda was forced to retreat and go into hiding with her father.Detective Comics (vol. 2) 1–4. DC Comics. Some time after Batman's defeat of the Dollmaker family during the \\"Faces of Death\\" storyline, Matilda Mathis began to follow in the footsteps as her father, Barton Mathis, taking on the identity of \\"Dollhouse.\\" As Dollhouse, Matilda adopted Barton Mathis' modus operandi as the Dollmaker. Dollhouse kidnapped homeless children, prostitutes and junkies of the streets of Gotham City and took them back to her facility. At her facility, Dollhouse would spend weeks nursing her kidnapping victims to their peak healthy condition before killing them and selling their organs for the Dollmaker's organ trade business. Dollhouse would then stuff the remainder of the corpses and turn them into human dolls, putting them on display in her garden.Catwoman (vol. 4) #10. DC Comics. As she continued to kidnap people off the streets, she drew the attention of Catwoman. Catwoman, who grew up on the streets of Gotham, took these kidnappings personally and began investigating them. In doing so, she ran into Dollhouse several times during her attempted kidnapping spree and, while she was able to save some of the potential victims, she failed to defeat Dollhouse during each encounter due to Dollhouse's heavy artillery and military grade weaponry.Catwoman (vol. 4) #10-11. DC Comics. With the help of GCPD Detective Carlos Alvarez, Catwoman was eventually able to track down the location of Dollhouse's facility and, after a confrontation, Catwoman, Alvarez and Batman were able to free Dollhouse's remaining victims and end her kidnapping spree. Dollhouse managed to evade capture, however. Powers and abilities The first Dollmaker uses dolls that he can control. The second Dollmaker is a talented inventor with a genius-level intellect who can use dolls that he has modified into mobile weapons. The third Dollmaker is a gifted surgeon known for creating dolls made of human flesh. He is skilled enough to make the dolls almost perfectly resemble specific human beings when he has the right pieces of flesh. The Dollmaker also has some access to Wayne Enterprises technology and resources, as shown when he went against Batman. In the Faces of Death story arc, Matilda Mathis is shown to be quite agile and to be in possession of a sledgehammer that she uses as a weapon against opponents.Detective Comics (vol. 2) #2 As Dollhouse, Mathis uses heavy artillery and military grade weapons such as grenades and machine guns. Mathis is also a somewhat skilled surgeon.Catwoman (vol. 4) #7-12 In other media =Television= * The Dollmaker appears in the Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show episode \\"The Case of the Dreadful Dolls\\", voiced by Frank Welker. This version of the character creates voodoo dolls that allow him to control the people in whose likenesses they are made, in this case, the Super Friends. His hideout is in Shott's Toy Factory. In the DVD commentary, it is stated that the show's producers created the Dollmaker to be used in the episode in lieu of Toyman who was not available to them. * Barton Mathis appears in the Arrow episode \\"Broken Dolls\\", played by Michael Eklund. Mathis is portrayed as a serial killer who murders young girls by pouring \\"a flexible polymer\\" into their throats, which hardens and suffocates them. He subsequently dresses and poses the bodies in the manner of a bisque doll, prompting the police force and media to nickname him 'The Dollmaker'. Detective Quentin Lance had imprisoned Mathis six years before the episode and is determined to recapture him after his escape from Iron Heights Penitentiary during the Undertaking. Quentin contacts Arrow and they work together to capture him, but he manages to escape a trap Lance and Team Arrow set. Mathis later kidnapped Lance and his daughter Laurel and attempted to turn Laurel into a doll with Quentin watching, but Arrow shows up and saves the Lances. Barton threatens to turn the vigilante Canary into a doll as well. The Canary, who is secretly Quentin Lance's long- lost daughter Sara Lance, kills Barton in retaliation for attacking her family. In the episode \\"State v. Queen\\", it is revealed that Count Vertigo released the Dollmaker during his own break out of the prison and claimed to be a fan of Mathis's work. Dollmaker visits Fish Mooney as seen in the Gotham episode \\"Everyone Has a Cobblepot\\" * Barton Mathis, renamed Dr. Francis Dulmacher, appears in Gotham portrayed by Colm Feore. This version of the character is described as a \\"mad European scientist\\". He has done various experiments and even found ways of reviving the dead. The Dollmaker was first mentioned in the episode \\"Selina Kyle\\", in which he has two of his minions named Patti and Doug to pose as members of the Mayor's Homeless Outreach Program to kidnap street kids as part of a child-trafficking ring while using Trident Intercontinental Shipping as a front for their smuggling. When the Dollmaker's minions get the street kids, they ship them off to the Dollmaker's lair. Detectives James Gordon and Harvey Bullock end the trafficking ring, however. Through the events of \\"The Scarecrow\\", \\"The Blind Fortune Teller\\", and \\"Red Hood\\", it is revealed that the Dollmaker has been kidnapping and imprisoning people for unknown purposes, among them being Fish Mooney. Mooney eventually learns from the Dollmaker's office manager that they are intended to be used for organ trade and the Dollmaker's surgical experiments. To evade having her eyes used in Dollmaker's experiments, Mooney rips out her left eye with a spoon and steps on it before collapsing. The Dollmaker makes his first physical appearance in the episode \\"Everyone Has a Cobblepot\\", in which he visits an imprisoned Mooney upon learning that she tore out her own eye to avoid being used for organ trafficking. Mooney tells the Dollmaker about her history with Carmine Falcone and attempts to convince him to let her become his partner. To show her the consequences of failing him, the Dollmaker shows her one of his experiments: the former office manager whom he butchered and reassembled with different female body parts. Dollmaker finds it amusing. In order to prove herself to him, Mooney ends a mutiny among the prisoners and secures the release of a guard the prisoners took hostage. After the job is done, the Dollmaker welcomes her to the upper management. Upon looking outside the window, Mooney finds that his facility is on a remote island somewhere off the European coast. The Dollmaker confronts Mooney as she tries to escape and threatens to turn her into one of his patchwork creations. Before he could do that, the unlocked prison cell enabled the other prisoners to get out while knocking out and wounding Dollmaker in the process. =Film= The Dollmaker as he appears in Batman vs. Robin The Dollmaker appears in the animated film Batman vs. Robin, voiced by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. This version of the character is Anton Schott by name with elements of Barton Mathis incorporated into the character. A strong man who was a near-victim of his serial killer father in childhood, Schott wears a broken doll mask and kidnaps children from Gotham City, turning them into cyborg dolls (with modifications like chainsaws implanted on their arms) in an abandoned toy factory. Schott claims that this way, they can never be hurt again. After fighting against Robin (who reluctantly spares his life), he is killed by Talon of the Court of Owls, who rips Schott's heart out and inadvertently frames Robin for the murder when Batman arrives just as Talon left, making Batman think Robin did it until he finds an owl feather as a clue.

She is the wife of Raila Odinga, the former Prime Minister of Kenya. In 2010, The Standard named Odinga, who was one of the first women to head a major Kenyan company, as one of the top the most powerful women in Kenya in 2010. Early life and education Odinga earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Nairobi in 1974 when she was 24 years old. While attending the University of Nairobi, she met her future husband, Raila Odinga, who was an employee of the university's Department of Engineering at the time. The couple married and have four children. Career She worked as a teacher for more than twenty years after graduation. She taught at Kenya High School, an all-girls public school located near Nairobi. Her students included the late Governor of Bomet County, Joyce Laboso. Raila Odinga was imprisoned in 1982 as a political prisoner by the government of President Daniel arap Moi. Ida Odinga largely raised her children herself during those years while working as a teacher. However, Ida Odinga was later expelled from her teaching position by the Kenya African National Union-led government due to Raila Odinga's political opposition. Odinga founded the League of Kenya Women Voters in 1991, which promotes opportunities for women in the political arena. She served as the chairperson of the League. She has also championed a host of other causes, many focused on women, children and health in Kenya. Odinga has advocated for the prevention of breast cancer and fistulas, and eradication of the chigoe flea. She has also mentored Kenyan schoolgirls and sat on the board of directors for an organization which aids paraplegics. She became the managing director of the East African Spectre, a liquified gas cylinder manufacturing company, in 2003, becoming one of the first women to head a major Kenyan company. The Standard listed Odinga as one of the top most powerful women in Kenya in 2010. In a 2012 interview with CNN International, Odinga elaborated on her life as a politician's wife. She told CNN's Felicia Taylor, \\"It's good to be a wife, but it's good to be an educated wife. Being a wife, it's just not a position of subordination -- it's a position of strength.\\" In November 2018, Odinga endorsed Bill 2018, which would amend the Constitution of Kenya to guarantee the nomination of female candidates and MPs to Parliament. While she publicly supported the bill, which she said would increase leadership posts for women MPs, Odinga also noted that women had never had the opportunity to compete equally with male politicians in politics. Odinga appeared in Parliament to support sitting women MPs during the debate. However, the bill failed to pass in the National Assembly in February 2019, despite vocal support from Ida Odinga, President Uhuru Kenyatta, and other prominent politicians and activists.

Named after Princess Mafalda of Savoy, second daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III, the ship was completed and entered NGI's South American service between Genoa and Buenos Aires in 1909. Her sister ship had sunk immediately upon launching on 22 September 1907. On 25 October 1927, while off the coast of Brazil, a propeller shaft fractured and damaged the hull. The ship sank slowly in the presence of rescue vessels, but confusion and panic resulted in 314 fatalities out of the 1,252 passengers and crew on board the ship. The sinking resulted in the greatest loss of life in Italian shipping and the largest ever in the Southern Hemisphere in peacetime.Penelope Heckman: Over the Years. (Pittsburgh: Dorrance Publishing, ) p. 9 online. Early history Principessa Mafalda was built at Cantiere Navale di Riva Trigoso with her sister, the . The ship was launched on 22 October 1908 without her superstructure installed in order to avoid the same accident.Raffaele Staiano: \\"Un varo sfortunato\\". Retrieved 10 August 2012. She was finally completed on 30 March 1909 and became the flagship of the NGI. In 1910 she played a part in the development of long distance radio communication when Guglielmo Marconi conducted experiments on board.Russell W. Burns: \\"Communications: An International History of the Formative Years.\\" (London: Institution of Engineering Technology, 2004) . p 460. Specifically designed for voyages between Genoa and Buenos Aires, Principessa Mafalda was considered the best ship on this route for several years, travelling at a relatively rapid 18 knots. Her amenities included a two-story ballroom and spacious cabins in Louis XVI style. On the eve of World War I, 22 August 1914, she made her one and only voyage between Genoa and New York City. During the war she was requisitioned by the Italian Royal Navy and housed officers at Taranto. She resumed her prewar South American service in 1918. She remained the NGI's flagship until 1922, when the assumed the role. By 1926 the Mafalda had made over 90 long but uneventful round trips. On 10 January 1920, the ship was reported missing due to hitting a mine with a full loss of life. Two days later, it sent a radio signal that it was safe and was proceeding as normal. Last voyage and sinking On 11 October 1927 Principessa Mafalda sailed from Genoa for Buenos Aires with intermediate stops scheduled at Barcelona, Dakar, Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Montevideo. The ship was under the command of Captain Simone Gulì with 971 passengers and 281 crew aboard. She also carried 300 tonnes of cargo, 600 bags of mail, and 250,000 gold lire destined for the Argentine government. The trip was to take 14 days. It soon became apparent that the ship was in poor condition. Principessa Mafalda left Barcelona almost a day late due to mechanical problems and several times she slowed to a complete stop on the high seas, sometimes for hours. Water in bathrooms became intermittent.Christopher Ecclestone: The Sinking of the \\"Principessa Mafalda\\" – Portents. (Principessa Mafalda Resource, 2010). Retrieved 10 August 2012. A refrigeration system failure caused tons of food to spoil, resulting in numerous cases of food poisoning. At the stop at Cape Verde, Captain Gulì telegraphed the company to request a replacement vessel, but was told \\"Continue to Rio and await instructions.\\" With the ship resupplied with fresh food and partially repaired, he took her out onto the Atlantic.Bertoldi Silvio: \\"Addio Calma piatt\\". Corriere della Sera. 8 August 1995. Retrieved 10 August 2012. By 23 October Principessa Mafalda had developed a small but noticeable list to port. The passengers, who had received few explanations for the previous breakdowns, now began to worry that the ship was taking on water. Although far behind schedule, she was finally traveling at full steam off the coast of northern Brazil on the 24th. Life aboard then flowed more quietly with the longest part of the journey nearly complete. On crossing the Equator, a line-crossing ceremony was organized on deck with orchestra music and a huge cake.Osvaldo Sidoli: \\"El fin del Principessa Mafalda\\" Historia y Arqueología Marítima. (Buenos Aires: Fundación Histarmar 2008) Retrieved 10 August 2012 Around 17:15 hours on 25 October 1927, near the Abrolhos Archipelago, 80 miles off Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, the ship was rocked by several strong shudders. Passengers were initially assured that this was only due to the loss of a propeller and the situation was not dangerous. However, on the bridge the engineer reported that the starboard propeller shaft had indeed fractured, but it had also traveled off its axis and cut a series of gashes in the hull. Complicating matters, the watertight doors could not be fully closed. At 17:35 Captain Gulì sounded the alarm and ordered the radio officer to send SOS. He also stated this was merely a precaution as he believed his ship could stay afloat until the next day. Two ships, the (British) and (Dutch), arrived quickly. With clear weather and rescue nearby, it seemed that the situation was in hand. However, panic began to spread among both passengers and crew.Associated Press, “Death List of Sea Disaster Mounts to 300, With Many Still Missing - Full Check On Rescue Ships Not Possible - Bravery Displayed by Men of Vessels Which Rushed to Side of Lost Craft - Count 900 Survivors - Scenes Off Brazilian Coast Admitted Long Drawn Out As Well as Harrowing,” The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 28 October 1927, Volume LXI, Number 58, page 2. There are many conflicting versions about what happened next. What is known is that officers had difficulty maintaining order, some passengers were armed, and the ship kept moving forward in a wide circle for at least an hour. Rescue vessels received confusing signals about how to assist. Not all the lifeboats could be launched due to the list, some were rushed by the crowd, and many were not even seaworthy. An Argentinian newspaper claimed that the first lifeboat away was filled almost entirely with crew, including the purser.M Elinder: \\"Every man for himself: Gender, Norms and Survival in Maritime Disasters\\" . Department of Economics Working Paper 2012:8. (Uppsalla: Uppsala Universitet, 2012) p. 30. The rescue vessels, fearing a possible boiler explosion, kept themselves at a distance. A few remaining lifeboats did shuttle between Principessa Mafalda and Alhena, but some were capsized by the panicked throngs. Captain Gulì went down with the ship, and the chief engineer, Silvio Scarabicchi, reportedly committed suicide by shooting himself. Gulì was posthumously decorated for bravery at sea, as were the two radio operators, Luigi Reschia and Francesco Boldracchi, who had remained at their post until they had been drowned. At 22:10, nearly five hours after the initial accident, Principessa Mafalda sank stern first. Since she went down on a busy shipping lane, a number of vessels arrived to assist. By daybreak, Alhena had picked up 450 survivors. rescued 300, Empire Star rescued 202, 151. rescued 122. rescued 49 people, 22 of whom were landed at Bahia. Those rescued by Empire Star were transferred to Formosa and landed at Rio de Janeiro. Many controversies remain about exactly what transpired and who was responsible for the death toll. Reports of gunfire, sharks in the water, exploding boilers, and nearby ships refusing to assist were widely published but never confirmed. Even the exact wreck site remains a matter of dispute today. At the time, the sinking was the largest loss of life on an Italian ship and in the Southern Hemisphere.z Aftermath An investigation by the Italian Navy Board began immediately following the tragedy. It determined that a joint in the propeller casing was to blame for the accident and it ordered that propeller shafts on all Italian-registered vessels be fitted with devices designed to avoid such accidents. It also determined that six lifeboats located on the stern could not be used because of poor placement. Issues of the vessel's age, inadequate maintenance, and the problematic actions of the crew were not investigated. However, the NGI was ordered to pay heavy compensation to the families of victims. A 2012 analysis discovered that while the number of casualties among steerage passengers was indeed high, more first-class passengers died (51.8%) than did steerage class passengers (27.8%).

Life and work  Hupfeld Phonoliszt-Violina Model B music cabinet with three self-playing violins and a self-playing piano Ludwig Hupfeld AG Phonola of 1900 (the Castle Voigtsberg in Oelsnitz / Vogtland.) Hupfeld was born in Maberzell (now Fulda in Hesse), Germany. Hupfeld attended the Royal Grammar School in Fulda and undertook commercial training in Cologne. In 1892 he acquired the music trade company J. M. Grob & Co., based in Leipzig which was originally a music shop and manufacturer of mechanical instruments. After taking over the company, the name was changed to Hupfeld Musical Instrument Works. When the company was converted to a corporation in 1904, the name of the company became Ludwig Hupfeld AG. In 1911, the company moved to Leipzig, to a large factory in Böhlitz-Ehrenberg. Over the years, Hupfeld bought up several construction companies, and in 1925 following a merger with the Zimmerman company, it led the industry in Europe. In the 1920s, Ludwig Hupfeld AG was the largest manufacturer of mechanical musical works in Europe. One of the most popular products since 1902 was the self- playing piano Phonola American, the European counterpart of the pianola. Hupfield had some success with the 1908 reproducing piano DEA, which later took over the role as Triphonola successfully. The mechanical violin Violina, an orchestrion, despite an ingenious design, was seen as aesthetically unsatisfactory and therefore less successful. During World War II, the company made ammunition boxes and fuel tanks in the factory. At the end of the war, as an ex-arms manufacturer, it was made a state-owned enterprise by the communist authorities of East Germany in 1949. The company was renamed VEB Deutsche Pianounion and continued to produce pianos under the brand name Hupfeld. Hupfeld died in Leipzig on 8 October 1949, and was buried in the Leipzig South Cemetery in his family tomb, where he was joined in 1953 by his wife Elisabeth (née Beyer, born 1874).

The agency's purpose is to protect student interests and the reputation of Australia's higher education sector through a proportionate, risk-reflective approach to quality assurance that supports diversity, innovation and excellence. All organisations that offer higher education qualifications (diploma or above) in or from Australia must be registered by TEQSA. Higher education providers that have not been granted self-accrediting authority must also have their courses of study accredited by the agency. Australian universities have self-accrediting authority and are not required to have their courses accredited by TEQSA. The Australian higher education sector includes public and private universities, Australian branches of overseas universities, TAFEs, government agencies, professional bodies, faith- based colleges and other independent for-profit and not-for-profit providers.  Operational activities  The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (TEQSA Act), calls the agency to: * Register regulated entities as higher education providers and accredit their courses of study * Assess the compliance of registered higher education providers with the Higher Education Standards Framework * Provide advice and make recommendations to the Commonwealth Minister responsible for Education on matters relating to the quality and regulation of higher education providers * Cooperate with similar agencies in other countries * Collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to higher education providers, higher education awards, quality assurance practice and quality improvement in higher education.  Governance - TEQSA Commission  The TEQSA Commissioners are appointed by the Commonwealth Minister for Education and are responsible for making major regulatory decisions, setting strategic directions, monitoring risk in the sector and deciding on matters relating to the development of the agency's quality assurance and regulatory functions. The Commissioners are TEQSA's accountable authority. The Commissioners are Professor Nick Saunders AO (Chief Commissioner), Emeritus Professor Joan Cooper, Dr Linley Martin and Emeritus Professor Cliff Walsh. The Chief Executive Officer and a team of Senior Managers oversees the work of the agency and supports the Commission. TEQSA's Corporate Plan sets out the agency's activities and priorities, and performance is documented in the Annual Report.  Legal framework  The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (TEQSA Act) calls for TEQSA to regulate higher education using a standards-based quality framework based on principles of regulatory necessity, reflecting risk and proportionate regulation. The Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2015 (HES Framework) applies to all higher education providers. They are the minimum level of achievement that a provider must meet and maintain to be registered to deliver higher education courses of study. TEQSA evaluates the performance of providers against the requirements of this Framework. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (ESOS Act) applies to providers offering higher education courses of study to students in Australia on student visas. TEQSA's responsibilities under the ESOS Act apply to: * Higher education courses * Foundation Programs (except those delivered by schools) * English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) programs delivered under an entry arrangement with a higher education provider. The National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018) provides nationally consistent standards that protect international students. The National Code protects governs courses registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS). Only CRICOS courses can be offered to international students studying in Australia on a student visa. Additional information: Acts and Standards.  National Register of Higher Education providers  TEQSA maintains an online public register, the National Register of all higher education providers and their accredited courses of study. The register is the authoritative source of information on the status of registered higher education providers in Australia.  Australian higher education sector  All providers of higher education registered by TEQSA, through meeting the requirements of the Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2015, become ‘higher education providers’. This title signals that the provider is a bona fide provider of quality higher education in Australia. Higher education consists of awards spanning the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) levels 5-10, which include diplomas, advanced diplomas, associate degrees, bachelor's degrees (including honours), graduate certificates, graduate diplomas, master's degrees, doctoral degrees and higher doctoral degrees.  Approach to quality assurance and regulation  The agency’s regulatory approach is guided by the following three regulatory principles: regulatory necessity, reflecting risk, proportionate regulation. While the TEQSA Act establishes a broad framework for the agency's overall approach to higher education regulation, the core elements are to apply a ‘standards and risk-based quality’ framework to protecting and promoting the interests of higher education students and the reputation of Australia's higher education sector. TEQSA released its first report on risk findings on Australia's higher education sector (July 2019). TEQSA's approach to compliance and enforcement can be found in the publication, TEQSA's approach to compliance and enforcement. Regulatory action commonly ranges (escalates) from TEQSA: # Providing education and support, to # Communication of concerns in writing, to # Requesting information and reporting, to # Imposing conditions on provider's registration and/or conditions on course accreditation, to # Approving registration or accreditation for a period less than the full seven years, to # Cancelling registration.  History  In 2008, the Australian Government initiated a Review of Australian Higher Education to examine and report on the future direction of the sector, its fitness for purpose in meeting the needs of the Australian community and economy, and options for reform. This Review, also known as the Bradley Review, recommended a new, independent national regulatory body be responsible for all types of higher education. The review team decided that a national approach would provide a more effective, streamlined and integrated sector, achieving a sustainable and responsible higher education system. The Australian Government responded to the Bradley Review in 2009, announcing a reform package for higher education. This package expanded the system and was intended to create new opportunities for all Australians to reach their potential in higher education. The Government also committed to ensuring that growth in the sector was underpinned by a robust quality assurance and regulatory framework with an emphasis on student outcomes and the quality of the student experience. TEQSA was established by the Government as Australia's higher education regulation and quality assurance agency in 2011, with a focus on ensuring that higher education providers meet minimum standards, promote best practice and improve the quality of the Australian higher education sector. In 2012, TEQSA assumed regulatory powers under the TEQSA and ESOS Acts. In 2013, following the expression of some concerns from providers about the burden of TEQSA's regulatory approach, the Review of Higher Education Regulation Report was released, and in 2014, a significantly streamlined Revised Risk Assessment Framework was adopted. The Higher Education Standards Framework was reviewed in 2015 and became effective in January 2017. The impact of the TEQSA Act was reviewed in 2016-17 and, in 2019, a bill to implement the recommendations of the review was introduced to the Australian Parliament.  Engagement  TEQSA’s engagement is with all levels of the higher education sector – from current and prospective students, through to higher education providers, peak bodies and international quality assurance agencies. Student engagement activities are focused through the Student Expert Advisory Group. As Australia's national quality assurance and regulatory agency for higher education, the agency is sometimes called on to address sector wide issues that affect students and, in turn, the wider Australian community. TEQSA also accepts complaints about Australian higher education providers to gather information that assists the agency in the regulation of the sector. With responsibility for regulating all Australian higher education, whether offered in Australia or overseas, TEQSA has a network of agreements with the regulatory bodies of those countries in which Australian providers are most active.

The newspaper was published every Saturday until 13 August 1936 when it changed to a Thursday publication day. Up until the establishment of a locally produced newspaper in the Penrith district, Sydney and Parramatta newspapers, such as the Evening News, Cumberland Mercury and Sydney Morning Herald circulated in the local area and carried local news reports. The first newspaper published in Penrith was the short-lived Penrith Argus which commenced in 1881. Newspaper proprietor, William Webb, who was born in the district, had by the 1880s established a number of country papers. He set up his apprentice, a young William Shannon Walker as editor. The Nepean Times was circulated from Rooty Hill (Blacktown) to Springwood (Blue Mountains), Castlereagh to Bringelly. When the Nepean Times ceased publication after eighty years on 29 November 1962, it was not without a great deal of recognition of its lasting importance. It was the only newspaper owned, printed & published in Penrith at the time.  Awards  In 1952, the high standards set by the Nepean Times newspaper was recognised when it was awarded the W.O.

It was published by Dutton in August 2012. Plot The Lost Prince follows the character of Eleanor Burden, an 1890s Boston socialite who has resigned herself to marrying the man she should be with rather than the man she wants, whom she lost in Vienna. What separates her from others of her station and background is that Eleanor believes that she has the ability to predict all of the major historical events that will occur while she is alive. Dismissed as a hysteric, Eleanor must decide whether or not fate is predetermined or if she possesses the ability to change future events as well as her own life. Critical reception Reception for The Lost Prince has been positive and nationwide, with Publishers Weekly praising Edwards' way of \\"connecting historical events and philosophical ideas, and also connecting this book to his first.\\" Kirkus Reviews also praised the novel, saying \\"throughout the novel, Edwards skillfully intertwines Eleanor’s predestined fate with her relationships to Freud, Jung, J. P. Morgan, William James and other historical figures...a powerful, intense and fascinating read.\\" The Los Angeles Times hailed its treatment of \\"big ideas\\" such as destiny, history, the role of the individual, and undying love. According to the Times, “there's no denying the sweetness of unshakable faith that infuses the core of The Lost Prince.”http://seldenedwards.com/content/los-angeles- times The Washington Post described The Lost Prince as “ingeniously plot- driven: Each chapter constitutes a polished short story in which Eleanor pulls off some near-impossible task to bend current events to the dictates of the journal.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: “This is a strange and unique love story. On the heels of Edwards' debut novel, The Little Book, the author has crafted a daring follow-up…the book is a meditation on love, faith, free will and one's purpose in life.” The Deseret News hailed The Lost Prince as “a provocative novel of destiny, free choice and sacrifice...Edwards' novel is a compelling tale of sacrifice in the name of family and love, reminding readers of the importance of each decision they will make throughout their lives, whether significant or trivial.” The Santa Barbara Independent noted that both The Lost Prince and The Little Book “proceed from the premise that Wheeler Burden, Harvard baseball hero, philosopher, and rock star, has the ability to travel back from California in 1988 to Vienna, Austria, circa 1897. The action that follows from this rent in the fabric of time brings together such historical figures as Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, and William James with the Burden clan, who are strictly the product of Edwards’ remarkable imagination.” The North County Times found that “Edwards' love for his characters -- even the frightening J.P. Morgan with his bulbous nose -- is striking and effective. They have blossomed and thrived under the caring, brilliant tutelage of a gifted author, whose enthusiasm seems boundless.”http://www.nctimes.com/entertainment/books-and-literature/books- born-to-teach/article_af32d5f8-4317-5f48-99ee-220a7f4709b6.html Marie Claire Magazine hailed it as a great summer read, saying that \\"With a cast of characters that includes Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and William James, it's like Midnight in Paris for the neurotic set.\\" The Historical Novel Society praised The Lost Prince as \\"entertaining, thought-provoking, and highly recommended.\\" Capital Region Living Magazine found it \\"compelling and fascinating...if you enjoy great story-telling, Selden Edwards is an author you should read.\\"http://www.crlmag.com/articleDetail.cfm?id=498 References External links * The Lost Prince * Official website Category:2012 American novels Category:Novels about time travel Category:Novels set in Vienna Category:Novels set in the 1890s Category:Dutton Penguin books ","title":"The Lost Prince (Edwards novel)"},{"id":"36682368","text":"The I-TEC Maverick is a powered parachute aircraft with a roadable fuselage. prototype flight Design and development Equipped with the largest powered parachute certified by the FAA, the Maverick received experimental aircraft airworthiness certification on April 14, 2008, with N-Number 356MV.FAA N-number registry Capable of interstate speeds on pavement, the Maverick's dune buggy-like frame of chromoly tubing gives it the ability to be used off-road.

The company was previously known as English Electric Valve Company and for a short time Marconi Applied Technologies. e2v was acquired by US company Teledyne Technologies in March 2017. Company history The company began in the early 1940s as a part of the Marconi group, manufacturing magnetrons for defence Radar systems. The company was first registered as a separate company in Chelmsford, Essex in 1947 under Semyon Aisenstein. Its initial name was the Phoenix Dynamo Co Ltd, though it immediately changed its name to English Electric Valve Company Ltd. In 1959 Bob Coulson established travelling-wave tube and microwave tube sections and they were producing ceramic hydrogen thyratrons as well. By this time EEV was the largest hi-tech manufacturing company in the UK. A year later they won an EMMY award for outstanding contribution to electronics technology in developing the 4½\\" orthicon tube. In 1961 they acquired the Associated Electrical Industries valve business based in Lincoln. Sir Charles Oatley was a director of the company from 1966 to 1985.The Papers of Sir Charles Oatley.

Many web application frameworks offer an active record and object-relational mapping features, where external data in serialization formats is automatically converted on input into internal objects and, in turn, into database record fields. If the framework's interface for that conversion is too permissive and the application designer doesn't mark specific fields as immutable, it is possible to overwrite fields that were never intended to be modified from outside (e.g. admin permissions flag). These vulnerabilities have been found in applications written in Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Java Play framework. In 2012 mass assignment on Ruby on Rails allowed bypassing of mapping restrictions and resulted in proof of concept injection of unauthorized SSH public keys into user accounts at GitHub. Further vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails allowed creation of internal objects through a specially crafted JSON structure.

Cla (as he was known) was educated at the High School, Perth, Western Australia and the University of Western Australia (B.Sc., 1926; M.Sc., 1929; D.Sc., 1936). Allen was appointed to a research fellowship at the newly established Commonwealth Solar Observatory in 1926 at Mount Stromlo, Australian Capital Territory, becoming an assistant there in 1928. Allen observed the 1 October 1940 solar eclipse in South Africa and obtained important results on the solar corona, including measurements of its electron density which were to prove invaluable to radio astronomers. Allen accepted an invitation by Sir Harrie Massey in 1951 to become Perren professor of astronomy at University College, London, and director of the University of London Observatory, Mill Hill. Within a few years Allen had built up his observatory into one of the best astronomical departments in England. He published the first edition of Astrophysical Quantities in 1955, a compilation of numerical data of astrophysical interest.

Benjamin Wegner Nørregaard (3 October 1861 – 24 April 1935) was a Norwegian military officer, railway engineer, adventurer, journalist, diplomat and internationally renowned war correspondent. He spent several years in China and served as Minister of Labour in the Tianjin Provisional Government during the Boxer Rebellion. He later worked as a war correspondent for the Daily Mail and for Scandinavian newspapers, and covered several conflicts in East Asia and Europe.

Described as an adventurer, he left the country in 1895 without permission of his military superiors, effectively ending his military career, and in the following years, he lived in East Asia during a period marked by upheavals and war. He worked as a railway engineer for the Imperial Chinese Railways from 1896 to 1900. During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, he was employed by the Allies as head of the Ministry of Labour in the Tianjin Provisional Government, which governed the major city Tianjin and surrounding areas, a position he held from 1900 to 1902. He was also the architect of the new, monumental government building in Tianjin. He rose to journalistic prominence as a war correspondent of the Daily Mail during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) and during the First Balkan War (1912–13). He witnessed the Siege of Port Arthur and published the book The Great Siege: The Investment and Fall of Port Arthur (Methuen Publishing, 1906) and the book War (1908) on the Boxer Rebellion, which were \\"written with great journalistic talent.\\"Omang, Reidar (1959), Norsk utenrikstjeneste II: Stormfulle tider 1913–28.

From 1906 to 1908, he lived in St. Petersburg as a foreign correspondent of the Norwegian newspaper Morgenbladet and the Danish newspaper Vort Land, and gave a vivid portrayal of the revolutionary turmoil in Russia. In 1909, he relocated to Berlin as a correspondent for Morgenbladet. In the same year, he was appointed a \\"secret press envoy\\" to Berlin and Paris for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 1911. From 1911, he was permanently employed by Morgenbladet. He also wrote for the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. During the First World War, he was among the leading commentators on the ongoing war in the neutral countries.Aftenposten Aften 2 October 1926 p. 2Hvem er hvem? 1912 In addition to writing on war and foreign policy, he was a food writer, and wrote humorous short stories.

Department of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1 (2012), was a United States Supreme Court case where the Court ruled that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) gives exclusive jurisdiction for claims under the Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.. Additionally, the Court held that the Act bars federal district courts from ruling on matters related to the act including adverse employment actions of the federal departments, and allows the Merit Systems Protection Board to hear constitutional arguments for wrongful employee severance and adverse employment actions. It was a 6-3 decision, with the majority opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas. The case greatly limited the recourse of federal employees to the courts for adverse employment practices, allowing such recourse only to a few, specific courts as aforementioned. Prior to the Supreme Court Michael B. Elgin and several other employees of the U.S. Department of the Treasury were fired for willingly and knowingly failing to register for the Selective Service, pursuant to , which forbids any federal executive employees who committed such an omission. Elgin challenged his discharge before the Merit Systems Protection Board, claiming such a requirement is unconstitutional being a bill of attainder and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since only males are required to enroll in the Selective Service System. The Merit Systems Protection Board referred the case to an administrative law judge, who dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that an employee is not entitled to Merit Systems Protection Board review of agency action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment. The same administrative law judge also ruled that the Merit Systems Protection Board did not have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes. Rather than appealing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as is required by the CSRA, Elgin and several other petitioners appealed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The court denied Elgin's claims, holding that the act and Elgin's severance was constitutional.Elgin v. United States, 594 F. Supp. 2d 133 (D. Mass. 2009); reconsidered and vacated, 697 F. Supp. 2d 187 (D. Mass. 2010); Elgin appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which ruled that federal district courts have no jurisdiction over the matter.

Situated in the Nile, Meinarti was just north of the 2nd Cataract, a few kilometers upstream of the Sudanese border town of Wadi Halfa. On the island was an artificial mount 175m long and 12.5m high, consisting of stratified archaeological remains. When excavated it proved to contain 18 recognizable levels, the result of six separate and distinct phases of occupation. Each phase was followed by a period of abandonment and then a complete rebuilding. Structural remains at all phases were entirely of mud brick. Meinarti was excavated by William Yewdale Adams from 1962 to 1964, prior to perishing in the 1960s with the rising of Lake Nubia due to the Aswan Dam. The earliest occupation, Phase 1 (= Levels 16-18) occurred during the later, Meroitic phase of the great Nubian empire of Kush. Its beginning coincided more or less with the Roman occupation of Egypt, in 30 BC. The surviving remains included no residences, but three stoutly built public or commercial buildings. The largest was too poorly preserved for definite interpretation. Nearly as large was a walled market compound consisting of shops on either side of a plaza, while nearby was the best preserved wine press ever found in Nubia. It was used only for a short time, and was abandoned and filled with trash well before the end of Phase 1, which seems to have been the result of flood destruction. The remains were entirely sanded over before the beginning of Phase 2 (Levels 13-15), which probably occurred around AD 350. This was a time when the Empire of Kush collapsed, leaving only the somewhat impoverished remnant kingdom of Ballaña in the region around Meinarti. The surviving remains bore no resemblance to those of Phase 1, consisting entirely of a tight cluster of small and irregular peasant dwellings. Like those of earlier times, they were eventually abandoned and sanded over. Christianity was introduced to Nubia in the later fifth century, and Meinarti was reoccupied not long afterward, perhaps around AD 650, at Phase 3 (Levels 11-12). The remains at these levels were extremely poorly preserved, with few walls standing above 40 cm, as a result of repeated flooding. The place appeared to have been once again a peasant village, although there were denuded foundations of a couple of larger and more stoutly built buildings, of undetermined function. Clearly recognizable however were the foundations of Meinarti's first church, which had a flooring of red cobblestones with a white cross pattern in the center. The church as first built had a curiously skewed plan, the corners deviating by more than 15 degrees from a right angle, but it was very soon rebuilt on a more regular plan. Unlike all other buildings at Meinarti it remained in use though successive periods Phases 3-5), with numerous modifications necessitated by constantly accumulating sand. Phase 4 (Levels 7-10) probably began around AD 950. This was a time when Christian Nubia enjoyed especially cordial and prosperous relations with Fatimid Egypt, as is clearly reflected in the archaeological remains. They were once again a tight cluster of peasant residences, but they were notably more spacious than in any earlier period. The typical house had a sizable front room, behind it one or two smaller store rooms, and an L-shaped passage leading beside and then behind the store rooms, and ending in a latrine, with ceramic toilet fixture, at the back of the house. Nothing comparable to this feature has been found from any earlier period in Nubian history. One house was presumably the residence of an important official; its main room was whitewashed and was adorned with a number of protective inscriptions, and it had no fewer than four store rooms. The houses at Phase 4 were far and away the best preserved in the site, with some preserved to the level of the original roofs. The settlement was nevertheless once more abandoned after a century or two, and the houses thereafter completely buried in sand. Phase 5 (Levels 3-6) probably began around AD 1200. This was a time of somewhat disturbed political and military conditions in Egypt and the Near East, due in part to the intrusion of the Crusaders. Christian Nubia was not wholly unaffected, due to the threat of Egyptian invasion as well as to dynastic quarrels. Meinarti assumed a new strategic importance, and became a sometime residence of the Eparch of Nobadia (the viceroy of northern Nubia), although his normal capital was Qasr Ibrim. The archaeological remains at this phase, at any rate, were quite unlike those of any earlier period; they consisted mainly of a sprawling complex of more than 80 contiguous rooms. Most were quite small, but at the center was a complex of large rooms having whitewashed walls, and in one case mural paintings in red, yellow, and black. Most were somewhat abstract in character, and were wholly unlike the numerous paintings found in Nubian churches. None of the rooms, large or small, exhibited any residential features. It seems probable that the whole complex was built for the use of the Eparch, the smaller rooms being stone rooms for goods in transit through the cataract. In addition to the \\"eparchal complex\\" there were three or more ordinary residences. Their design was similar to that of the houses of Phase 4, but they were more stoutly built and were in all cases freestanding, not adjoining any other building. Phase 5 came to an end when, in AD 1365, the Eparch ordered the evacuation of the whole of northern Nubia in the fact of a Mamluk invasion from Egypt. Phase 6 (Level 2) probably began in AD 1400 or later. By this time the southern Christian kingdoms of Makouria and Alwa had been overrun by nomad invaders and disappeared. In the north Nobadia survived as a splinter kingdom, saved from nomad invasion by the total lack of pasturage in the surrounding desert. The one surviving building was a massive mud brick \\"castle-house with high vaulted chambers,\\" originally two stories high though the upper story was mostly cleared off in the nineteenth century. It was one of more than a dozen similar buildings erected in the area at and beyond the Second Nile Cataract, at the end of the Middle Ages. Living arrangements, including toilets, were on the upper floor, while those below were designed entirely for the safe storage of goods. A peculiarity of all these structures was that some (sometimes all) of the ground-floor rooms had no lateral entrances; they could be entered only through the roof. The \\"castle-houses\\" were long supposed to be of Ottoman origin, but the specimen at Meinarti bore a Greek inscription with the names MIXAEL RAPHAEL GABRIEL running in a repeating succession around the walls of one room, clearly attesting a Christian origin. The building and more others like it had however remained in use well into the Ottoman period. Nearly all the \\"castle-houses\\" were built on islands, presumably for added security. At all other sites except Meinarti they were accompanied by more conventional dwellings, which must surely have been the case at Meinarti although none survived. This was the topmost level of the mound, and was subject to continual wind erosion and slumpage. The final abandonment of Meinarti as a Nubian settlement undoubtedly coincided with the end of Christian Nubian civilization, around AD 1500. Around 1890 the Anglo-Egyptian garrison at the nearby town of Wadi Halfa cleared off most of the upper floor of the Meinarti \\"castle-house\\" and installed a gun emplacement. In the course of the excavations this was designated as Level 1. References * William Yewdale Adams: Sudan Antiquities Service Excavations at Meinarti, 1963–64.

The Basques also practiced trade with the Iroquois and Algonquins, one of the first places where the legacy of these two cultures can be seen. These facts were confirmed by archaeological excavations in the 1990s at various locations on the island. The island is home to Basque and Native American sites, four of which are situated along its southern shore. These four sites, or shore camps, resemble similar sites scattered along the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Shore camps not only gave fishermen and whalers a chance to replenish their supplies of firewood and fresh water, but they also provided space to dry their catch of fish. Whalers also used shore camps to process whales and render the blubber into oil. Four single-hearth Basque ovens used in this process have been discovered on the island; two of these ovens were found at l'Anse à la Baleine, the third and fourth at l'Anse Qui Pue and l'Anse d'En Bas, respectively. In the oven at la Baleine, archaeologists discovered evidence of charred blubber and combustion, as well as pieces of terra cotta roof tiles and fragments of European crockery. In addition, archaeologists found two glass beads alongside the Basque artifacts at la Baleine; one turquoise-colored and the other white, both matched descriptions of types of beads known to be traded by Europeans to native peoples. Native American pottery shards and other Basque items have also been found at the other archaeological sites spread out along the southern shore, confirming that the Basques and native peoples frequented these sites at the same time. The last known documentation of Basque presence on the island was made by Jesuit Paul Lejeune in 1637. Although the exact time the Basques stopped frequenting the island is unknown, the 1664 writings of another Jesuit, Father Henri Nouvel, confirm that the Basque occupation of the island bearing their name was by that time a thing of the past. He observed, \\"It [the island] goes by the name of the Isle aux Basques, on account of the whaling which the Basques did there in bygone days. I took pleasure in visiting the large ovens they had built to make their oil, about which we can still see the great ribs of Whales they killed.\\" The island is long and wide, covering an area of . Its highest point has an elevation of in the center of the island. It is located in the physiographic region of the Appalachia, on the south bank of the St. Lawrence opposite the city of Trois-Pistoles, about east of Quebec City. Île aux Basques was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.

He played a prominent role in the law reform lobbies of the 1960s and 1970s. He is the author of many books including Sociological Aspects of Homosexuality (1965) and The Sexual Behaviour of Young People (1965).  Life and work Michael Schofield was born in Leeds in 1919, the fourth child of Snowden Schofield, who was the owner of Schofield's, the largest department store in Leeds for many decades. He obtained a degree in Psychology at Cambridge University, then spent the war years as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force. Schofield flew with a night fighter squadron and openly conducted a homosexual relationship with another pilot. He was the first to be informed when his lover was killed. After the war, he studied at Harvard Business School. During this time, he identified as homosexual and decided to make an original study of the social aspects of homosexuality. At a time when homosexual activity was a criminal offence, publishing under his own name was too risky and he assumed the pen name of Gordon Westwood. This first book, Society and the Homosexual, was published in 1952 and was the first non- medical book to be written about homosexuality, and contemporary with the trials of several prominent people during the 1950s.Peter Wildeblood Against the Law, 1955 In 1960 he published A Minority, the first detailed research into the lives of homosexuals who had not gotten into trouble with the law and who had not sought medical treatment. His third and major study was finally published under his own name in 1965 as Sociological Aspects of Homosexuality. In England little of sociological significance had appeared before this, and his work was regularly cited in the debate over law changes. At this time he also became active in the Homosexual Law Reform Society, working with Antony Grey and others. After these publications he turned his attention to other social issues including single parent families, teenage premarital sex, birth control, abortion, drug taking and prison reform. In 1965 his best known book, The Sexual Behaviour of Young People, was published. This caused a stir, but was also taught in higher education institutions as much for its methodology as its findings. His later books included Social Research (a textbook), The Strange Case of Pot, The Sexual Behaviour of Young Adults, Report of the Committee on the Operation of the Sexual Containment Act. He also wrote many research papers, articles in periodicals and introductions to other books. Schofield spent many years actively supporting various law reform groups. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty) for nine years. He was active in the campaign against censorship and appeared as an expert witness for the defence of several trials in which publications were tried for their alleged obscenity. He also served on the Government Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence (chaired by Barbara Wootton) that published the Wootton Report (the report on cannabis which suggested that the legal penalties were far too severe). He wrote a minority note for it. On a wider scale, he campaigned to make contraceptives free on the National Health Service and for the Abortion Law Reform Association. He was an early supporter of frank sex education, gay rights and a more tolerant attitude to marital infidelity. He was to be found opposing Mary Whitehouse and her supporters on TV and radio on many occasions, but he made few enemies and many friends. Schofield was the founder and main instigator of a charitable foundation named the Lyndhurst Settlement, to which he donated a large part of his inheritance. Between 1968 and 2005, it donated at least three million pounds to small struggling charities, particularly those groups working for civil liberties and for the protection of the environment. Schofield retired in 1985 from public life and lived with his partner (whom he met in 1952), Anthony Skyrme, until his death in 2014.  Contributions  Schofield was amongst the first researchers to approach homosexuality outside of a medical or legal framework. His concern was to investigate homosexual life as it was lived by ordinary homosexuals in everyday life. At the time homosexuality was a criminal offence, and such research was difficult to conduct. Jeffrey Weeks lists him with Donald West as a \\"discreet pioneering homosexual researcher.\\" His first book, Society and the Homosexual (1952) was an overview of the topic including early notes on the gay scene in England at that time. His second book, A Minority, was an original survey study of 127 men, and was the first of its kind. He asked them about their backgrounds, early homosexual experiences, attempts to combat, the extent of their homosexual acts, work and leisure and community integration. The third book, Sociological Asopects of Homosexuality (1965), was a comparative study of heterosexuals and homosexuals along three dimensions: in prison, in treatment and others in the community. He concluded: > Homosexuality is a condition which in itself has only minor effects upon the > development of the personality. But the attitudes not of the homosexual but > of other people towards this condition, create a stress situation which can > have a profound effect upon personality development..... A proportion of > homosexuals are able to withstand this pressure from outside and become > social casualties. These are the homosexuals found most often in prisons and > clinics...... On the other hand the homosexuals who have learnt to contend > with social pressures can become adjusted to their condition and integrated > with the community. These men are hardly ever found in prison and > clinics.Schofield, Sociological Aspects of Homosexuality1965: p203 Ken Plummer in The Making of the Modern Homosexual remarks that: > In England little of sociological significance appeared until 1965. Indeed > it is tempting to suggest that until that time all the sociological > insights, apart from a rather eccentric sociological report prepared for the > Home Office in 1958 by Richard Hauser, grew from the work of one man: > Michael Schofield, writing under the alias, Gordon Westwood. A second major contribution was his work The Sexual Behaviour of Young People (1965). This was one of the earliest surveys of sexual behaviour in the U.K. and looked at the behaviour of young people. Five years later the same people were re-interviewed for a follow up in The Sexual Behaviour of Young Adults (1971). Perhaps the most surprising finding of these studies, with hindsight, is that they reveal the relatively low levels of sexual behaviour of young people at that time. Schofield's work paved the way for much later specialists in the field such as Kaye Wellings. A photographic study by Damien Rudd (Birds of Panic: Sexual Behaviour of Young People) was also based on it.

It is located about south east of Leonora and north east of Kookynie in the Goldfields of Western Australia, The Laverton to Leonora railway passes through the property and had five of its stops being located within the station boundaries. Initially established by the Horan Bros. who were butchers, in about 1903, the station was running cattle along with a small flock of sheep. The Horans were the first to take up pastoral pursuits in the area, which was mostly a gold mining centre. They noted that the area was rich in mulga and saltbush year round with abundant natural grasses following rain. The property was carrying a flock of about 2,000 sheep in 1921. Sold by the Horan Bros. before 1924, the station was bought by the Foulkes-Taylor Bros., E. L. Lefroy and L. Manning, who together formed the Mt. Malcolm Pastoral Company. In 1925 the station occupied and area of and was running approximately 10,000 sheep and was fully enclosed in vermin-proof fencing. So impressed with the country, the men also bought another of adjoining country to the north that surrounded the town of Morgans which was carrying 1,400 head of cattle and was sold to them by Mr. David Dicks of the Boulder Meat supply. This property known as Mernong gave the company a fairly compact block in excess of half a million acres. One of the company directors, Chas Taylor, was managing the station in 1924. By 1928 the flock size had been increased to 12,000 sheep with Lefroy and Foulkes-Taylor introducing Peppin blood rams from the Tootra and Cranmore park studs into the flock. The sheep were in splendid condition following a good season. The station manager, Chas Foulkes-Taylor, left in 1928 to take up Yuin Station in the Murchison region. Selling 91 bales of wool at the Perth Wool sales in 1929, Glenorn wool attracted an average price of about 12 1/2 d. per pound. Following up with 222 bales in 1930 the average price was lower across the whole market and Glenorn wool attracted an average price of about 11d. per pound. A good clip was produced in 1949 when a total of 12,245 sheep including 3,084 lambs were shorn to produce 322 bales, the flock size in 1950 was only 3,572 sheep that were shorn in May to yield 89 bales of wool. In 1954 10 bales of AAA combings attracted price of 114d. per pound. Glenorn is currently owned by Minara Resources along with three other nearby properties: Nambi, Yundamindera and Minara Stations. In 2012 Glenorn and Nambi were running approximately 1,700 head of cattle. By 2016 all four stations were running a herd of cattle.

The album did not chart, though it has received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Background and release Lead singer Sky Saxon conceptualized the album's cover design depicting the four Seeds members trapped in a spider's web. A Web of Sound was produced by Saxon under the pseudonym Marcus Tybalt; Saxon also wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album (two credited under the Tybalt alias), as well as the liner notes. Side one consists of six tracks, beginning with the single \\"Mr. Farmer\\" and continuing with other garage rock-sounding songs, most of them short in duration. Side two contains only two songs, including the 14-minute closer \\"Up In Her Room\\", which features bottleneck guitar, electric fuzz-bass, electric piano, tambourine, and drums.

Reception  Pete Johnson, in a 1967 Los Angeles Times review, stated that with A Web of Sound, the Seeds had \\"been adopted by the hippies – the flower children – because of their open-ended songs which generally skirt neatly plotted thoughts and didacticism.\\" Some contemporary music critics compare album track \\"Up In Her Room\\" to The Velvet Underground song \\"Sister Ray\\", which was released a year later. In the book All Yesterdays' Parties: The Velvet Underground in Print, 1966–1971, author Clinton Heylin wrote that \\"both songs work much the same way [...] listening to them is humming in a room where another dozen people are humming also, in a constant pitch, never varying, unchanging\\". AllMusic's Joe Viglione suggested that A Web of Sound also influenced such artists as Iggy Pop and the Stooges and Alice Cooper.

The distribution of lightning, or the incidence of individual strikes, in any particular place is highly variable, but lightning does have an underlying spatial distribution. High quality lightning data has only recently become available, but the data indicates that lightning occurs on average 44 (± 5) times every second over the entire Earth, making a total of about 1.4 billion flashes per year. Ratios of lightning types The lightning flash rate averaged over the Earth for intra-cloud (IC) + cloud-to-cloud (CC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) is in the ratio: (IC+CC):CG = 3:1. The base of the negative region in a cloud is normally at roughly the elevation where freezing occurs. The closer this region is to the ground, the more likely cloud-to-ground strikes are. In the tropics, where the freeze zone is higher, the (IC+CC):CG ratio is about 9:1. In Norway, at latitude 60° N, where the freezing elevation is lower, the (IC+CC):CG ratio is about 1:1.Uman, Martin A.' \\"All About Lightning\\"; Ch. 8; p. 68, Dover Publications N.Y.; 1986; Distribution Global map of lightning frequency--strikes/km2/yr. The high lightning areas are on land located in the tropics. Areas with almost no lightning are the Arctic and Antarctic, closely followed by the oceans which have only 0.1 to 1 strikes/km2/yr. The map on the right shows that lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet. About 70% of lightning occurs on land in the Tropics, where the majority of thunderstorms occur. The North and South Poles and the areas over the oceans have the fewest lightning strikes. The place where lightning occurs most often (according to the data from 2004 to 2005) is near the small village of Kifuka in the mountains of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the elevation is around . This region received 158 lightning strikes per square kilometer (409 per sq mi) a year. Above the Catatumbo river, which feeds Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela, Catatumbo lightning flashes several times per minute and this place has the highest number of lightning strikes per square kilometer in the world. Malaysia has one of the highest rates of lightning activity in the world, after Indonesia and Colombia.https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/05/22/msia-third-highest- in-lightning-strikes/ The city of Teresina in northern Brazil has the third- highest rate of occurrences of lightning strikes in the world. The surrounding region is referred to as the Chapada do Corisco (\\"Flash Lightning Flatlands\\").. In the United States, the west coast has the fewest lightning strikes, and Florida sees more lightning than any other area; In 2018, 14 Florida counties ranked in the top 15 counties in the United States for having the highest lightning density. Florida has the largest number of recorded strikes during summer. Much of Florida is a peninsula, bordered by the ocean on three sides with a subtropical climate. The result is the nearly daily development of clouds that produce thunderstorms. For example, \\"Lightning Alley\\"—an area from Tampa to Orlando—experiences an extremely high density of lightning strikes. As of 2007, there were as many as 50 strikes per square mile (about 20 per km2) per year. In their 2018 Annual Lightning Report, Vaisala reported there were as many as 24 strikes per square mile (about 9 per km2) per year in Florida. The Empire State Building in New York City is struck by lightning on average 23 times each year, and was once struck 8 times in 24 minutes.Uman, Martin A.' \\"All About Lightning\\"; Ch. 6, p. 47, Dover Publications N.Y.; 1986; Lightning data sources World map showing frequency of lightning strikes, in flashes per square kilometer (km²) per year (equal-area projection). Lightning strikes most frequently in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Combined 1995–2003 data from the Optical Transient Detector and 1998–2003 data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor. Before technology was developed to accurately detect and record lightning flashes, climatologies were based upon the number of audible detection of thunder. The keraunic (or ceraunic) level was the average number of days per year when thunder was heard in a given area. A map of isokeraunic contours was used to give a rough estimate of relative lightning frequencies. However, variations in population, the distance sound travels due to terrain made such maps quite spurious, and human hearing made such maps imprecise. It also could not hope to differentiate between different types of lightning. Electronic lightning sensors advanced during the 20th century using radio wave disruptions. Originally the expense of such instruments caused only sporadic development. However a small set of sensors in the U.S. employed during a 1979 project by NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory grew by bits and pieces into the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), achieving nationwide coverage in 1989.

This was shortened by the Arabs to firz, and this became ferz or fers in Medieval Europe. Its name later changed to queen, but when that name started being used for the modern chess queen, its former name ferz or fers began to be used in chess problems. In Russian and Ukrainian, however, ferz (ферзь) is the current name for the chess queen. Value The ferz by itself is worth about half a knight. Three and a king can force checkmate on a bare king, if all three are not on the same color squares; two and a king can force stalemate on a bare king, but not easily. The endgame of rook versus ferz is a win for the rook. Despite being colorbound, the ferz is the strongest of the basic leapers during the opening phase of the game, even stronger than the wazir, because it has larger mobility forward. A wazir and a ferz can only force checkmate on a bare king, if the bare king is significantly close to a corner that is the same color as the ferz. Two cannot force checkmate, whether they are on the same color or not. Two wazirs cannot force checkmate. A knight and wazir can force checkmate against a bare king, but a knight and ferz can only do so if the bare king is significantly close to a corner that is the same color as the ferz. The wazir is better than the ferz in most endgames, because of the wazir's ability to restrict squares adjacent to the squares last restricted.

Special Duties Unit =Chin Hon-to= *Portrayed by Joe Ma *Episodes: 1.01—present Senior Inspector Chin Hon-to (展瀚韜; jyutping: Zin Hontou) is an SDU officer, as well as the leader and main trainer of the unit's alpha team. Known as SDU's \\"demon trainer,\\" To is tough, strict, and demanding. To's emphasis on the importance of team spirit is one of the reasons why he initially disapproves of alpha team's new member Yu Hok- lai, who is rash and overconfident. Having that his father, a police officer who was forced into early retirement because he was suspected of violating a conduct code, To is extremely cautious and rigorous when handling team missions. Despite To's austere demeanor, he can be kindhearted and friendly, and often treats his teammates to happy hour at the pub owned by his parents. To also follows his own rigorous training techniques with his subordinates, earning the respect of his team. While on a vacation with his teammate and best friend, Chong Chuk-yuen, To meets the air flight attendant Ting Wai-wai, and pursues her after falling in love at first sight. After a few months of dating, Wai-wai decides to move in with To. However, To and Wai-wai gradually grew apart due to his commitment to his work and Wai-wai's long weeks away from home. He eventually fell for Yuen's older sister and their mutual respect and similar personalities sparked a relationship, which sadly ended when Wah found herself still unable to let go of her fiancee's death, despite how much she tried. =So Man-keung= *Portrayed by Mandy Wong *Episodes: 1.01—present Probationary Inspector So Man-keung (蘇文強; jyutping: Sou Mankoeng) is a probationary inspector, currently working as an administrative support officer for SDU's alpha team.

Yu Hok-lai is the only member in the alpha team who knows of Keung's fear, and he helps her overcome it episode 11. They eventually begin a relationship following Tiger Cubs II. =Chong Cheuk-yuen= * Portrayed by Oscar Leung * Episodes: 1.01—present Acting Sergeant Chong Chuk-yuen (莊卓源; jyutping: Zong Coekjyun) is an SDU sniper of the unit's alpha team. He is the younger brother of Chong Chuk-wah, the senior inspector of OCTB's A Division. Due to Yuen's carefree and joking personality, many mistaken him to possess a careless and casual attitude towards work. However, Yuen's careful and calm judgement makes him one of the most talented sharpshooters in the unit. Yuen develops a crush on Ting Wai-wai, whom he met while on a vacation with his best friend, To. However, Wai-wai takes an interest at To, and begins to date him soon after their encounter, prompting Yuen to merely view her as a \\"sister-in-law\\". When To is unavailable to go on dates with Wai-wai, Yuen fills in his spot as Wai-wai's confidant. This causes Wai-wai to fall for him eventually, causing conflict between Yuen and To. The rift driving them apart due to this is eventually settled over time, as To stops caring for Wai-wai romantically and moves on with his life. =Yau Chun-hin= *Portrayed by Vincent Wong *Episodes: 1.01—1.13 Acting Sergeant Yau Chun-hin (邱駿軒; jyutping: Jau Zeonhin) is an SDU sniper of the unit's alpha team. He joins the team in the first episode with Yu Hok-lai, also his best friend. Lai's older brother is an accomplished law enforcer personnel, and because of this, Hin always felt like he is living under the shadow of his brother, causing him to be extremely unconfident (though this trait dissipates as time passes and Hin improves). He acts as a foil to the originally overconfident and arrogant Lai, and is often the first to bail him out of trouble or help him out. In Episode 13, the finale of Tiger Cubs, Hin shoots the motor of the boat that To Tin-yu and Yiu Mei-ling tried escaping in. This led to Yiu Mei-ling to suffer from third degree burns, and her face became scarred, prompting Yu and Mei-ling to plot revenge against Hin. They tied him to a cross and tortured him by beating him up and then burning his bare skin with hot iron, before shooting him in his legs, arms and his heart- ending his life right in front of Chin hon-to. =Yu Hok-lai= *Portrayed by Him Law *Episodes: 1.01—present Acting Sergeant Yu Hok-lai (俞學禮; jyutping: Jyu Hoklai) is an SDU officer of the unit's alpha team, specialising in assault and combat. Lai is the youngest son of Yu Sai- tong, one of the top ten wealthiest entrepreneurs of Hong Kong. Originally, Lai is portrayed with an arrogant and overbearing attitude, which puts him at odds with his superior, To, despite being the physically fittest candidate for SDU. Due to this, Lai disliked To strongly and becomes convinced that the latter is intentionally making things difficult for him, not knowing that To sees great potential in him. Lai's personality improves greatly after a case revolving around his family members is solved, causing him to deeply respect To. =Tse Kar-sing= *Portrayed by Benjamin Yuen *Episodes: 1.01—present Acting Sergeant Tse Kar-sing (謝家星; jyutping: Ze Gaasing) is an SDU officer of the unit's alpha team, and one of the team's main assaulters. =Cheung Kai- kwong= *Portrayed by William Chak *Episodes: 1.01—present Acting Sergeant Cheung Kai-kwong (張繼光; jyutping: Zoeng Gaigwong) is an SDU officer of the unit's alpha team.

She eventually starts a relationship with Chin Hon-to at the end of season one, as she prepares herself to let go of her past. However, Wah does not appear in Tiger Cubs II and was indicated to be written out of season two. Whilst in England to undergo training, she encounters the family of her deceased fiancee- Bong, and is taken to the house he had prepared as their marital home- done in detail to her exact liking so that she and Bong could move in even though the latter has died.

His professional accomplishments were to decipher neumes (khaz) of Armenian church music, analyze the musical theory of old Armenia and research the life and works of Armenian composers from medieval times to modern era. Tahmizian's discoveries in the area of the medieval Armenian notational system open a door to understanding and interpreting the liturgical chants (Шаракан) of the period. His book Modern Neumology (2003) summarizes his forty years of research in the field. Several dozen neumatic symbols have now been revealed, defined, categorized and interpreted as a result of his work. A page from medieval Armenian manuscript illustrating neumatic notation. His research into the musical heritage of Armenia revealed and explained the most crucial periods in the history of Armenian music and its notorious representatives. He brought to life the musical contributions of Mesrop Mashtots (5th century), Sahak Partev (Isaac of Armenia, 4th/5th century), Movses Khorenatsi (5th century), Gregory of Narek (Grigor Narekatsi, 10th century), Nerses Shnorhali (12th century), Sayat-Nova (18th century), Makar Yekmalian (19th century), Dikran Tchouhadjian (19th century), Komitas (early 20th century) and others. His work placed an overall historical perspective of the musical development in Armenia from 5th to 20th Centuries. He categorized the period from ancient times to the 12th century as an ascending era, and the timeframe from 13th to 18th centuries as a period of creative decline. He also conducted extensive research into the theory of Armenian music from the pagan era to the church music of the 8th Century A.D. In his defining book entitled 'Theory of Music in Ancient Armenia' (published in Armenia, 1977, in Russian) he interpreted and classified the modal system used during this period. He also analyzed the metric and rhythmic constructs and their formational significance. He explained the uniqueness of the Armenian oktoechos and shed light upon the conceptual and aesthetical issues of the medieval music of Armenia. Moreover, he brought into focus the specific characteristics of the Armenian modes as compared and contrasted with Persian, Arabic, Turkish, as well as Greek, Russian and Caucasian modal systems. Throughout his career, Tahmizian published over a dozen books and around two hundred articles and essays in Armenian, Russian, English, French and Polish. He has also delivered over 60 academic lectures in universities and conservatories throughout the former Soviet Union, as well as London (1978), Rome (1981), Tokyo (1985), Paris (1989), San Francisco (1990) and New York City (1993). He contributed to the Russian Music Encyclopedia (published from 1973 to 1982 in Moscow, six volumes, in Russian), and Armenian Encyclopedia (published from 1974 to 1987 in Yerevan, thirteen volumes, in Armenian).  Brief biography  Born in Athens, Greece on May 9, 1926. Received elementary education at the local Armenian school, followed by high school at the Melkonian Educational Institute in Cyprus on a merit based scholarship. After graduation in 1945, being recognized as a promising young musical scholar, he received a fully funded fellowship for a seven-year academic course at the Music Conservatory of Brussels, Belgium. The \\"Repatriation Movement\\", however, initiated by the government of post-war Armenia, changed his plans. Along with over hundred thousand Armenians (scattered around the globe as a direct result of the 1915 Genocide) he moved to Soviet Armenia in 1946. In September of that year, he was admitted and started his education at the Romanos Melikian Musical College of Yerevan - graduating in 1950. From 1950 to 1956 he attended the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory, Musicology Department. He completed his graduate studies with a thesis on 13th century Armenian monk Hovhannes Yerznkatzi's views on music theory. From 1947 to 1956 Tahmizian worked at the Yerevan Opera House occupying the chair of third French Horn in the orchestra. From 1956 to 1960 he completed his post-graduate studies at St. Petersburg State Conservatory under the mentorship of renowned music scholar Christopher Kushnarev. It was here that he met his lifetime soul mate Svetalan Nikitina (later Svetlana Tahmizian) - a talented musician studying with the famous pianist and organist Professor Braudo (Браудо, Исайя Александрович). From 1960 to 1990 he was a senior researcher at Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts (Matenadaran) in Yerevan, Armenia. During the same period he actively collaborated with the Composers' Union of Armenia, Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory and the Armenian National Academy of Sciences. Tahmizian upheld his dissertation for doctoral candidacy in 1962 on the history of Armenian music from 5th to 8th centuries A.D. In 1980 he obtained an honorary doctorate degree presenting the publication of his monumental work \\"Theory of Music in Ancient Armenia.\\" In 1984 he was awarded an honorary title for his accomplishments in musical arts by the government of Armenia. In 1987 he was granted professorship of musical sciences by the music history department of the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory. From 1990 to 2011 he resided in Pasadena, California. He was honored to become a US citizen in 1995. During this time he continued his research and involvement in Armenian music history. He published five books and a dozen articles. He also lectured in various US cities.

By Friederike Sophie Seyler.\\" Oberon, or The Elf King (), or simply Oberon, originally known as Huon and Amanda (), is a romantic Singspiel in five acts by Friederike Sophie Seyler, based on the poem Oberon by Christoph Martin Wieland, which itself was based on the epic romance Huon of Bordeaux, a French medieval tale. It has been named for two of its central characters, the knight Huon and the fairy king Oberon, respectively. The opera was published in \\"Flensburg, Schleswig and Leipzig\\" in 1789, the year Seyler died. Seyler was married to the prominent theatre director Abel Seyler, the founder of the Seyler Theatre Company and a noted promoter of both German opera and William Shakespeare. The opera was dedicated to their common long-time friend and collaborator, the actor Friedrich Ludwig Schröder. Seyler's opera and a plagiarized version by Karl Ludwig Giesecke both enjoyed popularity from the late 18th century. The opera also had a central role in the development of Emanuel Schikaneder's theatre and its focus on fairy tale operas which culminated in The Magic Flute, and was one of the influences that the latter's libretto built upon. The Giesecke version and its influence on The Magic Flute Seyler's libretto formed the basis of Karl Ludwig Giesecke's libretto for the opera Oberon, written for Emanuel Schikaneder's troupe and set to music by Paul Wranitzky. As Giesecke did not credit her, he later came under much criticism for plagiarism, although it soon became evident that his work was based on Seyler's libretto. The opera The Magic Flute, with a libretto by Schikaneder, was to a significant degree based on Giesecke's version of Oberon and thus ultimately on Seyler.David J. Buch, Magic Flutes and Enchanted Forests: The Supernatural in Eighteenth-Century Musical Theater, University of Chicago Press, 2008 According to Peter Branscombe, \\"it has long been recognized that Giesecke, the named author of Wranitzky's libretto, deserves little credit for what is largely a plagiarism,\\" concluding that \\"Giesecke's \\"Oberon, König der Elfen is hardly more than a mild revision of Seyler's book.\\" After the theatrical success of Giesecke's plagiarized version (and also after Seyler's death), Seyler's original was renamed Oberon and performed under this title.Peter Branscombe, W. A. Mozart: Die Zauberflöte, Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 28 Giesecke's version of Seyler's Oberon was the first opera performed by Schikaneder's troupe at their new theater, and established a tradition within the company of fairy tale operas that was to culminate in The Magic Flute two years later.

Burton Burton v. United States is the name of two appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States by Senator Joseph R. Burton (R-KS) following his conviction for compensated representation of a party in a proceeding in which the United States was interested: Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283 (1905)Burton v. United States (Burton I), 196 U.S. 283 (1905). and Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344 (1906).Burton v. United States (Burton II), 202 U.S. 344 (1906). Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to Rialto Grain and Securities Company in the United States Postmaster General's investigation of Rialto for mail fraud. On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court reversed his convictions because venue and vicinage could not be proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the check to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, on the ground that the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis. Burton was the first defendant convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became the first member of the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime.United States Senate Historical Office, Expulsion and Censure. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute for his role in the Oregon land fraud scandal.Jerry A. O'Callaghan, Senator Mitchell and the Oregon Land Frauds, 1905, 21 255 (1952). Background Rialto was named for the historic financial center in Venice. =Rialto Co.'s matter= In 1872, Congress created the crime of mail fraud.Jed S. Rakoff, The Federal Mail Fraud Statute (Part I), 18 771 (1980). Rev. Stat. § 3929 authorized the United States Postmaster General, \\"upon evidence satisfactory to him\\" that mail fraud was being committed, to instruct the post master at the fraudster's local post office to return registered mail addressed to the fraudster to the sender with the word \\"Fraudulent\\" written or stamped on the envelope.Rev. Stat. § 3929. In 1895, this authority was extended to all mail.Act of Mar. 2, 1895, ch. 191, 26 Stat. 465; 28 Stat. 963, 964. Further, Rev. Stat. § 4041 authorized the Postmaster to also bar suspected fraudsters from cashing postal money orders.26 Stat. 465, 466 (codified at Rev. Stat. § 4041). The Rialto Grain and Securities Company, whose principal place of business was in St. Louis, Missouri, was under investigation by the Postmaster for mail fraud.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 360-363. The Postmaster had received two complaints and forwarded them for investigation on November 7, 1902. State courts were also investigating complaints from investors against Rialto. Hugh C. Dennis, the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) none had been convicted. As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted in federal court and four indictments were pending against him in state courts. For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial attachment by its creditors. =Burton's representation= Burton deposited his checks at Riggs National Bank. That same month--while the two were in Illinois, en route from St. Louis to Chicago--former state judge Thomas B. Harlan, the general counsel of Rialto, arranged to hire Senator Joseph R. Burton (R-KS), a lawyer, to appear before the Postmaster as counsel for Rialto in connection with these investigations for a monthly salary of $500.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 361-64, 382. When the general counsel returned to St. Louis on November 18, he communicated Burton's offer to Rialto and Rialto accepted.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 361-64, 382-83. Rialto notified Burton of its acceptance by telegram to him in Washington that same day.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 283. Burton informed Rialto by mail that he had learned of the two complaints from the Postmaster, arranged for himself to be notified of any future complaints, and arranged to represent Rialto in a hearing before the Postmaster before any sanctions would issue. Burton continued to represent Rialto before the Postmaster, and draw his monthly salary, for five months.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 283-84. Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 363-64. Rialto paid Burton by monthly checks for the first four months. Burton received the first check on November 22.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 285. Burton indorsed and deposited the checks at Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C., which in turn sent the checks to Rialto's bank, the Commonwealth Trust Company in St. Louis, Missouri, for payment.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 296. The last $500 was paid in cash to Burton in person, at Rialto's office in St. Louis, on March 26, 1903, after which Burton's representation of Rialto terminated.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 283-84; Burton II, 202 U.S. at 364-65. =Indictment= A federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri was already investigating the Brooks Brokerage Company, with which Dennis, the President of Rialto, was associated. Witnesses against Burton at the grand jury included Chief Post Office Inspector William E. Cochran, Dennis, and W.B. Mehaney, the Vice President of Rialto. About two weeks before Burton's indictment, the grand jury came into possession of the checks from Rialto to Burton. Burton was indicted on January 24, 1904, in the Eastern District of Missouri, on nine counts of violating Rev. Stat. § 1782.Senator Burton Indicted, , Jan. 24, 1904. Section 1782 (enacted 1864) provided, in relevant part: > No Senator . . . after his election and during his continuance in office . . > . shall receive or agree to receive any compensation whatever, directly or > indirectly, for any services rendered, or to be rendered, to any person, > either by himself or another, in relation to any proceeding . . . > controversy . . . or other matter or thing in which the United States is a > party, or directly or indirectly interested, before any Department . . . > whatever. Every person offending against this section shall be deemed guilty > of a misdemeanor, and shall be imprisoned not more than two years, and fined > not more than ten thousand dollars, and shall, moreover, by conviction > therefor, be rendered forever thereafter incapable of holding any office of > honor, trust, or profit under the Government of the United States.13 Stat. > 123, ch. 119 (codified at Rev. Stat. § 1782). The current version of this > statute is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 203. The first and second counts of the indictment pertained to the receipt of the final cash payment from Rialto with reference to two separate interests of the United States.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 378. The third count pertained to receipt of the final cash payment from Mahaney. The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth counts of the indictment pertained to the receipt of the four check for the first four months. Burton arguably could not have been arrested at the time of his indictment because Congress was in session. Article One provides that Senators and Representatives \\"shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same.\\" art. I, § 6, cl. 1. But, Burton voluntarily surrendered. On January 24, Burton and his wife departed for St. Louis.Burton to Face Charges, , Jan. 24, 1904. =Trial and conviction= Assistant U.S. Attorney Horace Dyer prosecuted Burton at both trials. Judge Elmer Bragg Adams, sitting as the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, presided over Burton's trial. Former state judge Chester H. Krum appeared as Burton's attorney. Assistant U.S. Attorney Horace Dyer acted as prosecutor. In his opening statement, Krum argued that Burton had only agreed to act as general counsel and to allow his name to be placed in Rialto's literature, and that the agreement explicitly provided that Burton would never represent Rialto before any federal agency.Senator Burton on Trial, , Mar. 23, 1904. On March 23, the prosecution began its case in chief. Post Office Department employees identified the letters of complaint received against Rialto.Burton Wrote for Pay, , Mar. 23, 1904. Ernest H. Kastor, of a St. Louis advertising firm, testified that he introduced Burton to Dennis and Harlan in November 1902. Witnesses said that the agreement was as Krum described and that the pay was agreed as $2,500 in $500 installments. Dyer read into evidence the letter from Burton to Rialto. The prosecution's case continued on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton had attempted to discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public.Burton Needed $70,000, , Mar. 24, 1904. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton had told him that he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested. The defense case commenced on March 25.Senator Burton Wanted to Build Up Practice, , Mar. 25, 1904. The third count of the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, and that he had only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise. After the jury returned deadlocked 11-1, Judge Adams delivered an Allen charge. Soon afterwards, the jury returned a verdict that failed to address the third count in the indictment, so the Judge Allen ordered the jury to return to deliberations without reading the verdict. On March 28, 1904, after forty-one total hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Burton on five counts--counts one, two, six, eight, and nine--but acquitted on count three.Burton Is Guilty; Will Fight Verdict, , Mar. 28, 1904. Burton's convictions would have authorized a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a $50,000 fine. Burton asked that the jury be polled, and each stated that the verdict was his own. Burton moved for a new trial. Judge Adams indicated that he would accept a supersedeas bond of $5,000, and Burton was not sentenced. Burton became the first defendant ever convicted under § 1782, more than 40 years after its enactment. Burton had a right to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, but instead opted for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. On July 2, Judge Adams certified Burton's direct appeal on the grounds that Burton was convicted of an \\"infamous offense.\\"Gives J.R. Burton an Appeal, , July 2, 1904. Burton posted a $10,000 bond. On July 11, Justice Brewer allowed the direct appeal.Senator Burton's Appeal Granted by Brewer, , July 12, 1904. Burton I (1905) Before the Supreme Court, on November 30 and December 1, 1904, Burton was represented by (former judge) John Forrest Dillon and (future Solicitor General) Frederick William Lehmann at oral argument, with Harry Hubbard and W.H. Rossington also on the brief.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 287. Solicitor General Henry M. Hoyt represented the United States. On January 16, 1905, the Court overturned Burton's convictions. =Sufficiency of the indictment and the evidence= Without any discussion of the merits, 5-4, the Court held that the indictment stated offenses under § 1782 and that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have convicted Burton.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 295-96. Justices Harlan, Brown, McKenna, Holmes, and Day were in the majority; Chief Justice Fuller, and Justices Peckham, Brewer, and White, were in dissent. =Venue and vicinage= Article III provides that: \\"The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.\\" art. III, § 2, cl. 2. The Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides that: \\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . .\\" amend. VI. Burton argued that both constitutional provisions were violated because the crime had not occurred in the Eastern District of Missouri. Justice Peckham, writing for the entire Court except for Justice Harlan in dissent, reversed Burton's convictions on these grounds.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 296-304. The Court held that Burton's negotiation of the check in Washington, D.C. did not constitute conduct by Burton in St. Louis (the site of the drawee bank). In other words, whatever the Washington, D.C. bank did with the check afterwards, it did for itself, not as Burton's agent. \\"From the time of the delivery of the check by the defendant to the bank it became the owner of the check; it could have torn it up or thrown it in the fire or made any other use or disposition of it which it chose, and no right of defendant would have been infringed.\\"Burton I, 196 U.S. at 297. Thus, the Court held that it was error for the trial judge to have submitted the question of the \\"understanding . . . between the defendant and the bank\\" to the jury.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 300. In support of this argument, the Court cited several of its own precedents concerning negotiable instrument law, as well as cases from the House of Lords and the courts of New York and Massachusetts.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 301-04. In a single paragraph, the Court rejected the application of the continuing offense doctrine, which had been codified in Rev. Stat. § 731.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 304. \\"This is not a case of the commencement of a crime in one district and its completion in another, so that under the statute the court in either district has jurisdiction. There was no beginning of the offense in Missouri. The payment of the money was in Washington, and there was no commencement of that offense when the officer of the Rialto Company sent the checks from St. Louis to defendant. The latter did not thereby begin an offense in Missouri.\\"Burton I, 196 U.S. at 304 (citations omitted). Justice Harlan dissented on this ground.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 308-10 (Harlan, J., dissenting). \\"As between the accused and his client,\\" Harlan argued, \\"he was not, in any true sense, compensated for the services alleged to have been rendered in violation of the statute, until by payment of the checks by the St. Louis bank he was relieved of all liability to the Riggs National Bank arising from his indorsing the checks to it.\\"Burton I, 196 U.S. at 309-10. Harlan concluded that the majority had \\"sacrificed substance to mere form,\\" illustrating the Latin maxim \\"Qui haeret in litera haeret in cortice.\\"Burton I, 196 U.S. at 310 (Harlan, J., dissenting). =Refused jury instructions= By the same 8-1 majority, the Court found a separate and independent ground for the reversal of Burton's convictions.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 304-08. Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: \\"[These instructions were] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while I think they have, in the main, been covered by the charge, yet I will give them to you. . . . These are abstract propositions of law, which I give in connection with the charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it. I am willing to give them, inasmuch as they are asked, and they contain general propositions of law.\\" After the jury returned deadlocked 11-1, the trial judge delivered an Allen charge.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 305. At this point, the judge refused Burton's request to instruct the jury that the earlier requested instructions stood on the same footing as the other instructions.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 305-06. The Court held that this was reversible error.Burton I, 196 U.S. at 306-07. Harlan also dissented from this ground for reversal, arguing that Burton was not substantially prejudiced. Further, the Court disapproved of the judge's having asked the jury for the proportions of their deadlock (even though he did not ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal). In Brasfield v. United States (1926), citing Burton, the Court held that such was reversible error, regardless of whether the defendant objected in the trial court.Brasfield v. United States, 272 U.S. 448 (1926). Retrial Judge (and future Supreme Court Justice) Van Devanter presided over Burton's second trial. Burton was reindicted, still in the circuit court Eastern District of Missouri, on April 13, 1905,Senator Burton Reindicted, , Apr. 13, 1905. and arraigned on June 4 before Judge John Henry Rogers, of the Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation.Burton Again Arraigned, , June 4, 1905. The new indictment had eight counts.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 360.Senator Burton Convicted, , Nov. 30, 1905. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts charged that Burton had agreed to receive compensation from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto. The counts different only in the interest of the United States which was alleged to have been involved in the matter. Counts four and five were dismissed before trial.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 361. Unlike the first indictment, the second alleged that Burton had received $500 in person in St. Louis. The first indictment alleged only compensated representation, the second indictment also alleged an agreement to do so.New Trial for Senator, , Sept. 12, 1905. While the indictment was pending, Burton was robbed in Chicago and his wallet was recovered in a mail box by postal employees.Robbed Senator Burton, , May 13, 1905. Before Burton's second trial, the Department of Justice learned that Burton had also collected $14,000 for representing the Chickasaw before the Interior Department: $5,000 of which was paid directly to him, and $9,000 of which was paid to his brother Z.R. Burton.New Case Against Burton, , Aug. 23, 1905. The trial date was originally set for October 3, and subpoenas to witnesses--many of whom resided in Washington, D.C.--issued on September 12. Judge Willis Van Devanter (a future Supreme Court justice), of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit presided over Burton's second trial.Burton Must Go to Jail Supreme Court Decides, , May 21, 1906. On November 20, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dyer gave the opening statement for the prosecution and Lehmann for the defense.Senator Burton on trial, , Nov. 20, 1905. As in the first trial, Lehmann argued that Burton's intent was to represent Dennis (now deceased) in a criminal case. On November 21, the prosecution introduced the letters, telegrams, and checks into evidence.Burton Got $500 a Month, , Nov. 21, 1905. On November 22, Harland testified that Burton had stated: \\"I am not going to do anything inconsistent with my duty as a Senator.\\"Destroyed Burton Letters, , Nov. 22, 1905. Mahaney testified to the in-person payment and the destruction of the letters at Burton's request on March 22, 1902. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton represented Rialto before him. On November 26, 1905, after two hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Burton on the six remaining counts: counts one, two, three, six, seven, and eight.Senator Burton Convicted, , Nov. 27, 1905. Burton was sentenced on the sixth and seventh counts only (because some of the counts involved the same transactions). Burton was sentenced to six months imprisonment in a county jail and a $2,000 fine on the sixth count and six months imprisonment and a $500 fine on the seventh count. In addition, he was \\"rendered forever hereafter incapable of holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the Government of the United States.\\" Burton II (1906) Dillon, the leader of Burton's appellate team The second time before the Court, on April 3-4, 1906, Burton was again represented by Dillon and Lehmann, plus Bailey P. Waggener, again with Hubbard and Rossington on the brief, plus W. Knox Haynes and W.P. Hackney.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 345. All together, Burton was represented by a team of ten lawyers, led by Dillon.Senator's Above Courts, Burton's Brief Says, , Mar. 30, 1906. Waggener delivered the argument in chief, assisted by Lehmann. Assistant Attorney General (and future judge) Charles Henry Robb represented the United States. On May 21, 1906, the Supreme Court upheld Burton's convictions. That same day, another of Burton's lawyers, former Senator John Mellen Thurston, filed a petition for rehearing, which operated as a 60-day continuance, and in effect stayed the matter much longer because the Court was set to adjourn until October. =Separation of powers= Article One provides: \\"Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . . . . Each House may . . . punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.\\" art. I, § 5, cls. 1-2. Burton argued that § 1782 was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers because the Senate's power to punish its members was exclusive. Burton's brief compared the ban on legislators practicing before executive agencies to a ban on the President lobbying legislators for legislation. The New York Times called this \\"one of the most interesting efforts to get a new meaning out of the Constitution that has appeared for some time.\\" A later article noted that, \\"[t]he decision is especially interesting because of the large array of legal talent in the case and the ingenious argument made by Bailey Wagner [sic] of Topeka that the Senate is the judge of the qualifications of its own members . . . .\\" The Court unanimously rejected this argument.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 365-70. The Court cited earlier laws prohibiting members of Congress from practicing before the United States Court of Claims and from entering into contracts with the United States.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 365-66 (citing Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 92, 12 Stat. 765 (codified at Rev. Stat. § 1058) and Rev. Stat. § 3739). Further, the Court noted that \\"[t]he proper discharge of those duties does not require a Senator to appear before an executive Department in order to enforce his particular views, or the views of others, in respect of matters committed to that Department for determination.\\"Burton II, 202 U.S. at 367. Burton also argued that the provision rendering those convicted under § 1782 \\"incapable of holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the Government of the United States\\" unconstitutionally infringed on the Qualifications Clause. The Court dodged this question by holding that the provision would not bar a convicted defendant from serving in the Senate because Senators (at the time) were elected by the state legislatures.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 369-70. =Interests of the United States= Burton next argued that the indictment was insufficient because the Postmaster's decision to return mail addressed to suspected fraudsters back to senders and to bar suspected fraudsters from cashing money orders was not a \\"proceeding . . . controversy. . . or other matter or thing in which the United States is . . . directly or indirectly interested.\\" The Court rejected this argument, 6-3.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 370-73. Although the Court admitted that the United States had no pecuniary interest in the proceeding, it argued: > The United States was the real party in interest on one side, while the > Rialto Company was the real party in interest on the other side. If the > Postmaster General did not represent the United States, whom did he > represent? . . . [I]t is, we think, a mistake to say that the United States > was not interested, directly or indirectly, in protecting its property, that > is, its mails and postal facilities, against improper and illegal use . . . > .\\"Burton II, 202 U.S. at 370-71 (citations omitted). Justice Brewer, joined by Justices White and Peckham dissented on this point. They argued that the statute applied only to the pecuniary interests of the United States.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 390-400 (Brewer, J., dissenting). These justices were among the four (in addition to Chief Justice Fuller) who would have held the indictment insufficient in Burton I, presumably for this reason.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 390 (Brewer J., dissenting). The dissenters argued that the majority's interpretation would find the United States interested in any administrative proceeding, thus rendering the statutory words \\"before any Department, court martial, bureau, officer, or any civil, military, or naval commission whatever\\" to be mere surplussage.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 396-97 (Brewer, J., dissenting). Further, the dissent cited the Reconstruction Era legislative history pointing towards a narrower interpretation.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 398-99 (Brewer, J., dissenting). =Sufficiency of the evidence= Burton next argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Reviewing the evidence, the Court rejected this argument.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 373-77. =Separate offenses of agreeing and receiving= Section 1782 provided that \\"No Senator . . . shall receive or agree to receive any compensation . . . .\\" Burton argued that he could not simultaneously be charged with separate offenses for agreeing to receive compensation and actually receiving compensation for the same transaction. The Court rejected this argument.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 377-78. The Court stated that Burton's interpretation \\"does violence to [the statute's] words,\\" emphasizing the word \\"or.\\" Justice McKenna disagreed with this holding. Thus, he concurred only in the affirmance of the charges alleging receipt, not the charges alleging agreement.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 389-90 (McKenna, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). =Double jeopardy= Burton next argued that his prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal on the third count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 379-80. The Court rejected this argument.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 378-81. The Court held that the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 379. =Venue and vicinage= Finally, Burton argued that the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an argument that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 381-89. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 381-83. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 384-86. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III does not require the physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.Burton II, 202 U.S. at 386-89. Aftermath Burton remained a Senator while each of his appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate. However, Burton did appear in the Senate after his conviction. On April 6, 1904, Burton appeared to push for appropriations for the acquisition of land in the Adirondacks and Catskills.Adirondacks for the Rich, , Apr. 6, 1904. On January 22, 1906, Burton appeared in the Senate chamber again, for 30 seconds, in order to be eligible for $1,000 in travel reimbursements from the federal government.Burton's Step Costs $1,000, , Jan. 22, 1906. Burton's term was due to expire on March 4, 1907. After his conviction was finally affirmed, a resolution to expel Burton from the Senate was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections on May 22, 1906. Burton resigned from office on June 4, 1906, before the Senate could act.United States Senate Historical Office, The Expulsion Case of Joseph R. Burton of Kansas (1906). Burton served five months of his six-month sentence in the Iron County Jail in Ironton, Missouri. In March 1907, he returned to Abilene. Role of President Roosevelt Circuit Attorney Folk visited the White House prior to Burton's indictment. Contemporary rumor held that Burton's indictment had been ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt. Although Joseph W. Folk, the Circuit Attorney for the City of St. Louis (and future Governor of Missouri), had recently visited with the President and Attorney General, the New York Times reported that \\"there was not a word in either of those interviews about the Burton case.\\" Burton himself alleged that Roosevelt had orchestrated his prosecution on March 23, 1907 speech in Abilene, Kansas after his release from prison.Rossevelt Plotted to Ruin Me-- Burton, , Mar. 23, 1907. Burton pointed out that his was the first prosecution under § 1782 and that numerous other public officials before him had potentially violated it, under the interpretation that prevailed in the Supreme Court. Burton and Roosevelt had a complicated history. Burton, as a leader at the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester I. Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS).Extraordinary Charge Against a Senator, , July 12, 1903. When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt. Earlier that year, while accompanying Roosevelt on a visit to Kansas, Burton told Roosevelt about his project to create a reproduction of Jerusalem at the time of Christ's birth for the St. Louis World's Fair. Roosevelt gave Burton a letter praising the exhibit, which Burton in turn published by facsimile in a magazine advertisement for the sale of stock in the exhibit. The White House received a letter from the magazine inquiring into the authenticity of the letter on the same day that Mulvane returned for a second meeting to press Smith's appointment. Roosevelt was enraged, demanded the return of the letter, and declared that \\"from now on Burton would be considered politically a Democratic Senator, as far as patronage is concerned.\\" \\"The President's indignation knew no bounds. He had never been so grossly and humiliatingly deceived during his incumbency in office.\\" Burton was also in a \\"long standing feud\\" with Fourth Assistant Postmaster (and future Senator) Joseph L. Bristow, whom Burton had lobbied Roosevelt (and his predecessor, William McKinley) to replace. Roosevelt refused to remove Bristow except for cause, and in any case refused to appoint one of Burton's friends to replace him. Another issue with which Burton clashed with Roosevelt was reciprocity with Cuba. Burton cited this issue in his Abilene speech. In order to force concessions from Roosevelt, Burton had joined with Senators from beet sugar states. Although Burton publicly spoke against a treaty with Cuba, he repeatedly privately informed Roosevelt that he would support the ratification of the treaty. According to the New York Times, \\"[t]he history of Burton's manoeuvres at this time will never be fully told.\\" Notes Further reading * 37-39 (2d ed. 2003). . *Peter W.

It was not originally conceived as a unified and systematical book, but rather as series of essays on the theater, which Lessing wrote as commentary on the plays of the short-lived Hamburg National Theater. This collection of 101 short essays represents one of the first sustained critical engagements with the potential of theater as a vehicle for the advancement of humanistic discourse. In many ways, the Hamburg Dramaturgy defined the new field of dramaturgy, and also introduced the term. During the time Lessing wrote the Hamburg Dramaturgy, there was a new movement of German theatre, based on self-reflection. Actors were beginning to perform the inner and outer lives of their characters at the same time. One of Lessing's most famous and renowned quotes from the compilation considers the responsibilities of the actor and the playwright: “The great discernment of the drama critic lies in his ability to distinguish, whenever he feels pleasure or displeasure, to what extent that feeling should be credited to the writer or to the actor” The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic to reflect on the Hamburg National Theater's efforts was conceived by the theatre's founder Johann Friedrich Löwen, and Abel Seyler, \\"the power behind the throne,\\" who at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success.George Freedley, John A. Reeves, A history of the theatre, Crown Publishers, 1968, p. 243 Because the plays of the new German Bourgeoisie theatre became more detailed and complicated, the audience often felt confused or left out; Lessing’s development of the Hamburg Dramaturgy was in part a reaction to this. Topics covered by Lessing in the series of essays include Aristotle's theory of tragedy, acting theory, the role of theater in society, the means by which theater achieves its emotional effects, criticism of the actor and the play, issues of translation, and a nascent theory of the psychology of emotions. Lessing's writings were influential for many German theater artists who came after, notably Bertolt Brecht.  Analysis of actors  The analysis of the actor, according to Lessing, is grey area for a dramaturge. It is important to know that with an actor's performance, the circumstances are a large factor to the performance, whereas, for example, the text itself is easier to judge because it simply involves literary analysis. When analyzing an actor's performance, current events, environment, and mentality of the actor must all be taken into account. When Lessing published his essays, numerous actors from Hamburg plays were upset with Lessing's carelessness and disregard of their talents in his essay.Bernd Stegemann, “On German dramaturgy.” In The Routledge Companion to Dramturgy, ed. Magda Romanska (New York: Routledge, 2015), 45.  Translations  In 1890, Helen Zimmern published an English translation of the text, which was re-published by Dover in 1962. Zimmern's translation omits nearly 30% of the original text. Translators Wendy Arons and Sara Figal, with editor Natalya Baldyga, are producing a new, complete, and fully annotated translation of the text; the essays are being published online at MediaCommons Press and will be published in print form by Routledge. Lessing's collection of essays are still being used as references today for the topic of dramaturgy, especially as a reference for art of theatre as an outlet for self-reflection, and how circumstances of the era during which a play was written affects how the audience perceives the work.

The languages of Buyeo, Goguryeo, Dongye and Okjeo were said to be similar to one another but different from the language of the Yilou to the north (believed on non-linguistic grounds to be Tungusic). Other sources suggest that the ruling class of Baekje may have spoken a Puyŏ language. The Puyŏ languages are very poorly attested, and their affiliation is unclear. However, most researchers in Korea assume that Puyŏ is a branch of the Koreanic language family. Some western researchers propose that the Goguryeo language was the ancestor of Korean, and subsequently spread to the south of the peninsula.  Puyŏ and Han languages  Chinese histories provide the only contemporaneous descriptions of peoples of the Korean peninsula and eastern Manchuria in the early centuries of the common era. They contain impressionistic remarks about the languages of the area based on second-hand reports, and sometimes contradict one another. Chapter 30 \\"Description of the Eastern Barbarians\\" of the Records of the Three Kingdoms records a survey carried out by the Chinese state of Wei after their defeat of Goguryeo in 244. The report states that the languages of Buyeo, Goguryeo and Ye were similar, and that the language of Okjeo was only slightly different from them. The same text records that the language of the Yilou to the north differed from that of Buyeo and Goguryeo. Chapter 94 of the History of the Northern Dynasties (compiled in 659) states that the language of the Mohe in the same area was different from that of Goguryeo. These languages are completely unattested, but are believed, on the basis of their location and the description of the people, to have been Tungusic. The \\"Description of the Eastern Barbarians\\" also describes the Samhan ('three Han') in the southern part of the Korean peninsula as culturally significantly different from the northern peoples. Based on this text, Lee Ki-Moon divided the languages spoken on the Korean peninsula at that time into Puyŏ and Han groups. Lee originally proposed that these were two branches of a Koreanic language family, a view that was widely adopted by scholars in Korea. He later argued that the Puyŏ languages were intermediate between Korean and Japanese. The Book of Liang (635) states that the language of Baekje was the same as that of Goguryeo. According to Korean traditional history, the kingdom of Baekje was founded by immigrants from Goguryeo who took over the Mahan confederacy. Based on a passage in the Book of Zhou (636) and some Baekje words cited in the Japanese history Nihon Shoki (720), Kōno Rokurō argued that the kingdom of Baekje was bilingual, with the gentry speaking a Puyŏ language and the common people a Han language. Christopher Beckwith claimed that the Puyŏ languages (which he called Koguryoic) were most closely related to Japanese. Beckwith's work has been criticized on both linguistic and historical grounds, though the former presence of Japonic languages on the Korean peninsula is widely accepted. Some authors believe that the Puyŏ languages belong to the Tungusic family. Others believe that there is insufficient evidence to support a classification. Alexander Vovin and James Marshall Unger argue that Goguryeo brought an early form of the Korean language to the peninsula from Manchuria, replacing the Japonic languages which they believe were spoken in the Samhan.  Linguistic data  There is no evidence of the languages of Buyeo, Okjeo or Ye, but Goguryeo became a powerful kingdom, conquering much of central Korea before it was destroyed by the armies of Silla and the Chinese Tang dynasty in the late 7th century. The Korean history Samguk sagi contains glosses of placenames from Goguryeo, but these are difficult to interpret, and many scholars also doubt that they reflect the language of Goguryeo. Other evidence of the Goguryeo language is extremely meagre. Chapter 37 of the Samguk sagi (compiled in 1145) contains a list of pronunciations and meanings of placenames in the former kingdom of Goguryeo. Both are recorded in Chinese characters, making their pronunciations difficult to interpret, but different names appear to resemble Tungusic, Korean and Japonic words. Other authors point out that most of the place names come from central Korea, an area captured by Goguryeo from Baekje and other states in the 5th century, and none from the historical homeland of Goguryeo north of the Taedong River. These authors suggest that the place names reflect the languages of those states rather than that of Goguryeo. This would explain why they seem to reflect multiple language groups. It is generally agreed that these glosses demonstrate that Japonic languages were once spoken in part of the Korean peninsula, but there is no consensus on the identity of the speakers. A small number of inscriptions have been found in Goguryeo, the earliest being the Gwanggaeto Stele (erected in Ji'an in 414). All are written in Chinese, but feature some irregularities that reflect the native language of their authors. These include occasional use of object–verb order (as found in Korean) instead of the usual Chinese verb–object order, and particles 之 and 伊, for which some authors have proposed Korean interpretations. Chinese texts such as the Book of Wei (6th century) contain a few Goguryeo words, which appear to have Korean etymologies. The Jurchen and Manchu languages contain loanwords that appear to be Korean; Alexander Vovin proposes Goguryeo as the likely source.

Plot Sister Letizia, after having worked in African missions, is sent to close a convent on an island in the Gulf of Naples and, as soon as she arrives at her destination, she successfully undertakes to obtain good offers for the sale of the land of the convent. Here he meets a boy named Salvatore whom he grows fond of. With great skill then, Sister Letizia goes beyond the task entrusted to her and undertakes to avoid the closure of the convent, and to reopen the kindergarten that the nuns once held; thus the sale is upset. During his stay he becomes more and more fond of little Salvatore, fatherless, whose mother plans to get married for a second time. Her boyfriend, however, has no intention of taking Salvatore into the future family and the woman, cornered, eventually chooses to follow her boyfriend to Naples and leave Salvatore in the convent, entrusting him to Sister Letizia. From this moment on, Sister Letizia begins to feel less and less a nun and more and more a woman and a mother, eager to protect the little one she becomes attached to, to the point of neglecting her duties. Sister Letizia's attachment to the child was noticed by the nuns, who respectfully point out to her how her preference is now evident to all the other children in the kindergarten. Called back to Rome, Sister Letizia decides to take Salvatore with her to the disapproval of her sisters. The night before leaving, however, the child clearly demonstrates to Sister Letizia that she could not replace her mother in her heart as, up until that moment, she had deluded herself that she could. The next day Sister Letizia decides to put the good of the child before her own: so she goes to Naples instead of Rome, bringing the baby back to the mother and intervening energetically in front of the boyfriend, so that he accepts Salvatore in the new family.

The treaty was driven by Louis XIV, who was preparing to seize the Spanish Netherlands. The Portuguese Restoration War, which had begun in 1640, was coming to an end. Ensuring that it continued would absorb Spanish resources and prevent Spain from sending reinforcements. At the same time, England, France and the Dutch Republic were opening talks to end the 1665 to 1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War. English diplomats wanted a quick conclusion to the Portuguese Restoration War, hoping to create an Anglo-Spanish-Portuguese coalition against the Dutch, and thus obtain better terms. Louis wanted to block this, as such an alliance could interfere with his invasion plans. The treaty successfully achieved both aims and when the War of Devolution commenced on 24 May, France occupied most of the Spanish Netherlands with minimal interference, followed by Franche-Comté in 1668. However, other powers saw French expansion as a common threat; on 27 May 1667, Spain and England signed the Treaty of Madrid, and on 31 July, the Treaty of Breda ended the Anglo-Dutch War. The pro-French Portuguese chief minister, Count Castelo Melhor, was removed from office in September, and Spain and Portugal made peace in the February 1668 Treaty of Lisbon. This cleared the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between England, the Dutch Republic and Sweden, which forced France to return most of its conquests to Spain in the Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle. Background The treaty was designed to facilitate the French occupation of the Spanish Netherlands. The treaty was one of a series of agreements signed between 1662 and 1668 in response to changes in the European balance of power. France supported the Dutch Republic during the Eighty Years' War with Spain as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power. The war substantially weakened Spain, and the 1648 Peace of Münster confirmed Dutch independence and permanently closed the Scheldt estuary. It also gave Amsterdam control of imports and exports through Northwestern Europe and eliminated its closest rival, Antwerp. Retaining that monopoly became a Dutch priority. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the French finance minister, argued that Antwerp and the Spanish Netherlands were essential for France's economic growth. By 1663, Louis concluded that the Dutch would never make the concessions that he required and so he began preparations to seize the Spanish Netherlands. The treaty was intended to minimise Spain's ability to reinforce its garrisons. In 1581, the Crowns of Portugal and Spain were united under Philip II, but opposition to Spanish policies led to the Portuguese Restoration War in 1640. By the end of 1665, attempts to reconquer Portugal had clearly failed, and Spanish government finances had collapsed under the strain of paying for the war. The Crown declared bankruptcy seven times between 1643 and 1666. The death of Philip IV in September 1665 left his four- year-old-son as king and resulted in a struggle for control between Mariana of Austria and John of Austria. Maria Francisca of Savoy, whose marriage to Afonso was a preliminary to the agreement but proved unsuccessful. Afonso VI succeeded as king of Portugal in 1653; as he was physically impaired and mentally unstable, his mother, Luisa de Guzmán, controlled the government. In 1662, she was removed in a coup, organised by the Count of Castelo Melhor; Afonso made him chief minister and sent Luisa to a convent, where she died in February 1666. The Portuguese government was split into pro-French and pro- English factions, led respectively by Castelo Melhor and Afonso's younger brother, Pedro. In 1662, Charles II of England married Afonso's sister Catherine and provided military support, which, although limited, proved to be decisive in defeating the 1663-1665 Spanish offensive. After the Second Anglo- Dutch War began in 1665, English diplomats focused on building an Anglo- Portuguese-Spanish alliance against the Dutch, and they offered to mediate between both countries. Castelo Melhor suggested Charles' marriage to Catherine to be balanced by a French princess marrying into the Portuguese royal family. Maria Francisca of Savoy was selected for that role; she was first offered to Pedro, who turned her down, but then was accepted by Afonso. Louis persuaded Charles to agree by providing the unpaid portion of Catherine's dowry. Maria arrived in Portugal on 2 August 1666, accompanied by a new French ambassador, the Marquis de St Romain. The wedding took place the same day; Afonso left the festivities early and reportedly displayed a similar lack of interest in consummating the marriage. In the early stages of the Restoration War, Portugal had licensed English and Dutch privateers to operate against Spanish merchant shipping. The Dutch used the opportunity to attack Portuguese colonies. Under the 1661 Treaty of The Hague, Portugal gave up most of its territories in Asia but retained those in Brazil and Africa. Castelo Melhor and others within the Portuguese elite believed that a rupture between France and the Dutch Republic was inevitable and that a treaty with France would provide an opportunity to regain those losses. Terms For Louis, the treaty was a way to threaten Spain without declaring war. He argued that the Spanish Netherlands were his by right, making the War of Devolution a 'voyage'. Castelo Melhor hoped the French alliance would end the Restoration War on terms favourable to Portugal. There was also an agreement that if England formally ended the 1654-1660 Anglo-Spanish War, France would declare war on Spain within 30 months or pay the Portuguese 900,000 cruzados. Portugal would continue the war with Spain and, in return, would receive a subsidy of 600,000 cruzados a month. The treaty gave French merchants the same commercial advantages that had been granted to the English and Dutch. Louis also agreed to demand the return of Portuguese trading posts of Kannur and Kochi, in India, which had been seized by the Dutch in 1663. The parties also agreed not to make peace until Spain complied with Louis' claims in the Spanish Netherlands, which potentially required Portugal to continue the war for France's benefit. Although that was balanced by a French commitment to ensure the Portuguese regained any territories held by the Spanish, they had already achieved that in reality. Aftermath Afonso VI, deposed by Pedro and held in the Palace of Sintra. Louis achieved his objective of minimising interference with his occupation of the Spanish Netherlands, but other powers began to see France as a common threat. On 27 May, Spain and England signed the Treaty of Madrid, followed, on 31 July, by the Treaty of Breda, which ended the Anglo-Dutch War. That led to the 1668 Triple Alliance between England, the Dutch Republic and Sweden, which forced France to return most of its conquests in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Although Castelo Melhor considered the marriage and the treaty with France to be a triumph, Portugal was financially exhausted and needed to focus on rebuilding its trading networks. Many opposed an agreement that committed them to continuing the war on France's behalf, especially the clause preventing a separate peace. In addition, Maria was an intelligent and resolute individual who wanted to serve French interests and exercise real power. Afonso was controlled by Castelo Melhor, who had no intention of allowing that. She was thus driven to co- operate with her brother-in-law Pedro at first before she allegedly begin an affair with him. Maria persuaded Louis that Pedro was a better asset for furthering French interests. In September, Castelo Melhor was dismissed and went into exile in England, where he became an advisor to King Charles II. In January 1668, the Cortes appointed Pedro as regent, and Afonso spent the rest of his life in close confinement, initially the Azores and then the Palace of Sintra in Lisbon, where he died in 1683. That facilitated the February 1668 Treaty of Lisbon, which ended the war between Spain and Portugal. Maria retired to a convent and asked for her marriage to be annulled on the grounds of non-consummation. That was approved by her relative, Cardinal Vendôme. She then married Pedro in September 1668.

Under Arch Linux(-based ones) it can be obtained from community repositories.https://repology.org/project/puddletag The user interface is modeled after the popular Windows freeware Mp3tag. It uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags a user may want to edit by hand are visible and easily editable. All the other audio taggers available for Linux take a different approach to user interface design. The interface elements can be freely arranged. According to the popular prototypical Windows application, which it is supposed to replace under Linux, it is also regularly praised for its particularly large functionality and recommended for more demanding users. In July 2008, the first version (0.1) was released via SourceForge.https://sourceforge.net/projects/puddletag/files/puddletag/ The website counted several thousand downloads for each release before the project finally left the platform in early 2016 and was included in the package sources of most major Linux distributions. Version 1.0 was released in 2012, introducing support for AcoustID. Puddletag is written in Python 2.x and uses Qt 4 (through PyQt) for its graphical user interface. As backend it utilizes Mutagen, a Python module to handle audio metadata. Mutagen works on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 (CPython and PyPy) and has no dependencies outside the Python standard library. Features Mutagen supports ASF, FLAC, M4A, APE, MP3, MPC, Ogg Opus, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack, OptimFROG, and AIFF audio files.

It was released in 1979 by the record label Radar. By this time, Thompson had moved the project to London and expanded the band for this album to include Lora Logic of X-Ray Spex and Essential Logic and all of the members of Pere Ubu. \\\\-  Background  Since the release of God Bless the Red Krayola and All Who Sail With It, Steve Cunningham had left the project to pursue his own musical ambitions and had been replaced by Jesse Chamberlain. In 1978, this incarnation of the band was touring regularly and had been signed to Radar Records. While in Europe, Thompson met Pere Ubu, who were touring in support of The Modern Dance, and struck up a friendship.  Composition  Despite the presence of Pere Ubu, the music is a close continuation of the sound previously established by The Red Crayola. Soldier-Talk was conceived as a concept album dealing with militarism. Chamberlain wanted to veer the music towards a more pop-oriented direction while Thompson opted to keep the sound experimental. As Thompson explained, \\"There wasn't much for him to do, in a way, I think he wanted to say what he felt about the record, and he wanted it closer in the direction of pop, because Jesse, that's always been one of his gifts, and I was determined to make the record work, and thought that it could, and should, and working with Geoff Travis, using his insights into the way music works, there was no other way it could be...\\" The conflict caused a strain on their musical partnership, although they later worked again on another record in a similar vein, Three Songs on a Trip to America, the cover of which referenced Soldier-Talk.  Release  Soldier-Talk was released in 1979. Around the release of the album, Mayo Thompson became an active producer for many of the bands on the Rough Trade roster, including Stiff Little Fingers, The Fall and The Raincoats. He also became a member Pere Ubu, filling the spot left after Tom Herman's departure, and recorded the albums The Art of Walking and Song of the Bailing Man with the group.  Reception  Thom Jurek of AllMusic declared it \\"among the loopiest of the Red Krayola's offerings\\", and representative of \\"post-punk's more musically adventurous side\\". He gave the album three out of five stars, describing the songs as being independently compelling and engaging. Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork gave the album 5.3 out of 10 and was critical towards the overall abrasiveness of the music, writing, \\"It's a consistently interesting album – there's something trying to get your attention at every moment, but in the manner of a beloved little sibling who won't stop poking you.\\" He concluded that the record was best suited for those who find Gang of Four's Entertainment! too subdued.

Highly intelligent and very familiar with traditional Chinese medicine, he was an able assistant to the upright official Bao Zheng. Background Proficient in Chinese classics with a sharp mind, Gongsun Ce nevertheless failed the imperial examination multiple times. (Although not clearly stated, the novel implied his failures were due to other candidates bribing corrupt chief examiners like Pang Ji.) He found refuge at a monastery and was treated well by the abbot, who eventually recommended him to the newly appointed Kaifeng prefect Bao Zheng. After reading the abbot's reference letter and interviewing him, Bao took Gongsun as his assistant. Familiarity with medicine As Gongsun Ce studied medicine, he was able to investigate cases by disguising himself as a wandering doctor carrying a medicine kit and a quack's banner. If he was invited to a patient's family, he would ask questions related to the case during the diagnosis. He would also personally perform autopsy when needed for his investigations. According to the novel, Gongsun Ce was able to correctly diagnose a woman's pregnancy as well as depression by taking her pulse. He prescribed her a prescription to prevent miscarriage and invigorate circulation. Gongsun Ce also cured a madman with his \\"Five-wood Decoction\\": boiled water containing woods from mulberry, elm, peach, pagoda trees and willow. The patient was put in the decoction bath, covered with blankets except for his face, and after perspiring all over recovered from his insanity. Inventions Gongsun Ce designed a set of three guillotines for Bao, decorated with a dog's head, a tiger's head and a dragon's head to execute commoners, government officials and imperial personages respectively. Using his knowledge of anatomy, Gongsun Ce also invented a torture instrument called \\"Apricot Flower Raindrops\\". It was a large flat piece of iron studded with small buttons. When made red-hot, the buttons would burn the skin of an accused placed on the instrument; however, the injuries would not be fatal.

Early life Prince Mansour was born in 1921. He is widely believed to be the ninth son of Ibn Saud, but William A. Eddy argues that Prince Mansour is the sixth son of Ibn Saud. His mother was an Armenian woman, Shahida (died 1938), who was reportedly the favorite wife of Ibn Saud. She was of Christian origin. Prince Mansour had two full brothers, Prince Mishaal and Prince Mutaib, and a full sister, Princess Qumash, who died on 26 September 2011. Career Prince Mansour was the emir of Murabba Palace in 1943. He officially visited Cairo. Ibn Saud sent him there to support the Indian Muslim officers and men just before the Battle of El Alamein. Then he was appointed minister of defense by Ibn Saud on 10 November 1943 when office was established. Therefore, he is the first defense minister of Saudi Arabia. Prince Muhammad and Prince Mansour accompanied Ibn Saud in the latter's meeting with the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 14 February 1945. He also participated in Ibn Saud's meeting with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Egypt in February 1945. Prince Mansour's term as defense minister lasted until his death in 1951, and he was replaced by his full brother Prince Mishaal who had been his deputy at the ministry. Personal life Prince Mansour was married and had two children, Talal and Muhdi. Prince Talal (born 1951) was raised by his uncle Prince Mutaib following the death of his father. Prince Mutaib's daughter, Princess Nouf, married Prince Talal who was made a member of Allegiance Council in December 2007. Prince Mansour's daughter, Mudhi, published a book entitled Al Hijar Wa Natayjiha Fi 'Asir Al Malik 'Abdul'Aziz in 1993. Death Prince Mansour died of a heart attack in Paris on 2 May 1951. However, an USA diplomatic cable dated 2006 claims that he died of alcohol poisoning after a party hosted by his older half-brother, then governor of Riyadh Nasser bin Abdulaziz. It is further reported that upon hearing of this event, Ibn Saud threw Prince Nasser in jail, and he subsequently lost his post and never returned to public life. Concerning the cause of Prince Mansour's death there is another report arguing that he died of kidney disease. Prince Mansour was buried in Al Adl cemetery, Mecca.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Vic. It has a mix of Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque and Neoclassic styles. History Romanesque bell tower of the Cathedral of Vic. In the first place, the sculpture of Abat Oliba. A cathedral in Vic appears documented in the year 516, though it was destroyed during an Arab raid in 717-718. It was rebuilt in 886 when the count Wilfred the Hairy repopulated the area. It was remodeled by Abat Oliba in the 11th century in Romanesque style, building the same bell tower and crypt which are still standing nowadays. The crypt still has the pre-Romanesque capitals. The cloister dates from the 14th century and its built in Gothic style, while some chapels were built later in Baroque style. =Santa Maria la Rodona= It was the first cathedral church in Vic, named St. Peter the Apostle or Santa Maria la Rodona. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass at Santa Maria and the third at St. Peter's. The very old church of Santa Maria was reconstructed from the foundations by the canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and was consecrated forty years later by the bishop Pere de Redorta . He landed in 1787 to make room for the new cathedral. It was in the present Square of the Cathedral, in front of the facade: on the pavement you can see the circle that marks its location, found as a result of recent excavations that left the foundations in the open. =The Cathedral of Oliba= Inside the Cathedral of Vic, with the ships and paintings of Sert The cathedral, with a single nave, thick walls and few windows, was replaced by the one that Abbot Oliba, bishop of Vic between 1018 and 1046, built in Romanesque style. It was consecrated in 1038 by Archbishop Guifré de Narbonne. The bell tower, 46 meters away, was separated from the ship. From this building the bell tower and the crypt are preserved, whose capitals are from the previous temple. In addition, in the Episcopal Museum of Vic, there are some reliefs with figures from the Romanesque portal and capitals of the cloister, of great sculptural quality. Two hundred years later, Ramon d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter urging the faithful to contribute to the repair of the building. The cloister dates back to the 14th century, in Gothic style. It was started in 1318. Including the altarpiece of the main altar, finished by Pere Oller in 1428. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Saint John opened. =The current cathedral= Before 1787, the cathedral shared its importance with Church of Santa Maria la Rodona. It was located nearby the nowadays cathedral, but finally it was demolished to enlarge the one standing nowadays. The first stone of the new church was laid on September 24, 1781 and was consecrated on September 15, 1803. The project is the work of the vigatà Josep Moretó i Codina, in neoclassical style. This is the present building. In 1891, the Episcopal Museum of Vic opened in front of the headquarters, with works that belonged to the Cathedral. Already in the 20th century, Josep Maria Sert was commissioned to decorate the walls and ceilings of the interior. Sert finished the paintings on all the walls in 1930 and, in 1931, the cathedral was declared Historic Artistic Monument. Shortly after, during the Spanish Civil War, the cathedral was burned and part of the building sank. Restored, Josep Maria Sert re-painted the walls, since the paintings had been totally destroyed. This new version of the oils was finished in 1945. Architecture Figure of Sant Pere, with a key in his hand, by Joan Seguranyes It is a building of a severe and cold neoclassical style, excessively academic. It combines Doric and Tuscan styles, with a white stone facade enriched with a balustrade. The facade of the cathedral dates from the remodeling of 1803 , in a neoclassical style. On the upper part there is a central rosette, decorated with Romanesque archivolts that are used by the old cathedral, and flanked by two windows. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three ships; The central one is the most ornate, with pilasters and pediment, and the sculpture of Saint Peter, patron saint of the temple. The bell tower, on the corner of the Gospel (left), dates back to the middle of the 11th century, with Romanesque Lombard features. With a square floor plan, it maintains the shape from the foundation at the top, 46 meters high. It is divided into six floors, separated by stone strips of Lombard arches between which there are windows. In general, the project is not very successful, the obvious disproportion between the elements and the architectural ornamentation is poor and routine, as well as contradicting some principles of the application of classical orders. =Interior= Apse with paintings. The interior consists of three ships of the same height, separated by Corinthian pilasters (with clearly disproportionate dimensions between the architrave shards and the set of capitals and pillars), a pronounced transept, a semicircular vault deck and a dome in the cruise, and the polygonal apse. The side naves have series of two chapels under each round of vaults. =Paintings by Sert= In the first half of the 20th century, the decoration of the great white walls was commissioned by the Catalan painter Josep Maria Sert, who worked between 1926 and 1930, when he finished them and presented the project for the paintings of the vaults. It was, as was customary, large oil-painted canvases were placed on the walls. The 1936 fire, at the beginning of the Civil War (1936-1939), destroyed Sert's work - many graphic documents are preserved - and considerably damaged the vaults and the dome of the ship. Just after the war the repair works of the Cathedral began, the crypt was discovered again, and the ambulatory was built. Josep Maria Sert carried out a new decoration, which we can contemplate today, between 1939 and 1945, when he died, reinterpreting some of the old ones and making new ones. In general, the style of the second version is less colorful. Like the first version, they are huge canvases set on the walls of the cathedral. With the characteristic style of Sert, the masses and voluminous figures predominate, with great force, with a great contrast of chiaroscuro. Almost monochromatic, it emphasizes in the painting the golden colors and the ranges of brown and ocher, with touches of red. The game of volumes and this chromatic treatment makes a sense of depth. The iconography program responds to a cycle of the mystery of redemption (in the first version, it focused on the exaltation of Christ and the Church). In the polyps of the apse, which follows the polygonal plant, the crucifixion of the Lord is seen, between the scenes of his burial and ascension. The four scenes of the cycle regarding the loss of original justice and the fall of Adam and Eve continue on the walls of the cruise. On the arches of the side chapels, scenes of the martyrdom of the apostles and evangelists are developed. In the triptych formed by the walls of the feet of the cathedral, the subjects that represent Jesus expelling the merchants of the temple are opposed, and he himself coming out with the cross on the shoulder, flanking the central scene that represents the sentence pronounced by Pilate. On the lunettes of the overcrowding, when Joseph Maria Sert, his assistant, Miquel Massot i Tetas, reproduced the songs of the Beatitudes that his master had made in the decoration destroyed by the burning of 1936. In 1947 the painter Felip Vall i Verdaguer won the competition to decorate the vaults of the cathedral, which were still pending decoration. The project did not materialize due to lack of funding. A model and several sketches and preparatory drawings are preserved in this project. =Sport= The main altarpiece of alabaster, dated between 1420 and 1427, is the main wall of the girola, the work of Pere Oller dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter. It was given at the beginning of the fifteenth century, by Bernard Despujol. Next, we find the tomb of the founder, Bishop Oliba. =Capelles= On the north side of the headquarters there are a number of Baroque chapels, which are the only part built of a project from the beginning of the 17th century to a new cathedral. In particular, the chapel of Sant Bernat Calbó, under the bell tower, is the work of the architect of Mataró Jaume Vendrell (1633). Saint Bernat Calbó had been bishop of Vic between 1233 and 1243 and participated with James I of Aragon in the conquest of Valencia. His body rests on a large silver-plated ballot box, the work of the goldsmith Joan Matons made between 1700 and 1728. In the chapel of the Virgin of Montserrat is the tomb of Bishop Josep Torras i Bages and a lying Christ of Josep Llimona i Bruguera. =Crypt= Crypt of the cathedral. The crypt dates from the Romanesque cathedral consecrated in 1038. The capitals are still older, since they took advantage of the ancient pre- Romanesque cathedral. =Cloister= Regarding the primitive cloister , it is divided into two floors, a Romanesque inferior from the 12th century and a Gothic superior from the 14th century built by the teachers Despuig, Lardenosa and Valls. In great beauty, it has a unique gallery with double windows, open in the interior of the cloister and out in the city. It also conserves the gothic door that leads to the chapter room. The lower cloister opens the chapter room consecrated in 1360, with a rectangular ground plan covered by an octagonal vault with a small square apse in the background. In the center of the cloister we find the grave of the Catalan philosopher born in Vic Jaume Balmes, crowned by a statue made in 1853 by Josep Bover, for the cemetery of the city, and moved to the cloister in 1865.

Additionally, since all of the show's writers were stand-up comedians, many often appeared as correspondents who performed monologues. As the last segment of the program, Bell interviewed a celebrity guest. In order to ensure the show's topicality, most of the show was taped on the day that it was broadcast.

The series' first official short, \\"Singachu: A Pikachu Song\\", premiered on YouTube on June 7, 2011. Since launching, the series has partnered with Disney Digital Network, Maker Studios, and at one point with IGN Entertainment. Each regular Random Encounters short consists of an original musical number (mostly performed by live costumed actors recreating scenes or starring as characters from a popular video game series, such as Super Mario Bros, Pokémon or Five Nights at Freddy's). The creators were first inspired to found the series in 2010, when their Sonic the Hedgehog musical parody won the grand prize in an international video competition hosted by Sega. Since launching their YouTube series, Random Encounters has traveled to various festivals and conventions to perform live. History \\"Random Encounters\\" was initially conceived during a Sega-sponsored contest, for which AJ Pinkerton co-developed the winning entry and his first video game parody song, \\"Needlemouse: The Musical\\". The Needlemouse song was requested by Sega to be performed live at their 2011 Sonic Boom community event, where AJ Pinkerton and Peter Srinivasan first recognized the demand for their product and began development on a series of popular games as musical numbers. Style Random Encounters music videos are generally family-friendly and often written to be cleverly self-censored, such as utilizing creative alternatives to obscenities and disregarding the rhyming scheme abruptly to dodge profanity. Shorts based on mature content, such as Assassin's Creed, Five Nights at Freddy's and Dead Space, typically present light-hearted versions of the characters, rather than their colder in-game incarnations. Musical styles for each short vary but often consist of bouncy rhythms and upbeat tempos. Some songs borrow heavily from other sources, such as Disney numbers or in-game themes. The series' derives much of its humor from each song's lyrics, which often refer to in-game events, pop culture or internet memes. While most videos are performed with live-action setups, some songs feature 2D, 3D, and stopmotion animation.

It is typically seen in a long black coat and hat, with a thick yellow beard entirely obscuring its face. The Beard does not speak English but instead prefers to make \\"oogh\\" sounds. When appearing at conventions, the Beard keeps a stash of marshmallows, which it throws when spotted by fans. On YouTube, viewers often post timecodes for the Beard's appearances in each video's comments section as pointers for other viewers. Few people besides the Sweeping Man are said to have lived through a Beard attack. *Eisenstein McBones is a grouchy half-torso human skeleton (referred to as a \\"Stalfos\\" in the series). He wears various costumes and hats depending on the occasion and is most frequently associated with his boss, Ganondorf. Eisenstein often uses the term \\"meat-sack\\", both as a synonym for \\"human\\" and as an expletive. *The Sweeping Man, also known as the Minesweeper, is a mysterious, fedora-clad man who appears recurrently sweeping the floors in RE videos. Sweeping Man rarely speaks, even in live Random Encounters performances; he is stated to have supernatural capabilities and to have trained as a ninja. Allegedly, he is one of very few humans to have survived an attack from The Beard. In \\"Five Nights At Freddy's: The Musical\\", Nathan Sharp told Mark Fischbach that The Sweeping Man (who had three rounds of ammunition shot into his chest by Mark at Night 2, mistaking him as Foxy), was in a stable condition. *The Giant Crazy Snake is a bearded sock puppet, first featured in \\"The Legend of Ganondorf\\" and later in cameos in many other musicals, including as Arts and Crafters in \\"The Baldi's Basics Musical.\\" Many of his appearances end with a special message, warning kids against reckless behaviors \\"without parental supervision\\". The Giant Crazy Snake is also shown to be an accomplished cage-fighter. Corporate relationships =Sega= After \\"Needlemouse: The Musical\\" won top honors in their Sonic Birthday contest, Sega arranged to have the Random Encounters team perform an alternate version at Sonic Boom 2011, this time highlighting the Modern Sonic/Classic Sonic chemistry from Sonic Generations. Nine months later, Random Encounters co-produced a musical game trailer for the fictitious title \\"Sega Bass Fishing of the Dead\\" as part of Sega's online April Fools' prank.

It is based on the novel A Dangerous Game by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. Plot Alfredo Rossi, a tax-evading Italian businessman, drives to Switzerland to deposit 100 million lire. He has miscalculated the timing, and the banks have already closed. Then he notices a mysterious black-clad woman on a motorcycle. He begins following her through the mountain roads until his car suddenly breaks down. Seeking help, he goes to a nearby castle where he is greeted by the owner, Count de La Brunetière. The count, a former defense attorney, invites Rossi to stay for dinner and participate in a game with Brunetière’s three friends, all retired jurists. The game in question is a pretend trial in which Rossi will play the defendant. Rossi is reluctant to accept the invitation but then he sees Simonetta, a beautiful maidservant, and decides to stay. During the cross- examination by the prosecutor Zorn, it transpires that Rossi may have caused the death of his boss from a heart attack. He also carried on an affair with the boss’ wife. Zorn then charges Rossi with premeditated murder. After heated closing arguments, the judge sentences him to death. The retired agents of justice then thank Rossi for being a good sport, and he is escorted to his room. The next morning he is presented with a bill for the dinner and the accompanying entertainment. He pays in cash and drives away. Then he sees the mysterious motorcycle rider again. He starts pursuing her but ends up dying in a car crash. Cast *Alberto Sordi: Alfredo Rossi * Michel Simon: Prosecutor Zorn * Charles Vanel: Judge Dutz * Claude Dauphin: Chancellor Bouisson * Pierre Brasseur: Count de la Brunetière * Janet Agren: Simonetta *Giuseppe Maffioli: Pilet Reception TV Guide wrote that \\"the film combines humor with compelling drama, which sustains viewer interest until the verdict is delivered. The irony throughout the film is typical of the oblique way Durrenmatt, the Swiss master of stagecraft, looks at the world and, in particular, the helplessness of the individual in that world.\\" Carlo Testa called it \\"a transitional feature\\" between Scola’s early films and his later, more complex ones, and one of the best examples of the Italian tragicomedy of all times. Brian Mills commented that \\"the film plays like an Agatha Christie whodunit with lots of twists and unexpected laughs\\" and added that \\"Sordi is at his best.\\" References External links * Category:1972 films Category:1972 comedy-drama films Category:Commedia all'italiana Category:Italian films Category:French films Category:Films directed by Ettore Scola Category:Films based on works by Friedrich Dürrenmatt Category:Films set in Switzerland Category:Italian satirical films Category:French satirical films Category:Courtroom films Category:Italian black comedy films Category:Films set in country houses Category:Films produced by Dino De Laurentiis Category:1972 comedy films Category:1972 drama films ","title":"The Most Wonderful Evening of My Life"},{"id":"36684294","text":"Peter Vaudreuil Lamarque (; born 21 May 1948) is a British aesthethician and philosopher of art, working in the analytic tradition.

He earned a call-up to represent Serie C1/A against Serie C1/B, which the team won the tournament. ;Sampdoria (loan) N.Ferari scored 4 goals in 7 games for Sampdoria reserve in 2007–08 season, as joint-third scorer of the team (along with Guido Marilungo and Stefano Scappini), behind Salvatore Foti (8 goals in half season) and Moussa Diarra (5 goals). However, he did not play any game in the playoff (but Gabriel Ferrari did) except the final. N.Ferrari was the second top-scorer of Sampdoria reserve in 2008–09 season, behind Marilungo. That season Sampdoria was eliminated in the postseason playoffs in the round 16 (first round) by Palermo. The teams draw 3–3 in aggregate but Palermo had more away goal. Ferrari scored once in these three goals. Ferrari also scored 4 goals for the runner-up of 2009 Torneo di Viareggio. =Lega Pro clubs= Since 2009 Ferrari was farmed to Lega Pro clubs in co-ownership deal, namely Viareggio (swap with Alessio Cristiani), Fano (for €500; €10,000 bought back), South Tyrol (for €500), Foligno and Aprilia. Ferrari only scored regularly in the Lega Pro Second Division, the fourth highest level of Italy, for Manfredonia (January–June 2010), Fano (July 2010–June 2011) and Aprilia (July 2012–June 2013).

Its distinguishing feature from earlier SPARC iterations is the introduction of chip multithreading (CMT) technology, a multithreading, multicore design intended to drive greater processor utilization at lower power consumption. The first generation T-series processor, the UltraSPARC T1, and servers based on it, were announced in December 2005. As later generations were introduced, the term \\"T series\\" was used to refer to the entire family of processors. Pre- Oracle era Sun Microsystems' Sun Fire and SPARC Enterprise product lines were based on early generations of CMT technology. The UltraSPARC T1 based Sun Fire T2000 and T1000 servers were launched in December 2005 and early 2006, respectively. They were later rebranded to match the name of the UltraSPARC T2 and T2 Plus based Sun SPARC Enterprise T50 servers.  SPARC T3  In September 2010, Oracle announced a range of SPARC T3 processor based servers. These are branded as the \\"SPARC T3\\" series, the \\"SPARC Enterprise\\" brand being dropped. The SPARC T3-series servers include the T3-1B, a blade server module that fits into the Sun Blade 6000 system. All other T3 based servers are rack mounted systems. Subsequent T-series server generations also include a blade server in the same Sun Blade 6000 form factor.  SPARC T4  On September 26, 2011, Oracle announced a range of SPARC T4-based servers. These systems use the same chassis as the earlier T3 based systems. Their main features are very similar, with the exception of: * T4 CPU instead of T3 CPU, with complete core redesign * doubled RAM capacity * small changes in mass storage capacity  SPARC T5  On March 26, 2013, Oracle announced refreshed SPARC servers based on the new SPARC T5 microprocessor, which the company claims is \\"the world's fastest\\". In the T5 range of servers, the single socket rackmount server design was deprecated, while a new eight-socket rackmount server was introduced.  SPARC M7  On October 26, 2015, Oracle announced a family of systems built on the 32-core, 256-thread SPARC M7 microprocessor. Unlike prior generations, both T- and M-series systems were introduced using the same processor.  Partitioning and virtualization  SPARC T-series servers can be partitioned using Oracle's Logical Domains technology. Additional virtualization is provided by Oracle Solaris Zones (aka Solaris Containers) to create isolated virtual servers within a single operating system instance. Logical Domains and Solaris Zones can be used together to increase server utilization. Servers { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! Model ! RU ! Max processors ! Processor frequency ! Max memory !

She was among the handful of female nuclear physics pioneers at the beginning of the 20th century, established the first practical courses of particle physics in Bulgaria and was the first woman to hold a professorial title in the country.  Early life  Elisabeth Karamichailova was born in 1897 in Vienna, to Ivan Mikhaylov and Mary Slade. Both her parents had studied at the University of Vienna - Ivan, born in Shumen, was studying medicine, while Mary, a native of Minster Lovell in Oxfordshire, studied music. After her father graduated in 1907, the family remained in Vienna for two years before moving to Bulgaria in 1909 where they acquired a spacious house in central Sofia. Karamichailova grew up in both an artistic and scientific environment. Her father turned the upper floor of his house into a Red Cross Hospital where he treated his patients without requiring payment. She enrolled in the Sofia Girls' College and graduated there in 1917, after which she departed to study at the University of Vienna.  Studies in radioactivity  In 1922 Karamichailova graduated as a PhD in Physics and Mathematics. She wrote her thesis, entitled \\"About Electric Figures on Different Materials, Especially On Crystals\\"German: \\"Über elektrische Figuren auf verschiedenen Materialien, insbesondere auf Kristallen\\" under the direction of Karl Przibram. Karamichailova continued her work at the Institute for Radium Studies afterwards, becoming particularly interested in radioluminescence. She cooperated with Marietta Blau in the study of polonium, and later researched methods for neutron bombardment of thorium.Rayner-Canham, p.206 Karamichailova simultaneously attended courses in electronic and radio engineering at the Vienna Polytechnic. In the autumn of 1923 she returned briefly to Bulgaria and worked as a \\"guest fellow\\" at the Physics Institute of Sofia University. Soon Karamichailova went back to Vienna and began her work on the transmutation of light elements under alpha radiation at the Institute of Radium Studies. In 1931, Karamichailova and Marietta Blau observed a specific type of previously unknown radiation emitted from polonium, which would later be confirmed by James Chadwick as neutron radiation, leading to his discovery of neutrons. In 1933 the position of \\"research assistant\\", under which she worked in Vienna, was terminated. Karamichailova had to continue her research without tuition until 1935, when she obtained a 3-year Alfred Yarrow Research Fellowship from Girton College, Cambridge. She was subsequently employed at the Cavendish Laboratory. In December 1937, she applied for a position as a docent in Experimental Physics at Sofia University. Karamichailova managed to extend her scholarship by 10 months, and finally returned to Bulgaria in 1939, where she was appointed as a docent of Experimental Atomistics with Radioactivity at SU. She set up an atomic physics course, introducing the latest knowledge from her studies in Austria and England and some of her equipment. The outbreak of World War II halted any further expansion of nuclear research activities. Her studies now involved cosmic rays as well. Karamichailova used photographic plates to continue her work in this field, which she had collaborated on with Marietta Blau. She attempted to continue the study of multiple ionization, but this was impossible without the sophisticated equipment she had access to while in England. When Karamichailova began her work in Sofia in 1940, she only had a microscope and a dark room.Rayner-Canham, p.207  Later life  After the left-wing uprising in 1944, the newly established far-left authorities in Bulgaria labeled Karamichailova as \\"unreliable\\" due to her anti-communist views and prohibited her from going abroad.

A former member of the Thomanerchor, he is particularly known for the part of the Evangelist in oratorios and Passions of Johann Sebastian Bach.  Career  Petzold was born in Leipzig, the son of the theologian Ernst Petzold. He received his first musical education as a member of the Thomanerchor, where he was a member from 1965 to 1974, at the same time as Georg Christoph Biller. His father, his brother and later his son Jakob were also choir members. As Petzold initially refused to join the army, the East German authorities denied him the right to study music. He served for 18 months and then studied voice from 1979 to 1985 at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig with Eva Schubert and Bernd Siegfried Weber. He wanted to sing in an opera chorus, but while still a student was engaged as a soloist in Halberstadt and Altenburg. In 1985 he became a member of the Landestheater Halle. He appeared regularly at the Leipzig Opera from 1986, and has been a permanent member of the ensemble since 1988.

He partnered with Liam Heath in the men's kayak double 200m sprint event, and they have won a bronze in K-2 200 at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and a silver at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the same event. They have also won gold at the European Championships three times as well as silver and bronze medals at the World Championships. Schofield was a member of the Soar Valley Canoe Club and coached by Alex Nikonorov. Early life and education Schofield was born in Petersfield, Hampshire to Maggie and Peter Schofield. The family moved to Spain when he was six, where he took up taekwondo and later judo. After coming back to Clitheroe, Lancashire, he was introduced to canoeing when he was nine in a taster session through the Chatburn Cubs. He initially competed in the cub scout racing league, later he took up wildwater racing. Schofield attended Clitheroe Royal Grammar School from 1996 to 2003. He studied Human Biology at Loughborough University, but took two years out in an attempt to get to the 2008 Beijing Games. He graduated in June 2010. and He also has an MSc in Applied Physiotherapy and Biomechanics from Brunel University. He resides in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Career Schofield was active in wild water canoeing as a junior, and made it into the national junior team. He won the Junior World Championships in Bala, North Wales in 2002. He was the overall World Cup winner in 2006. He became European champion in 2007. Schofield switched to flatwater sprint in 2007 as wild-water sprint canoeing events are not part of the Olympic Games, and he considered becoming an Olympic champion his ultimate goal. In the flatwater sprint kayaking discipline, he competed with Ben Brown in the 500m K2 at the 2007 World Championships, but in finishing in 9th place, they failed to qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. =2010–2011= Schofield partnered up with Liam Heath in the sprint double event after Heath decided to return to the sport in 2009. In their first season competing together in 2010 they won gold medals in the K2 200m at the 2nd World Cup in Szeged and the 3rd World Cup in Duisburg and became European Champions in July 2010. They won two medals at the 2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in Poznań with a silver in the K-1 4 x 200m relay and a bronze in the K-2 200m event. In the 2011 international season Schofield and Heath won two silver medals at World Cups 1 and 2 at Poznan and Račice and retained their K2 200m title at the European Championships in Belgrade in June 2011.

It has also been found in the sea around Antarctica. M. tardigradum was described by Louis Michel François Doyère in 1840. It contains unidentified osmolytes that could potentially provide important information in the process of cryptobiosis. Description =Morphology= M. tardigradum has a symmetrical body with a total of eight legs; it uses claws, a distinctive feature for this tardigrade species. The total length of the body varies, with some measuring up to 0.7 mm in length. M. tardigradum has been found to have a high level of radioresistance. In 2007, individuals of two tardigrade species, Richtersius coronifer and M. tardigradum, were subject to the radiation, near-vacuum and near-absolute zero conditions of outer space as part of the European Space Agency's Biopan-6 experiment. Three specimens of M. tardigradum survived. The M. tardigradum is able to cope with high amounts of environmental stress by initiating cryptobiosis. During this state, the internal organic clock of M. tardigradum halts, thus the cryptobiotic state does not contribute to the aging process. =Nutrition= M. tardigradum is an omnivorous predator. It typically feeds on other small organisms such as algae, rotifers, and nematodes. Cases also have been recorded of M. tardigradum feeding on other smaller tardigrades. Evolution M. tardigradum has been phylogenetically linked to arthropods. Although the extent of the relationship is still debated, evidence suggests that tardigrades and arthropods have a close evolutionary history. Recent research has shown a shortage in a particular subset of genes also found in nematodes, another member of the Ecdysozoa superphylum. Habitat The biogeographical distribution of M. tardigradum is large. The species occupies mostly aquatic environments such as marine, coastal, and terrestrial areas. The full distribution of M. tardigradum is difficult to analyze due to the difficulty in taxonomy and the lack of sufficient data. Reproduction and development M. tardigradum reproduces both sexually and through parthenogenesis. The mating behavior of tardigrades is difficult to reproduce under artificial conditions, hence the frequency and time of reproduction is not fully understood. If and when a mating season exists for M. tardigradum is unknown. Females lay up to 12 eggs, which hatch after several days (around five to sixteen). The development of the newly hatched larvae is marked by various molting stages, rather than metamorphosis. The time frame of these molting stages vary from each tardigrade as it is dependent on the nutrition of the specific individual. Once the molting stages are complete, the larva tardigrade attempts to find an ideal location to initiate ecdysis. Some eggs may be left in the discarded exuvia. Tardigrades have been shown to respond to different temperature changes at different developmental stages. Specifically, the younger the egg, the less likely it is to survive extreme environments. However, not too long after development, tardigrades demonstrate a remarkable ability to withstand these conditions. To survive such conditions, tardigrades need time to develop important cellular structures and repair mechanisms.

It was published in the UK in September 2012 by the Fourth Estate imprint of HarperCollins, and in the United States in February 2013 by Faber and Faber. Goldacre argues in the book that \\"the whole edifice of medicine is broken\\", because the evidence on which it is based is systematically distorted by the pharmaceutical industry. He writes that the industry finances most of the clinical trials into its own products and much of doctors' continuing education, that clinical trials are often conducted on small groups of unrepresentative subjects and negative data is routinely withheld, and that apparently independent academic papers may be planned and even ghostwritten by pharmaceutical companies or their contractors, without disclosure.Bad Pharma, x–xi, 287ff; \\"Pick your pill out of a hat\\", The Economist, 29 September 2012. Describing the situation as a \\"murderous disaster\\", he makes suggestions for action by patients' groups, physicians, academics and the industry itself.Bad Pharma, xii, 357ff. Responding to the book's publication, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry issued a statement in 2012 arguing that the examples the book offers were historical, that the concerns had been addressed, that the industry is among the most regulated in the world, and that it discloses all data in accordance with international standards.\\"ABPI statement on Ben Goldacre's book 'Bad Pharma'\\" , Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, 5 October 2012.

As of 2014 he was Wellcome Research Fellow in Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Ben Goldacre, \\"About\\", badscience.net. Goldacre is known for his \\"Bad Science\\" column in the Guardian, which he has written since 2003, and for his first book, Bad Science (2008). This unpicked the claims of several forms of alternative medicine, and criticized certain physicians and the media for a lack of critical thinking. It also looked at the MMR vaccine controversy, AIDS denialism, the placebo effect and the misuse of statistics.Ben Goldacre, Bad Science, Harper Perennial, 2008. Goldacre was recognized in June 2013 by Health Service Journal as having done \\"more than any other single individual to shine a light on how science and research gets distorted by the media, politicians, quacks, PR and the pharmaceutical industry.\\"\\"Nick Black and Ben Goldacre named among clinical leaders making greatest impact\\", London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 12 June 2013. \\"Clinical Leaders 2013\\", Health Service Journal, 14 June 2013. Synopsis =Introduction= Goldacre writes in the introduction of Bad Pharma that he aims to defend the following: > Drugs are tested by the people who manufacture them, in poorly designed > trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and > analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, in such a way that > they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials > tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up > results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them > from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any > drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from > early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to > doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted > evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion. In their > forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about > what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or > journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often > undisclosed – and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And > finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often > covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, > without disclosure.

Aside from all this, for several of the most > important and enduring problems in medicine, we have no idea what the best > treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any > trials at all.Bad Pharma, xi (paragraph break added for ease of reading). =Chapter 1: \\"Missing Data\\"= In \\"Missing Data,\\" Goldacre argues that the clinical trials undertaken by drug companies routinely reach conclusions favourable to the company. For example, in a 2007 journal article published in PLOS Medicine, researchers studied every published trial on statins, drugs prescribed to reduce cholesterol levels. In the 192 trials they looked at, industry-funded trials were 20 times more likely to produce results that favoured the drug.Bad Pharma, 2; for the study, He writes that these positive results are achieved in a number of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have no idea what the effects are of the drugs they prescribe.Bad Pharma, 4–7, 12. An example he gives of the difficulty of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta- analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.Bad Pharma, 81ff; Tom Jefferson, et al., \\"A review of unpublished regulatory information from trials of neuraminidase inhibitors (Tamiflu - oseltamivir and Relenza - zanamivir) for influenza\\", Cochrane Summaries, 17 October 2012. =Chapter 2: \\"Where Do New Drugs Come From?\\"= In the second chapter, the book describes the process as new drugs move from animal testing through phase 1 (first-in-man study), phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 participants are referred to as volunteers, but in the US are paid $200–$400 per day, and because studies can last several weeks and subjects may volunteer several times a year, earning potential becomes the main reason for participation.Bad Pharma, 104–110. Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs). The rate of growth for clinical trials in India is 20 percent a year, in Argentina 27 percent, and in China 47 percent, while trials in the UK have fallen by 10 percent a year and in the US by six percent.Bad Pharma, 113–114. The shift to outsourcing raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, the meaning of informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, the extent to which corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also raises the question of whether the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same as patients diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.Bad Pharma, 115. There have also been cases of available treatment being withheld during clinical trials. In 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, the drug company Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that was known to be effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial. Goldacre writes that 11 children died, divided almost equally between the two groups. The families taking part in the trial were apparently not told that the competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available from Médecins Sans Frontières in the next-door building.Bad Pharma, 117. =Chapter 3: \\"Bad Regulators\\"= Chapter three describes the concept of \\"regulatory capture,\\" whereby a regulator – such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States – ends up advancing the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public. Goldacre writes that this happens for a number of reasons, including the revolving door of employees between the regulator and the companies, and the fact that friendships develop between regulator and company employees simply because they have knowledge and interests in common. The chapter also discusses surrogate outcomes and accelerated approval, and the difficulty of having ineffective drugs removed from the market once they have been approved.Bad Pharma, 123ff. He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.Bad Pharma, 143ff. =Chapter 4: \\"Bad Trials\\"= \\"Bad Trials\\" examines the ways in which clinical trials can be flawed. Goldacre writes that this happens by design and by analysis, and that it has the effect of maximizing a drug's benefits and minimizing harm. There have been instances of fraud, though he says these are rare. More common are what he calls the \\"wily tricks, close calls, and elegant mischief at the margins of acceptability.\\"Bad Pharma, 171. These include testing drugs on unrepresentative, \\"freakishly ideal\\" patients; comparing new drugs to something known to be ineffective, or effective at a different dose or if used differently; conducting trials that are too short or too small; and stopping trials early or late.Bad Pharma, 176, 180–187, 191–193. It also includes measuring uninformative outcomes; packaging the data so that it is misleading; ignoring patients who drop out (i.e. using per-protocol analysis, where only patients who complete the trial are counted in the final results, rather than intention-to-treat analysis, where everyone who starts the trial is counted); changing the main outcome of the trial once it has finished; producing subgroup analyses that show apparently positive outcomes for certain tightly defined groups (such as Chinese men between the ages of 56 and 71), thereby hiding an overall negative outcome; and conducting \\"seeding trials,\\" where the objective is to persuade physicians to use the drug.Bad Pharma, 194–198, 200–212. Another criticism is that outcomes are presented in terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will have a heart attack within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.Bad Pharma, 216–217. =Chapter 5: \\"Bigger, Simpler Trials\\"= In chapter five Goldacre suggests using the General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials to determine the most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind – patients would know which statin they had been prescribed – but Goldacre writes that they would be unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable to the extent that it could affect their health.Bad Pharma, 225–227, 233. =Chapter 6: \\"Marketing\\"= In the final chapter, Goldacre looks at how doctors are persuaded to prescribe \\"me-too drugs,\\" brand-name drugs that are no more effective than significantly cheaper off-patent ones. He cites as examples the statins atorvastatin (Lipitor, made by Pfizer) and simvastatin (Zocor), which he writes seem to be equally effective, or at least there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Simvastatin came off patent several years ago, yet there are still three million prescriptions a year in the UK for atorvastatin, costing the National Health Service (NHS) an annual £165 million extra.Bad Pharma, 243. He addresses the issue of medicalization of certain conditions (or, as he argues, of personhood), whereby pharmaceutical companies \\"widen the boundaries of diagnosis\\" before offering solutions. Female sexual dysfunction was highlighted in 1999 by a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which alleged that 43 percent of women were suffering from it. After the article appeared, the New York Times wrote that two of its three authors had worked as consultants for Pfizer, which at the time was preparing to launch UK-414,495, known as female Viagra. The journal's editor said that the failure to disclose the relationship with Pfizer was the journal's mistake.Bad Pharma, 261–262. For the 1999 study, Denise Grady, \\"Sure, We've Got a Pill for That\\", The New York Times, 14 February 1999. The chapter also examines celebrity endorsement of certain drugs, the extent to which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced, and whether direct-to-consumer advertising (currently permitted in the US and New Zealand) ought to be allowed.Bad Pharma, 247, 251, 271. It discusses how PR firms promote stories from patients who complain in the media that certain drugs are not made available by the funder, which in the UK is the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Two breast- cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for trastuzumab (Herceptin) to be available on the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche, the drug's manufacturer. The historian Lisa Jardine, who was suffering from breast cancer, told the Guardian that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company.Bad Pharma, 254; Sarah Boseley, \\"The selling of a wonder drug\\", The Guardian, 29 March 2006. The chapter also covers the influence of drug reps, how ghostwriters are employed by the drug companies to write papers for academics to publish, how independent the academic journals really are, how the drug companies finance doctors' continuing education, and how patients' groups are often funded by industry.Bad Pharma, 274, 287, 303, 311. =Afterword: \\"Better Data\\"= In the afterword and throughout the book, Goldacre makes suggestions for action by doctors, medical students, patients, patient groups and the industry. He advises doctors, nurses and managers to stop seeing drug reps, to ban them from clinics, hospitals and medical schools, to declare online and in waiting rooms all gifts and hospitality received from the industry, and to remove all drug company promotional material from offices and waiting rooms. (He praises the website of the American Medical Student Association – www.amsascorecard.org – which ranks institutions according to their conflict-of-interest policies, writing that it makes him \\"feel weepy.\\") He also suggests that regulations be introduced to prevent pharmacists from sharing doctors' prescribing records with drug reps.Bad Pharma, 284–286, 339–340; AMSA Scorecard, American Medical Students Association. He asks academics to lobby their universities and academic societies to forbid academics from being involved in ghostwriting, and to lobby for \\"film credit\\" contributions at the end of every academic paper, listing everyone involved, including who initiated the idea of publishing the paper.Bad Pharma, 302. He also asks for full disclosure of all past clinical trial results, and a list of academic papers that were, as he puts it, \\"rigged\\" by industry, so that they can be retracted or annotated.Bad Pharma, 350–351. He asks drug company employees to become whistleblowers, either by writing an anonymous blog, or by contacting him.Bad Pharma, 363–364. He advises patients to ask their doctors whether they accept drug-company hospitality or sponsorship, and if so to post details in their waiting rooms, and to make clear whether it is acceptable to the patient for the doctor to discuss his or her medical history with drug reps. Patients who are invited to take part in a trial are advised to ask, among other things, for a written guarantee that the trial has been publicly registered, and that the main outcome of the trial will be published within a year of its completion. He advises patient groups to write to drug companies with the following: \\"We are living with this disease; is there anything at all that you're withholding? If so, tell us today.\\"Bad Pharma, 357–358. Reception The book was generally well received. The Economist described it as \\"slightly technical, eminently readable, consistently shocking, occasionally hectoring and unapologetically polemical\\".\\"Pick your pill out of a hat\\", The Economist, 29 September 2012. Helen Lewis in the New Statesman called it an important book,Helen Lewis, \\"Lies, damn lies and drug trials\\", New Statesman, 4 October 2012. while Luisa Dillner, writing in the Guardian, described it as a \\"thorough piece of investigative medical journalism\\". Andrew Jack wrote in the Financial Times that Goldacre is \\"at his best in methodically dissecting poor clinical trials. ... He is less strong in explaining the complex background reality, such as the general constraints and individual slips of regulators and pharma companies' employees.\\" Jack also argued that the book failed to reflect how many lives have been improved by the current system, for example with new treatments for HIV, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.Andrew Jack, \\"Extremes of drug development dissected\\", Financial Times, 26 September 2012. Max Pemberton, a psychiatrist, wrote in the Daily Telegraph that \\"this is a book to make you enraged ... because it's about how big business puts profits over patient welfare, allows people to die because they don't want to disclose damning research evidence, and the tricks they play to make sure doctors do not have all the evidence when it comes to appraising whether a drug really works or not.\\"Max Pemberton, \\"Bad Pharma by Ben Goldacre: review\\", The Daily Telegraph, 22 October 2012. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) replied in the New Statesman that Goldacre was \\"stuck in a bygone era where pharmaceutical companies wine and dine doctors in exchange for signing on the dotted line\\".\\"Dr Ben Goldacre vs the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry\\", New Statesman, 19 October 2012. The ABPI issued a press release, writing that the pharmaceutical industry is responsible for the discovery of 90 percent of all medicines, and that it takes an average of 10–12 years and £1.1bn to introduce a medicine to the market, with just one in 5,000 new compounds receiving regulatory approval. This makes research and development an expensive and risky business. They wrote that the industry is one of the most heavily regulated in the world, and is committed to ensuring full transparency in the research and development of new medicines. They also maintained that the examples Goldacre offered were \\"long documented and historical, and the companies concerned have long addressed these issues\\". Goldacre argues in the book that \\"the most dangerous tactic of all is the industry's enduring claim that these problems are all in the past\\".Bad Pharma, 343. Humphrey Rang of the British Pharmacological Society wrote that Goldacre had chosen his target well and had produced some shocking examples of secrecy and dishonesty, particularly the nondisclosure of data on the antidepressant reboxetine (chapter one), in which only one trial out of seven was published (the published study showed positive results, while the unpublished trials suggested otherwise). He argued that Goldacre had gone \\"over the top\\" in devoting a whole chapter (chapter five) to recommending large clinical trials using electronic patient data from general practitioners, without fully pointing out how problematic these can be; such trials raise issues, for example, about informed consent and regulatory oversight. Rang also criticized Goldacre's style, describing the book as too long, repetitive, hyperbolic, and in places too conversational. He particularly objected to the line, \\"medicine is broken\\", calling it a \\"foolish remark\\".Humphrey Rang, \\"Book review: Bad Pharma\\", British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 75(5), 17 October 2012, 1377–1379. AllTrials Following the book's publication, Goldacre co-founded AllTrials with David Tovey, editor-in- chief of the Cochrane Library, together with the British Medical Journal, the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine, and others in the UK, and Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine and the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in the US. Set up in January 2013, the group campaigns for all past and current clinical trials to be registered and reported, for all treatments in use. The British House of Commons Public Accounts Committee produced a report in January 2014, after hearing evidence from Goldacre, Fiona Godlee, editor-in-chief of the British Medical Journal, and others, about the stockpiling of Tamiflu and the withholding of data about the drug by its manufacturer, Roche. The committee said it was \\"surprised and concerned\\" to learn that information from clinical trials is routinely withheld from doctors, and recommended that the Department of Health take steps to ensure that all clinical-trial data be made available for currently prescribed treatments.\\"Access to clinical trial information and the stockpiling of Tamiflu\\", Public Accounts Committee, 3 January 2014.

A prototype four- wheel car never entered production. Approximately 150 cars were producedUniversity of Wolverhampton. Wolverhampton History and Heritage - Museum of transport, cars. - Thompson Brothers of which only one example is believed to have survived. History Thompson Brothers was founded in 1810 in Bilston in the Black Country region of South Staffordshire (now the West Midlands), and in 1882 it was purchased by Enoch Stephen Thompson.The Times, 29 November 1937 The company was based at the Bradley Engineering Works, on Great Bridge Road, Bilston. Initially they manufactured steam boilers, but during World War I they diversified into aircraft components. After the war the tax regulations lead to a boom in cyclecar production so the aircraft department produced a three-wheeled, open, two seater, cycle car that followed aircraft engineering practises and workmanship standards, using high grade materials.Graces Guide, British Industrial History, Thompson Brothers (Bilston) The main appeal of cycle-cars was cheapness to buy and run, but in the overpopulated car market of the 1920s the cost of four-wheeled cars fell to that of cycle-cars, the business tailed off, component acquisition was troublesome, and T.B. only sold 150 cars. Although they designed a four- wheeled car it was never produced. After the demise of the cyclecar business Thompson became a leading manufacturer of commercial vehicles such as fuel tankers and airport fire tenders. thumb In 1935, an unusual three-wheeled aircraft refueller was successfully introduced for servicing light aeroplanes at civil aerodromes and during World War II many later variants were manufactured for military use. Many continued in use at civil aerodromes and airports in Britain until the 1960s and 1970s with a few still in use (e.g. at North Weald and Leicester East) in the 1990s. At least 20 examples are known to survive worldwide with museums and private owners today. Eventually the company became part of the Northern Engineering Industries Group. Models The first model produced was the 1920 cyclecar equipped with a 10 hp. air- cooled engine mated to a leather clutch and two-speed gearbox. Design and development had taken approximately 12 months and a prototype completed a 2,000 mile test. The shapely \\"radiator\\" was a combined three-gallon petrol tank and three-quart oil tank. By 1921 they used a 10 hp JAP water-cooled engine and a floating plate clutch to drive the three-speed gearbox. By 1924 the sports model was equipped with a 10 hp water-cooled Anzani engine and an aluminium body. University of Wolverhampton.

The leading Polish dailies repeated this claim without checking what is actually written in the book.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,2062655.html Within days, Józef Musielok (pl), Rector of Opole University, publicly announced his wish to punish the author of the Glossary, who then worked at the University.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,2067889.html The University’s Faculty of Philology, headed by Dean Stanisław Kochman (pl) condemned Tomasz Kamusella and his glossary, without informing him about the matter, or letting him present his own opinion on the issue.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,2067889.html Censorship in the National Library of Poland The Opole Province President, Grzegorz Kubat (pl), accused the Glossary’s author of a crime unknown to the Polish law, namely, of ‘breaching Poland’s raison d'état.’ Hence, the accusation was dismissed as unfounded.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,2498609.html Meanwhile, the regional authority secretly, in an extrajudicial manner and thus illegally, ordered the National Library of Poland (Biblioteka Narodowa) not to lend its two copies of the Glossary. This library complied readily, providing no legal basis for its decision.http://www.nto.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120115/REGION/853367746/ The information on the Glossary from the electronic catalog of the National Library of Poland reads ‘The copy of the book is not made available to readers, due to objections raised by the Regional Authority of the Province of Opole.’ The library made its two copies of the Glossary accessible to readers only in early 2012, after the regionally authority, withdrew this extrajudicial ban, claiming that the library had never been bound by the authority's 'advice' on the Glossary.http://www.nto.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120118/POWIAT01/688188352 Furthermore, the library admitted that it was the first time in its history that a book in its holdings was made inaccessible to readers.

Based on a story by Connie Lee, the film is about a singing cowboy who comes to the aid of plantation owners who are being robbed of their land by a scheming lumber company.Magers 2007, p. 168. Plot While riding the rodeo circuit, singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) meet Southerners Caroline Stanhope (June Storey) and her grandfather (Eddy Waller). The Stanhopes are hoping to win prize money in order to pay back taxes on their plantation. Their hopes are shattered when Caroline's horse Valdena is injured in an accident and unable to compete in the rodeo. With no hope of winning the prize money, Stanhope gets involved in a card game and loses $1,000 to some gamblers. With no money, he offers to give them Valdena, his only asset, but the gamblers refuse. After the rodeo, Gene gives the old man his winnings for Valdena so he can settle his debt with the gamblers. Caroline is suspicious of Gene's generosity and thinks he is trying to cheat her grandfather. Later, after her grandfather gets drunk, Caroline packs him and the horse into their car and drives back home. When Gene discovers that they've gone, he follows them, intending to protect his investment. When he arrives at the Stanhope plantation, he learns that the Stanhopes and their neighbors are in danger of losing their land for delinquent back taxes. The plantation owners are unaware that a new timber process has been developed that will turn their property into valuable timber land. Lumber company representative Barrett (Robert Fiske) is scheming to cheat the plantation owners out of their land. He's elicited the help of Henry Wheeler (Hardie Albright), the only prosperous plantation owner in the county. In an effort to help the plantation owners pay their back taxes, Gene enters Valdena in a steeplejack race. After Wheeler deliberately fouls the horse during the race, Gene becomes suspicious of his motives, eventually learning the truth. Gene convinces the plantation owners to harvest and sell the lumber themselves, but Wheeler and Barrett thwart their efforts by holding up the lumberjacks so they cannot meet the terms of their contracts. Undaunted, Gene sends for his cowboy friends, who arrive and do the lumberjacking themselves, saving the plantations.

Biography He was born in the mid-12th century and the date of his death is unknown. From his own writings it is clear that he became a deacon and magister in the Patriarchal School of Constantinople. A little before 1204 he was promoted to the metropolitan bishopric of Cyzicus, which he had to relinquish shortly after the Latin conquest. Although most of what is known about Stilbes comes from his own works, Niketas Choniates does praise a certain \\"Stilbes, a good man in every regard\\" ().Niketas Choniates Epistula 10, 215,2.  Works  Stilbes' works pertain mostly to theology, the best known among scholars is his Errors of the Latin Church, which Stilbes compiled in the wake of the Fourth Crusade. The list describes western \\"errors,\\" including their failure to honour foreign saints and their hatred of the Emperor Constantine for creating New Rome. Stilbes is also known for his poem describing a catastrophic fire that took place in Constantinople on July 25, 1197. Running to about a thousand lines, the Carmen de Incendio describes the course of the fire along the Golden Horn from the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kapısı) through the Latin Quarter, using ekphrases rich with Biblical and Classical metaphors.

Throughout its time it had several seats – namely, Klis, Solin, Knin, Bijaći and Nin. It comprised the littoral – the coastal part of today's Croatia –, except Istria, and included a large part of the mountainous hinterland, as well. The duchy was in the center of competition between the Carolingian Empire and the Byzantine Empire for rule over the area. Rivalry with Venice emerged in the first decades of the 9th century and was to continue for the following centuries. Croatia also waged battles with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom the relations improved greatly afterwards, and the Arabs and sought to extend its control over important coastal cities under the rule of Byzantium. Croatia experienced periods of vassalage to the Franks or Byzantines and de facto independence until 879, when Duke Branimir was recognized as an independent ruler by Pope John VIII. The duchy was ruled by the Trpimirović and Domagojević dynasties. Around 925, during the rule of Tomislav, Croatia became a kingdom. Nomenclature \\"Dalmatian Croatia\\" (Dalmatinska Hrvatska) and \\"Littoral Croatia\\" (Primorska Hrvatska) are modern appellations amongst historians for the Duchy.Goldstein, 1985, pp. 241-242 The state is sometimes called a principality, i.e. the \\"Principality of Croatia\\". The first recorded name for the Duchy was \\"Land of the Croats\\" () in 852.Ferdo Šišić: Povijest Hrvata u vrijeme narodnih vladara, p. 651 Croatia was not yet a kingdom at the time and the term regnum is used in terms of a country in general.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 198 In Byzantine sources the entity was usually called just \\"Croatia\\" ().Ferdo Šišić: Pregled povijesti hrvatskoga naroda 600. - 1526. - prvi dio, p. 156 The first known duke, Borna, was named \\"Duke of Dalmatia\\" ()Annales regni Francorum DCCCXVIIII (year 819) and later \\"Duke of Dalmatia and Liburnia\\" ()Annales regni Francorum DCCCXXI (year 821) in the Annales regni Francorum. The Croatian name is recorded in contemporary charters of Croatian dukes from the second half of the 9th century. Trpimir I was named \\"Duke of the Croats\\" () in a Latin charter issued in 852,Codex Diplomaticus Regni Croatiæ, Dalamatiæ et Slavoniæ, Vol I, p. 4-8 while Branimir was defined as \\"Duke of the Croats\\" () on a preserved inscription from Šopot near Benkovac.Florin Curta: Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250, p. 139-140 Geography Within the area of the Roman province of Dalmatia, various tribal groupings, which were called sclaviniae by the Byzantines, were settled along the Adriatic coast. Croatia in the early Middle Ages was an area bounded by the Eastern Adriatic hinterland on one side, then extended to a part of western Herzegovina, western and central Bosnia, then into Lika, Gacka and Krbava, and North-West to Vinodol and Labin in the Croatian Littoral area.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 31 Several coastal Dalmatian cities were under the rule of the Byzantines, including Split, Zadar, Kotor and Dubrovnik, as well as islands of Hvar and Krk.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 148 To the south Croatia bordered with the land of the Narentines, which stretched from the rivers Cetina to Neretva, and had the islands of Brač, Hvar, Korčula, Mljet, Vis and Lastovo in its possession.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 153 In the southern part of Dalmatia, there was Zahumlje (Zachumlia), Travunia and Dioclea (today Montenegro). North of Croatia there was the Duchy of Pannonia. Croatia, as well as other early medieval states, didn't have a permanent capital and Croatian dukes resided in various places on their courts. The first important center of Croatia was Klis near Split, where Duke Trpimir I resided. Other dukes ruled from the towns of Solin, Knin, Biaći and Nin.Ferdo Šišić, Povijest Hrvata; pregled povijesti hrvatskog naroda 600. - 1918., p. 159-160 Zagreb Neven Budak - Prva stoljeća Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., page 20 History =Background= Today's Fortress of Klis Delegation of Croats and Serbs to Basil I, in the Madrid Skylitzes. Most of Dalmatia in the 7th century was under the Avar Khaganate, a nomadic confederacy led by the Avars who subjugated surrounding Slavic tribes.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 251 In 614 the Avars and Slavs sacked and destroyed the capital of the province of Dalmatia, Salona, and retained direct control of the region for a few decades until they were driven out by the Croats.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 34-35 The earliest recorded Croatian leader, referred to by the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, was Porga. After their participation in Samo and Kubrat 's 632 defeat of the Avars, White Croats were either invited into Dalmatia by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (r. 610-641) and allowed to settle there, or prevailing the Avars after that lengthy war the Croats migrated across the Sava from Pannonia Savia and settled Dalmatia on their own.De Administrando Imperio, XXX. Story of the province of Dalmatia In either case, a new wave of Avars retook Pannonia in 677 but only as far as the Sava and Danube. By the early 9th century, Croatia emerged as a political entity with a duke as head of the state, territorially in the basins of the rivers Cetina, Krka and Zrmanja. It was administered in 11 counties (županija). According to De Administrando Imperio, the Croats in Pannonia were subject to the Franks for several years, as they had formerly been in their own country, until they rebelled and defeated the Franks after a seven-year war, but it is not known on which specific war and time span this refers to. Although the Christianization of Croats began right after their arrival to Dalmatia, in the early 9th century a part of the Croats were still pagan.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 235 =Frankish vassalage= The Franks gained control of Pannonia and Dalmatia in the 790s and the first decade of the ninth century.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 51 In 788 Charlemagne, after conquering Lombardy, turned further east and subjugated Istria. In the 790s Duke Vojnomir of Pannonia accepted the Frankish overlordship, whose land the Franks placed under the March of Friuli and tried to extend their rule over the Croatians of Dalmatia. In 799 the Franks under the leadership of Eric of Friuli were defeated in the Battle of Trsat in Liburnia. However, from 803 Frankish rule was recognized in most of northern Dalmatia.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 251-255 The Franks also waged wars with the Byzantine Empire until a peace treaty, known as the Pax Nicephori, was signed in 812. By that treaty the Byzantines retained control of the coastal cities and islands in Dalmatia, while acknowledging Frankish rule over Istria and the Dalmatian hinterland.Florin Curta: Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250, p. 135 From c. 810 Borna, who resided in Nin, ruled most of northern Dalmatia and was a vassal of the Carolingian Empire. Borna was Duke of the Guduscani, a Croatian tribe that lived along the river Guduča near Bribir in northern Dalmatia, later the center of the Croatian state. His rule was marked by the rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski against the Franks, who defeated Borna in 819 somewhere near the River Kupa and began to ravage Dalmatia, but harsh conditions and constant attacks from Borna's men forced Ljudevit to retreat. In 821 Borna died and was succeeded by his nephew Vladislav. =Between East and West= Carolingian times The Church of the Holy Cross in Nin from the 9th century Branimir inscription, a Latin language reference to Duke Branimir The Duchy of Croatia was located between two major powers of the Middle Ages: the Eastern Roman Empire in the East which controlled the Dalmatian cities and islands and aimed to extend their rule over the entire former Roman province of Dalmatia, and the Franks in the West seeking to control the northern and northwestern lands.Neven Budak - Prva stoljeća Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., page 51 The Byzantine influence on Croatia was also reflected on the creation of Croatian law and in trade with the Byzantine coastal cities.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 212 In the second quarter of the 9th century the Croats began developing a navy. Along with the Narentines, who were still pagan at the time and occupied the territory of the river Neretva mouth, they were active in the Adriatic Sea and made shipping and traveling in the area hazardous, especially for Venice.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 256 Therefore, in 839 the Venetians under Doge Pietro Tradonico attacked the eastern coast of the Adriatic, including Croatia, but during the assault they signed peace with their ruler, princeps Mislav (), who ruled from Klis near Split. The peace treaty was signed at a place named St. Martin. The Doge also attacked Narentine islands, but failed to defeat them and made peace with their leader, who is mentioned as count Drosaico by the chronicler John the Deacon. However, the peace treaty was short-lasting and next year the Venetians were defeated by the Narentines under count Diuditum.Iohannes Diaconus, Istoria Veneticorum, p. 124 \\"Sclaveniam bellicosis navibus expugnaturum adivit. Sed ubi ad locum qui vocatur sancti Martini curtis perveniret, pacem cum illorum principe Muisclavo nomine firmavit. Deinde pertransiens ad Narrantanas insulas cum Drosaico, Marianorum iudice, similiter fedus instituit, licet minime valeret et sic postmodum ad Veneciam reversus est. Ubi diu commorari eum minime licuit. Sed denuo preparavit exercitum adversum Diuditum Sclavum ubi plus quam centum Veneticis interfecti fuerunt et absque triumpho reversus est.\\" Piracy continued in the Adriatic, as well as hostility towards Venice, which is seen from the contract between Emperor Lothair I and Doge Tradonico, in which the Doge committed himself to defend the cities in Italy and Istria from Slavic attacks.Neven Budak - Prva stoljeća Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., page 12 Duke Mislav was succeeded around 845 by Trpimir I, who continued the formal legacy of being the vassal of the Frankish king Lothair I (840–855), although he managed to strengthen his personal rule in Croatia. Arab campaigns thoroughly weakened the Byzantine Empire and Venice, which was used in the advance of the Croatian duke in 846 and 848. In 846 Trpimir successfully attacked the Byzantine coastal cities and their patricius. Between 854 and 860, he successfully defended his land from the Bulgarian invasion under Knyaz Boris I of Bulgaria, somewhere in Northeastern Bosnia, concluding a peace treaty with Boris and exchanging gifts. Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions the traditional friendship between the Bulgarians and Croatians, who coexisted peacefully up to that time.De Administrando Imperio, XXXI. Of the Croats and of the country they now dwell inNada Klaić, Povijest Hrvata u ranom srednjem vijeku, Zagreb 1975., p. 227-231John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 52 In a Latin charter preserved in a rewrite from 1568, dated to 4 March 852 or, according to a newer research, about 840,Margetić, Lujo, Prikazi i diskusije, Split, 2002, p. 508-509 Trpimir refers to himself as \\"leader of the Croats with the help of God\\" (); his land, called \\"Kingdom of the Croats\\" (), can simply be interpreted as the \\"Realm of the Croats\\", since Trpimir was not a king. The term regnum was also used by other dukes of that time as a sign of their independence.Rudolf Horvat: Povijest Hrvatske I. (od najstarijeg doba do g. 1657.), 17. Mislav i Trpimir This charter also documents his ownership of the Klis Fortress, from where his rule was centered, and mentions Mislav's donations to the Archbishopric of Split. In the proximity of his court in Klis, in Rižinice, Trpimir built a church and the first Benedictine monastery in Croatia. Trpimir's name is inscribed on a stone fragment from an altar screen of the Rižinice monastery church. He is more expressly remembered as the founder of the House of Trpimirović, a native Croat dynasty that ruled, with interruptions, from 845 until 1091 in Croatia.Ivo Perić: A history of the Croats, 1998, p. 25 In 864 Duke Domagoj, founder of the House of Domagojević, usurped the throne after the death of Trpimir and forced his sons, including Zdeslav, to flee to Constantinople. During the rule of Domagoj piracy was a common practice in the Adriatic. The pirates attacked Christian sailors, including a ship with papal legates returning from the Eighth Catholic Ecumenical Council,Liber pontificalis 108, LIX—LX (184 f.): „... \\"post dies aliquot navigantes (legati Romani), in Sclavorum deducti Domagoi manus pro dolor! inciderunt; bonis omnibus ac authentico, in quo subscriptiones omnium fuerant, denudati sunt ipsique capite plecterentur, nisi ab his, qui ex illis aufugerant, timeretur.\\" thus forcing the Pope to intervene by asking Domagoj to stop piracy, but his efforts were of no avail. Domagoj waged wars with the Arabs, Venetians and Franks. In 871 he helped the Franks, as their vassal, to seize Bari from the Arabs, but later actions of the Franks under the rule of Carloman of Bavaria led to a revolt by Domagoj against the Frankish rule. The revolt succeeded and Frankish overlordship in Dalmatia ended, but was to continue a little longer over Pannonian Croatia.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 261 Domagoj's rule also saw increased Byzantine influence in the area, especially reflected in the establishment of Theme of Dalmatia. After the death of Domagoj in 876 Zdeslav, who had close ties to Byzantium, returned from exile, usurped the throne from an unnamed son of Domagoj and restored peace with Venice in 878.Iohannes Diaconus, Istoria Veneticorum, p. 140 \\"His diebus Sedesclavus, Tibimiri ex progenie, imperiali fultus presidio Constantinopolim veniens, Scavorum ducatum arripuit filiosque Domogor exilio trusit.\\" =Independent realm= Muncimir's charter from 892. (transcript): divino munere Croatorum dux (\\"with God's help, Duke of the Croats\\"). Balkans in the late 9th century Duke Zdeslav's reign was short and ended in 879 when Branimir of the House of Domagojević killed him and usurped the throne.Iohannes Diaconus, Istoria Veneticorum, p. 142 \\"His diebus quidam Sclavus, nomine Brenamir, interfecto Sedescavo, ipsius ducatum usurpavit.\\" Branimir was unlike Zdeslav a proponent of Rome and returned the country to the Roman fold. He had regular contacts with Pope John VIII, to whom he sent a letter revealing his intentions to entrust his people and his country to the Apostolic See. The Pope replied to his requests, praising his initiative and in 879 the Duchy under Branimir, now free of Frankish suzerainty, received papal recognition as a state.Maddalena Betti: The Making of Christian Moravia (858-882), 2013, p. 130 The second half of the 9th century marked a significant increase in papal influence in the Southeastern Europe. Pope John VIII complained to Domagoj about the obstinacy of Patriarch Ignatius who denied his jurisdiction over Bulgaria and appointed a new Archbishop. The Pope also requested from Dukes Zdeslav and Branimir assistance and protection for his legates who were crossing Croatia on their way to Bulgaria. Although the exact geographical extent of the Duchy is not known, these requests confirm geographical contiguity between Croatia and Bulgaria, which bordered probably somewhere in Bosnia. Muncimir (also called Mutimir), the youngest son of Trpimir, came to throne after the death of Branimir (c. 892), which marked the return of the House of Trpimirović to power. A Latin charter from Biaći near Trogir dated to 28 September 892 named Muncimir \\"Duke of the Croats\\" ().Codex Diplomaticus Regni Croatiæ, Dalamatiæ et Slavoniæ, Vol I, p. 23 During his rule, in the late 9th century the Hungarians crossed the Carpathians and entered the Carpathian Basin.Gyula Kristó, Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History - 9-14th centuries They invaded northern Italy and also defeated Duke Braslav from the Duchy of Pannonia, endangering Croatia.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 262 Muncimir ruled until about 910 when he was succeeded by Tomislav, the last duke and the first king of Croatia. Venetian chronicler John the Deacon wrote that in 912 a Venetian ambassador, returning from Bulgaria, passed through Croatian territory before reaching the land of Zahumlje,Iohannes Diaconus, Istoria Veneticorum, p. 150 \\"Qui dum Chroatorum fines rediens transire vellet, a Michahele Sclavorum duce fraude deceptus, omnibusque bonis privatus atque Vulgarico regi, Simeoni nomine, exilii pena transmissus est.\\" which suggests that Croatia at the time also bordered Bulgaria, then under the rule of Simeon I.Fine (Jr), John V. A. (2006). When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans, p. 63 In Historia Salonitana, a chronicle from the 13th century written by Thomas the Archdeacon from Split, Tomislav was mentioned as Duke of Croatia in 914.Thomas (Spalatensis, Archdeacon): Historia Salonitanorum Atque Spalatinorum Pontificum, p.61 According to De Administrando Imperio, Croatia at the time had 100,000 infantrymen and 60,000 horsemen, 80 large ships and 100 smaller vessels, but these numbers are viewed as a clear exaggeration and an overemphasis of the Croatian forces. Croatia also waged battles with the Magyars during the early 10th century. According to the palaeographic analysis of the original manuscript of De Administrando Imperio, assumed number of inhabitants in medieval Croatia estimated between 440,000 and 880,000 people, and military numbers of Franks and Byzantines, the military force was most probably composed of 20,000-100,000 infantrymen, and 3,000-24,000 horsemen organized in 60 allagions. During the war between the Byzantium and Bulgaria of Simeon I, in about 923, the Byzantines concluded an alliance with Croatia. Prior to that the Bulgarians had several decisive victories against the Byzantines, capturing Adrianople and endangering Constantinople. In 924 Simeon I deposed Zaharija from rule in Serbia, who fled to Croatia. In 926, Simeon's troops invaded Croatia, but were severely defeated in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 264De Administrando Imperio, XXXII. Of the Serbs and of the country they now dwell in In 927 Pope John X sent his legates to mediate a peace treaty between Croats and Bulgarians.Florin Curta: Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250, p. 196 During these years Croatia was elevated to the status of a kingdom. It is generally said that Duke Tomislav was crowned king in 925, but this is not certain since it is not known when and where was he crowned, or was he crowned at all. However, Tomislav was the first Croatian ruler whom the Papal chancellery honoured with the title king.Neven Budak - Prva stoljeća Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., p. 22 Tomislav is mentioned as a king in two preserved documents published in the Historia Salonitana and by the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, where Tomislav's rule was specified at 13 years. In a note preceding the text of the Council conclusions in Split in 925 it is written that Tomislav is the king \\"in the province of the Croats and in the Dalmatian regions\\" (in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege). In the 12th canon of the Council conclusions in 925 the ruler of the Croats is called \\"king\\" (rex et proceres Chroatorum),Codex Diplomaticus Regni Croatiæ, Dalamatiæ et Slavoniæ, Vol I, p. 32 while in a letter sent by the Pope John X Tomislav is named \\"King of the Croats\\" (Tamisclao, regi Crouatorum).Codex Diplomaticus Regni Croatiæ, Dalamatiæ et Slavoniæ, Vol I, p. 34 Although there are no inscriptions of Tomislav to confirm the title, later inscriptions and charters confirm that his 10th century successors called themselves \\"kings\\".

S. Grimaldi or JS Grimaldi, was an English stage actor, comedian and dancer, who frequently played the role of Clown in the harlequinades that accompanied nineteenth- century pantomimes. He was the son of Joseph Grimaldi, who popularised the role of Clown in the early 1800s. The young Grimaldi began his career in 1814 playing in a version of Don Juan, and in other roles, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. Throughout his teenage years, he was a successful performer, starring in Harlequin and Fortunio; or, Shing-Moo and Thun-Ton (1815), The Fates; or, Harlequin's Holy Day (1818), and Harlequin and Friar Bacon (1820), but he grew to resent the often unfavourable comparisons made between him and his famous father. Grimaldi turned increasingly to alcohol over the years, becoming unreliable, abusive and ultimately unemployable. He was mostly unemployed throughout his 20s, making his final appearance in a revival of Don Juan in 1832. He died later that year, at the age of 30. Biography =Early life and career= Grimaldi was born in Clerkenwell, London, to the actor Joseph Grimaldi and his dancer wife Mary Bristow.McConnell Stott, p. 122 Grimaldi's father popularised the role of Clown in the harlequinade of the early 1800s and invented the modern conception of whiteface clown.McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118 His father introduced Grimaldi to the eccentric atmosphere at both Drury Lane and Sadler's Wells from the age of 18 months.Findlater, pp. 123–124 Although eager to have Joseph Samuel follow him onto the stage, his father felt that it was important for the boy to have an education, and so he enrolled him at Mr Ford's Academy, a boarding-school in Putney, which taught the children of theatrical performers.Findlater, p. 20 JS excelled at school and became fluent in French. After Ford's Academy, he attended a private school in Pentonville.McConnell Stott, p. 246 Young Grimaldi made his professional debut, shortly before his 12th birthday, on 10 October 1814, as Friday in a pantomime version of Robinson Crusoe at the Sadler's Wells Theatre opposite his father, who played the title character. Although his father was initially against the idea of his young son becoming a performer, he saw the boy's promise when he starred alongside him in the piece. He became known professionally as JS Grimaldi.Neville, p. 7McConnell Stott, p. 153 Later in 1814, Grimaldi made his second professional appearance, playing the part of Scaramouche in a hugely profitable pantomime of Don Juan at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, while his father played the title role. The success of the piece confirmed, in his father's mind, that Grimaldi was more than capable of sustaining his own career.McConnell Stott, p. 247 =Adolescence= In 1814, Grimaldi's father fell ill. The seizure kept Joseph Grimaldi house bound for four months, and the theatre's receipts fell by £50 as a result. This left the 12-year-old JS to perform, for the first time, without his father by his side. The challenge resulted in an improvement in the boy's performing skills. The following year, Grimaldi and his father played together in Harlequin and Fortunio; or, Shing-Moo and Thun-Ton, the first pantomime known to have featured a principal boy. Grimaldi played Miniature Clown opposite his father, who played \\"Adult Clown\\". Joseph JS enjoyed a successful performing career throughout his teenage years. In 1818 his father took over the running of Sadler's Wells and offered Grimaldi the role of Clown in The Fates; or, Harlequin's Holy Day, opposite his parents and the comedian Jack Bologna.McConnell Stott, pp. 251–252 Grimaldi and his father also toured together.McConnell Stott, p. 245 After a few productions in 1819, Sadler's Wells Theatre was sold, and Grimaldi toured Ireland with his father in 1820.McConnell Stott, p. 253 That September, he appeared in a version of Aladdin, followed by the Christmas pantomime Harlequin and Friar Bacon in which he played Friar Bacon. Both were staged at Covent Garden theatre, with the pantomime being particularly successful.Grimaldi (Boz edition), pp. 254–255 In May 1821, Joseph Grimaldi collapsed on stage from exhaustion during a performance of Undine; or, the Spirit of the Waters. His doctors diagnosed the 42-year-old performer as suffering from \\"premature old age\\".McConnell Stott, p. 254 JS took over his father's role and completed the remainder of the show's run. Now acting as his father's official understudy, Grimaldi fulfilled many of his father's theatrical engagements, including a revival of Harlequin and Friar Bacon 1821 and Harlequin and Mother Bunch; or, the Yellow Dwarf, both in 1821.McConnell Stott, pp. 255–256 Grimaldi made a career of emulating his father's act and received favourable notices as a clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father. As his career blossomed, he was increasingly and unfavourably compared with his more famous father in terms of personality and acting ability. The comparisons affected his self-confidence.McConnell Stott, p. 274 Grimaldi's desire to distance himself professionally from his famous father had intensified during their constant touring of the provincial theatres together. Grimaldi heard of an outrage committed in 1820 by the actor Robert Bradbury, who assaulted a heckler in his audience. Bradbury gained a rebellious reputation because of it; something which appealed greatly to Grimaldi, as it was an act so far removed from his father's gentle reputation.McConnell Stott, p. 256 During the 1821 pantomime Harlequin and Mother Bunch, Grimaldi caused a scandal and was censured for threatening and verbally abusing an audience member who criticised his performance.McConnell Stott, p. 255 =Decline= J.S. Grimaldi later in his career The critical comparisons between Grimaldi and his father also adversely affected their personal relationship. By the early 1820s, Grimaldi became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. JS turned to alcohol and became increasingly unreliable; his professional engagements became rare as theatre managers were reluctant to hire him. He survived two suicide attempts: in 1821 he cut his throat, and two years later he lacerated himself on a window.McConnell Stott, p. 275 Fortunes at Sadler's Wells were also dwindling, with lessees failing to mount new engagements, thus leaving Grimaldi out of work.McConnell Stott, p. 276 His alcoholism effectively ended his career as he became abusive to colleagues and even more unreliable.McConnell Stott, p. 271 Grimaldi became estranged from his parents in 1823, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as Grimaldi went out of his way to avoid them. They communicated only through written correspondence, with Grimaldi often sending his father letters begging for money. Grimaldi stated to his father that \\"At present I am in difficulties; but as long as I earn a shilling you shall have half.\\"McConnell Stott, p. 278 Grimaldi finally returned home in 1827, when his parents were awakened one night to discover their son standing in the street, feverish, emaciated and dishevelled.McConnell Stott, p. 280 He was taken in by his parents, who managed to secure him a number of brief theatrical engagements, including a few Christmas pantomimes and benefits for his father.Findlater, 195–196McConnell Stott, pp. 294 and 309 Grimaldi's lack of a steady income eventually led to him being incarcerated in a debtors' prison.McConnell Stott, pp. 293 and 295 Upon his release on 3 March 1831, he moved in with his parents, who again tried to find him employment;McConnell Stott, p. 298 their efforts failed because he did not appear for rehearsals.McConnell Stott, p. 277 Grimaldi soon reverted to his old ways and often abused his parents' charitable nature by bringing home prostitutes and fighting with his alcoholic friends within the house.McConnell Stott, pp. 273–274 He moved out later that year.Grimaldi (Boz edition), pp. 250–251McConnell Stott, p. 303 His final performance was at the Tottenham Street Theatre in a production of Don Juan, in 1832, playing the part of Scaramouche.McConnell Stott, p. 301 =Death= Grimaldi died at age 30 on 11 December 1832 in TottenhamMcConnell Stott, pp. 300–301 and was interred at Whitefield's Tabernacle. The cause of his death remains a mystery and was treated with some suspicion. Although he had been an alcoholic and had suffered from epilepsy and bouts of mental illness for many years, there were suspicions that he had been poisonedUglow, Jenny. \\"The Pantomime Life of Joseph Grimaldi by Andrew McConnell Stott\\", The Observer (online edition), 1 November 2009, accessed 10 August 2012 or had died as a result of injuries sustained in a drunken brawl.

Anderson, photographed by J. Hubert Newman from the collection at the State Library of New South Wales Henry Charles Lennox (H.C.L.) Anderson (10 May 1853 – 17 March 1924) was instrumental in the establishment of the Mitchell Library (now The State Library of New South Wales) and held the position of Principal Librarian of the New South Wales Free Public Library as it was then known, from 1893 - 1906. The Australian Library and Information Association’s H.C.L. Anderson award, named in his memory, is given for outstanding service to the Library profession.  Early life and education  Henry Charles Lennox Anderson was born at sea on the Empire on May 10, 1853. His father, Robert Anderson, later became a police inspector, and his mother was Margaret, née Hewson. H.C.L. Anderson attended Sydney Grammar School before attaining a scholarship to attend the University of Sydney.King, C. J., 'Anderson, Henry Charles Lennox (1853–1924)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University.  Agricultural career  Anderson was appointed New South Wales's first Director of Agriculture in February 1890, a department that was established as a branch of the Department of Mines. In 1891, he established the Hawkesbury Agricultural College and the following year, established the Wagga Wagga Experiment Farm.  Contribution to the library industry  Anderson did not seek a career in libraries, he found himself in the role of Principal Librarian when in 1893 his Agriculture department was closed down and on September 1, 1893 he was appointed Principal Librarian of the Free Public Library at a reduced salary, a position for which it is reported he had 'no desire'.Jones, David J ‘Anderson: the reluctant librarian’ Australian Library Journal, v.31:1 Feb 1982, pp 28-32 Despite an inauspicious beginning, Anderson became internationally known for developing 101 rules of cataloguing with the use of subject headings. In 1896 he published Guide to the Catalogues of the Reference Library. An active member of the Library Association of Australasia, he trained staff and was first to employ women – partly due to their willingness to accept lower salaries. Under Anderson’s leadership, the Free Public Library underwent considerable changes with revitalised services and collections developed. He became Registrar of Copyright in 1901, the same year that he introduced the Dewey Decimal Classification system to the Library. Anderson first met David Scott Mitchell in 1895 and played a major role in encouraging the collector to bequeath and finance his collections to the Library.State Library of NSW (2007) A Grand Obsession: the D.S. Mitchell story . p.10 Anderson provided space for Mitchell’s collection of 10,000 volumes by moving out of his house in 1898. It took a public inquiry and five years before planning began for the Mitchell Wing of the Free Public Library. His time as Principal Librarian was not without controversy being accused of fraud and misappropriation of library materials. A Legislative Assembly Select Committee investigated complaints that he used postal concessions, sold donations, and gave preference to some booksellers, and included ‘blue’ books in the collections. After five years of investigation, he was exonerated with recommendations made for proper housing of the Mitchell Collection. In 1905 Anderson became director of the State Intelligence Department and in 1907 Government Statistician. In 1908 he returned to the re-established Department of Agriculture – accepting the position because it paid better than the Library.

The 1873 Return is sometimes called the \\"Modern Domesday\\".Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1954, p.87 It arose from the desire of the Victorian governing landed classes, many of whom sat in the House of Lords, to counter rising public clamour (encouraged by the press) about what was considered the monopoly of land. In 1872, the Local Government Board was ordered to compile a list of landowners from ratings records. One return was prepared for England and Wales (excluding London), and separate returns were prepared for Scotland (in 1874) and Ireland (in 1876). The Return lists holdings by size (in acres, roods and poles) and estimated yearly rental of all holdings over one acre. It is laid out by county and landowner, with an identifying address for each landowner. For landowners with extensive, scattered holdings, the address may not correspond to the land's location and may be outside the county in question. The location of the land is not given. A comparison with the Domesday Book survey was made in the Return Explanatory Statement. The 1873 Return had inaccuracies (some significant), and a revised edition—The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland—was published in 1883 by John Bateman (1839–1910). Origins Until 1867 only about one-eighth of the adult male population had the right to vote, but the Second Reform Bill extended the franchise — to about one third. A consequence was that, for the first time in British history, most of the electorate were not landowners. The newly enfranchised class swiftly elected the Liberal government of William Ewart Gladstone, belligerent to landowners and Conservatives. Radical politicians like Richard Cobden, John Bright and John Stuart Mill revived the arguments of the classical economists, such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, that land value enhancement was unearned wealth that ought to be taxed. Said Mill: > Land is limited in quantity while the demand for it, in a prosperous > country, is constantly increasing. The rent, therefore, progressively rises, > not through the exertion or expenditure of the owner, to which we should not > object, but by the mere growth of wealth and population. The incomes of > landowners are rising while they are sleeping, through the general > prosperity produced by the labour and outlay of other people. Wrote University of California economist Peter H. Lindert: > The issue of unequal ownership also heated up in the 1870s. Bright used the > 1861 census to charge that there were only 30,000 land-owners, and alleged > that \\"fewer than one hundred and fifty men\\" owned \\"half the land in > England,\\" a \\"practical monopoly on land .. \\". He was wrong. The fifteenth > Earl of Derby knew it, but had no data to counter Bright: :My belief is — > though I give it only as a thing which seems to me probable, not as a thing > proved — that both very great and very small properties are becoming fewer, > and those of a middle size more numerous.... But why should we be left on > this subject to mere speculation? Is it impossible to get at the facts? Is a > Domesday Book more difficult now than in the days of the Conqueror? Thus, exaggerations and false assertions had been made by opponents of the landed classes about the concentration of land ownership by a ruling elite, and reliable, independent data was needed to refute the attacks. The question was put in the House of Lords on 19 February 1872 by Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby (1826–1893) to the Lord Privy Seal, \\"Whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to take any steps for ascertaining the number of proprietors of land and houses in the United Kingdom, with the quantity of land owned by each proprietor\\". The government was in agreement with the suggestion, and Lord Derby's question was a pre-arranged formality to begin the process. Publication Lord Halifax accepted the case for the production of a Return, it was prepared by the Local Government Board, and was presented to both Houses of Parliament. The Return covers England and Wales, except for London—nearly 15,000 parishes, whose records had about 5,000,000 assessments. Instructions were issued to relevant parish officials in September 1872, and the last return was received over two years later. The first examination of the returns disclosed nearly 250,000 discrepancies, which were resolved by correspondence and other means of inquiry. All statements and information in the Return, except for owner addresses, were derived from rating valuation lists for assessments under the Poor Law and were already held by each parish. Wealthy householders and landowners paid a tax (rates) to maintain the roads, other features and chiefly to support the poor. =Sources= Unlike the Domesday Book, the 1873 Return was not based on original research by surveyors but compiled existing parish data. The valuation lists of 1873 were prepared under the provisions of the Union Assessment Committee Act of 1862, which was introduced by Poor Law Board president Charles Pelham Villiers. The Poor Law Commissioners issued an order specifying the poor rate shortly before 1836, and the Parochial Assessment Act that contained the first statutory provision prescribing the rate. The 1862 act provided for the appointment of an assessment committee by the guardians of every union for investigating and supervising the valuation of taxable properties in each parish of a union for assessment purposes. The overseers of each parish were required to make out a list of all taxable properties and their annual value in the following format: occupant, owner, property description and name (or location, estimated area, gross estimated rental, and taxable value. Valuation lists existed for every parish in 1873, except for a few parishes under separate boards of guardians to which the Union Assessment Committee Act did not apply. Parish valuation lists were deposited with the clerks of the unions, and application was made to those officers to prepare and furnish particulars for the 1873 Return; similar applications were made to the guardians of parishes not under the Union Assessment Committee Act. Format The columns were headed from left to right: \\"Surname, Christian name, Acres, Rods, Perches, £s. Area is listed as A/R/P. A is acre (640 to the square mile). R is rood: a ploughing strip 220 yards long (one furlong) and wide (one rod, pole or perch). Four roods equal one acre. P is a square pole []; 40 square poles equal one rood. Rentals are in £ (pounds) and s (shillings); 20 shillings equal £1. The £s value relates to the land's gross estimated rental. Problems were encountered in defining the headings. England and Wales The Return was published in 1875 and sold for 10s 6d () each in two leather-bound volumes (edited by John Lambert) as England and Wales (Exclusive of the Metropolis): Return of Owners of Land, 1873; Presented to both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty; London, printed by George Edward Eyre and William Spottiswoode. Printers to the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty. For her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1875. Scotland The Scottish Return was published in 1874 as \\"Scotland: Owners of Lands and Heritages 17 & 18 Vict., Cap. 91, 1872–3 Return: I: Of the name and address of every owner of one acre and upwards in extent (outside the municipal boundaries of boroughs containing more than 20,000 inhabitants) with the estimated acreage and the annual value of the land and heritages of individual owners. And of the number of owners of less than one acre with the estimated aggregate acreage and annual value of the lands and heritage of such owners in each county II: A similar return for municipal boroughs containing more than 20,000 inhabitants. Presented to both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty; Edinburgh: Printed by Murray and Gibb, printers to Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1874\\". Ireland In 1873, the Local Government Board for Ireland began to ascertain the number and names of owners of land of one acre or more. Clerks of the Poor Law unions were ordered to draw up lists of such people from the property valuation and rate books in their custody. The lists were returned to the Local Government Board by the end of 1875, arranged into counties, alphabetised, and published in 1876 in a 200-page edition as Return of Owners of Land of One Acre and Upwards, in the Several Counties, Counties of Cities, and Counties of Towns in Ireland. Popularity Although the Return was published for a political reason, it became sought- after reading amongst society in general (including the landed classes). John Bateman, in the preface to his 1883 work (see below), summarised the situation: Corrected and derivative editions John Bateman FRGS (1839–1910) published The Acre-Ocracy of England, based on the 1873 Return, in 1876. Bateman published a corrected and edited version of the 1873 Return, which differs significantly from the original, under the Harrison imprint in 1883. He listed the commonest sources of error in its preface. The fourth (and final) edition of his work was The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, A list of all owners of Three thousand acres and upwards, worth £3,000 a year; Also, one thousand three hundred owners of Two thousand acres and upwards, in England, Scotland, Ireland, & Wales, their acreage and income from Land, Culled from \\"The Modern Domesday Book\\". It was republished in 1971 by Leicester University Press, with text from the 1883 edition and an introduction by David Spring.

Few of her works have survived, but she is notable for her 1886 painting Fantine, which hangs in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, England. The subject of the painting is Fantine, a character in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables. Biography Margaret Bernadine Hall was born in 1863 in Wavertree, Liverpool. Her father was Bernard Hall (1813–1890), a merchant, local politician and philanthropist, who was elected Mayor of Liverpool in 1879. Her mother was Margaret Calrow (1827–1902) from Preston, who was Bernard Hall's second wife. Margaret was their second child, and their oldest daughter. In 1882 the family moved to London, and later that year, at the age of 19, Margaret moved to Paris to study for five years at the academy run by Auguste Feyen-Perrin and Eduard Krug. This was at a time when there were few female artists in the city, and when the Impressionists were active. Between 1888 and 1894 Hall travelled extensively to countries including Japan, China, Australia, North America, and North Africa, returning to Paris in 1894. She moved back to England in 1907, where she died three years later at the home of the playwright George Calderon in Hampstead Heath, London. Following her death, her estate was valued at £22,130 (). She was interred in the churchyard of All Saints' Church, Childwall, Liverpool, and there is a brass memorial tablet to her in the north aisle of the church. In 1925 a retrospective exhibition of her paintings was held in Chelsea, London. Works Most of Hall's paintings have disappeared. In addition to Fantine, it is known that she painted Les Abandonées, and Le Pauvre Père, all of which were studies in social realism. In 1885 Les Abandonées was exhibited in the Paris Salon. Fantine was painted in the following year, the year after Victor Hugo died, and it received an honourable mention from the Société des Femmes Peintres. In 1887 Hall's paintings were shown at exhibitions in Vienna, Chicago, London and Manchester. What happened to most of the paintings after Hall's death is not known. In 1910, her brother Sir Douglas Hall offered Fantine and Les Abandonées to the National Gallery, London, but they were declined. During the following year he offered them to the Walker Art Gallery, and Fantine was accepted. There are two other known extant paintings by Hall. In Trinity College, Cambridge is a portrait entitled Sedley Taylor (1834–1920), Music Scholar and Benefactor, which was painted in 1898. The other painting came to light in 2011; it is in private ownership, and is a portrait of her brother, Sir Douglas Bernard Hall, with an estimated date of 1884. The only other known surviving works from the hand of Margaret Hall are five copies she made of paintings by Murillo, Raphael, Veronese, and Ribalta, commissioned by the Sisters of the Chapel of the Transfiguration in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.

A nonsectarian spiritual movement, it is based on the Japanese Gedatsu-kai, a new religious movement that was founded in 1929 by Seiken Okano. The Church preaches about Gedatsu-kai, a religious study dedicated toward promoting total inner peace and spiritual enlightenment.

Retrieved August 10, 2012. Ine Kenyu Kiyota was a student of Okano's, and was given the mission to spread Gedatsu-Kai to the United States. Kiyota brought Gedatsu-Kai to California during the late 1930s. Upon the beginning of World War II, Kiyota, along with the Japanese and Japanese-American populace in the United States, were forced into relocation camps. Kiyota refused to pledge loyalty to the United States in protest of the internment, and was sent to the Tule Lake Camp. Kiyota spent her time in Tule Lake practicing Gedatsu-Kai, and spreading the teachings of Seiken Okano. Upon being released from Tule Lake, Kiyota founded the first branch of the Gedatsu Church of America in San Francisco, California. In 1950, Bishop Takeo Kishida, the most prominent member of Gedatsu-Kai in Japan, moved to the San Francisco Branch. Later that year, Kishida purchased 20 acres of farmland in Sacramento, California, founding the Sacramento Branch, and dedicating the land as the goreichi, or spiritual grounds, for the United States. In 1952, the church purchased a church building in Los Angeles, California, and founded its third U.S. branch. In 1961, the original San Francisco Branch of the church dissolved, and the American headquarters moved to Los Angeles, and in 1981, the fourth church branch was founded in Honolulu, Hawaii.  Beliefs and practices   Branches  The three current branches of the Gedatsu Church of America are the Sacramento, Los Angeles, and Honolulu Branches. Total membership of the church is disputed, with Kishida claiming followers of Gedatsu-Kai in North America amount to roughly 2000 in the early 1980s, while those who were considered actually active was much lower, in the low hundreds.Ishii, Kenji (1983). Transformation of a Japanese New Religion In American Society: A Case Study Of Gedatsu Church Of America. pp. 167-168. In the 1980s, the San Francisco and Sacramento churches were mostly Japanese speaking, but the Los Angeles church differed, integrating English into its ceremonies and services.Ishii, Kenji (1983). Transformation of a Japanese New Religion In American Society: A Case Study Of Gedatsu Church Of America. pp. 168. In 2019, all three churches hold services in English, but only the Los Angeles branch still holds services for Japanese speakers.  Goreichi  The goreichi in Sacramento is home to several Gedatsu shrines. The list of shrines at the goreichi, and their descriptions are as follows. * Tenjinchigi  Tenjinchigi is the source of all life and unconditional love. The word comes from the Shinto God of Nature, but represents the Supreme Spirit of the Universe.  The Tenjinchigi is depicted as a wooden house, modeled after the Tenjinchigi shrine at the goreichi in Kitamoto, Japan. In front of the shrine is a Torii, a wooden arch that acts as a gateway to a sacred place. * Benzaiten  Benzaiten is the Gedatsu Water deity. At the Benzaiten shrine, water and its life sustaining properties are appreciated.  The Benzaiten shrine is located on an island in a man-made pond. The pond is often drained due to its expensive upkeep. * Fudo Myo-o  The Fudo Myo-o, or Fudo Deity, comes from Buddhism, and represents stability and peacefulness.  The Fudo Myo-o shrine is made up of a large statue of the Fudo deity. He sits upon a pedestal, watching over a fire pit in front of him. The fire pit is used during seasonal festivals for the purpose of burning ceremonial plaques. The Fudo Myo-o is depicted with one eye open and one eye closed, and holding a sword. The sword represents the act of cutting away the obstacles to enlightenment, and his eyes represent both the discipline and the compassion of the Supreme Spirit of the Universe. * Bato Kanzeon  The Bato Kanzeon originates from Buddhism, and is Gedatsu's guardian spirit of traffic safety.  The Bato Kanzeon consists of a large stone tablet upon a pedestal, with the Chinese character for \\"horse\\" carved into it. Formerly, there were small statues of horses on either side of the tablet, but they were stolen by vandals and never replaced. * Rokujizo  Rokujizo comes from Buddhism and is the guide that aids humans out of the six states of human suffering, hence \\"roku.\\" Rokujizo is a representation of the Supreme Spirit of the Universe's unconditional love.  The Rokujizo shrine is a long stone pedestal, with six statues sitting upon them. * Memorial Tower  The Memorial Tower is a building dedicated to enshrining deceased church members. Their names are enshrined inside the building, along its walls. Gedatsu Kongo is enshrined in the center. * All Souls Monument  The All Souls Monument is dedicated to the appreciation of all living things. One could express thanks to their deceased family and ancestors, or to fallen soldiers, slain Native Americans, or victims of natural disasters. Inside the main church building, there is an altar that holds the three objects of worship in Gedatsu-kai, the Tenjinchigi, Gochi Nyorai, and Gedatsu Kongo. The church grounds also has a repurposed military surplus quonset hut, known as the Social Hall, which served as the church hall until the current church building was built.
