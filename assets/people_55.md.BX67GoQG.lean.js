HistoryBeginnings= There is a lack of clarity as to whether Transnistria was part of Kievan Rus' beginning in the 11th Century, and if so, to what degree. After the disintegration of Kievan Rus' because of the Mongol Invasions, this area came under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 15th century as part of Podolia. Much of Transnistria remained a part of Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth until the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. In 1504 the Crimean Khanate conquered the southernmost portion of Transnistria south of the Iagorl√Æc/Jagorlyk river along with the rest of the Yedisan region which remained under the control of the Ottoman Empire until 1792. Thus the border between the two states was set on the Iagorl√Æc river, referred to as the Iahurl√Æc in Moldavian chronicles, Sava, p.5 and in Polish source as Jahorlik or Jahor≈Çyk[Geographical_Dictionary_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland], 1880‚Äì1902, b.III p.372 http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_III/372 =Polish Colonization= Population density per voivodeship in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1650. Today's Transnistria region was in Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship, which was significantly less densely populated than its neighboring provinces to the west because of slave raids from the Crimean Khanate. Because of the massive slave raids and invasions launched by the Crimean Khanate, much of the southern region of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was sparsely populated. To remedy this, the 16th and 17th centuries Polish kings, in particular Stephen B√°thory and Sigismund III Vasa, sponsored large-scale Polish colonization of Podolia, which includes the territories of modern Transnistria. Polish magnates were given large tracts of sparsely settled lands, while Polish petty gentry managed the estates and served as soldiers. Serfs were enticed to move into these territories by a temporary 20 year exemption from serfdom. Although most serfs were from western Ukrainian lands, a significant number of Polish serfs from central Poland also settled these estates. The latter tended to assimilate into Ukrainian society and some of them even took part in the Cossack uprisings against the landlords. Polish magnates from Ukraine played a significant political and social role within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as did the native nobility in these areas which Polonized over time. Polish rule at this time involved the expansion of Jesuit schools and large scale construction of ornate castles and estates that included libraries, art collections, and archives that in many cases were the equal in importance to those in Poland itself. By the late 18th century, approximately 11% of the population were Roman Catholics, most of them Poles. Poles in Ukraine.

At the time of the Partition of Poland, approximately ten percent of the population of all of the territories annexed by Russia were ethnically Polish.(2003). Timothy Snyder. The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press Poles included wealthy magnates with large estates, poorer nobles who worked as administrators or soldiers, and peasants. Long after this region ceased being a part of Poland, Poles continued to play an important role in both the province and in the city of Kiev. Until the failed Polish insurrection of 1830-1831, Polish continued to be the administrative language in education, government and the courts. Poles in Ukraine. Entry: Encyclopedia of Ukraine, pp. 86-94 Toronto: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Toronto Press Under the Russian Empire, Polish society tended to stratify. The Polish magnates prospered under the Russian Empire, at the expense of the serfs and of the poorer Polish nobility whom they pushed from the land. The wealthy magnates tended to oppose the Polish insurrections, identified with their Russian landlord peers, and often moved to St. Petersburg. The Polish national movement in Ukrainian lands thus tended to be led by members of the middle and poorer gentry, who formed secret societies in places with large Polish populations. Poles in Ukraine. Entry: Encyclopedia of Ukraine, pp. 86-94 Toronto: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Toronto Press As a result of an anti-Russian insurrection in 1830, the Polish middle and poorer nobility were stripped of their legal noble status by the Russian government, and Russification policies were enacted. These Polish nobles, legally reduced to the status of peasants, often assimilated into the Ukrainian language and culture. Many of the poorer Polish nobles who became Ukrainianized in language, culture and political loyalty constituted an important element of the growing Ukrainian national movement.

The area that would become Transnistria was organized into the Ukrainian SSR in 1919, under which the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created in 1924. Under Stalinist rule, the Polish community would decline further. After a brief initial period of liberalization and freedom towards Poles in the Soviet Union were subject to harassment, dispersal and mass terror. This trend increased in the late 1930s, as a result of the 1937-8 Polish Operation of the NKVD as well as the ceasing of educational instruction in the Moldavian ASSR for all non- Romanians populations in their native languages which was replaced by Ukrainian and Russian. =After World War II until the collapse of the USSR= The number of Poles in all of the regions within the former Soviet Union has been steadily decreasing over the past century. To a large extent this decline can be traced due to policies of Sovietization which aimed to destroy Polish culture in the USSR. Knowledge about the Polish community in Moldova and Transnistria was completely absent in Poland throughout the entire postward period until the collapse of the USSR. This trend was only reversed in the 1990s when Polish researchers gained the ability to conduct research in Moldova and Transnistria.\\"Narodziny czy odrodzenie?

The 2004 Census in Transnistria reported 2% of the population (about 1,100) to be Poles. Some publications of Polonia activists and Polish diplomats mention numbers of up to 20,000 of Poles, -- numbers significantly exceeding that of self-identified Poles in the census. Some authors include in their estimates people of Polish descent, while others assume people of Catholic faith (in a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country) are most probably of Polish descent; and this may include, e.g. Ukrainians with ties to Poland in their ancestry. As a consequence of the Russian and Soviet policies towards Polish culture, only a small percentage of Poles in Transnistria today speak Polish. Some Transnistrian politicians such as former First Lady Nina Shtanski and Yevgeni Zubov are open about their Polish roots.

At the event, more than 400 international guests attended, including 20 Heads of State and Government, 50 foreign and defence ministers and 90 government delegations. Joachim Gauck was the first German Federal President to ever deliver the opening speech.  Opening speech  In his speech, Gauck called for a new German foreign policy, together with a stronger foreign policy commitment from Germany, which would show a greater self-confidence and take on more responsibility. The President referred to the Federal Republic as \\"the best Germany we have ever had\\". The country should not hide behind its historic guilt. In addressing the federal government, he pleaded with it \\"not to flee from threats\\". Instead, Germany should \\"decisively and substantially stand up‚Äù in the defence of their own values. Finally, the President urged Germans to correct their own self-image. The previous six decades of the Federal Republic as a free and stable nation should justify the Germans having \\"trust and confidence\\" in themselves. Gauck called it a requirement for Germany to be \\"reliable for their partners\\" in the world. Ukrainian opposition leaders meeting John Kerry at the Munich Security Conference 2014  Euromaidan  A dominant theme of the conference was the violent clashes between government and opposition in Ukraine. At the Munich Security Conference, US Secretary of State John Kerry promised the Ukrainian opposition support from the West. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western countries of assisting the violent uprising in Ukraine which was getting out of control. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, on the other hand, accused Russia of violating Ukraine's rights to a free choice of alliances. Ukrainian politician Vitali Klitschko accused the Ukrainian government during a panel discussion of responding with acts of terror and violence to the demands of the opposition. Klitschko called for economic sanctions against those responsible for the violence. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara dismissed the allegations that his country's political policies were directed against Europe. Since Ukraine is geographically part of Europe and also carries a very close relationship with Russia, Koschara warned, it should not be faced with the decision of \\"Europe or Russia\\". The Foreign Minister also declared that Ukraine had already met key demands of the opposition. His claims that the violence in Ukraine started from terrorists was countered by Klitschko who distributed a collection of images of the protests in Ukraine to panel participants and spectators. During the conference, Catherine Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, started a mediation initiative, inviting members of the Ukrainian parties in conflict and the Foreign Ministers of important EU countries to participate. During the conference, Swiss Federal President Didier Burkhalter, in his capacity as OSCE Chairman, pointed out again an existing offer of mediation of the OSCE to the conflicting parties in Ukraine. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Leonid Kozhara, Vitali Klitschko, Leonid Slutsky, Irakli Garibashvili, Traian BƒÉsescu and ≈†tefan F√ºle participated in a panel discussion regarding the situation in Ukraine. Panel on the 50th anniversary  New security risks  The panel discussion on the history of the Security Conference to mark the 50th anniversary had attendances from former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who both had participated in the first Internationale Wehrkundebegegnung in 1963. Attendances in the discussions also included the former French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, the former German Federal Minister for Special Tasks Egon Bahr, former British Foreign Minister David Miliband and the acting Polish Foreign Minister Rados≈Çaw Sikorski. During the discussions, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing pointed out that the number of major wars has decreased while the level of violence, the risk of new threats such as terrorism or cyber-attacks and the number of refugees have increased worldwide. In combination with this, the former French President justified the military interventions of his country in Africa. Henry Kissinger also shared the assessment of an increasingly complex global security situation, which hampered the development of \\"coherent strategies\\". The former US Secretary of State cited Sino-Japanese territorial conflicts that could lead to military conflict. Kissinger pushed that Europe in turn was very \\"reluctant to military conflicts\\" and was sometimes too \\"hesitant\\" in the fight against violence, a criticism that Giscard d'Estaing already accused Europe of and linked it to \\"discouragement\\". Recalling the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq, Kissinger warned however to be cautious that the decisions of military intervention should not be influenced by a \\"moment of rage\\", if willingness is not given to such wars to \\"endure to the end\\". Egon Bahr emphasized the risks of new, hard- to-find threats such as cyber-attacks on power grids and other infrastructure facilities. These threats had even made the US vulnerable and revealed an existing inability to defend themselves against them. Bahr further demanded a policy of deterrence analogous to that of the days of the nuclear threat. Asked about the future of NATO, Bahr, Kissinger and Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing all expressed their conviction that NATO would still exist in ten years‚Äô time.  Loss of importance for Europe  Former German Chancellor Schmidt said Europe was decreasing in importance. Schmidt stated that the consequences of global population growth were crucial for the continent's future. Europe will make up only seven percent of the world population in 2050, while in 1950 more than one in five people had lived in Europe. According to Schmidt, the Europeans overestimated their global significance. The former Chancellor critically regarded global urbanization, which leads to the \\"big urban masses\\", who were \\"easily led astray\\" by the temptations of modern media. Schmidt called the \\"power of the financial manager\\" another threat which despite the recent financial crisis was unabated. The current European Union policy, Schmidt described as a future hazard: \\"If the EU continues the way that it is, in ten years‚Äô time NATO will still be there, but maybe not the EU.\\" David Miliband described a decline of classical foreign policy and attributed this to the fact that the electorate increasingly placed regional and national issues at the centre of importance.  NSA Affair  Hagel speaking at 50th MSC No approaches were made towards the transatlantic conflict over NSA surveillance in Europe. The US Secretaries John Kerry and Chuck Hagel avoided any mention of this controversial subject. Instead Kerry advocated a \\"transatlantic renaissance\\" based on common values. Hagel emphasized the role of Europe as an \\"indispensable partner\\" of the United States. Both ministers campaigned for the transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP. US Senator John McCain added in relation to the NSA spying on allies as a 'credibility problem', which the American government had to deal with in order to regain lost trust. Significant criticism of the NSA spying was voiced by German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re. Throughout the discussion he called the spying on German citizens \\"excessive\\" and demanded a \\"signal from the Americans to their closest partner in Europe\\". De Maizi√®re declared that the political damage caused by these surveillance measures was higher than their security benefits. The Federal Minister of the Interior called the information provided by the American side completely inadequate. A possible no-spy agreement with the United States provided the Minister with no great expectations. Along with Kerry and Hagel, de Maizi√®re agreed with a continuation of negotiations on TTIP. The German MEP Elmar Brok predicted a defeat in the vote on the TTIP agreement in the European Parliament in the event that an examination and reappraisal of the NSA's activities would fail. Company representatives from Deutsche Telekom, Huawei and Microsoft demanded a binding international standard of Internet security. Thus, Deutsche Telekom CEO Timothy H√∂ttges called for an international agreement of digital basic rights. Microsoft Vice President Matt Thomlinson announced the opening of the company's own transparency centres, including one in Brussels, where governments could check the source code of Microsoft products to ensure that they contain no backdoors for US intelligence agencies.  New order in former Yugoslavia  Ashton with presidents Ivica Daƒçiƒá and Hashim Tha√ßi During the conference, the two Prime Ministers from Serbia and Kosovo, Ivica Daƒçiƒá and Hashim Tha√ßi, came together and discussed the rapprochement between the two countries, which in 2013 had led to the signing of the normalization Agreement, under the moderation of Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Both leaders reaffirmed their intention to seek solutions, \\"that advance the two nations\\". Daƒçiƒá called the convergence process as a \\"tightrope walk\\" and Tha√ßi referred to resisters in the population that had to be overcome before the agreement.  Middle East  Kerry, Ban Ki-moon, Brahimi, and Lavrov before a meeting on Syria The conference also hosted a meeting of the Middle East Quartet in which EU Representative Ashton put economic aid for Israelis and Palestinians on the table if both parties consented to a peace agreement. US Secretary of State Kerry had previously referred to a failure of the Middle East negotiations as \\"unacceptable\\". After the previously unsuccessful negotiations in Geneva of the Syrian civil war parties, discussions at the security conference took no further approach towards the Syrian conflict. Despite his announcement of follow-up negotiations, designated UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi stated that the international peace efforts in Syria had failed. Brahimi warned of a further escalation of the situation in Syria. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the parties in conflict to hold \\"serious and sincere\\" future negotiations. The Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif echoed the call of his country for a ceasefire in Syria, referring to the difficulties of monitoring such actions.  Iran's nuclear programme  During a debate on Iran's nuclear program, Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted on his country's right to use nuclear energy. In connection with the forthcoming international negotiations, there were \\"many steps\\" to go, the Iranian foreign minister stated. Zarif called the previously reached agreements a significant beginning and assured the readiness of Iran to constructive negotiations. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano spoke of positive feedback from Iran, but said that a lot of work still had to be done. Amano also pointed out that the IAEA still did not have access to all nuclear facilities and could therefore \\"not exclude the character of some non-peaceful Iranian activities\\". Israeli defense minister Moshe Ya'alon warned following the debate against too much optimism and stated that Iran will continue to develop its nuclear program throughout the course of the current negotiations. The fact that Ya‚Äôalon and the Israeli Ambassador to the UN, Ron Prosor, were among the audience during the appearance of the Iranian foreign minister was interpreted as a public gesture of rapprochement to Iran. The Iranian nuclear program was also the subject of a meeting between Zarif and US Secretary of State Kerry.

Variations on the story can be seen in the British movies Calendar Girls and Made in Dagenham: women decide they have been classified by others as weak, demure, old, and decide to rebel, proving something to themselves as much as to others. And there are many sports movies about that improbable season or improbable victory - usually by a group of misfits - who triumph over adversity in a crunch game at the end of the season. Here, however, it is all very real, genuinely anchored in the Canada we know. \\"Imagine Skate Canada meets The Real Housewives\\" is CBC's description but that's just silly.

St. Petersburg, Florida: Booklocker.com. Brief History Fort Caben was built on the banks of Crescent Lake (near St. Johns Park in present-day Flagler County, Florida) by the U.S. Army during the Second Seminole War to prevent Seminole Indian raiding parties, that were traveling on boats and canoes on the St. Johns River, from attacking and looting the numerous plantations that were located south of St. Augustine. Fort Caben was most likely a blockhouse style fortification as it was located near a waterway, and the area provided a vast number of trees for building materials.Mahon, John K.

Second Seminole War (1835-1842) Fortifications in the Present-day Volusia and Flagler County Area. Halifax Herald, Volume 35, Number 2, Fall 2017. Operations Fort Caben was likely manned by U.S. Army troops on a part-time basis during the Second Seminole War for training, reconnaissance and defensive purposes. Many of these smaller and remote forts were not manned on a full-time basis as troops were regularly relocated to areas where there was Seminole Indian activity during the Second Seminole War. No known attacks or skirmishes were recorded at Fort Caben.Missall, John and Mary Lou Missall. (2004) The Seminole Wars: America's Longest Indian Conflict. University Press of Florida. Fate Fort Caben was most likely abandoned, and burned down, sometime around 1839 as no mention of it after this time is documented. Today, the site of Fort Caben is in a densely wooded and secluded area and would most likely require Lidar technology and an experienced archaeologist to locate the exact spot where it was built.

Early life  Humphreys attended St Michael's College, Dublin, graduating in 1984. He received BCL and LLM law degrees from University College Dublin in 1988 and 1989. While at UCD, Humphreys was the auditor of the L&H; society between 1986 and 1987. During his term in charge of the society, it hosted the World Universities Debating Championship. He subsequently attended the King's Inns and obtained a PhD in law from Trinity College Dublin.  Legal career  He was called to the Bar in 1991 and became a senior counsel in 2009. He practised primarily in the area of public law, specifically Constitutional law, judicial review and immigration law. He twice appeared for Sinn F√©in in constitutional challenges. He also appeared in media law and defamation cases. Humphreys was a lecturer at UCD and University College Cork between 1990 and 1993, and also taught at the law faculties of TCD and NUI Galway. He was a member of the Balance in Criminal Law Review Group and the chairperson of the Statute Law Expert Advisory Group. While a government adviser, he attended talks in 1996 which contributed to the Good Friday Agreement. He has since written two texts on the agreement, United Ireland and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Political career  As a teenager, Humphreys was a member of Young Fine Gael, before becoming a member of the Labour. He worked as a legal adviser to Labour for two decades. He became a legal adviser to Mervyn Taylor at the Department of Equality and Law Reform in January 1993, holding that position until 1997. He was elected to D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council in 2009 as a county councillor for Stillorgan, re-elected in 2014, serving until his retirement in May 2015. In 2010, he proposed a motion to offer to hold an event to welcome Elizabeth II.  Judicial career  Humphreys was appointed to the High Court in October 2015, by the Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition government. In an immigration case ruling in 2016, he followed a 2008 ruling of Judge Mary Irvine that the unborn had constitutional rights that should be considered by the Minister for Justice, and took the view that this conclusion was reinforced by Article 42A of the Constitution of Ireland. The Supreme Court of Ireland in 2018 reversed this reasoning but upheld the order that the Minister was obliged to consider the rights that would accrue on birth of the child. He has also heard numerous judicial review cases, including decisions of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Education and Skills. In 2018, he ordered the State Examinations Commission to expedite its decision on an appeal to the awarding of Leaving Certificate points. Humphreys was appointed to the Law Reform Commission as a part-time commissioner for a five- year term in October 2020. The same month, the Supreme Court gave judgment on an appeal against two 2019 judgments by Humphreys in an immigration case; while upholding his \\"lucid, reasoned, elegant and intelligent\\" judgment, Justice Marie Baker criticised \\"quite remarkable and personally insulting comments\\" he had made about counsel for both sides. ; ; ; He is the judge in charge of the Strategic Infrastructural Development Judicial Review List of the High Court.

In 2010, Marmar retired as a footballer; despite his multiple injuries throughout his career, Marmar won two league titles (2007‚Äì08 and 2009‚Äì10), three Lebanese FA Cups (2003‚Äì04, 2004‚Äì05, and 2008‚Äì09), two Lebanese Elite Cups (2008 and 2010), a Lebanese Federation Cup (2004), and two Lebanese Super Cups (2008 and 2010). Managerial career Ahed = In 2007 Marmar was appointed assistant manager of Ahed, which was coached by German manager Robert Jaspert. Describing his time as Jaspert's assistant, Marmar stated that he \\"felt like a partner\\", which was \\"what made [him] want to become a coach\\". Following his retirement as a player in 2010, Marmar went to Germany to get coaching courses. Upon his return to Lebanon, he was appointed technical director of Ahed's academy and youth sector. He won the under-15 league in 2012, the under-17 league in 2013 and 2014, and the under-17 league in 2015 and 2016. In 2014 and 2015, Marmar was Ahed's caretaker manager; he became Ahed's first team manager in 2016 following the departure of Robert Jaspert. In his first season as coach, Marmar won the 2016‚Äì17 Lebanese Premier League. Marmar was nominated 2016‚Äì17 Lebanese Premier League Coach of the Season. After winning the league, Marmar went back to coaching Ahed's youth side, citing difficulties with the players as the main reason. Three matchdays into the 2017‚Äì18 season, Marmar was re-appointed as head coach of Ahed. Marmar stated: \\"At that moment, there was a shift of mentality in the club. The players were starting to get accountable for their actions. The issues I faced when I was there started to vanish, so I took back the job.\\" That season, Marmar helped Ahed win the domestic double, lifting both the league and FA Cup titles. He was awarded Lebanese Coach of the Season for the second consecutive time. In 2018‚Äì19, Marmar helped Ahed win a second successive domestic double, lifting the league, FA Cup, and Super Cup. He went unbeaten for 46 games in a span of over two years. In 2019 Ahed beat North Korean club 25 April 1‚Äì0 in the 2019 AFC Cup Final: they became the first Lebanese football club to accomplish the feat. Ahed only conceded three goals in 11 games, going unbeaten throughout the whole tournament. For the third consecutive time, Marmar was named Lebanese Coach of the Season. As Ahed's manager Marmar has won three league titles, two FA Cups, and two Super Cups, as well as the 2019 AFC Cup. = Al-Arabi = On 25 July 2020, after being involved with Ahed for 24 years as a player and as a manager, Marmar was hired as head coach of Kuwaiti club Al-Arabi. He became the first Lebanese manager to coach outside of Lebanon at professional level. Marmar reunited with former Ahed players Ahmad Al Saleh and Issah Yakubu. In Marmar's first game he helped Al-Arabi win 4‚Äì1 against Burgan, in the quarter-finals of the 2019‚Äì20 Kuwait Crown Prince Cup. Marmar won the competition, after beating Kuwait SC 2‚Äì1 in the final on 21 September 2020.  Personal life  Marmar was born on 28 March 1977 in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, to Lebanese parents; his family is originally from Tayibe, Lebanon. Marmar is fluent in both Arabic and English. On 23 August 2020, it was announced that Marmar tested positive for COVID-19 after flying from Lebanon to Kuwait to begin his coaching stint at Al-Arabi. Marmar underwent a two-week home quarantine. On 28 August, Marmar tested negative to a swab test; he ended his home quarantine period on 2 September.

BK and his friends jumped into the stream to save themselves. Later two additional bodies were found, those of Ganesh Budha and Lokendra Sunar.  Incident  Nawaraj BK, from the Jajarkot District, went to the Soti village in Rukum District to marry a 17-year-old girl, with her consent. BK went to the village with 18 others on Saturday, 23 May 2020. Upon arriving in the village, they were allegedly attacked and chased by villagers, including Dambar Bahadur Malla, ward chair of Chaurjahari, and the girl's family. The group chased them to the Bheri River and six men jumped into the river to save themselves. According to some villagers, the group was attacked because of their caste; BK was a \\"lower caste\\" man trying to marry an \\"upper caste\\" girl. Also, the girl's family claims that BK was trying to marry the under-aged girl despite their refusal. BK had been in a relationship with the girl for three years, and wanted to marry her.

Lukban was elected to the Philippine Assembly and was mayor of the capital Manila from 1917 until 1920. Early life Justo Lukban was born in Labo, nowadays part of the Philippine province of Camarines Norte. He was the second child from a family of six children of Agustin Lukban and Andrea Rillon. One of his three brothers was General Vicente Lukban. He enrolled in 1873 at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran where he achieved a Bachelor of Arts-degree. Afterwards, Lukban studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas. In 1888 he achieved his medical license and started his own practice in Manila. Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War After the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution Lukban joined the revolutionary movement, just like his brother Vicente. He served as a medical officer. After the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato on December 15, 1897, Lukban left for Hong Kong together with Emilio Aguinaldo and other Filipino leaders, where they lived in voluntary exile. In Augustus 1898 he was named by Vincente Lukban as Councilor to the Central Directorate of the Hong Kong Military Junta. After his return to the Philippines in 1898, Lukban represented the province of as one of the members of the Malolos Congress. He was a member of the Council of Defense and Aid and head of the Medical Faculty at the newly established Universidad Literaria de Filipinas. He served as a Major in the Siege of Masbate on August 19, 1898. Authorized to collect money for the revolutionary cause, he managed to collect an amount of ‚Ç±20,200 for the Revolutionary Government. When the Philippine Revolutionary Army was defeated in central Luzon by the Americans, Lukban was one of the negotiators for a peaceful surrender to the US as a member of the Asociacion De Paz, which was led by Pedro Paterno and Felipe Buencamino. During that time he had the rank of Major. After his surrender, the Americans appointed him as Military Sanitary Health Inspector for Ambos Camarines. Political career In 1902 Lukban founded, together with Jose Maria de la Vi√±a, Albert Barreto and Le√≥n Mar√≠a Guerrero, the Partido Democrata, which pledged for Philippine independence through peaceful means. In May 1903, Lukban charged the Manila Jockey Club with infringing the Municipal Ordinance, as he claimed horse races are a game of chance and are cruel, with no benefits to horse breeding. In 1906 Lukban was the editor of the La Independencia newspaper, a newspaper which pledged for Philippine autonomy. In January 1907 Lukban ran for the leadership election of the Partido Popular Independista, which urged immediate independence from the United States of America. To prevent further split, Alberto Barretto and Justo Lukban were elected co-leaders of the party.Cullinane (1989), p. 292 On March 12, 1907, the Union Nacionalista and the Independistas merged to form the Partido Nacionalista.Cullinane (1989), p. 293 The Nacionalistas split their ranks when Guerrero and Lukban, members of the old Independista group were dropped from the ticket in favor of Dominador Gomez and Felipe del Pan. In 1907 he took part in the elections for the Philippine Assembly, on behalf of the 1st Legislative District of Manila. He lost the elections to Dominador Gomez. Guerrero and Lukban ultimately set up the Liga Nacional Independencia whose sole purpose was to contest the 1907 elections.Cullinane (1989), p. 305 Lukban ran for the election of Speaker of the Assembly, however Gomez defeated him by 31 votes. Gomez was found to be a Spanish citizen and a new election for his seat in the 1st Philippine Legislature was called. Gomez still ran in the March 30 election and defended his seat, beating Lukban by a larger margin of 425 votes.Cullinane (1989), p. 326 However, on June 18 Gomez resigned his rights to his seat, so a second election was called. The 1908 Manila's 1st assembly district special elections for the vacant seat were thereafter won by Lukban on August 11, 1908. At the end of his term in 1909, he was re-elected. This time, Gomez successfully challenged the election results in court, because Lukban did not conform to the requirement that a candidate needs to reside within his Legislative District. Lukban in turn resigned on January 26, 1911 and Gomez won the special election for the vacant seat. On January 16, 1917, Lukban was appointed as the third Mayor of Manila. During his term as mayor, which would last until March 6, 1920, Rizal Avenue and the Jones Bridge were build. Lukban is mostly known as mayor for his attempts to rid Manila of its prostitutes. Following the suggestion of Sergio Osmena, he shipped a group of 181 prostitutes to Davao, Mindanao, from October 16‚Äì25, 1918. The case caused controversy after the Philippine press wrote about it. In 1920 Governor- General of the Philippines Leonard Wood appointed Lukban to President of the Board of Appeals. Later life After his retirement, he stayed with his daughter in Zurbaran Street, Santa Cruz, Manila. Lukban died in on September 2, 1927 at the age of 64, of a heart ailment. He is buried in Manila North Cemetery. ReferencesSources * Zoilo M. Galang, Encyclopedia of the Philippines, 3 ed. Vol III., E.

Membership included many of New York's most important mid-century artists and thinkers, predominantly painters and sculptors like Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Isamu Noguchi and Robert Motherwell, as well as nearly all the artists later called the New York School. But other celebrated artists, cultural figures and major 20th-century thinkers attended meetings, including philosopher Joseph Campbell, composer John Cage and political theorist Hannah Arendt. Structured to facilitate the growth and dissemination of ideas about art by artists for artists, especially abstract expressionist art, The Club lent New York's art scene the vitality and international influence Paris had long monopolized, and U.S. artists had long craved.  Debating art  Called an \\"outspoken avant-garde thinker\\" by The Boston Globe, Pavia decided to organize regular gatherings of artists, writers and thinkers to socialize and discuss modern art in 1948. The result, inspired by the salons of Paris, ethic groups that then proliferated in Greenwich Village and a post-war desire for art that wasn't borrowed from Europe, was the 8th Street Club, known as \\"the Club,\\" and its 1959‚Äì1970 successor group, also known as the \\"23rd Street Workshop Club.\\" In 1958, Pavia extended the Club's work into a journal, with the short-lived but influential It is. A Magazine for Abstract Art. Originally envisioned as a regular debate about issues in art during twice-weekly lectures, members-only panel conversations and other events, as the Club was also, in part, a response to American artists intimidated by the modernists who had taken refuge in New York after the war. \\"[T]here were geniuses walking in the streets, you know. About 30 of them,\\" Pavia told The New York Times in 2002. \\"They included Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst, Josef Albers, Marcel Breuer, Yves Tanguy, Andr√© Breton and Marcel Duchamp. Matisse came for a visit and everybody lined up to see him.... Eventually, [Pavia] says, the refugees moved uptown, and the Americans decided to take them on.\\" First Pollock rejected surrealism and Jungian imagery, then de Kooning followed suit. After a series of Club lectures on expressionism and abstraction, ideas from both started to merge, and America's first major home-grown abstract art movement was on its way. Carolyn Kinder Carr, the Deputy Director of the National Gallery, explains the process this way: > Those associated with Abstract Expressionism were linked by their rejection > of both social realism and geometric abstraction, two dominant strains in > American art in the 1930s, and by their interest in aspects of European- > based Cubism and Surrealism. For them, art was no longer about copying forms > in nature but was the expression of intangible ideas and experiences. For > some artists, such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Franz Kline, > the subject of art was autobiographical and emerged from the sheer act of > making a painting. For others, among them Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still, > the motivation was a search for the sublime. Yet for all, as Mark Rothko > eloquently postulated, \\"art was not about an experience, but was itself the > experience. The New Yorker's Louis Menand makes another point entirely when he writes about the sheer quantity of \\"formal experimentation and theoretical ferment there was in New York art between 1952 (the year by which the Abstract Expressionists had established themselves) and 1965.... You can see these downtown artists attempting solve a problem inherent in the term 'Abstract Expressionism' itself\\", which he points out is an \\"oxymoron: if something is abstract, it can't express,\\" which explains why \\"there arose a push-pull between abstract forms and figuration (the same thing was happening in Europe) that yielded a rich variety of original work.\\"  Club history  \\"The Club was a schoolhouse of sorts,\\" writes Devin M. Brown, for Burnaway the online Atlanta-based arts magazine, after reviewing Pavia's Archive of Abstract and Expressionist Art at (MARBL), the Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University,Pavia's Archive of Abstract and Expressionist Art at (MARBL), the Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University which owns the collection, \\"but it was also a theater, a gallery space, and a dancehall.... [T]he collection demonstrates how various media constantly overlapped whether simply through discussion or in performance. Concerts, dances, and theatrical pieces were all hosted there. Poets, composers, painters, sculptors, filmmakers, and critics all rubbed elbows and argued with each other about aesthetics at the Club's many panel discussions....\\" \\"Debates at the Club covered a variety of art- and philosophy-related topics, bringing in non-members like Hannah Arendt, Joseph Campbell and John Cage, among others,\\" and bringing together Abstractionists and Expressionists, which helped lend currency to the term \\"Abstract-Expressionism.\\" Art members included Elaine de Kooning, Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell, Landes Lewitin, Aristodimos Kaldis, and Leo Castelli.

The Club also hosted frequent rap-sessions and parties after exhibition openings. [Author Mary] Gabriel emphasizes the abundance of dancing that took place at the Club, quoting Philip Pavia: \\"Franz [Klein] and Joan [Mitchell] would dance 'until they rolled on the floor dancing horizontally.' \\" Morgan Falconer, writing for the blog at the Royal Academy of Arts, echos Winchell's description ‚Äî and Pavia's emphasis on dancing: \\"By day the artists would work, by night they would frequent \\"The Club\\", their private talking-shop, or dance in someone's studio ‚Äì the tango, the jitterbug, even the kazatsky, the Russian folk dance beloved by Communists and Russophiles in the 1930s.\\" \\"The 1950s were critical years for many of the artists involved, and the Club offered a grounding site which bolstered their connections to one another, their confidence, and their status in the broader society.\\" Winchell continues. \\"However, by the time the Abstract Expressionist movement had become the heart of the New York art world and put New York at the center of the international art community, the organization itself was no longer sustainable.... By varying accounts, the Club ceased to exist by the late 1950s or early 1960s ... although it was a significant part of this pivotal time in New York and America's history.\\"  Club community  Once informally known as the Downtown Group, many of the Club's artists were former Federal Art Project artists, including Philip Pavia, Bill de Kooning, Landes Lewitin, Franz Kline and Jack Tworkov.Harold Rosenberg, \\"Tenth Street: A Geography of Modern Art,\\" Art News Annual XXVIII, 1959, New York: Art Foundation Press, Inc. pp. 120‚Äì14 Abstract expressionist art movement in America video documentation project, 1991‚Äì1992. Several had also served in the military during World War II,New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists, (New York School Press, 2000.) p.11-12 and many of them had been \\"gathering in the Village since the late 1930s, and later at the Waldorf Cafeteria at the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 8th Street,\\" until they found themselves unwelcome there and, like the many ethnic clubs that proliferated during that period, they sought a space of their own. This larger group included Conrad Marca-Relli, Franz Kline, Joop Sanders, Milton Resnick, Giorgio Cavallon, Ibram Lassaw, Lutz Sanders, James Brooks, Lewin Alcopley, Frederick Kiesler, John Ferren, and James Rosati.\\" Helmed by Philip Pavia, they rented and repaired a loft at 39 East 8th Street, which was conveniently located at the center of the arts community near Cedar Tavern. > The Club officially opened in October of 1949.

Club members eventually included all, or nearly all, of the New York School, as well as the painters and sculptors ‚Äî so-called Irascibles ‚Äî who boycotted an upcoming \\"monster exhibition\\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's because of the jury's rejection of \\"advanced art,\\" which led to a group photo of the artists for Life Magazine. As abstract expressionism developed, Club membership also extended to numerous forms of it, including action painting, color field, lyrical abstraction, tachisme, color field, Nuagisme and so on. Lectures by luminaries like Joseph Campbell, John Cage and Hannah Arendt, and bi-weekly discussions nurtured artists' theories about art, culture and the artist's role in it. Dislike of French Surrealist influence and challenges to the validity of formalist arguments were common, but weekly discussions at the Club also led to the idea of organizing the 9th Street Art Exhibition as a launching pad. = Painters and sculptors = (Selection was limited by availability.)

Biography He was born in Switzerland, in the capital of the Canton of Ticino, where his printer father also ran a bookshop. During secondary school in Lugano, Carlo Salvioni became acquainted with young anarchists such as Mikhail Bakunin. After interrupting both secondary school and university studies in Basel prematurely, in 1878 Salvioni moved to Germany to enroll at the university of Leipzig, which Tristano Bolelli (1913‚Äì2001) called una delle capitali della glottologia del tempo (one of the capitals of linguistics of the time).quotation concerning Leipzig from Tristano Bolelli, Carlo Salvioni, in Letteratura italiana - I Critici, volume 2, Milano, Marzorati, 1970, p. 1319. Here Salvioni's linguistic studies, based on the school of neo-grammarians, took place with regularity and depth of commitment for five years, from 1878 to 1883. His linguistic studies, however, did not exclude his political interests, which expressed themselves in German socialism.Sergio Lubello, Salvioni, Carlo, in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, volume 90, Treccani, 2017, URL controllato il 12.03.2019. In 1880, during his stay in Leipzig, he met the great Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli and from this meeting his interest in Italian dialectology was born. This interest would fill Salvioni's entire life as a scholar. His doctoral (i.e laurea) thesis, entitled Fonetica del dialetto moderno della citt√† di Milano (Phonetics of the modern dialect of the city of Milan), was published in one volume in 1884.Carlo Salvioni, Fonetica del dialetto moderno della citt√† di Milano, Torino, Ermanno Loescher, 1884. His thesis was the first of his many important contributions to research on dialects, especially from Lombardy, Piedmont and Veneto, but also from the south and islands. Salvioni left some important projects unfinished, such as the edition of Carlo Porta's collected works, the Vocabolario etimologico italiano (Italian etymological vocabulary), and other works. He obtained his doctorate in 1883, two years later he was appointed a free docent in Turin and was then a professor ordinarius at the University of Pavia, until 1902. In that year, after directing the prestigious journal Archivio glottologico italiano, he became Ascoli's successor at the Accademia scientifico-letteraria di Milano. In 1889 he became senator of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1907 he founded the comprehensive, multi-volume Vocabolario dei dialetti della Svizzera italiana (Vocabulary of the dialects of Italian Switzerland), to which he contributed until the last days of life, with the collaboration of his student Clemente Merlo (1879‚Äì1960). Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Salvioni's private life was marked by two very serious losses. His two sons, Ferruccio and Enrico, both died during the first few months of the conflict, after joining the Italian army as volunteers. In October 1929, Salvioni was working on the preparation of a book in memory of his two sons who died in the war, when he died suddenly at the age of 62. In 2008 the Centro di dialettologia e di etnografia (Dialectology and Ethnography Center) of Bellinzona organized a conference for the 150th anniversary of the birth of Carlo Salvioni and for the centenary of the foundation of the Vocabolario dei dialetti della Svizzera italiana (Vocabulary of the dialects of Italian-speaking Switzerland).Loporcaro, M; Lur√†, F; Pfister, M (2010).

She is Professor Emerita at the Universidad Biblica Latinamericana in Costa Rica. She was appointed president of Universidad Biblica Latinamericana in 1995, becoming their first woman president. Biography Elsa T√°mez was born in 1950, in Victoria, Mexico. Raised in the Presbyterian Church, she later joined the Methodist Church. As a young woman, she decided that she wanted to study theology. At that time, women were not accepted into seminaries in Mexico, so she moved to Costa Rica in 1969. She studied at the National University of Costa Rica, graduating with a Bachelor's degree in 1973. She then attended Universidad Biblica Latinamericana, where she earned a Licentiate in Theology in 1979. She earned a second Licentiate in Literature and Linguistics from the National University of Costa Rica in 1986. She later travelled to Switzerland, where she received her Doctorate in Theology from the University of Lausanne in 1990. Her doctoral thesis, Contra toda condena: La justificaci√≥n por la fe desde los excluidos, was published in 1991. T√°mez was Professor of Biblical Studies at the Universidad Biblica Latinamericana in the 1980s. During her career, she has written extensively on Latin American feminist biblical criticism and theology, examining biblical texts in light of the experiences and insights of Latin American women. Her first book, La Biblia de los oprimidos: la opresi√≥n en la teolog√≠a b√≠blica, was published in Spanish in 1979. Translated into English, it was published in 1982 as Bible of the Oppressed. T√°mez was active in the early development of the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EATWOT), and joined with other women from the global south to advocate for a women's commission to be established within EATWOT, to provide support and engagement for women's contributions to theology. She has also been active as a consultant with the Sociedades B√≠blicas Unitas. After several decades of teaching, she was appointed as the president of Universidad Biblica Latinamericana in 1995, becoming the first woman to lead the institution. In 2002, she was the Ernest Monrad Family Visiting Professor of World Christianity at Harvard Divinity School. She has also taught at Vanderbilt University. She edited a volume of Latin American women's theology, Through Her Eyes, in 1989. She published The Amnesty of Grace: Justification by Faith from a Latin American Perspective, in 1993. She has written in depth analysis of the epistles in the New Testament, and has published a book on James as well as First Timothy. Her essay on Hagar entitled, \\"The Woman who Complicated the History of Salvation,\\" was included in New Eyes for Reading: Biblical and Theological Reflections by Women from the Third World. Her article on \\"Cultural Violence against Women in Latin America\\" was included in Women Resisting Violence: Spirituality for Life. In 2000, she was awarded the Hans Sigrist Prize, issued by the University of Bern, in Switzerland. This allowed her to work on a study of the first letter of Timothy, a text that had not been given much study by Latin American scholars. She later published a book on the epistle, Struggles for Power in Early Christianity.

He had an extensive repertoire of songs that he performed in a sturdy, earthy style. In 1953, Dr. Hugh Shields began to notate and record Butcher's songs, published later in two books: Shamrock, Rose & Thistle (1981) and All the Days of his Life (2011), the latter accompanied by a set of three CDs. Starting in 1966, Butcher performed in frequent radio broadcasts from Dublin and Belfast, and recorded four albums of his songs, on one EP and three LPs. He inspired other singers such as Joe Holmes, Len Graham, and Frank Harte, as well as a younger generation of musicians, most notably Andy Irvine and Paul Brady who added musical accompaniment to some of his songs. Early life and employment Eddie Butcher was born on 8 May 1900, in a house that stood on the dividing line between the small townlands of Duncrun and Tamlaght, and lived all his life in Magilligan, County Londonderry, in the far north-west corner of modern Ulster. He was the fifth of John Butcher and Elizabeth Clyde's ten children brought up from the 1890s to the 1920s, and whose names are, in order of seniority: Robert, Katey, Rose, Patrick, Eddie, John, Willy, Maggie, Lily, and Jimmy. All except Lily were singers and those who were old enough learned the core of their repertory from their father, who died in 1920 and had been a daysman, or day labourer for local farmers. Butcher started work by lifting potatoes at the age of 12, and later went for hiring at \\"the Rabble\\" and \\"the Gallop\\", the hiring fairs in Coleraine and Limavady respectively, in May and November. By the time he was 20, he was a daysman himself. In his late twenties, he turned from farm work to a variety of other jobs, such a working as a gardener and handyman, peat-cutting, building, road- making, thatching and working in a quarry, often cycling long distances to and from work each day. Before he retired, he spent 18 years with the Ministry of Agriculture on the River Roe drainage project. Singing career Both Butcher and his wife Gracie (), whom he married in 1933, came from noted local singing families, and whenever there was a dance or another occasion in the vicinity, Butcher's father would be asked to come along to sing, and the brothers and sisters of both families were also well-known performers, locally. During Butcher's childhood, their house was always one of the most popular c√®ilidh houses in Magilligan, with neighbours dropping in regularly for a night of craic, until the practice died out in the area. Before he left home, Butcher learned the greater part of his repertoire from his father and, later, from his brothers and from Gracie's sisters. He also had a gift for writing his own songs, set to traditional airs and often about local events or his own experience as a farm labourer or road worker in later life. From 1953 onwards, he was regularly interviewed by Hugh Shields, who recorded about sixty songs from him within a couple of years, either in manuscript form or, later, through tape recording equipment, and published some of these songs in the 1981 book Shamrock, Rose & Thistle. In 1966, Butcher began to sing frequently on radio from Dublin or Belfast and some of his songs were released on discs, first in 1969 on the EP Adam in Paradise, followed in 1976 by an LP, also titled Shamrock, Rose & Thistle. These radio broadcasts brought him some renown, and attracted the attention of local tradition bearers like Joe Holmes (1906-1978) and Len Graham (b. 1944), with whom he sang and performed. They joined him at his home for the 1975 sessions that yielded two albums of rare Ulster songs: Butcher's I Once Was a Daysman, and Chaste Muses, Bards and Sages by Holmes & Graham. Other frequent visitors to his house included Jackie Devenney (Coleraine), Brian Mullen (Derry), and occasionally Andy Irvine (b. 1942) who, along with Paul Brady (b. 1947), has re-interpreted several of Butcher's songs since the 1970s, often by adding instrumental accompaniment. In 1978, Butcher released his final album: Sings the Titanic and Other Traditional Folk Songs. Two cassettes, featuring eight previously unreleased songs and entitled Shamrock, Rose & Thistle 2 and Shamrock, Rose & Thistle 3, were released posthumously in 1983 by Shields on behalf of the Folk Music Society of Ireland. Some of the songs in Butcher's repertoire had also been collected from other sources by Sam Henry for inclusion in his column, Songs of the People, published weekly in Coleraine's Northern Constitution from 1923 until 1939. This treasury of nearly 700 songs fostered many recordings from the 1950s onwards, and several of these songs are therefore listed as having been recorded by Butcher, and other singers, in the book Sam Henry's Songs of the People, published in 1990.

While historically, national authorities would handle corruption domestically, the increasingly international nature of shipping and corruption have led private and public actors to engage in collective action initiatives, typically manifesting through the work of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network.  Corruption in the Maritime Domain  Elements of the maritime industry like seaports and terminals have always been important areas of social and economic opportunities. Ports are key strategic sectors, playing key economic, internal and international security roles for both developed and developing countries.Operations at Nigerian Sea Ports & Terminals (Report). Convention on Business Integrity. 2018. The strategic importance of ports and other maritime resources have led to the industry being criticized by Maersk, a major shipping company, as ‚Äúan environment where facilitation payments and extortion are common occurrences.‚Äù In the EU specifically, coastal regions and major sea ports have shown to present the highest risks of corruption. Europe's coastal borders have increasingly been subject to corruption pressure by smugglers in the past few years. In addition, border guards and local government officials are often involved in corruption schemes related to cross-border trade. Typically, in European small coastal towns, the corruption of border guards is often related to corruption in local authorities.Anti- Corruption Measures in EU Border Control. Center for the Study of Democracy. 2012 Several ports in Europe have been identified by the Center for the Study of Democracy as having extreme vulnerability to corruption pressures: * Greece: ** Patra Port ** Igoumenititsa Port ** Pireaeus Port * Spain: ** Port of Meililla ** Ceuta Port ** Blue borders near Galicia * France: ** Marseille- Porto Vecchio Sea Port There are several possible causes of this dangerous environment, and many point to the very nature of the shipping industry. Frequent port calls all over the world, each country with different laws and regulations, mixed with heavy bureaucracy leaves the crews of these ships exposed to abuses of power and demands for illicit payments by the port authorities and government officials. The Conference of Business Integrity listed out several factors that contribute to the shipping industry‚Äôs struggle with corruption: * The presence or lack of clear procedures in any areas of port operation; * Exercise of discretionary powers by customs officers and other port agencies; * Existence or absence of a system of bottlenecks made possible due to wide discretionary powers of port officials (and the likelihood of these being used to create extortion opportunities); * Payments for services not rendered by port agencies; * Availability or absence of complaints/feedback desks/redress mechanisms and the effectiveness of such where available These challenges have led to companies and organisations calling for the establishment of a strategic framework for a more transparent and consistent port or terminal system. However, major challenge when governments or organisations attempt to implement this kind of strategic framework is the current lack of clear procedures backed up by laws as well as the discretionary power of custom officers and other port authorities. Even when there are established transparent and consistent procedures, officials have still been able to use discretion on assessing access or noncompliance fees. This is a major challenge that the companies conducting business in Nigeria have encountered. Although policies may be put into place by national authorities, individual officer non-compliance is a major issue to the extent that the National Port Authority as an organisation becomes incompetent in effective management of ports. One way that the National Port Authority has tried to gain some sense of control and awareness of how much corruption is really going on is the implementation of grievance mechanisms. However, only 73% of ports/terminals customers have ever actually used these grievance mechanisms. The inability for national authorities to control the issue of corruption on their own has led to an increasing number of collective action initiatives that combine private companies, regional organisations, and national/local governments as the main actors. These initiatives are typically manifested through the MACN.  Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN)  The Maritime Anti-Corruption Network can best be defined as a certifying business coalition, a coalition between competitors that arguably enhances the strongest degree of fairness between stakeholders by forcing companies to actively create a level playing field. The Maritime Anti-Corruption Network, or MACN, can best be defined as a certifying business coalition, a coalition between competitors that arguably enhances the strongest degree of fairness between stakeholders by forcing companies to actively create a level playing field. The MACN was founded by the Business for Social Responsibility in 2011, triggered by the adoption of the U.K Bribery Act which obliged companies to have ‚Äòadequate procedures‚Äô in place to prevent bribery. Participating in a collective action like MACN can itself be considered a preventative action, so it was a rational choice for many companies wishing to avoid prosecution for inadequate anti-bribery measures. Although MACN is primarily business driven, its strategy emphasizes collaboration with national and local authorities. The MACN is a self-described global business network with the mission of working towards the elimination of all forms of maritime corruption. This mission includes several goals, including raising awareness of corruption challenges; implementing anti-corruption principles; developing and sharing best practices; collaborating with governments, NGOs, and civil society to combat the root causes of corruption; and finally create a 'culture of integrity' within the entire maritime community.MACN Strategy. Maritime Anti-Corruption Network. 2016 MACN has established a strategy for achieving these goals that they have named \\"The Three Cs\\": * Capacity Building ** Focuses on monitoring threats, information sharing, and strengthening internal compliance management of its member companies * Collective Action ** Building sustainable collaborations with governments in order to strengthen accountability across the maritime sector and increase member participation * Culture of Integrity ** Collaborate with key stakeholders and engage in open dialogue to promote integrity culture and increase awareness of industry challenges These strategies have been used for the development of several collective actions which have focused on the implementation of new standard operating procedures (SOPs), the creation of an anonymous incident reporting mechanism, and development of an integrity training toolkit. The collective action initiatives in question have taken place in Nigeria, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, and most recently in India.  Collective Action Initiatives  Nigeria = The collective action initiative between the MACN and the Convention on Business Integrity, an internationally recognized NGO which specializes in West African ethics and anti-corruption, was developed in 2011 to promote integrity and good governance in Nigeria's ports. It was developed with a multi-stakeholder approach in mind, where national port authorities, members of the maritime industry and customs officers would have an opportunity to affect the area in which they worked. The focus of this initiative was to implement face-to-face integrity training, harmonize regulations, and establish grievance mechanisms for each port to offer to captains.MACN Impact Report. Maritime Anti-Corruption Network. 2016. Nigeria is recognized as one of the most challenging countries to do business because of the major risk of facilitation requests and the possibility of extortion, harassment, and threats in the case of a company refusing to pay. The initial survey taken by the MACN showed that frequent demands were made by government agencies, primarily in major ports like Lagos Apapa and Lagos Tin Can. The project was set up in collaboration of the two previously mentioned organisations and several Nigerian anti-corruption agencies: Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC); Technical Unit on Governance and Anti- Corruption Reforms (TUGAR); Bureau for Public Procurement (BPP); and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. 2012 to 2014 marked the risk assessment and scoping stage of the initiative. This stage consisted of identifying forms of corruption, drivers and possible solutions. The risk assessment focused on the ports of Apapa and Tin Can in Lagos, Port Harcourt, Onne, Calabar, and Warri. This assessment highlighted several key risks throughout Nigeria: * Weak internal ethics infrastructure * Insufficiently defined SOPs for port calls * Underdeveloped complaint investigation structures and enforcement practices * A lack of coordination among government agencies * Broad discretionary powers for authorities * Indications of state capture and monopoly (In Onne and Warri specifically)Nigeria Collective Action: MACN Impact Report. MACN Secretariat. 2018. 2015-2017 was the implementation stage. The outcomes of this stage included improved transparency of regulation, strengthened governance frameworks, and an increased stakeholder capacity for anti-corruption management. In 2017, an impact assessment was taken using both qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate changes in incident data as well as qualitative perceptions from industry players and government stakeholders. The implementation of the initiative had a quite positive national reception with a high level of support from the presidency. The government approval was shown through the Vice President's participation in a launch event of the Port Service Support Portal and Accountability Mechanism. In June of 2019, it was announced that the MACN was to strengthen port enforcement, embarking on a partnership with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to develop a Global Port Integrity Index and scale up its collective action activities in West Africa. The Global Port Integrity Index will be based on first-hand data gathered from MACN's anonymous incident reporting mechanism. The scaling up of West African collective action will include working further with international and local maritime organisations as well as Nigerian government authorities so that they can improve the overall maritime climate, reducing maritime corruption. As Denmark is a large player in the international maritime sector, MOFA will be involved in a global anti-corruption program extending support to all levels of public and private level stakeholders. = Argentina = In 2014, after analyzing data from its anonymous incident reporting mechanism, MACN recognized Argentina as a primary area for recurring reports of facilitation requests during the vessel clearing process. Although every cargo ship entering Argentine waters must pass inspections, including those by the Servicio Nacional Sanidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (an Argentine agency that guarantees the quality and healthiness of agricultural products), several problematic incentives were identified for undermining integrity: * Inspections were at the discretion of inspectors; * Failing an inspection is costly for both parties; * Recording inspections with paper records makes data aggregation extremely difficult ; * Systems lack reliable reporting mechanisms for companies seeking to counter alleged non-compliance Therefore, the focus of this initiative was to redraft regulations of a vessel's holds for the loading of agricultural products and develop a new IT system for processing and registering holds/inspections. For this project, MACN has teamed up with its local partner, Governance Latam, a Buenos Aires law firm specializing in compliance and anti-corruption. Part of the strategy for this initiative was interviewing over 40 MACN members, port agents, private surveyors, public inspectors, maritime lawyers, maritime insurance officials, representatives of grain houses, and public officials to get a baseline risk assessment. This broad range of actors was used to ensure a balance between the commercial interests of private stakeholders and the foreign policy interests of Argentina's public domain. As in the Nigeria initiative, the objective of this was to modernize inspection systems to be less discretionary and more transparent. This initiative so far has been a success in implementing a new regulatory framework that: * Reduces discretion in the inspection of holds and tanks; * Establishes a system of cross-checks to increase integrity; * Provides an escalation process when disputes occur; * Creates an e-governance system to underpin the framework Since the implementation of the new regulatory framework, an influx of funding has enabled Governance Latam to carry out training to hundreds of local, private, and public stakeholders, with SENASA establishing the course as official government training material through its Resolution No.693-E/2017. = Egypt = In 2015, MACN developed an initiative in Egypt aimed at combating challenges in Suez Canal transits. The primary focus of this initiative is to encourage captains passing through the Suez Canal to refuse bribery demands. So far, the impacts of this initiative have been a decrease in the frequency of demands, higher number of refusals of demands by captains, and a small development of MACN toolkit use across Africa Operations. MACN has not published any in-depth impact reports on their work in Egypt yet, but \\"Collective Action in Egypt\\" was a topic on the agenda at the 2019 MACN Annual Member Meeting in London. = Indonesia = MACN initiated its collective action initiative in Indonesia in 2015 with a focus on improving tracker IT systems, promoting e-governance systems for cashless export licenses, integrating whistle-blowing procedures, and establishing a forum for discussing and raising awareness about anti-corruption laws and regulations. The project was implemented with support from the Indonesian NGO Kemitraan and the U.K. Foreign Commonwealth Office, co-financed by the UKFCO and MACN. The initial risk assessment gathered that there is a high risk of corruption in ports, with frequent occurrence of illicit facilitation payments. Companies that refuse these payments are typically penalized in some way, whether with delays or non-compliance fees. A key challenge to the initiative was the ambiguous laws and regulations. President Joko Widodo sought to improve performance by improving these regulations and making investments into infrastructure. MACN Collective Action Brief: Indonesia (Report). MACN Secretariat. 2016. Indonesia's ambition to invest and build a more competitive maritime sector by tackling corruption attracted several stakeholders from both the private and public sector. The key stakeholders involved include: * DG Customs & Excise * PT Pelindo II * Corruption Eradication Commission * UKFCO * Kemitraan and Civil Society * MACN member companies The UKFCO has served as the primary public actor aside from the Indonesian government. Their involvement is motivated by the British agenda to combat corruption through private sector engagement, as evidenced by both the 2010 U.K. Bribery Act and 2014 U.K. Anti-Corruption Plan.UK Anti-Corruption Plan. HM Government. 2014 Therefore, a main objective of the initiative is to increase the ease of doing business for British, international and local businesses which operate in Indonesia. Additional objectives include increasing transparency of port operations and the removal of trade barriers. The prevalence of corrupt officials in Tanjung Priok Port, the main port in Jakarta, creates an immediate objective to implement transparent regulations and address integrity risks. The key transparency risks identified by the initiative are the lack of transparent SOPs in Tanjung Priok as well as the tendency for the vessel departure process to rely on cash payments without any receipts, which make corruption and exploitation virtually impossible to detect unless reported. In addition, the whistleblowing systems developed by DG customs and IPC Pelindo II are not used by members of Indonesia's industry, and the systems that are used are quite deficient. Therefore, the key actors of the initiative identified several high level actions to be taken in either a short or long term timeframe: * Short Term: ** PT Pelindo II - establish improved and transparent tracking IT systems ** All Stakeholders - establish a stakeholder forum for government agencies and members of the maritime industry to discuss integrity challenges ** DG Customs - raise awareness about SOPs and regulations * Long Term ** All Stakeholders - integrate whistle-blowing reporting into existing processes and procedures ** DG Customs & MACN - support the establishment of cashless systems for fees Overall, this initiative has so far improved the transparency of importing and exporting regulations through Tanjung Priok port. In addition, the improved dialogue between the public and private sector has increased accountability and responsiveness of key Indonesian government stakeholders. = India = In 2019, it was announced that the Government of India would engage in a collective action with MACN, international organisations, and industry stakeholders. This initiative would include the implementation of integrity training for port officials and establishment of clear escalation and reporting procedures. The overall strategic goal is to reduce and eventually eliminate bottlenecks to trade and other integrity issues during port operations.

On May 27, the Province of Ontario announced that it would take over management of the facility for two weeks. The four other facilities listed included the Sienna-owned Altamont Care Community, which had the third-most amount of deaths. The facility has a capacity of 247 residents, of which 142 became infected. , there were 56 confirmed staff cases. , Eatonville told the CBC that 129 residents and 89 staff had recovered, while 11 residents and 17 staff remained as active cases. Their outbreak has received extensive media coverage, being one of the earliest outbreaks in the province, after Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon. As of mid-April, the facility struggled to maintain staffing levels, despite announcements of provincial support. The Canadian Armed Forces was deployed to five nursing homes in the Greater Toronto Area, in late April, including Eatonville. Their resulting document details both broad and specific reports on neglect in the five facilities. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation summed up the CAF's observations of Eatonville as \\"nothing short of horrid and inhumane as ill-trained, burned-out and, in some cases, neglectful staff coped with the growing care needs of elderly residents.\\" Facility management is said to have investigated after the CAF witnessed \\"aggressive behaviour\\" by staff. Residents were not provided psychosocial supports for their separation from family. Staff would administer pro re nata narcotics or benzodiazepines to sedate the resident, \\"but when you talk to them they just say they're 'scared and feel alone like they're in jail' ‚Äì no agitation or sedation required.\\"Brigadier General C.

Cameron was quickly identified as a possible asset for Western province rugby and was selected for the 2017 Craven Week training squad. Dawson however was not available for selection due to an injury. Cameron did however manage to lead his team to the number five spot in the 2017 National school boy rankings. Cameron was also ranked as the number 83 best overall schoolboy rugby player in the country at the conclusion of his high school rugby carrier in 2017.

A January 17, 1840 article in the Florida Herald of St. Augustine stated, \\"Can anyone inform us why the Mounted Volunteer Company, raised in this city, and now stationed at Hewlett‚Äôs [Hewitt‚Äôs] Mill, is weakened by a detail of ten men subject to the order of the city council, and kept in town idle.\\"Jaye, Randy. (2017) Flagler County, Florida: A Centennial History. St. Petersburg, Florida: Booklocker.com. This article suggests that Fort Fulton was most likely manned with militia volunteers since it was the only military post in the general area of Hewitt's Mill (which was located only about 1500 feet southwest from where Fort Fulton was built). Hewitt's Mill was a sawmill built in 1768 by John Hewitt on his 1,000 acre plot of land in St. Johns County. This sawmill is known to have supplied many wooden building materials to the St. Augustine area and surrounding plantations.Jaye, Randy. Second Seminole War (1835-1842) Fortifications in the Present-day Volusia and Flagler County Area. Halifax Herald, Volume 35, Number 2, Fall 2017. Brief History On May 13, 1840 Joel Roberts Poinsett (1779-1851), who served as the United States Secretary of War from March 7, 1837 to March 5, 1841, sent a correspondence to General Walker Keith Armistead (1773‚Äì1845), commander of the U.S. Army from 1840-1841 during the Second Seminole War that had plans to abandon two forts near St. Augustine in favor of three new forts which were to be established in their place. The two forts to be abandoned were Fort Hanson (located approximately thirteen miles southwest of St. Augustine) and Fort Peyton (originally called Fort Moultrie which was located 6 miles west of St. Augustine). It appears that the only fort that was used as a replacement was Fort Fulton (which was actually built prior to Poinsett's letter). Interestingly, there are no records of the two other forts ever being built in the areas documented in Poinsett's letter. Fort Hanson was abandoned in 1840 and later burned to the ground by the Seminoles and Fort Peyton was abandoned in May 1840 and burned to the ground on February 14, 1842. Operations In addition to militia volunteers Fort Fulton was likely manned by U.S. Army troops on occasion as it was a military outpost that connected St. Augustine to the vast network of plantations to its south. In addition to being utilized for defensive purposes it was likely used for communications and reconnaissance purposes. From a military strategic view it makes sense that a blockhouse would have been located in this area during the Second Seminole War to protect the transportation routes along Old Kings Road and Pellicer Creek. No known attacks or skirmishes were recorded at Fort Fulton.Mahon, John K. (1967) History of the Second Seminole War. Gainesville, Florida: University of Florida Press. Amateur Excavations In the 1970s and 1980s, amateur excavations at the site of Fort Fulton were conducted by Belle Terre Middle School (Palm Coast, Florida) teacher, Buddy Taylor, and several students. Artifacts that were discovered included military buttons, musket shot, and a brass butt plate from a firearm. These artifacts that were collected were displayed at the school's museum for several years. It is not known where the artifacts are located today. Fate Fort Fulton was most likely abandoned, and burned down, sometime around the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842. One map from 1846 includes Fort Fulton, but it is not likely that it was an active military post, or still standing, at that time. Today, the site where Fort Fulton once stood is overgrown with tangled weeds, vines and thick woods. The only visual sign that a blockhouse structure once existed in the area is a clearing of sugar sand among the thickets and trees.Missall, John and Mary Lou Missall.

Ecolog is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With local presence in 5 continents, the company has operations in more than 30 countries and over 150 locations worldwide. History Ecolog International was founded in 1998 by Nazif Destani after discovering German soldiers conducting a NATO engagement for the KFOR mission lacked proper laundry services. The company started with laundry services for the German forces (Bundeswehr) and expanded into a wide variety of services to government, commercial entities and non- profit organizations. By 2005, the company established a headquarters in Dusseldorf, Germany, and reached ‚Ç¨131 million in sales. In 2007, Destani stepped down from managing day-to-day operations of Ecolog but maintained oversight as the chairman of the company. Destani was succeeded as CEO by Ant√≥nio Gon√ßalves, Paul Broekhuijesen, Adil Toubia in 2017, and, in mid 2019, by Ali Vezvaei. Operations Ecolog International's infrastructure includes air service, logistics, fuel, water, catering, storage, construction, industrial services and facility management, disinfection and cleaning, laundry, mobile lavatories, energy supply and waste management, all of which are widely used by oil and gas and mining operations as well as government and defence contractors, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations (NGO), including the United Nations. The company has been contracted to work with the Royal Dutch Shell, Samsung, Petronas, Weatherford International, and Qatar Gas, as well as the U.S. Army, the United Nations, the UK Ministry of Defence, the Bundeswehr, NATO and the French Army. The company operates under the guidelines set by the ISO9001, ISO14001, and OHSAS 18001 ISO Certifications. Ecolog underwent a due diligence process in 2018 and was certified by Trace International and is a supporter of the ten principles of the United Nations‚Äô Global Compact by adopting sustainable and socially responsible policies on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. The company has established several partnerships and portfolio expansions since mid-2019, including establishing its new Eco-Care Solution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well Ecolog Energy Solution as its water and power divisions focused on harnessing the most abundant resources, seawater and sunshine. =Corporate leadership= In mid-2019, oil and gas executive Ali Vezvaei joined Ecolog International as the Group CEO and the CEO of the Management Board. =Philanthropy= Ecolog partnered with the United States Agency for International Development Small Business Expansion Project to launch the Support Fund For Women and Youth Entrepreneurs in 2014 to create more jobs in the Polog region of Macedonia. In March 2017, the company partnered with the German Embassy to donate a variety of trees to the Center for Culture in Tetovo, Macedonia. In December 2018, the company donated computers to create a computer lab at the University of Bangui in the Central African Republic. Ecolog donated mobile school facilities in the Al Nasr community, Iraq, located 50km away from Baghdad. On 26 November 2019, northwestern Albania was struck by a powerful earthquake that killed and injured many citizens. Ecolog responded by offering transportation and donating supplies to rescue workers. In April 2020, the company donated thousands of electronic devices to students in various parts of North Macedonia to support distance learning in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. =Sponsorships= Since 2013, the company has sponsored KF Shk√´ndija football club in Tetovo, North Macedonia. In 2016, the company took the club's home stadium, Tetovo City Stadium, under concession and renovated the stadium including adding seating and floodlights that enabled the stadium to host international matches. The stadium was renamed Ecolog Arena in July 2016. Criticisms Between 2006 and 2009, Ecolog was criticized in the German press for using a laundry detergent that gave German soldier's uniforms a pink tint, allowing them to be more visible on night vision goggles, not properly treating black water and failing to properly prepare diesel fuel for adverse weather. Ecolog investigated the matter in conjunction with Germany‚Äôs Ministry of Defense which concluded that the issue was a minor disruption which had been fully identified and corrected. In 2014, an Al Jazeera America story accused Ecolog and other contractors in Afghanistan of outsourcing hiring recruiters who charged prospective employees an agent fee to secure employment with the company. The company told reporters that such alleged practices were against company‚Äôs recruitment policy and that it welcomed direct applications. In 2017, news surfaced that Ecolog drivers had been accused of taking bribes to transport civilians from the city of Bangassou after U.N. peacekeepers refused to evacuate them. According to the story, Ecolog drivers accepted up to $100 per person bribes to transport civilians from the town. As a result, officials from the MINUSCA mission sent a letter to the company asking that it steps to prevent the civilian transports in the future. After an investigation conducted by the company, one driver was found to have accepted bribes to transport civilians. The driver was immediately dismissed in November 2017. In May 2018, several items were discovered in a truck in Ippy, Central African Republic, which was servicing the United Nations peacekeeping mission under Ecolog‚Äôs contract. Ecolog investigated the incident in conjunction with United Nations officials, with the conclusion that Ecolog was not involved and the trafficking act was committed unilaterally by third-party subcontractor‚Äôs drivers in their own capacity. Awards and recognition In 2019, the company publicized its Communication on Progress of its commitments to the UN Global Compact. The company received a gold award from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) in 2017 and 2018 for its safety and security protocols. It was also recognised by RoSPA with the gold award in 2020.Winners in 2020 ReferencesExternal links *ND Group website Category:German companies established in 1998 ","title":"Ecolog International"},{"id":"64098606","text":"Bob Berney (born 1953) is an American independent film executive based in Los Angeles.

It was in the historic province of Berry up to 1790. History The first recorded mention of Lalande dates from the mid-15th century. At that time the Seigneur of the domaine was Jacques de Lalande. His neighbour, Guillaume du Boueix, was brutally murdered (according to local tradition, he was killed in front of his family whilst on his way to church). Jacques de Lalande married Marie, the widow, in 1448, whilst his brother, Jean de Lalande, married the sister of their unfortunate neighbour. He spent the rest of his life seeking justice through the courts against the murderer, Huguet de Chamborant. In the 16th century the current ch√¢teau was built, by the side of the lake. The east wing with its huge square towers, defences and semi-circular tower, dates from this period.

The project was formed to produce a US$10 million advertising campaign focused on 100 testimonials by Republicans, conservatives, moderates, right-leaning independent voters, and former Trump voters explaining why they would not vote for Donald Trump in 2020. By August 2020, they had collected 500 testimonials.  Strategy  The advertising campaign targets white college-educated suburban voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona. Paul Waldman, writing for The Washington Post compared the campaign to a similar 1964 Lyndon Johnson ad called \\"Confessions of a Republican\\" giving Republicans \\"permission\\" to vote against Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. Ad space purchased on social media and Fox News was scheduled to start the first week of June 2020. An ad produced by RVAT featuring Trump's descriptions of the coronavirus pandemic was planned to air during the Republican National Convention in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida and Pennsylvania.  Ads featuring former Trump officials  In August 2020, former senior official in the Trump administration Miles Taylor filmed a spot, calling Trump \\"dangerous\\" and saying \\"What we saw week in and week out, for me, after two and a half years in that administration, was terrifying. We would go in to try to talk to him about a pressing national security issue -- cyberattack, terrorism threat -- he wasn't interested in those things. To him, they weren't priorities.\\" Later that month another former Homeland Security staffer from the Trump administration, Elizabeth Neumann, made an ad in which she endorsed Biden and called Trump \\"racist\\" and \\"a threat to America.\\" In September, Olivia Troye, former homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to Vice President Pence and aide to the White House Coronavirus Task Force filmed an ad endorsing Biden.  Ads featuring other high-profile individuals  In October 2020 former CIA director and retired General Michael Hayden made an ad for the group.

Kanter is an American academic, lawyer and a Bond, Schoeneck and King Distinguished Professor of Law at Syracuse University College of Law. In 2005, she was named the Laura J. and L. Douglas Meredith Professor of Teaching Excellence by Syracuse University. She is the founder and director of the Disability Law and Policy Program and director of the Office of International Programs.  Early life and education  Kanter was born and raised in Newton Centre, Massachusetts. Kanter is a graduate of Trinity College (B.A. 1976, with honors), New York University (J.D. 1981, with honors), and Georgetown University Law Center (LL.M. 1983). At Georgetown, Kanter was awarded a Graduate Fellowship at the Institute for Public Representation, where she represented the plaintiffs in, Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, a case that was resolved by the United States Supreme Court in 1983.  Legal career  Prior to joining the law faculty at Syracuse University College of Law, Kanter taught at Georgetown University Law Center and practiced public interest law at a national disability rights organization in Washington, D.C., known then as the Mental Health Law Project, and today as the Bazelon Center on Mental Health Law. At the Mental Health Law Project she was director of the community living project and litigated cases on behalf of people with mental disabilities seeking to leave institutions and live in their own homes in the community. One of those cases, City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., is legally significant because the Supreme Court struck down a zoning policy that discriminated against people with mental disabilities under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, using only the rational basis test. Since joining the Syracuse law faculty, she has continued to remain involved in disability rights litigation and advocacy as a consultant to various international and domestic disability organizations and academic institutions. She is a former co-founder and Chair of the American Bar Association Commission on Homelessness, and former Commissioner of the American Bar Association Commission on Disability. From 2001 to 2006, Kanter worked with the United Nations Committee on drafting the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD). Today, she continues to consult with governments and disability organizations on implementing the CRPD in more than 20 countries.  Academic career  Kanter joined the tenure track faculty of Syracuse University College of Law in 1988, when she was appointed Director of Clinical Legal Education and director of the law school‚Äôs only civil clinic, the Public Interest Law Firm, which later became the Disability Rights Clinic. During her tenure as Director of Clinical Legal Education, Kanter started six new clinics, all of which continue today. She also founded and directed the Externship Program, which has been expanded to different cities. In recognition of the accomplishments of the Office of Clinical Legal Education, the College of Law received the Emil Gumbert Award for Advocacy Programs from the AALS in 1990. Kanter also served as the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, during which time she introduced support for students with disabilities and a first year elective course program. In 2005, she stepped down as Director of Clinical Legal Education and Director of the Externship Program to co-direct the Center on Human Policy, Law and Disability Studies (now part of the Center on Disability and Inclusion) and to found and direct the Disability Law and Policy Program, which is now the most extensive disability law school program in the world. Kanter teaches Disability Law, International Human Rights and Comparative Disability Law, Advanced Disability Law and Policy, Legislation and Policy, and Special Education Law, among other courses. She holds a courtesy appointment at the Syracuse University School of Education. Kanter has been a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School (Fall 2017); Tel Aviv University Faculty of Law, as a Fulbright Scholar (2010‚Äì11); Hebrew University Faculty of Law (1994‚Äì95; 2010‚Äì11); NALSAR University, India (Spring 2010); Charles University, Czech Republic (November 1993 and June 1994); and a Graduate Teaching Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center (1981‚Äì83). Kanter is co-founder and inaugural Chair of the Disability Law Section of the American Association of Law Schools and co-founder of the Disability Research Group of Law and Society Organization.  Honors and awards  Professor Kanter was named the Lady Davis Fellow at Hebrew University Faculty of Law in 2018; Fulbright Scholar at Tel Aviv University in 2009-10; and the 2010 Distinguished Switzer Fellow of the US Department of Education‚Äôs National Disability Rehabilitation Research Institute. Professor Kanter has been honored with awards from the Association of American Law Schools, American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, the Association of Higher Education and Disability, the Syracuse International Center, and the Israeli Human Rights Center for People with Disabilities. In 2020, the Disability Law and Policy Program was named one of the most innovative higher educational programs in the world by the Zero Project of the Essl Foundation.

Subsequent Indo-European traditions and myths feature parallel linkages between property- less adolescent males, perceived as an age-class not yet fully integrated into the community of the married men; their service in a \\"police-army\\" sent away for a part of the year in the wild (where they hunted animals and raided foreign communities) and defending the host society during the remaining part of the year; their mystic self-identification with wolves and dogs as symbols of death, promiscuity, lawlessness, and warrior fury; and the idea of a liminality between invulnerability and death on one side, and youth and adulthood on the other side.  Etymology and name  The Proto-Indo-European term *k√≥ryos denotes a \\"people under arms\\" and has been translated as \\"army, war-band, unit of warriors\\", or as \\"detachment, war party\\". It stems from the root *k√≥ros (\\"cutting, section, division\\"), attested in Old Persian as kƒÅra (\\"people, army\\") and in Lithuanian as k√£ras (\\"war, army\\"). The term *k√≥ryos has descendant cognates in the Greek kouros ('youth, boy'), Baltic *kƒÅryas ('army'), Celtic *k√≥ryos ('troop, tribe'), and Germanic *harjaz ('host, troop, army, raiding-party'). The Gallic tribes Uo-corri ('two-armies'), Tri-corii ('three-armies') and Petru-corii ('four-armies') were presumably formed from alliances of roving war-bands. In West Central Indo-European dialects, the designation *koryonos ('leader of the *k√≥ryos'; here attached to the suffix -nos 'master of') is also attested: Ancient Greek ko√≠ranos ('army leader'), Old Norse Herjan (< PGmc *harjanaz; 'leader of the army'), and Brittonic Coriono-totae ('people of the army-leader'). The root *harja- is also part of compound names in Germanic languages, such as Herigast (Heregast), possibly attested as Harikast on the Negau helmet. Some toponyms in Western Europe, such as Cherbourg in France or Heerlen in the Netherlands, may stem from historical ethnic groups whose name contained the Celtic root *k√≥rio- (\\"army, troop\\"), as proposed by Pierre-Yves Lambert. Additionally, the Asturian personal name Vacoria (similar to Gaulish Vocorius) has been interpreted as stemming from the Celtic ethnic name *(d)uo-korio ('possessing two armies'), and the Gallic tribal name Coriosolites as meaning 'those who watch over the troop', or those who purchase soldiers or mercenaries'. In Indo-European studies, the modern German term M√§nnerbund (\\"men-band\\") is often used to refer to the *k√≥ryos. However, it can be misleading since the war-bands were made up of adolescent males, not grown-up men. Some scholars have proposed the terms Bruderschaft or Jungmannschaft as preferable alternatives.  Description  Rite of passage = The k√≥ryos were composed of adolescent males (presumably from 12‚Äì13 up to 18‚Äì19 years of age), usually coming from prominent families and initiated together into manhood as an age-class cohort.; ; ; After undergoing painful trials to enter the group, they were sent away to live as landless warriors in the wild for a number of years, within a group ranging from two to twelve members. The young males went without possession other than their weapons, living on the edges of their host society. Social behaviour normally forbidden, such as stealing, raiding or sexually assaulting women, were therefore tolerated amongst k√≥ryos members, as long as the malevolent acts were not directed at the host society.; ; Their activities were seasonal, and they lived with their home community for a part of the year.ephebe. Their life was centred on military duties, hunting wild animals and pillaging settlements on one side; and on the recitation of heroic poetry telling the deeds of past heroes and cattle theft legends on the other side. A tradition of epic poetry celebrating heroic and violent warriors conquering loot and territories (which were portrayed as possessions the gods wanted them to have) probably participated in the validation of violence among the k√≥ryos. The leader of the band was determined with a game of dice, and the result accepted as the gods' choice. The other members pledged to die for him, and to kill for him. He was regarded as their master in the rite of passage, but also as their \\"employer\\" since the young warrior served as his bodyguards and protectors. The period of initiation within the k√≥ryos was perceived as a transitional stage preceding the status of adult warrior and was usually crowned by marriage.; The k√≥ryos were symbolically associated with death and liminality, but also with fecundity and sexual license. McCone has argued that members of the *k√≥ryos initially served as young unmarried males without possessions before their eventual incorporation into the *teut√©h‚Çê- (\\"the tribe, people under arms\\"), composed of the property-owning and married adult males. According to Anthony and Brown, the k√≥ryos may have served \\"as an organization promoting group cohesion and effectiveness in combat, as an instrument of external territorial expansion, and as a regulatory device in chiefly feast-centred economies.\\" In Europe, those oath-bound initiatory war- bands were eventually absorbed by increasingly powerful patrons and kings during the Iron Age, while they got downgraded in ancient India with the rise of the Brahmin caste, leading to their progressive demise. = Role in the Indo-European migrations = Scholars have argued that the institution of the k√≥ryos played a key role during the Indo-European migrations and the diffusion of Indo-European languages across Eurasia.; ; Raids headed by the young men could have led to the establishment of new settlements on foreign lands, preparing the ground for the larger migration of whole tribes including old men, women and children.; This scenario is supported by archaeological data from the early Single Grave‚ÄìCorded Ware Culture in Jutland, where 90 per cent of all burials belonged to males in what appears to be an expansion on the territory of the Funnelbeaker culture. The k√≥ryos probably drove people not protected by the Indo-European social umbrella to move under it in order to obtain safety or restitution from thieving and raiding. They could therefore have served as an incentive for the recruitment of outsiders into social positions that offered vertical mobility, horizontal reciprocity, and the possibility of immortality through praise poetry, made more attractive by generosity at patron-sponsored public feasts.  Attributes  Wolf-like behaviour = The war-bands consisted of shape-shifting warriors wearing animal skins to assume the nature of wolves or dogs. Members of the k√≥ryos adopted wolfishly behaviours and bore names containing the word \\"wolf\\" or \\"dog\\", each a symbol of death and the Otherworld in Indo-European belief.; ; The idealized attributes of the k√≥ryos were indeed borrowed from the imagery surrounding the wolf: violence, trickery, promiscuity, swiftness, great strength, and warrior fury.; ; By identifying with the wild animals, k√≥ryos members perceived themselves as physically and legally moved outside the human world, and therefore no longer restrained by human taboos. When returning to their normal life, they would feel no remorse for breaking the rules of their home society because they had not been humans or at least not living in the cultured space of the host society when those rules were broken. In Ancient Greece, the wolfish ways of fighting were reserved to the adolescent groups passing the warrior initiation. Young members of the Athenian ephebos and the Spartan crypteia were able to use war techniques usually forbidden to the adult warrior: they covered their actions and prowled at night, using tricks and ambushes. The ephebos in particular were under the patronage of the god Apollo, associated in many myths with wolves and bearing the epithet Lykeios. During his initiation, the Irish mythical hero Cuchulainn, a typical depiction of the k√≥ryos member, changed his youth name from Setantae to \\"hound of Culainn\\". The young members of the Ossetic balc were strongly associated with the wolf and described as a k'war (\\"herd\\"). The Avestan literature also mentions the mairy≈ç (\\"wolf, dog\\") as the young male serving in warrior- bands.Woodcut image of one of the 252x252pxIn the Norse tradition, berserkers were sometimes called √∫lfhe√∞nar (\\"wolf-skinned\\"), and the frenzy warriors wearing the skins of wolves were designated as ulfhedinn (\\"wolf-coat\\"). The folk legends of the werewolf (\\"man-wolf\\") found in the Germanic, the Slavic (*v—ålkodlaci ‚Äòwolf-haired ones‚Äô) and the Baltic traditions (Lithuanian vilkt√£kai \\"running as wolves\\") is probably reminiscent of the wolfishly behaviour of the warrior-bands. = Warrior-fury = The conflicting opposition between death and invulnerability is suggested by the attributes generally associated with the k√≥ryos: great strength, resistance to pain, and lack of fear. The Indo-European term for a 'mad attack' (*eis), in particular, is common to the Vedic, Germanic, and Iranian traditions. The typical state of warrior fury or frenzy was supposed to increase his strength above natural expectations, with ecstatic performances accentuated by dances and perhaps by the use of drugs. The Germanic berserkers were depicted as practitioners of the battle fury (\\"going berserk\\", berserksgangr), while the martial fury of the Ancient Greek warrior was called lyssa, a derivation of lykos (\\"wolf\\"), as if the soldiers temporarily become wolves in their mad rage. As such, young males were perceived as dangers for their host society. The mythical Maruts of the Vedic tradition were depicted as both beneficial and dangerous entities. The Irish hero C√∫chulainn becomes a terrorizing figure among the inhabitants of the capital-city, Emain Macha, after he has beheaded three rivals from his own people (the Ulaid). They decide to capture him and plunge his body into basins of water to \\"cool him down\\". Similarly, some Greek warrior-bands were called hybrist·∏ós (·ΩëŒ≤œÅŒπœÉœÑŒÆ) and portrayed as violent and insolent groups of ransomers and looters. Irish sources also describe some warrior-bands in particular as savages (d√≠berg), living like wolves by pillaging and massacring. = Nudity = Many kurgan stelae found in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and associated with the Proto-Indo-European culture depict a naked male warrior carved on the stone with little else than a belt and his weapons. In later Indo-European traditions, k√≥ryos raiders likewise wore a belt that bound them to their leader and the gods, and little else. In Ancient Greek and Roman literary sources, the Germani and Celts were often portrayed as fighting naked or semi naked, armed only with light weapons. At the battle of Telamon (225 BC), Gallic warriors reportedly wore only trousers and capes. In the Norse tradition, Berserker usually scorned the use of an armour to favour animal skins, and they were sometimes also said to fight naked. Ancient Italic tribes had in their ranks berserk-like warriors who fought naked, barefoot, flowing- haired, and often in single combat. Similarly, young Vedic boys wore only a belt and an animal skin during their initiation within the k√≥ryos. Celtiberian statuettes from the 5th‚Äì3rd centuries BC depict naked warriors with a sword, a small round shield (caetra), a \\"power belt\\", and sometimes a helmet. The tradition of kurgan stelae featuring warriors with a belt is also common in the Scythian cultures. According to military historian Michael P. Speidel, the scene 36 of Trajan Column, which shows bare-chested, bare-footed young men wearing only a shield, could be a depiction of Germanic Berserkers. =Darkness= The k√≥ryos is usually associated with the colour black, or at least dark, and with the mobilization of chtonic forces. Frequent references are made to the \\"black earth\\" or the \\"dark night\\" in the Indo-European literature, and hunting and fighting at night appears to have been one of the distinguishing characteristics of the k√≥ryos. In the Vedic tradition, the followers of Indra and Rudra wear black clothes, and the young heroes of Medieval Armenia were called \\"black youths\\" (t‚Äòux manuks). The \\"black\\" Aram is the idealized figure of the k√≥ryos leader in Armenian myths, and his armies are said to suddenly attack adversaries \\"before dawn\\" in the borderlands of Armenia. The Athenian ephebes traditionally wore a black chlamys, and the Ancient Greek tradition featured an initiation ritual imposed upon young males in which \\"black hunters\\" were sent out to the frontier to perform military exploits. Indeed, the Greek model of the black hunter, Meleager, is named after the word for \\"black\\" (melas), and the Armenian name Aram stems from the root *rƒì-mo- (\\"dirt, soot\\"). The Roman historian Tacitus (1st c. AD) also mentions the Germanic Harii (whose name could derive from *k√≥ryos) as \\"savages\\" wearing black shields, dyeing their bodies, and choosing dark nights for battle. Kershaw has proposed that the Harii were the k√≥ryos of the neighbouring Lugii tribe.  Attestations  Krasnosamarskoe = At Krasnosamarskoe (Volga steppes) were found 51 dogs and 7 wolves sacrificed and consumed in what could have been a winter-season rite of passage into a status represented metaphorically by the animals. The site is associated with the Srubnaya culture (1900‚Äì1700 BC), generally regarded as proto-Iranian, and possibly made up of archaic Iranian speakers. Krasnosamarskoe appears to have been a place where people from around the region came to periodically engage in transgressive initiation rituals conducted in the winter and requiring dog and wolf sacrifice. According to Anthony and Brown, \\"it was a place of inversion, as is the eating of wolves, animal symbolic of anti-culture (a murderer 'has become like a wolf' in Hittite law; 'wolf' was used to refer to brigands and outlaws, people who stand outside the law, in many other Indo- European languages).\\" The dogs found on the site seem to have been well- treated during their lifetime, and they were probably familiar pets. The ritual was centred on dog sacrifice in a region and time period when dogs were not normally eaten. Cattle and sheep were indeed consumed throughout the year on the site, whereas dogs were killed almost exclusively in the winter in a regular inversion of normal dietary customs. = Indian tradition = In the Vedic tradition, young boys began the initiation at 8 years old, studying heroic poetry about past ancestors and practicing the hunting and fighting skills. At 16, they were initiated into a warrior band during the winter solstice ritual (the EkƒÅstakƒÅ), during which the boys went into an ecstatic state and ritually died to be reborn as dogs of war. After a dice game had determined their leader, the initiated were cast away in the wild for four years to live as dogs, stealing animals, women, goods and territory until the summer solstice ended the raiding season. The young warriors then returned to their forest residence where they held a VrƒÅtyastoma sacrifice to thank the gods for their success. At the end the four-year initiation, a final VrƒÅtyastoma sacrifice was performed to transform the dog-warrior into a responsible adult man, and the newly-initiated males then destroyed their old clothes to become human once again, ready to return to their family and to live by the rules of their community. The VrƒÅtyas (\\"dog-priests\\") were known for performing the EkƒÅstakƒÅ ceremony at the winter solstice, when Indra, the god of war, is said to have been born with his band of Maruts. The term VrƒÅta is used in particular the Rigveda to describe the Maruts. = Iranian tradition = The Scythians probably led military expeditions as a mandatory initiation into manhood which lasted for several years, as suggested by historical raids in Anatolia. In the Ossetic tradition, a compulsory initiation into manhood involved a military expedition known as the balc and lasting for one year. Groups were formed during spring feast (Styr T≈´tyr), dedicated to the master of wolves and warriors. The rite of passages took place in Varkazana (the \\"month of men-wolves\\"; October‚ÄìNovember), during the feast of Wastyrgi.'''' = Greek tradition = In Ancient Greece, the traditional war-bands have lost some of the element of frenzy that characterizes shape shifters in other Indo-European culture, although they still maintained the terror-inspiring appearance and the tricky war tactics of the original k√≥ryos. From 17 to 20 years old, the Athenian ephebos had to live during the 2 years in the ephebeia (·ºêœÜŒ∑Œ≤ŒµŒØŒ±). Relegated to the edges of society, they were given a marginal status without a full citizenship. Their duty was to guard the limit of their community during peaceful times, generally as guards of fields, forests, and orchards. Leading ambushes and skirmishes in war time, the ephebos wore black tunics and were lightly armed. An essential part of their training was the traditional hunt, conducted at night with the use of snares and trap. In the case of the Spartan krypteia, it was even a human hunt. The Spartan krypteia consisted of young men called agelai (\\"herds\\") and led by a boagos (\\"leader of cattle\\"). A similar formation, the Irenas (·º∞œÅŒ≠ŒΩŒ±œÇ) were in charge of overseeing Helots and assisting in the krypteia. The Greek colony of Taras is said to have been founded by a group of 20-year-old Spartan Partheniae who were refused citizenship in order to encourage them to leave their hometown and found a new settlement. Herodotus mentions the myth of Aristodemus, who fought courageously but was refused the recognition as best fighter by the Spartans because he got \\"mad\\" (lyss√¥nta) and abandoned the formation, suggesting that Ancient Greeks thought that berserk-acting warriors had no place in the phalanx formation. = Germanic tradition = Romano-Germanic deity Hercules Magusanus has been interpreted as the patron-figure of the Batavian k√≥ryos (226 AD). During the first centuries of the Common Era, the Celto-Germanic tribal societies of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior probably included formations of young men which represented a significant political force within their host communities because of their military nature. Among the Batavi, the Romano-Germanic god Hercules Magusanus was likely regarded as the patron and protector of the Batavorum iuventus, a sort of paramilitary organization preparing young men for the soldier's life. Vikings were made up of groups of young people led by an adult male during a three-year campaign overseas. The social group consisting of the grown-up men (the \\"former youths\\") only joined the formation where time had come to settle in the conquered lands. Indeed, during the Viking Age, the raids lasted for two centuries before a definite colonization occurred in regions like modern-day Britain, France or Russia. In the 13th-century Icelandic Volsunga Saga, Sigmund trains his nephew Sinfjotli to harden him for later conflicts by sneaking with him through the forest dressed in wolf skins, thieving and killing. In a scene that can be compared to the Vedic tradition and the archeological site of Krasnosamarskoe, they removed their wolf skins and burned them at the end of the initiation, since they were ready to return to the host community and follow a life constrained by its social taboos. = Italic tradition = The Italic Ver Sacrum involved the departure of an entire age group in order to found a \\"colony\\". In particular, the story of the Mamertines and the Roman Ver Sacrum dedicated in 217 AD by the decimviri sacris faciundis explicitly state that participating members were young people. = Celtic tradition = In the Irish Fenian Cycle, the fianna are depicted as troops of warriors recruited among young people to watch over Ireland as an army-police led by the mythical hunter-warrior Finn. They had to live outdoor in the woods and hills of Ireland from May until October, feeding themselves only by hunting. From November to April, the fianna went back to their family farms scattered over the island. = Armenian tradition = The manuks (\\"young warriors\\") are mentioned in the story of the legendary founder of Armenia Hayk. His descendant, Aram, interpreted as the \\"second image of Hayk\\", heads an army of 50,000 norati (\\"youths\\") warriors extending the borders of the territory on every side to create a new, superior Armenia. Contrary to Hayk, who is fighting his adversary within the territory of Armenia, Aram makes war in the borderlands and beyond the borders of Armenia. According to Armen Petrosyan, this suggests that the young warriors of Aram can be interpreted as a reflex of the k√≥ryos, and Hayk's soldiers as the depiction of the adult men in arms.

Prior to earning his PhD in 1929 from Budapest University, he spent a year in Cairo to help organize a botanical museum. In 1930 he started work at Hungarian National Museum where he was the curator of the lichen collections. Gyelnik married Theresa Hofflinger on 30 May 1930, with whom he had a son in 1932. Gyelnik maintained a friendly correspondence with American amateur lichenologist Charles Christian Plitt for several years until Plitt's death in 1933. In the 1930s, it was common for Hungarians with non-Hungarian sounding names to alter them if they desired political appointments. Gyelnik prefixed K≈ëfarag√≥ (meaning \\"stone-cutter\\") to his name in 1935, and eventually became the head of the Botanical Department of the museum in 1942. On March 15, 1945, Gyelnik was killed in Austria by Allied bombing. Gyelnik published about 100 papers on lichens in the period 1926 to 1945, and proposed hundreds of new names, particularly in the genera Alectoria, Nephroma, Parmelia, and Peltigera. His work, however, was not without detractors, who thought he published too hastily, and sometimes forgot what he had published earlier. According to Mason Hale, Gyelnik \\"infuriated or at least antagonized virtually every contemporary lichenologist\\". Gyelnik is honoured in the name of the species Psorotichia gyelnikii.

She campaigned against the Contagious Diseases Act and founded the National Anti Compulsory Vaccination League. Life Rothery was born in London in 1824. Her parents were Mary and Joseph Hume, she was their youngest daughter and Allan Octavian Hume was her brother. Her father was a member of parliament who was concerned with the British Museum and was a founder of University College, London. Her mother, also Mary, was the daughter of Hardin Burnley. She married the Reverend William Hume and the two of them adopted the name Hume-Rothery in 1866 which was the surname of their son James Hume Rothery when he was born in 1866. She and her husband had lived near Hexham in the 1860 where William was the curate, before they moved to south-west England to live at Cheltenham. Publication in 1880 She wrote and published a biography of Charles Augustus Tulk and an explanation of his ideas. Tulk was a friend of her father's who had persuaded her to become a Swedenborgian. He was not a member of this New Church, but his writings on the church founder's ideas about the 'law of correspondence' were addressed to the church members. In 1871 Rothery published Women and Doctors; Or, Medical Despotism in England. Its key message was to resist government control of medicine that was discriminating against medicine that that was not from trained doctors. Her mentor, Tulk, was an enthusiast for phrenology and mesmerism. Rothery also campaigned against men getting involved in the treatment of women when it came to gynaecological examinations and she objected to men becoming midwifes. Her solution to this was to encourage women to become doctors and she forwarded this idea and the introduction of women's suffrage in her 1870 publication A Letter Addressed to the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone. This fitted in with idea that it was male doctors who had assisted with the Contagious Diseases Act that blamed prostitutes for the spread of sexual disease. She was opposed to this act and Rothery was an invited speaker at Josephine Butler's Ladies' National Association. In 1874 she and William founded the National Anti Compulsory Vaccination League (NACVL). Her husband led the Anti-vaccination organisation and she was the honorary secretary.

In the late 1940s, Israel wrote, there were generally no boutiques catering exclusively for juniors and hardly any clothing companies producing styles for the juniors market. Israel wrote that she developed numerous groundbreaking concepts that were copied by other designers and retailers, such as the short-sleeve sweater and workmen's five- pocket jeans for casual use (accessorized with Ked's sneakers) by women.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marcia-israel-curley/defying- the-odds/ Israel was long considered a fashion authority; for example a 1970 interview in the Los Angeles Times around the topic of longer hemlines for women's skirts. Israel confirmed that longer midi skirt hemlines were \\"flourishing\\", though the lower hemlines \\"should not be forced; they must ripen like fruit\\". The Judy's \\"empire\\" was considered a \\"bellwether by great numbers of astute fashion people\\", according to the Times. Development of stores Israel began the chain in January, 1946 in a 7-by-12-foot space (84 sq. ft.) carved out of a movie theater lobby on Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles. She proceeded to open a 360-square-foot store in 1948 in Compton, an 800-square-foot store on May 9, 1949 on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood, and in 1952, a 3,500-square-foot store in the new Lakewood Center, the United States' first fully-enclosed mall. The chain continued to expand, including the opening of a store in Century City Shopping Center in July 1965, expanded in 1968 to which it considered its flagship store. By 1970, there were 17 Judy's. The chain at its peak it had 107 stores. In 1989, it operated 70 women's clothing stores and 34 \\"GHq\\" men's clothing stores in California and a handful in four other Western states. Epilogue In 1993 the chain declared bankruptcy, disposed of the GHq men's chain and relaunched with a slimmed-down 52-store branch network.

She was the founder of the Brazilian variant of the Femen group, but after the second half of 2013 she worked in her own group, BastardXs. As of 2015, she joined the \\"Pro-Woman group\\", at the same time that she started to fight against the agendas she once defended, including the social construction of genders, feminism and the legalization of abortion, defending since then political positions linked to the right and conservatism. Winter was a candidate for federal deputy for the Democrats in Rio de Janeiro in the 2018 elections, failing to get elected.Elei√ß√µes 2018 ‚Äì Candidatos a deputado federal do Rio de Janeiro. Acessado em October 2, 2018. In 2019, she was coordinator of maternity policies at the Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights of the Bolsonaro government, which she defends. Biography Sara Fernanda Giromini lived with her parents in the city of S√£o Carlos, in the interior of the state of S√£o Paulo. With a history of family violence, Sara said she had experienced various types of abuse, including sexual abuse. She was a prostitute, having worked in prostitution for ten months. =Feminist activism= According to statements given through interviews, Winter said that she joined the feminist movements because she wanted in some way to exterminate all types of Violence against women. At nineteen, to integrate and found a cell of the anti-sex group Femen in Brazil, she traveled to the city of Kiev to receive training and meet one of the group's leaders, Inna Shevchenko. She founded the Brazilian branch of the Fenen under the pseudonym Sara Winter and at the same time became a member of the pro-bisexuality movement \\"Bastardxs\\". Upon returning to the country in 2012, the activist described her ideology as follows: \\"Our ideology is sextremism, a form of opposition to male chauvinism. And nudity has been used by patriarchal society ever since, naked women or not selling all kinds of products. Since we are women, instead of selling products, we sell social ideas. Since everyone likes to look at a woman's body, we use our body to send a message written on the chest, a protest.\\" The group suffered a turnaround with the closing of its Brazilian subsidiary less than a year after its inauguration. In an official statement, the headquarters removed the Winter's right to use the name Femen. In May 2013, Ukrainian Alexandra Shevchenko, one of the founders of Femen, said that Sara \\"is no longer part of our group, we had a lot of problems with her. She is not ready to be a leader\\". The group's founder, Anna Hutsol, also threatened to \\"reveal the real reason why Sara entered Femen\\". In retaliation, Sara made several criticisms of the group, stating that it was a company and a marketing action rather than a legitimate social movement also saying that Brazilian women were never consulted in relation to the group's actions and that \\"they no longer had any desire to be represented by them\\". Former number two of the group, Bruna Themis, also spoke critically towards Femen in an interview, stating that it is a movement without proposals, which excludes women who are outside the standard of beauty considered \\"appropriate\\" and that finds himself distanced from the ideals of feminism and accusing Sara of centralization, authoritarianism and sympathy for Nazism. Bruna's statements echoed on social media, where rumors emerged that Sara belonged to a neo-Nazi group during her youth due to an Iron Cross tattooed on her body. The activist denied participation in such groups, but acknowledged that she maintained contact with neo-Nazis over the internet when she was about 15 years old, and that she really had some ideas similar to those of that movement, but stated that as she grew up she would have realized that it was a \\"thought very wrong\\".http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/1138846-acusada-de-ser-nazista- lider-do-femen-se-diz-ameacada.shtml] Netizens called attention to the fact that her pseudonym \\"Sara Winter\\" would have been an allusion to Sarah Winter, a Nazi-fascist militant in England during World War II ‚Äì what the activist classified as a \\"sad coincidence\\". On the other hand, she openly declares herself an admirer of Pl√≠nio Salgado, founder of the Brazilian far-right party inspired by Italian fascism, known as Brazilian Integralist Action during the 1930s ‚Äì evaluating that said political personality was a \\"defender of the country\\". In December 2013, despite having in her history a protest against social alienation caused by the television program Big Brother Brasil, Sara was a candidate for a place in the 2014 edition of the program. In January 2014, Winter became, moreover, an emblem of homosexual and anti-Christian activism by posing half naked, kissing another activist (Bia Spring), in front of the Church of Our Lady of Candel√°ria, in Rio de Janeiro. =Pro-life activism= In 2014, she completely abandoned any association with any feminist groups she had previously integrated, having even published videos on YouTube where she asked the Christians for forgiveness because of her behavior towards those groups. Soon after, she published a book called \\"No bitch! Seven times I was betrayed by feminism\\", detailing negative experiences she had within the movement in what she accuses them of having pushed her to use drugs, to have unwanted relationships with strangers, so even as the movement claims to fight for women's rights. She then became an activist within an Anti-abortion movement called Pr√≥-Mulher (\\"Pro-Woman\\"). At the same time, she writes and gives lectures alongside a psychologist. As soon as the activist became the mother of a child in October 2015, she revealed that she had already aborted her first pregnancy but that now she would have reformed her positions on abortion, becoming contrary to this practice. She also embraced Roman Catholic Christianity, stating that she intends to raise her son \\"based on the Ten Commandments. The ex-feminist considers that her page on social networks has been more successful since she left the \\"leftist\\" groups, and has sustained herself through lectures and book sales. Additionally, she intends to capitalize on her experience, writing a new book telling the experiences of ex-feminists who left the movement and were persecuted. He also intends to enter the political career, a dream he has had since he was a child. Since then, Sara Winter has been associated with conservative personalities of Brazilian politics, such as Everaldo Dias Pereira, Marco Feliciano and Jair Bolsonaro, with whom she announced a political partnership in 2016 stating that they will fight against a supposed inversion of values in society that would be caused by left-wing social movements such as: feminism, black movement, LGBT movement and gender ideology. During the 2018 presidential elections, Winter called to vote for Jair Bolsonaro. She was a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, by the Democrats of Rio de Janeiro in 2018 but she was not get elected herself. In April 2019, she was appointed national coordinator of maternity policies at the Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights, under the administration of Minister Damares Alves, asking for resignation in November of the same year. In 2020, his trajectory became a documentary: A Vida de Sara produced by Matheus Bazzo and directed by Julia Sondermann. In this film, of marked conservative nature, it is possible to see Winter's metamorphosis until she becomes one of the heroines of the Brazilian extreme right. In April of the same year, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Winter returned to the news by promoting the constitution of a paramilitary group, called \\"Os 300 do Brasil\\", which defends the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro. This group presents itself as a kind of Bolsonaro's praetorian guard, camped in the Pra√ßa dos Tr√™s Poderes and willing to \\"ukraine Brazil\\", that is, to promote a civil war, similar to the one that has faced Ukraine since 2014. Because of that, Winter was expelled from Democrats (DEM) in May 2020. On May 27, 2020, Sara Winter was the target of a search and seizure mandate from the Federal Police in the operation that investigates the Fake News inquiry, a millionaire scheme involving businessmen and bloggers to spread false news and create and maintain false profiles (robots / bots). After having her cell phone and computer seized, Sara recorded a video with threats and curses to STF minister Alexandre de Moraes, who had authorized the operation. The minister forwarded the video to the PGR. In June 2020, she was arrested in connection with an investigation into anti-democratic rallies. Her brother said that he was happy she had been arrested, describing her as \\"a totally out-of-control person\\". In August 2020, Winter leaked confidential information of a 10-year-old rape victim in order to prevent abortion. Brazil allows the intervention of pregnancy in certain cases, such as foetal anencephaly, rape and when the mother's health is at risk. Protestors gathered outside the hospital despite the victim obtaining legal permission for the procedure. This resulted in the victim to be smuggled into the hospital. =Criticism= National and international feminist groups harshly criticized Winter's positions at the head of the group, considering that Sara does not know feminism in depth and defends contradictory flags or that do not make sense for the Brazilian reality. The Ukrainian organization Femen went so far as to say that the Brazilian \\"did not respect the group's ideology\\" and also accused her of lying and \\"doing dishonest things\\", such as not carrying out actions for which she received money from Europe. She also presents herself as a \\"defender of life\\". However, she also defends the liberation of weapons for the entire population and made several publications on her social networks bearing weapons and preaching their use against political rivals.

At the start of WWI, the Katz Drug Stores became famous because they were allowed to stay open past 6pm despite wartime curfews on nonessential businesses. They also absorbed the new 10% tax on cigarettes instead of passing the cost to customers, which was incorporated into their new slogan ‚ÄúKatz pays the tax!‚Äù Katz also sold more than just drugs, each store had a small grocery with a soda fountain and lunch counter and sold small home appliances, records, Katz-branded beer, and even live animals. Katz first location on Main Street Katz Drug Store was one of the first sit-ins during the civil rights movement, occurring on August 19, 1958, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In protest of racial discrimination, black schoolchildren sat at a lunch counter with their teacher demanding food, refusing to leave until they were served. They sought to end the racial segregation of eating places in their city, sparking a sit-in movement in Oklahoma City that lasted for years. This became the start of their low-cost branding, and they quickly grew to 65 stores in 5 states. The stores boasted At their peak they generated over $100 million in annual sales and employed over 3,000 people from different positions like soda jerks to vice presidents. Soon self-service chain stores became more popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so Katz began losing market share. Katz sold itself in 1971 to Skaggs Drug Cos., which eventually merged with Osco Drug, which eventually merged with CVS Pharmacy.

Introduction  The most widely studied among the dynamical reduction (also known as collapse) models is the CSL model. Building on the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber model, the CSL model works as a paradigm of collapse models. In particular, it describes the collapse as occurring continuously in time, in contrast to the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber model. The main features of the model are: * The localization takes place in position, which is the preferred basis. * The model does not alter the dynamics of the microscopic system, while it becomes strong for macroscopic objects: the amplification mechanism ensures this scaling. * It preserves the symmetry properties of identical particles. * It is characterized by two parameters: \\\\lambda and r_C, which are respectively the collapse rate and the correlation length of the model.  Dynamical equation  The CSL dynamical equation for the wavefunction is stochastic and non-linear:\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi_t\\\\rangle=\\\\left[ -\\\\frac i\\\\hbar \\\\hat H\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! t+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}}{m_0}\\\\int \\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! {\\\\bf x}\\\\,\\\\hat N_t({\\\\bf x})\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! W_t({\\\\bf x})\\\\right. \\\\left.-\\\\frac\\\\lambda{2m_0^2}\\\\int\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!{\\\\bf x}\\\\int\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!{\\\\bf y}\\\\,g({\\\\bf x}-{\\\\bf y})\\\\hat N_t({\\\\bf x})\\\\hat N_t({\\\\bf y})\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! t \\\\right]\\\\psi_t\\\\rangle,where \\\\hat H is the Hamiltonian describing the quantum mechanical dynamics, m_0 is a reference mass taken equal to that of a nucleon, g({\\\\bf x}-{\\\\bf y})=e^{-{({\\\\bf x}-{\\\\bf y})^2}/{4r_C^2}}, and the noise field w_t({\\\\bf x})=\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! W_t({\\\\bf x})/\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! t has zero average and correlation equal to \\\\mathbb E[w_t({\\\\bf x}) w_s({\\\\bf y})]=g({\\\\bf x}-{\\\\bf y})\\\\delta(t-s), where \\\\mathbb E [\\\\ \\\\cdot\\\\ ] denotes the stochastic average over the noise. Finally, we introduced\\\\hat N_t({\\\\bf x})=\\\\hat M({\\\\bf x})-\\\\langle\\\\psi_t\\\\hat M({\\\\bf x})\\\\psi_t\\\\rangle,where \\\\hat M({\\\\bf x}) is the mass density operator, which reads \\\\hat M({\\\\bf x})=\\\\sum_j m_j\\\\sum_s\\\\hat a^\\\\dagger_j({\\\\bf x},s)\\\\hat a_j({\\\\bf x},s), where \\\\hat a^\\\\dagger_j({\\\\bf y},s) and \\\\hat a_j({\\\\bf y},s) are, respectively, the second quantized creation and annihilation operators of a particle of type j with spin s at the point {\\\\bf y} of mass m_j. The use of these operators satisfies the conservation of the symmetry properties of identical particles. Moreover, the mass proportionality implements automatically the amplification mechanism. The choice of the form of \\\\hat M({\\\\bf x}) ensures the collapse in the position basis. The action of the CSL model is quantified by the values of the two phenomenological parameters \\\\lambda and r_C. Originally, the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber model proposed \\\\lambda=10^{-17}\\\\,s^{-1} at r_C=10^{-7}\\\\,m, while later Adler considered larger values: \\\\lambda=10^{-8\\\\pm2}\\\\,s^{-1} for r_C=10^{-7}\\\\,m, and \\\\lambda=10^{-6\\\\pm2}\\\\,s^{-1} for r_C=10^{-6}\\\\,m. Eventually, these values have to be bounded by experiments. From the dynamics of the wavefunction one can obtain the corresponding master equation for the statistical operator \\\\hat \\\\rho_t: \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! \\\\hat\\\\rho_t}{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! t} =-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\left[{\\\\hat H},{\\\\hat \\\\rho_t}\\\\right] -\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2m_0^2}\\\\int\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!{\\\\bf x}\\\\int\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!{\\\\bf y}\\\\,g({\\\\bf x}-{\\\\bf y}) \\\\left[{\\\\hat M({\\\\bf x})},\\\\left[{{\\\\hat M({\\\\bf y})},{\\\\hat \\\\rho_t}}\\\\right]\\\\right]. Once the master equation is represented in the position basis, it becomes clear that its direct action is to diagonalize the density matrix in position. For a single point-like particle of mass m, it reads \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\langle{{\\\\bf x}\\\\hat \\\\rho_t{\\\\bf y}}\\\\rangle}{\\\\partial t}=-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\langle{{\\\\bf x}\\\\left[{\\\\hat H},{\\\\hat \\\\rho_t}\\\\right]{\\\\bf y}}\\\\rangle-\\\\lambda\\\\frac{m^2}{m_0^2}\\\\left(1-e^{-\\\\tfrac{({\\\\bf x}-{\\\\bf y})^2}{4r_C^2}}\\\\right)\\\\langle{{\\\\bf x}\\\\hat \\\\rho_t{\\\\bf y}}\\\\rangle, where the off-diagonal terms, which have {\\\\bf x} eq{\\\\bf y}, decay exponentially. Conversely, the diagonal terms, characterized by {\\\\bf x}={\\\\bf y}, are preserved. For a composite system, the single-particle collapse rate \\\\lambda should be replaced with that of the composite system \\\\lambda\\\\frac{m^2}{m_0^2}\\\\to\\\\lambda\\\\frac{r_C^3}{\\\\pi^{3/2}m_0^2}\\\\int\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!{\\\\bf k}\\\\tilde\\\\mu({\\\\bf k})^2e^{-k^2r_C^2}, where \\\\tilde \\\\mu(k) is the Fourier transform of the mass density of the system.  Experimental tests  Contrary to other solutions of the measurement problem, collapse models are experimentally testable. The experiments testing the CSL model can be divided in two classes: interferometric and non-interferometric experiments, which respectively probe direct and indirect effects of the collapse mechanism. = Interferometric experiments = Interferometric experiments can detect the direct action of the collapse, which is to localize the wavefunction in space. They include all experiments where a superposition is generated and, after some time, its interference pattern is probed. The action of CSL is a reduction of the interference contrast, which is quantified by the reduction of the off-diagonal terms of the statistical operator\\\\rho(x,x',t) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\hbar} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+ \\\\infty} \\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! k \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+ \\\\infty} \\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! w\\\\, e^{-ikw/\\\\hbar} F_(k, x-x',t) \\\\rho^(x+w, x'+w, t),where \\\\rho^ denotes the statistical operator described by quantum mechanics, and we defineF_(k,q,t)= \\\\exp\\\\bigg[-\\\\lambda \\\\frac{m^2}{m_0^2} t \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\int_0^t \\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\tau \\\\,e^{-{(q-\\\\frac{k\\\\tau}{m})^2}/{4r_C^2}} \\\\right) \\\\bigg].Experiments testing such a reduction of the interference contrast are carried out with cold-atoms, molecules and entangled diamonds. Similarly, one can also quantify the minimum collapse strength to actually solve the measurement problem at the macroscopic level. Specifically, an estimate can be obtained by requiring that a superposition of a single-layered graphene disk of radius \\\\simeq 10^{-5}m collapses in less than \\\\simeq 10^{-2}s. = Non-interferometric experiments = Non-interferometric experiments consist in CSL tests, which are not based on the preparation of a superposition. They exploit an indirect effect of the collapse, which consists in a Brownian motion induced by the interaction with the collapse noise. The effect of this noise amounts to an effective stochastic force acting on the system, and several experiments can be designed to quantify such a force. They include: * Radiation emission from charged particles. If a particle is electrically charged, the action of the coupling with the collapse noise will induce the emission of radiation. This result is in net contrast with the predictions of quantum mechanics, where no radiation is expected from a free particle. The predicted CSL-induced emission rate at frequency \\\\omega for a particle of charge Q is given by: \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! \\\\Gamma(\\\\omega)}{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! \\\\omega}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar Q^2\\\\lambda}{2\\\\pi^2\\\\epsilon_0c^3m_0^2r_C^2\\\\omega}, where \\\\epsilon_0 is the vacuum dielectric constant and c is the light speed. This prediction of CSL can be tested by analyzing the X-ray emission spectrum from a bulk Germanium test mass. * Heating in bulk materials. A prediction of CSL is the increase of the total energy of a system. For example, the total energy E of a free particle of mass m in three dimensions grows linearly in time according to E(t)=E(0)+\\\\frac{3m\\\\lambda\\\\hbar^{2}}{4m_{0}^{2}r_C^{2}}t, where E(0) is the initial energy of the system. This increase is effectively small; for example, the temperature of a hydrogen atom increases by \\\\simeq 10^{-14} K per year considering the values \\\\lambda=10^{-16} s^{-1} and r_C=10^{-7}m. Although small, such an energy increase can be tested by monitoring cold atoms. and bulk materials, as Bravais lattices, low temperature experiments, neutron stars and planets * Diffusive effects. Another prediction of the CSL model is the increase of the spread in position of center-of-mass of a system. For a free particle, the position spread in one dimension reads \\\\langle{\\\\hat x^2}\\\\rangle_t=\\\\langle{\\\\hat x^2}\\\\rangle_t^{ (QM)}+\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2\\\\eta t^3}{3 m^2}, where \\\\langle{\\\\hat x^2}\\\\rangle_t^{ (QM)} is the free quantum mechanical spread and \\\\eta is the CSL diffusion constant, defined as \\\\eta=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda r_C^3}{2\\\\pi^{3/2}m_0^2}\\\\int\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!{\\\\bf k}\\\\,e^{-{\\\\bf k}^2r_C^2}k_x^2\\\\tilde \\\\mu({\\\\bf k})^2, where the motion is assumed to occur along the x axis; \\\\tilde \\\\mu({\\\\bf k}) is the Fourier transform of the mass density \\\\mu({\\\\bf r}). In experiments, such an increase is limited by the dissipation rate \\\\gamma. Assuming that the experiment is performed at temperature T, a particle of mass m, harmonically trapped at frequency \\\\omega_0, at equilibrium reaches a spread in position given by \\\\langle{\\\\hat x^2}\\\\rangle_{ eq}=\\\\frac{k_B T}{m\\\\omega_0^2}+\\\\frac{ \\\\hbar^2 \\\\eta}{2m^2 \\\\omega_0^2 \\\\gamma }, where k_B is the Boltzmann constant. Several experiments can test such a spread. They range from cold atom free expansion, nano-cantilevers cooled to millikelvin temperatures, gravitational wave detectors, levitated optomechanics, torsion pendula.  Dissipative and colored extensions  The CSL model describes consistently the collapse mechanism as a dynamical process. It has, however, two weak points. * CSL does not conserve the energy of isolated systems. Although this increase is small, it is an at least unpleasant feature also for a phenomenological model. The dissipative extension of the CSL model gives a remedy. One associates to the collapse noise a finite temperature T_{ CSL} at which the system eventually termalizes. Thus, for a free point-like particle of mass m in three dimensions, the energy evolution is described by E(t)=e^{-\\\\beta t}(E(0)-E_{ as})+E_{ as}, where E_{ as}=\\\\tfrac32 k_B T_{ CSL}, \\\\beta=4 \\\\chi \\\\lambda /(1+\\\\chi)^5 and \\\\chi=\\\\hbar^2/(8 m_0 k_B T_{ CSL}r_C^2). Assuming that the CSL noise has a cosmological origin (which is reasonable due to its supposed universality), a plausible value such a temperature is T_{ CSL}=1 K, although only experiments can indicate a definite value. Several interferometric and non-interferometric tests bound the CSL parameter space for different choices of T_{CSL}. * The CSL noise spectrum is white. If one attributes a physical origin to the CSL noise, then its spectrum cannot be white, but colored. In particular, in place of the white noise w_t({\\\\bf x}), whose correlation is proportional to a Dirac delta in time, a non-white noise is considered, which is characterized by a non-trivial temporal correlation function f(t). The effect can be quantified by a rescaling of F_(k,q,t), which becomes F_(k,q,t)=F_(k,q,t) \\\\exp\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\lambda \\\\bar\\\\tau}{2}\\\\left( e^{-(q-k t/m)^2/4r_C^2}-e^{-q^2/4r_C^2} \\\\right) \\\\right], where \\\\bar\\\\tau=\\\\int_0^t\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! s\\\\,f(s). As an example, one can consider an exponentially decaying noise, whose time correlation function can be of the form f(t)=\\\\tfrac12\\\\Omega_{ C}e^{-\\\\Omega_{ C}t}. In such a way, one introduces a frequency cutoff \\\\Omega_{C}, whose inverse describes the time scale of the noise correlations. The parameter \\\\Omega_{ C} works now as the third parameter of the colored CSL model together with \\\\lambda and r_C. Assuming a cosmological origin of the noise, a reasonable guess is \\\\Omega_{ C}=10^{12}\\\\,Hz. As for the dissipative extension, experimental bounds were obtained for different values of \\\\Omega_{ C}: they include interferometric and non-interferometric tests.

The movement to decriminalize psilocybin in the United States began in the late 2010s, with Denver, Colorado, becoming the first city to decriminalize psilocybin in May 2019. The cities of Oakland and Santa Cruz, California, followed suit and decriminalized psilocybin in June 2019 and January 2020, respectively. Supporters of the movement have cited emerging research that indicate potential medical use for the drug. The use, sale, and possession of psilocybin in the United States, despite state laws, is illegal under federal law. Background Psilocybe semilanceata, a psilocybin mushroom species commonly sold in the United States. Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug produced naturally by psilocybin mushrooms, commonly known as \\"magic mushrooms\\". In the United States, it is federally classified as a Schedule I controlled substance that has \\"no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\\" The drug was banned by the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. In February 2019, Troy Farah of Wired reported on two grassroots movements in Oregon and the city of Denver, Colorado, that were pushing for the decriminalization of psilocybin. Advocates for decriminalizing psilocybin have formed their movement based on the rapid legalization of cannabis in the United States. Decriminalization efforts have not included synthetic psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and MDMA. In May 2018, President Donald Trump signed the Right to Try Act, with certain doctors suggesting that it allows terminally-ill patients to use psychedelics for treatment. In October 2018, the Food and Drug Administration granted psilocybin \\"breakthrough therapy\\" status for research. The drug was granted this status again in November 2019. Decriminalization advocates have cited research that suggests that the drug is non-addictive and causes a low amount of emergency visits when compared to other illegal drugs. Other research has indicated the potential beneficial use of psilocybin in treating treatment-resistant depression and nicotine dependence. Advocates have also claimed that decriminalization would lift law enforcement resources to focus on high-priority issues. American author Michael Pollan, writing for The New York Times, criticized the movement for being a premature push while research on psilocybin was not done. He wrote, \\"We still have a lot to learn about the immense power and potential risk of these molecules, not to mention the consequences of unrestricted use.\\" Pollan acknowledged the low-risks of the drug's use, but cited a survey that nearly eight percent of people needed psychiatric treatment after experiencing a bad trip.

The following month, thirty individuals testified to the city council in Oakland, California, about their prior experiences with psilocybin. Following the testimonies, the city council unanimously voted to decriminalize the drug, along with peyote. In January 2020, Santa Cruz, California, voted unanimously to decriminalize the adult possession and cultivation of psilocybin. Commercial sale of psilocybin is still illegal. In September 2020, the City Council of Ann Arbor, Michigan, voted unanimously in favor of a resolution declaring it‚Äôs the city‚Äôs lowest law enforcement priority to investigate and arrest anyone for planting, cultivating, purchasing, transporting, distributing, engaging in practices with or possessing entheogenic plants or plant compounds. Ongoing efforts A 2018 effort to decriminalize psilocybin in California failed to garner enough signatures. In February 2019, Iowa state lawmaker Jeff Shipley introduced two bills that would legalize medical psilocybin and remove the drug from the state's list of controlled substances. In June 2019, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed legislation that would remove restrictions placed on researching the medical use of psilocybin. By November 2019, nearly 100 U.S. cities were reportedly considering measures to decriminalize psilocybin. In January 2020, a Vermont state lawmaker, along with three other co-sponsors, introduced a bill to decriminalize psilocybin, peyote, ayahuasca, and kratom. In February 2020, the Board of Elections in Washington, D.C., decided to allow a vote on decriminalization in November of that year if organizers could collect enough signatures in time. On August 6 2020, after supporters gathered more than 25,000 signatures amid the coronavirus pandemic, the D.C. Board of Elections said the initiative to decriminalize psychedelic plants, including psilocybin mushrooms, will appear on November‚Äôs ballot. On May 26, 2020, an initiative in Oregon to legalize medical psilocybin qualified to appear on the ballot in November. Another initiative in Oregon would decriminalize drug possession and expand treatment services. In May 2020, New York Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal introduced a decriminalization bill, citing ongoing medical research and successful efforts in Denver, Oakland, and Santa Cruz. Public opinion In January 2019, the Oregon Psilocybin Society and research firm DHM Research found that 47 percent of Oregon voters supported the legalization of medical psilocybin, while 46 percent opposed. The percentage of voters in favor increased to 64 percent after key elements of the ballot were clarified to the poll's participants. Beginning of September 2020, according to a survey voters in Washington D.C. support the initiative to decriminalize psychedelic plants and fungi. The number of voters in favor increased nine percentage points since April 2020. A key factor, respondents reported, is that they have learned more about the legislation in question. While 60 percent of participants said they‚Äôll vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù for Initiative 81, 24 percent said they plan to vote ‚Äúno,‚Äù and 16 percent remain undecided. An October 2019 online poll conducted by research firm Green Horizons found that 38 percent of U.S. adults supported legalizing psilocybin \\"under at least some circumstances.\\" References Category:Drug policy of the United States Category:Psychoactive fungi ","title":"Psilocybin decriminalization in the United States"},{"id":"64099929","text":"Literature in Bhutan dates back to 1950s. It is rich and full of folklore, but due to lack of reading culture, it is growing very slowly as compared to other contemporary literatures. New writers are more and more engaged in writing short stories and poems. In Bhutan, eighteen different languages are spoken; and of those only Dzongkha has a native literary tradition. The other literary languages, Nepali and Lepcha, have not featured in Bhutan's own literature. In Western Bhutan the predominant language is Dzongkha, in the east it is Tshangla and along the southern belt it is Nepali. Several other important regional languages also exist. Dzongkha is a descendent of Ch√∂ke (Classical Tibetan), which was the language of education in Bhutan until the early 1960's. Nepali literature More than 90% of Bhutanese people used Nepali as a common language before 1960. In 1962, Bhutan started to publish Kuensel (first national newspaper) from Madi printing press of Kalimpong, India, and Nepali literature in Bhutan had an opportunity to broaden its area. In those days, Nepali articles written by the writers from, primarily, Kalimpong and Darjeeling used to be published in Kunsel.

He left an important body of graphic work, and his works continued to be published after his death.  Biography  He was born in Marseille, though his family came originally from Avignon. At the age of 15 he entered the √âcole des beaux-arts, Marseille, to study under Joanny Rave (1827‚Äì1887). Accepted by the √âcole des beaux-arts, Paris, he was taught by Alexandre Cabanel and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. In 1896 his discovery of F√©licien Rops immediately influenced his style of engraving and themes. He became friends with Alfons Mucha, who introduced him to the lithographic poster. Back in Marseille, his first exhibitions were greeted by critics with praise for his talent both in etching and in painting. Among other things, he produced a series of engravings entitled Guerro (1893-1895), variations around the theme of death, of great graphic intensity, inspired by Francisco Goya. He then became friends with members of the F√©librige, a literary and cultural association dedicated to promoting the Occitan language of Provence, and composed his first poems in the Marseilles dialect, and then a work of fition in which he showed all his sensitivity and his compassion for the humble and marginalized. He was elected majoral of the F√©librige in 1894, then Capouli√© (chief) from 1909 to 1919. He proved to be in favour of a revival of the Occitan language in all its linguistic varieties, and composed, in a language which he developed to unify the Occitan and Catalan tongues, first Lugar, conte magic, and then La Legenda d'Esclarmonda which was published a few months before his death at the age of 76. From 1930 to his death he was president of the Soci√©t√© d'√©tudes occitanes. On 22 March 1903 he was elected to the Acad√©mie de Marseille.

Producers, semi-fabricators, consumers, recyclers, and merchants can use Nickel futures contracts to hedge Nickel price risks and to reference prices. As of December 31, 2019, LME Nickel is associated with 153,318 tonnes of physical Nickel stored in 500 LME approved warehouses around the world. This is 5.67% of the 2019 global estimated mined Nickel production of 2.7 million tonnes. Despite the low share of physical Nickel associated with LME Nickel contracts, global physical Nickel transactions are usually based on LME Nickel prices. This practice began in the 1970s to 1982, when producer Nickel prices, especially Canadian producer prices collapsed, and the industry switched to LME prices. Development of LME Nickel prices as benchmark prices From World War One to the late 1970s, world Nickel prices were set by producer price lists. Three main suppliers, INCO, Falconbridge, and Soci√©t√© Le Nickel produced around 75% of world Nickel demand and controlled pricing. The producers began to lose pricing power in the 1970s due to three factors. First, technological development of AOD processes and Laterite ore processing led to the development of many new Nickel producers. Second, a 1969 strike in Canada, and subsequent strikes, led to Nickel shortages and price spikes, which caused many consumers to lose faith in producer list pricing. Third, market participants started to realize that producer list pricing worked only when demand is high and producers stocks were low; when demand weakened producers were forced to discount from official producer list prices to secure orders. Producer price lists were becoming less relevant throughout the 1970s and physical Nickel trades gradually adopted LME Nickel prices as benchmark prices thereafter. Contract description LME Nickel contracts trade on the London Metal Exchange, which introduced them in 1979. The contracts require physical delivery of the asset for settlement, and deliverable assets for the contracts are 6 tonnes of Nickel of 99.80% purity (minimum) conforming to B39-79 (2008). The contracts prices are quoted in US dollars per tonne, but can also be settled or cleared in Japanese Yen, UK Sterling, and the Euro. LME Nickel prices have minimum tick sizes of $5.00 per tonne (or $30.00 for one contract) for open outcry trading in the LME Ring and electronic trading on LMEselect, while minimum tick sizes are reduced for inter-office telephone trading to $0.01 per tonne (or $0.50 for one contract). Carry trades involving Nickel futures also have reduced minimum tick sizes at $0.01 per tonne. Contracts are organized along LME's prompt date (or delivery date) structure. =Prompt date structure= LME offers three groups of LME Nickel contracts with daily, weekly, and monthly delivery dates. Contracts with daily settlement dates are available from two days to three months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with daily delivery dates for 2020-05-14, 2020-05-18, 2020-05-19 ... 2020-08-10, 2020-08-11, and 2020-08-12 are available for trading. Contracts with weekly settlement dates are available from three months to six months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with weekly delivery dates for 2020-08-12, 2020-08-19, 2020-08-26 ... 2020-11-12, 2020-11-18, and 2020-11-25 are available for trading. Contracts with monthly settlement dates are available from six months to 63 months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with monthly delivery dates for 2020-05-20, 2020-06-17, 2020-07-15, ... 2025-06-19, 2025-07-17, and 2025-08-21 are available for trading. Non- commercial Uses LME Nickel futures contract prices serves as a platform for Nickel price discovery because futures markets are more publicly visible and more accessible, due to lower transaction costs, for a larger number of buyers and sellers than the cash market. A larger number of buyers and sellers in the futures market allows those market participants to incorporate more demand and supply information into the futures price compared with the cash price. Empirical tests have shown that LME Nickel spot and futures markets are closely linked, although sometimes the spot market serves as a source of price discovery for the LME Nickel futures market rather than the reverse. LME Nickel contracts with delivery dates up to 63 months into the future are available, and prices of those contracts can produce forecasts of the spot price of Nickel at those delivery times. However, LME Nickel price forecasts of spot Nickel prices were found to exhibit biases. LME Nickel futures prices are also a part of both the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the S&P; GSCI commodity index, which are benchmark indices widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in these commodity indices give LME Nickel prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios. Related derivatives LME also offers other derivatives related to LME Nickel futures contracts, such as Options, TAPOs, Monthly Average Futures, LMEminis, and TAS contracts. The Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) offers Nickel futures contracts for trading as well, SHFE contracts are for 1 metric tonnes of Nickel Cathode as prescribed in the National Standard of GB/T 6516-2010 Ni9996, with the total content of nickel and cobalt > 99.96%. SHFE Nickel contract rices are quoted in Yuan per tonne. Financial market conventions and empirical studies have grouped Nickel futures contracts with other base metals futures contracts together as an asset class or a sub-asset class. The Base Metals grouping usually includes futures contracts on Aluminium (sometimes including Aluminium Alloy contracts), Copper, Lead, Nickel, Tin, and Zinc, and they are also sometimes called Industrial Metals, Non-ferrous Metals, and Non-precious Metals. All of the metals in this group have associated LME contracts available for trading. Pricing factors Warehouse stock levels, or amounts, movement, and distribution of physical Nickel stored in both LME approved and non-approved warehouses, affects LME Nickel pricing. Nickel stocks in LME approved warehouses are relatively transparent, while Nickel stocks at non-LME approved warehouses can be hidden or difficult to interpret. Relatively low warehouse stocks can signal lack of supply or extra demand for Nickel and drive up Nickel prices. While low warehouse stocks can can signal abundant supply or low demand for Nickel and drive down prices. Nickel warehouse stocks in regions that historically consume high levels of Nickel matter more in supply and demand terms than stocks in regions that historically consume low levels of Nickel, and thus have higher impact on Nickel pricing. LME warehouses are chosen worldwide to be close to sources demand rather than supply, ensuring that the buyer has immediate access to metals they purcahsed on the LME. However, China does not allow warehouses in its territory to become LME-registered, and metal for Chinese delivery is typically shipped from Singapore or South Korea. Inventory figures across all warehouses are published daily by the LME.

Early life L√ºtfiye Sultan was born on 20 March 1910 in the Dolmabah√ße Palace. Her father was ≈ûehzade Mehmed Ziyaeddin, and her mother was Perizad Hanƒ±m. She was the sixth child, and fifth daughter born to her father and the second child of her mother. She had one full-sister, Hayriye Sultan two years older than her. She was the granddaughter of Sultan Mehmed V and Kamures Kadƒ±n. According to her Palace teacher, Safiye √ún√ºvar, she was a beautiful blond haired girl like her sister and mother. She and her sister started their education in 1915, by the consent of their grandfather. Their first lessons were learning the Quran and then continue other studies. They recited the Quran in a Recitation Ceremony arranged by their grandfather in the Lesser Chancellery of the palace, along with them a girl named Nesrin also recited Quran in the ceremony. Later, during the last years of her grandfather's reign, her parents and her sister and teacher settled in a villa located in Haydarpasha. Following the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, L√ºtfiye and her family settled in Alexandria, Egypt. Marriage L√ºtfiye Sultan married Hasan Kemal Bey on 3 June 1932 in Alexandria, Egypt. A year after the marriage on 7 May 1933 she gave birth to the couple's first child a son, Sultanzade Ahmed Re≈üid Bey, who died at the age of twenty five in 1958. A year later on 7 May 1934, she gave birth to the couple's second child, another son, Sultanzade Re≈üad Bey,he died at the age of seventy-nine in January 2014. The couple's third child and only daughter Perizad Hanƒ±msultan was born on 11 January 1936. The couple later settled in Maadi, Cairo. L√ºtfiye's husband was referred to among the Ottoman royals as Damat Kemal denoting his membership in that ethereal cast of Imperial grooms. The couple owned a large handsome villa on Road 10. The villa had been the wartime scene of a historic wedding when her younger sister, Mihrimah Sultan, married Prince Nayef bin Abdullah of Transjordan.

Cash Box listed the single as one of their \\"feature picks\\" during June 1987 and commented: \\"It is a tougher, more sinewy effort than his other solo singles, hearkening back to his Babys' days.\\" Larry Seel, writing for the Orlando Sentinel, commented: \\"The song has a rocking little melody that's bound to implant itself somewhere in your brain\\". He considered the song's music video to be \\"full of pep\\" and \\"reminiscent\\" of Rod Stewart's \\"Some Guys Have All the Luck\\".

The church promised a cutting, taken from some of the yews in its churchyards that are more than 2,000 years old, to any parish that wanted one. It expected to distribute a few hundred but by the end of 2000 had distributed 8,000. The project helped raise awareness of environmental issues within the church and provided a large collection of yew trees of known provenance.  Background  The millennium yew project started in November 1996 as a collaboration between the Church of England and the Conservation Foundation, UK to provide yew cuttings for parishes to plant to commemorate the end of the 2nd millennium. Yews in Britain can live for millennia and the country has the largest collection of ancient yews of any in the world. The majority of surviving yews in Britain that are more than 2,000 years old are in Church of England churchyards where they have been protected from development. The project planned to take cuttings from twenty ancient yews and provide them to any parish that wanted one. The idea being that the new cuttings would take provenance from trees that had been alive at the birth of Christ. The project was overseen by the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC) as part of its \\"Sacred Land\\" project.  Cuttings  The initial project was run by David Bellamy, David Shreeve and Libby Simon and it was expected that a few hundred cuttings would be needed. The uptake was much bigger than expected and the project soon expanded with a \\"last-minute\\" operation to gather the necessary cuttings. Botanist Fergus Kinmonth led a collection team that used climbers to take cuttings at high level from some sixty yews. The cuttings, around in height, were packed in newspaper and transported in picnic boxes by motorcycle courier to a nursery in Bedford where they were grown on in greenhouses. The young plants were distributed throughout 2000 in a series of 40 special services held across the country, many in cathedrals. Graham Preskett composed \\"The Yew Tree Hymn\\" for the occasion and the supermarket Waitrose provided specially designed carrier bags to transport the cuttings. The Royal Mail issued a commemorative stamp to celebrate the project, as part of its 2000 \\"Tree and Leaf\\" series. During one service at St Paul's Cathedral some 136 yew cuttings were distributed at a ceremony attended by 1,000 people. Costs prohibited the sending of a lorry to Truro so private cars were used instead to transport smaller cuttings. One bishop said \\"This has been amazing‚Äîso many people who would not normally have come to a service in my cathedral‚Äîbut they have come for a tree\\". As a result of the project some 8,000 yews were planted in 7,000 Church of England parishes. Those planted included trees at Lambeth Palace, home of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the National Memorial Arboretum. Often dignitaries were invited to ceremonially plant the trees and these included bishops, vicars, celebrities and members of the Royal Family.  Impact  Shreeve said in 1996 that the tree would become \\"symbols of community and signs of creation\\". Some of the trees flourished, by 2019 at least one was in height. Others fared worse, one of those distributed in the St Paul's service was planted at St George's church, Malaga but died in the drier Spanish climate. ARC estimated that one in twenty of the trees will survive into the fourth millennium. The yews provide a significant collection of trees of known provenance, which will be valuable in research in future years. ARC describes the project as one of the most successful to come out of the British millennium celebrations. Shreeve states that it helped to raise awareness of environmental projects in the church and led to the creation of more environmental officers in diocese teams. A survey was launched in 2019 for parishes to record the condition of their yew trees as part of the 20th anniversary of the project.

The company specialized in the design and manufacture of fibreglass sailboats. The company was founded by Ted Gozzard in 1970 and continued in business until a plant fire forced its closure in 1988. All of the company's boat designs were optimized for cruising and included more headroom below decks than competitors. The company occupied a unique marketing niche, building boats with traditional sailing ship design features, such as long keels, clipper bows, trailboards and bowsprits, all rendered in modern materials. History Bayfield 25 The first Ted Gozzard design produced was the Bayfield 23 in 1973, which evolved into the successful Bayfield 25 two years later. The Bayfield 25 was described by reviewer Michael McGoldrick as, \\"a true pocket cruising sailboat\\" and became known for its miniature traditional ship looks. The Bayfield 30/32 was also introduced in 1973 and was a faster boat than the other designs. The largest boat produced was the Bayfield 40 introduced in 1982, which used an unconventional cabin layout.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 378. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Ted Gozzard left the company in 1981 to found a new company, Gozzard Yachts, based in nearby Goderich, Ontario and his younger brother, Haydn Gozzard, took over running Bayfield Boat Yard, including designing its final boat, the Bayfield 36. The cutter rigged 36 retained the original styling of Ted Gozzard's earlier designs. The Bayfield factory outgrew its original location and moved to Clinton, Ontario, ultimately employing 65 people people there. In 1988 a fire destroyed the plant and the business closed. A Bayfield dealer, Neptune Marine, along with some new partners, bought the Bayfield hull moulds and attempted to re-establish the business, but the effort did not succeed and went bankrupt after a few years. In a June 1987 review of the Bayfield 36 in Canadian Yachting, writer Sven Donaldson, described the Bayfield line aesthetic, \\"prior to the 36, all the Bayfields except the ketch-rigged 40 have suffered from simply appearing too small. Their highly cambered cabins are overwhelmed by the curvaceous lines of the hulls. Although the 40 (45 feet overall) is to my eye the best-looking Bayfield model, the 36 is long enough to make the style work. By raising the sheerline amidships, compared to earlier Bayfields, designer Hayden Gozzard was able to lower the cabin profile to a small, but significant extent. The wine-glass stern is nicely drawn, and in my estimation is among the most attractive features of the boat.\\"  Boats  Bayfield 32 Summary of boats built by Bayfield Boat Yard: *Bayfield 23 - 1973 *Bayfield 30/32 - 1973 *Bayfield 25 - 1975 *Bayfield 29 - 1978 *Bayfield 40 - 1982 *Bayfield 36 - 1984 See also *List of sailboat designers and manufacturers ReferencesExternal links Category:Defunct sailboat manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1970 Category:1988 disestablishments in Ontario Category:1970 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Bayfield Boat Yard"},{"id":"64100295","text":"Karlo Bauman (2 February 1914 - 6 July 1954) was a Croatian sailor.

Constructed in the mid 1990s as part of the Jubilee Line Extension, the site is the main depot for stabling and maintaining the line's 1996 Stock trains, although some trains are stabled at Neasden Depot.  History  Stratford Langthorne Abbey, a Cistercian monastic abbey was founded in 1135 on the site. The abbey survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. In 1879, the Great Eastern Railway opened a new wholesale fruit and vegetable market at Stratford to rival Spitalfields Market. This market gave its name to the local Stratford Market train station. After 112 years, the wholesale market closed on 13 May 1991, moving to New Spitalfields Market in Leyton. The market buildings were demolished in 1992 to make way for the Jubilee line depot. = Construction of the depot = The Jubilee Line Extension project required the construction of a new depot to serve the extended Jubilee line, given the increased number of trains could not be accommodated at the existing Neasden Depot site. The site at Stratford Market was chosen instead of sites at Stratford TMD, Thornton Fields and the Greenwich Peninsula, as the land was mostly available with few commercial and industrial occupiers. To commemorate the former use of the site as a fruit and vegetable market, the new facility was named Stratford Market Depot. Construction began in April 1994, with archaeological excavations uncovering evidence of Stratford Langthorne Abbey, as well as 674 graves. These were reburied at the modern Cistercian Abbey of Mount St Bernard Abbey in Leicestershire. The depot fully opened in March 1998, prior to completion of the extension \\\\- allowing for testing and commissioning of the new 1996 Stock trains, as well as the testing of the new extension itself. = Jubilee line depot = Designed by Chris Wilkinson Architects, the main depot building is parallelogram shaped, and features a wide by long arched roof that covers 11 maintenance roads. Outside, the depot has 33 stabling roads, with the layout of the 11 hectare site designed to mitigate archaeological impacts to the Stratford Langthorne Abbey. The main depot building was awarded a Civic Trust Award in 1998. As well as the Jubilee line depot, a large training centre for London Underground is located at the site.

His funeral took place on June 6. * An officer of TPD, whose identity is being protected under a controversial application of Florida law, who was placed on administrative leave following the incident, which is common practice with officer involved shootings in the United States.  Background  In 2020, McDade entered into a relationship with Jennifer Jackson, a neighbor of his who was the mother of Malik Jackson. According to her family members, McDade entered Jackson's home on May 25 and pistol-whipped her. On May 26, McDade returned to Jackson's home and allegedly became verbally abusive. This led to a physical altercation with Malik Jackson and other members of Jackson's family. Early on May 27, McDade went live on Facebook to recount being jumped by a group of men, which had been a one-on-one fight before an insult caused four others to join, and vowed revenge. McDade stated he had weapons and planned to fight one of the men; He detailed his wounds from the altercation which included a bloody elbow and two lumps on his head. He potentially alludes to an attempted suicide by cop or gun fight with the man;  Incident  According to the Tallahassee Police Department they approached McDade on May 27, as a suspect in the fatal stabbing of Malik Jackson earlier in the day. The Department Police Chief Lawrence Revelle told reporters that; \\"the suspect was in possession of a handgun, and a bloody knife was found at the scene\\" and that McDade had pointed a gun at the responding officer. The officer reported this information over the department's radio frequency. Witnesses have disputed this, claiming that officers said \\"Stop moving, n--r\\" and then shot McDade after he stopped moving. The witnesses also claim that officers never identified themselves or told McDade initially to stop his actions.  Investigations On May 27, investigations were launched into the stabbing incident, and the officer involved in the subsequent shooting. The officer has been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation. On September 3, a Leon County grand jury found that the police use of force against McDade was justified.https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/09/04/grand-jury-tony- mcdade-mychael-johnson-findings-tallahassee-police-department- shootings/5709205002/ Shortly afterward, the City of Tallahassee released video from a police body camera showing McDade pointing a firearm at one of the police officers before being shot.https://www.tallahassee.com/videos/news/2020/09/05/police-bodycam- footage-tony-mcdade-selfie-video-show-lead-up-aftermath-shooting/5723527002/  Reactions  Separate vigils took place for both victims on May 28. McDade's was organized by the Tallahassee Community Action Committee, to draw attention to the three police-related deaths (McDade, Wilbon Cleveland Woodard, and Mychael Johnson), since Lawrence Revell assumed the office of Chief of Police in December 2019. On May 27, a petition was created to publicize the case, and for McDade to be recognised as a transgender man in reports and official statements. On May 29, Tori Cooper of the LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said \\"LGBTQ people of color are at greater risk for violence every day in this country. This must end. Our hearts are heavy as we mourn with Tony's family and friends.\\" Over 100 LGBTQ Organizations included McDade in a list of recent transgender killings. A GoFundMe.com campaign raised over $190,000 for McDade's family in its first week. Journalist Alexander Kacala expressed concern that McDade's shooting had received insufficient attention from the Black Lives Matter movement writing, \\"Throughout the protests, the stories, Black trans people who were victims of police violence, like Tony McDade, got lost in the larger conversation around Black Lives Matter.\\"  References  Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:2020 in Florida Category:African-American history of Florida Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Tallahassee, Florida Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Violence against trans men Category:Law enforcement controversies in the United States Category:Deaths by firearm in Florida Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:May 2020 events in the United States Category:2020 deaths Category:Black people shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:History of racism in Florida Category:Law enforcement in Florida ","title":"Shooting of Tony McDade"},{"id":"64100378","text":"Vladimir Markotic (July 16, 1920 - November, 1994) was a Croatian American anthropologist, archaeologist and cryptozoologist. Biography Markotic was born in Banja Luka.\\"Dr. Vladimir Markotic fonds\\". University of Calgary. He emigrated to the United States in 1947. He obtained his M.A. Anthropology from Indiana University (1955) and a PhD in Anthropology from Harvard University (1963). He was a research assistant at Indiana University and a teaching assistant for the Institute of East European Studies. Markotic was a Fellow of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University and a Fellow of the American Anthropological Association. In 1962, he became Assistant Professor of Archaeology at Illinois State University and from 1969 was Associate Professor of Archaeology at University of Calgary. He retired as Associate Professor Emeritus in 1986. He was a specialist in Old World Archaeology and took interest in the ethnology and linguistics pertaining to Bosnia and Croatia. Markotic died in Calgary, aged 74. Cryptozoology Markotic took interest in bigfoot and was a researcher in the field of cryptozoology, which has been criticized as pseudoscience. In 1984, he contributed a chapter to the book The Sasquatch and Other Unknown Hominoids, which he also edited with Grover Krantz. The book consists of 21 papers by a multitude of authors. It was negatively reviewed by Michael R. Dennett in the Skeptical Inquirer. Dennett commented that \\"The Sasquatch and Other Unknown Hominoids is bad science and, taken as a whole, bad writing... Until some real evidence comes to light there is no reason for anyone to take Sasquatch promoters seriously, especially if this book represents their best effort.\\" Anthropologist Kathleen J. Reichs wrote that the book failed to provide a scientifically rigour analysis of the physical evidence for unknown hominoids and is \\"riddled throughout with typographical and grammatical errors.\\" She concluded that the book is unsatisfying from the point of view of physical anthropology but is worth reading for providing insight into non-mainstream interpretations of hominid evolution. Biologist Debra A. Oleksiak commented that apart from a few exceptions \\"there is no critical evaluation of the sources and the accuracy of the data\\" and noted that many of the papers in the book \\"do not reflect an understanding of biological processes or evolutionary thinking\\".

Traditions  Regimental Nouba = The band at a Victory in Europe Day ceremony in Strasbourg, 8 May 2013. The regimental military band of the regiment is known as the \\"Nouba\\". The traditional uniform is generally derived from those in use in the 19th century. The earliest evidence of music in these African regiments dates back to the centenary of Algeria in 1860, and the painter Edouard Detaille in 1884 represented the nouba of the 2nd Infantry. The band, which is a small size ensemble, has had a turkish crescent used for ceremonial dutues since the end of the First World War. = Mascot = Around 1930, some regiments most often had a mascot, a bighorn sheep or a ram. The mascot of the 1st Regiment is called Messaoud, which in Arabic means \\"fortune\\". = Uniform = Bastille Day festivities in Strasbourg. A characteristic of La Nouba is its oriental dress, which recalls the uniform of the old Algerian tirailleurs created around 1840. The origin of these troops goes back to the Arab and Turkish units formed by the French after the Invasion of Algiers in 1830, with volunteers, contingents provided by different local chiefs, or with organized troops from the various beys defeated by the French. This uniform consists of baggy pants called \\"saroual\\", which sky blue or white depending on the season, tightened at the waist by a wide red woolen belt. Its function was to keep the abdomen of soldiers and non-commissioned officers warm to prevent them from suffering from intestinal ailments. The short, blue jacket, with yellow facings drawing beautiful scrolls, is worn over a sleeveless vest: the \\"sedria\\". On the head, the skirmishers wear the \\"ch√®che\\", that is to say a strip of white rolled up fabric, or the \\"ch√©chia\\" in crimson felt with a pompom with sky blue fringes. Only this regiment is authorized to wear the golden half-moon on a clear sky- blue background, crowned with three chevrons of the African arm.

The term additionally finds mention among Western sources, mainly in the colonial-era literature of British India. Historically, the term \\"Afghan\\" was also synonymous with the Pathans. The Pathans originate from the Pashtunistan region straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan. There are varying estimates of the population of Pathan descent living in India, ranging from 3.2 million people per the All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind to around 10 million. Khan Mohammad Atif, an academic at the University of Lucknow, estimates that the total population of Pathans in India may be \\"twice their population in Afghanistan\\". In the 2011 Census of India, 21,677 individuals reported Pashto as their mother tongue. Large-scale Pashtun migration into India began in the 11th and 12th centuries, as a result of the many Muslim empires and dynasties founded by Pashtuns on the Indian subcontinent. Pashtuns also arrived as traders, officers, administrators, diplomats, travelers, religious saints and preachers, students, and as soldiers serving in the armies of India's rulers. In many cases, migration and settlement occurred amongst whole clans. Today, the Pathans are a collection of diversely scattered communities present across the length and breadth of India, with the largest populations principally settled in the plains of northern and central India. Following the partition of India in 1947, many of them migrated to Pakistan. The majority of Indian Pathans are Urdu-speaking communities, who have assimilated into the local society over the course of generations. Pathans have influenced and contributed to various fields in India, particularly politics, the entertainment industry and sporting sector. History The Pathans of India are a community who trace their ancestry to the Pashtun regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Pashtun homeland is located in Central Asia and the northwestern region of South Asia; it roughly stretches from areas south of the Amu River in Afghanistan to west of the Indus River in Pakistan, mainly consisting of southwestern, eastern and some northern and western districts of Afghanistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan in western Pakistan, with the Durand Line acting as the border between the two countries. The Hindu Kush mountains straddle the north of the region. Geographically, the Pathans are an eastern Iranic ethnic group who lived west of the Indo-Aryan ethnicities of the northern Indian subcontinent. Some Pashtuns from the Ghilji tribe historically used to seasonally migrate to India in winter as nomadic merchants. They would buy goods there, and transport these by camel caravan in summer for sale or barter in Afghanistan. Demographics The Pathans of India descend from different tribes and clans. Some of the common Pashtun tribes found in India include the Afridis, Ahmadzais, Durranis, Kakars, Khattaks, Lodis, Orakzais, Shiranis and Yusufzais. =Hindu Pathans= Prithviraj Kapoor in the 1951 film Awaara. The actor, of Punjabi descent, identified as a Hindu Pathan and spoke Pashto. The term \\"Hindu Pathan\\" is often used as self-identification by some Indian Hindus who hailed from or were born in the predominately Pashtun regions of British India (now Pakistan), as well as those who arrived from Afghanistan. The 1947 partition of India led to an exodus of Hindus settled in the former North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan, which are part of modern Pakistan, into the newly independent India. Notable people from these regions, mainly Peshawar, who identified as Hindu Pathans include the Punjabi-origin independence activist Bhagat Ram Talwar and union minister Mehr Chand Khanna; Prithviraj Kapoor, the progenitor of Bollywood's Kapoor family (along with his sons Raj, Shammi and Shashi Kapoor), also of Punjabi descent; his cousin, Surinder Kapoor (father of Anil Kapoor); actor Vinod Khanna, and film producer F.C. Mehra (father of Umesh Mehra). Pushpa Kumari Bagai writes that the Hindu Pathans in India, especially those who migrated from the Derawali-speaking area of Dera Ismail Khan, had their own unique vegetarian cuisine. In her historical magnum opus River of Fire, writer Qurratulain Hyder makes reference to Hindu Pathans from the NWFP who were displaced by the partition and settled in India. Some Hindus who lived in Balochistan prior to 1947, and later migrated to India following the partition, had a highly Pashtunized culture and spoke a form of Pashto or Balochi. They identified themselves culturally as Pathans and members of the Kakari tribe. Originating from Quetta and Loralai, they brought their customs and practices with themselves to India, where they became known as the Sheenkhalai (Pashto for \\"the blue skinned\\"). This name stemmed from a novel tradition their womenfolk practiced, who would adorn their faces, hands and skin with permanent tattoos to enhance their appearance. These decorative, tribal tattoos were considered a form of art and beauty in their culture, however they were looked down upon by other Indians. The women wore a traditional hand-embroidered dress known as the kakrai kameez, similar to a firaq ‚Äì the upper garment worn by Pashtun females. They also listened to Pashto music and would teach the language to their children. Due to their different culture and appearance, they were often stereotyped and considered Muslims or foreigners by the locals. The Sheenkhalai, numbering up to 500 at the time of partition, settled mostly in Rajasthan (in Uniara, Jaipur and Chittorgarh) and Punjab, and adopted Indian culture. In recent years, there have been efforts to revive their indigenous culture. In 2018, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai met members of this community and inaugurated the Sheenkhalai Art Project during the Jaipur Literature Festival. A feature-length documentary titled Sheenkhalai ‚Äì The Blue Skin produced by Shilpi Batra Adwani, a third-generation Sheenkhalai herself, explores the history and origins of this community and was funded by the India‚ÄìAfghanistan Foundation. From the 1950s and onwards, some Pakistani Hindus from Peshawar and surrounding areas moved to India, settling chiefly in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Firozpur, as well as in Delhi, Rajasthan and other places across India. As of 2005, they numbered over 3,000 families including both Hindus and Sikhs. Amritsar itself was home to over 500 Peshawari families, and most of them lived in an area known as the Peshawari Mohalla where they had set up a Hindu temple for the community. They were mainly businesspeople. According to the Hindustan Times, around 250 Hindu and Sikh families were living in an area named \\"Mini Peshawar\\" near Chheharta in Amritsar as of 2016. Although Peshawar was not as violently affected by communal riots as other regions during the partition, the Peshawari Hindus cited economic issues, security challenges and religious violence as reasons for their emigration after independence. A wave of similar migrations continued in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. After living in India for some time, these Hindus are able to secure Indian citizenship. The elderly Peshawari Hindus are distinguishable due to their Peshawari clothing and the Peshawari turban which some of them wear, and they converse in Pashto or the local Peshawari dialect. However, the younger generation is not fluent in these languages. Since the 1970s, thousands of Afghan Hindus have also settled in India while escaping war and persecution. Many of them had lived in the Pashtun areas for generations, spoke Pashto, and practiced a culture that was Pashtun-influenced. =Diaspora= A secondary diaspora of Pathans from India also exists, including those who were transported from British India to various other colonies as indentured workers in the early 19th century. DistributionNorth India= In July 1954, over 100,000 Pashtun tribespeople living in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir were granted Indian nationality. They are a mostly endogamous, Pashto-speaking community whose ancestors migrated from what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan prior to India's independence. The village of Gotli Bagh in Ganderbal district is home to around 10,000 Pashtuns. The community observes Pashtun customs such as jirga for mediation on disputes, and Pashto television channels like Khyber TV are followed to keep up to date with news in the region. They mostly marry within their community, which has allowed their language and culture to be preserved intact. The city of Malerkotla is home to a significant population of Punjabi Muslims, some of whom are of Pathan origin. It is notably the only Muslim-majority city in Indian Punjab, since the partition in 1947. The princely Malerkotla State was established and ruled by a Pathan dynasty of Sherwani and Lodi origins. The Pathans in Malerkotla were considered an influential group and were principally landowners. Their numbers dwindled after many of them migrated to Pakistan. They are principally divided into the Yusufzai, Lodi, Kakar and Sherwani tribes. The rulers of the state historically shared a harmonious relationship with their Hindu and Sikh subjects, giving them protection and equal rights as minorities, which is one of the reasons why the city was mostly spared from violence during the partition. Even after independence, members of the royal Pathan family have continued to receive political support in state elections. Chandigarh is a common destination for Afghan students who pursue tertiary education in India. They numbered up to 500 as of 2019, and were enrolled in different institutes including Panjab University. The princely Pataudi State, which was founded by the Pataudi family and ruled by the Nawab of Pataudi, was centred in Pataudi in modern Haryana's Gurgaon district. The Pataudis were of Afghan descent, whose ancestors arrived in India in the late 15th century as mercenaries of the Pashtun emperor Bahlul Lodi, during the latter's reign. According to Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, the family are \\"basically Afghans with a bit of Turkish blood.\\" There is a small community of Pashto-speaking Hindus and Sikhs who migrated from Parachinar (in Pakistan's Kurram District) to Himachal Pradesh in 1948. They have an organisation known as the Akhil Bharatiya Parachinar Biradari, which seeks to gain Scheduled Tribal status for the community in order to secure various government incentives and opportunities committed under the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes for \\"displaced\\" communities. They are settled in a village also named \\"Parachinar\\" in Bharmour in Chamba district. These Parachinaris are noted for their Pathan dresses and turbans, their traditional Chitrali-influenced dance known as the gharra, and the Pashto dialect which they speak. According to Sohail Hashmi, the Peshawari dress and turban were a common site on the streets of Delhi up until the 1960s. The area of Jangpura has long been a hub for Pathan Muslims, possibly due to its proximity to the Nizamuddin Dargah. Across North India, the Pathan population is chiefly spread over 74 districts. Beginning in the 17th century, tens of thousands of \\"Rohilla\\" Pashtuns migrated into modern Uttar Pradesh and settled in what became known as the Rohilkhand region. =Central IndiaWestern India= Pathans are noted as one of the Muslim castes living in Diu, which is part of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Pathans are noted as one of the many Muslim communities in the state of Goa. They use the surname Khan, while the women may use Khatun, Khatu or Bibi. It has been noted that they freely marry outside their community. Mumbai has been home to a Pathan community since the 19th century, mostly originating from the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan. Afghanistan has maintained a consulate-general in Bombay since 1915, alluding to the historic presence of Afghans and Pathans in the city. The Afghan-born Karim Lala was one of the three most influential dons in the Mumbai underworld for decades. As the head of the \\"Pathan Gang\\", a mafia group comprising mostly ethnic Pathans involved in various types of organised crime, Karim Lala wielded significant political clout and was well known to both the elite and common man of Mumbai. =East India= There are Pathan families present in the city of Ranchi. Odisha was historically one of the territories conquered by Pathans, most notably under Khwaja Usman. The Bengal region was historically one of the territories ruled by Pathan dynasties in India. The Karrani dynasty, the last of the dynasties to hold the Bengal Sultanate, was of Pashtun origin. The city of Kolkata has been home to a large Afghan and Pathan community for generations, where they are known by the term Kabuliwala (\\"people of Kabul\\") and have historically constituted an integral part of the city's cultural fabric. The term is derived from the iconic and much-romanticised short story of the same name written by Rabindranath Tagore in 1892, which essays the tale of an Afghan merchant who journeys all the way to Kolkata and sells dry fruit. Once numbering over 10,000 in 2001, their population has reduced to no more than 2,000 to 5,000 as of 2015. Many of them were famous for working as traditional moneylenders, an industry which declined following the introduction of microfinance. =South India= During the British Raj in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Pashtun prisoners were amongst those who were transported \\"across the water\\" to the penal colony on the Andaman Islands for incarceration. One such incarceree who was serving life imprisonment on the island, Sher Ali Afridi, became known as the assassin of Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India, while the latter was visiting the settlement in 1872. According to Kumar Suresh Singh, in the state of Karnataka, the Pathans are \\"distributed in all districts.\\" According to S. N. Sadasivan, the Travancore region was home to a group of Pathan Muslims who were descendants of sepoys employed by the maharajas of Travancore. Susan Bayly notes that the 18th- century Travancorean maharajas actively recruited Pathan soldiers to train and lead their armies, as did many other South Indian kingdoms, who were keen to bolster their military capacities with the experiences of such men. The former Hyderabad State had a Pathan community, and also an organisation known as the Pakhtoon Jirga which looked after the interests of the Pashtuns living within that state. =Northeast India= There are some Afghan businessmen who have been living in Assam for several decades. They are also known as Kabuliwalas. Rajkumar Jhalajit Singh in A Short History of Manipur mentions Pathans as one of the communities among the Manipuri Muslims. In Sikkim, the Muslims are categorised into two main social classes: the ashraf (aristocracy) and ajlaf (commoners). The former usually includes people of \\"Sayyad, Shaikh, Mughal and Pathan ethnic backgrounds.\\" Culture In India, the Muslim surname Khan is largely synonymous with and commonly used by Pathans as per Pashtun naming conventions, although not all Khans are necessarily of Pathan descent. The female equivalent used by Pathan women is Khanum or Bibi. In the caste system present among medieval Indian Muslim society, the Pathans (historically also known as ethnic 'Afghans') were classified as one of the ashraf castes ‚Äì those who claimed descent from foreign immigrants, and who claimed the status of nobility by virtue of conquests and Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent. The earlier generations of Indian Pathans spoke their native language Pashto, while some still adhere to the traditional code and Pashtun way of life known as Pashtunwali. The Pashtun empires in India historically used the Dari Persian language. As a result of cultural assimilation with Indians over the course of several centuries, most Pathans in India lost the ability to speak Pashto and instead adopted Hindustani or other local dialects. =Cuisine= Pathan cuisine is known for its high emphasis on meat-based dishes. Typically, meat is either: boiled or roasted; marinated and barbecued in the form of tikka pieces placed on skewers in a grill; formed into different types of kebabs; cooked in large quantities in curries with mild spices; or prepared in a clay pot (e.g. handi gosht) ‚Äì and eaten by hand with bread (e.g. Peshawari naan or roti), which is baked on a tandoor oven. Usually, the meat is kept intact and allowed to cook in its own fat. The chapli kebab, which originated in Peshawar, is a popular snack in Indian cities. Afghan immigrants in India have popularised other unique Afghan foods, such as the Afghani burger, Afghani naan, mantu dumplings, and Kabuli pulao. Afghan and Pathan recipes rely less on spices, and tend to be flavoured with salt, garlic, pepper, raisins, pinenuts, walnuts, and various dried or fresh fruits. Lajpat Nagar in Delhi is a hub of Pathan cuisines due to its sizable Afghan population. Tandoori chicken was popularised in India by Kundan Lal Gujral, a Punjabi Hindu-\\"Pathan\\" chef from Peshawar who moved to Delhi in 1947 and founded the Moti Mahal Delux chain of restaurants. Due to the Peshawari influences on Gujral's cooking, it is often regarded as a Punjabi-Pathan dish. Kundal Lal also invented the iconic butter chicken and dal makhani. Education Each year, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations grants 2,325 scholarships to international students, with six-hundred and seventy-five spots being reserved especially for Afghans. In India, an increasing number of native students are learning Pashto at academic institutions such as the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Entertainment industry Soha Ali Khan, an actress belonging to the Pataudi family. =Cinema= The city of Peshawar in the North-West Frontier Province gave birth to several prominent actors in the Hindi film industry, Bollywood. Some Indian actors also have ancestry in Balochistan and Afghanistan. The Qissa Khwani Bazaar area of Peshawar is the location of the ancestral homes of the Kapoor family, Dilip Kumar and Shah Rukh Khan. Notably, the Hindko-origin Dilip Kumar (born Yusuf Khan) and Shah Rukh Khan, or the Punjabi-origin Hindu Pathans like the Kapoor family, while not ethnically Pathans, are often referred to as \\"Pathans\\" due to their culture and origins in Peshawar. Actor Naseeruddin Shah, along with his sons Imaad, Vivaan and nephew Mohommed Ali, belong to the family of the 19th-century Afghan warlord Jan-Fishan Khan, who was born in Paghman of Saiyid descent, and moved to India in the 1850s where he became the first Nawab of Sardhana. Most of the Khans of Bollywood, however, belong to the Pathan community, including the Peshawar- born actor Jayant (born Zakaria Khan) and his son Amjad Khan; Kader Khan, who belonged to the Kakar tribe with parents from Kandahar and Pishin; the Tanoli- origin siblings Feroz, Sanjay and Akbar Khan, whose father settled in Bangalore from Ghazni, and their descendants Fardeen and Zayed Khan; the renowned screenwriter Salim Khan and his sons Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail Khan (see Salim Khan family), whose Alakozai or Akazai ancestors migrated to Indore from the Swat region; the director-cum-producer siblings Nasir and Tahir Hussain ‚Äì the former being the father of Mansoor Khan and maternal grandfather of Imran Khan, and the latter known as the father of Aamir, Faisal and Nikhat Khan ‚Äì along with their nephew Tariq Khan, whose Pathan ancestors hailed from Herat; Saif Ali Khan, along with his sister Soha Ali Khan and daughter Sara Ali Khan, who, of royal Pataudi lineage, have relatives in Pakistan and ancestors that migrated from Afghanistan; and Irrfan Khan. Actress Madhubala, who is sometimes called the \\"Marilyn Monroe of Bollywood,\\" was a Yusufzai Pathan. There have also been other Pathan film directors, producers and scriptwriters, such as Zia Sarhadi; Farah and Sajid Khan, who have Pathan ancestry from Peshawar; and in recent times, Kabir Khan. Adnan Sami, a pop singer and composer, while performing. =Music= Pathans have contributed to Indian music as well; the sarod, a stringed instrument used in Hindustani classical music, descends from the Pashtun rubab and was invented by the Bangash musical gharana which migrated to India (whose descendants include ustads Sakhawat Hussain, Hafiz Ali Khan, and the latter's son Amjad Ali Khan). G. M. Durrani was a noted Bollywood playback singer, music director and radio artist during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. In pop music, the Pakistani-origin Adnan Sami has been called the \\"reigning King of Indipop.\\" =In popular culture= Pathan characters have been portrayed in many Bollywood films, creating a subgenre of what are known as \\"Pathan movies\\". The 1947 theatrical play Pathan was produced by Prithviraj Kapoor's Prithvi Theatre, and was commercially successful across India. Prithviraj played the lead role while his sons Raj, Shammi and Shashi also acted. Kabuliwala (1961), in which Balraj Sahni essays the role of the protagonist, has been called the \\"mother of all Pathan movies\\". It is based on the short story of the same name written by Rabindranath Tagore in 1892, featuring the story of a wandering Afghan merchant in Bengal in pre-partition India. Earlier, a Bengali film based on this story was released in 1957. It is believed that the famous Pathan character of Sher Khan, which was scripted by Salim‚ÄìJaved and portrayed by Pran in Zanjeer (1973), was based on the Mumbai mafia don Karim Lala. The song Yaari Hai Imaan Mera, Yaar Meri Zindagi (\\"friendship is my faith, the friend is my life\\") from that movie features an influence of the Pashtun instrument rubab, and is danced to by men in the attan style. In 2013, a remake of the film was released in Hindi and Telugu simultaneously, in which Sanjay Dutt and Sri Hari reprised the role of Sher Khan, respectively. They featured in a qawwali-style Pathan dance number, Khochey Pathan Ki Zubaan. The action film Qurbani (1980), in which a police officer named Amjad Khan (played by Amjad Khan himself) chases two fugitives (played by Feroz Khan and Vinod Khanna), featured a song Qurbani Qurbani which was set in a \\"Pathan's den\\". In the song, the three protagonists donned Pathan getup. Khuda Gawah (1992) stars Amitabh Bachchan as an Afghan tribesman who settles accounts with his enemies after finding himself trapped in an Indian prison, and was partially shot in Afghanistan. Literature and media Urdu poetry in India developed under the influence of Pathans, in addition to various other communities belonging to the Perso-Arabic sphere of influence. One such prominent poet was Josh Malihabadi, an Afridi Pathan. His cousin, Abdur Razzaq Malihabadi, was also a writer. =Pashto in India= Pashto literature thrived in North India from the early 16th century up until the turn of the 19th century, even while Persian remained the dominant language of the region during the Mughal period. It was a provincial language spoken mainly by Pashtun administrative and military elites, and other Pashtun settlers and temporary dwellers in India. Extant manuscripts have provided evidence of Pashto verses and poetry emerging from the Ganges region. Pir Roshan, a Sufi who is regarded as one of the earliest Pashto writers, was a Pashtun from Waziristan who was born in Jalandhar. He inspired the Roshani movement which, during the late 16th and 17th centuries, gave rise to prominent Pashto poets and writers in the Indian subcontinent. The area forming modern-day Uttar Pradesh was among the few regions in India where Pashto literature continuously developed; Pashtun litterateurs from the Rohilla community produced works in the language up until the late 18th century. The All India Radio (AIR) operates a Pashto- language service. Pashto was the first external radio service of AIR, broadcasting its inaugural transmission on 1 October 1939 for Pashto-listeners across British India's North-West Frontier Province and Afghanistan. Its purpose was to counter German radio propanda infiltrating Afghanistan, Iran and West Asian nations following the outbreak of World War II. The Centre of Persian and Central Asian Studies (CPCAS) at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University offers bachelor-level degrees in Pashto. The language is also used by Afghan Pashtun expatriates living in India. Zakir Husain, India's third president, on a 1998 postage stamp. Military In British colonial India, the Pathans were classified as one of the \\"martial races\\" and enlisted in large numbers into the British Indian Army. The 40th Pathans, which later became part of the Pakistan Army, remained for some time the only all-Pathan regiment in British India. From 1897 to 1908, the number of Pathan servicemen in the British Indian Army arose from 2,500 to 10,500. Around a quarter were Afridis, and a large number were drawn from the tribal areas forming British India's northwestern frontier with Afghanistan. They comprised, in total, 67 companies across 43 regiments. By the time of World War I, their numbers had increased to 28,000. Politics Abdul Ghaffar Khan was a Pashtun nationalist and close friend of Mahatma Gandhi who, as leader of the Congress-allied Khudai Khidmatgar, was one of the prominent members of the Indian independence movement against British rule before the partition. After 1947, he became a Pakistani citizen. Zakir Husain, an Afridi Pathan, was an economist and politician who served as the third president of India from 1967 to 1969. Prior to that, he was the second vice president of India, and also served as the governor of Bihar. His maternal grandson Salman Khurshid served as India's minister for minority affairs, law and justice, and external affairs in successive terms. Mohammad Yunus was a career diplomat who served as India's ambassador in various countries, and also became a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha in 1989. Sport Irfan Pathan, while bowling in the nets. Pathans have represented the Indian national cricket team both before and after independence. They include Jahangir Khan, a Burki Pathan who played for India between 1932 and 1936, later becoming a cricket administrator in Pakistan. Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi, the eighth Nawab of Pataudi, played for both England and India in the 1930s and 1940s, eventually captaining the Indian side in 1946. His son, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, also played Test cricket as a batsman for India between 1961 and 1975 and became the country's youngest captain when appointed in 1962. The all-rounder Salim Durani (who in official cricketing records is referred to as the first Afghan-born Test cricketer, but was born near the Khyber Pass) represented India in Test cricket in the 1960s and 1970s. The brother duo of Yusuf and Irfan Pathan have together represented India at the national level across all formats. In field hockey, Feroze Khan was a gold medalist for India at the 1928 Summer Olympics. He was a Pathan from Jalandhar, and migrated to Pakistan in the early 1950s. Ahmed Khan became a gold medalist for India at the 1936 Summer Olympics, while his son Aslam Sher Khan was a member of the Indian squad which won the 1975 Men's Hockey World Cup. They were Pathans from Bhopal. In squash, Abdul Bari was one of India's leading players in the 1940s and represented the country at the 1950 British Open. Yusuf Khan was a ten-time all-India champion who later migrated to Seattle, United States, and turned to coaching several professional players; his daughters Shabana and Latasha Khan represented the US.

In 1914, she established the first twilight-sleep maternity hospital on Bay State Road in Boston, Massachusetts. In an article written by the New York Times in 1915, Ransom recommended that it should be required by federal law that anyone who administers scopolamine should only be able to do so with a special license or course of instruction. Ransom was a member of multiple medical societies throughout her life, including the Copley Society, Canadian Club of Boston, Boston University Women's Graduate Club, and Massachusetts Homeopathic Medical Society, by whom she was elected president in 1902. She also wrote many articles in medical journals on the subjects of mental and nervous diseases and of childbirth, including an article for the Washington Post on November 9, 1926 that summarizes the conditions face in a home birth as a plead to provide more precise scientific information for a home that is expecting a child. Ransom was also an active worker in the woman suffrage movement and a strong supporter of coeducation.

The season is a part of the 2020 Western United States wildfires. By September, wildfires had burned over 713,000 acres, 181 homes had been lost, and one death occurred as a result. The 2020 fire season saw more individual fires than in any other recorded year. Predictions and preparation Based on environmental factors and forest conditions, the Washington‚ÄìOregon wildfires were projected to be the worst in the United States during 2020. Firefighting was expected to be complicated by personnel and resource shortages, and lack of training, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington. By mid-May, one Washington State Department of Natural Resources firefighter had tested positive for the novel coronavirus and officials weren't sure how to get crews across quarantine boundaries and into Washington. Experts said another effect may be that plans to fight fires would be scaled back and many 2020 fires would be left to burn. Department of Natural Resources training began June 19 outside Hamilton, Washington in Skagit County. According to the Skagit Valley Herald, interagency training in Washington that usually involves federal, state and local firefighting agencies was canceled due to COVID-19 concerns.

It originally released at Annecy in June 2019. The film was added to the list of Best Animated Short Film for 2019 for a vote, and was in 9th place, but it wasn't nominated. Plot Porky Pig and Daffy Duck are riding on an elephant through the jungle. Porky tells the audience that he and Daffy are in search of the Lost Temple of Monkeybird so that they can trade the treasure inside for a reward and pay off their parking tickets in town. However, the trail to the temple disperses before their very eyes, prompting the pair to think they are lost; this is proven wrong as the temple was actually right in front of them all along. Before they enter the temple, they are told by a skull to \\"Beware the Monkeybird curse\\". Porky is instantly frightened by the warning, but Daffy, believing that science will prevail, decides to ignore it and go on ahead, before a troupe of bats and ghosts force him to persuade Porky to take the lead. Inside, Porky says to be wary of any booby traps that may lay ahead. Daffy is adamant towards this as he sets off the many traps which brutally injure Porky. Daffy finds Porky and tells him that they have found the Treasure of the Monkeybird Temple. Unfortunately, as they rush towards it, they discover that the ground is littered with banana skins and \\"Monkeybird Monthly Magazines\\" before Daffy is immediately bitten in the leg by a snake, forcing him to plead Porky to suck out the venom. It turns out that Daffy has already captured the treasure, and the leg actually belongs to the dreaded Monkeybird. Porky and Daffy try to escape with the treasure on a vine, but the Monkeybird blocks their passage by revealIng that he can actually fly, and are eventually cornered by the creature. Daffy tries to communicate with the monster, which the Monkeybird happily mistakes for a marriage proposal, instantly preparing the ceremony with Porky as the bridesmaid. To the Monkeybird's confusion, Daffy leaves him at the altar by putting him in his own wedding ring before leaving with Porky for town on an airplane fashioned from the treasure chest. Crash landing back home, they open the chest to behold a valuable golden egg inside. To their chagrin, they discover that the treasure is actually the dozens of offspring of the Monkeybird, after which Porky dourly remarks to as the curse they were warned about.

Early life and education  Born in Italy, Lo Schiavo grew up in Sydney, with one younger brother (Dario, a prominent fencer) and two sisters (one of whom, Lydia, became a teacher at Newcastle Technical High School), as well as an aunt and her three children. According to Dario, his father was a titled aristocrat with little money, who migrated to Australia in the late 1890s and operated a shop in Market Street, Sydney. According to Lydia, the family had been landowners on the island of Salina near Sicily, and their grandfather had been a governor of the Lipari Islands before migrating to Australia. His mother was a teacher at the Sapienza University of Rome, and migrated to Australia in the early 1900s. The family were devoutly Catholic, and at the mother's insistence, all the children learned Italian or French; according to his brother, Vergil spoke five languages. Lo Schiavo's father owned blocks of apartments in the Eastern Suburbs, and was financially ruined when the Great Depression hit, and Premier Jack Lang announced a moratorium on rent. After a stroke, Lo Schiavo's father went back to Rome in 1930 or 1931 in search of a cure, but passed away in 1942. The family were living in Yurong St, East Sydney, since before 1918, when it was a down-at-heel suburb and a man was killed by a razor gang in the laneway next to the house. They moved to Victoria Street in Potts Point around 1924. His family hosted many prominent members of the arts community at their house, including the actors Peter Finch and Chips Rafferty, and the illustrator Unk White. Finch lived with the Lo Schiavo family for six months, during which time they taught him to fence, and he was a model for Lo Schiavo for two paintings executed for St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, of St Stephen and St Sebastian. Lo Schiavo attended the University of Sydney, where he was an active member of the community, graduating with a BA in 1932. Already a promising artist, his vignettes of the University were well received in the Sydney Mail. In connection with a Commemoration Day student riot in 1929, he was convicted of riotous conduct and suspended for the University for perceived disrespect at the Cenotaph in Martin Place. After his studies in Sydney, in June 1933 Lo Schiavo went to Rome and Florence and obtained Diplomas of Arts cum laude in 1934 from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma, (the first Australian to do so) and in 1935 from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze. He returned from Italy in the company of his sister Lydia in 1935, and gave his positive impressions of Italy under Mussolini in the Sydney Giornale Italiano and the Sydney Morning Herald. He had earlier written an essay in Il Giornale Italiano in praise of fascism in 1933. In was in Italy that he learned to fence, and he later became a NSW champion (winning both foil and sabre in 1937) and taught his brother Dario, who founded the Sydney University Fencing Club.  Career  Lo Schiavo taught at both the Dattilo-Rubbo Art School in Sydney and at East Sydney Technical College. He had a studio on Wylde Street in Potts Point. In 1937 he opened an art school at 122 Harrington Street. Lo Schiavo was mainly known as a muralist, executing works in Australia, India, and Italy. In 1933 during his education in Rome, he completed a mural of the Apotheosis of St Laurence in the Chiesa di San Lorenzo Martire in his native Malfa. During World War II, he contracted rheumatic fever in India and was left with little energy to complete his murals. In 1939 he departed for then Bombay, where he painted 27 murals in (then) the New Ritz Hotel. His work Sleeping Bombay Coolies was a finalist for the Sulman Prize in 1944. Lo Schiavo produced a number of sacred murals in Australia. He executed murals for the Cathedral of St Stephen in Brisbane, commissioned by Archbishop James Duhig during World War II but now painted out, as well as a canvas The Martyrdom of St Stephen, 'the biggest of its kind ever undertaken in Australia‚Äô, according to the archbishop. He also executed a 1938 mural in Christ Church St Laurence in Sydney. He also took on commercial clients. He installed an allegorical mural in the Collins Street offices of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Melbourne. He executed two murals in Newcastle;, including one in the Commonwealth Bank. The mural inside the former Rural Bank building, depicting Newcastle in about 1824, is unaccounted for after renovations to the building in 1984. Lo Schiavo contributed several major murals at the University of Sydney and its colleges. He designed the mosaics for the chapel in Freehill Memorial Tower at St John's College. In the University, Lo Schiavo is most famous for his three murals in the Holme Building at the University of Sydney Union: in the upper galleries of the building, the Sulman-Prize-winning mural Tribute to Shakespeare (1945)., and the Sulman-Prize finalist mural Characters from Dickens (1951). In the main hall of the Refectory is his monumental Mankind (1970). The artist told the Sydney Morning Herald, \\"the student [at the centre of the mural] is holding a book, but whether it is Karl Marx or the Bible, I am not saying.\\" He painted this final mural free of charge, with the Union only bearing costs for scaffolding. Not long after completing Mankind, Lo Schiavo returned to Rome, where he passed away aged 61 in September 1971.

It is the eighth-highest peak in the Methow Mountains, and ranks 95th in the state of Washington. Switchback Peak is set on Sawtooth Ridge, on land managed by the Okanogan- Wenatchee National Forest. Other peaks of Sawtooth Ridge include Oval Peak, Star Peak, Hoodoo Peak, Courtney Peak, Mount Bigelow, and Martin Peak, which is the nearest higher neighbor, to the north. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Switchback Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Switchback Peak can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Precipitation runoff on the west side of the mountain drains into Lake Chelan via Prince Creek, whereas the east side of the mountain drains into tributaries of the Methow River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

This includes his family and friends, politicians and other political organizations, the police, and other institutions and businesses. There have been many varied international responses as well.  Family and friends  Terrence Floyd, George's brother, visits the location where he was killed on June 1 Floyd's cousin, Tera Brown, said police \\"were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn't see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life\\". One of Floyd's brothers said: \\"They could have tased him; they could have maced him. Instead, they put their knee in his neck and just sat on him and then carried on. They treated him worse than they treat animals.\\" Floyd's brother, Philonese, called for peace and said, \\"Everybody has a lot of pain right now, that's why this is happening, I'm tired of seeing black people dying.\\" Floyd's longtime friend, former professional basketball player Stephen Jackson, expressed anger and sadness, saying video of Floyd's death \\"just destroyed me\\". Floyd's girlfriend, Courtney Ross, asked for the community to respond to his death in a way that honors him: \\"You can't fight fire with fire. Everything just burns, and I've seen it all daypeople hate, they're hating, they're hating, they're mad. And he would not want that.\\" Selwyn Jones, the brother of Floyd's mother, said that what disturbed him most was \\"hearing him on video call for my sister\\".  Political  Minneapolis and Minnesota = Minneapolis city councillor Andrea Jenkins, who represented Ward 8, where Floyd's death occurred, was quoted as saying: \\"My heart is breaking for the tragic loss of life last night near 38th and Chicago. Our community continues to be traumatized again, and again and again. We must demand answers.\\" On May 26, Minnesota governor Tim Walz and lieutenant governor Peggy Flanagan demanded justice and called the video \\"disturbing\\". Walz elaborated, \\"The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening. We will get answers and seek justice\\". Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said: \\"Being black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man's neck ... When you hear someone calling for help, you're supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense.\\" Two days after Floyd's death he commented: \\"If most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they'd already be behind bars.\\" He has said that he believes Floyd's death was a murder. U.S. representative Ilhan Omar (whose district includes Minneapolis) called for a federal investigation and said: \\"It is sickening to watch this black man be killed while helplessly begging for help.\\" She later added: \\"The police officer who killed George Floyd should be charged with murder.\\" Senator Tina Smith and Governor Tim Walz also called for immediate action. Senator Amy Klobuchar reacted on the following day, saying: \\"We heard his repeated calls for help. We heard him say over and over again that he could not breathe. And now we have seen yet another horrifying and gut wrenching instance of an African American man dying.\\" She called for the declaration on \\"a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable.\\" However, as a former Hennepin County attorney, she was criticized for declining to press criminal charges against police during her eight years in that office, including against Chauvin; some called for her resignation from the Senate. At a June 7 rally, nine of the Minneapolis City Council's thirteen members pledged to disband the city's police department, though significant reductions in police staffing may require amending the city's charter and Frey has expressed opposition to it. On June 12 the council unanimously adopted a resolution to begin a year-long project to develop \\"strategies for building [a] new model for cultivating community safety\\". After the City Council banned police chokeholds, Walz called for similar reforms in other communities, called the Minnesota legislature into a special session on police reform and economic equality and proposed a police reform package. On June 26, 2020, the Minneapolis City Council approved a proposed charter amendment to alter the Minneapolis Police Department. The proposed amendment was drafted by council members Jeremiah Ellison, Alondra Cano, Cam Gordon, Steve Fletcher and council President Lisa Bender. Despite previous pledges by city council members to \\"end\\" the Minneapolis Police Department, Star Tribune reporter Liz Navratil afterwards revealed that the proposed amendment, which allows the continuation of \\"licensed officers,\\" would not fulfill this objective if approved by voters, but would only rename the Minneapolis Police Department and change its structure. = Federal = President Donald Trump sent his condolences on May 28 via Twitter, saying he requested that the FBI conduct a thorough investigation. He added, \\"My heart goes out to George's family and friends. Justice will be served!\\" Trump also described Floyd's death as \\"sad and tragic\\". On May 29, President Trump denounced rioting, violence and looting occurring during nationwide protests, tweeting: \\"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\\" On June 1, in response to continued protests, President Trump threatened to deploy the military by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. U.S. Ambassadors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and China expressed concern and condemned the killing. On June 13, the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, put up a large Black Lives Matter banner to show \\"our support for the fight against racial injustice and police brutality as we strive to be a more inclusive & just society.‚Äù Proposals were made in the House by the Congressional Black Caucus and in the Senate by Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate's only black Republican, to address police reforms. The Senate bill failed to advance to the House. The House bill was passed June 25 with support from three House Republicans. = Former U.S. presidents = All living former United States presidents released statements. *On May 29, Barack Obama published a lengthy statement through Twitter calling for a \\"new normal\\" that ends the legacy of \\"bigotry and unequal treatment\\". On June 3 he said that the United States \\"was founded on protest: it is called the American Revolution, and every step of progress in this country, every expansion of freedom, every expression of our deepest ideals has been won through efforts that made the status quo uncomfortable.\\" *On May 30, Bill Clinton released a statement via the Clinton Foundation saying: \\"In the days since George Floyd's death, it is impossible not to feel grief for his family ‚Äî and anger, revulsion, and frustration that his death is the latest in a long line of tragedy and injustice, and a painful reminder that a person's race still determines how they will be treated in nearly every aspect of American life.\\" *On June 2, George W. Bush and former First Lady, Laura Bush, issued a 500-word statement which read in part that they are \\"anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country\\", and that \\"It is time for America to examine our tragic failures.\\" The statement continued, saying: \\"Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means.\\" *On June 3, Jimmy Carter and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter also released a statement, which read in part: \\"People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say ‚Äòno more' to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy.\\"  Police  State = The union representing Minneapolis police pledged \\"full support to the involved officers... Now is not the time to rush to judgement and immediately condemn our officers.\\" After union president Bob Kroll called Floyd a \\"violent criminal\\" and protesters \\"terrorists\\", the Minnesota AFL‚ÄìCIO and the Minneapolis branch of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees called for him to resign. The Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association endorsed the firing of the officers involved. = National = Police across the country were sharply critical of Chauvin's actions. Leaders from organizations which include hundreds of thousands of police officers condemned the four officers' conduct. National Association of Police Organizations Executive Director William Johnson called the incident egregious, and said: \\"I don't know the entire story, but I can't see any legal justification, any self-defense justification, or any moral justification.\\" Fraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes said authorities must ensure justice is served in Floyd's death, \\"whatever the consequences\\". Police chief associations from across the country expressed dismay at Floyd's treatment. The heads of both the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) condemned what was seen on the video. The MCCA, led by Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, said: \\"The death of Mr. Floyd is deeply disturbing and should be of concern to all Americans. The officer's actions are inconsistent with the training and protocols of our profession and MCCA commends Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo for his swift and decisive action to terminate the employment of the officers involved.\\" The National Police Foundation President said: \\"These actions, and inaction, jeopardize the gains that have been made through the sacrifices and courage of many.\\" Leaders of individual police departments from around the United States spoke out against the officer at the center of the video, with what The Washington Post called \\"disgust\\", and the Los Angeles Times called \\"blunt criticism\\". The Los Angeles Times said: \\"It was a rare moment when police leaders were unequivocal in their public disdain for the conduct of one of their own.\\" Leaders condemning the officer's actions included the New York City Police Commissioner, the Sheriffs of Los Angeles and San Diego counties, and the Police Chiefs of Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, Houston, and Austin, as well as a former Police Chief from Seattle. Police chiefs of smaller cities spoke out as well: Chiefs of Police from Buffalo Grove, Illinois; Tucson, Arizona; Round Rock, Texas; the University of Texas at Austin; Pflugerville, Texas; and Omaha, Nebraska; all issued statements against Floyd's treatment. Numerous experts on law enforcement technique and training severely criticized the use of the choke hold maneuver known as a \\"neck restraint\\" in general, and in Floyd's case in particular. The neck restraint was used in Minneapolis 237 times in the last 5 years but was banned in the wake of the Floyd death. A deputy sheriff in Jones County, Mississippi was fired for posting on social media: \\"If he can scream he can breathe, something else was going on.\\" Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had the words BLACK LIVES MATTER painted on a street immediately in front of the White House. The New York State Legislature voted to make police disciplinary records public.  Institutions  Soon after Floyd's killing, a number of institutions and organizations announced that they would be limiting or cutting ties with the Minneapolis Police Department, and no longer hiring its officers for event security. These included the University of Minnesota, the Minneapolis School Board, the Walker Art Center and the Minneapolis Institute of Art. The United States Marine Corps, United States Navy and the US Army general in charge of U.S. Forces Korea have banned public display of the Confederate flag in their facilities. National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell issued an apology \\"for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.\\" The United States Soccer Federation repealed a 2017 rule requiring players to stand during the national anthem. The Boy Scouts of America condemned the killings of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor; made a new Diversity/Inclusion merit badge a requirement for the rank of Eagle Scout; and promised a \\"review of property names, events and insignia... to build on and enhance the organization's nearly 30-year ban on use of the Confederate flag\\".  Businesses  Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben's, Cream of Wheat, Mrs. Butterworth, Eskimo Pie, Redskins and Chicos have announced that they will retire their brand images or names based on racial stereotypes. Target and Best Buy made Juneteenth a company holiday.  International Countries= *Canada: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that racism was real and existed in both the United States and Canada. He then urged Canadians to stand up against it. *China: The Foreign Ministry of China denounced the killing of George Floyd with the statement: \\"The death of George Floyd reflects the severity of racial discrimination and police brutality in the US\\", and urged the US to \\"eliminate racial discrimination and protect the lawful rights of minorities\\". State media ran significant coverage of the events, with the goal of highlighting what Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian called a \\"double standard\\" compared to US denunciations of police brutality in the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. *Germany: Chancellor Angela Merkel described the police operation as murder saying: \\"this murder of George Floyd is something very, very terrible\\". *Iran: Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, retweeted a tweet saying people with dark skin faced being killed \\"in the next few minutes\\" if they walked out on American streets. Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi called on the US to \\"stop oppression and aggressive conducts against its people and let them breathe\\". *Ireland: Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that there is an \\"absence of moral leadership\\" in the US following the death of George Floyd. *Peru: Peruvian President Mart√≠n Vizcarra expressed that the killing of Floyd is \\"a sign of racism and discrimination\\" that must be rejected. He said that according to what was answered in the last national census, most Peruvians felt discriminated at some time in their lives. Finally, he congratulated the Afro-Peruvian community on the Day of Afro- Peruvian Culture. *Russia: The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the United States had a history of systematic human rights abuses. *Scotland: The Scottish Parliament voted to end exports of rubber bullets, tear gas, and riot gear to the United States. *South Africa: The African National Congress, the governing party in South Africa, released a statement calling for calm in the U.S., which was criticized for not mentioning similar deaths due to police action in South Africa. *Turkey: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan blamed Floyd's death on a \\"racist and fascist approach\\" by the United States and said Turkey will be monitoring the issue, while extending condolences to his family and loved ones. *United Kingdom: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that \\"racist violence has no place in our society\\", and that he was \\"appalled and sickened\\" by the footage. He also urged people to \\"protest peacefully and in accordance with the rules on social distancing\\". *Venezuela: Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro accused President Trump of using the U.S. military against his own people and claimed that demonstrators are taking to the streets demanding an end to racism and police violence. =International organizations= *African Union: African Union officials, including Moussa Faki Mahamat, criticized the killing. U.S. embassies in Africa also condemned the incident, in a move that was described by the media as unusual. *European Union: Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc is \\"shocked and appalled\\" by the death of black American George Floyd in police custody, calling it \\"an abuse of power\\" and warning against further excessive use of force. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it \\"strongly condemned the appalling death of George Floyd\\" as well as other similar killings throughout the world. The parliament also condemned \\"white supremacism in all its forms\\", and called on the American government to address its racist practices. *United Nations: Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, condemned the incident as one of many killings of unarmed African Americans, and called on the United States to take \\"serious action\\" and end the repeat of such killings. She also urged protestors to \\"express their demands for justice peacefully\\" and for police to refrain from further use of excessive force. On June 5, a group of 66 UN experts called the death of George Floyd as modern-day \\"racial terror\\" lynching in the US. \\"African Americans continue to experience racial terror in state-sponsored and privately organized violence ... In the US, this legacy of racial terror remains evident in modern-day policing\\", the group of experts quoted. =Religious leaders= * The Dalai Lama, in India while teaching students, condemned the killing of George Floyd by saying, \\"there are some who even take it as a pride to be able to kill somebody\\". * Pope Francis addressed Floyd's death during his weekly prayer at the Vatican on June 3: \\"Dear brothers and sisters in the United States, I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd.\\" He added: \\"We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life.\\" * The Holy Synod of Bishops of the Orthodox Church in America issued a statement on May 31 condemning the killing of George Floyd: \\"We categorically reject racism in any form.

She was rumoured to have survived and held captive by local Mapuches; her supposed plight caused a stir and was even the subject of two paintings by Raymond Monvoisin. She was born in Valdivia, Chile, the daughter of Miguel Bravo Aldunate and Carmen Jaramillo Jaramillo. She married Juan Ba√±ados Berendique on 12 October 1846. The shipwreck In the winter of 1849, the Spanish brig Joven Daniel was sailing on the Pacific coast of Chile from Valpara√≠so to Valdivia. Several passengers were on board, including trader Don Ramon Ba√±ados, his wife Dona Elisa Bravo and a baby a few months old. The ship capsized on the coast near the Imperial River and was completely wrecked; none or only a few passengers and crew survived. According to one version of the events a short distance inland, the survivors found an indigenous settlement and, despite their trepidation, were welcomed by the cacique (chief) and promised protection. They responded by salvaging whatever they could from the ship as a gift for him. Unfortunately, the gift included a cask of rum, which the indigenous people proceeded to consume, after which they decided to murder the Spaniards by the cruellest methods. Many versions of the story conclude that no-one from the Joven Daniel survived. The findings of the commissioner of nations, Jos√© Antonio Z√∫√±iga, concur. 20th and 21st-century historians such as Gabriel Guarda and Jos√© Bengoa have however challenged the notion that there were no survivors. As of 2010 there was no consensus among historians on what really happened. Stories of the fate of Elisa Bravo However, there were various reports that Elisa Bravo may have been taken captive by the indigenous people and was still alive, living as wife to the cacique, in what is described as the most brutal forced coexistence resulting in children of \\"mixed blood\\". Troops were sent from Valdivia to rescue her, but could not even find her body; an indigenous person told them that she was buried on the beach with her young child and her servant, with just three stones to mark the place. Then in March 1853, a report appeared in The Times in London that Bravo had been found by a farm worker who had travelled into the interior in search of cattle. He met with a young woman whom he identified by the description she gave of herself and her parents. The piece concludes, \\"It is to be hoped that the long lost child will shortly be restored to her parents.\\" However, there is no subsequent report of any such reunion. Traveller Guillermo Cox is said to have seen Elisa Bravo in 1863. Another report dating from 1863 said that her captors, fearing vengeance from Spaniards, sold her to the Calfucur√° in Puelmapu for a hundred mares, but that she had died after three years. Social background and implications Several aspects of the story served to reinforce prejudices of the time, and were useful in justifying policies of colonisation and the evangelisation and subjugation of indigenous peoples. The supposed effect of alcohol on the indigenous people is described in graphic terms: \\"‚Ä¶ Indians cannot resist it, and drink it [‚Ä¶] till they get mad or helpless\\". Their transformation from civil welcome to diabolical murderers is presented as evidence of their uncivilised primitive barbarity, embodying the wild idea of evil. Elisa Bravo, by contrast, presents a figure of heroic virtue, the stereotype of the virtuous woman resisting, albeit unsuccessfully, the depraved savages who immolate her companions and violate her, producing a family of mestizos (mongrels). This aspect of the story inspired Monvoisin in his two paintings of her.

The name means \\"Ruby Garden\\" or \\"Gem Garden\\". It was designed and built by the German architect Eckart Muthesius on behalf of Maharaja Yashwant Rao Holkar II in 1930. On the outside and the inside it was in the Bauhaus and Art Deco style, making it a Gesamtkunstwerk. (available on Issuu)  History  Furniture pieces from Manik Bagh, designed by √âmile-Jacques Ruhlmann in 1932, in an exhibition at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris H.H. The Maharajah of Indore portrait by Bernard Boutet de Monvel, painted in 1929 The palace was commissioned by Maharaja Yashwant Rao Holkar II for the use of himself and his wife Sanyogita Devi. It was built and furnished between 1930 and 1939 by the German architect Eckart Muthesius, and its design combines the Bauhaus style in architecture and Art Deco in the interior decoration. The prince and the architect had first met in 1928 in England. The 40 rooms of the U-shaped building were all connected directly or through terraces. For the 80 or so servants in the house a separate external corridor was created. Because the walls could neither be wallpapered nor covered with silk due to the high humidity of the rainy months, Muthesius decided to come up with a solution by having the finest glass dust blown on the previously prepared walls. The floor was laid out in marble. The furniture, which was predominantly shaped according to the Bauhaus model, was made of black ebony, as were most of the columns. Muthesius designed for example the bar, lamps and some furniture. The furniture was partly dismantled in Berlin, packed and shipped to Indore. A friend of the maharaja, Henri- Pierre Roch√© brought together for him a crystal service by Baccarat, silverware by Jean Puiforcat customised with the royal arms, a deckchair by Eileen Gray, a floor lamp by Jean Perzel, a chaiselongue by Le Corbusier and screens by Drian. The aluminium beds were made by Louis Sognot and Charlotte Alix. Famous French designer Jacques-√âmile Ruhlmann designed a \\"Studio for a Crown Prince of the Indies\\" with a huge map of India on the wall. The black and orange carpets with geometric patterns were by Ivan da Silva-Bruhns. Two large double-portraits of the maharajah and his wife were done by Bernard Boutet de Monvel in 1929 and were placed in the palace. In the garden, there was a project to create a garden with a \\"temple of meditation\\", with an installation of the bird sculptures by Brancusi that the maharaja owned. With the premature death of the maharani the project was never completed. Muthesius had to leave India after the outbreak of the World War II. After the premature death of his wife Sanyogita Diva, the maharajah started to retreat from his interest in contemporary art and architecture and returned less to Manik Bagh. The interior decoration was sold and in 1980 auctioned at Sotheby's in Monaco. Manik Bagh is now used by the Office of the Commissioner, CGST, Customs & Central Excise. The Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris had an exhibition in 2019 called \\"Moderne Maharajah\\" dedicated to Yashwant Rao Holkar II and Manik Bagh, featuring some of the interior pieces such as the aluminium bed by Louis Sognot and Charlotte Alix, as well as pieces by Jacques-√âmile Ruhlmann.

Founded in 1998 with a goal to reduce the fixed-wing commercial aviation fatality rate in the United States by 80 percent by 2007. By 2007 CAST was able to report that by implementing safety enhancements, the fatality rate of commercial air travel in the United States was reduced by 83 percent. In 2008, the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) won the Collier Trophy. CAST origins The Commercial Aviation Safety Team was founded in 1997 in response to the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security Report that called for a reduction of the commercial aviation accident rate by 80 percent by 2007. From their analysis of thousands of aviation incidents and accidents, CAST formed lessons learned and envisioned critical safety enhancements. Their efforts marked 2008 as the safest year in commercial aviation. Fatal commercial accidents reduced by 83 percent, to a probability of one in 22.8 million flights. CAST focuses on Part 121 scheduled airliner operations. The CAST team uses a data-driven approach to: analyze safety data; identify hazards; develop specific safety enhancements; implement cost-effective safety enhancements; track implementation; monitor the effectiveness of the safety mitigations; and use experience to continually improve the aviation system. The CAST team shares it's findings with aviation safety organizations around the world. The CAST team's new goal is to reduce the remaining part 121 accident risk (50%) by 2025. It plans to achieve this goal by using industry data and analytical tools from Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing Initiative. CAST safety enhancement selected examples The CAST Team developed dozens of safety enhancements highlighted by: * Terrain Awareness Warning System * Precision-Like Approaches - Area navigation Required Navigation Performance * Minimum Safe Altitude Warning * Proactive Safety Programs (Flight operations quality assurance + Aviation Safety Action Program) * Crew Resource Management Training * Controlled flight into terrain Prevention Training * Flight Crew Proficiency Program * Human Factors and Automation * Advanced Maneuver Training * Displays and Alerting Systems * Basic Airplane Design ‚Äì Icing * Envelope Protection ‚Äì New Designs * Enhanced Airport Surveillance Equipment * ATC Procedures ‚Äì Capacity Enhancement Program * Pilot Training for Runway incursion Prevention * Turbulence Procedures for Reducing Cabin Injuries * Un- contained Engine Failures * Synthetic vision system * Datalink * Cargo Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Processing * Mitigations for Hazardous Material Fires * Safety Culture * TCAS Policies and Procedures * Enhanced Surface Marking and Lighting * Airplane State Awareness - Effective Upset Prevention and Recovery Training * Area Navigation ‚Äì Procedures and Standards to Improve Path Compliance for STARs and Area Navigation departures * Runway excursion - Landing Distance Assessment * Runway Excursion - Overrun Awareness and Alerting Systems * Takeoff Misconfiguration - Air Carrier Procedures for Takeoff Configuration Additionally the CAST team set goals for future safety enhancements.

More recent art historians argue its style is close to works he produced between 1524 and 1526.

The medallion at the foot of the Madonna's throne shows a group of people from the procession, including an infantry captain (the work's commissioner), the heads of companies, trumpeters, pipers, dealers, \\"commanders\\" and \\"benchers\\". The monastery was destroyed during the 1529 Siege of Florence and the work was in the Ospedale Sant'Eusebio al Prato in the western part of Florence's historic city centre by 1813, when it was looted from there by Napoleon and taken to Paris.

She is the President of the British Rhinological Society. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hopkins successfully campaigned to have anosmia recognised as a symptom of coronavirus disease in the United Kingdom.  Early life and education  Hopkins studied physiology and medicine at the University of Oxford and gained her Doctor of Medicine (DM) degree in 2004. Whilst at Oxford, Hopkins was awarded the Martin Wronker Prize for Medicine. She trained in otorhinolaryngology at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, where she was appointed a fellow in rhinology. At the start of her career endoscopic sinus surgery was becoming more commonplace. Early in her clinical training Hopkins worked on the National Audit of Sinonasal surgery, with whom she conducted one of the first multi- centre outcome studies in sinus surgery. The study, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT) 22, is a patient-reported measure of outcome outcome measure, and it is now used both nationally and internationally.  Research and career  Hopkins was later appointed a consultant Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon at the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. Her focus is rhinology, the 'N' of ENT. Speaking about the considerable underrepresentation of women in medicine, Hopkins said, \\"if I had a pound for every time a patient had asked me (after I examined the patient... and went through the consent process for surgery), 'so will I ever get to meet the Professor Hopkins, is he here?' I would have retired a long time ago,\\". Hopkins helped to construct international guidelines for the management of nasal polyps. In an interview with Student and Foundation Doctors in Otolaryngology (SFOUK), Hopkins explained that \\"..the downside of being so specialised is that after a day in outpatients, I sometimes feel as if I am drowning in snot\\". Hopkins was made a Professor of Rhinology in 2016. In 2017 Hopkins she gave her inaugural lecture at King's College London, where she discussed her efforts to improve the effectiveness of sinus surgery interventions. In 2019 Hopkins was elected President of the British Rhinological Society. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hopkins argued that anosmia (i.e. the loss of sense of smell) should be included in the list of symptoms of coronavirus disease, and that people who suffer from anosmia should self-isolate. Speaking to the BBC, Hopkins explained that anosmia is a common symptom of coronavirus disease in young people, and that it can have a rapid onset without any accompanying blocked nose. In particular, she did not notice significant nasal congestion or rhinorrhea in coronavirus disease patients in her own clinical practise. Data from a coronavirus tracking app developed by King's College London indicated that almost 60% of people who test positive for coronavirus disease had lost their sense of smell or taste, which was more than those who had experienced fever. Hopkins said that most people regain their sense of smell within a fortnight. She worked with a group of physicians from across Europe to better understand the sense of smell of coronavirus disease positive patients. Together the team were able to show that there is 95 % chance that people who experience a sudden loss of smell without any other symptoms would test positive for coronavirus disease. Working with ENT UK, the United Kingdom's professional body that represents ENT surgeons, and the charity Fifth Sense, Hopkins provided patient advice for people who experience anosmia due to coronavirus disease. In April 2020 Hopkins worked with Nirmal Kumar to create a citizen science project (#CovidSmellTest) which asked people to smell household objects and resort their results. In a survey of over 4,000 coronavirus disease patients Hopkins and the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research found that COVID-19 patients experienced an 80% drop in their sense of smell, and almost a 70% drop in their sense of taste. Hopkins was particularly concerned that key workers who continued to work when suffering from anosmia could have been inadvertently spreading coronavirus disease. In mid May 2020 Hopkins claimed that it was \\"clinical negligence\\" for NHS 111 not to recognise anosmia as being a likely symptom of coronavirus disease. She also emphasised that losing a sense of smell can be so isolating that it causes depression. On May 18 2020 the Government of the United Kingdom acknowledged that anosmia was a recognised symptom of coronavirus disease. Hopkins worked with the British Rhinological Society to create a series of online courses for patients and general practitioners. = Selected publications =  =Awards and honours= Hopkins is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS).

It did not go into production. Design and development The Golden Bear was a high wing aircraft built around a welded steel tube structure which incorporated chrome-molybdenum alloys where stresses were high. The two spar wing was rectangular in plan and braced to the lower fuselage longerons with parallel struts from the spars. The central wing was joined to the top of the cabin. On the prototype the wing, like the rest of the aircraft, was fabric-covered, though production models would have had metal covering. The prototype was powered by a Comet 7-D seven cylinder radial engine, mounted with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling, though the second example was scheduled to have a seven cylinder Wright J-6-7 Whirlwind. The cabin was well-windowed for both pilot and passengers, with a windowed luggage compartment aft and doors on both sides. There were two unusual safety features. The central wing structure provided space for an aircraft rescue parachute, a concept under test at the time. Second, the cabin doors could be jettisoned together in flight with a single lever so that the two passengers could escape individually and rapidly by parachute. The tail was conventional, with a low aspect ratio, roughly rectangular plan horizontal tail mounted on top of the fuselage. It had a cropped triangular fin with a rounded, balanced rudder which reached down to the keel. The Golden Bear had conventional, fixed landing gear, with independent axles and drag struts from the lower fuselage longerons. The vertical, shock absorbing legs were mounted on the forward wing struts at points reinforced by short struts to both upper and lower fuselage longerons. Its tailwheel was also fitted with a shock absorber. The date of the Golden Bear's first flight is not known, though its test programme was flown by Ray Crayford from the then new Berkeley, California airport. By August 1929 the first production shop of a proposed factory was completed. The prototype survived until August 1939 when it was destroyed by a crowd at an Oakland Speedway thrill show, disappointed at not getting their money's worth. It is not known if the second example was completed.

Early life and family Clare Marsh was born Emily Cecil Clare Marsh 13 January 1875 at New Court, Bray, County Wicklow, the house of her maternal grandfather, Andrew McCullagh, a wine merchant. Her parents were Arthur and Rachel Marsh (n√©e McCullagh). She had 4 siblings. Her family were descended from the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, specifically from Francis Marsh of Edgeworth in Gloucester with his wife the great-aunt of James II's first wife. The family later moved to Raheen, Clondalkin, and later to Cappaghmore, Clondalkin. There is little information about her early life. She was involved in the suffrage movement. Career Marsh met Mary Swanzy at May Manning's art classes, with Swanzy remembering Marsh as being from \\"a background of impecuniosity, which did not apparently worry them in spite of a more affluent upbringing\\". Marsh was influenced artistically by her aunt and John Butler Yeats, with whom she became close friends. In summer of 1898, Yeats painted Marsh's portrait at Manning's studio. Marsh was more drawn to the work of Yeats than of his son, Jack, and modelled her portraits on that of the older Yeats. He mentored her, encouraging her to see other artists' work as much as possible and saying \\"to produce a picture will force you to think.\\" He urged her to paint more industriously. She exhibited with the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) for the first time in 1900 with East wind effect and Roses. Yeats later claimed that Marsh helped him with \\"line drawing or sketching, by putting him on the track of bulk drawing.\\" Alongside Manning's classes, she took night classes in sculpture with John Hughes and Oliver Sheppard at the Metropolitan School of Art. Aside from a trip to Paris in 1910 or 1911, Marsh seems to have been taught exclusively in Dublin throughout her 20s. She took a course at Norman Garstin's studio in Penzance, and stayed in North Wales in 1914, painting two Trearddur Bay scenes. Marsh painted still life and portraits, including one of Lily Yeats. It appears that her portraits of children and dogs were popular based on her submitted works to the RHA, exhibiting without a break from 1900 to 1921. The Hugh Lane Gallery holds her portrait of Lord Ashbourne, which demonstrates her painting style of loose brush strokes with an air of informality. Yeats suggested that she spend some time in the United States, where he was living at the time. She spent two months in New York, staying with cousins at White Plains and then moved into a room neighbouring that of Yeats in Petitpas. Her uncle strongly disproved of this living arrangement, so she left and returned to Ireland in January 1912, which upset Yeats greatly. Upon her return from New York, Marsh started holding classes at her studio at South Anne Street which Swanzy recalled were \\"well liked and always full\\", with Mrs Susan Yeats becoming a pupil. Marsh became the Professor of Fine Arts at Alexandra College in 1916. In the same year, Marsh painted the fires and destruction of the 1916 Easter Rising. She painted a portrait of Jack Butler Yeats in 1918, which is now held by the Highlanes Gallery. John Butler Yeats later sympathised with her in a letter that she and other women were not elected members of the RHA. Knowing that Yeats was in financial difficulty, she sold some of his drawings and sent the money to him. It appears that over time, Marsh worked more with colour, as demonstrated in her portrait of Mrs Susan Yeats. Her final paintings were night studies, some of which show a possible influence from Swanzy with whom she shared a studio in autumn 1920. She is also believed to have been one of the founding members of the Society of Dublin Painters. Death and legacy Marsh died on 5 May 1923. A posthumous exhibition of her work was held in October 1923. Due to her early death, Marsh largely fell into obscurity until one of her works was included in the 1987 \\"Irish Women Artists from the Eighteenth Century to the Present Day\\" exhibition and publication from the National Gallery of Ireland. The National Gallery of Ireland holds a selection of sketches and paintings by Marsh, and a sketch of her by Swanzy. She was included in an exhibition of art by women artists at the Highlanes Gallery in 2012.

He was described as being one of Michael Collins‚Äô most trusted agents.  Early life  Malone was born in the village of Meedin, near Tyrrellspass, County Westmeath to William Malone, a farmer and schoolteacher Marie Mulavn. He had a sister, Mary and two brothers Joseph and Tomas, with whom he would fight alongside throughout the Irish War of Independence. Due to his grandfather's exile due to activities in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, his father was born in London. He attended Rinn Dun Montessori School in Lecarrow, County Roscommon, before moving to the Christian Brothers school in Mullingar. He later gained a scholarship for Newbridge College. He studied Irish language extensively in Mullingar and also Spiddal, County Galway. He would later gain employment at the Armagh Christian Brothers school.  Easter Rising  Malone left Armagh after realizing he was working against John Redmond. He became involved with the Irish Republican Brotherhood with his brother, taking part in both the Howth gun-running and Kilcoole gun-running missions. In 1914 he began working at a school in Portlaoise, whilst here he was asked by Liam Mellows to spy. The following year he had left this position and was working at a Jesuit School in Limerick. He was issued the order to return to Tyrellspass upon the outbreak of the Easter Rising in 1916. During the rising a shootout took place at the family homestead in Meedin. The Royal Irish Constabulary raided the home and reports of at least 3 shots being fired were reported during the week. Due to his activities during the rising, he was arrested and spent captivity in both Limerick and Richmond Barracks before being sent to Wakefield and Frongoch. Upon release he was offered a position working under Conradh na Gaeilge in North Tipperary. Michael Collins ordered him to relocate to Cork under the alias ‚ÄòLiam Forde‚Äô due to his popularity in Tipperary. His brother Tomas adopted the name 'S√©an Forde'. Here he worked at the Christian Brothers school on Sullivan's Quay.  Irish War of Independence  In December 1918 he was arrested along with his brother at Kilfinane. They were held in Athenry before escaping. During the Irish War of Independence, he headed the East Limerick Brigade of the Irish Republican Army. During the Irish Civil War, he opposed the Anglo-Irish treaty. He began teaching in a room in Tyrrellspass Castle, and even established a school named the Thomas Davis Secondary School, however the Department of Education refused to officially recognize the school.  Later life  Following the war, he returned to teaching. He was teaching in Cork following the Second World War. In 1958 he wrote an autobiography titled 'B'fhi√∫ an braon fola' (The drop of blood was worth it). At the end of his career, he was working as a teacher in Rathmines. Malone died on March 8, 1959 at Deansgrange, County Dublin he is buried at the Deans Grange Cemetery.

The drawing must have been produced between 1532 and 1533 and the painting in 1533, before Michelangelo left for Rome the following year. A drawing found in Naples was once thought to be Michelangelo's, but is now thought to be a copy. The painting was owned by Alessandro de' Medici and early in its life it was censored to cover Venus's nudity, as was the Rome copy. It was recorded in inventories of the Guardaroba medicea in 1553 and 1560 and was praised by Benedetto Varchi, who wrote that it made men fall in love with it \\"as with Praxiteles's Venus\\". The work was only rediscovered in 1850 and two years later the restorer Ulisse Forni removed most of the repainting except for the piece of cloth across Venus's genitalia, mostly restoring it to its original appearance. That cloth was finally removed in 2002. Ettore Camesasca, Michelangelo pittore, Rizzoli, Milano 1966.

With the independence of Cuba in 1898, due to the peace treaty between the US and Spain, only the natives of the Peninsula retained Spanish nationality, so he became a Cuban citizen.  Biography  Secundino Delgado Rodriguez was born on October 5, 1867 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the son of a blacksmith Secundino Delgado del Castillo and Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez Hern√°ndez. It was at that time that the first workers' organizations and associations began to emerge in Tenerife; However, despite the fact that little by little they would become politicized, the function of these first associations was fundamentally based on welfare and charity, although there was also interest in the training and education of workers, at a time when the vast majority of people were illiterate. For some time, Secundino lived in the Tenerife municipality of Arafo. = Emigration to Cuba = A cochineal crisis caused a large part of the Canarian population to be forced to emigrate to the Americas, the preferred destinations being Cuba and Venezuela. Thus, Secundino Delgado, like many Canarians, emigrated to Cuba in 1885. On the Caribbean island, Secundino joined the Cuban independence movement, establishing contact with anarchist sectors of the independentist groups in Tampa. He began to work in a tobacco factory and participated in the writing of the workers' newspaper \\"El Esclavo\\" (The Slave), an anarchist weekly that defended the independence of Cuba. Secundino Delgado actively participated in the organizing of the 1895 Tampa tobacco strike, leading him to be arrested along with many of his fellow activists. He moved to Key West and from there returned to Havana, where he worked as a blacksmith in a transport company ‚Äì here he continued his political activities and was fired as a result. Subsequently, he was accused by the Spanish colonial authorities of making the explosive used in an attack against the Captaincy General of Cuba. = Stay in Venezuela = In 1896 he returned to the Canary islands, staying for a few months in Santa Cruz de Tenerife before emigrating again (due to Valeriano Weyler's order for his imprisonment), this time towards Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. It was from this moment that Secundino began to consider the \\"Canarian national question\\". Already in Venezuela, Secundino Delgado began to establish contacts with the Canarian colony that resided there, organizing a Canarian independence movement. He came into contact with the federal republicans of La Palma and was influenced by of the mutualist Francisco Pi y Margall, who had been president during the First Spanish Republic. Together they founded the newspaper \\"El Guanche\\", with Secundino as editor and publisher. Despite the fact that his collaborators did not come from this environment, Secundino maintained his proletarian attitudes. Due to the Venezuelan prohibition on foreign participation in the country's politics, the dissemination of propaganda was affected, however, this did not prevent Secundino from continuing to sign articles where he spoke of internationalism, and of the proletariat as \\"one family\\". The newspaper was published during the Cuban War of Independence, and this is reflected in its content, making constant calls for Canarians not to participate in the Spanish army. Secundino Delgado himself appealed to conscripts from all over Spain to rebel against their own army and join the revolutionary workers who were fighting for the independence of Cuba. The military intervention of the United States in the conflict in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines caused the final closure of El Guanche. This intervention produced a boom in Spanish nationalism, which affected the Canarian community of Venezuela. The editors of El Guanche and the Canarian nationalist movement feared that the Americans would invade the Canary Islands, although they continued to attack Spain for their attitude in the Antilles and in the Canary Islands. Due to the situation they decided to suspend publication of the newspaper until the conflict was resolved. In the 1920s, the Canarian Nationalist Party (PNC) founded a new newspaper in Cuba also called El Guanche. = Return to the Canary Islands = Secundino Delgado was expelled from Venezuela in 1898 and returned to the Canary Islands, at a time of agrarian proletarianization and a growth of the urban proletariat. At that moment, new monocultures of bananas and tomatoes were being introduced and port activities in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the two main cities of the archipelago, brought about urban industralization. Delgado participated in the formation of the Canarian Workers Association and its newspaper \\"El Obrero\\", dedicated to the ideas of uniting the workers. Although there were anarchists and socialists in the Canary Islands Workers Association, the position of the association's leadership tended towards reformism. Although Secundino Delgado started from a tradition close to anarchism, and had previously defended class struggle, he decided to partly adapt to the policies of the workers association, which had established a workers' party to stand for election: the Partido Popular Autonomista (PPA). The PPA declared itself as autonomist, going so far as to deny on several occasions that it was an organization that defended the independence of the Canary Islands. The PPA stood for the municipal elections of 1901 but obtained only one city councilor in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. After this electoral defeat, the Canary Islands Workers Association quickly dissociated itself completely from the PPA. Secundino Delgado, deprived of the Association's body of expression, El Obrero, founded a newspaper with the headline \\"¬°Vacaguar√©!\\". In 1902 Secundino Delgado was arrested, accused by the Minister of War, Valeriano Weyler, of manufacturing the explosive used in the attack against the Captaincy General of Cuba in 1896. He was imprisoned in the C√°rcel Modelo, where he was visited by the anarchist Ferm√≠n Salvochea and by Nicol√°s Est√©vanez. Secundino's thoughts again returned to the issues of anarchism and independence. On his release from prison, after being released without charge, he wrote two stories for the anarchist publication \\"Revista Blanca\\". He returned to the Canary Islands for some time before going to travel around the American continent, visiting Nicol√°s Est√©vanez in Havana and publishing \\"Vacaguar√©!\\" in Mexico. In 1910 he returned to his homeland. At this time his son and daughter died, and shortly after, in 1912, Secundino Delgado died from a pulmonary consumption.  Bibliography  * BRITO, Oswaldo.

According to the biography of Nicholas Ferrar in 1631 she was \\"a tall, straight, deep complexioned, grave matron, of eighty years of age\\".J E B Mayor, ed, Nicholas Ferrar. Two Lives by his Brother John and by Doctor Jebb, Cambridge in the Seventeenth Century. Part I. Nicholas Ferrar, (Cambridge: Printed for the Editor, 1855), 380, Digital Image Internet Archive (https://archive.org/stream/nicholasferrartw00mayouoft#page/380/mode/2up : accessed 8 March 2018) Little Gidding Mary Ferrar had a tablet placed in the family's parlour. Sir Thomas Hetley requested a copy, so, although the original has long been lost, the wording and the arrangement of the original text was preserved. Here it is as published in The Life and Times of Nicholas Ferrar by H. P. K. Skipton. In 1620 Esm√© Stewart, the Earl of March (1579‚Äì1624) and Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire (later, briefly, the 3rd Duke of Lennox), sold the manor of Little Gidding to Thomas Sheppard. The Ferrars and Wodenoths were investors in the Virginia Company and other colonial projects and when the Virginia Company collapsed in 1624 taking with it a large portion of their fortune John Ferrar faced financial ruin. Mary Ferrar realised that a home needed to be found for her family. She looked at Little Gidding and the population having declined in this rural area Sheppard sold the practically derelict property to Mary's son Nicholas Ferrar and her nephew Arthur Wodenoth (or Woodnoth) (c1590‚Äìc1650) in 1625 as trustees for Mary Ferrar, using her dower to purchase the property on her behalf. Here, after considerable renovation, the Ferrar family retreated to take on a humble, spiritual life of prayer, eschewing material, worldly life. In 1625 during a period of plague in London Mary Ferrar took refuge with her daughter Susanna Collet near Bourn in Cambridgeshire, and the following year as Mary herself moved into Little Gidding after it had been made somewhat more habitable she persuaded her daughter and her family to join her. The popular wisdom of the time was that it took a man and a woman to successfully run a household in the persons of a husband and wife, and while it was not unusual for women to be the head of a family or to own property in the 17th-century, the situation at Little Gidding was rather more unconventional as not only did the widowed Mary Ferrar share responsibility for the community with her unmarried son but two other adult males (and their families) also submitted to her authority in the persons of her son John Ferrar and son-in-law John Collet. Between 1625 and 1629 Nicholas Ferrar spent much of his time in London and in 1626 he was ordained as a Deacon by William Laud (1573‚Äì1645) then Bishop of St David's and later Archbishop of Canterbury.\\"A brief history of Little Gidding\\" (The Official Website of St John's Church, Little Gidding, Cambridgeshire, England). Retrieved 4 January 2013. Soon the small community was joined by Mary's son John Ferrar and his family. Mary and her son Nicholas worked closely together to ensure the smooth running of their community and during his absence in London Nicholas Ferrar wrote frequent letters to ensure that his strong-willed mother's wishes were heeded and acted upon as the owner of the property. She, for her part, valued his wisdom and vision and through her affection for him often deferred to his opinion. The extended Ferrar family numbering about 40 people transformed their holdings at Little Gidding into a humble Anglican religious community. When they purchased it, the property consisted of a decayed manor house and the village's medieval parish church of St John which had not been worshipped in for 60 years.Clive Aslet, Villages of Britain: The Five Hundred Villages that Made the Countryside, Bloomsbury (2010) - Google Books pp. 252-254 The Ferrars began repairing the site, with Mary's first priority being the church, which had been desecrated through use as a barn and which was so full of hay that at first she was unable to enter to pray. By 1629 it was fully restored. During this period Mary Ferrar commenced a series of charitable works among the local community, endowing an almshouse in the form of a large room in her house for four elderly local widows who were regarded as part of the household and joined the daily prayers. A school was founded for children of the family and the children of friends but excluded local children. A dispensary was set up in the house to provide broth and medicines to local residents.Nicholas Ferrar at Little Gidding - Little Gidding Church website The community was never a formal religious community, as with a monastery or convent. They did not have an official Rule (such as the Rule of Saint Benedict), no vows were required, and no enclosure. The Ferrar household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer. They engaged in tending to the health and education of local children, and became skilled in bookbinding. The Ferrar household was criticised by Puritans and denounced as a \\"Protestant Nunnery\\" and as Arminian heresy; in 1641 it was attacked in a pamphlet entitled \\"The Arminian Nunnery\\". The fame of the Ferrars and the Little Gidding community spread and they attracted visitors. King Charles I visited Little Gidding three times, including on 2 May 1646 seeking refuge after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Naseby and was given temporary refuge by John Ferrar. When Mary Ferrar died in 1634 she was buried at St John's Church and bequeathed Little Gidding to her son Nicholas Ferrar. He died in December 1637 but the community continued under the leadership of his brother, John Ferrar until 1657, when he and his sister Susanna Collet died within a month of each other. After her death John Farrer was to describe his mother as, \\"the head in the Body and the Bond and Simont (cement) to hould the whole Body of our Family United not only in Cohabitation but in Hartes\\". Years later he wrote to his son of \\"Your Pious Grandmother and devoute Vnkell [as] the Founders of our Family and p[re]sent State We possess in Gidding\\". A family friend was to write to her nephew Arthur Wodenoth that he recalled Mary Ferrar as \\"one who brought a new Religion into the world.\\" ReferencesNotes Category:1551 births Category:1634 deaths Category:17th-century Anglicans Category:17th-century Christian mystics Category:Bookbinders Category:Members of Anglican religious orders Category:People from Little Gidding Category:Protestant mystics ","title":"Mary Ferrar"},{"id":"64102035","text":"Stanton Earl Mitchell (August 17, 1944 ‚Äî January 24, 2012) was an American football fullback who played in the National Football League.

The company was founded by Jongjoon Won, who was previously a fund manager at Truston Asset Management and Brain Asset Management. In 2015 the company shifted to being operated as a hedge fund management firm. The company quickly developed by a private fund that focused on investment in mezzanine financial products. It was revealed that Vice- President Jongpil Lee of the company embezzled funds from companies where customer assets had been invested. Issues In July 2019, LIME began selling convertible bonds of companies listed on the KOSDAQ, and around this time, suspicion arose that the company was maintaining an illegal rate of return. The share prices of stocks that were in the fund run by LIME crashed, and there were concerns of an imminent fund run crises. This led to redemptions being frozen. The issue was caused by purchasing a large volume of insolvent assets, including mezzanine of KOSDAQ zombie companies, for increasing the rate of return in the short-term. In Korea there are regulations which limit how many bonds that can be owned by one entity. However, to bypass this regulation, \\"parking transactions\\" were done, by making purchases in the name of another company. It is also alleged that when the fund experienced a loss, returns were fabricated by replacing the loss with monies from another fund. Timeline of the case On February 19, 2020, the Prosecutor's Office conducted a search and seizure in connection with Shinhan Asset Management and LIME Asset Management. On March 31, 2020, associates of Chairman Kim of Star Mobility was arrested. On April 23, 2020, at around 9:00pm, Jongpil Lee, former vice president of LIME, and Bonghyeon Kim, former chairman of Star Mobility, were arrested outside of a residence in the Seongbuk-gu area of Seoul. Former chairman Kim was hiding out together with former LIME vice- president Jongpil Lee, and was keeping 530 million won in cash (about US$428,000), and was storing 5.5 billion won (about US$4.4 million) in a rental locker located in Seoul. Former chairman Kim testified to the police, \\"[I] was transporting three luggage carriers containing 5.5 billion won, and since they were so heavy, I hurt my back.\\" At the end of April 2020, the Financial Supervisory Service carried out a due diligence investigation of Woori Bank and Hana Bank, which sold LIME Asset Management. An additional due diligence investigation of two or three securities companies was also scheduled.

Her early research focused on Calmodulin, though the primary focus of her lab has since shifted to the molecular machinery of cell division in budding yeast, especially the microtubule organizing centers and the kinetochores.  Background and education  Trisha Davis received her BA in Computer Science and Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1976. She received her Ph.D. in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale University in 1983. She joined the University of Washington Department of Biochemistry in 1997 and became acting chair of the department in 2011. In 2013, she became the first female chair of the Department.  Work and discoveries  Davis's post-doctoral research focused on Calmodulin in budding yeast After starting her own lab at the University of Washington, she discovered that Calmodulin performs an essential function in the yeast spindle pole body , beginning the lab's gradual transition into the study of mitosis. The Davis Lab has published extensively on the spindle pole body and on the kinetochore . Much of the recent research, conducted in collaboration with the Asbury Lab at the University of Washington, uses biophysical techniques such as optical tweezers to quantify the microtubule-coupling activity of the kinetochore.

It was published in 1831 and is one of the √âtudes philosophiques of La Com√©die humaine. Plot summary The story is set in Tours in 1479. It starts with Marie de Saint-Vallier, an illegitimate daughter of Louis XI attending mass at Tours Cathedral with her much older husband, the Comte de Saint- Vallier. He falls asleep, and Marie's lover Georges d‚ÄôEstouteville comes over to speak to her. He tells her that he will meet her that night in her home, by breaking in from the home of Cornelius Hoogworst who lives next door. Cornelius Hoogworst is a wealthy silversmith and merchant who does business with the King and wealthy courtiers. He is an elderly miser who lives with his sister in a big house and is originally from Ghent. During his time in Tours, his home has been robbed three times, and each time his apprentices were blamed, and executed. This has made him feared and hated in Tours. Georges then presents himself to Cornelius, and asks to become his apprentice. He is accepted with the help of a forged letter from another merchant in Ghent. He is given a room in Cornelius' home, and during the night escapes next door for a rendezvous with Marie. Whilst this happens Cornelius' home is again robbed of valuable jewelry. So the next morning, Georges is arrested, because Cornelius has noticed that he was absent from his room. When Marie learns of the arrest of her lover, she immediately arranges to see her father, the King. Marie and her husband travel to the King's residence at Plessis-lez-Tours on the outskirts of Tours. When she is alone with her father, she tells him that Georges could not have been the thief, because he was with her. She also says that she does not love her husband and is scared of him. The King then arranges for her husband to be sent on a diplomatic trip to Venice. He also summons Cornelius, and tells him that he will visit his home immediately. The King goes to Cornelius' home to investigate the robbery. He inspects the strong room, and find that the locks have not been forced. He then orders that guards be set up to watch the house through the night. The next day, another theft from the strong room is discovered, but the lock was not forced. Cornelius was also seen outside during the night, though he has no memory of this. The King's doctor, then tells them that the explanation is that Cornelius is a sleep walker, and almost certainly has been robbing and hiding his own valuables. As a result of this, Georges is spared. Cornelius is now treated with suspicion by the King, but is not punished. However he lives in torment because of the missing valuables, and the fact that he has lost the King's favour. Three years later, Cornelius commits suicide, without having found out where he put the stolen treasures. Background Balzac was motivated to write this story to give a more favourable portrayal of Louis XI than that given by Walter Scott in Quentin Durward. He makes reference to Quentin Durward in the story, by correcting its description of Plessis-lez- Tours. He wrote \\"In spite of the singular fancy which possessed the author of ‚ÄúQuentin Durward‚Äù to place the royal castle of Plessis-lez-Tours upon a height, we must content ourselves by leaving it where it really was, namely on low land, protected on either side by the Cher and the Loire...\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Maitre Cornelius\\", translation (by Katharine Prescott Wormeley) at Project Gutenberg (full text) Category:1831 short stories Category:French short stories Category:Books of La Com√©die humaine Category:Short stories by Honor√© de Balzac Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XI of France ","title":"Ma√Ætre Corn√©lius"},{"id":"64102393","text":"Kenneth Bernard Gibler (January 31, 1931 ‚Äì November 23, 1990) was an American football and track coach.

In 1755, when Steele had a studio at Redmaynes Yard in Kendal, the young George Romney was apprenticed to him for four years on payment of ¬£21. Romney, in his memoirs, reported several adventures with his teacher, mostly of the wine, women, and song variety, In 1756, Steele eloped with an heiress and settled in Lancashire, freeing Romney of his indentures. His wife died in 1761 and Steele moved to New York and then Philadelphia, where he received several commissions. But he failed to complete them, and his older brother Henry, who had emigrated to Maryland in the 1740s and had become a successful planter, had to make restoration to the families whose money Christopher had taken. He returned to Egremont in 1767 and died the following year. Grove Dictionary of Art says of him that, \\"Despite his dissipation and indolence Steele was far from being an \\"itinerant dauber,\\" as he is sometimes described. Over thirty works are at present attributed to him; they indicate that he was familiar with the works of Thomas Hudson and other contemporary portrait painters based in London. Steele's awareness of texture and finish place him far above the typical provincial painter of his time.\\" Steele's works are held in Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal Town Hall, and the Merchant Adventurers' Hall, York.

Thomas was educated in Edessa. There he taught Greek to the future patriarch, Aba. He later travelled with Aba around the Roman Empire, including to its capital, Constantinople. & ; but doubts that the teacher of Aba was the theologian. He has at times been confused with Thomas of Harkel. He studied under Aba at the school of Nisibis in the Persian Empire. He also taught at Nisibis. He may have died in Constantinople or on his return journey to Nisibis. Thomas was influenced by the theology of Theodore of Mopsuestia. He wrote several works, but only two survive and only one of these has been printed.  øAbdisho ø bar Brikha ascribes to him some buyyƒÅye (hortatory discourses), a refutation of astrology, some treatises against heresy in the form of disputations and an epistolary treatise on qƒÅle, that is, stanzaic syllabic chants. His commentaries on the feasts of Nativity and Epiphany are the oldest extant examples in the genre of  øelta (cause, explanation, etiology). Only his explanation of the Nativity has been printed.

Despite seaborne terrorist attacks accounting for only 2% of all international terrorist incidents from 1978 to 2008, according to RAND's Terrorism Database, Southeast Asia has proven a hotbed of maritime terrorism. Due to the high frequency of pirates in the region, many Southeast Asian-based terrorist groups have appropriated piratical tactics in carrying out their violent political struggles. In 2003, the International Maritime Bureau reported that out of the 445 actual or attempted piratical attacks on merchant vessels, 189 occurred in Southeast Asia, which was more cases than either Africa or Latin America, with 121 attacks occurring in Indonesian waters and 35 attacks occurring in Malaysian and Singaporean waters. In 2004, while the number of actual and attempted attacks fell to 325, Southeast Asia remained at the top of the regional rankings, with 93 incidents occurring in Indonesian waters. Between 2014 and 2018, 242 attacks occurred in Southeast Asia, with the majority occurring in Indonesian waters. The most popular weapons of choice among Southeast Asian maritime terrorists have been explosive devices and firearms, which were used in roughly 60% of maritime attacks in the region. The concepts of maritime terrorismDefinitions of maritime terrorism= Maritime terrorism, like terrorism itself, is an essentially contested concept. Because there are over 100 definitions of terrorism from multiple sources, there is no commonly held definition. However, despite this situation there are still multiple UN conventions and regional legal processes to respond to maritime terrorist incidents. The most prominent definition for maritime terrorism within Southeast Asia seems to have been given by the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP) Working Group who defined maritime terrorism as: However, according to Sheng, beyond the specific definition of maritime terrorism provided by the CSCAP, legal and political analysts are faced with a paradox; given that there is no universal definition of ‚Äòterrorism‚Äô, how can a definition of ‚Äòmaritime terrorism‚Äô possibly be reached, considering its status as a subvariant of terrorism? =International maritime laws and treaties= Before 1988, there had been a debate within the international legal community as to whether acts of maritime terrorism could be meaningfully prosecuted under anti-piracy legislation put forward as a part of the UNCLOS III agreement in 1982. The main debate took place around what precisely was meant by the ‚Äòprivate ends‚Äô that UNCLOS III classed as an attribute of piracy. International legal scholars like Douglas Guilfoyle argued that ‚Äòprivate‚Äô referred to a lack of state sanctioning behind the act, viewing ‚Äòprivate‚Äô and ‚Äòpublic‚Äô as the relevant dichotomy. Other scholars, like Saiful Karim, argued that ‚Äòprivate‚Äô referred to the presence of a profit motive behind the act, thus viewing ‚Äòprivate‚Äô and ‚Äòpolitical‚Äô as the relevant dichotomy. Karim based this assessment off attempts to codify anti- piracy laws that date back to committee work by the League of Nations during the inter-war period. A foundational convention that has been important in defining maritime terrorism was the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) of 1988 and its accompanying SUA Fixed Platform Protocol. Although SUA 1988 did not define either ‚Äòterrorism‚Äô or ‚Äòmaritime terrorism‚Äô, it was a response to the 1985 attack on the Achille Lauro cruise ship, a high-profile terrorist incident. The United Nations General Assembly subsequently requested the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to study terrorist attacks aboard or against ships, with an aim towards making recommendations for countermeasures. In November 1986, Italy, Austria and Egypt submitted a draft to the IMO for a new convention for the suppression of maritime terrorism, which had taken influences from 3 previous counterterrorist conventions; the Hague Convention on Aircraft Hijacking, the Montreal Convention on Sabotage of Airplanes and the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. After 2 years of deliberation, the IMO adopted the 1988 SUA Convention. The provisions of the convention made the threatened or actual hijacking, damaging or destruction of vessels and violence against crew prosecutable offences under the convention as such acts threatened the safe navigation of ships. Unlawful acts committed for both private and political ends were covered under the convention and an obligation was imposed on all states party to the agreement to extradite or prosecute convention offenders resident upon their territory. The SUA Fixed Platform Protocol was also signed at the 1988 Rome Convention after the United States and Spain raised the issue of fixed platforms as potential terrorist targets. The SUA Protocol thus made it a prosecutable offence to launch attacks against a fixed platform on the proviso that the fixed platform is attached to the seabed, serves economic purposes like resource exploration or exploitation and operates on a continental shelf. However, the 1988 SUA Convention and Protocol did possess several flaws, one of which was the fact that both pieces of legislation were reactive towards maritime terrorist acts and offered no preventative provisions or measures to prevent maritime terrorist acts from taking place, as put forth by Justin S. C. Mellor. In effect, the legislation was merely in place to prosecute perpetrators in the aftermath of the crime rather than provide contracting states with powers and legal authority to interdict and prevent violations of the 1988 SUA Convention and Protocol. Following 9/11, the IMO adopted IMO Assembly Resolution A.924(22) which called for a review of existing legislation and measures that aimed to prevent terrorist acts against the safety and security of passengers, crew members and vessels. In October 2001, the IMO Legal Committee initiated a review of the 1988 SUA Convention and Protocol, with April 2002 witnessing the creation of a US-led Correspondence Group which would provide the IMO Legal Committee with a working paper containing potential amendments to SUA 1988 for the Legal Committee's 85th session in October 2003. The amendments suggested by the Correspondence Group presented before the IMO Legal Committee included 7 new offences under Article III of the 1988 SUA Convention and new provisions authorising the boarding and searching of foreign vessels in international waters who are either suspected of involvement in or are at risk of being targeted by acts prohibited under Article III. Although most IMO delegations expressed support for the amendments, concerns were raised concerning the amendments‚Äô effects on freedom of navigation and the exclusivity of flag state jurisdiction over their vessels within international water. After three years of deliberation, the IMO Legal Committee completed its review during its 90th session during April 2005, with the resulting International Conference on the Revision of the SUA Treaties in October 2005 resulting in the official adoption of the 2005 SUA Protocol. New offences under the protocol included the knowing and intentional weaponisation of ships with terrorist motivation, the knowing and intentional transportation of WMDs and related materials via the high seas both with or without terrorist motivation and the knowing and intentional use of a ship as a transportation means for any person who has committed an offence under any current or future UN terrorism conventions, including the 1988 SUA Convention and the 2005 SUA Protocol. =Piracy- Terrorism Nexus= However, the piracy-terrorism nexus creates a theoretical- legal problem in relation to the legalistic conceptualisation of maritime terrorism outlined above. This nexus involves maritime terrorist acts where the tactic, immediate motive and long-term motive of maritime terrorists are mismatched, showing piratical characteristics over exclusively terrorist ones. These acts include the co-optation of pirates by maritime terrorists to do acts like hijacking and delivering a tanker to maritime terrorists for use as an attack delivery system, meaning the pirates would have indirectly assisted maritime terrorist activities. Other acts include maritime terrorists using piracy to extort and generate funds for their political cause. Both these acts are, tactically speaking, piratical, yet, strategically speaking, of a terrorist nature. Some maritime security analysts, like Peter Chalk, argue that this type of co-operation between pirates and maritime terrorists is implausible on a significant level due to their differing incentives and motives. Others, like Graham Gerard Ong, suggest that pirates and maritime terrorists are remarkably similar due to their transnational nature, similar tactics and weaponry and similar levels of accompanying extreme violence. This legal fuzziness and definitional ambiguity surrounding the legal classification of these illegal activities for prosecution has led to the conception that piracy and maritime terrorism exist on a continuum between each other. The Terrorism Financing Convention partially resolves this legal conundrum posed by the piracy-terrorism nexus for, by intentionally partaking in funding activities for illegal acts under numerous international treaties, including the SUA conventions, one can be prosecuted under the Terrorism Financing Convention. As the treaty punishes intentional collaboration with and enabling of maritime terrorist actors and explicitly mentions terrorism in its title, the treaty effectively punishes offenders as complicit with maritime terrorists. =Maritime Terrorist tactics= Within academic communities, it has been observed that maritime terrorists use an array of tactics in the perpetration of their attacks. There have also been speculations as to how maritime terrorist tactics might evolve in the future. Martin N. Murphy identifies multiple means and tactics historically and currently utilised by maritime terrorists, including boat borne IEDs and naval mines. Within Southeast Asia, this has included: -Suicide bomber divers or ‚Äòhuman torpedoes‚Äô: Multiple attacks of this variant have been attempted within Southeast Asia. Al-Qaeda planned to use suicide bomber divers on US Navy vessels docked in Indonesian ports in 2002. In 2005, an ASG operative by the name Gamal Baharan stated that he had gone to a Palawan island ASG training camp in preparation for an underwater suicide bombing attack that was in the process of being planned by Jemaah Islamiyah. Attacks using a suicide bomber diver or an explosive-laden swimmer delivery vehicle could be used to attack several different types of maritime targets, including warships, naval bases, underwater oil pipelines or underwater telecommunication cables. -Submarines as vehicles of terrorist transportation: There have been two notable instances of terrorist either obtaining or attempting to obtain these capabilities. The first was in 1999 where the Moro Islamic Liberation Front within the Southern Philippines had enquired as to the possibility of purchasing mini-submarines from North Korea. The second was in 2000, where the Tamil Tigers were exposed in the process of building one submarine and three mini-submarines in Phuket, Thailand. Murphy also notes the possibility of certain rarer or unprecedented uses of maritime terrorist tactics being used at sea in the future. These include: -Running an oil tanker aground or sabotaging it in a similar fashion to the M/V Limburg in 2002 to cause intense oil pollution through the leakage, subsequently closing ports or blocking critical chokepoints, like the Malacca Straits. This would cause both regional and global economic losses that would undermine the stability of Southeast Asian states and the international commercial system. -Aerial attacks upon vessels, such as using explosive-laden small aircraft to ram and thus attack the vessel. Murphy, however, judges the chances of an attack like this as highly unlikely. There has also been speculation on the possibility of vessels being used as a delivery system for powerful weapons and devices. Donna Nincic creates a typology for this type of attack between attacks from capacity, where maritime terrorists could use a vessel to deliver a traditional chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear device, and attacks from opportunity, whereby maritime terrorists hijack a vessel carrying dangerous maritime cargo (DMCs) such as LNG, LPG or ammonium nitrate and subsequently weaponise the cargo. However, Murphy casts doubt on the potential for maritime terrorists to use vessels as a delivery system for WMDs or ‚Äòdirty bombs‚Äô, which he judges as incredibly improbable due to the difficulty in assembling such a device and the high risk of mishap in transporting the weapon to its target. Murphy also speculates upon the potential for massive casualty attacks committed using DMCs in a heavily populated area, but suggests that such an attack would be logistically difficult to perpetrate, potentially ineffective and highly detectable to security services. =Motivations for using maritime terrorist tactics= While maritime terrorist actors are obviously driven by political motives in turning to acts of terrorist violence as a central motive, there are deeper, more operational motives behind their target and means selection. For example, Colonel Antonio Guido Monno's work identifies a clear geostrategic motive behind Al-Qaeda's targeting of Western economic vessels and sea lines of communication (SLOCs) as part of a strategy of imposing crippling economic costs on the West to force a Western geopolitical retreat from the Muslim world. Both Chalk, Greenberg and Murphy similarly cover the strategic rationale behind acts like attacking ports and blocking SLOCs with oil tankers to destabilise local states economically and environmentally. All 3 scholars also view a symbolic rationale behind selecting high prestige large civilian targets like cruise ships as attacks of this kind ensures media attention, while striking at a high status target within radical anti-Western ideological frameworks; particularly contemporary jihadism. Thus, there are strategic, political-ideological and symbolic motives behind the use of different maritime terrorist acts. Other operational motives could include the desire to perpetrate a mass casualty or mass hostage-taking attack, which Murphy highlights as a key reason why maritime terrorist would choose to target a large civilian vessel, due to its confined internal environment. An incident like this has already been witnessed in Southeast Asia through the 2004 attack upon the M/V Superferry 14. Notable maritime terrorist hotspots within Southeast AsiaRegional overview= Regionally speaking, Southeast Asia is vulnerable to maritime terrorist attacks for a myriad of reasons. These primarily include: *The importance of the Malacca Straits to international trade during a time when Al-Qaeda is increasingly targeting economic assets. More than 50% of global trade passes through the Malacca Straits. *The presence of regional geographic features, such as ‚Äòchokepoints‚Äô like Malacca, Sunda and Lombok, or archipelagic islands in the Philippines and Indonesia, make attacks upon vessels and hiding from authorities easier for maritime terrorists. The security of vessels transporting energy supplies through Southeast Asian chokepoints has become an increasing energy security concern for many Northeast Asian countries, including China, South Korea and Japan. *The heavy to existential dependency most Southeast Asian states have on uninterrupted maritime trade. *Low rates of cargo inspection brought about by containerisation and lower security standards for cargo heading to Southeast Asia. Only around 1 to 5% of imported cargo containers are inspected. *The trend of most Southeast Asian vessels being registered under primarily Panamanian flags of convenience; with the accompanying lack of transparency and lax regulation this brings. *Security conditions within the region have also been blamed for the region's vulnerability to maritime terrorism. This includes sub-standard coastal surveillance by regional states and regional shipowners‚Äô tendencies to staff their vessels with ‚Äòskeleton crews‚Äô that are more easily overpowered. Low port security has also been attributed to the region's vulnerability to maritime terrorism, for while the US's Container Security Initiative (CSI) has introduced advanced security measures within major regional ports, this only covers cargo heading to the US, not cargo heading to Southeast Asia. Due to these regional factors, multiple potential maritime terrorist threats emanate from the region. According to Bateman, this presents multiple less credible and more credible threats. Improbable forms of attack include: *Weaponising a tanker vessel to block a chokepoint. *Weaponising a tanker vessel to bomb a port. *Using divers to bomb a vessel. More probable forms of attack include: *Bomb attacks against cruise ships or other types of civilian vessels. *Using sea mines to block a chokepoint. *Using boat borne IEDs against vessels, including warships and tankers. Within Southeast Asia there are multiple terrorist factions operating, many of whom subscribe to jihadist ideology. This includes the transnational jihadist organisation Al-Qaeda, whose Asia-Pacific network remained mostly intact in the half-decade following 9/11. Al-Qaeda has built significant connections and provided support to many Southeast Asian militant Islamist and jihadist groups. These include the initially Indonesian-based Jemaah Islamiyah which Al-Qaeda developed into a pan-Asian jihadist network, stretching from Japan in the north to Australia in the south. =Malacca Straits= The two key terrorist organisations that have utilised the sea for terrorist purposes within the Malacca Straits are the Acehnese nationalist Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) movement within Indonesia and the pan-Asian jihadist network of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) which has also maintained a presence around the Straits. = Malacca Straits ‚Äì GAM= GAM fought an insurgency against the Indonesian government from 1976 to 2005, when GAM started ceasefire negotiations with the Indonesian government after the destruction and death brought upon GAM's ranks by the 2004 tsunami. The period from 2002 to 2005 witnessed an increase in kidnap-and-ransom attacks allegedly perpetrated by GAM within the Indonesian waters of the northern Malacca Strait. This increase in kidnappings coincided with majority GAM territorial possession of Aceh, with around 80% of all Acehnese villages falling directly under GAM control. This large number of territorial possessions would theoretically make kidnap-and-ransom attacks easier to execute. GAM developed its naval capabilities out of necessity due to Aceh's maritime geography. GAM used small boats to smuggle weapons from southern Thailand and Malaysia into the Aceh province and smuggle fighters both into and out from Malaysia. Although GAM did not carry out attacks on Indonesian naval vessels blockading Aceh, GAM did use boats as transportation to and from Aceh to deliver and sell cannabis on Batam island within the Malacca Strait to raise funds for their cause. However, the extent of GAM's implication in the increase of kidnap-and-ransom attacks in the early 2000s is disputed. Noel Choong, an International Maritime Bureau (IMB) official, expressed doubt over whether the kidnappings were being perpetrated by GAM or local bandits and criminal elements. Additionally, GAM's exiled central leadership in Sweden has not endorsed kidnap-and-ransom tactics, for they have been trying to generate support among the international community for Acehnese independence. However, testimonies to the IMB from former hostages have given some indication of the involvement of GAM members in these attacks. GAM also seems to derive a significant portion of its funding from kidnap ransoms and drug trafficking. Therefore, it would be more accurate to state that some sections of GAM participate in these acts for their funding, instead of presenting GAM as an organisation involved in maritime terrorism to the same extent as JI or the ASG. Considering this controversy, there are therefore two ways of conceiving of GAM and its involvement in maritime terrorism. One view espoused by Amirell is that GAM is neither a maritime terrorist or ‚Äòpolitical pirate‚Äô organisation due to its lack of affiliation with Al-Qaeda or JI, subsequently viewing kidnap-and-ransom attacks as the behaviours of economically-driven criminal elements within GAM's ranks. However, a second view espoused by Murphy, referring to the piracy-terrorism nexus, notes that insurgent or terrorist groups with political ends sometimes use piratical tactics in the furthering of their political agenda. Therefore, in this view, GAM's Acehnese nationalist political motivations would be contextually important in relation to the piratical acts of individual GAM members. Thus, GAM's rogues would be seen as politically extreme instead of criminal. Below is a list of kidnap-and-ransom attacks where the involvement of GAM members is suspected: -In August 2001, the MV Ocean Silver was attacked by a group of armed assailants with small arms and a grenade launcher while passing the Acehnese east coast in the northern part of the Straits of Malacca. 6 of the crew members, including the ship master, were taken hostage and brought ashore. The remaining 6 crew members were left on board the vessel for three days before being rescued by the Indonesian Navy. The armed assailants allegedly demanded a US$34,000 ransom from the ship owner to release the hostages. The assailants claimed that the ‚Äúfinancial contribution‚Äù of the ransom money would be used to assist the Acehnese nationalist cause. -In February 2004, the Indonesian Navy sank a vessel called the MV Champion XIX, which had been hijacked by a group of assailants. The Indonesian authorities claimed that the hijackers were GAM operatives. =Malacca Straits ‚Äì Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)= Jeemah Islamiyah (JI) is a transnational jihadist terrorist group that was founded in Indonesia during the early 1990s. Their aim is to establish an Islamic state in Southeast Asia that includes southern Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the southern Philippines. They intend to achieve this objective by carving out smaller states within current state borders before unifying these statelets. JI is affiliated with Al-Qaeda and is mostly land-based in its terrorist acts, yet JI has previously shown an interest in attacking vessels in the Straits of Malacca. While their maritime capabilities have remained limited, they have been known to monitor vessels visiting Singaporean naval bases and are suspected of developing maritime expertise. JI has historically used small boats, operated by either themselves or criminal elements, to move across international borders, given their transnational jihadist nature, or smuggle weapons into target countries. Although, as of yet, JI has not perpetrated any maritime terrorist acts, there have been multiple foiled plots where JI had been planning to perpetrate a maritime attack. These include: -In December 2001, the Singapore Internal Security Department arrested 13 JI operatives for planning multiple attacks against Western targets within Singapore. One of these plots included using a boat borne IED to bomb a US Navy vessel while it was passing through the narrowest part of the Johore Strait to minimise the chance of effective evasion. The cell had also been monitoring the patrol route of Singapore's Police Coast Guard. While the plan had first surfaced during the mid-1990s, the Singaporean JI cell had lacked the necessary maritime capabilities to carry out the attack. However, the cell revived the plot in early 2001 after 2 unknown Middle Easterners approached the cell for intelligence regarding US Navy vessels stationed in Singapore. -In August 2004, the head of Indonesia's State Intelligence Agency, Abdullah Makhmud Hendropriyono, declared that captured high-ranking JI operatives had admitted that they had been recently planning attacks against vessels in the Malacca Straits. In the same month, US intelligence officials reported that they had intercepted communications between JI operatives that had exposed a plot to seize a vessel moving through the area by contracting local pirates. The captured vessel was then to be wired with explosives and either used against another vessel, detonated in a port or used as a tool of blackmail against high-traffic and commercially valuable SLOCs. =Southern Philippines= Despite being a hotspot of multiple long-lasting insurgencies, ranging from the Maoist New People's Army to the Islamist Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the most notable Philippines-based terror threat, from a US perspective, has emanated from the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) which was founded by Ustadz Abdurajak Janjalani, a veteran of the Afghan-Soviet war who was radicalised into transnational jihadism during the course of the conflict. Ustadz was a close friend of Osama bin Laden and established ties between the ASG and Al-Qaeda and JI. Under Ustadz, the ASG was a highly organised entity consisting of sophisticated administrative and military structures. Ustadz also operated as the ASG's ideological and theological centre. However, after the killing of Ustadz Janjalani in 1998 by Philippines security forces, the ASG went from being an Al-Qaeda-funded terrorist organisation that was ideologically driven by jihadist goals to a collapsed terrorist organisation that acted more like a criminal gang than a jihadist group in its kidnapping, civilian extortion and drug dealing behaviours, according to Abuza. The ASG also factionalised, with one Basilan island-based faction and one Sulu island-based faction. Ustadz Janjalani's death resulted in the ASG shifting from being predominantly land-based in its conduct to being increasingly maritime-based in its operations due to the land-based counterterrorist measures of the Philippines security service. This shift was additionally helped due to ASG's ownership of maritime equipment and the backgrounds of most ASG operatives being based in local Muslim families with centuries-old maritime traditions. As of 2018, the ASG mostly operated around Jolo, Basilan and Mindanao. In 2013, despite being an Al-Qaeda affiliate funded by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, one of Osama bin Laden's brothers, the ASG shifted their allegiance from Al-Qaeda to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The leader of the group has been identified as Khadaffi Janjalani by the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The group's historic, and contemporary main objective is to achieve an Islamic state in the Southern Philippines, particularly West Mindanao and the Suluwesi Archipelago. The eventual aim of this hypothetical Islamic state is to be incorporated into JI's larger Southeast Asian Islamic state. Beside demanding an independent Moro state, the ASG have also requested for prohibitions against fishing vessels operating in the Sulu Sea. Since the ASG's foundation, it has committed multiple maritime terrorist acts. These include: *On the 10th August 1991, the ASG bombed the M/V Doulous, a motor vessel and foreign missionary ship, in Zamboanga City. 2 Christian missionaries were killed in the blast. This was the ASG's first operation and an early demonstration of their maritime capabilities. *On the 23rd April 2000, the ASG kidnapped 21 tourists from a resort on Sipadan island, a Malaysian island located in the Celebes Sea. The Philippine government eventually resolved the situation by paying a $15 million ransom. *On the 30th September 2000, the ASG kidnapped 3 Malaysians at the Pasir Beach Resort in Sabah, Malaysia using a speedboat. They were eventually rescued by the Philippine military in Talipao, Sulu island. *On the 27th May 2001, the ASG kidnapped 17 Philippine and 3 American nationals from the Dos Palmas beach resort on Palawan island. The ASG operatives covertly entered the resort using a boat, kidnapped their victims from their seaside cabins and transported them to the ASG base on Basilan island. The kidnapping received international notoriety when several of the hostages, including an American national, were beheaded. During a rescue operation by the Philippine's military, 2 more hostages, including another American national, were killed. *In June 2002, the ASG kidnapped multiple foreign nationals, including 4 Indonesian sailors who had been crew abroad the SM88, a coal-carrying vessel that was taking coal from Indonesia to Cebu Island in the Central Philippines. 2 of the sailors managed to escape the ASG following their capture, 1 sailor was rescued and 1 sailor was killed during a Philippine military rescue operation in February 2003. *On the 27th February 2004, the ASG bombed the M/V Superferry 14 in Manila Bay. The bomb started a fire abroad the ferry that trapped the ship's passengers at sea. Out of the 899 people on board, 116 were killed. Although the Philippine government denied the ASG perpetrated the attack, despite the ASG admitted responsibility for the attack, a government investigation concluded that the ASG had in fact perpetrated the attack. *In March 2016, the ASG kidnapped 10 Indonesian sailors from a vessel carrying coal from South Kalimantan. They also kidnapped another 10 Indonesian sailors who had been fishing in Philippine waters. Maritime counterterrorism within Southeast AsiaUnited States= The United States of America and its military has been a key extra-regional power that has become involved in Southeast Asian maritime counterterrorism, particularly following the 9/11 terror attacks. The USA has suggested two major efforts in relation to maritime security, including maritime counterterrorism. The first was the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) which was advocated for by the Bush administration as an agreement by which the US and other PSI participants would cooperate with each other in interdictions against vessels or aircraft from ‚Äòrogue nations‚Äô carrying technologies or material used to create or deliver WMDs. The obligations of PSI participants are, however, based on recommendation and are not legally binding. For this reason, the PSI is referred to in a cooperative operational sense rather than as a multilateral arrangement. Despite the initial involvement of 13 countries in the 5-day interdiction exercise hosted in Singapore during 2005, only 3 Asia-Pacific countries have remained as full participants: Australia, Japan and Singapore. The second was the Regional Maritime Security Initiative (RMSI) which was proposed as a conceptual framework by the US in 2004. It was designed to facilitate in the occurrence of neutral and multilateral maritime security cooperation through intelligence sharing, providing an early warning system regarding transnational maritime threats and assisting law enforcement in monitoring, identifying and interdicting suspicious vessels in national and international waters. The initiative was supposed to focus on maritime security in the Malacca Straits. However, after a 2004 speech by Admiral Fargo in front of the US Congress, Indonesia and Malaysia strongly opposed and rejected the initiative after Admiral Fargo suggested that the US military was looking to deploy special operations forces and Marines with high-speed boats into the Malacca Straits for the purpose of interdiction. However, Singapore welcomed the potential for a U.S presence in the area, viewing it as a stabilising factor from a long- standing Singaporean ally. Due to widespread opposition to the RMSI concept, United States Pacific Command (now United States Indo-Pacific Command) gradually abandoned the concept, with the term ‚ÄòRMSI‚Äô vanishing from the USPACOM's official communications during 2005. =People's Republic of China= The People's Republic of China has been another extra-regional power involved in Southeast Asian maritime security. In 2004, the PRC and ASEAN declared a ‚ÄòMemorandum of Understanding‚Äô in relation to non-traditional security threats, including piracy and terrorism at sea. Within the document, the PRC and ASEAN stated that they would move towards greater cooperation in the fields of informational exchanges, the exchange and training of security personnel, law enforcement cooperation and joint research relating to non- traditional security threats. These areas of cooperation included intelligence sharing, law enforcement capacity building, bilateral legal arrangements and joint security research by the signatories‚Äô experts. In 2005, Guo Xinning, a senior PLA colonel and a visiting researcher at the Institute for Southeast Asian Studies at the time, wrote that maritime terrorism had the potential to become an increasingly serious maritime security threat in the future. Although he believed that Southeast Asia had witnessed relatively sparse evidence of maritime terrorism, he saw some terror groups, particularly JI, as having the intent of launching a large-scale maritime terrorist campaign within the region. =Japan= Japan has partaken in a few capacity building initiatives relating to maritime security within Southeast Asia. During 2002, the Japanese Coast Guard conducted joint exercises with Royal Brunei Marine Police and used the Yashima patrol ship to partake in joint training with Indian Coast Guards, make port calls in Singapore and patrol the Malacca Strait. During 2003, Japan and the Philippines led a training exercise and the Yashima was deployed again in a training exercise with Malaysia. 2003 also witnessed Japan aid Indonesia in drafting a new coast guard code for the country. Although Japan has remained a consistent proponent of joint multilateral patrols, these calls have been historically rejected by Southeast Asian states due to lingering memories of Japanese conduct during World War II. Article IX of Japan's constitution can also be interpreted as restricting the use of defensive Japanese military forces to Japanese citizens and vessels, further complicating and restricting the potential for Japanese maritime security activities in Southeast Asia on an internal legal basis. However, Japan has played a large role in both funding maritime counterterrorist entities and in facilitating multilateral cooperation. Japanese funding has been given to counterterrorism programmes in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore through the ‚ÄòOfficial Development Assistance‚Äô programme. In 2004, the APEC Counter-Terrorist Task Force's ‚ÄòHeads of Asian Coast Guards Agencies Meeting‚Äô was held in Tokyo. In 2005, Japan hosted the ‚ÄúASEAN-Japan Seminar on Maritime Security and Combating Piracy‚Äù in Tokyo where the ASEAN member states evaluated their individual implementation progress of the International Ship and Port Security Code. In terms of multilateral arrangements, there have been 2 proposed arrangements put forth by Japan. The first came in the form of the Ocean Peacekeeping Force (OPF) initiative, that came after Japanese efforts at maritime security capacity building among Malacca Straits littoral states during the 1990s. During the 1999 ASEAN +3 (Japan, South Korea and the PRC) summit, Japanese prime minister Keizo Obuchi proposed the formation of a regional coast guard as a maritime security actor in the Straits of Malacca. The OPF would include multilateral patrols of Japanese, South Korean, Chinese, Malaysian, Indonesian and Singaporean naval forces. However, this proposal was strongly objected to by the PRC who believed that the initiative was designed to extend Japan's East Asian security role and contain the PRC's maritime influence. The second came in the form of the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) initiative, which was adopted in 2004 by 16 states, including all 10 ASEAN members, Japan, South Korea, the PRC, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Under the initiative, signatories may request each other for assistance in detecting and interdicting suspicious vessels and persons while the actual framework itself facilitates in forging cooperative arrangements and enhancing maritime security capacity building. However, the framework does not deal with the means of assistance or the use of maritime force. Voluntarism has been the basis of much of the framework, ranging from information input to funding. =Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)= As a regionalist supranational actor, ASEAN has played a role in maritime security within Southeast Asia. ASEAN has been encouraging its member states to sign and ratify international maritime treaties. From 1997, ASEAN established a high-level Expert Group to draft the ASEAN Plan of Action on Transnational Crime, though the plan was officially adopted in 1999. The document was non-binding but encouraged increased cooperation related to maritime security, including legislative means like ratify international treaties and operational means like capacity building activities and the establishment of an ASEAN Centre for Transnational Crime (ACTC). In the 10th ARF ministerial meeting during 2003, a statement that pertained to maritime security was made following the meeting. This included a declaration that all ASEAN member states would try to implement international maritime treaties, including the SUA 1988 treaties. But, to date, only Singapore, Brunei, Myanmar, the Philippines and Vietnam have become SUA 1988 signatories, with the two other Malacca Straits littoral states of Malaysia and Indonesia not being SUA 1988 signatories. In 2004, the ARF's Statement on Strengthening Transport Security against International Terrorism was adopted, which advocated for the full implementation of the IMO's International Ship and Port Security Code by ARF participants as a countermeasure to the threat of maritime terrorism. Although ARF participants have partaken in regional maritime security capacity building and operations with one another though, as of yet, not under an ARF organisational framework. Examples of this include the ‚ÄòEyes in the Sky‚Äô (EiS) initiative in 2005. This was done by Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore to create a maritime domain awareness (MDA) network in the Strait of Malacca. This arrangement had been preceded by a Singaporean- Indonesian cooperative system that aimed to create a real-time surveillance system over the Strait of Singapore. As part of the initiative, each country allocates maritime patrol aircraft to run 2 sorties per week along the Malacca and Singapore Straits. Each flight carries a maritime patrol team that consists of military personnel from the 3 countries. In 2004, following a precipitous increase in maritime attacks within the straits, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore also launched the MALSINDO trilateral naval patrols. Similarly to the EiS initiative, these patrols were confined in their area of operation to the Malacca and Singapore Straits and outside an ASEAN framework. MALSINDO patrols were coordinated in the sense that maritime patrols were only responsible for patrolling their own territorial waters, remained under separate national military commands with limited powers of ‚Äòhot pursuit‚Äô into the sovereign waters of other participating countries. In 2006, the EiS was renamed into the ‚ÄòMalacca Straits Patrols‚Äô (MSP) initiative after new standard operating procedures were signed by the participating countries to improve the operational effectiveness of naval and maritime air patrols. While, in a 2005 ARF workshop, a large number of participating countries supported the intensification of the role of the ‚ÄòFive Powers Defence Arrangement‚Äô in regional maritime security matters, as well as the continuation of coordinated patrols, there was still no consensus in support of joint patrols. As part of ensuring maritime security within Southeast Asia, ASEAN has fulfilled a role in facilitating defence dialogues with key extra-regional powers. The ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) run the ADMM+ scheme that aims to construct an international deliberative framework for maritime security. This is done to assist in the tasks of goal setting and coordinated actions within the framework of the ADMM. =International Maritime Organisation (IMO)= In response to the 9/11 attacks, the IMO wished to revise their countermeasures against maritime violence and crime. Following a 2002 Diplomatic Conference at the IMO HQ, the International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) Code was incorporated as a new chapter under the SOLAS treaty, giving it the force of international law. The ISPS Code aimed to create a consistent standard upon which SOLAS-contracting governments could evaluate and manage risk to vessels and port facilities and, accordingly, instate appropriate security measures should the levels of maritime threat change. The code covers passenger and cargo vessels (including tankers) of 500 gross tonnage or above as well as port facilities harbouring vessels on international voyages and offshore drilling platforms. The code legally imposed obligations on contracting governments, vessels (including the ship master), shipping companies and port facilities. ISPS Code includes two parts. Part A provides mandatory security requirements for contracting governments, port facilities and shipping companies while Part B contains implementation guidelines regarding Part A requirements. Both vessels and port facilities must control and monitor access to their domain, monitor human activity and cargo within their domain and maintain functional security communication. There are 3 security levels varying in threat severity due to the diverse security needs of vessels and ports and the fluid nature of maritime threat over time. It is the contracting governments‚Äô responsibility to provide vessels and ports with security levels and to communicate security information to the relevant vessels, port facilities and the IMO (which the IMO uses to facilitate effective communication between ship companies/vessel security officers and port security officers). Ship companies are obliged to install an Automatic Identification System (AIS) on their vessels, make sure their vessels present their IMO Ship Identification Number externally and internally, make sure they maintain an onboard ship security system and make sure each of their vessels obtains a Ship Security Certificate to demonstrate that their vessel complies with the ISPS Code. Each shipping company must appoint a Company Security Officer (CSO) and Ship Security Officers (SSOs) for each of their vessels while each state must appoint Port Security Officers (PSOs) once the contracting government or relevant security authority has conducted initial port facility risk assessments to determine which port facilities require a PSO. It is then the responsibility of SSOs and PSOs to undertake ship and port facility security assessments, organise ship and port security arrangements and plans (which must be approved by each vessel's administration or contracting government, respectively) and actively monitor their security situation. Although, globally, 89.5% of 9,000 declared port facilities had port facility security plans and 90% of relevant ships possessed a Ship Security Certificate as of 2004, several flaws can be identified with the code at a Southeast Asian regional level. Firstly, as the treaty only applies to 500 gross tonnage vessels on international voyages, the code does not cover fishing vessels, ships under 500 gross tonnage or domestic trade merchant ships. Both Indonesia and the Philippines possess large fishing fleets, high quantities of small trading vessels and large domestic commercial fleets. This means that many vessels in the region are not held to the ISPS‚Äô standards, including maritime terrorists like the ASG who overwhelmingly use small high- speed boats. Secondly, due to the heavily US-endorsed and supported nature of the ISPS Code, the code places difficulties upon developing countries, like countries within Southeast Asia. In the view of Sam Bateman, many developing countries would rather give higher spending priority to domestic issues like economic development rather than maritime terrorism countermeasures that, in the final analysis, benefit Western interests over domestic ones. US threats to deny entry to non-compliant ships, thus making ISPS Code compliance a pre- condition for trading with the US, are subsequently seen as an abuse of international power. Therefore, there are multiple economic implementation costs that developing Southeast Asian states might not be willing to pay. The ISPS Code also faces some effective enforcement issues, like most international laws. While the IMO monitors compliance, the flag state's efficiency in administratively establishing the code's arrangements and ensuring the actual compliance of vessels under its maritime jurisdiction determines ultimate compliance. Therefore, arrangements that flag states report as being in place may not be operationally effective. Given the developing nature of many Southeast Asian states, administrative issues might frustrate its implementation. Additionally, the IMO has been working with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to make it harder for terrorists to use vessels as transportation for their operatives. With over 1.3 million international seafarers, it has been suggested that seafarer identification documents that use biometrics ought to be introduced. The Seafarers‚Äô Identity Documents Convention of 2003 only requires 2 ratifying state signatories to enter into force. However, multiple concerns have been raised by states regarding it, ranging from its requirement for visa-free entry to infrastructural problems relating to distribution, identity verification and maintenance of national databases. =Other maritime security entities= In response to the rise of non-traditional maritime threats in Southeast Asia, like maritime terrorism, forms of multilateral cooperation between different regional states have been used for maritime counterterrorist purposes. Within Southeast Asia, initially nationally based Coastal Watch System (CWS) initiatives, primarily in the Philippines, developed national maritime domain awareness (MDA) networks through comprehensive levels of inter-agency cooperation. When the Philippines‚Äô CWS was connected with similar systems based in Malaysia and Indonesia, a sub-regional MDA network was created within the wider multilateral Asia-Pacific system, including the Singapore-based Information Fusion Centre (IFC). This Asia-Pacific system is coordinated by the Maritime Research Information Centre (MRIC) based in Manilla, who provide regional maritime threat assessments for Southeast Asia and possess some surveillance capabilities through an Automated Information System (AIS). As main functions, MDA networks are responsible for the circulation of maritime incident reports, participation in active maritime tracking and, when necessary, the circulation of sensitive maritime information within relevant maritime security networks. The IFC MDA centre is primarily funded by the Singaporean government. After being founded in 2009, the IFC aims to develop a shared overview of Southeast Asian maritime security involving multiple maritime security concerns, including the occurrence of maritime terrorism. Operating out of Changi naval base, the centre is staffed by the Singaporean navy and liaison officers from around 15 countries, with 23 countries having signed bilateral agreements with the Singaporean state regarding the IFC. As its main capabilities, the IFC's liaison system allows for rapid information sharing and analysis, while its Open and Analysed Shipping Information System (OASIS) allows for active monitoring of vessels and maritime situations using AIS, LRIT and information relayed through the system's mobile app. The IFC also serves a capacity building role by facilitating in the training of regional and international security practitioners. Given the potential future technological innovations and applications of satellite and aerial drone technology, the monitoring and surveillance abilities of entities like the IFC is likely to increase in its effectiveness, suggesting they may become increasingly important in maritime security affairs. Since the end of the Cold War, American and European private military and security companies (PMSC) have been offering maritime security services within Southeast Asia. In the case of Indonesia, the port of Belawan has had its port security provided by local PMSCs who are hired by ship owners or state-run port management companies. Many of these local PMSCs have connections to the Indonesian military through their owners.

Early life Roberts was born on March 22, 1813 in New York City. He was the son of Welsh born Dr. Owen Roberts and Mrs. (n√©e Newell) Roberts, who was from Birmingham, England. His father, who came to New York in 1798, died four years after Marshall was born. Roberts received a common school education in New York City where he \\"was characterized by his strong common sense, his natural shrewdness, his pluck, and his boldness.\\" Career Calvary Church, in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. Thomas Nast cartoon of the \\"White-washing Committee\\" (L‚ÄìR: John Jacob Astor, Moses Taylor, Roberts), . Roberts was \\"one of the foremost businessman of his day.\\" He was a leader in gigantic railroads and operated and built steamships, including the Hendrick Hudson, the largest steam vessel navigating the Hudson River at that time. He started his career, however, as a ship chandler at 36 West Street in 1833. Roberts was aided in his career by Robert C. Wetmore (a Whig) and Prosper Wetmore (a Democrat), wealthy brothers who \\"possessed great political influence\\" and became his friends and mentors. When the Democrats were in charge, Prosper was a Naval Officer and when the Whigs came into power, Prosper was compelled to give up the chair to Robert who succeeded him. When John Tyler became president in 1841, the brothers secured a contract for naval supplies for the Port of New York for Roberts. In this role, he \\"acted honestly by the Government, furnishing precisely the goods called for, in quality and quantity,\\" which became the foundation of his wealth. He soon added cargo ships to his fleet and began a merchant shipping business. With the Wetmores and financier George Law, he established the U.S. Mail Steamship Company in 1848 to assume the contract to carry the U.S. mail from New York City, with stops in New Orleans and Havana, to the Isthmus of Panama for delivery in San Francisco. When the Pacific Mail Steamship Company established a competing line to the U.S. Mail Steamship Company between New York City and Chagres in 1850, they placed an opposition steamers in the Pacific running from Panama to San Francisco. The rivalry ended in April 1851 when an agreement was made between the companies whereby the U.S. Mail Steamship Company purchased the Pacific Mail steamers on the Atlantic side and Law sold his ships and new line to the Pacific Mail, of which Law was president and Roberts was a stockholder and director. In 1854, Roberts purchased Law's interest and began his service as president of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1860, when the contract with the government expired, Roberts withdrew from the California business, leaving it to Pacific Mail, and set up the North Atlantic Steamship Company to control the business on the East Coast. After Cornelius Vanderbilt established the Accessory Transit Company to compete on the West Coast, Pacific made the same arrangement with Vanderbilt that it had formerly made with Roberts. After the Civil War ended, he used his idle steamers to compete with Vanderbilt and Pacific Mail, however, Vanderbilt was too strong and he quickly sold his steamers to the old Nicaraguan Company and gave up the steamship business forever. He was one of the first directors of the Erie Railroad and one of the first investors in the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Texas roads. He was also one of the earliest investors in the Pennsylvania coal mines. For several years, he served as president of the North River Bank of New York. He was one of the projectors of the Long Dock Company and he established the Atlantic Cable Company with Peter Cooper and Cyrus West Field. =U.S. Civil War= After the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861 which started the Civil War, Roberts sent his steamer, the Star of the West, to Union Army Major Robert Anderson loaded with provisions, although it returned full to New York after the Fort fell. Roberts then offered to put his entire fortune into U.S. Bonds to help sustain the Government's credit during the U.S. Civil War. The \\"bonds were quoted at 90,\\" which Roberts purchased from the Government, eventually making a colossal return on his investment. When the government needed steamers for transport, he either leased or sold many of his to the Union. He also received several large naval supply contracts, all of which helped increase his massive fortune by ten-fold by the War's end. =Involvement with politics= In 1852, as a Henry Clay Whig, Roberts made his first appearance in politics as the party's nominee for U.S. Congress in the 7th District (which comprised the 9th, 16th, and 20th Wards), losing to Democratic candidate William Adams Walker. In 1865, he was the Union Party's candidate for Mayor of New York City and was endorsed by the War Democrats. He lost to Bourbon Democrat candidate John T. Hoffman, the Recorder of New York City who became Governor of New York after his term as mayor. He was active in the Republican party, financing the party, and serving as delegate to its first National Convention in Philadelphia in 1856. Roberts ran for office several times, but was unsuccessful each time. Personal life Vanity Fair. Roberts was married three times. In 1830, Roberts was married to his first wife, Catherine Dodge Amerman (1813‚Äì1845). Before her death, they were the parents of: * Isaac K. Roberts (1835‚Äì1888), who worked with his father. * Mary Matilda Roberts (1836‚Äì1919), who died unmarried. * Marshall Owen Roberts Jr. (1843‚Äì1865), who died unmarried. On November 17, 1847, he remarried to Caroline Danforth Smith (1827‚Äì1874), a daughter of Norman Smith Jr. and Caroline (n√©e Danforth) Smith of Hartford, Connecticut. Her elder sister, Mary Boardman Smith, was the wife of abolitionist William Weston Patton (fifth president of Howard University). Caroline, a friend of President Abraham Lincoln, founded at least four benevolent societies in New York City. By 1857, they lived at 107 Fifth Avenue at the southeast corner of 18th Street. Before her death, they were the parents of: * Caroline Marshall Roberts (1849‚Äì1893), who married sculptor Ames Van Wart (1841‚Äì1927), a grandson of Henry van Wart (brother-in-law of Washington Irving) in 1869. His third marriage was in 1875 to Sarah Lawrence \\"Susan\\" Endicott (1840‚Äì1926), a daughter of John Endicott of Salem, Massachusetts (descendants of John Endecott, the longest-serving governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony). After their marriage, Susan threw a lavish reception at their Fifth Avenue home on December 16, 1879, which included the Vanderbilts, Beeckmans, Agnews, Astors, Townsends, Van Rensselaers and Pierreponts. Before his death, they were the parents of: * Marshall Owen Roberts (1878‚Äì1931), who became a British subject and later married Irene Helen Murray (b. 1882), a daughter of Sir George Murray (grandson of George Murray Bishop of Rochester) and granddaughter of Lord Dunleath, in 1903. They divorced in 1921. Roberts died from a stroke on September 11, 1880 at the United States Hotel in Saratoga, New York. After a funeral at Calvary Church, where his pallbearers included William M. Evarts, Hamilton Fish, Peter Cooper, Edwards Pierrepont, Henry G. Stebbins, Percy R. Pyne, Samuel Sloan and Edward N. Dickerson, he was buried in the Roberts family vault at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx. The New York Times estimated his fortune at $10 million at the time of his death. After his death, his widow remained involved in the New York social scene, before her remarriage to Ralph Vivian in 1892. They moved to London and she leased the Fifth Avenue mansion to Cornelius and Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt while they were building their chateau on upper Fifth Avenue. She died in London on March 22, 1926. =Art collection= Roberts was a noted art collector and staunch supporter of American artists who never sold or exchanged a painting after he bought it. He was considered the prototypical New York patron, like Gilpin in Philadelphia and Harrison Gray Otis in Boston. He \\"made no pretensions to connoisseurship, but was guided in his purchases simply by fancy, or with a view to assisting some needy artist.\\" At the time of his death, it was reported that he had spent $600,000 on his collection that was then worth over $750,000. His best- known acquisition is Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, which he bought for $10,000 (at the time, an enormous sum). In the art galleries at his Fifth Avenue home, he displayed his collection, which included Rembrandt Peale's Babes in the Wood, Daniel Huntington's Venice and Old Lawyer, Frederick Stuart Church's Rainy Season in the Tropics, Paul Delaroche's Napoleon at Fontainbleau, Ernest Meissonier's The Smoker (1849) Thomas Sidney Cooper's Monarch of the Plain, √âdouard Fr√®re's The Industrious Mother, John Frederick Kensett's Moon by the Sea Shore, Henry Peters Gray's Rose of Fiesole and Just Fifteen, George A.

Starting July 24, the strike involved over 400 members of the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific, with the main causes of the strike being issues regarding scheduling, working conditions, and wage increases. The strike ended on August 2 following Federal mediation, with a compromise agreement between the union and ferry service.  Background  The Alaska Marine Highway (AMH) is a ferry service operated by the U.S. state of Alaska. Along with the state capital of Juneau, the AMH services many areas of Alaska where the only means of transportation is by air travel or sea travel, such as Kodiak Island. The largest union representing workers on the AMH is the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific (IBU), an affiliated union of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents approximately 430 ferry workers. In 2017, the employment contract between the union and AMH expired, with union members continuing to work under interim agreements as the union and AMH entered negotiations for new contracts. However, negotiations stalled as neither side could come to an agreement over issues including scheduling, wage increases, and working conditions. In particular, the union sought a 9% annual wage increase spread out over three years, as well as increased state funding for workers' health insurance and the elimination of a rule that allowed the AMH to pay out-of-state workers less than Alaskans. By July 2019, with no agreement reached under either Governors Bill Walker or Mike Dunleavy, the union moved towards a strike. A 2019 contract proposal by the state government that did not include wage increases was rejected by union members, who then voted to authorize a strike. On July 23, the government of Alaska sent a letter to IBU officials stating that a strike by the state employees would most likely not be protected under state collective bargaining laws, with union officials responding that they were acting legally. On July 24, the union announced a strike. This was the first strike experienced by the AMH since a 20-day strike by the IBU in 1977.  Course of the strike  On July 24, about 420 union members walked off their post. Pilots and engineers, represented by the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots and the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association, respectively, did not participate in the strike, but agreed to not cross picket lines for the duration of the strike. On July 26, 2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders voiced their support for the strikers. On July 27, union and state officials met with an arbitrator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to discuss an end to the strike. However, by July 29, the mediator had suspended discussions. On August 3, an agreement between the two parties was reached, with representatives of the state announcing a return to operations starting the next day.  Outcomes  Over the course of the strike, over 8,500 passengers and almost 2,500 vehicles were affected. The strike cost the AMH between $3.2 and $3.3 million in lost revenue and reimbursements to customers. As part of the agreement, the IBU and AMH agreed to a three-year labor contract that included a 3% pay increase spread over 2020 and 2021. Union members would start paying into their health insurance programs starting in 2021, with increased coverage. Additionally, union members would no longer be required to pay out-of-pocket for hotel rooms while working. However, the union failed to amend the rule allowing the AMH to pay out-of-state workers less than Alaskan residents.

Nemours filed multiple attempts to get their hospital approved and even discussed buying Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children but state officials did not see the need for another children's hospital. Nemours then started an aggressive advertising campaign talking about wanting to bring a nationally recognized children's hospital to the Orlando region. After many attempts to get their project greenlighted by state officials, Nemours was approved. Construction of the hospital began on February 25, 2009 and was managed by architectural firm Skanska and designed by a collaboration of Stanley Beaman, Sears Atlanta Perkins, Will Boston. The new children's hospital is a part of the Nemours Foundation and cost $397 million. The hospital is 630,000 square feet and has a maximum bed capacity of 137 beds, with only 95 operating. In 2016 a new Ronald McDonald House with 15 bedrooms opened up adjacent to NCH with free transportation to and from the hospital. In 2017 hospital administration announced that they would be expanding up into their 6th floor, adding 30 patient beds. In addition to 30 inpatient beds, the expansion also adds an operating room and cardiac catheterization lab. The expansion was completed in early 2020. Services The hospital offers inpatient, outpatient, and rehabilitation services as well as a children's clinic and emergency department on the 60 acre campus. Notable features of the new hospital include all private rooms, expanded storage spaces, and technologies to secure patient rooms and entertain patients. Awards In 2013 the hospital attained a LEED Gold certification due to the advanced environmental design. The hospital was the first in Florida to obtain the status, and the third children's hospital in the U.S. to be LEED Gold certified. In 2013, the hospital was listed as one of the \\"Most Wired\\" hospitals in the U.S. by the Hospitals and Health Networks magazine. In 2015 the hospital was ranked on the list of \\"The 50 Most Amazing Children‚Äôs Hospitals in the World\\" by Healthcare Administration DP. In 2019 the hospital was one of three children's hospitals in Florida to earn \\"Top Children's Hospital\\" status from The Leapfrog Group, and has earned the recognition for multiple years.

Life and work  Obituary in the Philadelphia Times, January 13, 1887 Frankel came from a Jewish family with a long tradition of musicians based in Gr√ºnstadt in the Palatinate which was then part of the French Empire, and was the son of Joseph and Dorothe Fr√§nkel. With his two brothers he undertook concert tours, including to neighboring Alsace. Frankel, at the time of Rabbi Leopold Roos, became cantor at his Gr√ºnstadt home synagogue, and in 1844 he moved to Mainz.Arnold Vogt: Religion im Milit√§r, 1984, S. 719, ; (Ausschnittscan zur T√§tigkeit als Kantor an den Synagogen Gr√ºnstadt und Mainz)K√∂niglich bayerisches Amts- und Intelligenzblatt f√ºr die Pfalz, S. 878 des Jahrgangs 1844; (Digitalscan) In 1848 he emigrated to the United States. From 1848 to a year before his death, Frankel served as the cantor and leader of the Rodeph Shalom Congregation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The congregation was a community of Ashkenazi Reform Judaism which had been founded in 1795. He was known as the \\"sweet singer of Israel.\\" =Military career= Frankel was appointed the first official Jewish chaplain in the United States Armed Services on September 18, 1862, by President Abraham Lincoln. He was also the first non-Christian to be appointed as a chaplain. Until his appointment, the law required a chaplain to be ordained by a \\"Christian denomination.\\" After Rabbi Arnold Fischel was elected to serve as chaplain-designate for the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment, as a test case as opposed to their prior un-ordained minister, the Secretary of War Simon Cameron (for whom the regiment was named, \\"Cameron‚Äôs Dragoons\\") denied the request. This denial led to the Board of Delegates of American Israelites and Fischel to lobby to change the law. Fischel also met with President Lincoln who was in favor of changing the law. Once the law was changed, Lincoln appointed Frankel as the first Jewish chaplain. Frankel served in the military hospitals of Philadelphia which was a center of care for the war wounded. He held this post until mid-1865 and was discharged from the military at that time. =Death= Frankel died in Philadelphia in 1887 as a widower, leaving two sons and two daughters. Isaak Fr√§nkel, one of his brothers, died on December 20, 1877, in Gr√ºnstadt at the age of 74 after serving as a cantor for the synagogue there for over 50 years.Synagoge Gr√ºnstadt bei Alemannia JudaicaEd Davis: The history of Rodeph Shalom Congregation, Philadelphia, 1802‚Äì1926, 1926, S. 98 u. 99, (Ausschnittscans)  Commemoration  During the torpedoing and sinking of the in 1943, four American military chaplains, including a Jewish chaplain, sacrificed themselves and died in the performance of their duties. In commemoration of this, a medal was designed by the American sculptor Eugene Daub and issued by the Jewish-American Hall of Fame, the Four Chaplains' Medal.

Name  Confusion exists over the origin of the bay's name. In 1794, during the Vancouver Expedition, Captain George Vancouver of the British Royal Navy named a bay in the area \\"Hoods Bay,\\" probably in honor of Admiral Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood.

History From 1982 to 1988, Joe Davidoski worked in sales for Dun & Bradstreet, a publicly traded company that, at the time, had a 90% market share of the credit-check market. Davidoski was recognized as one of the company's top salesmen. After raising concerns internally for several years, in June 1988, a day after the enactment of Ohio's Whistleblower Statute, Davidoski sent a letter to management detailing the misleading and unethical nature of the company's selling practices. The story of his employer's alleged misconduct made front-page news, and Davidoski was featured on American news programs, including 20/20. Davidoski's complaints led to several lawsuits and inquiries, including one by the United States Postal Service. In June 1989, Dun & Bradstreet agreed to settle a number of these for $18 million. In 1989, Davidoski left and formed Kreller, Inc., today known as Kreller Companies.

Course The river begins as several small streams in the area around the Kumirakatti forest reserve about 9 km west of Karumalai village. The stream progresses east past Karumalai and Tovarankurichchi, where it turns to the northeast. South of Kodumbalur, it receives the surplus flow of the Vembar retention basin and returns to its southeastern course. Near the village of Kummankudi, it is joined on its right bank by its largest tributary, the Nerunjikudiyar River, which flows for about 30 km east and originates from a retention basin in Thirumayam taluk. The Vellar then curves to the east for a short distance, passing to the south of Pudukkottai. At the village of Kadayakudi, it is joined on its left bank by its second largest tributary, the Gundar River, which flows for about 7.5 km southeast through Pudukkottai and originates from the Kavinadu retention basin to the west of that city. After this confluence, it turns southeast again, passing by Arimalam and Aranthangi. After it passes Avudaiyarkoil, it turns to the east, continuing to where it empties into the sea northeast of Manamelkudi at Mumpalai village in Manamelkudi taluk, where it forms a small estuary. The river, which runs for a total length of flows through parts of Dindigul, Tiruchirappalli, and Pudukkottai districts. Within Pudukkottai district, it forms part of the border between Illuppur, Pudukkottai, and Alangudi taluks on its left bank, and Ponnamaravathi and Thirumayam taluks on its right bank. Basin The river's drainage basin is located between makes up the southern and westernmost part of the Agniyar basin, one of Tamil Nadu's 17 major river basins, which is bounded to the north by the Kaveri basin and to the south by the Pambar basin. Two other rivers‚Äô sub-basins, those of the Ambuliyar and Agniyar, border to the northeast and northwest of Vellar's watershed respectively, and make up the rest of the Agniyar basin. The river's sub-basin covers 2034 km2 of land mostly in Dindigul, Tiruchirappalli, and Pudukkottai districts, although smaller areas in Sivaganga and Thanjavur districts are also within the watershed. In 2007, the sub-basin was inhabited by about 805,000 people. Irrigation and flow The Vellar River is extensively dammed in order to draw from the river, mostly for agricultural purposes such as irrigation, although it is also used to supply water for industrial and domestic demand. Along its course, the river is dammed 17 times, and water from it is diverted to a total of 161 storage tanks/retention basins with an approximate total capacity of 270 million cubic meters, and to 13,213 acres of farmland. Total demand consistently exceeds total potential, resulting in annual water deficits which prevent the river from actually discharging into the sea. Surplus flow in the Vellar was last recorded in 1993, with a registered volume of 446 million cubic meters. Compared to the nearby Agniyar and Ambuliyar rivers, which do consistently reach the sea during each year's wet season, the Vellar lacks significant tributaries towards its mouth such as the Maharajasamundram, the main tributary of the Agniyar River, which joins the Agniyar only a short distance from where it discharges. In comparison, the Nerunjikudiyar and Gundar rivers are much smaller and further upstream.

It includes one species, Overoraptor chimentoi.  Etymology  The generic name Overoraptor is derived from the Spanish overo, meaning piebald, in reference to the color of the fossil bones. The specific name, O. chimentoi, refers to Roberto Nicol√°s Chimento, who discovered the remains.  Description and classification  Although the holotype is very fragmentary, it exhibits an unusual combination of features that reveal a novel phylogenetic position. The forelimb exhibits a bird-like morphology that includes, among other things, a robust ulna, while the hindlimb appears to have been adapted for a cursorial lifestyle. A \\"sickle-claw\\" similar to that of dromaeosaurs is also present. Both a flight-adapted forelimb and a cursorial hindlimb are present in Rahonavis, also from Gondwana, and the describers suggest the two are closely related taxa. The describers ran a phylogenetic analysis and recovered a novel position for Overoraptor and Rahonavis, being outside of Unenlagiidae and Avialae, to which the latter has sometimes been assigned to. Their cladogram is shown below, with clade names added by definition:  Paleoenvironment  Overoraptor was found in the Huincul Formation, a geological unit that has been extensively studied in recent years. Overoraptor lived alongside theropods such as the noasaurid Huinculsaurus, abelisaurids like Skorpiovenator, Ilokelesia and Tralkasaurus, carcharodontosaurids like Mapusaurus and indeterminate theropods like Gualicho and Aoniraptor.

He is known as the discoverer in 1921 of the amino acid methionine and as the co- developer, with Jane Hinton, of the eponymous Mueller-Hinton agar. Biography J. Howard Mueller was the son of a Unitarian clergyman and grew up in Illinois. He studied biology at Illinois Wesleyan University with a bachelor's degree in 1912. He was then a chemistry instructor at the University of Louisville for two years before receiving his master's degree in 1914. He became interested in pathology and bacteriology and in 1914 attended a summer course at the Medical Faculty of Columbia University. He stayed there for further studies after receiving a scholarship and received in 1916 his doctorate Ph.D. in pathology. He then became an assistant pathologist at the New York Presbyterian Hospital. In 1917 he was a volunteer at the front in France with a medical unit and was involved in empirical proof of the transmission of trench fever by lice. In 1919 he was discharged as a lieutenant and became an instructor in bacteriology under Hans Zinsser at Columbia University. (The academic position to which Mueller was appointed was formerly held by J. Gardner Hopkins, who was promoted.) At Columbia, Mueller did research on the requirements for the growth of cultures of pathogenic bacteria. (See pages 314-321 for a bibliography of Mueller's publications.) He wrote: He was the first to succeed in isolating and characterizing methionine, which certain streptococci needed for their growth. In 1923 when Zinnser was appointed as the chair of the department of bacteriology and immunology at Harvard Medical School, Mueller followed him and became an assistant professor there. However, Mueller had to interrupt his work on bacterial metabolism, including work on Rous sarcoma virus with a dispute over William Ewart Gye's theory. In 1930 Mueller began his studies on the nutritional requirements of the diphtheria bacillus. His work with the diphtheria pathogen was also of practical importance for the development of vaccines against diphtheria (by optimizing the bacterial cultures). From the early 1940s, he turned to research om the tetanus pathogen. After Zinsser's death in 1940, Mueller became head of the bacteriology department at Harvard. He continued to do research. Ge arrived several hours early at his laboratory and experimented until his co-workers arrived in the morning, then gave the research to his assistant Pauline Miller so that could devoted himself to administrative work). In addition to basic research, he always aimed at medical applications to fight infectious agents. In 1944 when Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty published their research on bacterial DNA, Mueller understood the meaning and importance of their results and published his viewpoint in 1945 in a review article. Mueller was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1945.

The line operates every 15‚Äì20 minutes during the weekday peak hours, 24 minutes during the weekday midday, and 30‚Äì35 minutes during the late nights and weekends. Route P6 trips are roughly 65 minutes long. Background Route P6 operates daily between Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station and Anacostia station, running into Downtown and providing service to Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest. Select early morning and late night trips would begin/end at Archives station. Other select trips will begin/end at McKinley Technology High School during school days. Route P6 currently operates out of Shepherd Parkway division. Prior to 2012, the route would operate out of Bladensburg division. History Prior to the Anacostia‚ÄìEckington Line, routes P1, P2, and P4 operated under former routes. It goes as the following: * Route P1 originally operated as the Petworth-Potomac Park Line operating between Pethworth and Potomac Park. It was later renamed route 61 and later discontinued in the 1990s after Georgia Avenue‚ÄìPetworth station and the Green Line portion in inner DC opened. * Route P2 operated as the Petworth Line operating between Pethworth and Takoma station alongside route P7 which operated between Takoma station and Federal Triangle. The line was later renamed route 62 (P2) and 67 (P7). * Route P4 operated as the 11th Street Line operating along 11th Street between Decatur and Illinois streets in Brightwood Park, and Federal Triangle until Anacostia station opened. * Route P5 was discontinued several years prior to the 1990s. On December 28, 1991, routes P1, P2, P4, P5, and a new route P6 was created as a new line called the Anacostia‚ÄìEckington Line to provide service from Anacostia and Downtown in order to replace the A2, A4, A6, and A8 between Anacostia and Archives station which were rerouted to Anacostia station. Route P1 operated between Anacostia station and Potomac Park (State Department) during the weekday peak-hours only. Route P2 operated between Anacostia and Archives station during the weekdays only. Routes P4, P5, and P6 operated between Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station, Archives station, and Metro Center station. Routes P4, P5, and P6 will run along the B6 routing between Rhode Island Avenue and Metro Center. Routes P1 and P2 would primarily operate along M Street SE/SW, Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 4th Street, North Capitol Street while routes P4, P5, and P6 would operate a similar routing with routes P1 and P2 but operate along Capitol Hill via Virginia Avenue, 3rd Street, E Street, Washington Avenue, and C Street with route P1 primarily operating along Pennsylvania Avenue. =1990s Changes= During the mid to late 1990s, routes P4, P5, and P6 were merged into one route as route P6 which will operate between Anacostia station and Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station on a combination of the B6, P4, and P5 routing. =Proposed Changes= During WMATA's FY2011 budget year, it was proposed to eliminate all route P2 service as it duplicates to route P1 and P6. A year later during the FY2012 budget, WMATA proposed to restructure the Anacostia‚ÄìEckington Line. WMATA proposed to eliminate both routes P1 and P2 and reroute P6 along M Street SE/SW and C Street. This was because there was low ridership to the State Department, through Capitol Hill, and on late night Friday and Saturday trips, poor on-time performance and unreliable service due to outdated schedules, focus service on high ridership areas and emerging markets, and a planned closure of C Street SW and CSX tunnel project on Virginia Avenue will require to reroute P6. =2012 Changes= On June 17, 2012, routes P1 and P2 were discontinued and replace by route P6. Route P6 was also rerouted along M Street SE/SW instead of Virginia Avenue, and via Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue instead of 13th Street, SE to align with the new 11th Street Bridge. =2016 Changes= On June 26, 2016, route P6 was converted into a 24-hour bus stop in order to replace the A42, A46, and A48. The early morning and late night P6 trips will only operate between Anacostia station and Archives station. =2017 Changes= Beginning on June 25, 2017, routes P6 and M31 (McKinley Tech High School Line) were merged into route P6 as it would be easier to operate the line under one name. Route P6 will have select trips operated from McKinley Tech High School during the school days only.

He is described as a coming from Petra in Arabia by the Suda, a ninth-century Byzantine encyclopaedia, but as coming from Syria by Eunapius. This is not necessarily a contradiction, since urban Arabs frequently identified as Syrian. The Suda calls another sophist, Callinicus of Petra, both a Syrian and an Arabian., citing , but contrasts Eunapius' descriptions of Epiphanius as Syrian and Diophantus as Arab. Epiphanius was the son of a certain Ulpian, probably not the same person as the sophist Ulpian of Antioch.Suda Online: Œµ2741. The Suda entry was copied in the Ionia of Eudokia Makrembolitissa. He was a pupil of Julian of Cappadocia. That Epiphanius was a pagan is known from an incident in Laodicea, where he was on close terms with two prominent local Christians, Apollinarius the Elder and his son, Apollinarius the Younger.The incident is recorded by Socrates of Constantinople and Sozomen and the identity of the Laodicean Epiphanius with the Athenian is made explicit by the Suda, see and . Sometime between 328 and 335 they attended one of his lectures. According to custom, Epiphanius dismissed the \\"uninitiated and profane\\" (a cue to Christians to leave) before reciting a hymn to Dionysus. The Apollinarii were among some Christians who remained, for which Bishop Theodotus excommunicated them. According to the Suda, Epiphanius taught rhetoric at Petra and Athens, where he succeeded Julian. Eunapius says that he only taught students from the east. He was at the height of his fame when Libanius arrived in Athens in 336. Although Libanius intended to study under him, some pupils of Diophantus the Arab forced him to join their master instead.. The Epiphanius of Libanius' correspondence is not the same person, see . Eunapius describes Epiphanius as skilled in the analysis of questions but week in discourse. Vindonius Anatolius considered him pedantically precise. His name appears paired with that of Genethlius of Petra in Zosimus' scholia on Demosthenes. Zosimus calls him \\"the theorist\\" and seems to have learned of Genethlius through his writings. There is also an allusion to Epiphanius in Menander's scholia on Demosthenes. He seems to have specialised in issue-theory (the framing of questions) and some fragments on this topic may be from his otherwise lost work On the Similarity and Difference of the Issues. Epiphanius did not live to old age. He and his wife, who was renowned for her beauty, both died childless from blood poisoning. This happened many years before Eunapius arrived in Athens in 362. The Suda lists the works of Epiphanius as: *On the Similarity and Difference of the Issues *Progymnasmata *Declamations *Demarchs *Polemarchikos *epideictic speeches *miscellaneous theoretical investigations NoteBibliography   * Category:4th-century Arabs Category:4th-century Romans Category:Roman-era students in Athens Category:Ancient Greek rhetoricians Category:Ancient Greek educators Category:Roman-era Sophists Category:Arabs in the Roman Empire Category:Byzantine-era pagans ","title":"Epiphanius of Petra"},{"id":"64103714","text":"Lower Turners Marsh is a rural locality in the local government areas of Launceston and George Town in the Launceston and North-east regions of Tasmania.

Sindh College Karachi. He also served as the first president of Sindh Historical Society.  Biography  Hotchand Gurbakhshani was born in a well educated Hindu Amil family of Hyderabad, Sindh, British India (Now Pakistan) on 8 March 1884. His father Deewan Molchand was employee of Revenue Department. His grandfather Deewan Nainsukhdas was a landlord. After attending Primary School, he was admitted in the Nevelrai Hiranand Academy of Hyderabad from where he passed matriculation examination in 1899. Then he went to Karachi and received Bachelor of Arts degree from D.J. Sindh College. It was one of the best colleges of Sindh at that time. He received Master of Arts degree in English and Persian from Wilson College Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1907. He was one of the best students of this college and based on merit he was offered position of Assistant Professor in the same college. He worked on this position only for a few months and then returned to Sindh and joined his alma mater D.J. Sindh College Karachi as a Professor of Persian. In 1928, he went to UK and received PhD degree from University of London. The title of his PhD thesis was Mysticism in the Early 19th Century Poetry of England. He spent rest of his life in D.J. College and served as Dean Faculty of Arts, Vice Principal and then Principal of this college. On 14 November 1921, on the request of Bombay University, he presented a scholarly report on Sindhi Literature to the University. Based on this report, the Bambay University decided to include Sindhi in college curriculum. Thus he laid the foundation for recognition of Sindhi language and literature in India. Dr Gurbakhshani was also founding President of Sindh Historical Society. The Journal of this society published valuable research articles on history of Sindh. This Society was founded for restructuring the history of Sindh. His father and grandfather were devotees of Shah Inayat Sufi, the great Sufi saint of Sindh, so he himself was attracted towards Sufism since childhood. He used to quote poetry of Moulana Rumi and Hazrat Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai in his lectures and speeches. He proved himself as a dedicated and best teacher. He produced many notable students including Dr Umar Bin Muhammad Daudpoto, Syed Miran Muhammad Shah and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ayub Khuhro.  Literary Contributions  The most significant scholarly contribution of Dr Gurbahshani was compilation of Shah Jo Risalo, the poetry collection of great Sufi poet Hazrat Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai. He planned to publish this Risalo in four volumes. However, only three volumes could be published. The fourth volume is missing. Some sources say that he gave his unpublished fourth volume to one his students for proofreading who misplaced/lost it and could not return it to the author. Other sources are of the opinion that the author could not publish it due to financial problems. The first volume published in 1923 contained five surs (melodies), 500 baits, 32 wais, along with the meaning and etymology of words and terms. He also explained various verses and discussed the background and the folktales used in the surs. This volume included the Introduction called Muqadema consisting of the Shah's biography, his personality and religion. This introduction was later slightly revised and published as separate booklet Muqdama-i-Lateefi, in 1936, was translated into English by Dr Habibullah Siddiqui and published by the Institute of Sindhology in 2009. The second volume was published in 1924 which contained six surs (938 baits, 78 wais). The third volume published in 1931 contained 601 baits and 32 wais.

Zheleva was the wife of Zhelyu Zhelev, the first non-Communist President of Bulgaria following the fall of communism in 1989. She remains the second longest serving first lady in Bulgaria's history. Biography Maria Zheleva was born on April 3, 1942, in Grozden, Burgas Province, Bulgaria. She met her husband, Zhelyu Zhelev, in the Sofia University library, where both were students. The couple married in 1961 and had two daughters, Yordanka (1963‚Äì1993) and Stanka (born 1966). In 1965, Zhelyu Zhelev was fired from his job and expelled from the Bulgarian Communist Party. As a result, the family moved to Maria Zheleva's home village of Grozden. Zhelyu Zhelev wrote his most famous book, \\"The Fascism\\" (–§–∞—à–∏–∑–º—ä—Ç), while living in Grozden. Maria Zheleva was partly responsible for the eventual publication of her husband's book. Zhelev had offered the manuscript of \\"Fascisim\\" to several publishing houses, but had been rejected each time. However, In 1978, Maria Zheleva had a chance encounter with Professor Ivan Slavov at a tram stop near Sofia University. Slavov had heard about Zhelev's writings and offered to eventually publish the book through the library and his Komsomol publishing company. Zheleva was skeptical of Slavov's interest, but still provided him with a manuscript and placed him in touch with her husband. Zhelev and Slavov later met, which led to eventual publication of \\"The Fascism\\" in 1982. The book was quickly banned by Bulgaria's communist government. Zheleva was a historian by profession. She spent much of her career as a film editor, film director, and screenwriter for Time (–í—Ä–µ–º–µ), a Bulgarian film studio in Boyana specializing in documentaries and science films. Maria Zheleva continued to work as a filmmaker across Bulgaria while simultaneously serving as First Lady inn the 1990s. In March 1995, First Lady Zheleva and a group of monks were caught making plum brandy by tax collectors while making a film at the Troyan Monastery. The tax collectors had paid a surprise, unannounced inspection of the monastery while Zheleva was filming the documentary on the monk's famous brandy and plum tree groves. The tax authorities were initially going to fine the monks for brewing unauthorized liquor, but Zheleva intervened and produced official documents which explained that the brandy-making was authorized due to the film. Maria Zheleva was initially reluctant to assume the role of first lady and president's wife once Zhelev became president in 1990. Zheleva confessed that she lost sleep, as well as 15 kilograms, from worrying about her husband and their family. However, she ultimately assumed the role through the transition to democracy, while continuing to pursue her own career in film. In a January 1992 interview, she stated that \\"I have no ambitions to be his advisor. Thank God, one less advisor to the president! When I talk to him, –Ü want him to hear me, not [just] listen to me.\\" She described herself as a supporter of the president, but also his biggest critic, and noted that her husband became more organized after becoming president. Though Zheleva avoided many of the ubiquitous cocktail parties and disliked being called \\"first lady,\\" she appeared at the major events and meetings with world leaders required by the roles of president and first lady. Maria Zheleva died from respiratory and heart failure in the intensive care unit of a Sofia hospital on December 8, 2013, at the age of 71. Zheleva had suffered from lung disease for much of her life. She was buried in her home village of Grozden on December 10, 2013. Her husband, former President Zhelyu Zhelev, died in 2015.

However, changes in the new constitution passed in the controversial constitutional referendum earlier in the year included resetting the presidential terms allowing incumbent president Alpha Cond√© to run for a third term.

In the 1970s, Latino immigrants started selling cultural goods and affordable services at swap meets in Southern California and some swap meets started resembling the tianguis, open-air markets, of Mexico. At the same time, drive- in movie theaters were becoming less popular, and their owners eagerly rented them out during the day to outdoor swap meets, which proliferated. Then, mostly Korean immigrants used their connections in the growing import/export trade with Asia to set up their own swap meet stalls and stock them with new, cheap goods from Asia instead of secondhand goods. In the 1980s and 1990s as properties South Los Angeles and parts of Central L.A. became abandoned and thus, cheap, Korean immigrants bought them and turned them into indoor swap meets.Frank Shyong, \\"Column: As an uncertain future looms, Los Angeles‚Äô swap meet vendors live in the moment\\", Los Angeles Times, July 20, 2020 Connection with gangsta rap A former Sears store in Compton turned into the Compton Fashion Fair indoor swap meet.

The tournament was produced and scripted by Mexican professional wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG), and took place over several weeks from Arena Naucalpan located in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, Mexico. This was the seventeenth time IWRG has held their annual IWRG Rey del Ring tournament, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing restrictions imposed by the Mexican government was not a 30-man elimination match like other years, but instead, a 30-man single-elimination tournament, filmed in the empty Arena Naucalpan for broadcast. Shun Skywalker, the winner of the 2020 Rey del Ring faced the reigning IWRG Rey del Ring Championship holder, Demonio Infernal, a week after the tournament finals in the final stage of the tournament. ProductionBackground= The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their annual Rey del Ring (\\"King of the Ring\\") event in 2002, creating an annual event around the eponymous Rey del Ring match, a 30-man elimination match similar in concept to the WWE's Royal Rumble match although in IWRG pinfalls and submission could also lead to elimination unlike the Royal Rumble. From 2002 until the 2011 event the \\"prize\\" for winning the match itself was simply the prestige of outlasting 29 other competitors, but at the 2011 Rey del Ring IWRG introduced the IWR Rey del Ring Championship complete with a belt to symbolize the championship that would be awarded to the winner each year. At that point in time the Rey del Ring title became a championship that could be defended and lost or won in matches in between the annual tournaments. For the tournament the champion would vacate the Rey del Ring Championship prior to the actual Rey del Ring match itself. All Rey del Ring shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general are held in Arena Naucalpan, owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2020 Rey del Ring will be the 18th over all Rey del Ring tournament held by IWRG. =Storylines= The event featured four professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. IWRG promoted the show without announcing a single participant ahead of time. Demonio Infernal won the 2019 Rey del Ring tournament and championship on May 19. His first title defense took place on June 19, at the Metaleon benefit show where he defeated Aram√≠s. Next up Demonio Infernal defeated Fresero Jr. on two occasions, followed by another successful defense on January 19, 2020 where he defeated Fuerza Guerrera Next Generation. The most recent championship defense took place on February 8 during an \\"Invasion Americana\\" show on the independent circuit. Demonio Infernal and Aaron Sykes wrestled to a draw, which meant that Demonio Infernal retained the championship. MasLuchas revealed that the 2020 Rey del Ring tournament would have a different format in 2020. Normally the Rey del Ring tournament includes up to 30 wrestlers in the ring. Due to various social distancing measurements imposed by the Mexican government due to COVID-19, IWRG decided to instead use a single-elimination tournament, with only two wrestlers and a referee in the ring at a time. They also announced that the shows would be without fans in attendance, but instead taped for television. The tournament starts with two blocks of 15 wrestlers until only one remains. For the third show, the two block winners face off, followed by the winner wrestling Demonio Infernal for the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship in the fourth week of the tournament.

History Millview may have been settled as early as 1783. Millview's history has been closely tied to that of the lumber industry, and the community was once home to as many as six different lumber mills and had a population of 3,000 residents. One of the first recorded sawmills was built in 1868 and could produce up to 35,000 feet of lumber per day. Some of the sawmills that operated in Millview included the Wright Mill, Robinson Mill, Seminole Mill, McLane Mill, New Mill and the Perdido Bay Lumber Company Mill. The Southern States Lumber Company purchased much of the land in Millview after the Civil War and donated land for a church and school. The Pensacola and Perdido Railroad was a 9-mile railroad that began hauling lumber from Millview to Pensacola Bay in 1874. In 1893, Henry McLaughlin extended the Pensacola, Alabama, and Tennessee Railroad from Millview to Muscogee.

The Candy bar protest, also known as the 5 cent chocolate war, the 5 cent war and the chocolate candy bar strike, was a short- lived 1947 protest by Canadian children over the increase in price of chocolate bars from five to eight cents.Equivalent in 2020 terms of an increase from CAD$0.61 to CAD$0.98. Source A typical hourly adult wage was about one dollar.Source The strike began in Ladysmith, British Columbia, and spread across the country to include protests in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, Toronto and the Maritimes. The strike ended when the Toronto Evening Telegram published an editorial suggesting that one of the organizations allied with the children, the National Federation of Labour Youth, was backed by communists. TimelineOrigins= On April 25, 1947, Canadian manufacturers of chocolate bars raised their prices from five cents per bar to 8 cents, citing increasing production costs. In particular, manufacturers cited problems with the cocoa bean supply and the elimination of wartime government subsidies as the reason for the price increase. The strike began on the same day in Ladysmith, British Columbia, at the Wigwam Cafe, a confectionery store and luncheonette. Shocked by the 60% price increase of the Wigwam's chocolate bars, of which there had been no advance notice, children organized a protest in front of the store, calling for a boycott of the bars, and adopting the slogan Don't be a sucker. They staged their initial protest using a slogan-covered 1923 black McLaughlin Buick, which was followed by 40 protesting children. As they marched, the children sang: > We want a 5 cent chocolate bar > 8 cents is going too darn far > We want a 5 cent chocolate bar > Oh, we want a 5 cent bar. They protested for three noon-hours in a row, and were reported by the local newspaper, the Ladsysmith Chronicle. Carrying homemade signs, some of which read DONT BUY 8¬¢ BARS. LOWER PRICES TO 5¬¢. WE ARE SMART and LET THE SUCKER PAY 8¬¢ WE WON'T, the children also posed for a Vancouver Sun newspaper photographer. The Sun ran the story and photograph on April 26. =Spread of protests= The candy bar protest in Edmonton, Alberta. By April 29, the strike had spread to nearby Victoria, British Columbia, the provincial capital, where an estimated 200 children stormed the city's legislature building. The city's Times Colonist newspaper of April 30 carried the story with the headline \\"Children Invade Legislature building\\", along with a photograph of placard-carrying children on the legislature's steps. As news coverage of the strike increased, the strike spread east. In Burnaby, British Columbia, a bicycle parade of protesting children is reported to have blocked Kingsway, a main thoroughfare. Sales of chocolate bars fell by a reported 80%, with Winnipeg merchants reporting a day where they failed to sell any bars. In Edmonton, Alberta, 300 children, accompanied by a police escort, marched down the city's Jasper Avenue to protest the increase on April 29. A few days later on May 2, 500 Toronto schoolchildren marched along Bloor Street to protest against the price hike. On May 3, in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, 60 students marched on Parliament Hill. Led by ten buglers, one carried a sign saying \\"We'll eat worms before we eat eight-cent chocolate bars\\". =Communist claims= Around the same time as the Toronto march, an anonymous tipster told the Toronto Evening Telegram that the National Federation of Labour Youth, which had supported the Toronto protest, had communist backing. The Telegram May 3 cover carried a story with the headline Reds Seen Duping Youth in 8-cent Bar Campaign. In the article, the paper wrote that > Chocolate bars and a world revolution may seem poles apart, but to the > devious, Communist mind, there is a close relationship. They don‚Äôt realize > it, but the indignant students parading with their placards demanding a 5 > cent candy bar have become another instrument in the Communist grand > strategy of the creation of chaos. The Financial Post newspaper followed up with an article headlined Communists run candy bar strike, recruit young children for parade. Fearing being associated with the supposed backers, the strike's organizational supporters and the parents of the child strikers began to withdraw. The Youth Action Committee of Victoria BC, which had supported the strike, withdrew their support on May 5. Vancouver's Sat-Teen Club, whose 2500 members had supported the strike, withdrew and stated that \\"mob demonstrations and strikes are not consistent with the ideals of the club\\". Ultimately, the strike fizzled out and the price of chocolate bars was maintained at eight cents. =Reactions and legacy= In response to the strike, on May 2 the candy manufacturer Rowntree's published an open letter in Canadian newspapers titled Why You Pay 8¬¢ for a Rowntree Chocolate Bar. A representative of the Moirs chocolate company spoke on CBC radio to defend the price increase. On May 7, 1947, the Toronto company Willards' Chocolates published an open letter in the Toronto Star with the headline \\"5¬¢ Chocolate Bars just aren't possible NOW\\". The strike was the subject of the 2000 documentary film The Five Cent War. The 2007 novel Maggie and the Chocolate War by Canadian author Michelle Mulder was based on the protest. The strike was memorialized in 2017 with a public mural in Chemainus, British Columbia. The mural, based on the original Vancouver Sun photograph, depicts the original Ladysmith protesters eating ice cream rather than chocolate bars, as ice cream was still priced at five cents.

Personal Life  Donisthorpe was born as Gladys Millie Leon in London in 1898. In 1916, Donisthorpe married British inventor and tennis player Frank Wordsworth Donisthorpe, son of Wordsworth Donisthorpe. Donisthorpe was eighteen years old, and the two married in Southwark, England.\\"Gladys Leon\\" in the England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005 (General Register Office; United Kingdom; Volume: 1d; Page: 238) Her name thus changed to Gladys Sheila Donisthorpe.  Career  Donisthorpe composed advertising copy for Selfridges department stores. Donisthorpe's first novel, You (1928), was called \\"a childishly immature, pretentious, and trivial book, with no artistic excuse for its existence\\" in an American newspaper. Her next novel was the pulpy Loveliest of Friends! (1931), a cautionary story about married women seduced into lesbian relationships. \\"If the book is a trifle wordy, the words are all of a dark, poisonous, decadent beauty, a lush pornography, like the tale,\\" commented a North Carolina reviewer. A Boston reviewer considered it \\"an unhappy and revolting novel.\\" The novel was popular in the United States and Great Britain, going through several editions. Of Loveliest of Friends! and its lesbian themes, Neil Pearson wrote: \\"since everything else Donisthorpe wrote seems to have been drawn from life it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that Loveliest of Friends describes a phase in her personal development‚Äù, but that with the content of the book in mind and how anti-lesbian it was, ‚Äú[Donisthorpe] wasn‚Äôt gay, and it shows.‚ÄùPearson, Neil. ‚ÄúAuthor Biographies.‚Äù Obelisk: A History of Jack Kahane and the Obelisk Press, Liverpool University Press, 2007, pg. 352.

Pacing is commonly used to help manage conditions that cause chronic pain or chronic fatigue.  Aims  Pacing aims to manage symptoms by avoiding the \\"boom and bust\\" cycle that is common among people exceeding their current, limited capacities. This often leads to being forced to stop their activities as a result of pain, fatigue or other symptoms, and then requiring a large amount of rest before being able to resume their activity. The cycle then repeats.  Elements of pacing  There is no consensus regarding what elements are part of pacing. Pacing typically involves: * planning activities in advance * taking regular rest breaks * choosing activities based on available energy * prioritizing activities Uses Pacing has been used to help manage a wide variety of different illnesses and disabilities, including neuromuscular diseases like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), rheumatoid or immune-mediated diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis and fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndromes (EDS). = Outcomes = In many health conditions, there are no clinical trials to establish the effectiveness of pacing.

Biography Atherton was a successful artist; a painter, magazine illustrator, writer and designer. His works are within numerous collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Early Years He was the son of James Chester Atherton (1868-1928) and Carrie B. Martin (1871-1909). His father was Canadian born. His parents relocated from Minnesota to Washington State, with his maternal grandparents whilst he was still an infant. He attended high school in Spokane, Washington. Atherton didn't display an early aptitude for art; rather, his first love was nature and the activities he relished there, mainly fishing and hunting. He enlisted in 1917, serving briefly in the U.S. Navy for a year during World War I. At the end of the war, determined to get an education he worked various part-time jobs, as a sign painter and playing a banjo in a dance band to pay his enrolment fee at the College of the Pacific and The California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). Once there, he also worked in the surrounding studios developing his oil painting techniques. Career A first prize award of $500 at the annual exhibition of the Bohemian Club in 1929, financed his one way trip to New York, which helped to launch his career as an artist. Atherton had aspired to be a fine artist, however his first paid jobs were for commercial art firms designing advertisements for corporations such as General Motors, Shell Oil, Container Corporation of America, and Dole. However, by 1936, encouraged primarily by friends, such as Alexander Brook, an acclaimed New York realist painter, he returned to the fine arts. Atherton continued to accept numerous commissions for magazine illustrations; such as Fortune magazine, and over the years he would paint more than forty covers for The Saturday Evening Post starting with his December 1942 design, ‚ÄúPatient Dog.‚Äù This picture is reminiscent of his friend Norman Rockwell ‚ÄòAmericana style‚Äô and captures a poignant moment of nostalgia, where a loyal dog looks toward a wall of hunting equipment and a framed picture of his owner in military uniform. =Selected One person Exhibitions= Atherton accomplished his first one-man show in Manhattan in 1936. His Painting, ‚ÄúThe Black Horse‚Äù won the $3000 fourth prize from among a pool of 14,000 entries. This painting forms part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art collection in New York. Atherton achieved recognition in New York City and elsewhere during the 1930s. Having exhibited at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York, his paintings began to be collected by museums; including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His reputation increased with his art deco stone lithograph poster for the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1941, his design won first place in the Museum of Modern Arts ‚ÄúNational Defense Poster Competition‚Äù. =Selected Public Collections= *Fleming Museum of Art, Burlington, Vermont *Albright-Knox Art Gallery,Buffalo, NY *Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago *Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, CT *Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York *Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York *The Museum of Modern Art, New York *Whitney Museum of American Art, New York *Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia *De Young Museum, San Francisco *Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington DC *Butler Institute of American Art Youngstown, OH =The Famous Artists School= Founded in 1948 in Westport, Connecticut, U.S.A. The idea was conceived by members of the New York Society of Illustrators (SOI), but due to the Society's legal status, could not be operated by it. SOI member Albert Dorne led the initiative to set up a separate entity, and recruited the support of Norman Rockwell, who was also an SOI member. For the founding faculty, Dorne recruited Atherton, as well as accomplished artists such as Austin Briggs, Stevan Dohanos, Robert Fawcett, Peter Helck, Fred Ludekens, Al Parker, Norman Rockwell, Ben Stahl, Harold von Schmidt and Jon Whitcomb. =Society of Illustrators= Atherton as an active member from his arrival in New York. The society have owned many of his works.

They had one daughter, Mary Atherton, born in 1932. Atherton's often chose industrial landscapes, however found himself spending considerable time in Westport, Connecticut, with an active artistic community, and it became home for him, and his family. He then moved to Arlington, Vermont. Norman Rockwell enlisted Atherton in what was to be the only collaborative painting in his career He was part of a group of artists including a Norman Rockwell, Mead Schaeffer and George Hughes who established residences in Arlington. Atherton and Mead Schaeffer were avid fly fishermen and they carefully chose the location for the group, conveniently located near the legendary Battenkill River. In his free time, Atherton continued to enjoy fly-fishing. He brought his artistic talent into the field of fishing, when he wrote and illustrated the fishing classic, ‚ÄúThe Fly and The Fish‚Äù. Death He died in New Brunswick, Canada in 1952, at the age of 52 in a drowning accident while fly-fishing.

Although the house is most well-known now for its association with the William Temple community, it was originally commissioned in 1891 by Kenneth A. J. Mackenzie, a medical professional in Oregon, and his wife, Cora Mackenzie, as their private residence. The Portland architecture firm of McCaw, Martin, and White was selected by the MacKenzies to design the house. The Mackenzies owned the house and resided in it until Kenneth A. J. Mackenzie‚Äôs death in 1920, when it was sold. The house has had several owners since then, eventually being placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The house has three stories and is roughly 7,100 square feet. The Mackenzie house is a prominent example of the influence of the Richardsonian Romanesque Revival architectural style on the west coast. Style Originating in Europe during the Early or High Middle Ages, Romanesque architecture was popular in medieval Europe until the development of the Gothic architectural style.‚ÄúRomanesque Architecture,‚Äù Encyclopedia Britannica, 9 April 2020. The original Romanesque style incorporated aspects of ancient Roman and Byzantine architecture as well as local traditions and rounded arches were characteristic of the style. In medieval Europe, Romanesque style was largely used in the building of churches which came with the growth of monasticism. Richardsonian Romanesque Revival was introduced by architect Henry Hobson Richardson and is said to be a distinctly American version of the Romanesque Revival architectural style.Susan Vogel, ‚ÄúHartwell and Richardson: An Introduction to Their Work,‚Äù Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, May 1973. McCaw, Martin, and White Architects designed many of the Romanesque-style buildings in Oregon, the Mackenzie House being a prime example. The Mackenzie House is a three story, roughly 7,100 square foot house constructed of stone, from its heavy masonry facades to its slate roof. Many characteristics of the Richardsonian Romanesque style are found in the design of the house, including the three story tower on the east side and an array of porches, terraces, and bay and oriel windows. The exterior stonework of the Mackenzie House is done in sandstone, quarried at the Tenino Quarry near Olympia, Washington. Tenino sandstone was also used in other iconic historic buildings around the Portland area, Pittock Mansion and Trinity Episcopal Church being primary examples.‚ÄúOregon SP Mackenzie, Dr. K.A.J. and Cora House,‚Äù (Public government document, United States Department of the Interior, Public Park Service, 2 May 1996), Section 7 Page 1. However, the Mackenzie House was the first residential building to be made entirely of stone.‚ÄúA Fine Residence‚Äù, in ‚ÄúPencil and Notebook.‚Äù Morning Oregonian, February 20, 1891, p. 5 The semi-circle arches around the porch and the rounded tops of many of the windows call back to the medieval Romanesque style while the shingle styled gable ties into the Richardsonian Romanesque Revival. In addition to the clear influence of Richardsonian Romanesque in the design of the house, there are also small exterior details that give a nod to Kenneth Mackenzie‚Äôs Scottish heritage such as the life-size stage head on the south facade and the images of Scottish thistle carved into the front door.‚ÄúOregon SP Mackenzie, Dr. K.A.J. and Cora House,‚Äù (Public government document, United States Department of the Interior, Public Park Service, 2 May 1996), Section 7 Page 5. The interior of the Mackenzie house aligns with the style and level of detail of the exterior of the structure. The floor of the entryway contains a tile mosaic while the main rooms contain hardwood floors and hand-carved wood detailing on the walls and ceilings. Characteristic of the designs of Henry Hobson Richardson, the Mackenzie house contains several inglenooks with arched entryways and fireplaces surrounded by hand-painted mosaic and carved wood. In several locations inside the house, carvings and stain-glass-windows continue the Scottish thistle motif first seen from the exterior. History Kenneth A. J. Mackenzie was a physician who gained his medical education from McGill University and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, finally settling down in Portland, Oregon in 1883.‚ÄúA House of Stone for Dr. Mackenzie: Rebuilding Portland‚Äôs Architectural History,‚Äù A Lecture Presented by Edward H. Teague at the Architectural Heritage Center, Portland, Oregon, January 28, 2012. He was a prominent figure in Oregon, known for his achievements during his medical career such as being president of the Oregon State Medical Society and dean of the University of Oregon Medical School. The Mackenzie house is not only a product of Richardsonian Romanesque design, but of the region's craftsmanship. The house was designed by McCaw, Martin, and White Architects, a notable firm in Portland during the end of the 19th-century, and constructed in 1892. McCaw, Martin, and White designed many of the Richardsonian Romanesque structures in Portland, such as the Portland Armory Annex and the West Hall of University of Portland, and incorporated local materials and talent. The Mackenzie house was registered in the National Register of Historical Places on May 31, 1996.

He later completed a cabinet making apprenticeship, and then in 1854 emigrated to Melbourne. After failing to make his fortune on the Victorian goldfields, he crossed to Otago, where he did well on the Central Otago diggings.

The protests began as part of the responses to the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who was killed during an arrest after Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis Police Department officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as three other officers looked on. Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the arrest which led to Floyd's death were later arrested. Local protests began in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota before quickly spreading nationwide and in over 2,000 cities and towns in over 60 countries in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Polls in summer 2020 estimated that between 15 million and 26 million people had participated at some point in the demonstrations in the United States, making the protests the largest in U.S. history. Protests have continued as of October 2020. While the majority of protests have been peaceful, demonstrations in some cities escalated into riots, looting, and street skirmishes with police. Some police responded to protests with instances of police brutality, including against reporters. At least 200 cities in the U.S. had imposed curfews by early June, while more than 30 states and Washington, D.C. activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel due to the mass unrest. By the end of June, at least 14,000 people had been arrested. It was estimated that between May 26 and August 22, 93% of individual protests were \\"peaceful and nondestructive\\". Another estimate was that 96.3% of the protests involved no injuries and no property damage. The protests precipitated a cultural reckoning on racial injustice in the United States and have led to numerous legislative proposals on federal, state and municipal levels intended to combat police misconduct, systemic racism, qualified immunity and police brutality in the United States, while the Trump administration has drawn widespread criticism for what critics called its hardline rhetoric and aggressive, militarized response.For criticism of the Trump administration's response, see:    * The protests led to a wave of monument removals and name changes throughout the world. The protests have been ongoing during the global COVID-19 pandemic. BackgroundPolice brutality in the United States= Frequent cases of police misconduct and fatal use of force by law enforcement officers in the U.S., particularly against African Americans, have long led the civil rights movement and other activists to protest against the lack of police accountability in incidents involving excessive force. Many protests during the civil rights movement were a response to police brutality, including the 1965 Watts riots which resulted in the deaths of 34 people, mostly African Americans. The largest post-civil rights movement protest in the 20th Century was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were in response to the acquittal of police officers responsible for excessive force against Rodney King, an African American man. In 2014, the shooting of Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri resulted in local protests and unrest while the death of Eric Garner in New York City resulted in numerous national protests. After Eric Garner and George Floyd repeatedly said \\"I can't breathe\\" during their arrests, the phrase became a protest slogan against police brutality. In 2015 the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore police custody resulted in riots in the city and nationwide protests as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. Several nationally publicized incidents occurred in Minnesota, including the 2015 shooting of Jamar Clark in Minneapolis; the 2016 shooting of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights; and the 2017 shooting of Justine Damond. In 2016, Tony Timpa was killed by Dallas police officers in the same way as George Floyd. In March 2020, the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor by police executing a search warrant at her Kentucky apartment was also widely publicized. =COVID-19 pandemic= Measures taken against the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of non- essential businesses and implementation of stay-at-home orders, had significant economic and social impact on many Americans as millions had lost their jobs and were made more economically vulnerable. = Killing of George Floyd = alt=Tribute items left at site of death forming a makeshift memorial According to a police statement, on May 25, 2020, at 8:08p.m. CDT, Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officers responded to a 9-1-1 call regarding a \\"forgery in progress\\" on Chicago Avenue South in Powderhorn, Minneapolis. MPD Officers Thomas K. Lane and J. Alexander Kueng arrived with their body cameras turned on. A store employee told officers that the man was in a nearby car. Officers approached the car and ordered George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, who according to police \\"appeared to be under the influence\\", to exit the vehicle, at which point he \\"physically resisted\\". According to the MPD, officers \\"were able to get the suspect into handcuffs, and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance.\\" Once Floyd was handcuffed, he and Officer Lane walked to the sidewalk. Floyd sat on the ground at Officer Lane's direction. In a short conversation, the officer asked Floyd for his name and identification, explaining that he was being arrested for passing counterfeit currency, and asked if he was \\"on anything\\". According to the report officers Kueng and Lane attempted to help Floyd to their squad car, but at 8:14 p.m., Floyd stiffened up and fell to the ground. Soon, MPD Officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao arrived in a separate squad car. The officers made several more failed attempts to get Floyd into the squad car. Floyd, who was still handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer Kueng held Floyd's back and Lane held his legs. Chauvin placed his left knee in the area of Floyd's head and neck. A Facebook Live livestream recorded by a bystander showed Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. Floyd repeatedly tells Chauvin \\"Please\\" and \\"I can't breathe\\", while a bystander is heard telling the police officer, \\"You got him down. Let him breathe.\\" After some time, a bystander points out that Floyd was bleeding from his nose while another bystander tells the police that Floyd is \\"not even resisting arrest right now\\", to which the police tell the bystanders that Floyd was \\"talking, he's fine\\". A bystander replies saying Floyd \\"ain't fine\\". A bystander then protests that the police were preventing Floyd from breathing, urging them to \\"get him off the ground ... You could have put him in the car by now. He's not resisting arrest or nothing.\\" Floyd then goes silent and motionless. Chauvin does not remove his knee until an ambulance arrives. Emergency medical services put Floyd on a stretcher. Not only had Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for about seven minutes (including four minutes after Floyd stopped moving) but another video showed an additional two officers had also knelt on Floyd while another officer watched. A George Floyd mural created by protesters in Portland, Oregon Although the police report stated that medical services were requested prior to the time Floyd was placed in handcuffs, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Emergency Medical Services arrived at the scene six minutes after getting the call. Medics were unable to detect a pulse, and Floyd was pronounced dead at the hospital. An autopsy of Floyd was conducted on May 26, and the next day, the preliminary report by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office was published, which found \\"no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\\". Floyd's underlying health conditions included coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The initial report said that \\"the combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\\" The medical examiner further said Floyd was \\"high on fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamine at the time of his death\\". On June 1, a private autopsy commissioned by the family of Floyd ruled the death a homicide and found that Floyd had died due to asphyxiation from sustained pressure, which conflicted with the original autopsy report done earlier that week. Shortly after, the official post-mortem declared Floyd's death a homicide. Video footage of Officer Derek Chauvin applying 8 minutes 15 seconds of sustained pressure to Floyd's neck generated global attention and raised questions about the use of force by law enforcement. On May 26, Chauvin and the other three officers were fired. He was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter; the former charge was later changed to second-degree murder.

By midday, people had gathered by the thousands at the location of Floyd's death and set up a makeshift memorial. Organizers of the rally emphasized keeping the protest peaceful. Protesters and Floyd's family demanded that all four officers at the scene of his arrest and death be charged with murder and that judicial consequences were swift. That evening, the protest rally turned into a march to the Minneapolis Police Department's third precinct station where the officers were believed to work. After the main protest group disbanded, a small skirmish the night of May 26 resulted in minor property damage at the station and the police firing tear gas at demonstrators.Caputo, Angela, Craft, Will and Gilbert, Curtis (June 30, 30). \\"‚ÄòThe precinct is on fire‚Äô: What happened at Minneapolis‚Äô 3rd Precinct ‚Äî and what it means\\".

Some initial acts of property destruction on May 27 by a 32-year-old man with ties to white supremacist organizations, who local police investigators said was deliberately inciting racial tension, led to a chain reaction of fires and looting.Jany, Libor (July 28, 2020). \\"Police: 'Umbrella Man' was a white supremacist trying to incite George Floyd rioting\\".

It is unclear if demonstrators were reacting to the graphic video of Floyd's death or the culmination of a string of black American deaths, preceded by Ahmaud Arbery in Atlanta on February 23 and Breonna Taylor in Louisville on March 13. By May 28, protests had sprung up in several major U.S. cities with demonstrations increasing each day. By June, protests had been held in all U.S. states. At least 200 cities had imposed curfews, and at least 27 states and Washington, D.C. activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel in response to the unrest. In Seattle, starting in early June, protesters occupied an area of several city blocks after the police vacated it, declaring it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, where according to protesters \\"the police are forbidden, food is free and documentaries are screened at night\\". On June 10, President Trump challenged mayor Jenny Durkan and governor Jay Inslee to \\"take back your city\\", and implying, according to Durkan, the possibility of a military response. On June 6, an estimated half a million people joined protests in 550 places in the United States. On June 8, 2020, the police-free Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone was established in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. On June 14, an estimated 15,000 people gathered outside the Brooklyn Museum at Grand Army Plaza for the Liberation March, a silent protest in response to police brutality and violence against black transgender women. Frustrated by the lack of media coverage over the deaths of Nina Pop, who was stabbed in Sikeston, Missouri on May 3 and Tony McDade, who was shot by police in Tallahassee, Florida on May 27, artist and drag performer West Dakota and her mentor, drag queen Merrie Cherry, decided to organize a silent rally inspired by the 1917 NAACP Silent Parade. The march generated widespread media attention as one of the largest peaceful protests in modern New York City history. On June 19, Juneteenth, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) shut down ports on the West Coast in solidarity with protesters. An educator from the University of Washington said that the union has a history of protest and leftist politics since its founding: \\"[The ILWU] understood that division along the lines of race only benefited employers, because it weakened the efforts of workers to act together and to organize together. The UAW also asked members to join the protests by standing down for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time Chauvin was initially reported to have held his knee to Floyd's neck. On June 17, in response to the protests, three different police reform plans, plans from the Republicans, the Democrats, and the White House, were unveiled aiming to curb police brutality and the use of violence by law enforcement. On June 25, NPR reported that the hopes for passage were doubtful because they were \\"short-circuited by a lack of bipartisan consensus on an ultimate plan [and] the issue is likely stalled, potentially until after the fall election\\". Protests continued over the weekend of June 19 in many cities, and observations of Juneteenth gained a new awareness. Jon Batiste, bandleader for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, took part in a Juneteenth day of protests, marches, rallies and vigils to \\"celebrate, show solidarity, and fight for equal rights and treatment of Black people\\" in Brooklyn. Batiste also appeared in concert with Matt Whitaker in a performance presented in partnership with Sing For Hope, performed on the steps of the Brooklyn Public Library. As of July 3, protests were ongoing. Over the course of the demonstrations, protests have occurred in over 40% of the counties in the United States. Polls suggesting between 15 million and 26 million people participated, which would make these demonstrations the largest in United States history. On July 20, the Strike for Black Lives, a mass walkout intended to raise awareness of systemic racism, featured thousands of workers across the United States walking off their jobs for approximately 8 minutes, in honor of Floyd. To mark what would have been Floyd's 47th birthday, groups across the US staged eventshttps://katu.com/news/local/protesters-stage-sit- in-at-portlands-revolution-hall-to-mark-george-floyds-47th-birthday and celebrities paid tribute to him.https://people.com/crime/beyonce-kerry- washington-and-more-remember-george-floyd-on-what-wouldve-been-his-47th- birthday/ =Elsewhere in the world= Protest at Alexanderplatz in Berlin on June 6 Protests over Floyd's death quickly spread worldwide. Protests in Canada, Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa have rallied against what they perceived as racial discrimination and police brutality, with some protests aimed at United States embassies. Over the weekend of June 7 and 8, surfers around the world held a \\"Paddle Out\\", a Hawaiian mourning tradition, for George Floyd and all the lives lost to police violence. Thousands observed the tradition in Honolulu, Hawaii, La Jolla, Hermosa Beach and Santa Monica, California, Galveston, Hackensack, New Jersey, Rockaway Beach, New York, Biarritz, France, Senegal and Australia. Activation of non-local forces alt=Map of US showing National Guard deployments at of June 16 =State= By June 9, governors in more than 30 states and Washington, D.C. had deployed about 32,000 National Guard members. =Federal= United States President Donald Trump controversially threatened to deploy the U.S. military in response to the unrest. On June 3 he said \\"If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem.\\" This would require invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, last used to quell the 1992 Los Angeles riots on May 1, 1992 by Executive Order 12804. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton also pushed for the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division to be deployed to quell the unrest, calling protesters \\"Antifa terrorists\\". Cotton tweeted \\"No quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.\\" However, many legal experts said this would violate the Department of Defense Law of War Manual, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions. Cotton later said he was using \\"no quarter\\" in a colloquial sense, but Mark Zaid and Tom Nichols responded that the legal definition of the term is a war crime. Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton said federal troops should \\"lay down [their] arms\\" if deployed in the United States. On June 4, federal agencies added about of fencing around the White House, Lafayette Square, and The Ellipse. Protesters used the fencing to post signs and artwork expressing their views. On June 11, the fencing was taken down, and some signs were collected by Smithsonian Museum curators from the National Museum of African American History and Culture. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, authorized to provide aerial surveillance \\"to assist law enforcement and humanitarian relief efforts\\" when requested, provided drone imagery during the protests. Federal policing of protests As of June 5, 2,950 federal law enforcement personnel from a dozen agencies, including the Secret Service, Capital Police, Park Police, Customs and Border Protection, FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, Bureau of Prisons' Special Operations Response Team, DEA's Special Response Team, ATF, and Marshals Service's Special Operations Group, have been dispatched to assist local authorities, with most of them being garrisoned in D.C. The DEA's legal authority was specifically expanded by the Department of Justice beyond usual limits to include surveillance of protesters and the ability to arrest for non-drug related offenses. In response, Representatives Jerry Nadler and Karen Bass of the House Judiciary Committee denounced the move and requested a formal briefing from DEA Acting Administrator Timothy Shea. On June 26, President Trump signed an executive order permitting federal agencies to provide personnel \\"to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property\\". Following the executive order, the Department of Homeland Security sent officers from Customs and Border Protection to Portland, Oregon, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. This was a departure from Homeland Security's normal role of protecting against threats from abroad. Critics accused federal authorities of overstepping their jurisdiction and using excessive force against protesters. Oregon governor Kate Brown called for federal agents to scale back their response and criticized Trump's actions: \\"President Trump deploying armed federal officers to Portland only serves to escalate tensions and, as we saw yesterday, will inevitably lead to unnecessary violence and confrontation.\\" Portland mayor Ted Wheeler demanded the agents be removed after citizens were detained far from the federal property agents were sent to protect. From at least July 14, unidentified federal officers wearing camouflage used unmarked vans to detain protesters in Portland, Oregon‚Äîsometimes without explaining the reason for their arrest. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called these actions unconstitutional kidnappings. In The Nation, Jeet Heer also called the actions unconstitutional and wrote that \\"The deployment of unidentified federal officers is particularly dangerous in... Portland and elsewhere in America, because it could easily lead to right-wing militias' impersonating legal authorities and kidnapping citizens.\\" On July 20, the Chicago Tribune reported that the Department of Homeland Security was preparing to send 150 federal agents to Chicago. Violence and controversies As of June 22, 2020, police have made 14,000 arrests in 49 cities since the protests began, with most arrests being locals charged with low-level offenses such as violating curfews or blocking roadways. As of June 8, 2020, at least 19 people have died during the protests. The Los Angeles Police Department announced that \\"homicides went up 250% and victims shot went up 56%\\" from May 31 to June 6. Several protests over Floyd's death, including one in Chicago, turned into riots. On May 29, 2020, civil rights leader Andrew Young stated that riots, violence, and looting \\"hurt the cause instead of helping it\\". George Floyd's family has denounced the violent protests. A study conducted by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project found that about 93% of 7,750 protests from May 26 through August 22 remained peaceful and nondestructive. There have been numerous reports and videos of aggressive police actions using physical force including \\"batons, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters, bystanders and journalists, often without warning or seemingly unprovoked\\". These incidents have provoked \\"growing concern that aggressive law enforcement tactics intended to impose order were instead inflaming tensions\\". The police responded that such tactics are necessary to prevent vandalism and arson, and that police officers themselves have been assaulted with thrown rocks and water bottles. Amnesty International issued a press release calling for the police to end excessive militarized responses to the protests. At least 66 incidents of vehicles driving into crowds of protesters were recorded from May 27 to July 6, with at least four ruled accidental and seven involving police officers. Since 2015, such actions have been encouraged against Black Lives Matter protests by \\"Run Them Over\\" and \\"All Lives Splatter\\" memes online, as well as items posted on Fox News and on social media by police officers. There have been allegations of foreign influence stoking the unrest online, with the role of outside powers being additive rather than decisive as of May 31. Several analysts have said that there was a lack of evidence for foreign meddling ‚Äì whether to spread disinformation or sow divisiveness ‚Äì but suggest that the messaging and coverage from these countries has more to do with global politics. =Police attacks on journalists= According to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, at least 100 journalists have been arrested while covering the protests, while 114 have been physically attacked by police officers. Although some journalists have been attacked by protesters, over 80% of incidents involving violence against the news media were committed by law enforcement officers. The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused police officers of intentionally targeting news crews in an attempt to intimidate them from covering the protests. Some journalists covering the protests in Minneapolis had their tires slashed by Minnesota State Patrol troopers and Anoka County sheriff's deputies. =Injuries caused by police projectiles= During the week of May 30, 12 people, including protesters, journalists and bystanders, were partially blinded after being struck with police projectiles. By June 21, at least 20 people had suffered serious eye injuries. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has called on police departments to stop using rubber bullets for crowd control, writing in a statement that \\"Americans have the right to speak and congregate publicly and should be able to exercise that right without the fear of blindness.\\" =Extremist participation= There have been accusations of various extremist groups using the cover of the protests to foment general unrest in the United States. CNN initially reported on May 31 that \\"although interference in this way may be happening, federal and local officials have yet to provide evidence to the public.\\" A number of Trump administration officials and politicians such as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray have alleged that \\"anarchists\\" and \\"far-left extremist\\" groups, including \\"Antifa\\", were exploiting the situation or were responsible for violence. However, there is no evidence that antifa- aligned individuals played a role in instigating the protests or violence or that antifa played a significant role in the protests, and the Trump administration has provided no evidence for its claims. The vast majority of protests were peaceful; among the 14,000 arrests made, most were for minor offenses such as alleged curfew violations or blocking a roadway. Persons involved in visible crimes such as arson or property damage were not ideologically organized, although some were motivated by anger towards police. Episodes of looting were committed by \\"regular criminal groups\\" and street gangs and was motivated by personal gain rather than ideology. A large number of white nationalists did not appear in response to the protests, although \\"a handful of apparent lone actors\\" were arrested for attempting to harm protesters. However, there was a scattered number of armed paramilitary-style militia movement groups and there were \\"several cases where members of these groups discharged firearms, causing chaos or injuring protesters\\". According to the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights (IREHR), which mapped the appearance of various right-wing or far-right actors or extremist groups at rallies throughout the United States, there had been 136 confirmed cases of right-wing participation at the protests by June 19, with many more unconfirmed. Boogaloo, Three Percenters, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, neo- Confederates, white nationalists, and an assortment of militias and vigilante groups reportedly had a presence at some protests, mostly in small towns and rural areas. Boogaloo groups, who are generally pro-gun, anti-government, and far-right accelerationists, have reportedly been present at no less than 40 George Floyd protests, several reportedly linked with violence. Their continued presence online has caused Facebook and TikTok to take action against their violent and anti-government posts. Use of social media alt=Protesters wearing COVID masks marching down a Baltimore street on May 30 Many individuals and celebrities used social media to document the protests, spread information, promote donation sites, and post memorials to George Floyd. Following Floyd's death, a 15-year-old started a Change.org petition titled \\"Justice for George Floyd\\", demanding that all four police officers involved be charged. The petition was both the largest and fastest-growing in the site's history, reaching over 13 million signatures. During this time, multiple videos of the protests, looting, and riots were shared by journalists and protesters with many videos going viral. One such video was of a destroyed and smoky Minneapolis Target store that the poster claimed was damaged during the protests. Facebook's decision not to remove or label President Trump's tweet of \\"When the looting starts, the shooting starts\\" prompted complaints from Facebook employees that political figures were getting a special exemption from the site's content policies. Actions included internal petition, questioning the CEO at an employee town hall, some resignations, and an employee walkout. = Documentation = A remix of Childish Gambino's song \\"This is America\\" and Post Malone's \\"Congratulations\\" was used heavily by protesters sharing footage of protests and police action on TikTok. Others used personal Twitter pages to post video documentation of the protests to highlight police and protesters actions, as well as points of the protests they felt would not be reported. One example was a viral photo that appears to show white women protesters standing with their arms locked between Louisville Metro Police Officers and protesters, with the caption describing the image and \\"This is love. This is what you do with your privilege.\\" Viral images of officers \\"taking a knee\\" with protesters and engaging in joint displays against police brutality, highlighted by hashtags such as #WalkWithUs, have circulated widely on social media. These acts have been identified by some cultural critics as copaganda, or \\"feel-good images\\" to boost public relations. Official social media accounts of police departments boosted positive images of collaboration. In some cases, these displays of solidarity, such as police kneeling, have been recognized as occurring moments before police teargassed crowds or inflicted violence on them. An article in The Fader characterized these acts as public relations tactics which were being undermined by police violence, \\"It feels like we go past the point of no return several times each day.\\" = Activism = alt=Protesters in Miami on June 6 K-pop fan accounts hijacked right wing and pro-Trump hashtags on social media, flooding trending hashtags with images and videos of their favorite artists. Users attempting to look up the hashtags #WhiteLivesMatter, #WhiteoutWednesday and #BlueLivesMatter were met with messages and video clips of dancing idols. After the Dallas Police Department asked Twitter users to submit videos of protesters' illegal activity to its iWatch Dallas app, submissions of K-pop videos led to the temporary removal of the app due to \\"technical difficulties\\". On May 28, hacktivist group Anonymous released a video to Facebook and the Minneapolis Police Department entitled \\"Anonymous Message To The Minneapolis Police Department\\", in which they state that they are going to seek revenge on the Minneapolis Police Department, and \\"expose their crimes to the world\\". According to Bloomberg, the video was initially posted on an unconfirmed Anonymous Facebook page. MisinformationOfficial statements= Minnesota Governor Tim Walz speculated that there was \\"an organized attempt to destabilize civil society\\", initially stating that as many as 80% of the individuals had possibly come from outside the state, and the mayor of St. Paul, Melvin Carter, said everyone arrested in St. Paul on May 29 was from out of state. However, jail records showed that the majority of those arrested were in-state. At a press conference later the same day, Carter explained that he had \\"shared‚Ä¶ arrest data received in [his] morning police briefing which [he] later learned to be inaccurate\\". Numerous eyewitness accounts and news reporters indicated that tear gas was used to disperse protesters in Lafayette Square. Despite this evidence, U.S. Park Police officials said, \\"USPP officers and other assisting law enforcement partners did not use tear gas or OC Skat Shells to close the area at Lafayette Park\\", adding that they only used \\"pepper balls\\" and \\"smoke canisters\\". Donald Trump's presidential campaign demanded news outlets retract reports of \\"tear gas\\" use. President Trump called the reports \\"fake\\" and said \\"they didn't use tear gas.\\" =Press statements= Protesters in Eugene, Oregon on June 9 On June 6, the New York Post reported that a NYPD source said $2.4 million of Rolex watches had been looted during protests from a Soho Rolex store. However, the store in question was actually a Watches of Switzerland outlet that denied anything was stolen. Rolex confirmed that \\"no watches of any kind were stolen, as there weren't any on display in the store.\\" On the night of May 31, exterior lights on the north side of the White House went dark as usual at 11pm, while protesters were demonstrating outside. The Guardian mistakenly reported that \\"in normal times, they are only ever turned off when a president dies.\\" A 2015 stock photograph of the White House, edited to show the lights turned off, was shared tens of thousands of times online, including by Hillary Clinton. While the photograph did not depict the building at the time of the protests, Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that the lights \\"go out at about 11 p.m. almost every night\\". A June 12 article by The Seattle Times found that Fox News published a photograph of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone that had been digitally altered to include a man armed with an assault rifle. The Fox News website also used a photograph of a burning scene from the Minnesota protests to illustrate their articles on Seattle's protests. Fox removed the images and issued an apology, stating the digitally altered image was a collage that \\"did not clearly delineate\\" splicing. =Conspiracy theories= False stories about \\"Antifa buses\\" caused panic in rural counties throughout the country, despite there being no evidence that they exist. The Associated Press has cataloged at least five separate rural counties where locals have warned of imminent attacks, although none of the rumors have been substantiated. As a result of the rumors, several people have been harassed, including a multi-racial family in Forks, Washington. Hundreds of members of armed self-proclaimed militias and far right groups gathered in Gettysburg National Military Park on Independence Day in response to a fake online claim that antifa protesters were planning on burning the U.S. flag. Some social media users spread images of damage from other protests or incidents, falsely attributing the damage to the George Floyd protests. Some users claimed a man videoed breaking the windows of an AutoZone in Minneapolis on May 27 was an undercover Saint Paul Police officer; the Saint Paul Police Department denied these claims through a statement on Twitter. Additionally, SPPD released a montage of surveillance videos in an effort to prove that the officer who was accused of smashing the windows was actually away when the incident occurred. The man accused of smashing the windows of the AutoZone was later identified by authorities as a white supremacist agitator.Weill, Kelly and Bredderman, William (July 28, 2020). \\"This Is the Alleged White Supremacist ‚ÄòUmbrella Man‚Äô Police Suspect of Minneapolis Chaos\\". The Daily Beast. Retrieved on July 28, 2020. Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts associated with spreading a false claim about a communications blackout during protests in Washington, D.C., or a claim that authorities had blocked protesters from communicating on their smartphones. Also, some accounts shared a photo of a major fire burning near the Washington Monument, which was actually an image from a television show. Social effects Economic impact = Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted on June 10 \\"historically high unemployment\\" prevalent during the prelude of the protests. According to Fortune, the economic impact of the protests has exacerbated the 2020 coronavirus recession by sharply curtailing consumer confidence, straining local businesses, and overwhelming public infrastructure with large-scale property damage. A number of small businesses, already suffering from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, were harmed by vandalism, property destruction, and looting.Leticia Miranda, First came a pandemic. Then, looting. Small businesses pick up the pieces as their debt mounts., NBC News (June 4, 2020).Russell Lynch, US riots set to scar economy for years to come, The Telegraph (June 6, 2020). Curfews instated by local governments ‚Äì in response to both the pandemic and protests ‚Äì have also \\"restricted access to the downtown [areas]\\" to essential workers, lowering economic output. President Donald Trump, after announcing a drop in overall unemployment from 14.7% to 13.3% on June 5, stated that strong economic growth was \\"the greatest thing [for race relations]\\" and \\"George Floyd would have been proud [of the unemployment rate]\\". That same day reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the unemployment rate among African Americans (covering the first two weeks of protests) was up 0.1%, rising to 16.8%. The U.S. stock market has remained unaffected or otherwise increased since the start of the protests on May 26. The protest's first fortnight coincided with a 38% rise in the stock market. A resurgence of coronavirus (facilitated by mass protests) could exacerbate the 2020 stock market crash according to economists at RBC. The protests have disrupted national supply chains over uncertainty regarding public safety, a resurgence of COVID-19, and consumer confidence. Several Fortune 500 retail companies, with large distribution networks, have scaled back deliveries and shuttered stores in high-impact areas. Mass demonstrations ‚Äì of both peaceful and violent varieties ‚Äì have been linked to diminished consumer confidence and demand stemming from the public health risks of group gatherings amid COVID-19. A looted leftLarge- scale property damage stemming from the protests has led to increased insurance claims, bankruptcies, and curbed economic activity among small businesses and state governments. Insurance claims arising from property damage suffered in rioting is still being assessed, but is thought to be significant, perhaps record-breaking.Jim Sams, Insured Losses from Riots Reach 'Catastrophe' Levels, May Rival Record, Claims Journal (June 2, 2020). The City of Minneapolis' Community Planning & Economic Development Department gave an early estimate of at least 220 buildings damaged and $55 million in property damage in the city from fires and vandalism, centered on the Lake Street area; city and state officials have requested state and federal aid to rebuild and repair.Jessie Van Berkel & Liz Navratil, Mayor Frey seeks federal, state aid for Minneapolis, with early estimate showing at least $55M in damage, Star Tribune (June 4, 2020).Damage from fires, vandalism in Minneapolis at $55 million and counting, city says, Associated Press (June 4, 2020). Later estimates projected damages to be upwards of $500 million. Among the losses was Minnehaha Commons, an under-construction, $30 million redevelopment project for 189 units of affordable housing, which was destroyed by fire after being torched on May 27.Burl Gilyard, Riots Destroy $30M Affordable Housing Project , Twin Cities Business (May 28, 2020).Jim Buchta, Minneapolis vandalism targets include 189-unit affordable housing development, Star Tribune (May 28, 2020). A community organization in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood said that between $10 million and $15 million in property damage (excluding losses from looting) was incurred over the weekend of May 29‚Äì31, mostly along storefronts along Peachtree Street and Phipps Plaza.Andy Peters, Buckhead protest damaged tabbed at $10 million to $15 million, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (June 1, 2020). The damage to downtown Chicago's central business district (near the Magnificent Mile) was reported to have sustained \\"millions of dollars in damage\\" according to Fortune. Public financing and funding, particularly on the state level, has also been impacted by the protests. The coronavirus recession has eroded large parts of state budgets which have, subsequently, struggled to finance the police Overtime pay, security costs, and infrastructure repairs related to the demonstrations. State governments have, since June, announced budget cuts to police departments as well as increased funding to other public safety measures. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced on June 5 he will seek up to $150 million in cuts to the Los Angeles Police Department budget. On May 31, Walmart temporarily closed several hundred of its stores as a precaution. Amazon announced it would redirect some delivery routes and scale back others as a result of the widespread unrest. = Monuments and symbols= monument of Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia, on July 1, 2020 Scrutiny of, discussion of removal, and removal of civic symbols or names relating to the Confederate States of America (frequently associated with segregation and the Jim Crow era in the United States) has regained steam as protests have continued. On June 4, 2020, Virginia governor Ralph Northam announced the Robert E. Lee Monument in Richmond would be removed. On June 5, making specific reference to events in Charlottesville in 2017, the United States Marine Corps banned the display of the Confederate Battle Flag at their installations. The United States Navy followed suit on June 9 at the direction of Michael M. Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations. Birmingham, Alabama Mayor Randall Woodfin ordered the removal of the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Linn Park. The Alabama Attorney General has filed suit against the city of Birmingham for violating the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act. A statue of America's first president, George Washington, has been torn down and American flag was burned by rioters in Portland, Oregon. Portland Public Schools was responding after protesters pulled down the Thomas Jefferson statue in front of Jefferson High School. Several protesters tore down the statue of the third President of the United States and wrote: ‚Äúslave owner‚Äù and ‚ÄúGeorge Floyd‚Äù in spray paint at its white marble base. PPS officials said they recognize that the act is part of a larger and very important national conversation. The statues targeted included a bust of Ulysses S. Grant and statue of Theodore Roosevelt. BLM activist Shaun King tweeted that statues, murals, and stained glass windows depicting a white Jesus should be removed. Protesters defaced a statue of Philadelphia abolitionist Matthias Baldwin with the words \\"murderer\\" and \\"colonizer\\". Protesters in San Francisco vandalized a statue of Miguel de Cervantes, a Spanish writer who spent five years as a slave in Algiers. Vandals defaced the statue of Winston Churchill in London's Parliament Square and Queen Victoria's statue in Leeds. The Lincoln Memorial, the World War II Memorial and the statue of General Casimir Pulaski were vandalized during the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C. On June 7, the statue of Edward Colston was toppled and thrown into Bristol Harbour by demonstrators during the George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom. BLM activists in London are calling for the removal of 60 statues of historical figures like Prime Ministers Charles Grey and William Gladstone, Horatio Nelson, Sir Francis Drake, King Charles II of England, Oliver Cromwell and Christopher Columbus. Protesters in Belgium have vandalized statues of King Leopold II of Belgium. In Washington, D.C., a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in front of the Indian Embassy was vandalized on the intervening night of June 2 and 3. The incident prompted the embassy to register a complaint with law enforcement agencies. Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian Ambassador to the United States, called the vandalism \\"a crime against humanity\\". In London, another statue of Gandhi was vandalized by Black Lives Matter protesters along with the statue of Winston Churchill. On June 12, the city council in Hamilton, New Zealand removed the statue of Captain John Hamilton, a British officer who was killed during the New Zealand Wars in 1864. A local MƒÅori elder Taitimu Maipi, who had vandalized the statue in 2018, has also called for the city to be renamed Kirikiriroa. New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters called the scrutiny of colonial-era memorials a \\"wave of idiocy\\". The pedestal of a Christopher Columbus statue that was thrown into the Baltimore inner harbor on July 4, 2020 On June 22, a crowd of rioters unsuccessfully attempted to topple Clark Mills' 1852 bronze equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square in President's Park, directly north of the White House in Washington, D.C.(1) . (2) . Several days later, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) charged four men with destruction of federal property for allegedly trying to bring down the statue. The Justice Department alleged that a video showed one of the men breaking off and destroying the wheels of the cannons located at the base of the statue as well as pulling on ropes when trying to bring down the statue.(1) (2) . Soon afterwards, the DOJ announced the arrest and charging of a man who was not only allegedly seen on video climbing up onto the Jackson statue and affixing a rope that was then used to try to pull the statue down, but had on June 20 helped destroy Gaetano Trentanove's 1901 Albert Pike Memorial statue near Washington's Judiciary Square by pulling it from its base and setting it on fire. The DOJ's complaint alleged that the man had been captured on video dousing the federally-owned Pike statue with a flammable liquid, igniting it as it lay on the ground and using the fire to light a cigarette.(1) (2) . (3) . On , after the Mississippi Legislature obtained a two-thirds majority in both houses to suspend rules in order to pass a bill addressing the Confederate Battle Flag on the Mississippi state flag, Governor Tate Reeves signed a bill that relinquished the state flag, mandated its removal from public premises within 15 days, and established a commission to propose a new flag design that excluded the Confederate Battle Flag and included the motto \\"In God We Trust\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcdc5tOZbc8 The flag contained the infamous Confederate symbol in the canton (upper left corner) of the flag, and was the last U.S. state flag to do so. During a speech on July 3 at Mount Rushmore, U.S. president Donald Trump denounced the monument removals as part of a \\"left wing cultural revolution\\" to \\"overthrow the American revolution\\". On , the Washington Redskins announced that their name and logo would be retired upon completion of \\"a thorough review of the name\\" that was first announced on . A week-long tour began July 28 in which a hologram of Floyd was projected on a monument to be removed, thereby \\"replacing\\" the monument with Floyd. Richmond, Virginia was the first stop. = Impact on police activity = take a knee during protests in Philadelphia on June 2 According to Lt. Bob Kroll, the head of the Minneapolis police union, officers began retiring \\"en masse\\" alongside morale being at an \\"all-time low\\". Around 170 Atlanta police officers walked off of the job in mid-June following unresolved grievances in Rayshard Brooks case. The New York City Police Department reported a 411% increase in police retirement application in the first week of July. As a result, the Department has limited new retirement applications to 40 a day.  Injuries  On July 11, at least 150 Minneapolis police officers reported nondescript injuries as well as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, leading over half of them to leave their jobs with more likely to follow. The Minneapolis police have denied there being any serious injuries inflicted on officers.  Changes to police policies  In the wake of Floyd's killing, state and local governments evaluated their police department policies, and the response to protests, for themselves. For example, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for new police crowd control procedures for the state, and the banning of the police use of carotid chokeholds, which starve the brain of oxygen. The Minneapolis police department banned police from using chokeholds; Denver's police department also banned the use of chokeholds without exception, and also established new reporting requirements whenever a police officer holds a person at gunpoint. In June 2020, Democrats in Congress introduced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a police reform and accountability bill that contains measures to combat police misconduct, excessive force, and racial bias in policing. The impetus for the bill were the killings of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other African Americans at the hands of police.Leigh Ann Caldwell & Rebecca Shabad, Congressional Democrats unveil sweeping police reform bill that would ban chokeholds, no-knock warrants in drug cases, NBC News (June 8, 2020). It passed the House of Representatives one month after Floyd's killing, 236 to 181, with support from Democrats and three Republicans. A Republican reform bill was blocked in the U.S. Senate by all but two Democrats; neither party negotiated the contents of the bill with the other. Speaker Nancy Pelosi summarized Democratic opposition to the Senate bill: \\"it's not a question that it didn't go far enough; it didn't go anywhere\\". \\"Defund the Police\\", a phrase popularized by BLM during the George Floyd protests On June 16, President Trump signed an executive order on police reform that incentivized departments to recruit from communities they patrol, encourage more limited use of deadly force, and prioritize using social workers and mental health professionals for nonviolent calls. The order also created a national database of police officers with a history of using excessive force. On September 10, Ted Wheeler, the mayor and police commissioner of Portland, Oregon, banned city police from using tear gas for riot control purposes, but reiterated that police would respond to violent protests forcefully. Portland has seen over a 100 consecutive days of protests since they began on May 28.  Push to abolish police  Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council ‚Äî a veto-proof majority ‚Äî pledged on June 7 to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department, despite opposition from Mayor Frey. U.S. representative Ilhan Omar stated, \\"the Minneapolis Police Department has proven themselves beyond reform. It's time to disband them and reimagine public safety in Minneapolis.\\" Despite pledges by city council members to the end the Minneapolis Police Department, a proposed amendment to the Minneapolis city charter which was approved by the Minneapolis City Council on June 26 would only rename the police department and change its structure if approved by voters. = Impact on entertainment = Television and films  In the media industry, the protests have spurred scrutiny for cop shows and led to the cancellation of popular television shows referred to by critics as copaganda. With long-standing criticism that it presented an unbalanced view of law enforcement in favor of police, encouraged police to engage in more dramatic behavior for the camera, and degraded suspects who had not yet been convicted of any crime, the Paramount Network canceled the 33rd season of the TV show Cops and pulled it from broadcast. The television network A&E; canceled a similar show, Live PD, which was also found to have destroyed footage documenting the police killing of Javier Ambler in Austin, Texas, in 2019. The streaming service HBO Max temporarily pulled the film Gone with the Wind until video that explains and condemns the film's racist depictions could be produced to accompany it. In the United Kingdom, the BBC pulled the famed \\"The Germans\\" episode of Fawlty Towers from its UKTV streaming service, but later reinstated it after criticism from series star and co-writer John Cleese. He later criticized their use of the word \\"fury\\" to describe his comments. This was later removed by the BBC. The episode, which included racial slurs about the West Indies cricket team, now features a disclaimer at the beginning warning of \\"offensive content and language\\". The BBC also removed the Little Britain series and its spinoff Come Fly with Me from the iPlayer and BritBox services as well as Netflix for its use of blackface. The week of June 24, 2020, several animated series that had black, mixed or non-white characters voiced by white actors, including Big Mouth, Central Park, Family Guy and The Simpsons, announced those characters would be recast with people of color. That same week, episodes of 30 Rock, The Office, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Community, The Golden Girls, and Peep Show that involved characters using blackface were either removed or edited from syndication and streaming services. In light of the protests, Brooklyn Nine- Nine co-star Terry Crews said that the first four episodes of the show's eighth season had to be rewritten.  Theme parks  Popular Disney amusement ride Splash Mountain will be re-themed into a The Princess and the Frog-themed ride. Despite Disney stating the plan was on the works since 2019, fans believed the re-theming was responding to protests as the current attraction was based on the film Song of the South, a controversial film for its depiction of African-Americans. =Impact on brand marketing= In reaction to the higher sensitivity by customers for racial issues, multiple companies decided to rebrand some products. Examples: * Aunt Jemima * Uncle Ben's, will be renamed in 2021 to Ben's Original * Fair & Lovely, new name: Glow & Lovely =Firearms= The unrest was followed by an unprecedented number of firearms being transferred inside of the United States. Background checks for legally purchased firearms reached record highs in May with year- on-year numbers up 80.2%. In June 2020 the FBI reported running 3.9 million NICS checks for persons purchasing a firearm or firearms. This represented the highest monthly number of firearms transfers since the FBI began keeping records in 1998. Firearms retailers surveyed by National Shooting Sports Foundation in May estimated that 40% of their sales came from first-time gun buyers, 40% of those first-time gun buyers were women, a relatively high rate for that demographic group. Though gun sales have been up across the country, a rise in first-time gun buyers in left-leaning states like California have helped fuel the national uptick in firearms and ammunition purchases.; ; June 2020 represented the largest month of firearms purchases in United States history, with Illinois purchasing more firearms than any other state. The last days of May and first week of June, there were more than 90 attempted or successful burglaries of gun stores, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. More than 1,000 guns were stolen in that window of time. On May 31 alone the BATF reported 29 separate burglaries targeting licensed firearm retailers. Impact on COVID-19 transmissionConcerns by officials= The mass protests occurred during the global COVID-19 pandemic and officials and experts warned they could facilitate an accelerated or rebounding spread of COVID-19. A number of current and former public health officials expressed concerns that mass protests would lead to a spike in COVID-19 clusters, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci, and former Trump administration FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. These concerns were echoed by a number of elected officials, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, Abroad, Australia Health Minister Greg Hunt. and British Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to avoid mass gatherings. Martin Seychell, a health official at the EU Commission, said that mass events could be a major route of transmission like for any infectious respiratory disease and that the likelihood and size of a second wave would depend on the effective maintaining of social distancing measures and other factors. Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Nottingham University, England stated there is \\"clear evidence that banning mass gatherings was one of the most effective and important parts of the lockdowns across European countries\\". While expressing disappointment at the flouting of social distancing rules, Police Minister Stuart Nash indicated that New Zealand Police were not seeking to prosecute protest organizers and participants. A number of officials, including Cuomo, Bottoms, and Minnesota health officials, recommended that anyone who attended a demonstration receive COVID-19 testing. Multiple governors attended street protests even though they appeared to violate their own orders to ensure social distancing. =Factors = Masked protesters in Philadelphia on June 2 In June 2020 the CDC released the \\"Considerations for Events and Gatherings\\" which assesses large gatherings where it is difficult for people to stay at least six feet apart, and where attendees travel from outside the local area as \\"highest risk\\".  Masks and distancing  Speaking about public health implications of demonstrations, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that \\"Masks can help, but it's masks plus physical separation\\". Ashish Jha, Director of the Global Health Institute at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said, \\"The question is: how do we do protesting safely? I think masks are a critical part of it.\\" Theodore Long, a doctor affiliated with New York's contact tracing strategy, echoed Jha's point, and advocated \\"proper hand hygiene and to the extent possible, socially distance\\". Many participants of the protests with potentially unclear current and prior-infection-status ‚Äì including some police officers ‚Äì did not wear a face mask at all times, or adhere to other public safety guidelines. George Floyd's family encouraged those attending the official public memorial to wear masks and gloves, as did multiple officials, including Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney who asked demonstrators to follow social distancing guidelines, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo who asked protesters to wear masks, and Minnesota's governor who warned that \\"too many\\" protesters were not applying physical person-to-person distances or wearing masks.  Overcrowded jails  Hundreds of people arrested by police in New York City ‚Äì including both peaceful demonstrators and persons accused of violence ‚Äì were detained in overcrowded, sometimes unsanitary holding cells, sometimes without face masks, prompting concerns over jail-spread COVID-19 cases. The Legal Aid Society sued the New York City Police Department, accusing it of detaining people for extended periods (up to three days) in violation of New York state law requiring that arrests receive arraignments within 24 hours. The department acknowledged that \\"it was common for up to two dozen people to be held for hours on buses before being taken to be booked\\" due to large backlogs and paperwork delays and that social distancing was impossible within jails, but a state trial court denied Legal Aid's request, given the \\"crisis within a crisis\\".  Other factors  A protester in Vancouver, Canada, with \\"Please give me space. I am diabetic and more [susceptible] to COVID-19\\" written on their shirt The use of tear gas may increase the spread of the virus due to coughing and lung damage. Smoke and pepper spray may also increase its spread. Shouting and speaking loudly, which are common to both violent and non-violent protests, may also cause infections at distances greater than . Research has found that the share of infections due to a single infected person in a choir can be almost 90%, and that just a few contagious people can infect hundreds of susceptible people around them. Outdoor events may have a substantially lower risk of spreading the disease than indoor ones, and the \\"transient\\" moments of people moving around may be less-hazardous than longer durations of proximity. =Debate over weighing of risks = Over 1,200 medical staff signed a letter criticizing what they called \\"emerging narratives that seemed to malign demonstrations as risky for the public health because of Covid-19\\". The letter writers wrote: > Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at > minimizing the spread of COVID-19. To the extent possible, we support the > application of these public health best practices during demonstrations that > call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy. However, as > public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for > COVID-19 transmission. We support them as vital to the national public > health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the > United States. We can show that support by facilitating safest protesting > practices without detracting from demonstrators' ability to gather and > demand change. This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all > gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders. Most protesters in Minneapolis interviewed by Wired magazine said they \\"participated with full knowledge of the health risks, and believe police brutality to be an even more urgent existential threat\\". Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director, said that if trust in government \\"is undermined by violent policing, or it's undermined by ham-handed public health actions that don't respect communities, that's going to have a negative impact on our ability to fight disease\\". Frieden has faced considerable backlash for these remarks, most notably from Jonah Goldberg. Criticisms also arose of health officials and physicians potentially \\"politicizing science\\", as officials have given varying responses for different protests. Thomas Chatterton Williams said \\"the public health narrative around coronavirus ... reversed itself overnight\\" in the wake of the protests. Glenn Greenwald also criticized the response of public health officials and epidemiologists, asking, \\"How is it remotely within the scope of the expertise of epidemiologists to pick and choose which political protests should be permitted and/or encouraged and which ones banned and/or denounced?\\" = Preliminary results = An Indiana National Guardsman from the 76th Infantry Brigade talks to a Washington, D.C. resident at the National Mall on June 6 Researchers reported that the protests did not appear to be driving an increase in coronavirus transmission. A study issued in June 2020 by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private non-profit organization, found \\"no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset\\", as well as \\"no evidence that net COVID-19 case growth differentially rose following the onset of Black Lives Matter protests, and even modest evidence of a small longer-run case growth decline\\". Epidemiologists and other researchers suggested the protests had a relatively low impact on COVID-19 transmission because the protests took place outdoors where the virus is less likely to spread as compared to indoors; because many protesters wore masks; and because persons who demonstrated made up a small portion of the overall U.S. population (about 6% of adults). Authorities did not report increases in coronavirus cases as a result of the protests in New York City, or in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, or Seattle, Washington. Minnesota launched an effort to test people who demonstrated, and found that 1.5% tested positive. Similarly in Massachusetts, fewer than 3% tested positive. On June 17 and 18, Massachusetts administered free COVID-19 testing and reported that 2.5% tested positive, which was \\"reasonably consistent\\" with the general population testing positive at 1.9%. In King County, Washington, less than 5% of 1,008 total positive cases were traced by health investigators to persons who attended a protest. In contrast, the Director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health asserted on June 22 that it was \\"highly likely\\" that a surge in cases is connected to the protests, as well as the lifting of the county stay-at-home order. Jeffrey Shaman of Columbia University found that, of three modeled scenarios with mask-wearing and open air suppressing transmission, \\"the most optimistic scenario turned out to be most accurate.\\" However, Shaman and other researchers and officials caution that protesters are disproportionately young, and less likely to become ill, and there is significant uncertainty about the effect of various factors. While many states in the U.S. saw record highs of new cases, these upticks are thought to be attributed to reopenings of workplaces, bars, restaurants, and other businesses. In June, a large number of Houston Police Department officers tested positive for the virus or were quarantined after being exposed; police chief Art Acevedo said that none of the officers were seriously ill, and suggested that business reopenings in Texas were more likely the cause of the spread among officers than protest duty, saying \\"We opened up the state very quickly, especially bars and, you know, I can't control what people do off duty.\\" Members of the D.C. National Guard have also tested positive for COVID-19 after protests.  Reactions  U.S. president Donald Trump walks to St. John's Church amid protests in Washington, D.C. on June 1, 2020 Many countries, companies, organizations, and celebrities worldwide sent messages of concern about the George Floyd killing and protests. Some television channels blacked out regular programming for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in solidarity with the protests while some celebrities and companies made donations to racial justice organizations. Some politicians also participated in the protests, while others called for protesters to refrain from violence. U.S. president Donald Trump demanded that state governors \\"dominate\\" protesters, and tweeted \\"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\\", a sentiment which Twitter marked as inciting violence. Trump later said he was not advocating violence, noting that the tweet could be read as either a threat or a statement of fact and that he intended for it to be read as \\"a combination of both\\". Trump controversially deployed various federal law enforcement agencies, the District of Columbia National Guard, and the Arlington County Police Department to clear Lafayette Square and surrounding streets for a photo-op at St. John's Church.

Throughout his career, his work remained focused on advertising. He wrote considerably about female nudity in advertisements, ethical concerns related to it, and the impact of arousal in advertisements.

Barnes was born in Stockport in 1817. He emigrated to Port Chalmers aboard the Nourmabal, arriving in May 1858, where he began business as a carter and contractor, ferrying goods to the goldfields, and contracting for public works. He held contracts for the construction of Rattray Street, Stuart Street, Pelichet Bay jetties, and a part of the Port Chalmers railway. Barnes was elected to the Town Board in 1863 and the new Town Council in 1866. Barnes was also appointed inspector of works in 1877, and ultimately mayor in 1885, despite his ‚Äòcrudity of language, hot temper and lack of social graces‚Äô. He may be the Inspector of Works Barnes who was reported in a 'precarious' position after an assault by another contractor, John Thomson, in 1876. Barnes resigned as councillor twice in order to take a position as inspector of works. In 1886, Barnes's son was supervising a blasting operation in Dowling Street which killed two women in their house. Barnes's close involvement in the works led to questions afterwards. Barnes died in Dunedin on 18 November 1889, having failed to recover from internal injuries received from a fall from a horse at Milton 18 months earlier.

She and her unit were praised for their service in support of the Australian soldiers.  Early life  Florence Elizabeth James-Wallace was born in 1886 at Killarney Station, St Lawrence, Queensland. She was the fifth child of John Thornhill James-Wallace and his wife Marie Bernard. After the death of her father, the family moved to Brisbane and Florence trained as a nurse at the Brisbane General Hospital. She gained her Nursing Certificate in 1910. She took a position in Wellington, New Zealand and then returned to Australia to work in Longreach, Queensland. When World War I broke out, her elder brother joined the AIF and Florence joined the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) in Brisbane. She was assigned to Unit 3, Australian General Hospital (3AGH) on the 26th April, 1915.  War Service  James-Wallace and her hospital unit left Australia in May 1915, expecting to serve in France after first landing in England. After disembarking in London, they were dispatched to Mudros, on the Greek Island of Lemnos, fifty miles from where the ANZAC units were fighting in Gallipoli, Turkey. Arriving in early August, in advance of their hospital supply ship they were compelled to treat casualties the day after their arrival. They had no clean water or medical supplies with which to begin. Australian Sisters on board Mooltan - Tasmanian Sisters on board, 1915 A.W. Savage James-Wallace and the nurses of the 3AGH spent five months on Lemnos. She and her unit's experiences were photographed by Private Albert William Savage and James-Wallace purchased over 116 photographs from Savage. The last Australians were evacuated from Gallipoli on the night of 19/20 December 1915 as the campaign was disbanded. After Christmas on Lemnos the hospitals were disbanded and James-Wallace and the 3AGH nurses sailed on the 14th January, 1916 to a port in Egypt. The nurses were stationed in Abbassia, Egypt for 8 months before being sent to Brighton, England and then Abbeville, France where they served until August 1918. She and the other nurses worked in Casualty Clearing Stations near Bapaume and Villers-Bretonneux, which saw heavy shelling and some of the worst casualties. They joined the 1st Australian Auxiliary Hospital in Harefield, England in late August 1918. James-Wallace was mentioned in despatches. James-Wallace returned to Australia in 1919, disembarking in Melbourne before being discharged on the 23rd May 1919. Like other serving soldiers, she received the 1914-15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal in recognition of her war service. As part of the Soldier Settlement program offered by the Commonwealth to returning veterans, James-Wallace was allotted a land portion of the Waterworks Road Soldier Settlement - Enoggera parish in The Gap in Brisbane.  Later life  James- Wallace first lived with her sister and mother in Wynnum after her return to Brisbane. However rheumatism and arthritis, brought on by the cold damp conditions at the hospitals on Lemnos and in France, which was a common experience amongst many of the army nurses, prevented her return to full-time nursing. She rested and nursed privately part-time, living in her home at The Gap. After 1923, when she gave up her soldier settlement, she accepted a position as a nurse in Auckland. She married Harry Oswald Mellsop in Auckland in 1927.  Legacy  Florence Mellsop visited her family in Queensland many times over the next three decades but continuing ill health from her war service confined her to hospital for an extensive period. On her final visit to Australia she left the photo albums of her time spent in the AANC with her Australian family. She died in New Zealand in 1970. Her photo albums were donated to the Fryer Library, The University of Queensland where they have been digitised.

The most common adverse reactions include headache, injection site pain and increased blood pressure. Two proteins ‚Äì tau and amyloid ‚Äì are recognized as hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. In people with Alzheimer's disease, pathological forms of tau proteins develop inside neurons in the brain, creating neurofibrillary tangles. After flortaucipir (18F) is administered intravenously, it binds to sites in the brain associated with this tau protein misfolding. The brain can then be imaged with a PET scan to help identify the presence of tau pathology. It is the first drug used to help image a distinctive characteristic of Alzheimer's disease in the brain called tau pathology.  Medical uses  Flortaucipir (18F) is a radioactive diagnostic agent for adults with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease. It is indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a primary marker of Alzheimer's disease. Flortaucipir (18F) is not indicated for use in the evaluation of people for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).  Chemistry  Chemically, flortaucipir F 18 is 7-(6-[F-18]fluoropyridin-3-yl)-5H-pyrido[4,3 b]indole.  History  Flortaucipir (18F) was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020. The safety and effectiveness of flortaucipir (18F) imaging was evaluated in two clinical studies. In each study, five evaluators read and interpreted the flortaucipir (18F) imaging. The evaluators were blinded to clinical information and interpreted the imaging as positive or negative. The first study enrolled 156 participants who were terminally ill and agreed to undergo flortaucipir (18F) imaging and participate in a post-mortem brain donation program. In 64 of the participants who died within nine months of the flortaucipir (18F) brain scan, evaluators' reading of the flortaucipir (18F) scan was compared to post-mortem readings from independent pathologists who evaluated the density and distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the same brain. The study showed evaluators reading the flortaucipir (18F) images had a high probability of correctly evaluating participants with tau pathology and had an average-to-high probability of correctly evaluating participants without tau pathology. The second study included the same participants with terminal illness as the first study, plus 18 additional participants with terminal illness, and 159 participants with cognitive impairment being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (the indicated patient population). The study gauged how well flortaucipir (18F) evaluators' readings agreed with each other's assessments of the readings. Perfect reader agreement would be 1, while no reader agreement would be 0. In this study, reader agreement was 0.87 across all 241 participants. In a separate subgroup analysis that included the 82 terminally ill participants diagnosed after death and the 159 participants with cognitive impairment, reader agreement was 0.90 for the participants in the indicated population and 0.82 in the terminally ill participants. The FDA approved flortaucipir (18F) based on evidence of 1921 participants from 19 trials conducted at 322 sites in the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, Netherlands and Poland. The ability of flortaucipir (18F) to detect tau pathology was assessed in participants with generally severe stages of dementia and may be lower in participants in earlier stages of cognitive decline than in the participants with terminal illness who were studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for flortaucipir (18F) priority review and it granted approval of Tauvid to Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc.

His biographer Charles B. Strozier has called it a masterpiece.Strozier 2001, p.221. Kohut wrote the book in his late 50's, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He sent the finished manuscript to his publisher in the spring of 1970. The book is written from the vantage point of Freudian ego psychology, but he throws the drive theory overboard and treats the subject matter of narcissism from many different vantage points. He opens new perspectives into the development of the human child, and renders the Oedipus complex irrelevant. He presents new clinical ideas, with which it is possible to treat severely disturbed patients, who had prior to this been considered untreatable in classical psychoanalysis.Strozier 2001, p.193‚Äì194. In his book, Kohut deals with a new category of patients, those suffering from narcissistic personality disorders, or at least this was a group of patients that had previously not been treated within psychoanalysis but which were now seen in a different light.Strozier 2001, p.195 Kohut's work is divided into three parts, with a separate introductory chapter. This introductory chapter was written last, when Kohut's younger colleagues told him that the book should have this kind of an introduction. Thus the book begins with a concise summary of the work. The book deal with the so-called narcissistic transferences. Part I deals with the idealizing transference, which is directed toward the analyst, when the so-called omnipotent object is activated in the patient. Part II deals with mirror transferences, which emerge when feelings of grandiosity arise in the patients (the grandiose self emerges), in one of its three manifestations. Before Kohut, no one had been able to conceptualize the narcissistic attitudes and problems of the narcissistic patients with concepts such as these.Kohut 1971.Strozier 2001, p.193‚Äì194. Kohut's theory is in equal parts phenomenological and developmental. The idea is to say that narcissism has its own developmental line, which is different from the developmental line of object love in the old Freudian theory. Kohut maintains that the developmental line of narcissism is parallel to that of object love, but this is only a smokescreen, designed to calm down orthodox Freudians, who would otherwise been up on their hind legs. Analysis has the same significance for narcissism as Freud's Interpretation of Dreams had for the unconscious. ‚ÄúAnalysis creates an idea of the self as a separate, holistic concept for the contemporary psychological thought. The instincts fade away as Kohut embraces human beings rather than victims of drives,‚Äù writes Kohut's biographer Charles B. Strozier. What emerges is a practice in which the analyst is emotionally involved in the patient's life. The theory is ‚Äúflexible, open-ended, mutual and empathic. Analysis makes possible the pure gold of psychotherapy.‚ÄùStrozier 2001, p.194. Kohut is interested in the way we are in relationships with other people, not only in whether such relationship exists between people or not. This is one of his most important contributions to psychoanalysis. His most important ideas is probably that the human self can not exist anywhere else but in such a context of human relations, in a web of selfobjects. A human being uses other human beings in order to create psychological structures, and as a part of this process, the developing human being feels that other people are part of his or her self. This is what the term selfobject means. In the end, when a human individual is fully developed, there is no autonomy or separateness, but more and more profound unity with other human beings. The human being always has a need for selfobjects and longs to be in complex relationships with them.Strozier 2001, p.195. Kohut's narcissistically disturbed patients suffered from human relationships, in which the others had been cathected with archaic narcissistic libido, and therefore these objects were experienced as part of the self. The people were stuck in an archaic developmental phase, and thus to archaic psychological configurations, but what is important is that they also had a potential for development and therefore for healing.Strozier 2001, p.196. Narcissistic patients often initially present feelings of emptiness and of depression, which are eased when a narcissistic transference has emerged. When there are disruptions in the transference, the patients feel unreal and numb, and they have hypochondriac fears and their energies are gone. The central problem of these patients lie in their self-esteem, which is low and unreliable, and they are vulnerable and easily irritated.Strozier 2001, p.196. The narcissistic transferences are new versions of childhood human relations gone awry. With the grandiose self, the attitude is ‚ÄúI am perfect‚Äù, whereas with the idealized parent imago it is ‚Äúyou are perfect, but I am part of you‚Äù. These attitudes can be discerned in children and in psychoanalytic patients when they have attained the level of the cohesive self. With favourable development, grandiosity will develop into ambitions of an adult person, and the idealizing attitude will develop into our deepest ideals, against which we measure ourselves and from which we expect guidance and directions for our actions. Childhood trauma interfere with these developments, and these configurations are repressed and their psychological energies are not available to the individual, resulting in a low self-esteem. It is precisely these damaged structures of the self that are activated in selfobject transferences, and they will then be drawn into the processes of transmuting internalization, and in time they will result in a healthy self-esteem. Strozier 2001, p.197. The development of the child towards adulthood and that of a patient in an analysis will take place through optimal frustrations and the processes of transmuting internalizations, which take place little by little. With the idealizing transference, the patient will gradually withdraw the idealizing attitude from the analyst, and so new psychological structures and functions can be formed.Strozier 2001, p.199, 201. The Analysis of the Self was written in the language of the drive theory. ‚ÄúKohut‚Äôs theory, in fact, is so pervasively grounded in drive theory that it seems to require it. From the vantage point of 1971, it appeared to Anna Freud, Heinz Hartmann [‚Ä¶], Kurt Eissler and most other leaders in the field, and certainly to Kohut himself, that drive theory had reached a new level of sophistication‚Äù, writes Stroziers, but then he says that this work In addition to this, Strozier writesStrozier 2001, p.224‚Äì225.

It was commissioned by Alan Lane and Miles Standish, successful businessmen in the printing industry, and designed by the Cleveland based Austin Company in 1929. It is an example of late gothic revival architecture, which originated in Europe. The building was originally used as a printing plant but now is used by a management and design company. It is also now connected to a newer apartment building called Lane 1919.  Description  Located at 1539 NW 19th Avenue in Portland, the main building is two stories high with its prominent feature being its castellated rooftop situated atop the main entrance to the building. It also has features inspired by the late gothic revival architecture movement. These features include the previously mentioned castellated rooftop, buttresses and divided window panels. Most of these features are toned down from their European counterparts, like the small white buttresses, which pale in comparison to a building like the Reims Cathedral in France. The exterior is mostly white with some black outlines. Although not used for printing anymore, it still bears the name of the old company adding to the historical context of the building to this day. The main building is about 13,000 square feet and has an apartment building to the side called Lane 1919 that was constructed in 2006.  History  The Lane Miles Standish Printing Company began in 1919 and was started by Alan Lane and Miles Standish, two businessmen. In 1929, they commissioned the building to have a new facility for their company. The late gothic revival architecture idea came from Alan Lane, who was reminded of buildings from his childhood in the area where he grew up. The building is still owned by the surviving relatives of the founders and is now used by a different company not related to the printing business. The building was also recognized by the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in March 2007.

Orefice has made innovative discoveries about the role of peripheral nerves and sensory hypersensitivity in the development of Autism-like behaviors. Her research now focuses on exploring the basic biology of somatosensory neural circuits for both touch and gastrointestinal function in order to shed light on how peripheral sensation impacts brain development and susceptibility to diseases like Autism Spectrum Disorders.  Early life and education  Orefice pursued her undergraduate degree at Boston College. She majored in biology and worked in the lab of Stephen C. Heinrichs. She studied the neurobiological underpinning of seizure susceptibility in mice and published a first author paper in Epilepsy and Behavior. She used mouse models of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) to explore how increased parental investment impacted seizure susceptibility in offspring with IE. She strikingly found that when pups with a genetic susceptibility to seizures are biparentally reared, this decreases the time to first seizure compared to pups that are only reared by a dam. The increased exposure to parenting, by 350% compared to uniparental rearing, was a form of stressor which impacted seizure susceptibility. After completing her Bachelors of Science, Orefice pursued her graduate work in neuroscience at Georgetown University in 2008. She worked under the mentorship of Baoji Xu studying the role of BDNF in dendritic spine morphogenesis in the hippocampus. Her first paper in the lab highlighted the differential roles of two types of BDNF mRNA in spine growth and maturation. She found a form of BDNF mRNA with a short 3‚Äô untranslated region (UTR) that was present in the soma and promoted spine formation. She also found a second form in the dendrites that is locally translated and has a long 3‚Äô UTR and seems to play a role in promoting spine head growth and pruning. Orefice then further probed how dendritic BDNF exerts its effects on synapse maturation and pruning. She found that neuronal activity promoted the translation of local BDNF mRNA in the dendrites, while translation of BDNF in the soma is independent of action potentials. Further, neuronal activity also promotes the secretion of proBDNF from the dendrite which then effects pruning via binding to the p75NTR receptor. This work fascinatingly highlighted the distinct pathways and translational regulation of somatic versus dendritic BDNF. Orefice completed her graduate training in 2013.  Career and research  In 2014, Orefice pursued her postdoctoral work in the lab of David Ginty at Harvard Medical School. In the Ginty Lab, Orefice studied the peripheral somatosensory system, a substantial change from her prior work in the central nervous system. Orefice reported in an interview with Harvard Medical School that this large field change helped her to see that broad research concepts and skills can easily be transferred between fields and are critical in long-term development as a scientist. During her postdoctoral work, Orefice discovered that dysfunction at the level of peripheral somatosensory neurons accounted for touch over-reactivity in ASD models as well as the development of both social defects and anxiety like behavior. She later targeted hyperactivity of peripheral neurons using an agonist for inhibitory neurons and was able to ameliorate ASD-like behaviors in rodent models of ASD. In 2019, Orefice was promoted to Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital as well as Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard University. She is the principal investigator of the Orefice Lab and her research focuses on understanding the basic biology of the somatosensory circuits that mediate touch and sensations within the gastrointestinal system. She is particularly interested in exploring the development and function of peripheral sensory neurons that innervate internal organs since these might mediate the brain-gut connection to influence behavior and brain-related disease. They further explore how somatosensory processing is aberrant in ASD and how GI dysfunction in ASD might be mediated at the level of the periphery. Lastly, the lab hopes to perform translational work using patient derived iPSCs to move their findings into cellular models and hopefully closer to affecting patients in the clinic. = Peripheral somatosensory neuron dysfunction and autism spectrum disorder = During her postdoctoral work, Orefice made critical discoveries surrounding the role of the peripheral sensory nervous system in the development of autism-like behaviors. It is known that tactile sensitivity is often aberrant in both humans with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as mouse models of ASD. Orefice sought to understand which somatosensory neural circuits were dysfunctional in ASD mouse models as well as how peripheral somatosensory dysfunction contributes to disordered behavioral phenotypes. She deleted ASD-related genes (MeCP2 and Gabrb3) in peripheral neurons and found that absence of these genes, in peripheral tactile neurons only, during development lead to defects in social interaction and anxiety-like behavior later in life. However, when these genes were deleted in the forebrain or during adulthood, there was no somatosensory over-reactivity. When MeCP2 was selectively expressed in only the peripheral sensory neurons, this was enough to restore defects in touch sensitivity, social behavior, and anxiety. Overall, her findings pointing to the periphery as the site at which these ASD mutations exert their influence on sensory over-reactivity and its contribution to ASD phenotypes. Orefice followed these findings to explore the possibility of targeting the peripheral somatosensory neurons therapeutically in ASD models. Since she found that peripheral sensory neuron hyperactivity in development was linked to ASD-like behaviors in adulthood as well as impairments in specific brain circuits, Orefice treated ASD models with peripherally restricted GABAa receptor agonists to increase inhibition at the level of mechanosensory neurons. Peripheral action of this drug led to decreased hypersensitivity and improved some brain circuit dysfunction, anxiety-like behaviors, and social impairments but not the memory and motor defects associated with ASD. Her work points to the potential in modulating peripheral neurons, instead of having to target the brain, as a potential therapy for ASD.

The series follows the lives of Mattie Sullivan (Jake Short), Benji Achebe (Shaquille Ali-Yebuah) and Jack Turner (Jack McMullen), who are young players of a fictional Premier League football team. Produced by BBC Studios and the creators' production company Fudge Park Productions, the inaugural series began broadcasting on BBC Two on 28 May 2020, consisting of six episodes. The first series received underwhelming reviews by critics. Plot Focusing on the lives of young players Mattie, Jack and Benji, the show follows the trio as they contend with the manifold issues on and off the field that are associated with modern-day football. One of the overriding themes of the show, according to Beesley, is the \\"fault lines, where masculinity and insecurity collide\\".

The series, entitled The First Team, was reported to be focused on the lives of players in a fictional Premier League football team, similar to the format of former ITV drama television programme Footballers' Wives. The programme's crew was mainly made up of former members of The Inbetweeners crew, with Beesley and Morris' self-constructed production company Fudge Park Productions collaborating with BBC Studios to produce the series. =Casting= In September 2019, the cast was confirmed, with Jake Short, Shaquille Ali-Yebuah and Jack McMullen set to star. This was the first British production in which Short had appeared - he was previously known for his work for Disney Channel in the United States. It was Ali-Yebuah's first lead role in both television and film. Theo Barklem- Biggs and Tamla Kari were cast in supporting roles, both having appeared in previous Beesley and Morris projects: Barklem-Biggs in The Inbetweeners Movie and Kari in both this and The Inbetweeners 2. Other notable cast members included Will Arnet, Phil Wang and Neil Fitzmaurice. =Filming= The series was filmed across the United Kingdom. The football stadium and training complex was filmed at Charlton Athletic Football Club's facilities: The Valley and their Sparrows Lane training complex. Furthermore, a fan of the programme stated that they had witnessed the programme also being filmed in a local Charlton pub named The Rose of Denmark. When filming in Chester, England international footballer Raheem Sterling was seen at the same Costco store where the crew were filming. It appeared that Sterling was a friend of Shaquille Ali-Yebuah, who portrays the role of Benji Achebe. The scenes where the three main characters visit Petey Brooks's (Theo Barklem-Biggs) home was filmed at a private residence in Sevenoaks, Kent. EpisodesReception The show received underwhelming reviews after its release, being dubbed \\"a football sitcom fit for relegation\\", with 2/5 star reviews in both The Guardian and The Radio Times. The review from The Evening Standard, however, was more positive, asserting that despite a slow start, by episode two, the series \\"feels a lot more confident and funny\\".

While in prison, inmates are expected to work in areas such as industry, institutional maintenance, service tasks and agriculture. The most common work assignments contribute to facility support, such as food service, groundwork, building maintenance and office administration. This work is performed on a full- or part-time basis. However, exceptions include inmates who are medically unable to work, involved in full- time Educational or vocational training programs, or deemed a security risk. The benefits of paid labour for inmates may include heightened incentives for good behaviour, productivity and post-release skill development, in addition to improved emotional wellbeing. Prison institutions are benefited by minimised inmate idleness and potential for security issues, the completion of necessary maintenance tasks and reduced prison operating costs. Labour obligations and wage rates vary across different countries. For instance, prison work assignments are prevalent in the United States, with over half of prisoners being assigned a work program. In Japan, labour is required of all prisoners but options concerning the type of work performed are permitted. Prisoners serving short sentences are not required to work in Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, Lebanon, Syria and Cuba. Paid prison labour is also implemented differently across penal Institutions (i.e. minimum, medium and high-security prisons, correctional facilities and privatised prisons).  Types of work  Maintenance = Prisoners working on a traditional manual Charkha in Pakistan, 2011 The majority of inmates are paid a wage for working in maintenance, custodial or service jobs within the prison. These tasks include cooking meals, maintaining the prison grounds, laundering inmate clothing, repairing boilers and conducting clerical work. On occasion, inmates are involved in labouring for public projects ‚Äì for instance, assisting local communities to repair roads, clearing land and planting trees. In the United States, work that supports the prison institution is managed by the Department of Corrections and remains the most common type of work assignment. This category of tasks is referred to as ‚Äòfacility‚Äô, ‚Äòprison‚Äô or ‚Äòinstitutional‚Äô jobs. The 1973 National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals define prisons as ‚Äòlabour-intensive public service organisations‚Äô characterised by the involvement of paid inmates, contract service workers and employees.' An inmate's knowledge, Skills and their prisoner classification score are considered when making job assignments. In Australia, a prisoner's refusal to work negatively impacts their ‚ÄòEarned Incentive Plan‚Äô level ‚Äì this affects the provision of their inmate privileges, such as television, yard- time and family visits. = Industrial = Prisoners perform industrial work for prisons and private companies. This work involves providing services for sale to government agencies, state-owned or private sector businesses (e.g. data entry, automobile repair) and manufacturing products (e.g. automobile tags, furniture and mattresses). Goods and services are sold at prices designed to cover production costs and business or prison operations. Often called ‚Äòcorrectional industries‚Äô, some Businesses coordinate with correctional agencies to operate ‚Äòshops,‚Äô on which the generated revenues fund their operation. Most inmates are assigned to maintenance rather than industry work. A US nationwide 1991 American Correctional Association survey reported that only 8% of federal and state prisoners had research and industry type jobs. This distribution is a permanent feature of paid prison labour models ‚Äì evidenced by a more recent 2017 figure indicating that agency-operated industries employ approximately 6% of prisoners. = External = Some prison labour programs provide opportunities for inmates to work outside the prison facility] These activities include work release programs, work camps and community work centres that provide services for public and non-profit agencies. In the U.S, these programs are directed by the Department of Corrections and are typically reserved for lower-security risk prisoners and/or those preparing to be released. On the condition that an inmate is physically and mentally capable, participation in these work programs is designed to benefit the community, the Department of Corrections and the inmates themselves. Since 1934, UNICOR has partnered with the U.S Federal Bureau of Prisons. UNICOR operates 83 factories, employing more than 12,000 prisoners for up to US$1.15 per hour to assemble, weld and fabricate products.  Wage payment  Prisons generally incorporate a no-cash system, meaning any amount of money an inmate possesses or earns is stored in a bank account managed by the correctional facility. The accumulated amount of money that a prisoner earns, brings into prison and is sent from family or friends may be used to make purchases (i.e. at the canteen). Any remaining credit is given to the prisoner upon release. During their time in prison, inmates are entitled to monthly printouts of their electronic account balance.Folsom Prison inmates replacing grave markers at Mormon Island Cemetery, 2011 Electronic kiosks are emerging as a more efficient alternative to the traditional paper-based system. Predominantly in private prisons, automated kiosks allow inmates to check their account balance and place their canteen orders. Methods of wage payment vary across prisons. Payment may be based on an hourly rate, cover a time period (i.e. monthly) or be determined on piece work. Inmates may also earn extra for overtime, the longevity of their employment or receive payments through workers‚Äô accident compensation. Some correctional facilities pay prisoners for their participation in educational programs or vocational training. In most cases, wage payments are made weekly based on an hourly rate. Attendance records are kept for all working prisoners. Within the wage levels attributed to each inmate's classification, workers generally begin on their determined minimum wage and proceed to the maximum level according to longevity or proficiency at work. Prison labour wages are characteristically low. In the US, the average daily minimum wage for non-industry penal jobs was US$0.86 in 2017 compared to US$0.93 in 2001. The average daily maximum wage for industry-type work also declined from US$4.73 in 2001 to US$3.45 in 2017. Inmates working for state-owned businesses earned between US$0.33 and US$1.41 per hour in 2017 ‚Äì about twice the amount paid to inmates who work regular prison jobs. With a few exceptions, regular prison jobs (cleaning, groundskeeping, kitchen and clerical work) remain unpaid in the U.S states of Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Texas, Alabama and Arkansas.  Spending wages  While incarcerated, individuals are provided free accommodation, basic toiletries, meals and required clothing. Inmates must purchase phone credit and other goods using the money earned and stored in their prison- managed bank accounts. Most commonly, spending is directed towards the canteen or prison shop. In public prisons, canteens provide essential goods such as tobacco, hobby materials, stationery, non-prescribed medication, additional food and toiletries. Prisoners may also purchase clothing or religious/cultural items from exclusive catalogues. In the U.K, public sector prisons base their inventory on a national product list (NPL) of approved items. However, prisons in the private sector generally rely on their own canteen system. In some penal systems, the money that prisoners are allowed to spend is determined by their behaviour and rank on the Incentives and Earned Privileges (IEP) scheme ‚Äì a system employed in England and Wales. Within this national scheme, the maximum a prisoner can spend per week is ¬£25; however, most prisoners are limited to ¬£15.50. According to their custody level and individual spending limit, inmates may purchase hygiene products, candy, vitamins and supplements, clothing and desk lamps. Prisoners can purchase goods using canteen sheets that indicate the available products and attached pricing. Completed orders are sent to a courier service ‚Äì primarily DHL international couriers ‚Äìwhose staff ship the goods to the prison over the following week. In the U.S, money withdrawal requests are made by completing an ‚ÄòInmate Request‚Äô form, which allows inmates to spend money on television rentals, postage, magazine subscriptions, legal fees and charitable contributions. Prisoners can purchase clothes and other items not included on the canteen sheet ‚Äì for instance, DVDs and CDs from catalogues such as Amazon. Most prisons attach an administration fee to cover the associated processing and delivery costs of these external orders.  Different systems  United States = Work programs operate in 88% of prisons in the United States and employ approximately 775,000 prisoners. The vast majority of inmates are employed in support and maintenance roles, delivering mail, washing dishes and doing laundry. In the federal prison system, pay rates for these jobs range between US$0.12 to US$0.40 per hour. A smaller 4% of the U.S prison population work in ‚Äòcorrectional industries‚Äô, producing goods and services which are then sold externally to government agencies, Schools and non-profit organisations. U.S states have their own correctional programs, while the federal system operates in partnership with the UNICOR initiative. Across the U.S, receipt of wage payment and the amount of this payment differs. In most cases, the state and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) provide compensation for working prisoners; however, some states (e.g. Texas) do not pay prisoners for labour and others (e.g. Florida) generally only pay inmates involved in industry jobs. A relatively low number of incarcerated individuals work for private businesses, with only 6% of state and 16% of federal prisoners working in association with private companies as opposed to approximately 2,220,300 prisoners who work in prison maintenance. Wages earned by inmates in the U.S are credited to their electronic bank accounts bi-weekly. Court-ordered or statutorily mandated deductions such as filing fees, child support, transition and restriction fees may be derived from these bi-weekly wage payments. Triggered by the Prison Industry Enhancement Act in 1979, a wave of U.S legislation re-authorised paid prison labour. It dictated that prisoners in all 50 states must work during their incarceration. The private use of inmate labour remains prohibited in various international conventions, for instance, the ILO 1930 Convention Against Forced Labour. However, private use is permissible in the U.S through federal and state laws, which are grounded in the 13th Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery except as a punishment for a crime. = United Kingdom = Inmate Training and Work in Wakefield Prison, Britain, 1994 Prison systems within the United Kingdom require ‚Äòpurposeful activity‚Äô of all inmates who are mentally and physically capable. Not necessarily paid labour, this activity consists of education and training, commercial Workshops and service tasks such as cleaning or mentoring. Under the national system, a limited group of prisoners are entitled to be released on Temporary licences and employed by external organisations. For inmates who fail to participate in purposeful activity, retirement pay is available for prisoners over the national retirement age and a base unemployment amount of ¬£2.50 (minimum per week) is paid to those who are unable to work. The 1964 Prison Service Guidelines declare that individuals may receive financial compensation for the purposeful activity they perform while incarcerated. The current minimum rate of pay in the United Kingdom was issued in 2002 and is set in Prison Service Order 4460 ‚Äì it mandates that inmates involved in a type of work program must earn a minimum weekly wage of ¬£4. Unconvicted prisoners (those yet to be found innocent or guilty) who are involved in work programs are paid a wage equal to that of convicted prisoners, while those who choose not to work are supplied a base unemployment rate. In the United Kingdom, the average working prisoner earns about ¬£10 per week. The U.K National Product List (NPL) consists of roughly 1,000 products, featuring a variety of products such as fresh fruit and tinned produce to tobacco, stamps and Greeting cards. Purchased in bulk by DHL, public prisons select and order 375 items from the NPL to form a Local Product List (LPL). Supermarket branded products are generally cheaper than those on the NPL and some products are often not available on a particular prison's LPL. = Australia = Within the Australian penal system, all convicted individuals are required to participate in paid labour as a necessary procedure for inmate development and effective correctional management. Although not expected to work, unconvicted inmates are encouraged to involve themselves in programs tailored to self-development. The Australian system provides uniform wages across all federal prisons based on a five-day 30-hour working week. The ceiling wage per week is AU$70.2. It is provided in exchange for prisoner labour in the areas of general maintenance (construction, electrical and plumbing), domestic services (sweepers, sanitising), cooking services (for inmate meals) laundry or cleaning tasks. Prisoners who work extended hours due to deadlines or involvement in seven-day, 42-hour per week positions, may accrue earnings beyond AU$70.2. Wages are reviewed annually by the Director Operations Development branch of Australia's Corrective Services. The Australian system also offers community-based employment positions for inmates to participate in. For instance, as indigenous representatives, library clerks and tutors, as well as clerical support for industry managers and educational program coordinators. Incentives and rewards are routinely provided for prisoners who are involved in work and other programs aimed at self-development. = Europe = Across Eastern and Western Europe, paid prison labour is organised in different ways with different wage implications. Generally, European penal systems serve the goal of providing work as a positive and productive aspect of incarceration rather than punishment. European prison regimes allow inmates to work for both private companies and the prison administration, although this availability is determined by each particular country's mandate and workplace options. The availability of paid work in Europe is increasingly low. For instance, approximately only 5,300 labour roles are offered to 12,500 prisoners in Greece, while in Italy there is only one inmate out of five who is entitled to paid work. In France, approximately 17,800 inmates perform paid labour while incarcerated. Half of these prisoners are involved in prison administration work or programs supporting private firms for privatised prisons. In addition to basic maintenance and meal distribution jobs, prisoners also have the opportunity to carry out simple and repetitive production jobs in workshops or their cells. The availability of what tasks inmates can perform and where they may do so is often dependent on the inmate's security and privileges status. Prisoners in France who work the equivalent to a full-time employee generally earn an average of ‚Ç¨330 per month. This earning is then heavily levied between 20‚Äì25% for victim compensation. The remaining amount is levied further by 10% to be placed in a separate bank account only available to the inmate on their release date. A similar system of deductions is implemented across various European countries, including Portugal and Spain. Prison institutions in Portugal and Spain host the opportunity for vocational training programs, although, in Portugal, turnover rates in these programs are high. Prisons in Poland and Latvia incorporate unpaid work into their regimes, where volunteer and mandated work in the kitchen or maintenance areas are commonplace. As opposed to financial compensation, prisons in Greece often reduce prisoners‚Äô sentence length in exchange for their labour. = Japan = Assigned labour is considered a priority in Japan's correctional system. By law, if a prisoner refuses work or neglects their labour responsibility, punishment is to be implemented. Work hours consist of eight hours each day over the Monday-Friday period and four hours on Saturdays ‚Äì although individual cases may extend or limit these procedures. In most prisons, inmates who perform paid work are paid for their activity. This is calculated per the individual's standard hourly wage based on their assigned labour level. There are ten levels in Japan's penal labour system, ranging from class ten (trainee) to class one (the highest level of promotion). New workers begin at the trainee level and move up the ranks based on the prison's routinised ability examinations which assess inmates‚Äô effort and attitude levels, and the quality and quantity of produced goods. Prisoners who are involved in work programs external to the prison or those who work outside of the typical labour schedule receive increased compensation. This is also the case for inmates who perform ‚Äòdangerous labour.‚Äô The money earned by inmates through prison labour in Japan is not ‚Äòowned‚Äô by the inmate until they are released from incarceration. Instead, income is placed into a specialised bank account with only a small amount being available for prisoner use to purchase essential items from the prison store. Permission may also be granted for inmates to use this saved amount toward fines, lawsuit fees and alimony. Depending on an inmate's classification, occupational training is also a feature of Japan's correctional system. Intended to prepare prisoners for their release into society, prison institutions may offer training in dry cleaning, automobile repairs, photo typography, carpentry and leatherwork. These opportunities are based on prisoner requests and may or may not be accepted by prison authorities. Prisoners in Japan are also able to undertake factory work (i.e. assembling machinery, fabricating parts) for external manufacturers through contracted arrangements. As opposed to outsourcing labour to China-based factories, manufacturers subcontract their factory work to prisons to save shipping and production costs.  Institution types  Private prisons = A large part of paid prison labour is controlled by private prisons designed as for-profit organisations that manage correctional facilities on both the state and federal levels. These prisons are organised contractually to oversee pre-existing public facilities or through managing private facilities independently. The privatisation of prisons became increasingly popular in the 21st century. In most cases, Governments contract companies to build and manage prison facilities to pay the company per prisoner/per day. Wages are characteristically lower than minimum wage in private prisons, with some inmates earning less than US$1 per hour for their work. Portions of prisoner wages may also be withheld by the state to compensate for incarceration costs. Regulations in private prisons are minimal, limiting inmate access to sick leave and holidays, while also potentially endangering workers due to the lack of federal oversight in the area of workplace safety. In various private prisons, inmates who refuse to perform their allocated work may be a subject to a loss of privileges as punishment. In the United States, about 10% of prisoners are held in private prisons or facilities which are independently contracted by the federal and state governments. A considerable 75% these private prisons operate under the authority of two corporations: the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and the GEO Group. Alongside the increase of prisoners in privatised prisons, CCA and GEO Group experienced associated profit growth with their annual revenues surpassing US$2.9 billion in 2010. Education programs available alongside paid work in minimum-security facilities U.S inmates incarcerated in private facilities are given the opportunity for paid work in association with companies such as Revlon, Target and Microsoft. American Corporations who employ prison labourers may benefit by using the tag ‚Äòmade in the USA‚Äô and reduced transportation fees accumulated through shipping externally manufactured products back to the US to package and sell. = Minimum, medium, and high security = Paid prison labour is experienced differently based on the security type of prison facilities ‚Äì whether this is minimum, medium, or [maximum security. Reserved for low-risk or non-violent offenders, minimum- security prisons are of a similar layout to college campuses, where inmates are entitled to greater privileges (e.g. freedom to roam the prison grounds) and there is high participation in paid labour. Inmates incarcerated in minimum-security prisoners are those with cleaner criminal records (thieves, frauds etc.) or inmates who have already served the majority of their sentence in a different facility with sustained good behaviour. In most countries, minimum-security facilities incorporate dormitory-style living quarters and fewer guards than higher security prisons. Medium-security prisons are the most common type of facility and typically house the majority of criminals. These facilities are surrounded by razor-wire fences and feature cage-style housing and increased guard activity. Inmates in medium-security prisons experience a more regimented routine that those incarcerated in minimum- security prisons. Paid work is less prominent as Regulations limit the types of paid work available, for instance, removing the opportunity for inmates to seek external employment or training. Maximum-security prisons incarcerate the most high-risk and dangerous offenders. Prisoners in these facilities are overseen by numerous guards and experience minimal freedoms and privileges. This includes paid work, with most high-security inmates having no option to participate in paid employment while serving their sentence. Maximum-security prisons are surrounded by high walls, barbed tape and armed guards posted in Observation towers. Total lockdowns are routine in maximum-security prisons, occurring when incidents take place and prisoners are confined to their private cells for several days. Some maximum-security prisons ‚Äì known as Supermax prisons ‚Äì operate under permanent lockdown, although most prisons feature a Supermax ward known as a ‚Äòsecurity housing unit.‚Äô Prisoners refer to this facility as ‚Äòthe hole.'

The riots led to the death of 4 people with an additional 17 people being injured. Events prior to the massacreLetter of demand= In December 1942 labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate were dissatisfied with the low wages being paid by the estate owners, the Harel and Rousset clans. Four of these workers (Andr√©e Moonsamy, Hurrynanan Boykount, Sirkisson Seenath and Kistnasamy Mooneesamy) wrote and signed a letter on behalf of all the estate's workers and sent it to the Director of Labour Department to ask for fairer compensation. =Strike of 14 days= As there was no response to their letter labourers at Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate started to strike on 13 September 1943 in protest. They nominated Hurryparsad Ramnarain and Sharma Jugdambee to represent their interests on the Conciliation Board. In those days the interests of owners and growers of sugar cane were represented by the Labour Department and it was common practice for such conflicts to be resolved via the Conciliation Board meetings. On 17 September 1943 at a meeting of the Conciliation Board the Labour Department proposed an agreement to the 2 representatives Ramnarain and Jugdambee. Unfortunately these representatives failed to consult with the striking workers. A conflict of interest was also at play given that Ramnarain worked as a propagandist within the Department of Information which was headed by the Acting Director of Labour who also happened to be Chairman of the Conciliation Board. As a result the labourers of Belle Vue Harel rejected the new agreement and refused to resume work. They demanded the appointment of a new Conciliation Board and a fairer agreement. Seven days later on 24 September 1943 the owners of the sugar estate threatened workers who did not abide by his agreement to leave his sugar estate within 5 days. As the deadline of 29 September approached the owners and Labour Department had made arrangements with the local police to put an end to the strike. =Police intervention= On 27 September 1943 the workers organised a sit-in within the premises of the sugar estate. Police Constable Thancanamootoo disguised as a labourer was sent to the meeting to check on the striking labourers. However his cover was blown and the workers assaulted him. He fled to the estate manager's office and waited for his boss to arrive. Deputy Commissioner of Police Allan Bell and Assistant Superintendent of Police Fondaumi√®re eventually arrived with several armed policemen. They decided to proceed to the arrest of PC Thancanamootoo's aggressor but encountered a crowd of between 200 and 300 men, women, and children armed with sticks and stones. They surrounded and outnumbered the police and refused to give up their sticks and stones. Martyrs In an attempt to disperse the crowd police fired 16 shots and even a tear gas grenade at the crowd, resulting in 3 deaths, 5 labourers with bullet wounds and 12 others with slight injuries. Nine days later on 6 October 1943 a fourth labourer (Marday Panapen) died at the Civil Hospital in Port Louis, as a result of his bullet wounds. The three dead labourers were Soondrum Pavatdan (better known as Anjalay Coopen the 32 year old pregnant woman), Kistnasamy Mooneesamy (37 year old labourer), and Moonsamy Moonien (14 year old boy). Legacy Basdeo Bissoondoyal the social worker and founder of the Jan Andolan movement organised the funeral ceremony of the four victims of the police shootings and it was attended by more than 1500 individuals. The 1943 Belle Vue Harel Massacre took place 6 years after the Uba riots of 1937 in the same part of the world. Although the root causes are not the same they highlight the struggles and vulnerability of the Indo-Mauritian labourers and planters whose ancestors migrated to Mauritius under the British colonial rule. On 1 October 1943 a Commission of Enquiry was instigated and the Commissioners consisted of S. Moody, Dr. Eug√®ne Laurent, Hon A. M. Osman, Mr the Justice G. Espitalier-Noel and His Honour Mr Rampersad Neerunjun. The Moody Commission of Enquiry report (published in 1944) reiterated several findings of the Hooper Commission which had followed the earlier 1937 UBA riots. Moreover they were very critical of the Police and of the Labour Department's failure to resolve this matter peacefully. The martyrs of the 1943 massacre at Belle Vue Harel were commemorated by Mauritian singer Siven Chinien in his song L'ann√©e 1943 which was released in his 1970s album Ratsitatane, Conscience Noire. The Government of Mauritius has acknowledged the historical importance of the massacre. Between 1995 and 2007 monuments and statues of Anjalay Coopen have been erected in the capital city Port Louis as well as in the village of Cottage. The Anjalay Stadium was also named after one of the four martyrs Anjalay.

Coloured lithograph after L.-L. Boilly. Sensory history is an area of academic study which examines the role the five senses have played in the past. It developed partly as a reaction to the lack of serious attention given to sensory experience in traditional history books, which often treat sensory experience as a writing technique rather than a serious avenue of enquiry. Works of sensory history try to convey a deeper understanding of the past through an emphasis on physical experiences. One of the most significant proponents of sensory history is the American historian Mark M. Smith. Anthropological approaches to sensory studies have had a notable influence on sensory history and there has been significant discussion and overlap between the two disciplines. The transient nature of sensory experience makes sensory history a difficult topic to study and write about. This challenge is reflected in debate within the field, such as what methods of presentation are appropriate for works of sensory history.  History  Karl Marx drew attention to the possibility of sensory history in The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, in which he stated that \\"the forming of the five senses is a labour of the entire history of the world down to the present.\\" In 1942 Lucien Febvre, a French historian and one of the founders of the Annales School, called for the history of sensibilities to be examined and so is credited as one of the first historians to consider the senses as a legitimate historical field of study. The development of sensory history has also been influenced by other academic disciplines, such as philosophy and anthropology. The idea that sight is the most important sense of the modern era was particularly argued by philosopher Michel Foucault. Philosophers Marshall McLuhan and Walter J. Ong expanded on this idea in their theory of 'the great divide'. The theory claims that the invention of the printing press caused a fundamental shift in how people used their senses ‚Äì from hearing being the most important sense, to sight. The concept of the pre-eminence of sight in the modern world, has also prompted a particular focus on the other four senses in works of sensory history in order to readdress this inequality. Anthropologists such as David Howes and Constance Classen have also made significant contributions to the study of sensory history, particularly in regards to the importance of context in sensory histories, through their work within the broader field of sensory studies. Historian Alain Corbin produced one of the first books focussing exclusively on sensory history in 1982, The Foul and the Fragrant: Odor and the French Social Imagination, a discussion on the role of smell in 18th and 19th century France. In 1994 George H. Roeder wrote the essay Coming to Our Senses, which claimed that historical studies were still lacking in engagement with the senses, particularly history textbooks. The historian who has most represented sensory history in the 21st century is Mark M. Smith, who has written both a book on the subject of sensory history itself and books which examine historical events through the senses.  Method  Sensory history is often written because of a significant lack of any examination of the sensory in a particular historical area previously. This means that sensory historians can simply re-examine primary and secondary sources, with a lens for the sensory, in order to support their work. Historian Mark M. Smith refers to sensory history as a 'habit' that can be used across many fields of historical study. Historicising the senses is an important concept for sensory historians when conducting research, and this means considering the senses in their historical context while putting aside more modern conceptions of the senses. This concept lies at the heart of many sensory histories because if accounts of sensory experience cannot be taken at face-value then a more rigorous examination is required. The idea of historicising the senses is significantly influenced by sensory anthropological studies. Sensory history is a field which lends itself to inter-disciplinary cooperation with fields such as anthropology and media studies. Because sensory history concerns itself with the sensory experiences of individuals, it is linked to the notion of 'bottom up' history, which focusses on the lives of ordinary people throughout history. = Inter-sensoriality = Inter-sensoriality (also spelt intersensoriality) is a word used by sensory historians to describe one of the goals of sensory history, which is to consider the five senses together and how they work in concert. Works of history which consider the whole inter- sensoriality of a subject aim to provide a more complete and engaging perspective on history.  Challenges  The question of how to present sensory history is a significant challenge. Sensory experience is in nature transient, so historians must consider how best to represent and discuss this. A further challenge for sensory historians when conducting sensory history is how to access sensory experiences of the past. Written descriptions of sensory experiences are numerous and often used, but some historians take this further and attempt to recreate past sensory experiences, in the hope that by experiencing it themselves they can better understand the past. In regards to this dilemma, historian Alain Corbin states that the historian is always a \\"prisoner of language\\" when investigating the past.  Debate  The method of presentation of sensory history has been a significant topic of debate in the field of sensory history. Historians such as Peter Charles Hoffer place priority upon the communication of their work to their audience. This can involve more creative methods of presentation, such as living museums or interactive exhibitions, in order for the audience to more deeply experience and understand the past. Other historians, such as Mark M. Smith, disagree with this method of presentation, as priority is placed upon the historicity of the senses. Smith contends that how people sense now is fundamentally different from how people sensed in the past, based on factors such as location and context. He argues that presentations of sensory history such as living museums undermine the integrity of sensory history, as they suggest that a person is able to experience the past in the same way that those who lived the experience did, regardless of their fundamentally different contexts and places unnecessary importance on the 'consumption' of the past. Another significant debate in relation to sensory history is the relevance of the 'great divide' theory, as presented in The Gutenberg Galaxy by Marshall McLuhan, to the study of sensory history. Sensory historians give varying degrees of importance to this theory.  The senses  Touch = Touch has historically been included as one of the 'lower' senses, that is, not requiring any skill of the mind to be used. German naturalist Lorenz Oken characterised Africans as the uncivilised \\"skin-man,\\" as opposed to the civilised European \\"eye-man,\\" thus utilising touch to support racist ideology. As a result of this view of touch as a 'lower' and 'uncivilised' sense, serious historical analysis of the role touch has played in the past was lacking until the end of the 20th century, when interest in sensory history first 'boomed'. Histories of touch naturally lend themselves to a history of sexuality, but touch is also central to histories of Christian practices. For example, in renaissance and early modern England debates ranged from the role of the kiss in Christian practices to the legitimacy of the 'royal touch', which was reputed to heal the sick. Additionally, the sense of touch is such an integral part of everyday life and experience that it is not often referred to explicitly in historical sources, and so is an \\"inferred history\\" as named by historian Constance Classen. = Hearing = One of the first sensory histories dealing with the sense of hearing is Village Bells: Sound and Meaning in the Nineteenth-century French Countryside by Alain Corbin, which examines the meanings embedded in the sound of bells in 19th century French villages. The study of cities, particularly with regards to industrialisation, is a common topic of histories of sound or hearing. For example, the term 'soundscape' often refers to both the sounds of the physical environment inhabited, and how these sounds are perceived, especially in regard to how the soundscapes of certain cities change, and how this change affects its citizens. This necessarily draws upon inter-disciplinary research in the fields of soundscapes, sound studies and urban history. The historian Mark M. Smith has suggested the term \\"acoustemology\\" as a title for this field of study. Of particular importance in this topic is the invention of recording methods, which provided a pivotal turning point in the history of the sense of hearing and radically changed society's relationship with the sense of hearing. Additionally, how people's relative perception and sensitivity to sound has changed is of particular interest. = Smell = Perfumer Eug√®ne Rimmel stated in the 19th century that \\"the history of perfume is, in some manner, that of civilisation.\\" Rarely has the sense of smell been given any prominence in the study of history, which partly stems from the difficulty the English language poses in describing olfactory sensations. Aristotle first pointed this out in De Anima, and it is continually seen in the reliance upon words related to flavour when describing smells. A more common description of smells is simply distinguishing whether the smell is pleasurable or not. Smell is historically considered one of the ‚Äòlower‚Äô senses (like touch and taste) as it is linked to animals who often have a keener sense of smell than humans. The sense of smell is also generally considered to be an undervalued sense, particularly in Western societies. This perspective also stems somewhat from the philosopher Immanual Kant who stated that it was the \\"least rewarding\\" and \\"most easily dispensable sense.\\" In Alain Corbin's book The Foul and the Fragrant, he argues that the sense of smell is inherently tied to social power, as historically certain groups of people have been rendered as 'lesser' because of lack of hygiene. = Taste = The history of taste is traditionally tied to food history and food studies, however sensory histories of taste attempt to analyse this sense throughout history more broadly and to expand beyond gastronomy. As the sense of taste is intrinsically connected to the act of eating, so the history of taste is necessarily tied to morality and the sin of gluttony, and also therefore the history of the Christian church. Taste is historically considered a lower sense, particularly as it requires physical contact with the subject of the tasting. = Sight = Sight has historically been considered one of the 'higher' senses as it is linked to reading and use of the mind. It has also been associated with the higher classes of society whose jobs do not involve manual labour, as opposed to the lower classes who have even been referred to as simply \\"hands\\". This is also reflected in the use of the term 'Dark Ages' and the 'Enlightenment' to describe the period of history in which minimal progress was made as opposed to the period when the foundations of modern thought were built. Due to this supposed supremacy, particularly within the sensory hierarchy of the west, there is no dearth of visual analysis in the practice of traditional history writing. Visual sources such as photographs and paintings are frequently utilised as important sources in historical works. In his essay, When Seeing Makes Scents, Mark M. Smith argues that these visual sources can be mined for information about the other four senses in order to gain a more complete understanding of past sensory experiences.  Significant works  In the ‚Äòboom‚Äô of sensory history during the late 20th and early 21st century, many significant works have been produced within the field of sensory history. Historian Mark M. Smith has written the introductory book Sensory History and a sensory history of the American Civil War in The Smell of Battle and the Taste of Siege. A series of books titled The Cultural History of the Senses surveys the role the five senses has played from antiquity to the modern age through a variety of essays on the subject. Additionally in Empire of the Senses: a Cultural Reader, David Howes has selected essays which represent a large cross-section of the field.
