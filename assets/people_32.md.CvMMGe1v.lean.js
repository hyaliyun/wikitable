The word outlaw carries a specific meaning which does mean criminal intent. Such clubs/gangs are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) and does not adhere to the AMA's rules. The club originally had six members, there is a misconception that the word \\"disciples\\" was intentionally misspelled to distance themselves from any type of religion. However, in the early days of the club, some founding members went to Mexico to have their patches made, and the misspelling was unintentional, but stuck. Their insignia is a motorcycle wheel with two tridents crossing over it. In the United States, the club has chapters in Alabama, Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, and Ohio. Controversies In November 2006, the U.S. District Court in Detroit closed its first major methamphetamine case with the sentencing of two Devils Diciples members and five associates in connection to manufacturing methamphetamine. In an investigation into the club begun in 2002, prosecutors in 2009 requested dropping the last remaining charges against the club's national president, Jeff \\"Fat Dog\\" Garvin Smith, \\"...to avoid compromising an ongoing investigation and because the interests of justice require it.\\" Charges against 17 other club members or associates had been dropped in April. These charges included drug trafficking and other offenses, brought when 18 alleged members of the Devils Diciples were arrested on April 2, 2009 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During the raid, 42 firearms, 3,000 rounds of ammunition, three bullet-proof vests, $12,000, 15 casino-style slot machines, 1,000 Vicodin and OxyContin pills, 1¬Ω pounds of methamphetamine and 55 pounds of marijuana were seized. The remaining charges Smith was to be tried for were being \\"...a violent felon in possession of body armor...\\" as well as \\"...using a communications facility (a telephone) in furtherance of drug trafficking...\\" New Baltimore, Michigan District Court Judge Paul Cassidy was investigated in April 2009 for allegedly giving Devils Diciples members preferential treatment. He is a boyhood friend of their National President Jeff Garvin Smith. Cassidy announced his retirement after his home and office were searched as part of the investigation of the Devils Diciples. In 2011, Stephen J. Kinzey, a kinesiology professor at California State University, San Bernardino, was accused of smuggling methamphetamine while part of the club. Per San Bernardino Superior Court records, Kinzey's charges have been dismissed. Duane \\"Dog\\" Chapman, now an anti-crime celebrity bounty hunter, was associated with the club during his adolescence. July 2012, 31 Devils Diciples members in Michigan and Alabama were arrested by the FBI. More than 60 firearms and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition were seized during this investigation. In addition, eight methamphetamine manufacturing laboratories were dismantled. Smith and five other members were convicted in Federal court in 2015 of various offenses. As of July 2015, sentencing had been delayed until 2016.

The noise is supplied by a sound generator, which may reside in or above the ear or be placed on a table or elsewhere in the environment. The noise is usually white noise or music, but in some cases, it may be patterned sound or specially tailored sound based on the characteristics of the person's tinnitus. The perceived loudness of tinnitus, called sensation level (SL), is how much louder the tinnitus is above the ambient noise of the environment. By raising the ambient level of noise (playing white noise into the ear), the apparent loudness of tinnitus is reduced. The noise level is close to and usually somewhat louder than the perceived loudness of the tinnitus. The generated noise is designed to be a calming, less intrusive sound than the ringing or hissing of tinnitus. Depending on the loudness of the noise, tinnitus may be fully or partially masked. Tinnitus masking cannot reduce or eliminate tinnitus, only reduce awareness of it. The efficacy of a tinnitus masker may depend on the wearer's capacity to experience residual inhibition, the temporary suppression of tinnitus in response to particular sound patterns. The mechanism of sound masking can be explained by analogy with light. In a dark room where someone is turning a lamp on and off, the light will be obviously noticeable. However, if the overhead lights are turned on, turning on the lamp will no longer be as distracting because it has been \\"masked\\". While sound masking is an effective solution for a majority of those with tinnitus, it does not work for everyone. History The concept that an external sound could suppress perception of an internal one was first realised clinically in the mid 1970s by Dr. Jack Vernon, when he reported that white noise was effective in alleviating tinnitus.Vernon J. (1976) \\"The use of masking for relief of tinnitus\\". In: Silverstein H, Norrell H, eds. Neurological Surgery of the Ear: Volume II. Birmingham: Aesculapius Publishing, 104‚Äì118 Suppression vs. masking Tinnitus suppression is different than but related to tinnitus masking. It is an acoustic or neurological effect that results in temporary suppression of tinnitus by listening to an appropriately tailored sound for a short period. After the sound is withdrawn, tinnitus may be fully (complete silence) or partially suppressed. Most (70‚Äì90%) of persons can experience the effect. There is usually a period of complete silence followed by a gradual return of tinnitus to its original level. The effect lasts for 5 minutes or less in 90% of persons but in rare cases, an hour or more. The period of complete silence is usually seconds to about a minute. If the trigger sound is repeated at intervals, tinnitus can be suppressed as long as the repetition lasts. =Residual inhibition= The residual inhibition (RI) effect, first noted in 1903, is the capacity of a sound of the right frequency and intensity to briefly attenuate or suppress tinnitus. To distinguish the tailored sound used for inhibition from the broadband undifferentiated sound employed in tinnitus maskers, it is usually referred to as the 'trigger' or 'quieting' sound. The trigger sound is closely matched to the pitch and spectrum of the tinnitus, and as loud or somewhat louder than the perceived loudness of the tinnitus. The trigger sound is applied to the ear or ears with tinnitus and typically lasts a minute or two. Not everyone can experience RI; for those who do not, tinnitus masking is likely to be ineffective. Acoustic qualities Two qualities of a tinnitus masker need to be taken into account: how effective the masking is, and how intrusive or distracting the generated sound itself is. The masking sound may have various temporal, spectral and amplitudinal characteristics. In some cases, the sound is tuned to the pitch, loudness and other qualities of the tinnitus. However, frequencies widely divergent from the tinnitus frequency may also mask the tinnitus, if they are of sufficient loudness. The minimum energy (or loudness) mask is usually one closely matched to the central frequency and bandwidth of the tinnitus. But it has also been discovered that a tinnitus mask close to the frequency of the tinnitus can be ineffective, while a masker with a different frequency or bandwidth effectively masks the tinnitus. This indicates different origins of tinnitus. Tinnitus maskers may use music or natural sounds, wide band white or pink noise, narrow band white noise, a notched soundfield, frequency or amplitude modulated sound, intermittent pulsed sound, or other patterned sound. Temporally patterned sound may be more effective than white noise or background music in masking tinnitus. Studies have found that bandpass maskers are less annoying than pure tone maskers, that the annoyance rating of bandpass maskers is proportional to bandwidth, that intermittent maskers were more annoying than continuous ones, and that control over the center frequency and bandwidth was important in minimizing the annoyance of maskers. =Limitations= In addition to the spectrum of masking sound, the amplitude determines the degree of masking achieved. In some cases, the required masking amplitude is so high as to cause discomfort to the user of the sound generator, and the tinnitus is therefore considered unmaskable. The frequency and other characteristics of tinnitus can vary over time, and the shifts can be temporary or permanent. They may also be cyclical. Therefore, the optimal tinnitus mask may need to be adjusted periodically, within days, hours, or even minutes. So a fixed recording (i.e. CD, DVD or audio file) of a tinnitus mask is not a very efficacious application. There are also safety issues associated with use of tinnitus maskers: the \\"safe\\" level of continuous sound depends on the duration of the sound. For maskers worn continuously, or most of the day, a safe level is no more than 70 dB, in accordance with EPA maximum safe exposure level for 24-hour environmental sound. Maskers louder than 45 dB or so (the ambient background level of an average home living area) may start to interfere with understanding conversation (about 60 dB). Masking of high frequency tinnitus (>6,000 Hz) is difficult because of the resonance characteristics of the human ear as well as high frequency limitations of in- ear devices. The ear has a resonance frequency (highest frequency response) at 3,000 Hz and rolls off at a very steep 26 dB/octave on the high frequency side. Unfortunately, most tinnitus is associated with hearing loss, and most hearing loss and tinnitus is high frequency. Most maskers are limited to about 6,000 Hz of effective output. Higher frequency output results in increasing distortion, and may cause rejection of the device. =Minimum masking level= The minimum masking level (MML) is the minimum amplitude of narrowband noise centered on the tinnitus pitch (or frequency range) necessary to completely mask the tinnitus. Devices Tinnitus maskers are commonly used by tinnitus sufferers when trying to sleep or relax, as it is within these quiet environments that the tinnitus is at its most noticeable. They commonly take the form of CD or MP3 recordings, or bedside noise generators. When used in conjunction with a sound pillow (which contains small embedded speakers) they can mask a person's tinnitus sounds without disturbing his/her partner. These masker devices use soothing natural sounds such as ocean surf, rainfall or synthetic sounds such as white noise, pink noise, or brown noise to help the auditory system become less sensitive to tinnitus and promote relaxation by reducing the contrast between tinnitus sounds and background sound. More advanced software based tinnitus maskers can use a combination of natural and synthetic sounds or a filtered noise generator tailored to mask the specific frequencies at which the tinnitus signal is experienced. Some sufferers require masking at all times. These people may employ wearable hearing aids which amplify ambient sound, generate low level wide band sounds such as white noise, or combination devices that mix both functions into one device. A standard hearing aid may be used for tinnitus masking; the tuning and amplification characteristics are different than when one is used in compensation for hearing loss. A study by Jalilvand in 2015, showed that hearing aids instead of tinnitus maskers used to amplify sounds helped with the perception of tinnitus for veterans with blast-induced tinnitus.Jalilvand, H., Pourbakht, A., & Haghani, H. (2015). Hearing aid or tinnitus masker: which one is the best treatment for blast-induced tinnitus? The results of a long- term study on 974 patients. Audiology & Neuro-Otology, 20(3), 195‚Äì201 Sound generators (masking devices) have received Class II approval from the FDA. However, they are considered to be \\"experimental, investigational, or unproven\\" therapies. =Vibration maskers= There is one report of a bone conduction vibration masker that transmits a 60 Hz fundamental with adjustable harmonics up to 1000 Hz. A commercial device based on the phenomenon (Aurex3) was approved by the FDA. =High frequency audio and ultrasonic bone conduction maskers= A new development in tinnitus management is the use of high audio (10‚Äì20 kHz) or ultrasonic (20‚Äì100 kHz) via bone conduction. Efficacy A 2012 Cochrane Review stated the available studies do not show strong evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy including tinnitus maskers in tinnitus management. Clinical practice Audiologic Tinnitus Management (ATM) is a clinical protocol for management of tinnitus involving counselling and sound therapy including tinnitus maskers. Research Neural Plasticity and Cortical Remapping tinnitus is associated with cortical reorganization after hearing loss.

Mead was a prolific artist who worked in various fields - landscapes, street scenes, still lifes and flower studies alongside her portrait work, using both oil on canvas and watercolour on paper. Early life Mead was born in Bury St Edmunds, the daughter of a plumber, glazier and house painter. She was aged 20 before she had any formal artistic training when she attended the Lincoln School of Art. She left there to study at the Westminster School of Art, in London in 1892, under the tutorship of Frederick Brown just prior to his appointment as Professor at the Slade School of Fine Art. During this time she painted a self-portrait in the act of cooking. A company that made cookers similar to the one pictured offered ¬£500.00 (¬£ as of ) to add their name, an amount she refused because she was unwilling to \\"prostitute\\" her art. Mead's stay at Westminster was brief before having to return home to nurse her father. After his death Mead studied under Auguste- Joseph D√©l√©cluse in Paris, where a pastel portrait was exhibited at the Paris Salon. This same portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1896. Later life The house where artist Rose Mead lived, located in Bury St Edmunds, England. Mead returned to Bury St Edmunds in 1897, never- except for the rare holiday- to leave again. In the same year Cuisine en Boheme was shown at the Royal Academy summer exhibition. Two paintings Friday Morning at St Mary's and My Mother were shown in the 1899 exhibition. Rose Mead nursed her mother until her death in 1919, whilst earning a living painting portraits, mainly commissioned by local dignitaries. In 1929 she visited Newlyn in Cornwall, visiting the existing Newlyn School of artists of that time. One figure study titled Painted in Dod Procter's studio in Newlyn is a known result of the visit. In c. 1933 she visited the South of France, a watercolour of St Paul de Vence provides a record of that time. The artist was known by locals to approach girls and young women if she was attracted by some characteristic, and would ask if, with their parents permission, they would be happy to pose for her. Whilst painting she counselled them not to get married, urging them to find fulfilment in a career, one sitter remembering that once the artist had discovered she had married - \\"She felt that I had quite changed and that it had a detrimental effect on my personality\\". The artist never achieved the promise shown at the start of her career, it is thought mainly because of the breaks caused by the death of her father and the need to care for her mother until she was aged 52. She was found dead at the bottom of her studio stairs in Crown Street, Bury St Edmunds at the end of March 1946 at the age of 78.

MINIMOP provided an on-line, time- sharing environment (Multiple Online Programming, or MOP in ICL terminology), and typically ran alongside George 2 running batch jobs. MINIMOP was named to reflect its role as an alternative to the MOP facilities of George 3, which required a more powerful machine. MINIMOP would run on all 1900 processors apart from the low-end 1901 and 1902 and required only 16K words of memory and two 4 or 8 million character magnetic disks. Each user was provided with a fixed size file to hold his data, which was subdivided into a number of variable sized subfiles. The command language could be extended with simple macros.  Implementation  MINIMOP was implemented as a multithreaded (sub- programmed in ICL terminology) user level program running on the standard executive (low level operating system) of the ICL 1900. The program under control facilities of executive were used to run user programs under MINIMOP. All user I/O operations were trapped by MINIMOP and emulated rather than accessing real peripherals. As memory was at a premium user programs would be swapped out of memory whenever they needed to wait (for input or output) or when they reached the end of their time slice.

The 12‚Äì6 curveball is one of the types of pitches thrown in baseball. It is categorized as a breaking ball because of its downward break. The 12‚Äì6 curveball, unlike the normal curveball (also referred to as the \\"11 to 5 curve\\" or a \\"2 to 8 curve\\" for its motion), breaks in a downward motion in a straight line. This explains the name \\"12‚Äì6\\", because the break of the pitch refers to the ball breaking from the number 12 to the number 6 on a clock. While the 11‚Äì5 and 2‚Äì8 variations are very effective pitches, they are less effective than a true 12‚Äì6, because the ball will break into the heart of the bat more readily. The pitch is used throughout Major League Baseball. It has several nicknames, including the \\"yellow hammer\\".Paul Dickson, Skip McAfee, The Dickson Baseball Dictionary (Third Edition) (2011), p. 953.  Movement  The 12 to 6 curveball is the toughest type of curveball to hit, because it moves vertically, and has no horizontal break. The difference of the speed from a fastball and the break make the pitch difficult to hit if a pitcher uses it correctly in a pitching sequence.Gola, Mark; Myers, Doug (2000), p.115 The 12 to 6 curveball is usually pitched from the overhand motion, as a three- quarters or sidearm delivery would cause the ball to break 2 to 8 instead of 12 to 6. The sharp vertical break on the 12‚Äì6 curveball is created when pitchers apply topspin to the ball with their fingers in the process of releasing it.  Effectiveness  Depending on the situation and the type of pitcher, the 12‚Äì6 curveball may be more or less effective. Against a batter with the same handedness as the pitcher, the 12 to 6 curveball has been proven to be a very effective pitch in general, but the pitch is much easier to hit if the batter is the opposite handedness of the pitcher, making an 11 to 5 curveball the more effective pitch type in that situation. The effectiveness of the pitch also depends on the ability of the pitcher to apply topspin to the ball, creating movement. When stats for a high level pitcher's average 12 to 6 curveball are factored in, the 12 to 6 and the 11 to 5 are much more effective than Major League Baseball's average throwers of the pitch due to the pitcher's high level of ability for that pitch.  Throwing mechanics  The 12‚Äì6 curveball is thrown similarly to most curveballs. The pitch is generally thrown using a four-seam grip, in which the middle finger on the pitcher's throwing hand is placed in the gap between the two seams on the right side, and the index finger is placed directly next to it. The pitcher's thumb is placed directly on the bottom of the baseball. This grip allows the pitcher to create a high amount of topspin while still having a good control of the pitch. The pitch is then thrown with an exaggerated 12‚Äì6 motion with both the middle finger and the thumb simultaneously helping move the baseball towards home plate, while the pitcher's index finger giving the ball topspin. This extensive combination of mechanics makes this one of the most difficult pitches to master.Gola, Mark; Myers, Doug (2000), p.117 Notable practitioners *The 12‚Äì6 generally agreed upon as the most effective of all time belonged to Dodgers Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/585147-mlb-power-rankings-the- top-10-curveballs-in-baseball-history#slide10 *2002 Cy Young Award winner Barry Zito, formerly of the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants, threw a 12‚Äì6 curve that was, at one point, widely recognized as the best in baseball.Barry Zito‚Äôs Nasty Hook *Three time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers throws a 12‚Äì6 curve that was labelled by broadcaster Vin Scully as \\"Public Enemy #1.\\"https://dodgers.mlblogs.com/on- this-date-the-clayton-kershaw-era-begins-322361a2d543 Nolan Ryan, Major League Baseball‚Äôs all time leader in career strikeouts, also deployed a particularly nasty 12-6 curveball.

A reunion followed in 1990 only for the band to break up again in 1997. They reformed again in 2007 with a concert in the Kosmische Club, Camden, UK. Following this, sister band Harmonia reformed.

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) Reserve also had training areas on the airport in the 1950s. A two story brick building at the center of the airport held the base for the Marine Corps Reserve Training Center, which also utilized other buildings on the airport for various uses including a gymnasium, maintenance buildings, a weapons range, and locker rooms. =Jet Age= By the 1960s, the Connellsville airport had three paved runways, one of approximately 3,400 feet and the other two at 3,000 feet. Of those three, only two survive today. The middle runway was deactivated in the late 1960s. Today it is used as a taxiway and an area for driver training. Anchor Hocking ‚ÄòGlass Corporation‚Äô, a former major Fayette County employer, rented significant space on the airport, mostly warehouse type space, in the 1960s.

VVS has received on numerous occasions Federal funding for improvements to the facilities and runways specifically from the Aviation Development Program (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) after 2001. In 2005, the new terminal opened at a cost in excess of $2,000,000. In 2009, VVS received $1 million from Federal (Rural Community Assistance Partnership grant) Jewels Phraner, \\"Connellsville airport runway expansion project nears\\", June 5, 2009. and state sources to extend the main runway (runway safe zone projectGrant money to help fund Connellsville Airport runway safe zone, The Tribune-Review, March 24, 2009.). This extension, using allocation of Federal and state money, allows for larger aircraft to land at Connellsville Airport. KVVS also received grant money to improve general aviation hangar space in close proximity to the new terminal built in 2005. This money totaling $1 million from a Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) grant Rebekah Sungala, Airport authority opens bids for hangars, January 12, 2011 has to be spent on aviation hangar spaces and requires airport matching funds of approximately $800,000.

This included plans for the main terminal construction as well as extension of the runway which was substantially completed by late Fall in 2009. The extension was completed to appease insurance companies that refused to let larger planes land on the airfield. This extension stands to increase air traffic to and from the Connellsville Airport location in support of larger economic development efforts and tourism. This revitalization included construction of a new terminal building on the north ramp area at the site of the old Taylor Aircraft hangar from 1951.PennDoT Airport Properties Directory, Accessed August 12, 2011. The hangar was partially disassembled to reveal the steel superstructure, with the new terminal being built into the west side of the old hangar. The remainder of the steel Taylor Aircraft hangar remains as part of a covered parking lot. Completion of the multimillion-dollar terminal project occurred in 2005. Approximately $6 Million was used to upgrade the airport from 2002 to 2007.

The major organizations of this movement is the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA) in North America, and Women of the Wall (WOW) and its affiliates in Israel and internationally, known as The International Committee for Women of the Wall (ICWOW). In Israel, the leading Orthodox feminist organization is Kolech, started by Dr. Hannah Kehat. Australia has one Orthodox partnership minyan, Shira Hadasha, in Melbourne. The movement relies on liberal interpretations of Jewish Law, by both modern and classical rabbinic scholars, taking advantage of the lack of universal consensus on legal interpretations amongst rabbis in different eras. In 2016, Lila Kagedan officially became the first female Orthodox rabbi, while serving in Melbourne, Australia. Later in 2016, Rabbi Kagedan was hired as rabbi at Modern Orthodox Mount Freedom Jewish Center in Randolph, New Jersey, becoming the first orthodox female rabbi in the United States. Rabbi Kagedan is currently working at Walnut Street Synagogue in Massachusetts. Characteristics Orthodox feminists, using historical precedents and the aforementioned liberal legal interpretations, allow the practice of ritual in manners that more traditional or conservative interpretations consider as befitting only to men. Many of the practices of Orthodox feminists are held to be controversial because of their different approach to the every day routine of most Orthodox Jews.Edah: The Courage to be modern and Orthodox 'Women¬ís Zimmun and Whether Men [Who Are Present] Must Leave' Several specific rituals and practices are of particular concern: =Fighting for Agunot= Agunot are women who have asked for a divorce, or who have been left by their husband, and the husband refuses to grant a get. A get is a Jewish certificate of divorce required for the woman to be able to remarry. Recalcitrant husbands are pressured by society to grant the get to the wife, who is stuck in limbo, without a husband and unable to remarry. Orthodox feminists make a priority of fighting on the behalf of agunot, and the \\"agunah crisis\\". Many fight in organizations specifically for this purpose, and some work independently. =Interaction with The Torah= Kissing the Torah scroll with a siddur (prayer book), hand, or directly with the lips, during Shabbath, Yom Tob, services is a convention found in many Modern Orthodox congregations as well as non-Orthodox ones. While many may take it for granted as an integral part of worship services, it is not practiced in Haredi and Chassidic congregations. Dancing with the Torah and having hakafoth (processional circuits) around the sanctuary on Simhath Torath is another way in which many Orthodox Jews interact with the Torah which is an especially important ritual in feminist circles. These are some reasons why this act has special meaning in Orthodox feminist circles.My Jewish Learning: Orthodox Feminism For The 21st Century - A founder of the Orthodox feminist movement discusses issues confronting the movement now and in the future By Blu Greenberg. =Participation in Zimmunim= One of the most prevalent, and perhaps least controversial practices of Orthodox feminists, even done by some women outside of the movement, is the participation in a women's zimmun. The women's zimmun takes place when less than three men have eaten together, but where three or more women have eaten together. A zimmun is a formal call to prayer said before the communal recitation of Birkath Hamazon. One formula for the women's zimmun is exactly the same formula as the zimmun of men, but substituting 'chaverot' (Hebrew: friends (f.)) for the word 'rabotai' (Hebrew: gentlemen) in the beginning of the invitation, thus femminizing the call. =Use of Prayer Shawls= In Orthodox feminism, the donning of a Taleth (prayer shawl) is not seen as the wearing of a man's garment, neither is it seen as an affront to the community. These reasons coupled with historical precedents, such as the donning of Taletoth by Rashi's daughters in popular legend, make the wearing of Prayer Shawls by women common in Orthodox feminists circles.See Wikipedia: Tallit 5.2 WomenJOFA Links on the wearing of prayer shawls by women. =Use of Tefillin= Citing Talmudic and later sources, Orthodox feminists allow the laying of Tefillin by women. Some Orthodox communities claim that women are not permitted to lay tefillin, as is required by adult men. The duty of laying tefillin rests upon males after the age of thirteen years and one day. Women are exempt from the obligation, as are also slaves and minors (Berakhot 20a). The medieval halachic work Orach Chayyim precludes women who wish to wear tefillin from doing so. In ancient times, this was not the case. There are several instances of women who allegedly wore tefillin. According to a baraita, \\"Michal the daughter of the Cushite [i.e., Saul, cf. Mo'ed Katan 16b] wore tefillin and the sages did not protest\\" (Eruvin 96a). After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, women became increasingly excluded from Jewish ritual activities as rabbinic Judaism become increasingly codified. Women became exempt from almost all time-bound positive commandments: prayer three times a day, sitting in the sukkah, and laying tefillin. The Mishnah tractate entitled Nashim (women) is the most comprehensive dealing with the legal aspects of women‚Äôs roles in Judaism. Medieval Ashkenazi communities represented a high point in women‚Äôs voluntary participation in Judaism, even in aspects supposedly forbidden to them by Talmudic law. Women of Northern France were known to put on tefillin to pray. In addition to tefillin, women were documented as being counted in prayer quorums, and serving as a sandeka'it at circumcision feasts. However, the political and economic situation of European Jewry gradually worsened beginning in the 13th century. In response, communities reverted to more traditional practices, and most of the gains Jewish women had achieved were put to a stop. Activities Orthodox Jewish feminists participate in a number of organized and informal activities which both demonstrate their commitment to their values as both feminists and as Orthodox Jews. Holding conferencesHighBeam Research Gen Xers Take Orthodox Feminist Reins: Modesty, mikveh and sex; New generation makes its own experience the focus at conference of various kinds is a major activity that Orthodox Jewish feminists use to educate, show recognition, and strengthen the movement. JOFA organizes conferences for its members and the public drawing crowds from both North America, and internationally. As well, some Orthodox feminists participate in partnership minyanim and other independent minyanimZEEK DIY Judaism: A Roundtable on the Independent Minyan Phenomenon where they feel comfortable and are permitted to practice Judaism in their unique way. This phenomenon was the topic of discussion of Mechhon Hadar, a conference about independent minyanim.

Biography Lisa Janti, known as Lisa Montell, was a Hollywood actress of the 1950-60s, was born Irena Ludmila Vladimirovna Augustynowic of Russian and Polish descent.Biography Her family fled Poland before World War II. On arrival in New York they changed their last name to Montwill so she grew up Irene Montwill. They lived in New York and Janti attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts but transferred to High School of Performing Arts after it opened in 1948 where she became involved with acting. However her family moved her senior year in high school to Fort Pierce, Florida where she graduated from St. Lucie High School and then began taking courses at the University of Miami. Shortly her family moved to Peru where her father had a business interest. After becoming involved in English-speaking theatre she was noticed by Hollywood producer Dick Welding who offered her a part in Daughter of the Sun God, filmed in Peru c. 1953 with actor William Holmes, (though it wasn't released until 1962.) Shortly afterwards her father died and the family chose to follow the opportunity Hollywood was giving her with her career. Her first role may have been in 1954 in the TV series The Public Defender, based on the film of the same name. In 1956, she joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Janti states that her family background included a diverse religious family history of Orthodox Russian and Islam (paternal grandmother), Catholicism (father & paternal grandfather), Protestant (mother), and Judaism (maternal grandmother). Janti herself was baptized Lutheran. In addition to her diverse background she explored various religions and philosophies, including studying with Manly Palmer Hall, when she learned of the religion. She learned of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith from other actors in a workshop and in her first meeting with Bah√° º√≠s they resolved some questions she still had from her previous studies with the teaching of Progressive Revelation. In addition she had a profound personal experience affirming Bah√° ºu'll√°h. For Janti joining the religion played a role in changing her career from an actor to a social development advocate which she felt was a more fulfilling way of serving the religion than as a celebrity.

The diagonally buttressed four stage tower is broadly unaltered from the Norman period. A number of alterations have occurred over the years, such as in the early 17th century, when it gained a Jacobean screen and communion table, as well as a memorial to the poet Samuel Daniel, who died in the parish in 1619. Further notable alterations occurred in the 18th century, when the nave was reroofed (1754) and two new bells placed in the tower (1756), which were cast by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family. The original six bells were recast and two extras added as part of the restoration of the tower in 1906.

As a broodmare, she produced, or was the mother of, the first American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) Supreme Champion, Kid Meyers. She was the mother of three other foals, and was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 2009. Early life Miss Meyers was a chestnut-colored mare born in 1949 and sired, or fathered, by Leo, a member of the AQHA Hall of Fame. Miss Meyers' dam, or mother, was Star's Lou. Star's Lou's father was Oklahoma Star P-6, another AQHA Hall of Fame member. She was bred by O. C. Meyer, and later owned by Bruce A. Green. Race career Miss Meyers raced from 1952 until 1955 and won seven stakes races, placing second in seven others, and third in two more. She won 17 of her 59 starts on the racetrack. She placed second in another 15 races and third in 5. Her total earnings on the track were $28,727 (approximately $ in dollars).

Background Robinson was the only son and only surviving child of George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon and grandson of Prime Minister F. J. Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon. His mother was Henrietta Anne Theodosia Vyner, daughter of Henry Vyner. He was educated at Eton College. Political career Viscount Goderich was attached to the British commission sent, under his father's head, to Washington to settle the Alabama claims in 1871. Styled Earl de Grey after his father was elevated to a marquessate later in 1871, he entered Parliament for Ripon in 1874, a seat he held until 1880. A long time friend of King Edward VII, in July 1901 he was appointed Treasurer to Queen Alexandra. He was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in December 1901, and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) in 1909. In 1909 he succeeded his father in the marquessate and took his seat in the House of Lords. He was Captain of the 27th West Riding of Yorkshire Volunteers in 1870, and JP for the counties of North and West Ridings and the Liberty of Ripon. He was also a trustee of the Wallace Collection and a supporter of the Royal Opera House. Sporting interests Lord Ripon was a fast, accurate game shooter, who was noted to down 28 pheasants in sixty seconds as a shooting party guest on the Sandringham House estate. He also holds the record of the greatest recorded lifetime bag of birds shot: 556,000, including 241,000 pheasants. Personal life Lord Ripon married Constance Gwladys Herbert, daughter of Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea and widow of St George Lowther, 4th Earl of Lonsdale, in 1885. She was a noted patron of the arts, friend among many other artists to Oscar Wilde and Nellie Melba. They had no children. She died in October 1917, aged 58. Lord Ripon survived her by nearly six years and died on 22 September 1923, aged 71, having collapsed on Dallowgill Moor near Studley Royal Park, after shooting 52 birds that morning. He was buried at St Mary's, Studley Royal on 26 September, and on his death all his titles became extinct. Edith, the grandmother of the author Barbara Taylor Bradford, worked as a servant for the Marquess, and lived in properties owned by him. She named two of her illegitimate children Freda and Frederick. Taylor Bradford's biographer, Piers Dudgeon, uncovered evidence that their father was the Marquess. Edith later lived in a workhouse.

Cultural criminology is a subfield in the study of crime that focuses on the ways in which the \\"dynamics of meaning underpin every process in criminal justice, including the definition of crime itself.\\"Ilan, Jonathan. 2019. ‚ÄúCultural Criminology: The Time Is Now.‚Äù Critical Criminology 27(1):5‚Äì20. In other words, cultural criminology seeks to understand crime through the context of culture and cultural processes.Ferrell, Jeff, Keith Hayward, and Jock Young. 2008. Cultural Criminology: An Investigation. Los Angeles: SAGE. . Rather than representing a conclusive paradigm per se, this particular form of criminological analysis interweaves a broad range of perspectives that share a sensitivity to ‚Äúimage, meaning, and representation‚Äù to evaluate the convergence of cultural and criminal processes.Ferrell, Jeff. 1999. ‚ÄúCultural Criminology.‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 25(1):395‚Äì418. As opposed to other theories, cultural criminology views crime in the context of an offenders culture as a motive to commit crime. The theory gives motives to a crime, whereas other theories, such as rational choice theory, explain what was gained.  Background  Sociologist Jack Katz is recognized by many as being the foundational figure to this approachFerrell, Jeff. 1992. \\"Making sense of crime: A review essay on Jack Katz's 'Seductions of Crime'\\". Social Justice 19(23): 110‚Äì23. Retrieved from JSTOR: https://www.jstor.org/stable/29766697 through his seminal work, Seductions of Crime, written in 1988.Katz, Jack. 1988. Seductions of Crime: Moral and Sensual Attractions in Doing Evil. New York: Basic Books. . Cultural criminology as a substantive approach, however, did not begin to form until the mid-1990s,Ferrell, Jeff, and Clinton Sanders, eds. 1995. Cultural Criminology. Boston: Northeastern University Press. . where increasing interest arose from the desire to incorporate cultural studies into contemporary criminology. Developed in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the approach has had transnational impacts. Recent theories within cultural criminology take into account the role of space (such as urban space) in the construction of crime, positing, for example, that where an action takes place is as important as the effect of the action in determining criminality. The roles of excitement and control in cultural criminology has laid the foundation for the sociological concept of \\"edgework\\".Lyng, Stephen. 1990. \\"Edgework: A social psychological analysis of voluntary risk taking.\\" American Journal of Sociology 95(4):851‚Äì86. DOI: 10.1086/229379. Retrieved from JSTOR: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2780644. Edgework's focus on prototypically masculine, high-risk pursuits has been criticised by a number of feminist criminologists. More recent works, however, suggest that edgework can be applied to either gender.Rajah, Valli. 2007. \\"Resistance as edgework in violent intimate relationships of drug-involved women.\\" British Journal of Criminology 47(2):196‚Äì213. DOI: 10.1093/bjc/azl064 = Purpose = In Katz (1988) and other works, the goal is to find the overlap between the emotions associated with everyday life and those associated with crime.Young, Jock. 2003. \\"Merton with energy, Katz with structure: The sociology of vindictiveness and the criminology of transgression.\\" Theoretical Criminology 7(3): 388‚Äì414. DOI: 10.1177/13624806030073007. As such, one of the main tenets of cultural criminology is the role of affect in crime. Jeff Ferrell, cited by many scholars as a forerunner of the subfield as it is known today, describes the purpose of cultural criminology as being to investigate ‚Äúthe stylized frameworks and experiential dynamics of illicit subcultures; the symbolic criminalization of popular culture forms; and the mediated construction of crime and crime control issues.‚Äù Moreover, the approach has often been used to demonstrate the ways in which power affects the construction of crime, such as the creation and breaking of law, as well as the interplay of moral entrepreneurship, moral innovation, and transgression.Hayward, Keith, and Jock Young. 2012. \\"Cultural Criminology.\\" In The Oxford Handbook of Criminology (5th ed.), edited by M. Maguire, R. Morgan, and R. Reiner. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. . = Influences = Since the approach itself consists of a m√©lange of various perspectives linked together by dynamics of meaning, deliberations in this domain often invoke an assortment of theoretical elements. Cultural criminological analysis unambiguously roots itself in interactionist and constructionist tradition. More specifically, such approach concedes Howard Becker‚Äôs (1963) labelling theory, while augmenting it with a phenomenological dimension that considers the ‚Äúwebs of meaning and perception in which all parties are entangled.‚Äù Along with interactionist and constructionist theories, as well as ideas posed by Katz and Becker, cultural criminological work tends to explicitly cite, or be reminiscent of, the following theories and/or theorists among others: * Jean Baudrillard and his theory of ‚Äúsimulacra‚Äù * Max Weber * Clifford Geertz and the \\"webs of significance\\"Nelson, Kristopher A. 2007. \\"'Webs of Significance,' Clifford Geertz.\\" In Propria Persona: https://inpropriapersona.com/articles/webs-of- significance-clifford-geertz/.

Ethnography at the Edge: Crime, Deviance, and Field Research. Boston, US: Northeastern University Press. . or the main qualitative research techniques associated with the scholarly readings. Cultural criminologists today also employ research methods such as participatory action research or \\"narrative criminology\\". They remain constant, however, in their rejection of abstract empiricism.Young, Jock. 2010. Criminological Imagination. Oxford, UK: University Of Kent. . Criticism Some critics have argued that cultural criminology has foregone hard-nosed economic analysis in the interest of a subjective or narrow cultural focus. Cultural criminologists counter that they are striving to create a sociologically inspired criminology attuned to the distinctive dynamics of the contemporary economy. They contend that the expansion of the global market has brought new forms of crime, crime control, and political resistance.

Eisenhower's staff. Yates and his British counterpart, James Martin Stagg, chose well - it turned out to be the only day that month the English Channel could have been successfully crossed. Yates was subsequently decorated by three governments. He went on to become the chief meteorologist of the newly formed U.S. Air Force, and Commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida.

He won with Sword Dancer in 1959, with Quadrangle in 1964 when he thwarted Northern Dancer's bid for the 1964 Triple Crown, and his third Belmont in 1969 with Arts and Letters. In the pre-Breeders Cup era, Burch won such fall classics as the Washington, D.C. International Stakes in 1967, 1970, and 1971 and the Travers Stakes in 1959, 1964, 1969, and 1972. =Horses trained= * Sword Dancer ** U.S. Champion 3-Yr-Old Colt (1959) ** U.S. Champion Male Handicap Horse (1959) ** American Horse of the Year (1959) ** United States Racing Hall of Fame (1977) * Bowl of Flowers ** U.S. Champion two-year-old filly (1960) ** U.S. Champion three-year-old filly (1961) ** United States' Racing Hall of Fame (2004) * Fort Marcy ** American Champion Male Turf Horse (1967, 1970) ** American Co-Champion Male Turf Horse (1968) ** American Champion Older Male Horse (1970) ** American Co-Champion Horse of the Year (1970) ** United States Racing Hall of Fame (1998) * Arts and Letters ** U.S. Champion 3-Yr-Old Colt (1969) ** U.S. Champion Handicap Male Horse (1969) ** American Horse of the Year (1969) ** United States Racing and Hall of Fame (1994) * Run the Gantlet ** American Champion Male Turf Horse (1971) * Key to the Mint ** U.S. Champion 3-Yr-Old Colt (1972) In 1980, Elliott Burch was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

The Merrimack is one of the larger waterways in the New England region and has helped define the livelihood and culture of those living along it since native times. Major cities in the Merrimack Valley include Concord, Manchester and Nashua in New Hampshire, as well as Lowell, Lawrence and Haverhill, in Massachusetts. The Merrimack Valley was a major center of the textile industry in America during the 19th century.  Geography and demographics  Massachusetts = 400px The Merrimack Valley area in Massachusetts is a community of towns and cities surrounding the Merrimack River along the New Hampshire border, a portion of which is defined by a line approximately 3 miles from the Merrimack. The cities (marked with italics) and towns in this area are: *Amesbury *Andover *Billerica *Boxford *Chelmsford *Dracut *Georgetown *Groveland *Haverhill *Lawrence *Lowell *Merrimac *Methuen *Newbury *Newburyport *North Andover *Rowley *Salisbury *Tewksbury *Tyngsborough *West Newbury The population of the region in 2010 was 631,477 residents, or slightly more than the city of Boston's at the time, and about one tenth of the state. The Merrimack Valley contains a mixture of 19th-century industrial cities and mill complexes built to take advantage of the river's waterpower, modern suburbs (many built over towns dating from the 17th century), and some relatively rural areas. The western portion, including Greater Lowell and Haverhill/Lawrence/Methuen, is generally more urbanized than the eastern portion. The entire Merrimack Valley region within Massachusetts is a component of Greater Boston. Automobile travel through the Massachusetts section of the Merrimack Valley is served primarily by Interstate 495. From Lowell and Lawrence, U.S. Route 3 and Interstate 93, respectively, head north along the valley, joining in Manchester, New Hampshire. = New Hampshire = Towns in the Merrimack Valley of New Hampshire In New Hampshire, the Merrimack Valley Region is an area of the south-central portion of the state, approximately wide, centered on the Merrimack River and running from Canterbury south to the Massachusetts border. Henniker marks the western extent, and Nottingham the east. It includes portions of Hillsborough, Rockingham and Merrimack counties, namely the following towns and cities (in italics): *Allenstown *Amherst *Atkinson *Auburn *Bedford *Boscawen *Bow *Brookline *Candia *Canterbury *Chester *Chichester *Concord *Deerfield *Derry *Dunbarton *Epsom *Goffstown *Henniker *Hollis *Hooksett *Hopkinton *Hudson *Litchfield *Londonderry *Loudon *Manchester *Merrimack *Milford *Mont Vernon *Nashua *New Boston *Northwood *Nottingham *Pelham *Pembroke *Raymond *Salem *Warner *Weare *Webster *Windham The state capital of Concord, and the state's two largest cities, Manchester and Nashua are located within the valley. Manchester boasts a large regional airport, with scheduled commercial services. To the east is the Seacoast Region, to the west is the Monadnock Region, and the Lakes Region is to the north. Interstate 93 bisects the region which is also served by Interstate 293, U.S. Route 3 and many New Hampshire state highways. History and culture The second largest city on the Merrimack River, Lowell, owes its existence to the waterpower the river provided to run its mills. = Pre- contact = The original settlers of the Merrimack Valley were various tribes of the Pennacook Indians. The river provided an easy means of transportation, an exceptional source of salmon as well as other fish, and the land along the river banks was suitable for hunting and sometimes farming. However, much of the soil is full of granite, and the pine forests provide poor soil. = Colonization and the early federal period = The earliest European records of the river date to a French expedition under Pierre du Guast, Sieur de Monts, in 1605. By 1629, the British were moving into the area, and a land grant delineated by the river was made to a Jonathan Wheelwright in 1629. The city of Newburyport, first settled in 1635, at the river's mouth, became an important shipbuilding center during the colonial era, using lumber floated downriver from the White Mountains. Its prominence was diminished when the Middlesex Canal was completed in the first quarter of the 19th century, allowing lumber to be shipped directly downriver from the White Mountains to Charlestown, Massachusetts, and improving connections between Boston and the Merrimack Valley. Prior to this time, other small canals had been built around falls and rapids to make the Merrimack navigable, such as the Pawtucket Canal at East Chelmsford, which became Lowell. = Industrial revolution = The Amoskeag Mills in West Manchester, New Hampshire, circa 2006. The massive structure once housed the largest cotton textile manufacturing plant in the world. Since the late 20th century, it has been rehabilitated for mixed use development. While the Merrimack had been used for small manufacturing concerns for decades, in the early 1820s, a group of investors from Boston founded the city of Lowell, to take advantage of the drop of the Merrimack over the Pawtucket Falls. Lowell, the first large-scale planned textile center in America, remained the nation's largest into the 1850s. Textile production spread up and down the Merrimack Valley in both states for the next century, but eventually was eclipsed after the Second World War. Manchester's Amoskeag Mills was once the largest cotton textile plant in the world. Other major textile companies based in the Merrimack Valley included the Merrimack Manufacturing Company in Lowell, the American Woolen Company in Lawrence (headquarters moved to Andover in 1919), Pemberton Mill in Lawrence, and the Nashua Manufacturing Company in its namesake city. Lawrence was the site of the Bread and Roses strike, a landmark event in the history of labor relations in the United States. = Modern era = Merrimack River watershed After World War II, the textile industry collapsed rapidly. After a few decades of stagnation, the \\"Massachusetts Miracle\\" came to the valley, bringing the headquarters of Wang Laboratories to Tewksbury, then Lowell. Apollo Computer located in Chelmsford and Nashua Corporation in Nashua moved beyond printing to computer products. The defense industry, for example, Raytheon in various sites and Sanders Associates in Nashua, became a major local employer. Increased development pressure from Greater Boston and the proliferation of the automobile pushed development outside of Massachusetts Route 128 to Interstate 495 and up Routes 3 and 93 into southern New Hampshire, greatly increasing the populations of these communities over the postwar years. On September 13, 2018, several gas lines suffered leakage due to high pressure in the tubes of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, causing several fires and explosions, and homes were evacuated. = Culture = The Merrimack River Valley is considered the \\"Valley of the Poets\\" by some local artists and poets. Anne Dudley Bradstreet was a founding mother of three towns in the Massachusetts Bay Colony: Boston, Cambridge (then Newtowne), and the original Andover Parish, known now as North Andover, where she lived and wrote for the last half of her life. The first published poet of the New World, she died in North Andover in 1672. In Haverhill and Amesbury, the family of John Greenleaf Whittier settled. Mr. Whittier was so well thought of during his lifetime, his birthday was celebrated as a national holiday. Lawrence is the birthplace of actress Thelma Todd, composer/conductor Leonard Bernstein and actor/singer Robert Goulet. Robert Frost spent his teenage years there, as did his future wife, Elinor Miriam White They were co-valedictorians (1892) at Lawrence High School. Actress Bette Davis and the writer Jack Kerouac were born in Lowell. The Merrimack Valley is one of the few places in the United States where the card game Forty-fives is popular. The Merrimack Valley's leading boarding schools, such as Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts; Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts; St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire; and The Governor's Academy in Newbury, Massachusetts, provide cultural institutions to the public, including the Addison Gallery of American Art and the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology in Andover. EconomyMassachusetts= The Merrimack Valley in Massachusetts is divided into three New England city and town areas (NECTAs) by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget: Lowell‚ÄìBillerica‚ÄìChelmsford, MA‚ÄìNH; Lawrence‚ÄìMethuen Town‚ÄìNorth Andover, MA‚ÄìNH; and Haverhill‚ÄìNewburyport‚ÄìAmesbury Town, MA‚ÄìNH. Most large employers are in the sectors of health care and higher education. Institutes of higher learning include Hockey East rivals UMass Lowell and Merrimack College. The region was once a technology hub, reaching its peak during the 1970s and 1980s with corporations such as Wang Laboratories in Lowell among the largest technology employers, though it has since gone defunct. Software company Kronos Incorporated is one of the largest private employers in the region, as is Philips, whose medical division is based in Andover. The defense industry also has had a major presence in the Merrimack Valley, Massachusetts-based Raytheon has several large plants and offices in the Merrimack Valley, and BAE Systems Inc. also employs many people. Due to its proximity to Boston, the region also serves as a bedroom community for employers in Boston. Many major highways (including I-93, I-95, and US 3) and several heavily used lines of the MBTA Commuter Rail system provide easy access to the city from the Merrimack Valley. =New Hampshire= While the textile industry that served as the underpinning of the Merrimack Valley has disappeared, the region has since transferred to other economic activities. Sanders Associates, a major defense contractor based in Nashua has, through several mergers and acquisitions, become a division of BAE Systems Inc. and is one of the regions largest employers. Technology companies also have a large presence in the region, including mobile phone company Verizon, which is the largest private employer in Manchester. The financial industry is also a major employer, with Lincoln Financial in Concord and Fidelity Investments in Merrimack among the largest private employers. The area between Manchester, Nashua, and Salem was once described as the \\"Golden Triangle\\" of New Hampshire. The name was due to job growth that fueled a housing boom and led to the creation of several major new retail centers, including the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester, the Mall at Rockingham Park in Salem, and the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua. This area contains roughly 30% of the population of New Hampshire. Attractions include: *Bear Brook State Park *Canobie Lake Park, an amusement park *McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, a planetarium/air and space museum *New Hampshire Historical Society Museum *New Hampshire State House *Pawtuckaway State Park *Robert Frost Farm, a state historic park *Silver Lake State Park Institutions of higher education include: *New England College, Henniker *New Hampshire Institute of Art, Manchester *Rivier University, Nashua *Saint Anselm College, Goffstown *Southern New Hampshire University, Manchester and Hooksett *University of New Hampshire at Manchester *University of New Hampshire School of Law, Concord See also * Merrimack Valley Conference, a high school athletic conference in Massachusetts ReferencesExternal links *Merrimack Valley Economic Development Council (Massachusetts) *Merrimack Valley Magazine *Merrimack Valley Dining of Massachusetts Category:New England Category:Regions of New Hampshire Category:Tourism regions of New Hampshire Category:Regions of Massachusetts Category:Merrimack River Category:Geography of New England ","title":"Merrimack Valley"},{"id":"22823261","text":"Platforms is a junction railway station in the town of Taketoyo, Chita District, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, operated by Meitetsu.

HHV-7 is a member of Betaherpesvirinae, a subfamily of the Herpesviridae that also includes HHV-6 and Cytomegalovirus (HHV-5 or HCMV). HHV-7 often acts together with HHV-6, and the viruses together are sometimes referred to by their genus, Roseolovirus. HHV-7 was first isolated in 1990 from CD4+ T cells taken from peripheral blood lymphocytes.  Signs and symptoms  Both HHV-6B and HHV-7, as well as other viruses, can cause a skin condition in infants known as exanthema subitum, although HHV-7 causes the disease less frequently than HHV-6B. HHV-7 infection also leads to or is associated with a number of other symptoms, including acute febrile respiratory disease, fever, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, low lymphocyte counts, and febrile seizures, though most often no symptoms present at all. There are indications that HHV-7 can contribute to the development of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, encephalopathy, hemiconvulsion- hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome, hepatitis infection, postinfectious myeloradiculoneuropathy, pityriasis rosea, and the reactivation of HHV-4, leading to \\"mononucleosis-like illness\\". Complications with HHV-7 infection has been shown to be a factor in a great variety of transplant types.  Virology  Structure = A mature virus particle measures about in diameter. The genome of HHV-7 is very similar to that of HHV-6, although it is about 10% smaller, with a DNA genome of about 145,000 base pairs. There are a number of key differences between the genome of HHV-7 and that of HHV-6, but the importance of them for viral DNA replication is not yet known. = Cellular effects = HHV-7 resides mostly in CD4+ T cells, albeit only in certain strains of them. To enter CD4+ T cells, HHV-7, unlike HHV-6, uses CD4 and possibly some cell-surface glyoproteins to enter CD4+ T cells. About a week after HHV-7 has infected a cell, it begins to downregulate CD4 transcription, which interferes with HIV-1 infection but may reactivate HHV-6 infection. It is however unclear exactly what effect HHV-7 has on HIV infection. HHV-7 also has a number of other effects on cells. Among these include membrane leaking, the presence of lytic syncytia, occasional apoptosis, the supporting of latent infection, and increases and decreases in levels of certain cytokines.  Detection and treatment  In adults, the effects of HHV-7 separate from HHV-6 have not been well-researched. One reason for this is because the detection of HHV-7 was at first difficult to do quickly, as the process for doing so involves a procedure that is difficult to do in commercial laboratories and because viral isolation and serological testing are long processes that do not lend themselves to finishing quickly. A process known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has recently been developed to speed up detection of HHV-7, although a larger sample size of patients must be tested first to see if the test will still work across a broad range of subjects. No reliable serological test has been developed yet for HHV-7 alone, but multiple are in the process of being developed. The use of PCR assays to test for HHV-7 is also being explored. No treatment for HHV-7 infection exists, but no clinical situation where such treatment would be useful has yet been discovered.  Epidemiology  Over 95% of adults have been infected and are immune to HHV-7, and over three quarters of those were infected before the age of six. Primary infection of HHV-7 among children generally occurs between the ages of 2 and 5, which means it occurs after primary infection of HHV-6. A 2014 Washington University School of Medicine's analysis of 102 healthy adults sampled at as many as five major body habitats found that HHV-7 was present in 98% of them, especially in the mouth. A 2017 study looking at the human blood virome in 8,240 humans between the ages of 2 months to 102 years found that 20.37% of them were positive for HHV-7.

Silao, April 25, 1915 ‚Äì Mexico City, May 16, 1982) was a Mexican painter, and engraver. His work was recognized with membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana and was a founding member of the Sociedad Mexicana de Grabadores. Life The son of a carpenter and a schoolteacher, Pe√±a was born in Silao, Guanajuato but moved with his family to the Tlalpan borough of Mexico City in 1926. He completed primary school there, where his talent for drawing and painting was first recognized. As there was no middle school near the family‚Äôs home at the time, his mother enrolled him instead in the Escuela de Pinura al Aire Libre, where he studied from 1928 to 1932 under Tamiji Kitagawa kitagawa and Francisco D√≠az de Le√≥n. He studied oil painting and printmaking, becoming exceptional at the latter. In 1930 he participated in the American Art Federation Exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He also did work for at a children‚Äôs magazine called Pulgarcito, published by the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. Pe√±a died in Mexico City in 1982. Career Pe√±a began his career in 1933 at age eighteen, receiving a grant, teaching art classes and his first individual exhibition at the Sala de Art of the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. His teaching career spanned twenty six years, primarily at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" and the Escuela de Artes del Libro (Escuela de Artes Gr√°ficas). Early in his career he moved to Xalapa, Veracruz and founded a painting school with Francisco Gutierrez and Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado. The three also painted a 155m2 mural called Anti-fascismo at the Escuela Normal Superior in 1936. However, it was covered over because a female nude in Gutierrez‚Äôs section was considered obscene. In 1961, students at the school tried to recover the mural but the parts done by Pe√±a were permanently destroyed. Other notable exhibitions include a work called ‚ÄúAutorretrato‚Äù in 1942 at the Galeria Espira, which first brought him widespread attention. From 1947 to 1979 he exhibited his works at the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicana. In 1949, he was invited to exhibit individually for the inauguration of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, and as a member, exhibited there occasionally as well. Pe√±a participated in the first Interamerican Painting and Engraving biennial in 1958 and in the Retrato mexicano contempor√°neo in 1961, both at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. He also participated in the 20 siglos de arte mexicano exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Arte mexicano, de los precoolumbinos hasta nuestros d√≠as, at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1952. As an engraver he produced an album called Estampas de M√©xico in 1949 and several vignettes for publications such as Ruta, El hijo pr√≥digo, Frente a frente, Artes del libro and Artes de M√©xico. He contributed to the book La ciudad de M√©xico in 1957 with a linoleum engraving of the Ciudad Universitaria . In addition to membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, he was also a member of the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios and was a founding member of the Sociedad Mexicana de Grabadores, in 1947. During his lifetime he did not receive full recognition for his work, included from himself. The only notable award was the adquistion prize from the Sal√≥n Anual de Pintura in 1957 of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. In 1984, shortly after his death, the Lourdes Chumancero Gallery held an exhibit in his honor. Later in 2011, another was held at the Museo de Arte e Historia in Guanajuato. Pita Amor wrote a poem about him and his work, and in 1999, art critic Raquel Tibol published a book on Pe√±a‚Äôs life called Feliciano Pe√±a. De la honradez y el arraigo professional. Artistry Pe√±a¬¥s first influences were his teachers in Tlalpan, D√≠az de Le√≥n and Kitagawa. His early production was somewhat primitive but with a sense for drawing and color. As a printmaker/engraver, he worked in relief and photogravure and grain wood. He created few color prints but was very prolific in black-and-white. He is best known for his landscape painting even though he did portraits, still lifes and human figures. His style is a faithful representation of nature, without distortion of form or light. His representation is more ‚Äúclassical‚Äù than that of Impressionism, done in clean luminous colors with attention given to volume. One of his influences was Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco, with a similar perspective painting valleys, gulleys, groves and observations points. Raquel Tibol stated, ‚ÄúFeliciano Pe√±a did not want to possess nature but rather to understand it in a dimension that would be apprehensible both physically and mentally.‚Äù  References  Category:20th-century Mexican painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Mexican male painters Category:Mexican sculptors Category:Mexican engravers Category:Mexican muralists Category:Artists from Guanajuato Category:People from Silao, Guanajuato Category:1915 births Category:1982 deaths Category:20th-century engravers Category:Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" faculty Category:20th-century sculptors Category:20th-century printmakers ","title":"Feliciano Pe√±a"},{"id":"22823358","text":"Prolates is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish.

On the 1 February 1915 Siegel was captured and on 6 February he was brought into the receiving ship at New York City by Detective W. L. Beers of 60 Wall Street New York City.

Working in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard the Mohawk rushed to give aid to a burning ship, the schooner Hjeltenaes, which was tied up along the Beltline Bridge. Siegel was able to rescue two men from the crew's quarters and was going back a third time when he was trapped by a burst steam pipe. Overcome by the smoke, Siegel collapsed and had to be rescued by his shipmates. Medical officers worked on him most of the night fearing he would die. For his actions Siegel was recommended and awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor along with a $100 gratuity.(Navy Department Letter (N-640-AVP-EHA-B) 5 March 1919)(Washington DC news: 26 Mar 1919) After a short recovery Siegel went back to the Receiving Ship in Norfolk, VA until March 1919 when he transferred to the USS Hopewell. On 16 June 1919 Siegel was once again wanted for desertion for a period of three months and six days. He was sentenced to six months restriction to Ship or Station and maintain a satisfactory record to terminate at any time after three months at the discretion of the commanding officer. Approved on 22 October 1919, the restrictions were to terminate 27 January 1920. However on 15 March 1920 he was charged for falsehood and attempting to obtain money under false pretenses and the Commanding Officer ordered the dishonorable discharge of his second enlistment. Prior to his court-martial Siegel underwent a mental evaluation during which he stated he had been worried and exceedingly nervous for several months prior to his nomination for the Medal of Honor. He had been worried over domestic affairs and depressed after recently learning that he was adopted. However he was found fit for trial.

Medal Inscription Later life By 1920, after Siegel received a \\"less than honorable\\" discharge from the Navy, he continued to work as a driver. Later, it is believed Siegel worked as an ironworker on the Brooklyn Bridge or simply a bridge in Brooklyn, according to family. In May 1929 Siegel wrote to the Navy and requested they give him a 3rd enlistment. He was unsuccessful in his plea. He was living at the Hotel Delaware in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Around 1930, Siegel abandoned his wife and daughter and headed to Oklahoma to work in the oil fields. They never divorced and he started a new life, never having any contact with them again. In 1935, Siegel is found to be in Lavagas (believing it to be Las Vegas) per the 1940 Census records, and in 1940, Siegel is found in Baltimore, Maryland,16th Census of the United States:1940) Maryland, Baltimore City, Ward 23, Block 26, S.D.No. 3, E.D.

On 28 May 1935 the New York chapter of the Red Cross wrote a letter on behalf of John Otto Siegel to the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, Washington D.C. requesting a duplicate Medal of Honor be issued.Red Cross request The letter states that in November 1934 John was employed as an \\"Iron Worker\\" on the Boulder Dam project, in the \\"Death Valley Junction\\" of Nevada and that during this time a fire swept through the camp, believed to be Williamsville (known to its inhabitants as Ragtown) destroying all his belongings including his medal and service documents. On June 17, 1935 the Bureau replied with instruction on how to apply for a replacement medal. On 26 November 1936 Siegel made another request that the Navy allow him to reenlist. On 5 and 16 April 1941 Siegel wrote to the Navy requesting a replacement Medal of Honor and ribbon bar pin or at least a letter stating he was the holder of the Medal of Honor or a new station. He stated it was lost in a home fire. His return address is listed as 110 Madison Street San Antonio, Texas. On 31 July 1941 his request is denied due to his dishonorable discharge and his previous replacement medal was sent contrary to existing instructions due to same. His ruling is compared to the Judge Advocate General's ruling on Medal of Honor nominee William Henry Jaeger, for actions 16 July 1900; with two less than honorable discharges he was approved for the Medal of Honor but the medal was not to be delivered.1941 Memorandum denying issue of a replacement Medal of Honor On 25 April 1942 Siegel filed a World War II Registration Card under the name John Robert Siegel, born in New York City.

The operations were conducted to realise the Germanization of the western regions of occupied Poland, before territorial annexation to the German Reich. The mass murder operations of Intelligenzaktion killed 100,000 Polish people; by way of forced disappearance, the Nazis imprisoned and killed selected citizens of Polish society, identified before the war as enemies of the Reich; they were buried in mass graves at remote places. To facilitate the depopulation of Poland, the Nazis terrorised the general populace with the public, summary executions of selected intellectuals and community leaders, before effecting the expulsions of the general population from occupied Poland. The executioners of the Einsatzgruppen death squads and the local Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, the German-minority militia, pretended that their police-work was meant to eliminate politically dangerous people from Polish society. The Intelligenzaktion was a major step towards implementing Sonderaktion Tannenberg (Special Operation Tannenberg), the installation of Nazi policemen and functionaries ‚Äî from the SiPo (composed of the Kripo and Gestapo), and the SD ‚Äî to manage the occupation and facilitate the realisation of Generalplan Ost, the German colonization of Poland.Prof. Dietrich Eichholtz (2004), ¬ªGeneralplan Ost¬´ zur Versklavung osteurop√§ischer V√∂lker. PDF file, direct download 74.5 KB. Among the 100,000 people killed in the Intelligenzaktion operations, approximately 61,000 were of the Polish intelligentsia, whom the Nazis identified as political targets in the Special Prosecution Book-Poland, compiled before the war began in September 1939.Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski, Holocaust of Non-Jewish Poles During WWII. Polish American Congress, Washington. The Intelligenzaktion occurred soon after the German invasion of Poland (1 September 1939), and lasted from the autumn of 1939 until the spring of 1940; the mass murder of the Polish intellectuals continued with the operations of the AB-Aktion.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust: ethnic strife, collaboration with occupying forces and genocide in the Second Republic, 1918-1947, McFarland, 1998, p. 25.

EK stands for Einsatzkommando death squad, and EG stands for Einsatzgruppen authorities. Adolf Hitler ordered the murder of the intelligentsia and the social √©lites of Poland to prevent them from organising the Poles against their German masters, and thwart the occupation and colonisation of the country; the mass murder was to occur before the annexation of Poland to the Greater Germanic Reich:International Military Tribunal at Nurnberg, Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Office of the United States Chief of Counsel For Prosecution of Axis Criminality. Nuremberg 1946. Chapter XIII. Germanization and Spoliation. Nazi racialism considered the Polish √©lites as being most likely of German blood, because their style of dynamic leadership contrasted positively against the ‚ÄúSlavonic fatalism‚Äù of the Russian people;Richard C. Lukas, Did the Children Cry? Hitler's War against Jewish and Polish Children, 1939-1945. Hippocrene Books, New York, 2001. nonetheless, the extermination of such national leaders was necessary, because their patriotism (moral authority) would prevent the full-scale Germanization of the enslaved populace of Poland.Northwestern University, Hitlers Plans for Eastern Europe www.dac.neu.edu 2012. Moreover, by way of the Rassenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP (Nazi Party Office of Racial Policy), the racially valuable (Aryan-looking) children of the Polish intelligentsia were to be kidnapped to the Reich proper, for Germanization; Nazi ideology claimed that such non-Slavic acculturation would prevent the generational resurgence of the Polish intelligentsia, and thus prevent the resurgence of Polish nationalism in Germanised Poland.  Method  Upon controlling Poland, the German Nazis arrested, imprisoned, and killed approximately 61,000 people as enemies of the German Reich, all of whom were identified as the intelligentsia of each city, town, and village. Each man and woman was biographically listed in the Special Prosecution Book-Poland (Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen), which German citizens of Poland loyal to the Nazi party in the German Reich compiled before the war for the German police and security forces of the SiPo (Security Police) and the SD (Security Service). The Einsatzgruppen and the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, the Ethnic Self-defence militia of the German minority in Poland, were to kill the intelligentsia identified in the Special Prosecution Book‚ÄìPoland. Aware they would be killing unarmed civilians, the commanders of the paramilitary militias strengthened morale with ideological and racialist instructions to the soldier‚Äìpolicemen, that their political role in the ethnic cleansing of Poland (executions, counterinsurgency, policing) would be more difficult than fighting in battle against soldiers; as noted by Martin Borman, in a meeting (2 October 1940) between Hitler and Hans Frank: As part of Generalplan Ost, the political purpose of the Intelligenzaktion was extermination of the √©lites of Polish society, which the Nazis broadly defined as the Szlachta (Polish nobles), the intelligentsia, teachers, social workers, judges, military veterans, priests and businessmen; any Polish man and woman who had attended secondary school, and so could provide nationalist leadership to resist the Nazi occupation of Poland.  Regional operations  # Intelligenzaktion Pommern, a regional mass murder operation in the Pomeranian Voivodeship; 23,000 Poles were arrested, imprisoned, and killed soon after identification and arrest.

They would migrate into fresh-water to spawn, albeit not as successfully as other anadromous species, as Occithrissops and other open-ocean osteoglossiformes did not survive the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, while other members retreated to Gondwana rivers before the continent broke up. Paleobiology Occithrissops was a small but violent nektonic carnivore, residing in an ecological niche similar to the barracuda and the piranha. It was distributed throughout the Jurassic Oceans, congregating frequently and preying upon smaller forage fish of the period. Larger adults would become solitary while younger members continued to congregate for protection. It is believed that they participated in Lepidophagy. Thrissops were believed to be their primary prey, or a competitor for prey. They were common prey to many predators of that area including Leedsichthys, many Ichthyosaur species and Plesiosaur members. Natural Threats The Occithrissops, despite being an agile and advanced piscivorous predatory fish, only reached a maximum length of , outsized by a large menagerie of different species that generally preyed upon it, or were specialized ecologically to hunt for fish species that included it. Being a pelagic forage fish made it an accessible, predictable and easy prey for Jurassic marine reptiles. The appearance of the first metriorhynchid crocodilians appeared during the height of the epoch in which Occithrissops were most common, and many partial specimens were found in the stomachs of recovered metriorhynchid fossils.B. Schaeffer and C. Patterson. 1984. Jurassic fishes from the western United States, with comments on Jurassic fish distribution. American Museum Novitates 2796:1-86 This fish's teeth were small and tailored towards capture rather than inflicting any defensive wounds to any predators larger than itself. Disappearance Occithrissops and many other small marine Jurassic fish were subject to massive oceanic acidification and sea-level fluctuationsT.M. Quan, B. van de Schootbrugge, M.P. Field, \\"Nitrogen isotope and trace metal analyses from the Mingolsheim core (Germany): Evidence for redox variations across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary\\", Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 22 2008: \\"a series of events resulting in a long period of stratification, deep-water hypoxia, and denitrification in this region of the Tethys Ocean basin\\"; M.

This would reduce the number of members living in the ocean, making the pressures of predation from very large predators such as ichthyosaurs, pliosaurs, and marine crocodilians of the families Teleosauridae and Metriorhynchidae too high. The disappearance of Occithrissops and other small fish was followed by the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic extinction event.

It is the remains of a three-masted armed vessel. It was discovered in 2003 but it was not made public until March 2007. History Christine af Bro, a modern Swedish replica of a bojort, It has been suggested that the wreck is the remains of a ship called Kr√∂nta Lejonet (\\"The Crowned Lion\\") that belonged to Swedish nobleman Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. This ship disappear from the written sources around 1660. In May 2017 Dr Niklas Eriksson at Stockholm University revealed the original identity of the wreck as the Bodekull of the Swedish navy. Bodekull was built in 1659-61 and sank in October 1678.https://www.archaeology.su.se/english/about-us/news/unique-17th-century- shipwreck-identified-1.331904 also https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1095-9270.12297 The sculptures associating to the ships name were usually located on the transom in the ships stern in these days. Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie A glass bottle brought up from the ship bears an impressed crest of the Boynton or Ogle family, who both were based in Northumberland in northern England. Through dendrochronological analysis it has been determined that the timber used for the ship was cut no later than 1628 in Northern Europe, perhaps in Northumberland. A trade route linked Stockholm, Newcastle and Amsterdam in the mid-17th century. In this triangular trade, Swedish brass was exported to England where, among other things, Newcastle coal was taken on. The coal, for which the local market in Stockholm was too small, would have been sold in part at Amsterdam where products like imported wine were loaded for export back to Sweden. When the ship sank it was carrying coal originating from England or Germany and stoneware Bartmann jugs that most likely contained wine. The glass bottle is believed to have been manufactured sometime between 1640 and 1670. One of the Bartmann jugs brought up from the ship for analysis bears the seal of the city of Amsterdam. Though most likely built in England by English shipwrights, it could have been contracted by Swedish or even Dutch owners. Analysis of a pistol found on the weather deck found that it bore close resemblance to a 1683 pistol model manufactured for the Swedish navy. The wood used for the pistol, though, is walnut, an expensive material in Sweden, making it less likely that it was part of a larger production series. Sj√∂historiska museet, Dalar√∂vraket . Retrieved 16 May 2009. The wreck lies with 17 degree list to starboard, and objects belonging to the ship that have been found on the sea floor have all been found on the starboard side. The current theory as to how the ship sank is that she was hit by a sudden squall in rough weather, heeled to starboard, took on water and then sank. The base of the windlass attached to the foredeck, a very sturdy construction, seems to have been torn off, which suggest the sinking happened suddenly. The presence of weapons and equipment on the weather deck supports the theory that the sinking occurred suddenly. No remains of the crew have been found. SVT, Vetenskapens V√§rld , \\"Tidskapsel\\", aired 6 April 2009. Design The lower masts of both fore- and mainmasts are still standing, whereas the mizzenmast have healed over to starboard. The wreck was originally rigged as a ship, with square sails on fore and mainmasts. The hull is about 20 m long and relatively wide. The stern is round tucked, which might indicate English shipbuilding style, rather than the Dutch. The hull has three gunports along each side. Two guns have been observed at the wrecksite. Due to its maneuverability and small size, such a ship would also have been suitable for piracy. The ship once had three masts, two of which are still standing. The beakhead was adorned with a figurehead in the shape of a lion. Archaeology The comparatively cold and brackish waters of the Baltic Sea are free from the \\"shipworm\\" Teredo navalis, which rapidly destroys submerged wood in most other seas. This means that the Baltic waters have an exceptional ability to conserve wrecks for hundreds of years, and has left the wooden construction of the Dalar√∂ wreck largely intact. As on the Vasa, metal objects such as bolts have rusted away, but the wooden construction itself remains largely intact.Cederlund & Hocker in Vasa I, pp. 172‚Äì180. The wreck has been the object of several investigations by marine archaeologists from Swedish National Maritime Museum, S√∂dert√∂rn University and the University of Southampton. Since the hull is intact and the sinking occurred suddenly, the wreck contains a multitude of objects that are interesting to archaeologists and historians. On the top deck there are several interesting finds, both ship equipment and other assorted items, including a musket. Two of the three masts are still standing, and the damaged windlass (used to winch up the anchor) can be clearly seen. There is an intact cabinet containing carpenter's tools, including an axe, a plane and an awl. Of the several cannon with which the ship was once armed only one remains, complete with its gun carriage. The hold has not been excavated and thoroughly examined, but in it are coal and a large quantity of stoneware Bartmann jugs, probably containing wine destined for the Swedish market. The divers who first located the wreck brought up the glass bottle that bore the crest of the English Boynton or Ogle families, a bowl, a drinking cup and one of the Bartmann jugs. Since the official announcement of the find in 2007, only two further objects have been brought up for analysis. One, the wooden butt of a flintlock pistol, helps date the find. The 1.9 meter-long lion figurehead lying next to the ship was also brought up and recorded in a 3D scanner. Both objects were then returned to their original positions on or near the wreck. Discovery and current status The wreck was discovered in 2003 by a group of professional divers, who notified the Swedish National Maritime Museums (SNMM) and showed some objects that were brought up from the wreck, but the find was not made public until 28 March 2007 through a press release from SNMM. Statens maritima museer, \\"1600-talsvrak funnet ‚Äì i b√§ttre skick √§n Vasa \\", 24 March 2007. Retrieved 16 May 2009. The wreck has not been moved from its current location and in order to preserve it, there are no plans to raise it, as was done with the warship Vasa in 1961. The difficulties in preserving the ship are considered by archaeologists to be too expensive and complicated. A salvage operation would also risk damaging the ship and the many related artefacts as well as disturb the site, making it more difficult to conduct further research. The SNMM in cooperation with Haninge Municipality intend to turn the site of the Dalar√∂ wreck into a wreck-diving park. The objective is to encourage cultural tourism by allowing the public access to the wreck site. Hobby divers are to be allowed to visit the wreck accompanied by licensed guides while non-divers are to be offered trips over the site that are to be enhanced by sonar and underwater cameras.Managing Cultural Heritage Underwater (MACHU), \\"Dive park project Sweden\\", 26 October 2008. Retrieved 16 May 2009. In May 2008 SNMM revealed that some time between October 2007 and April 2008 the Dalar√∂ wreck site had been disturbed. Some items had been removed while others had been disturbed or damaged. Statens maritima museer, \\"Skadeg√∂relse p√• Dalar√∂vraket, 9 May 2008. Retrieved May 2009. Among the objects that have disappeared so far is the wooden frame of a pistol that was located on the weather deck. The ship is monitored by the coast guard, and the residents of Dalar√∂ have been notified to be wary of attempts to plunder the wreck. As of 2009, objects recorded by archaeologists have disappeared and the wreck has been disturbed and to some extent damaged. Known wreck sites in the Baltic are inevitably plundered, and there have been public appeals to somehow protect the Dalar√∂ wreck. Though illegal, there is little preventing individuals from performing private covert diving operations in order to bring up objects from the ship in order to sell them on the black market. in 2017 the ship was identified as most likely being the Bodekull which sank in 1678.

The aim is to allow users to bring coded qualitative data from one software package to another. Initially support was included in Atlas.ti, QDA Miner, Quirkos and Transana, with implementation pledged from Dedoose, MAXQDA and NVivo. Although this was not the first standard to be proposed, it was the first to be implemented by more than one software package, and came as the result of a collaboration between vendors and community representatives from the research community. Previously there was very little capability to bring data in from other software packages. Pros and cons Such software helps to organize, manage and analyse information. The advantages of using this software include saving time, managing huge amounts of qualitative data, having increased flexibility, having improved validity and auditability of qualitative research, and being freed from manual and clerical tasks. Concerns include increasingly deterministic and rigid processes, privileging of coding, and retrieval methods; reification of data, increased pressure on researchers to focus on volume and breadth rather than on depth and meaning, time and energy spent learning to use computer packages, increased commercialism, and distraction from the real work of analysis.

He was a founding member of the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios, the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular and the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. In addition, he created murals and other monumental works in Mexico City and Guerrero. Life Arenal was born in 1909 in Teapa, Tabasco in southern Mexico. His family moved to Aguascalientes but when His father died fighting in the Mexican Revolution, he and his mother moved to Mexico City. He attended a parochial school until age 13, when he was expelled for reading gay literature. Arenal then studied mechanical engineering for two years, and then emigrated to Los Angeles in 1924 where he studied architecture while washing gasoline cans to get by. In 1926 he returned to Mexico and worked as a translator in an advertising office. From 1927 to 1928 he studied law as well as sculpture at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas. In 1929, he returned to the U.S. studying in California and working in restaurants. He began his art career exhibiting and painting murals in California then again returned to Mexico. Arenal was politically active promoting leftist causes and Communism. He went with Roberto Berdecio as a delegate to the first American Artists' Congress in New York in 1936. From 1940 to 1943 he traveled in South America . In 1946, he married Macrina Rabadan, a teacher, political leader and feminist, with whom he had two children. In 1940, he participated in Siqueiros' attack on Leon Trotsky's house in Coyoac√°n, which forced him to flee to the United States for a while. In addition to art, he also had architectural skills, which he mostly employed between 1945 and 1951, to build roads, houses and bridges in the state of Guerrero. He died on May 7, 1985 in Mexico City. Career Arenal's art career has included woodcut, lithography, painting and sculpting. It began in earnest in 1930, when he began exhibiting his work in Laguna Beach, Los Angeles, Redlands and San Bernardino. He had his first individual exhibition at the Plaza Art Center Gallery. When David Alfaro Siqueiros arrived to Los Angeles in 1932, he worked with him on the murals at the Chouinard Art School. This included a fresco on cement called \\"La Am√©rica Tropical.\\" During this time, he was also a member of a group called the Mural Block Painters along with Jean Abel, Jackson Pollock, Dean Cornwell and Radich. In 1933, he returned to Mexico where his work took a more political bent. He first became the general secretary of a group called the Mexican League Against War and Fascism. In 1934, he was a founding member and first secretary of the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios in 1933. He worked to create propaganda against war and fascism and supporting communism, founding the group's magazine Frente a Frente in 1935 along with Juan de la Cabada. In 1936, he went to New York for a political meeting and stayed until 1937, painting murals at Bellevue Hospital Center and exhibiting his work. When he returned in 1937, he founded the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular with Leopoldo M√©ndez and Pablo O'Higgins, taking part in all of the collective exhibitions of the organization. From 1937 through most of the 1940s, he did various murals and other monumental works. In 1939-40, he worked with Siqueiros on the murals \\"Retrato de la Burgues√≠a\\" at the Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas along with Josep Renau, Antonio Pujol, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Luna and Miguel Prieto . From 1944 to 1945 he created two sculptures, one in stone and the other in concrete to complement a Siqueiros mural at the Centro de Arte Moderno in Mexico City called Cuauht√©moc contra el mito. From 1946 to 1947 he worked on construction projects in the state of Guerrero. He also created a monument in Cuetzala del Progreso, Guerrero. In 1948, he created a mural on Masonite panels for a rural school in Arcelia, Guerrero. He painted the stairwell of the Guerrero state government palace from 1949 to 1952. In 1949 he founded a magazine called 1945-1946, acting as the head of writing and graphic design. That same year, he also created the engravings for a book called \\"Estampas de Guerrero.\\" He was a founding member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana . In 1955, he was one of the founders of the Instituto Regional de Bellas Artes in Acapulco. He collaborated with David Alfaro Siqueiros on the murals at the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros from 1964 to 1970. From 1972 to 1976 he created the Cabeza de Ju√°rez monument in Iztapalapa along with architect Lorenzo Carrasco, as his last major work. The piece is thirteen meters high and weighs almost three tons. This work was supposed to be painted by Siqueiros had he lived. Instead, Arenal and a team finished the work for Siqueiros, painting it in bright colors. Today, it has been converted into a museum. In 1977,he was named the director of the Siqueiros Workshop in Cuernavaca. Arenal Bastar died in 1985, leaving behind an unfinished sculpture of the director of the El D√≠a newspaper. Loved Art Artistry Arenal was one of the most important defenders of the realism with a social/political character promoted by Mexican muralism.

It holds the largest quantity of open-air Bronze Age petroglyphs in Europe, after Val Camonica in Italy, and is given special note for the area's inclusion for the European Diploma of Protected Areas.  Location  The valley is located near the Italian border, in the rugged mountains of the Argentera massif within the Maritime Alps, between Saint-Martin-V√©subie and Tende.  Petroglyphs  The petroglyphs (rock engravings), located on stone outcrops within the valley, were first identified by British amateur archaeologist Clarence Bicknell in 1881. Between 1897 and 1902, Bicknell copied and catalogued more than 10,000 drawings. Beginning in 1967, an extensive study of the petroglyphs was begun by French archaeologist Henry de Lumley. De Lumley and a team of his postgraduate students classified the petroglyphs in the 40 km¬≤ area, with the greatest concentration in a 14 km¬≤ archaeological site on the slope of Mount B√©go. the engravings display objects like daggers, axes, and scythes. Suns, stars and spirals are represented. Ovals with criss-crossed lines may represent land or the earth. Some anthropomorphic figures have been found. The most common drawings are of horned animals. Henry de Lumley has theorized the petroglyphs are the work of a Mediterranean Bronze Age people who worshipped the bull and for whom Mount B√©go was a sacred site.

They live in the Indigenous Park of the Xingu, located around the headwaters of the Xingu River in Mato Grosso. They currently reside in area around the Tuatuari and Kurisevo Rivers. They had a population of 254 in 2011, up slightly from 200 in 2002. Name The Mehinaku are also known as the Mehin√°ko, Meinaco, Meinacu, Meinaku, Mehin√°ku, Mahinaku, Mehinaco, and Minaco people. Language The Mehinaku speak the Mehin√°ku language, an Arawakan language.Gregor, The Mehinaku, p. 17. They also speak some Portuguese. A dialect of their language, Waur√°-kum√° is related to the Waur√° language. History Like many indigenous tribes, the Mehinaku do not keep detailed, chronological historical records going back more than a few generations. The oldest known village established by the Mehinaku was set up at some time around or before 1850, and was called Yulutakitsi. Because the community no longer exists, however, the exact location of its former site is unknown. According to the Mehinaku, historical villages were located along the Tuatuari river, north of the main Aweti village. The Mehinaku claim their older villages were much larger; which is likely because European explorers had not brought the diseases that indigenous people had no immunity to. These communities were likely abandoned for a variety of reasons, overused soil, intrusion of leaf-cutter ant colonies, and a tribal taboo associated with living in places where many people had died. In 1884, when the first German explorers arrived at the Xingu River headwaters and began to document the tribes living there, the Mehinaku had two villages and a camping site used only during the dry season. Many anthropologists believe that, at the time, the population of the region may have been more than four times what it is today, and that the villages were likely much larger. In the 1950s, the Ikpeng, a separate tribal group, invaded Mehinaku territory and drove them from it. During the invasion, the Mehinaku chief was called [?] by an arrow. Another tribe, the Yawalapiti, was forced to do the same. This tribal migration forced a political shift in the upper Xingu region. The Yawalapiti gave the Mehinaku one of their houses at a location called Jalapapuh, and Aweti agreed to divide territory along a trail between their village and the new Mehinaku center. For around a decade, the Mehinaku built communities around their new cultural center, until an outbreak of flu and measles killed around 15 people in the 1960s. After that, the Mehinaku relocated to a nearby area. The Mehinaku moved again in 1981, but did not go far from their original community. The proximity of a post where they could receive medical care gave them little incentive to relocate to their ancestral homeland, although the risks from the Ikpeng were gone by that time. Culture The Mehinaku have no provision for privacy in their social arrangements, and live with a striking degree of transparency. Huts that house families of ten or twelve people have no internal walls, and are situated around an open area that is in constant view.John L. Locke, Eavesdropping: An Intimate History (Oxford, 2010), p. 69. On the rare occasions when members of the group are out of sight, their activities can be inferred by their curious fellow villagers, who are able to recognize (and draw from memory) each other's footprints.Locke, Eavesdropping: An Intimate History, p. 70. Gregor sums up the situation by writing: \\"Each individual's whereabouts and activities are generally known to his relatives and often to the community as a whole. A Mehinaku has little chance of staying out of the public eye for any length of time.\\"Gregor, The Mehinaku, p. 67. Subsistence The Mehinaku hunt, fish, and farm to provide for themselves. Their primary crops are manioc and maize. Notes References  * Gregor, Thomas. The Mehinaku: The Drama of Daily Life in a Brazilian Indian Village. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980.

The limestone caves are open for the public to visit via guided tour. The entrance to the caverns used by modern visitors is located in a bluff along the Swatara Creek. A second entrance was sealed for security purposes when the caverns were commercialized in the late 1920s. The known portions of the caverns, most of which have been commercialized, represent the intersection of two passages: the \\"eastern\\" cavern and the \\"northern\\" cavern, which meet at right angles to form a large space known as the \\"Indian Ballroom.\\" Given the large and accessible natural openings the caverns were likely utilized by Native Americans for storage and shelter, however no evidence of such use has survived. The location was previously known as Wilson Cave, Hummelstown Cave, Stoverdale Cave, Giant's Cave, and Indian Cave. When it was commercialized it was renamed Indian Echo Cave. It has more recently been known as Indian Echo Caverns. For nineteen years (1802‚Äì1821) the caverns were the home of William Wilson, known as the Pennsylvania Hermit. Wilson withdrew from society after his failure to halt the execution of his sister Elizabeth for the murder of her twin sons. Following her death in Chester, Pennsylvania in 1786, William wandered westward across southeastern Pennsylvania, settling in the caverns in 1802. The Sweets of Solitude: Instructions to Mankind How They May Be Happy in a Miserable World, an essay supposedly written by Wilson during his time in the caverns, was published following his death. The same geological system of which the caverns are a part is responsible for many sinkholes in an area stretching from Hummelstown to as far as Palmyra, and as far south as Middletown.

FC Magdeburg and its predecessors. After his career he became a sports functionary in East German football and later in the unified Germany. Playing career Moldenhauer's career began in 1954 at BSG Motor Mitte Magdeburg, the football department of which formed a section of SC Aufbau and later became 1. FC Magdeburg during Moldenhauer's playing days. Aged 12, Moldenhauer played as a midfielder, but when the Handball section tried to persuade him to switch sports, teammates suggested he try his hand at goalkeeping, and Moldenhauer showed his real potential. After Moldenhauer had joined the juniors team of SC Aufbau, officials of the East German national team took notice of his consistently good performances, and on 27 March 1960 Moldenhauer played his first match for the East German youth national team. He stood in goal in the next four matches, and played six times for the youth national team altogether. Aside from his footballing career, Moldenhauer passed the abitur and studied mechanical engineering at Magdeburg's Technische Hochschule. He later earned a doctorate degree and worked in one Magdeburg's heavy engineering companies. Aged 18 Moldenhauer appeared in his first DDR- Oberliga match on 2 July 1960, when SC Aufbau Magdeburg lost 0-1 to SC Einheit Dresden. However, he remained the back-up goalkeeper behind East German international Wolfgang Blochwitz. Only after Blochwitz had left for FC Carl Zeiss Jena when Magdeburg were relegated in 1966 did Moldenhauer become the regular keeper. But Moldenhauer won his first title already in 1964 when he played in the 3‚Äì2 FDGB-Pokal final win against SC Leipzig. Five years later he won his second cup final when Magdeburg beat FC Karl-Marx-Stadt 4‚Äì0 in 1969. By winning the cup, Moldenhauer gained the chance to play in the European Cup Winners' Cup, but due to injuries he missed the first matches of the 1969-70 season and first played in the 2nd round against Portuguese side Academica Coimbra. After a 1‚Äì2 aggregate loss Magdeburg were eliminated from the competition. In the meantime, Moldenhauer faced internal competition in the club in young goalkeeper Ulrich Schulze, eventually losing his status as first-choice goalkeeper in the 1970-71 season As he had already turned 30, Moldenhauer stepped down from 1. FC Magdeburg's Oberliga squad at the end of the 1970-71 season. In his twelve years in the first team of the Magdeburg club, Moldenhauer played in 152 competitive matches, 134 in the Oberliga, 16 in the FDGB-Pokal and two matches in the Cup Winners' Cup. Career as a sports functionary Aside from his age, work-related issues were decisive in Moldenhauer's ending his playing career. Moldenhauer had received an offer from Magdeburg's SKET, a producer of heavy machinery, to work in a senior position there. He nevertheless stayed a 1. FC Magdeburg member and became part-time goalkeeping coach at the club in 1975. Later he was elected to the club's board of directors. When the question of the future of the East German Football Association (DFV) came up during the events of Die Wende, Moldenhauer belonged to those pushing for a quick absorption into the German Football Association (DFB). On 31 March 1990 Moldenhauer was elected President of the DFV and initiated the merger with the DFB that was completed on 20 November 1990. Moldenhauer was then elected vice-president of the DFB and took on responsibility for the education of coaches and the promotion of talent. In this context he became chairman of the Verein responsible for the Bundesleistungszentrum in Kienbaum near Berlin. Additionally he became president of the newly created Nordostdeutscher Fu√üballverband (NOFV). From 1994 to 2006 he was also vice-president of the Deutscher Sportbund. In 1991 Moldenhauer founded SV Oldies Magdeburg, a sports club he himself stays fit in and occasionally plays football matches.

The team collaborates with customers who have innovative technological solutions and helps them implement those solutions in real-life scenarios. During its existence jStart has collaborated with a wide range of different companies including corporates and small businesses. The team has achieved different types of technology including big data, text analytics, natural language processing, machine learning, and IBM Watson. History  jStart was founded as a vehicle to engage and validate Java technology with customers/clients. In 1999 it broadened its mission to cover the much wider concept of ‚Äúemerging internet technologies‚Äù. Timeline of technologies jStart has been involved in: * 1997: Java - promoted and championed Java to large enterprise environments * 1999: Beyond Java - evolved from that evangelism mission to introduce new and emerging internet techs into IBM and to IBM's customers/clients by validating emerging technologies with a client engagement model. * 2001: S.O.A., XML * 2004: Web Services * 2006: Web 2.0 in the Enterprise (\\"Web 2.0 Goes to Work\\") * 2007: RIA (Rich Internet Applications) * 2009: Mashup Technologies * 2010: Big Data/Very large data analytics, cross- platform mobile development * 2011: Watson commercialization, DeepQA, machine learning * 2012: Social Analytics, big data analytics applied to social data * 2013: IBM Bluemix, a next-gen XaaS cloud platform What differentiates the team from other IBM groups is how jStart validates emerging technologies: it is the primary engagement vehicle for IBM to validate emerging technologies while those technologies are in their emergent stage for enterprise business environments. Because of this, jStart was the first to introduce these technologies into large Fortune 500 IT infrastructures as well as smaller SMB environments by addressing existing business needs (rather than theoretical R&D; business scenarios). The team is working to commercialize IBM's Watson system and is a proponent of cloud offerings.  Water Mission collaboration  In 2016 IBM jStart partnered with Water Mission with a purpose to advance the technology and to provide clean and safe water to numerous communities worldwide. Both teams are set to work on three major projects. One of them includes creating a dashboard that would provide real-time data alerts and analysis for the global operations that include over 2,000 current and all of the potential safe water systems. The goal of the system is to enable making more strategic decisions and to assess the financial state and performance of every system. Another project includes the creation of an Early Warning System. The purpose of the system will be to analyze the trends and patterns that can cause drought and water-related issues in East Africa. The final project is advising which will be provided by jStart on Water Mission's Research and Development team regarding the \\"programmable logic controllers (PLCs) on new membrane filtration systems that could potentially be used to redesign the original safe water treatment system.\\" About jStart The jStart team has developed a model in which customer engagements drive its exploration of emerging technologies. It does this by engaging hundreds of clients per year to validate emerging technology priorities (using a client- driven development model instead of a research-driven model). jStart has used this model for each of the technologies it has helped to launch and/or develop. A number of technologies the team has worked with have gone on to graduate into open source projects, have become IBM products, or have been licensed to third parties. Other, less successful technologies, were discontinued when it was determined that, based on client/customer engagements, those technologies were not applicable to enterprise environments.\\"The jStart Process: Start Small, Grow Fast\\", IBM's jStart Website: Process, accessed February 1, 2011.

This occurred between 1941 and 1944 when Cork won the championship title every year. Only nine men played in all four finals, hence the record of the nine. These men were Din Joe Buckley, Alan Lotty, Jack Lynch, Willie Murphy, Paddy O'Donovan, Johnny Quirke, Christy Ring, Batt Thornhill and Dr. Jim Young. Their record stood for 65 years in spite of some close calls in the interim. In 1952 Tipperary had won the three previous All-Ireland titles and looked set for a fourth consecutive triumph. They were eventually defeated by Cork in the Munster final that year. In 1979 Cork had also won the three previous All-Ireland titles. Their four-in-a-row dream came to a halt in the All-Ireland semi-final following a shock defeat by Galway. One of the nine, Jack Lynch was also on the Cork football team that captured the 1945 All-Ireland Football Title. When Cork regained the All- Ireland Hurling title in 1946 Lynch gained his sixth All-Ireland medal in successive years (5 in hurling,1 in football), a unique achievement in Gaelic games. In 2009 Kilkenny equalled the record when they secured their own four- in-a-row of All-Ireland titles. On that occasion Michael Kavanagh, Henry Shefflin, Tommy Walsh, Jackie Tyrrell, Derek Lyng, Eoin Larkin, Eddie Brennan, Aidan Fogarty and Martin Comerford joined a unique club of hurlers who won four consecutive All-Ireland titles.

Jhansi Ki Rani ( Story of a brave woman...Queen of Jhansi) is an Indian historical drama based on the life of Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi. The series was directed by Jitendra Srivastava and written by Rajesh Saksham, Ila Dutta Bedi, Malavika Asthana, Mairaj Zaidi and Virendra Singh Patyal. It premiered on 18 August 2009 on Zee TV with Ulka Gupta playing Queen Lakshmi Bai. On 8 June 2010, the story moved on several years and Kratika Sengar portrayed the Queen from there on. The last show episode aired on 19 June 2011. Plot Jhansi Ki Rani begins with Manikarnika (Manu) at age 14. She lives with her father, Moropant Tambe, a pandit in the Bithoor court of Peshwa Baji Rao II and Nana Saheb. Manu is trained in the arts of war by Tatya Tope. She despises the British rule of India, and takes the form of Kranti Guru to combat it. Manu is a thorn in the side of Manson, a British official. She marries king of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. The court of Jhansi is headed by Raghunath Singh and Narsingh Rao. Her name changes to Lakshmi Bai, and her life changes drastically. At Jhansi a servant, Moti Bai, collaborates with British officer Captain Fraser but changes sides after meeting Rani. Another officer, Marshal, kills Prachi (Bajirao's little daughter) and is killed by Kranti Guru in revenge. When the maharaja discovers that Kranti Guru is Rani, their relationship deteriorates. He agrees with a British officer that Kranti Guru will not be accused of Marshal's death if he hands over Rani's friend, Samar Singh. When Rani saves Samar, the maharaja casts her away. When Rani sees the British mistreating villagers outside Jhansi, she persuades them to fight. She finds Samar Singh (who helps her) and Karma (who wants to kill the maharaja). Captain Martin promises Karma the leadership of the villages if he works for them, but he then betrays him. Rani saves Karma, who becomes an ally. Martin challenges Rani (disguised as a man, Raja) to fight against a madman; Raja wins the fight, but is then revealed as Rani. The maharaja takes her back as the maharani; Martin retires, and is replaced by Captains Malcom and Ross. After several failed attempts to kill the maharaja, Captain Nelson kills Ross; Samar Singh is framed for the murder and hanged. Rani visits Baji Rao, who is severely ill in Bithoor; he dies while Manson tries to conquer Bithoor Fort. Rani fights victoriously, and cuts off Manson's leg. She gives birth to Damodar Rao, and adopts Anand Rao. Nelson kills Damodar, Ali Bahadur kills the maharaja and Captain Hamilton is sent to Jhansi to subdue it. Rani renames Anand Damodar and wages war against the East India Company against the backdrop of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Hamilton pits Jhansi and the city of Orchha against each other; Orchha's queen, Ladai Sarkar, is sympathetic to the British and holds a grudge against Jhansi. Ladai Sarkar captures Tatya Tope, Raghunath Singh and Gauss Khan but Rani Lakshmi Bai frees them all and wins the battle. The victorious Rani returns to a conquered Jhansi, which she reclaims after threatening the life of the 1st Earl of Dalhouise. Nelson frames her for the death of the king of Mot, and when Ladai Sarkar (the king's sister-in-law) captures Rani he betrays Sarkar. The queens become allies in prison, and after Rani escapes she kills Nelson. Queen Victoria sends General Hugh Henry Rose, who helps Hamilton capture Prince Damodar, as a replacement. After Rani saves her son's life she kills Hamilton; Hugh Rose's army attacks Jhansi Fort, where many of her loyal followers and allies including Guass Khan, Karma, Moropant Tambe, Jhalkaribai, Ladai Sarkar and Kashi die. Bithoor is conquered while Nana Saheb flees to Nepal. Before the Final Battle Tatya Tope brings his army for Rani Laxmibai's aid. Rani Laxmibai leaves her fort and goes to Gwalior along with her army . In Gwalior she fights her final battle where she is betrayed by the Prime Minister of Gwallior. In the final battle, Raghunath Singh in an attempt to divert the Britishers is shot dead. During the course of battle, Rani Laxmibai gets severely injured as British general stabs sword in her stomach multiple times. Later she also gets shot in the stomach. She also gets deeply wounded on her head. She hands over Damodar Rao to Tatya Tope and tells him to safeguard the prince before taking on the Britishers for one final time. Moments before her death she tells a villager to burn her body so that the British couldn't touch it.

ReceptionHistorical accuracy= The drama was praised for the historical accuracy of the dresses and ornaments worn by the characters. However, doubts were raised on the authenticity of \\"Ek Veer Stree Ki Kahani... Jhansi Ki Rani\\" by some historians. Jhansi-based historian Professor Jawaharlal Kanchan protested that the drama is playing with history and providing incorrect information to young minds. The bone of contention for Prof Kanchan is an episode which shows Rani Laxmi Bai wounded by enemy soldiers while on a visit to a hilltop temple in Jhansi. \\"And despite being hurt she visits the temple. But there is no historical evidence of such an incident and neither is there any such hilltop temple in Jhansi,\\" he points out. Dr A. K. Pandey, director, State Museum, Jhansi states, \\"makers of the serial should understand that they cannot distort historical facts just for the sake of TRPs.\\" =Reactions from orthodox viewers= Certain reactions from orthodox Indian viewers and historians were negative. The director of the State Museum (Dr A. K. Pandey) at Jhansi states, \\"Rani Lakshmi Bai is like a goddess to us and seeing her story presented in a distorted manner is painful. Showing intimate bedroom scenes of Jhansi ki Rani is also unacceptable.\\" Dharmesh Shah, the director of the drama defends the protests by pointing out, \\"The British ruled that any kingdom without an heir would be annexed by the East India Company. So Rani Laxmi Bai wanted an heir, because of which we were required to show those intimate scenes. There is no need of creating a hullabaloo.\\" =Ratings= Soon after launch, it became one of the most watched Hindi GEC.

Life Werner Karl Dahm was born on Feb. 16, 1917 in Lindenthal near K√∂ln, Germany, the son of Anton Dahm and Maria Morkramer. The family moved to Bonn later that year. His father was the first engineer in a long line of merchants. After graduating from the Beethoven School in Bonn in 1936, he studied aerodynamics and aircraft design at the Technical University in Aachen, and later in Munich when the Nazis had closed other technical universities. In Munich he was one of just four students, out of several hundred, who refused to join the Nazi student club. He said he first simply pretended not to find it, and then since it was formally listed as a dueling club he avoided it by claiming religious objections. For this he was denied access to certain advanced aircraft courses, so he focused on courses relevant to rocketry. Before completing his degree he was drafted at the end of 1939, and sent with a signal corps unit to France and then to Czechoslovakia. In between, he was granted a one-semester break to complete the major part of his aerodynamics degree. As a result of his technical background, in late 1941 he was assigned to the German rocket development effort at Peenem√ºnde, led by Wernher von Braun. There, as the youngest member of the rocket team, he worked in the future projects division, a group composed mainly of physicists who needed a specialist in aerodynamics. At the time, theoretical understanding of high-speed aerodynamics was still in its infancy. He was one of a group that conducted pioneering experiments in a small supersonic wind tunnel to obtain essential insights and data to support designs for proposed new rockets. Among these was the A9/A10 rocket, designed to be the first intercontinental ballistic missile, based on a Mach 6 boost- glide approach using a winged derivative of the V2 rocket. He soon recognized in the wind tunnel results that a shift occurred in the aerodynamic center-of- pressure as the rocket transitioned to supersonic speeds, which would cause it to become unstable. This led to experiments and theories to understand the shift and determine aerodynamic configurations that would allow the rocket to remain stable. He also worked on the Wasserfall rocket, a radar-guided supersonic anti-aircraft missile, in which the same center-of-pressure shift was being encountered. Along the way, he developed a conical rocket propellant tank that successfully overcame liquid fuel sloshing problems, for which he won an internal prize with a monetary award that he proudly never cashed. In August 1943, when Allied forces bombed the Peenemuende facilities, he received a commendation for saving critical wind tunnel data during the ensuing fires. The Wasserfall project continued almost to the war's end, and the rocket was successfully flown but never went into production. In 1944, he and others in the group were granted civilian status, and resumed the A9/A10 development effort. In January 1945, near the end of the war, two A9 test rockets were launched with control surface designs based on the group's solution to the center-of-pressure shift. The second of these achieved stable transition to supersonic flight. Facing advancing Russian forces at the beginning of February 1945, he and most others on the rocket team moved to Oberammergau to allow a surrender to American forces. After his release in August 1945, he briefly worked in a candle factory of family friends in Bonn, until accepting an invitation from the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip to join the U.S. Army's nascent rocket program with other members selected from von Braun's team. He insisted, however, on first being allowed to finish his degree, which was officially awarded in mechanical engineering due to postwar restrictions on further rocket work in Germany. In August 1947 he rejoined the other scientists from the von Braun team at Fort Bliss, Texas to begin work on the U.S. rocket program. In the U.S. he was initially involved in tests at White Sands Missile Range using V2 rockets. These results led directly to the Redstone rocket and laid the basis for every other rocket developed in the United States since. The White Sands work included a Mach 3 cruise missile known as the Hermes II, based on a V2 first stage with a radical linear ramjet concept for the second stage. His work on the Hermes II continued after he moved in 1950 with much of the von Braun team to Huntsville, Ala. as part of the Army's ballistic missile program. There he developed the external aerodynamic design for the Army's Redstone missile, which served as the launch rocket for the nation's first live nuclear missile tests and later also launched the first U.S. astronaut into space. He developed a successful Mach 5 ballistic re-entry nose cone using a purely theoretical approach, at a time when no hypersonic wind tunnels existed to test the theories or provide needed data. He subsequently continued pioneering contributions in high-speed aerothermochemistry in the Army's Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile program, and then on the Army's Pershing medium-range ballistic missile and the large Saturn I booster rocket. Following the Russian Sputnik launch, in July 1960 he moved with other von Braun rocket scientists from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency to the newly founded NASA. There, as part of the Apollo moon-landing program, he made major contributions working on the Saturn V booster rocket, on aerothermodynamics, and on liquid hydrogen propellant systems. He subsequently was involved in numerous projects contributing to the nation's manned and unmanned space flight programs, especially Skylab and the Space Shuttle. In the Shuttle development effort he led a team working on vehicle aerodynamics and the main engines, which included developing full- scale component tests and scaling methodologies, and applying computational fluid dynamics to overcome a wide range of aerothermochemistry problems. He was Chief of the Aerophysics Division at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center until 1992, when he became Chief Aerodynamicist at the NASA Center. He was awarded the AIAA Aerodynamics Award in 1997 for his exceptional lifetime contributions to the aerodynamic design and analysis of strategic missiles and manned/unmanned launch rockets, and received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 2003. He continued working in science positions at NASA until his retirement, at 89, in 2006. David King, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, said \\"America's space program is preeminent because folks like Mr. Dahm contributed to building it into the best in the world. His life and life's work are an example of his energy, dedication and humble leadership, which has played a significant role in humanity's peaceful use of space.\\" Publications *  References  External links  * Category:1917 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Scientists from Cologne Category:Early spaceflight scientists Category:German aerospace engineers Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:German military personnel of World War II Category:German rocket scientists Category:Technical University of Munich alumni Category:People from the Rhine Province Category:Operation Paperclip Category:Engineers from North Rhine-Westphalia ","title":"Werner Dahm"},{"id":"22824014","text":":For his son, see Henry Cust.

Douglas's design, the P3D, was designed in parallel with the smaller YB-11 being developed for the United States Army Air Corps (which was eventually built as the YOA-5), and like the YB-11, was a twin-engined high- winged monoplane with its engines (the new Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp radial engine mounted in nacelles above and ahead of the wing.

The Douglas prototype, designated XP3D-1, first flew on 6 February 1935, and was delivered to NAS San Diego for testing in March 1935. Both the XP3D-1 and Consolidated's P3Y successfully passed the Navy's performance tests,Creed 1986, pp.32‚Äì33. demonstrated very similar performance, an order was placed for 60 P3Ys (re-designated PBY in May 1936) because the Consolidated aircraft was cheaper, costing $90,000 per aircraft compared with $110,000 for the Douglas aircraft.Francillon 1979, pp.194‚Äì195. Douglas re-designed the P3D to improve performance in order to win follow-on contracts, and rebuilt the XP3D-1, raising the wing by 27 inches (0.69 m) and mounting the engines on the leading edge of the wing. The fixed wing floats were replaced by retractable floats, and a nose turret was fitted. The rebuilt aircraft, designated XP3D-2 was re-delivered on 15 May 1935, but production orders again went to Consolidated, for the improved PBY-2.Francillon 1979, p.195. Operational history The aircraft after rebuilding as the XP3D-2 The XP3D-1 was briefly operated by Patrol Squadron 3 (VP-3) until it was returned to Douglas for re-building. The re-built XP3D-2 was used by VP-11F as an VIP aircraft until destroyed in a crash at Acapulco Bay, Mexico on 8 February 1937. The crash was survived by the embarked VIP, Rear Admiral Ernest King.

The most common such statistics are the interquartile range (IQR) and the median absolute deviation (MAD). These are contrasted with conventional measures of scale, such as sample variance or sample standard deviation, which are non-robust, meaning greatly influenced by outliers. These robust statistics are particularly used as estimators of a scale parameter, and have the advantages of both robustness and superior efficiency on contaminated data, at the cost of inferior efficiency on clean data from distributions such as the normal distribution. To illustrate robustness, the standard deviation can be made arbitrarily large by increasing exactly one observation (it has a breakdown point of 0, as it can be contaminated by a single point), a defect that is not shared by robust statistics.  IQR and MAD  One of the most common robust measures of scale is the interquartile range (IQR), the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of a sample; this is the 25% trimmed range, an example of an L-estimator. Other trimmed ranges, such as the interdecile range (10% trimmed range) can also be used. Another familiar robust measure of scale is the median absolute deviation (MAD), the median of the absolute values of the differences between the data values and the overall median of the data set; for a Gaussian distribution, MAD is related to \\\\sigma as \\\\sigma \\\\approx 1.4826\\\\ \\\\operatorname{MAD} (the derivation can be found here).  Estimation  Robust measures of scale can be used as estimators of properties of the population, either for parameter estimation or as estimators of their own expected value. For example, robust estimators of scale are used to estimate the population variance or population standard deviation, generally by multiplying by a scale factor to make it an unbiased consistent estimator; see scale parameter: estimation. For example, dividing the IQR by 2 erf‚àí1(1/2) (approximately 1.349), makes it an unbiased, consistent estimator for the population standard deviation if the data follow a normal distribution. In other situations, it makes more sense to think of a robust measure of scale as an estimator of its own expected value, interpreted as an alternative to the population variance or standard deviation as a measure of scale. For example, the MAD of a sample from a standard Cauchy distribution is an estimator of the population MAD, which in this case is 1, whereas the population variance does not exist. Efficiency These robust estimators typically have inferior statistical efficiency compared to conventional estimators for data drawn from a distribution without outliers (such as a normal distribution), but have superior efficiency for data drawn from a mixture distribution or from a heavy-tailed distribution, for which non-robust measures such as the standard deviation should not be used. For example, for data drawn from the normal distribution, the MAD is 37% as efficient as the sample standard deviation, while the Rousseeuw‚ÄìCroux estimator Qn is 88% as efficient as the sample standard deviation.  Absolute pairwise differences  Rousseeuw and Croux propose alternatives to the MAD, motivated by two weaknesses of it: # It is inefficient (37% efficiency) at Gaussian distributions. # it computes a symmetric statistic about a location estimate, thus not dealing with skewness. They propose two alternative statistics based on pairwise differences: Sn and Qn, defined as: : \\\\begin{align} S_n &:= 1.1926 \\\\, \\\\operatorname{med}_i \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{med}_j (\\\\,\\\\left x_i - x_j \\\\right\\\\,) \\\\right) , Q_n & := c_n \\\\text{first quartile of} \\\\left( \\\\left x_i - x_j \\\\right : i < j \\\\right), \\\\end{align} where c_n is a constant depending on n. These can be computed in O(n log n) time and O(n) space. Neither of these requires location estimation, as they are based only on differences between values. They are both more efficient than the MAD under a Gaussian distribution: Sn is 58% efficient, while Qn is 82% efficient. For a sample from a normal distribution, Sn is approximately unbiased for the population standard deviation even down to very modest sample sizes (<1% bias for n = 10). For a large sample from a normal distribution, 2.219144465985075864722Qn is approximately unbiased for the population standard deviation. For small or moderate samples, the expected value of Qn under a normal distribution depends markedly on the sample size, so finite-sample correction factors (obtained from a table or from simulations) are used to calibrate the scale of Qn.  The biweight midvariance  Like Sn and Qn, the biweight midvariance aims to be robust without sacrificing too much efficiency. It is defined as : \\\\frac{n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-Q)^2(1-u_i^2)^4 I(u_i<1)}{\\\\left(\\\\sum_i(1-u_i^2)(1-5u_i^2)I(u_i<1)\\\\right)^2} , where I is the indicator function, Q is the sample median of the Xi, and : u_i = \\\\frac{x_i-Q}{9\\\\cdot{\\\\rm MAD}}. Its square root is a robust estimator of scale, since data points are downweighted as their distance from the median increases, with points more than 9 MAD units from the median having no influence at all. Extensions propose a robust depth-based estimator for location and scale simultaneously..

The transmission consisted of a continuously looping recording of bird song. It was available via the Digital One DAB network. The recording is also available via the Digital One website until Autumn 2009 and the RadioBirdsong website. Originally starting out as a test signal on analogue radio in 1992 and then later broadcast on digital radio from 2003 to 2005, the channel gained regular listeners, who complained when it was taken off-air. In 2008-2009, the broadcast again existed as a 'filler' transmission until a commercially operated radio station, Amazing Radio, replaced it on 1 June 2009. On 27 December 2019, the channel returned to digital radio once again, but in the Portsmouth area. Overview When financial news station Bloomberg and rolling news station ITN News Radio ceased to broadcast within several months of one another in 2003, replacement audio services were never found due to a commitment in Digital One's broadcasting licence to provide a news station. This resulted in a station playing a 36-minute, 56-second loop of birdsong and ambient sounds, entitled 'D1 Temp' which broadcast for almost two years. In June 2005, the capacity formerly used by the speech services, and later by the birdsong, was given over to a test transmission of video to mobile phones known as BT Movio. When the magazine-format digital radio station Oneword ceased in January 2008, the birdsong audio once again returned to the multiplex on the Oneword channel and the service name of the DAB channel changed to \\"Birdsong\\". The recording The dawn birdsong was recorded in autumn of 1991, on the edge of Salisbury Plain in the Wiltshire garden of Quentin Howard, the chairman of Digital One. The tape was originally made for an amateur dramatics production of When the Wind Blows by Raymond Briggs, which was in need of countryside sound effects, and was first heard on-air during test transmissions between July and September 1992 prior to the launch of Classic FM. It has featured in a number of TV and radio reports including Countryfile in 2008 and on BBC Breakfast TV.BBC Breakfast TV video report http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7330000/newsid_7335900/7335977.stm?bw=bb‚àì=wm&asb;=1&news;=1&bbcws;=1 Reception Some listeners have found the recording a relaxing alternative to other stations. However, other listeners have been annoyed by the sounds of crows crowing and gunshot-like sounds of wood cracking, as it expands in the morning sun. Several myths have appeared about some of the sounds heard in the recording, which are explained on the Radio Birdsong website.Radio Birdsong Story http://www.radiobirdsong.com/page003.html One listener was able to identify at least twelve distinct species of bird in the recording. Listeners complained when transmission ceased in 2005. In 2008, the transmission was reported in the press as gaining more attention than the spoken-word programming of Oneword, and even of attracting half a million listeners. Closure In 2009, Glyn Jones, acting chief executive of Digital One stated that \\"Birdsong has been more popular with journalists than real listeners\\", pointing out that there was never any real evidence for the figure of half a million listeners. Quentin Howard was quoted in several newspaper articles, including The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jun/02/birdsong- radio-channel The Guardian. 2009-06-02 that he did not know why \\"the birds have been killed\\", but he suspected it might be to create publicity for the new channel.\\" Birdsong was removed from the Digital One multiplex at 23:59:59 on Sunday 31 May 2009 to allow for the launch of Amazing Radio. The original birdsong recording used by Classic FM and Digital One continues to be available on-line via the Digital One website and from the official Radio Birdsong website. Birdsong Radio made a temporary return to digital radio in January 2014 after Jazz FM ceased broadcasting on the Digital One platform, before LBC began airing nationally from 11 February. Reprieve Without prior notice Birdsong returned to digital radio on 27 December 2019 on the Portsmouth small scale DAB multiplex as a DAB+ service. On 1st April 2020 Birdsong was also added to the Glasgow small scale multiplex. Birdsong +1 From 27 December 2019 to 17 February 2020, Birdsong +1 was broadcast on the Portsmouth small scale DAB multiplex.

His movement had a commune based in Besut, Terengganu, which was demolished by the Malaysian government in August 2005. He claimed to have direct contact with the heavens and was believed by his followers to be the reincarnation of Jesus, Buddha, Shiva, and Muhammad. Devotees of Sky Kingdom believe that one day, Ayah Pin will return as the Imam Mahdi. His followers considered him the king of the sky, and the supreme object of devotion for all religions. Ayah Pin is also said to be practising black magic spell that enabling someone to bowed over him. Personal life Ayah Pin with his 4 wives Ayah Pin was born as Ariffin bin Mohammed on 22 June 1941 into a Muslim Malay family in Beris Kubor Besar, Bachok, Kelantan. His parents are Mohammed Merah and Saadiah Yaacob, both of whom were menial workers. Abdul Rahman was his younger brother. Ayah Pin was illiterate and he attended primary school until Year 2. He was also involved in small part-time business, eventually working in scrap iron and buffalo trading, and even worked as a sub- contractor. He had four marriages and twenty one children. Ayah Pin's first wife, Che Minah Ramli died in 2012; he later married an 18-year-old woman. After remarried, Ayah Pin suffers from stroke. Spiritual career In 1953, Ayah Pin became seriously ill and he alleged that an angel visited him. Twenty years later, the angel returned and he began his spiritual career. Whether Ayah Pin was the founder is unclear; during this phase he may have been a follower of Hassan Ya'acob (also known as Anak Rimau), apparently another claimant to divinity. After Hassan died, Ayah Pin and his four wives developed the Sky Kingdom teachings. His wives also the followers of the cult, since then Ayah Pin managed to gather many of his followers. Among of his deviant teachings are doomsday will not happened and Ayah Pin allegedly would become the Prime Minister in the afterlife. Around the mid-1980s, the Sky Kingdom commune was formed on its present site in Besut. Some reports state that the office of Islamic Affairs declared the group to be deviant at this time. In 1995, Sky Kingdom's signature building projects began, as per divine revelation. Two years later, Local Religious Affairs council (Jawatankuasa Fatwa Majlis Agama Islam dan Adat Melayu Terengganu) issued a fatwa against the group. Around this time, four adherents were arrested for renouncing Islam, but they were later freed on grounds that as ex-Muslims Malaysia's sharia court no longer enjoys jurisdiction over them. In 2001, Ayah Pin renounced Islam. The Sharia court accused him of contravening Section 25 of the Enakmen Pentadbiran Hal Ehwal Agama Islam 1986 (Administration of Islamic Religious Affairs 1986), stating that his teachings and beliefs were false, deviant, corrupting and threatening to the public peace (membawa ancaman kepada ketenteraman orang awam serta merosakkan akidah). He pleaded guilty to the charge of \\"belittling Islam\\" (menghina Islam), and was jailed for 11 months and fined RM 2,900. The Religious Affairs Office hoped that Ayah Pin's arrest would prevent the movement's growth, however Sky Kingdom continued to attract new followers from among university students and Orang Asli. On 18 July 2005, a group of masked vigilantes vandalised the group's headquarters, smashing windows and torching buildings. Two days later, 58 followers were arrested, and on 31 July three of Ayah Pin's four wives were also arrested in Kelantan. Ayah Pin escaped arrest and became a fugitive wanted by the Malaysian authorities. Forty-five members face charges of failing to observe the government fatwa (i.e. for continuing to be members of a sect declared as deviant), which carries a fine up to RM 3,000 or two years in prison. One of those arrested faced an additional charge of \\"humiliating Islam\\". Court cases promise to revolve around the issue of religious freedom, which is theoretically guaranteed by the Malaysian constitution. On 1 August 2005, officials of the Besut Land and District Office destroyed Sky Kingdom's various buildings, citing Section 129 of the National Land Code (which punishes unauthorised construction with land confiscation). The titular landowner is Ayah Pin's first wife, who apparently failed to appear in court for a hearing on the matter. On 1 September 2005, at a hearing, a trial date for 45 followers accused of violating the government fatwa was set for three days beginning 18 December that year. All of the accused were represented by Wan Haidi Wan Jusoh of Ubaidullah Aziz and Co, who unsuccessfully petitioned the court to order his name blacked out by the media. The group had previously experienced great difficulty in attracting legal representation, presumably owing to attorneys' fear of reprisals or negative publicity. As of 2007, after wide media coverage, the original Hulu Besut commune, now down to 24 members, had reportedly chosen a new leader, who turned out to be a former police chief inspector in his 30s. The group is suspicious of visitors, and routinely turns off the commune's lights whenever a car approaches at night, in order to conceal themselves. From 2009 onwards, Ayah Pin was believed to have been residing in exile in Narathiwat, Thailand, past border from Kelantan. Death On 22 April 2016, Ayah Pin died in the home of his third wife, Che Jaharah Awang in Kampung Batu 13, Hulu Besut due to natural causes. He was 74 years old. Before his death, it was reported that he had been suffering from various illnesses since fleeing from the authorities in 2005. His body was laid to rest at Batu 13 Cemetery, Hulu Besut, Kuala Terengganu.

Born in 1930, he was the second eldest in a family of ten brothers and sisters and grew up in the Fillmore district of San Francisco. A community character, he was instrumental in the political fight against the city to stop the demolition of the International Hotel on Kearny Street. He was also a prominent member of the San Francisco-based Asian American writers' collective Kearny Street Workshop. Al Robles combined heritage with experience. His poetry and community work honored Filipino elders (Manongs) and also inspired and encouraged the young students, activists, writers and artists to connect to their Filipino heritage. Verses about traditional Filipino foods, his experiences in Hawaii, New Mexico, and community personalities in San Francisco resulted in countless poems, and two published works: \\"Looking for Ifugao Mountain: Paghahanap Sa Bundok Ng Ifugao and Rappin' with Ten Thousand Carabaos in the Dark.

It was founded by the Vering & Waechter railway construction and operating company, the firm of Doertenbach & Co and the Central German Credit Bank (Mitteldeutsche Creditbank).  Acquisition of branch lines  The DEBG immediately took over from Vering & Waechter the running powers for twelve branch lines with a total length of 184 km. These included seven railways of foreign owners in all parts of the German Reich, however these were given up again in the years that followed. One of them was the narrow gauge Gernrode-Harzgerode Railway in the Harz mountains. The remaining five were transferred to the DEBG in 1898/99; four of them were in the Grand Duchy of Baden. After the turn of the century the centre of gravity for the business was now clearly in the southwestern part of the Empire. The DEBG built another four railways in Baden and three in Alsace- Lorraine, the latter being lost again in 1919/20 after the First World War. The loss of the lines in Alsace-Lorraine was balanced out by the procurement of five railways from the Badischen Lokal-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (BLEAG) on 22 December 1931. This expansion added 131 km of line and resulted in the DEBG achieving its highest network length of 264.5 km excluding the 32 km of the VEE. At the start of the Second World War the following branch lines in Baden belonged to the DEBG: * Acher Valley Railway * Alb Valley Railway * Katzbach Railway * Kraich Valley Railway * B√ºhler Valley Railway * Harmersbach Valley Railway * Jagst Valley Railway * Kander Valley Railway * M√ºnster Valley Railway * Neckarbischofsheim‚ÄìH√ºffenhardt railway * Oberschefflenz-Billigheim railway * Orschweier-Ettenheimm√ºnster railway * Wiesloch‚ÄìMeckesheim/Waldangelloch railway In the north of Germany the DEBG only owned the Voldagsen-Duingen-Delligsen railway which ran through the Prussian provinces of Hanover and the neighbouring state of Brunswick. There in the Weser Uplands it also ran the Vorwohle-Emmerthal Railway Company, in which it had acquired a majority shareholding. The VEE owned the main workshop for all DEBG railways in Bodenwerder-Linse; it was also responsible for the Baden railways.  Development after the Second World War  The establishment of the Inner German Border did not affect the DEBG as all its railways lay in West Germany. Nevertheless, as a result of declining demand on the DEBG's branch lines it withdrew progressively from railway operations. In 1956/57 it sold the electrified sections of the Alb Valley Railway, that ran from Karlsruhe to the northern Black Forest, to the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, who transferred them to the newly founded Abtal-Verkehrs-GmbH. After the end of 1956 passenger services on the B√ºhl‚ÄìOberb√ºhlertal railway were withdrawn, goods traffic ceased in autumn 1958. The remaining ten lines in Baden- W√ºrttemberg were transferred by the DEBG on 1 May 1963 into the newly formed state-owned S√ºdwestdeutsche Eisenbahn. In 1968 the DEBG also got rid of the Voldagsen-Duingen-Delligsen branch line. Meanwhile, the company began to be wound up; this was concluded in 1970. Operations by the VEE were transferred on 1 May 1967 to the Vorwohle-Emmerthaler Verkehrsbetriebe.

The first season of the show was hosted by Martin Singh and Vishal Malhotra, and Salman and Shoib Malik were the judges. All the episodes were shot in Sony TV's Mumbai studio.  Concept  Entertainment Ke Liye aur bhi Kuch Bhi Karega was based on the popular American reality TV talent show 30 Seconds to Fame in which participants show off their unique talent and stand to win a cash prize. A participant must perform for one minute, without being voted out by the audience or judges, to win the cash prize of Rs. 11,111. The judges and audience have the authority to vote out a participant, although the judges can use their veto to give a disqualified participant another chance. To cast their vote, they are provided an electronic disapproval voting system. If more than 60 percent of the audience or either of the judges cast a negative vote, a so-called \\"deadly hooter\\" sounds and the participant is eliminated. However, if the participant is not voted out within the one-minute period, he or she qualifies for the cash prize of Rs. 11,111.

History On 10 June 1940, during World War II, Italy declared war on Great Britain and France. This declaration included the Italian colonies and colonists already located in Africa. The Italians initially attacked Egypt, and the British, allied to the Egyptians by the 1936 treaty, counterattacked and occupied Cyrenaica. The Italians asked for help from their German allies; as a result, the Germans entered the North African theatre of war. The war continued with no decisive victory until the German- Italian forces were defeated at the Second Battle of Alamein in late 1942. German-Italian forces withdrew from Egypt and Libya to Tunisia. The British, with the help of their American allies, defeated their opponents on 12 May 1943, ending the North African campaign. During the war, each side used land- mines to impede the enemy's progress. While it is unknown how many mines were used throughout North Africa, it is known from the memoirs of Erwin Rommel that some 80,000 mines were laid at the Buerat-Line in Libya.The Rommel Papers, vol.5, p.650 Many of the mines are still operational and pose a risk to local populations. The responsibility for removing them has been left to the governments of North African nations. Egypt One of the United Nations's missions estimated there are 19.7 million mines in the western desert of Egypt.A. I. Mahmud, p.233 Great efforts have been made in extracting mines. In a 1997 interview with Major-General Ibrahim Abdul-Fattah, chief of military engineers in the Egyptian armed forces. He stated that 8,301 Egyptian persons (civilian and military) were affected by land mines by 1997. Of them, 7,611 were wounded and 690 were killed.A. I. Mahmud, p.250 In order to remove the mines, Italian and German old battlefield maps (the German records are more complete) are used in combination with satellite maps to pinpoint dangerous areas. The old maps are not enough because, according to the scientist Ayman Shabana, \\"many mines have moved due to floods, climate changes or the movement of sand dunes over half a century.\\" Libya Land mine from WW II at Bir Hakeim, Libya Defused dud near Bir Hakeim, Libya The White Book, issued by the Libyan government in 1981, shows that for every year from 1939 (before the war) to 1975, Libyans were killed by the explosion of left-over military munitions (including mines), except for the years 1969-70.The White Book, p.146-147 1945 had the deadliest record of 130 people killed.The White Book, p.146 Most mine fields are located in the coastal area,The White Book, p.149 the most populated zone of the country. Libya also has a bad heritage of land mines from the Libyan-Egyptian war in 1977. During the Libyan civil war in 2011, Muammar al Qadafi's regime laid land mines to check the advance of the rebel forces.Libya:Government Use of Landmines Confirmed In the 1990s about one dozen explosives removal teams worked in the former battle fields in Libya to defuse land mines and duds. Since the European countries did not feel responsible for the removal of these explosives, the Libyan government had to pay for this dangerous work. Tunisia \\"On March 17 [1943] General George S. Patton captured Gafsa. On April 8 he joined up with the 8th Army, whilst on his left, the French XIX Corps moved towards the Eastern Dorsale. But neither of them were able to intercept the Italian army as it retreated north towards Enfidaville via Sfax and Sousse. This was because of the vast numbers of land-mines that Italian and German sappers laid, one of which killed Major-General Edouard Welvert, commanding the \\"Constantine\\" Motorised Division, as they were entering Kairouan\\".Peter Young (ed.), the History of World War II, vol.12, p.1087 Today, the Tunisian Army is extracting between 200-300 mines every year.A. I. Mahmud, p.208 Western Sahara Morocco has constructed a 2,700 km (1,700 mi) long berm (sand wall) cutting through the length of Western Sahara. Minefields and watchtowers serve to separate the Moroccan-controlled zone from the sparsely populated Free Zone. Several thousand people have been killed or injured as a result of stepping on land mines, as have numerous Sahrawi livestock (goats and camels). Diplomatic efforts Although these three countries suffer from the same problem, they have never unified their diplomatic engagements with the formerly belligerent countries, Italy, Germany, and Great Britain. This weakened their positions in demanding the extraction of the mines, and compensation for war damages. Libya and Egypt work apart. Tunisia signed the Ottawa Treaty in December 1997, calling for banning the use of mines in warfare,A. I. Mahmud, pp.140-141 but this signing will not save its people from the danger of mines.

She falls in love with Rana Ratan Singh, the heir to the throne of Chittod, Rajputana who comes to Singhaldweep after seeing a painting of her in his palace made by Chittod's painter / musician Raghav Chetan. He wins the princess's marriage contest, defeating warrior Padam Singh (which is actually Padmavati in disguise) in a sword fight and asking her to marry him, without the permission of his own parents. After much debate, Padmavati and Ratan Singh are wed together with the blessings of Padmavati's parents and all of Singhaldweep. Padmavati is permanently renamed \\"Padmini\\" by her husband, Ratan Singh, who then leave for Chittod along with a royal procession. In Chittod, Princess Naagmati, Ratan Singh's first wife and his child, Yashovardhan's mother, opposes this second marriage and Padmini's entry in the royal palace. She appeals to the Queen of Chittod, her mother-in-law and former rival, to protest against her husband's adultery persuading her to forget their own quarrels and join hands together to \\"destroy\\" Padmini. On his wedding night, Naagmati forever forbids her husband to go to Padmini's palace after dusk and thereby stopping him from having sex with Padmini, in exchange for letting him see his son. Under pretenses of \\"Chittod's long-lasting palace traditions,\\" Naagmati organizes various contests against Padmini, only to lose each time. Parallel to this story is the tale of North India's then ruler Sultan Ala-ud-din Khalji, usurper of his uncle's throne through deceit and murder, who is now intent on conquering Rajputana and its kingdoms (including Chittod).

Development Design of the P.531Jackson 1974, p 295 and 329 was started in November 1957 as a private venture improvement of the company's earlier Skeeter.Orbis 1985, p 3093 The first prototypes were powered by a derated 325 shp Blackburn Turbomeca Turmo 600, a free turbine engine allowing clutchless transmission. The P.531 first flew on 20 July 1958. Three more developed P.531-0s followed and these were delivered to the Royal Navy/Fleet Air Arm for trials and familiarisation. Following evaluation by the Navy a batch of 30 developed aircraft were eventually ordered as the Westland Wasp. Two militiarised P.531-2s were completed in 1959, powered by the Blackburn Nimbus and the de Havilland Gnome H1000 free-turbine engines, both derated to 635 hp now that the transmission tests had proved such powers acceptable. Like the Turmo installation, these engines were mounted, uncowled behind the cabin for easy servicing. There were aerodynamic shape revisions and a floor extension to allow six, rather than five seats. The vision was improved with perspex panels in the doors, tankage was increased and all-metal rotors introduced. These modifications increased gross weight by 1,200 lb (544 kg). Saro had an order for eight pre-production aircraft from the British Army‚Ä≤s Army Air Corps for evaluation and trials; these would have been known as the Saro Sprite, but the company was taken over by Westland Helicopters and the aircraft became the first Westland Scout A.H.1s.

In 1983, Dalton gave notice to Personnel Department that he intended to stand as Conservative candidate for the Richmond, North Yorkshire constituency in the 1983 general election. However, he withdrew his candidacy for the seat before the story broke of his sister- in-law Sara Keays' affair with Trade and Industry Secretary Cecil Parkinson, and was posted as Head of Chancery to Muscat, Oman, in 1983.The Diplomatic Service List 1989 (page 155), HMSO, In her 1985 book A Question of Judgement, Sara Keays wrote \\"You've got to bear in mind that my brother-in-law Richard is a diplomat\\". From 1993 to 1997, Dalton was Consul-General in Jerusalem effectively becoming Ambassador to the Palestinian Authority during the early years of the Middle East peace process. He was appointed Head of Personnel in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1998, and was sent as Britain's Ambassador to Libya in 1999, when diplomatic relations were resumed after a 17-year break. Between 2003 and 2006, Dalton was ambassador to Iran.

He was formerly Minister of Brechin Cathedral in the Church of Scotland 1999 ‚Äì 2009. Background Rennie was born on 31 March 1972 in Bucksburn, Aberdeen, Scotland. He studied geography at the University of Aberdeen, and Divinity at Christ's College, Aberdeen. He served as Assistant Minister at Queen's Cross Church, Aberdeen, studying for a Masters in Sacred Theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York City on a Scots Fellowship. Rennie was a member of the Church of Scotland's Taskforce on Human Sexuality until it was disbanded in 2012. Rennie married Ruth, and they had a daughter together. After five years of marriage they separated and divorced. Rennie subsequently formed a relationship with his now husband, David SmithOrder of Proceedings of the General Assembly 2009, p. 43 an educationalist at the University of Aberdeen http://www.abdn.ac.uk/education/staff/details.php?id=davidsmith and Religion scholar. at the Bloomsbury Press website Rennie is a member of the Liberal Democrats and was their candidate for the Angus constituency in the 2005 UK general election. He is also a well-known supporter of Aberdeen Football Club, aka 'The Dons'.  Ministry and controversy Queen's Cross Church= On 23 November 2008, Rennie preached as sole nominee for Queen's Cross Church, having informed the congregation of his circumstances. At the conclusion of the service, following a secret ballot, he was duly declared Minister Elect by 140 votes to 28.Order of Proceedings, p. 44 Subsequently, 246 members of the church and 13 other adherents signed the Call.Order of Proceedings, p. 63 The call from Queen's Cross Church was upheld by the Presbytery of Aberdeen on 6 January 2009 by 60 votes to 24. This was the first time that a congregation and presbytery had voted to sustain the call of an openly gay minister within the Church of Scotland. However, following the presbytery's vote which allowed Rennie to proceed to Queen's Cross Parish Church, a group of 12 ministers and elders within the Presbytery, led by Ian Aitken (New Stockethill, New Charge Development, Aberdeen), dissented (objected) and complained to the Commission of the General Assembly.Order of Proceedings, pp. 37-38 On 25 March 2009, following a narrow majority of 1, it was agreed by the Commission that the case be referred to the General Assembly, the Church of Scotland's supreme court, for judgement.Order of Proceedings, p. 35 It was the first time that a presbytery's decision to sustain the call of a minister had been challenged in the church's supreme court since the Disruption of 1843. Following an apology from evangelical Church of Scotland organisation Forward Together over an incorrect statement concerning Rennie's personal circumstances, a conversation between Rennie and OneKirk Convener, Peter Johnston, was published, in which Rennie spoke about the challenge of growing up in a conservative church: > As a young man growing up in a conservative church, it felt impossible to > deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe > environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and > understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and do what I > thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life. Judith Pearson and Trevor Salmon, joint session clerks of Queen's Cross, wrote to The Herald newspaper in support of Rennie, saying: > The congregation were fully conversant with all relevant facts before they > voted for and signed the call to Scott Rennie. Our call is based upon his > gifts and our corresponding needs, and upon our real sense that he is the > person best equipped to serve alongside us and to offer leadership to us. =General Assembly 2009= The case against Rennie was titled Aitken and Others versus the Presbytery of Aberdeen, and heard on Saturday 23 May 2009. It was intended to answer the following question: > What was the law of the Church at the time (6 January 2009) the Presbytery > of Aberdeen made the decision that has been challenged; and was the > Presbytery entitled to make the decision it made in the light of the legal > position at that time?Order of Proceedings, p. 34 On the same evening that Rennie's case was heard, an overture (motion) was to be received from the Presbytery of Lochcarron-Skye which, in the light of Rennie's call to Queen's Cross, sought to prevent anyone in an extra-marital sexual relationship from working in the church: > No court or agency of the Church may accept for training, ordain, admit, re- > admit, induct or introduce to any ministry of the Church anyone involved in > a sexual relationship outside of faithful marriage between a man and a > woman.Order of Proceedings, p. 65 William J. U. Philip, the minister of St George's-Tron Church, Glasgow, in concert with Forward Together, founded an online petition in order to support this overture, which received 12,555 signatures, including 481 Church of Scotland Ministers and 33 Kirk Sessions, and also to express their opposition to the appointment of Rennie. On the opening day of the Church of Scotland's General Assembly, Thursday 21 May, an attempt was made to change the order of business by hearing the Locharran-Skye overture before the Rennie case, against the legal advice of the Overture and Appeals Committee.Order of Proceedings, pp. 33-34 The attempt to change the order of business was interpreted by some as being designed to strengthen the cause of those opposed to Rennie's appointment. Speaking to his motion, Peter Parks argued that it would be illogical to decide a specific case without having already established the principle against which the case would be tested. The General Assembly was unconvinced and comfortably defeated Parks's motion, having been persuaded that it would be unjust to hear the overture first due to the danger of anachronism. On the day of Rennie's hearing, 23 May, a protest against the appointment was held outside the General Assembly Hall by around twenty members of Glasgow's Zion Baptist Church. The American Westboro Baptist Church announced its intention to picket the meeting of the General Assembly on 23 May and Queen's Cross Church on 24 May,Westboro Baptish Church flyer: \\"WBC to picket Scotland\\" although this did not go ahead. A counter-protest was held by a number of groups, including Liberal Youth Scotland, the Scottish youth wing of the Liberal Democrats, which attracted around eighty demonstrators.Facebook listing: Liberal Youth Scotland 'Protest Against the Westboro Baptist Church' On 23 May, the General Assembly voted 326 to 267 to uphold the nomination of Rennie. 121 commissioners formally dissented in writing against this decision.General Assembly minutes Debate on the Lochcarron-Skye overture was postponed until Monday 25 May, when it was decided to establish a two-year Special Commission on the issue reporting in 2011. A moratorium on the induction and ordination of openly gay ministers was passed until that time, and a ban on making public statements concerning the induction and ordination of gay ministers also came into effect. In January 2009, a censurable allegation against Rennie, that his 'lifestyle' constituted a great 'public scandal' (or Fama Clamosa in Church of Scotland law), was lodged with the Presbytery of Angus (in which Brechin Cathedral resides). A committee of three was formed to investigate this allegation, but it was immediately suspended due to the pending Aitken and Others versus the Presbytery of Aberdeen case. On 25 May, the General Assembly passed a motion moved by Allan McCafferty, which clarified the General Assembly's will that Rennie be inducted into the charge of Queen's Cross Church, without further hindrance: > For the avoidance of doubt affirm that the provisions of this whole motion > shall in no way be interpreted as offering grounds for challenging the > decision of the General Assembly of 2009 in the Referred Case heard in > Session V and all other related matters of process [emphasis added].Minutes > of the Proceedings of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, p. 98 On Wednesday 3 June, an Angus Presbytery Investigating Committee met to consider the allegation against Rennie that his 'lifestyle' was not acceptable for a minister of the gospel. However, this charge was not upheld and Rennie was released to move to Aberdeen Presbytery, where he was subsequently inducted into the charge of Queen's Cross Parish Church on Friday 3 July at 1900. On Sunday 5 July, James Simpson, a former moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, led worship and preached the first sermon by way of welcome to Rennie. =Post-General Assembly 2009 to Present= Rennie was nominated for, and subsequently won, the award of 'Hero of the Year' at the Fourth Annual Stonewall Awards, which took place on Thursday 5 November 2009. On 24 March 2010 he was given the ceremonial role of Burgess of Guild of the City of Aberdeen. On Thursday 24 February, Rennie was invited to participate in a debate at the Cambridge Union Society entitled: 'This House Believes the Path to Success is Straight.' Alongside Lieutenant Commanders Craig Jones MBE and Mandy McBain, Rennie proposed the motion, while Lord Smith of Finsbury, Andrew Pierce, and Femi Otitoju were narrowly successful in opposing it. On Sunday 31 July 2011, the U.S. Westboro Baptist Church announced its intention to picket Queen's Cross Church, Aberdeen on 30 October 2011.Westboro Baptish Church flyer: \\"IT IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE SCOTLAND IS DOOMED!\\" Member of the Scottish Parliament Mark McDonald lodged motion S4M-00609 ('Planned Westboro Baptist Church Visit to Aberdeen') in the Scottish Parliament in order to 'call' on Home Secretary Theresa May to confirm the continuation of the 2009 ban on Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps- Roper and to extend it to other members of the Westboro Baptist Church: > That the Parliament notes the stated intention of the Westboro Baptist > Church to picket Queen's Cross Church in Aberdeen in protest at the presence > of the Reverend Scott Rennie; further notes that the Westboro Baptist Church > has gained notoriety for its extreme, homophobic views and pickets of > American soldiers' funerals; also notes that the head of the church, Pastor > Fred Phelps, and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, appeared on a list of > individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom in 2009; considers that > the views espoused by Pastor Phelps and his followers have no place in 21st > century Scotland, and calls on the Home Secretary to confirm the > continuation of the ban on their entry to the UK and to consider extending > it to cover all known members of Westboro Baptist Church.\\"Motion S4M-00609 - > Mark McDonald (North East Scotland) (Scottish National Party) : Planned > Westboro Baptist Church Visit to Aberdeen\\" Rennie replied to the planned visit by Westboro Baptist Church by emphasising the welcoming character of Queen's Cross Church and Jesus, whilst also highlighting the dangers of fundamentalism: > \\"Everyone and anyone is welcome at Queen's Cross Church - that's the way > Jesus was, and that's the way we are.

They > happen to shout a lot, whereas others hold their hateful views more > secretly.\\" He continued: \\"Most Christians are neither homophobic nor > extremist, but are moderate people who seek to share the love of God in the > community in which they live.\\" Fred Phelps responded by condemning the Church of Scotland, Scott Rennie, the Government of the United Kingdom, and Mark McDonald in a YouTube broadcast.'Paster' Fred Phelps to Scotland: NO GAY PREACHERS!: Following the restatement of the ban on the Phelps' entry to the United Kingdom, the Aberdeen National Front (United Kingdom) indicated their intention to protest against Scott Rennie and Queen's Cross Church, Aberdeen on Sunday 30 October. In a rare interview on Radio Scotland's 'Sunday Morning with Ricky Ross', broadcast on 25 September 2011, Rennie discussed his faith and life. Commenting on the Scottish Government's marriage consultation, Rennie stated that 'marriage has always been an evolving institution'. On Sunday 2 October 2011, the English Churchman distributed anti-gay leaflets to church attendees prior to the 10am Sunday service and affixed a poster to the church notice board. On Thursday 2 February 2012, The Scotsman newspaper reported that a motion had been lodged with the Presbytery of Aberdeen by Louis Kinsey of St Columba's Church, Aberdeen, in order to seek to prevent Queen's Cross Church from allowing Hindus to meet \\"every second Sunday afternoon\\" in their \\"congregational hall\\" due to their \\"sacrificial worship offered to idols and false deities...[which] contravenes the First and Second Commandments.\\"'Kirk minister demands ban on \\"sacrificial\\" Hindu worship'. The Rennie responded: \\"They [the Hindus] are lovely people. They are part of our local community and they are welcome. We don‚Äôt have any problem with it at all. There is nothing innovative in what we are doing.\\" The Presbytery of Aberdeen met on Tuesday 7 February 2012 and heard the Kinsey's motion in private. The motion was defeated and the Presbytery of Aberdeen stated: \\"On a vote being taken, the motion was narrowly defeated but it was recognised by many speakers that, despite their diversity, all views were sincerely held.\\"\\"Hindu association can carry on worshipping\\", Press and Journal, Thursday, 9 February 2012. The matter was raised and defeated at General Assembly 2012 by Ian Watson, who, following Queen's Cross Church and Scott Rennie's hosting of a local Hindu Association, sought for the General Assembly to ban worship on Christian premises of non-Christian faiths.\\"Gay-row church 'allowed worship of false idols by taking in Hindus'\\", The Scotsman, Monday, 21 May 2012 . However, Watson's position did not find majority support. On Saturday 28 July 2012, The Scotsman reported comments by the Rennie made in response to the Scottish Government's marriage consultation: > ‚ÄúI believe that love shared and celebrated in society, between two people of > the same sex, should make no-one afraid and can only enrich the communities > in which we live. This legislation will provide both civil and religious > marriage for those who wish to celebrate it and a respectful space of > objection for those who do not.

On Monday 20 May 2013, the Church of Scotland's General Assembly voted to provide Kirk Sessions with the authority to select LGB ministers. Speaking the following day on BBC Radio Scotland‚Äôs Good Morning Scotland breakfast programme, Rennie welcomed this decision: > ‚ÄúThere is no doubt that it [the vote] is a milestone, because it is at last > a recognition of the place of gay and lesbian people in the ministry, of > which there are a number. It also recognises liberty of conscience on this > matter, as there is on many other matters, within the broad church that is > the national church...There is no doubt, an important step has been taken > yesterday. The interview revealed aspects of Rennie's progressive Christian theology, as he rejected the charge that the General Assembly's decision a represented a move to remain aligned with societal social mores: > \\"I think the church always has to try and figure out its faith in the > context in which it lives, and obviously our understanding of sexuality, of > gender, as with many other things in life, has changed - and is forever > changing. But I wouldn‚Äôt want to characterise this as a move to somehow just > go along with society. I think for those of us who believe in inclusion, > that comes from a point of view that we really believe that Jesus was for > inclusion; we believe that God is for inclusion; and we believe in a God of > love. And that‚Äôs fundamental to our faith and our understanding.\\" Following a vote by all Presbyteries of the Church of Scotland in favour of allowing the ordination of Ministers in Civil Partnerships,\\"Results of Presbytery vote on overture on ordination of ministers in civil partnerships‚Äô\\". on Thursday 8 January 2015, Rennie commented on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland that the vote was: \\"a very positive vote for the Kirk and for Scotland\\".\\"Good Morning Scotland 08/01/2015\\". On 20 January 2015, Rennie gave the Time for Reflection for Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. He discussed Robert Burns and human nature.

They consulted the Liberal Chief Whip and party headquarters in 1919 but no nominee came forward until Thompson was adopted as Liberal candidate for Torquay in 1922.Matthew Worley, Labour's grass roots: essays on the activities and experiences of local labour parties and members, 1918-45; Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005 pp14-15 At the 1918 general election the Liberal candidate, Captain Russell Cooke, had finished a poor third behind Coalition Conservative and Labour opponents, gaining just 15% of the poll.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p332 =1922-1923= In 1922, Thompson faced a straight fight against the sitting Tory MP, Colonel Charles Rosdew Burn, who was a distinguished ex-soldier and an Aide-de-camp to the King.The Times House of Commons 1919, Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004 p50 In the absence of a Labour candidate Burn's majority was reduced from the 10,039 he had obtained in 1918 to 1,251 or 4.4% of the poll. Burn stood down from the House of Commons at the 1923 general election. Thompson had another straight fight in Torquay this time against the new Conservative candidate Charles Williams. In a tight contest, Thompson emerged as the winner by the narrow majority of 372 votes, just 1.2% of the total votes cast. =1924= At the 1924 general election Thompson faced the intervention of a Labour candidate, Arthur Moyle, who later went on to be MP for Stourbridge. Labour's decision to stand was criticised by the Liberals as serving only to split the anti-Tory vote.\\"Devon And Cornwall Contests\\", The Times, 20 October 1924 Charles Williams renewed his attack on the seat for the Conservatives. The Tory revival in the country at large was repeated in Torquay and Williams obtained 55% of the poll to win by a majority of 6,161 over Thompson. Moyle came bottom of the poll, losing his deposit but it can hardly be contended that his intervention cost Thompson the seat. The level of support for Williams was too great and the Liberal Party's decline was a national phenomenon.Michael Kinnear, The British Voter: An Atlas and Survey since 1885; Cornell University Press, 1968 p46 =1924-1940= After he lost in 1924 Thompson declined to stand again in Torquay. The local Liberal Association did however approach him again when they were looking for a new candidate after the 1929 general election but he was unwilling to take it on. Thompson made his home in Shipbourne near Tonbridge in Kent Who Was Who, OUP 2007 and in 1936 accepted an invitation to become Liberal candidate for the Sevenoaks Division of Kent,The Times, 7 December 1936 p11 although he never contested an election in the seat. In fact he never stood for Parliament again. He maintained his connection with Liberalism however and was sometime Honorary Secretary of the Home Counties Liberal Federation.The Times, 29 April 1940 p3 He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the Proportional Representation Society.Proportional Representation Society's Quarterly; Item notes: nos. 7-12 p3 Death Thompson died on 7 February 1969 aged 75 years.http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Tcommons2.htm References External links  * Category:1893 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People educated at Winchester College Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Publishers (people) from London Category:UK MPs 1923‚Äì1924 Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Politics of Devon Category:People from Shipbourne Category:People from Battersea ","title":"P.

Similar colloquial groups include: Public Ivies, Southern Ivies, and the Little Ivies among others, none of which have canonical definitions. Generally, the schools themselves avoid using the term Black Ivy to describe themselves. Black Ivy schools are not affiliated with the NCAA Ivy League sports conference. The actual Ivy League is an eight- member athletic conference. At one point in history, some of these institutions debated forming a Black Ivy League athletic conference without reaching an agreement. Members There is no agreement as to which schools are included in the \\"Black Ivy League\\", and sources list different possible members. The 1984 book Blacks in Colleges by Dr. Jacqueline Fleming states that the schools that make up the Black Ivy league are Dillard University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Howard University, Morehouse College, Spelman College and Tuskegee University. Fleming further notes that, \\"[t]he presence of Black Ivy League colleges pull the best and most privileged black students... [A]ll seven are unique schools, with little overlap among them.\\" Bill Maxwell, in a 2003 series on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), coincides with Fleming in describing the Black Ivy League institutions as being those seven. The North Star News described Fisk, Hampton, Howard, Morehouse, Tuskegee as well as Cheyney University of Pennsylvania and Morgan State University as the equivalent of a Black Ivy League. Lincoln University has also been mentioned as being included in the group. In 1976, the Chicago Tribune included Morehouse, Spelman, Atlanta and Clark Universities (the latter merged Clark Atlanta University), Morris Brown College, and Gannon University as the Black Ivies. Description and legacy Although there is a debate about the composition of the group, they shared certain historic characteristics. During the late 20th century, students who attended these schools were able to learn trades and acquire skills and status which put them in a distinctly different social class of black Americans.Our Kind of People: Inside America's Upper Class, Lawrence Otis Graham (2000). While these institutions were the favorites for upper-class blacks who chose to attend HBCU's prior to 1970,Graham, L. (2000). Our Kind of People: inside America's Black upper class. New York, NY: HarperPerennial. Pg. 10 between 1970 and 1990, a large number of affluent blacks elected to attend predominantly white colleges and universities. Seven of these institutions are located in the South, while Howard, Lincoln, Cheyney, and Morgan are located in the Mid-Atlantic states. Each of these institutions are co-educational with the exception of Morehouse College, which is an all-male institution and Spelman College, an all-female institution. All institutions are currently accredited by such organizations as the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  History  The founding of two members, Lincoln University and Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, predate the American Civil War. The remaining members were founded in the late 19th century except for Xavier University of Louisiana, which was founded in 1915 by the Catholic Church. During the relevant time period, these institutions upheld a tradition of academic excellence. In 1952, Fisk was the first historically black institution to charter a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Morehouse has produced the first and one of the largest number of Rhodes Scholars from an HBCU. Howard continues to lead all universities in producing the highest number of black doctorate recipients and has the highest endowment of any HBCU in the nation. Spelman College has consistently been recognized as one of the top ten women's college in the nation.https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-womens-colleges/ George Washington Carver conducted many of his noteworthy peanut experiments while a professor at Tuskegee. Similarly, the largest percentage of African-Americans holding graduate and professional degrees, attended these colleges as undergraduates. From 1897 ‚Äì 1909, W.E.B. Du Bois conducted the Atlanta University Studies, a ‚Äúsystematic, social-scientific inquiries into the condition and lives of African Americans‚Äù and penned The Souls of Black Folk (1903) ‚Äúperhaps the most influential work of his generation on the African American experience‚Äù during his first term as a professor of economics, history and sociology at what was at the time Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta). Dubois left Atlanta University in 1909, the same year that he co- founded the NAACP and returned to Atlanta University in 1934, where he published his last major work, Black Reconstruction in America (1935) and remained until his retirement in 1944. Current status Prior to the 1960s, African-American students and staff experienced serious discrimination in United States higher education. During that era, these schools attracted the best African-American students and faculty. However, since the 1960s, these institutions have had great difficulty in competing with Ivy League and other historically white colleges for top students and faculty The North Star News notes, \\"As Blacks enrolled in predominantly white colleges and southern states did not invest in Black colleges, HBCU‚Äôs were put at a distinct disadvantage. Today, many of these institutions are struggling to keep pace with white institutions in terms of course offerings, facilities, athletics, and student services.\\" Yet, Black Ivy League schools enroll more black National Merit Scholars than elite traditional schools, such as Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, perhaps because these students have financial aid independent of the school they attend. As reported by the Washington Post, \\"Top-tier schools--including Howard, Hampton University, and Spelman and Morehouse colleges--vie with Harvard and Princeton for top black students and faculty.\\" Since the 1960s, the Ivy League has actively recruited black people who now play prominent roles in each of its institutions, including faculty holding endowed professorships, head athletic coaches, deans, and one president, Ruth Simmons (Dillard graduate) of Brown University. From 1967 to 1976, black enrollment in Ivy League colleges rose from 2.3% to 6.3%. In addition, Ivy League alumni who are African-American have formed the Black Ivy Alumni League, as well as separate black alumni groups for each individual university. The Black Ivy Alumni League notes that \\"over 50,000 alumni of African descent connected through our Ivy League experiences.\\" African Americans who earned undergraduate degrees at Ivy League schools include former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce, President Barack Obama; his wife, First Lady Michelle Obama; college basketball coaches Craig Robinson (Michelle Obama's brother) and John Thompson III. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas earned his bachelor's degree at a non-Ivy school, but earned his J.D. at Yale Law School. In 2004, the Institute for Research in African-American Studies (IRAAS) at Columbia University sponsored an academic conference entitled \\"Growing Black Ivy\\" which drew 200 scholars to discuss black participation at elite Ivy League institutions. Competition for top students have grown more intense. For example, Cornell announced a change in its financial aid policy to match the financial aid package offered by other schools to any admitted students who might otherwise be tempted to enroll elsewhere. Morehouse College drew national publicity in 2008, when its valedictorian, Joshua Packwood, a white student, explained that he opted to attend Morehouse, when he had received full scholarship offers from both Morehouse and Columbia University. The relative size of the institutions and their respective endowments also affect each school's relative ability to provide elite instruction. For example, Cornell University's freshman class included 371 black and multiracial students, which is more than the freshman class of Dillard. From 1999 to 2007, Ivy League colleges launched initiatives to make higher education more affordable, to the point that students from low income families can graduate debt-free. The University of Pennsylvania has expanded its financial aid program to the point that all students qualifying for financial aid can graduate debt-free. The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education notes that the significant increase in financial aid by Harvard and other Ivy League schools will make it difficult for other schools to compete for top African- American students. A study of the average wages of alumni conducted by Roland G. Fryer Jr. and Michael Greenstone, found that between the 1970s and the 1990s, \\"there is a wage penalty\\" in attending a HBCU over those attending historically white colleges, \\"resulting in a 20% decline in the relative wages of HBCU graduates between the two decades.\\" Subscription required, focusing on two Black Ivy schools Unlike the Ivy League, the main focus of the Black Ivy League has been on undergraduate education. However, Howard University has several graduate-level professional programs, including a medical school, and Morehouse at one time had a medical school, which has since become independent. There are two other historically black medical schools not affiliated with Black Ivy League-identified colleges, located in Nashville, Tennessee, and Los Angeles, California. , these four medical schools \\"reportedly account[ed] for more than half of all Black medical school graduates\\" in the United States. Tuskegee has had a School of Veterinary Medicine since the 1930s and began awarding PhDs in the 1980s. Regarding extension and outreach, many of the HBCUs which are not in the Black Ivy League are land grant universities, founded in response to the Second Morrill Act of 1890. As a result, those institutions receive annual federal and state appropriations to conduct extension activities, which are not available to the Black Ivy League schools, except for Tuskegee University, which began to receive Cooperative Extension funding in 1972. However, the Black Ivy League schools have received Part B federal aid under the Higher Education Act of 1965 as HBCUs.

He started his career as a passenger before switching to driver in 2000, handing the passenger seat to his childhood friend Darren Hope. In 2001 the TT races were cancelled due to Foot and Mouth, so Nick and Darren concentrated on different races in the UK and the Isle of Man. The next year was a good year for the pair. In 2004, with the purchase of Dave Molyneux's outfit, the team could go faster in the Southern 100, at Jurby, and in the TT. 2005 brought Nick's first TT win in Race A, beating rival Dave Molyneux, who finished second in Race B. In 2006, the A & J Groundworks outfit won the Double, both Race A and B. In 2007, with new passenger Daniel Sayle, Crowe set what was then the fastest-ever sidecar lap. However, the team were forced to retire from the lead in both races. With another new passenger, Mark Cox, Crowe won both Race 1 and 2 in 2008. In 2009, Crowe and Cox were on a Honda HM Plant/Dave Hudspeth Carpets F2 600cc. Crowe and Cox qualified in pole for the 2009 event but suffered mechanical failure whilst leading race one. In race two the pair crashed heavily at the 17 mile marker (Ballacob) on lap 1 and were taken to Noble's Hospital by air with serious fractures. The crash was caused by a hare running onto the course in front of the duo. The race was cancelled, as was the following practice for the Senior TT. Nick was flown to the UK where he had a number of operations. Returning to the Island, he became involved in sidecar racing, running his own team with Simon Neary and Paul Napton sponsored by HMPLANT and Dave Hudspeth Carpets.

Plot A New York City poet named Archy (Eddie Bracken) attempts suicide only to come back as a cockroach. As he learns how to write poetry by hopping on typewriter keys, he grows used to his new life and becomes infatuated with Mehitabel (Carol Channing), the singing alley cat. She instead goes out with the tomcat Big Bill (Alan Reed). When Big Bill dumps Mehitabel, Archy confronts her about her wild ways in general and her affinity for bad boy tomcats in particular. She momentarily agrees; however, self-appointed theatre maestro cat Tyrone T. Tattersall (John Carradine) promises to make her a star and becomes her next lover. Archy attempts and fails suicide again. In the theatre, Mehitabel holds up her end of the deal in getting food for Tyrone, but he kicks her off the stage. Archy and Big Bill watch her, and Mehitabel gets back together with Big Bill. Back to his typewriter, Archy channels his frustration in calling the other insects and spiders to revolution. He immediately drops the scheme when he hears the news that Mehitabel has kittens, and Big Bill has left the scene again. It's a rainy evening, and Archy points out to Mehitabel, that her kittens, who are inside a cover less trashcan, are floating away from her, and the two of them rescue the kittens, however, a moody Mehitabel, chases Archy away for interfering with her private business. Archy persuades Mehitabel to give up her life as an alley cat and support the kittens with a \\"job\\" as a house cat. Later, however, when Archy comes to visit her in the upscale house, with her visibly changed by the experience, she reminds him that social class now separates them from being friends and kicks him out‚Äîregretting it later. Archy gets drunk and meets several ladybug street walkers who find his love poems about Mehitabel. Big Bill makes fun of him. One day, Mehitabel returns to Shinbone Alley and sings and dances again like her old self. After having tried to reform her, Archy realizes he liked Mehitabel for her wild ways all along and accepts her for \\"being what she has to be,\\" content to be just friends.Cinema Cats Voice cast *Carol Channing ...

However, New York magazine critic Judith Crist called it \\"a blend of literature, musical comedy and fine arts... pure sophisticated entertainment for all, and a refreshment for moviegoers.\\" Vincent Canby, in his New York Times review, wrote: \\"'Shinbone Alley' is a little like the old mehitabel. It suffers from split personality being based, as it is, on works that must go over the heads of 8-year-olds .. but it's executed in a mostly juvenile style that's not too far removed from what the children see on television. It's a very mixed bag and this, in case you hadn't guessed, is a very mixed review.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Shinbone Alley on IMDb *Shinbone Alley at Rotten Tomatoes *Shinbone Alley at AllMovie Category:1970 films Category:1970 animated films Category:1970s American animated films Category:1970s musical comedy films Category:Adaptations of works by Don Marquis Category:Adaptations of works by Mel Brooks Category:Allied Artists films Category:American films Category:Animated comedy films Category:Animated films about cats Category:Animated films about insects Category:Animated musical films Category:American musical comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films about reincarnation Category:Films based on adaptations Category:Films based on musicals Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films directed by John David Wilson Category:1970 comedy films ","title":"Shinbone Alley (film)"},{"id":"22824683","text":"is a singer, actor, and member of the Japanese pop idol group Shonentai.

He is the former Chairman, Board of Governors of Management Development Institute (MDI), Gurgaon. He is currently the Chairman of the review committee set up under Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, under the purview of Ministry of Finance, Government of India. Early life and Career Born in Kolkata on 27 January 1941, Singh did his schooling at St. Xavier's High School, Patna and completed his Senior Cambridge Examination at St. Xavier's College, Patna before he joined St Stephens College, Delhi for pursuing graduation. He did Masters in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics (DSE) at a time when well-known economists like Sukhamoy Chakravarty, Amartya Sen and Jagdish Bhagwati were on the faculty. Before beginning his career in civil services, he taught Economics as a regular faculty member at St Stephens College (1963). Later, he joined the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) in 1964 and was assigned the State of Bihar. Following that, he has held the following positions: * Member, State Secretariat, Finance Department (1968‚Äì69) * Under Secretary, Ministry of Commerce (1969‚Äì73) * Special Assistant to Commerce Minister (1973‚Äì77) * Represented India at GATT, UNACTD, UN and the Common Wealth Secretariat. * Chairman, Bihar State Electricity Board * Special Assistant to the former President Pranab Mukherjee, then former Minister of Commerce, Steel and Mines (1980‚Äì81) * First Minister, Economic and Commercial, Indian Embassy, Japan (1981‚Äì85) * Additional Finance Commissioner, Principal Secretary Industries and Industrial Development Commissioner, Bihar (1986‚Äì90) * Joint Secretary Police (Ministry of Home Affairs) (1990‚Äì91) * Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (Ministry of Finance) (1991‚Äì93) * First Chairman UNGEF (United Nations Global Environment Facility) (1993‚Äì94) * Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (1993‚Äì95) * Secretary, Department of Expenditure (1995‚Äì96) * Revenue Secretary (1996‚Äì98) * Secretary to former PM AB Vajpayee (1998-2001) * Member Planning Commission (2001‚Äì06) * Deputy Chairman, Bihar State Planning Board (2006‚Äì08) * Member of Parliament to the Rajya Sabha (2008‚Äì14) Tax Reforms As Revenue Secretary (July 1996 ‚Äì August 1998), he oversaw the Dream Budget (1997‚Äì98), one of the most ambitious tax reforms so far. Tax rates were substantially reduced and personal Income Tax rates were brought down considerably from 15, 30 and 40 per cent to 10, 20 and 30 per cent. Similarly, corporate tax rates were also significantly reduced apart from simplifying and merging the widely varying customs and excise duty structure. Import tariffs were also slashed down to align India's import duties with other emerging markets. Moreover, a Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) was launched in the same year which enabled people to make voluntary disclosures given the benefits of lower tax rates. This enabled not only tax realisation of over $2 billion as hidden wealth of over Rs.33,000 crores or $10 billion being brought back to the economic stream. The VDIS scheme is considered a watershed and many have clamoured for its repetition both for domestic and foreign income. Task Force on Telecom He has also served as the Secretary, Task Force on Telecommunications and played a key role in placing a far-reaching reform on deregulation of India's Telecommunication sector. During his tenure, another major reform in the telecomm policy was to auction the spectrum bandwidth to the highest bidder. National Highway Development Project As PMO Secretary and Member Secretary of the Task Force on Infrastructure, N.K. Singh was instrumental in the planning of the 1300O KM National Highways Development Project (NHDP). Comprising the Golden Quadrilateral and the North-South and East-West corridors, it was one of the flagship scheme of the Indian Government and NHAI (National Highway Authority of India).http://nk.nksingh.com/DownloadableFiles/Putting%20India%20in%20the%20fast%20lane.pdf Career as a Member of Parliament Singh was elected as a Member of Parliament to the Rajya Sabha from Bihar in April 2008 representing the Janata Dal (United).

A previous manor house on the same site, in the parish of Great Bedwyn, was the seat of the Seymour family, a member of which, Jane Seymour, was queen to King Henry VIII. Late medieval and Tudor manor house Arms of Seymour: Gules, two wings conjoined in lure. The medieval manor house was probably a timber framed double courtyard house, incorporating two towers (demolished 1569), a long gallery, a chapel, and several other rooms. It was built in the early 1530s with financial assistance from Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII. The Seymours reached the peak of their influence in the 16th century, when Jane Seymour became the third wife of King Henry VIII. Her son became Edward VI and ruled England from 1547 to 1553. At the beginning of Edward's reign, he was nine years old and his eldest uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, was Lord High Protector of England, while another uncle, Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, married Henry VIII's widow, Catherine Parr. Both Edward and Thomas Seymour were eventually executed for treason. Henry VIII stayed at Wulfhall during his royal progress of 1535. This may have been when he first courted Jane Seymour, leading eventually to the decision to execute his second wife, Anne Boleyn, following her failure to produce a son and heir. There is a belief arising from the writing of 19th- century antiquary John Britton that Henry and Jane held a wedding feast in the Long Barn at Wulfhall.The Beauties of Wiltshire, Vol. 2, by John Britton. 1801 They were in fact married in the Queen's Closet at Whitehall Palace in London. Edward Seymour desired grander accommodation than Wulfhall could provide, and intended to replace the house with a new mansion on a nearby hill, Bedwyn Brail, with design and construction supervised by his steward, Sir John Thynne, founder of Longleat House. A correspondence survives, dated between November 1548 and June 1549, that shows Thynne directing the plans. The mansion was unfinished when Seymour fell from power, and was abandoned after his execution in January 1552. His son Edward was unable to maintain Wulfhall, which rapidly deteriorated. Wulfhall was \\"derelict and abandoned after 1571\\" as the family had relocated to nearby Tottenham Park. It was used as accommodation for servants until considerably reduced in size in the 1660s and demolished in 1723. A few ruins survived until the beginning of the 20th century, but nothing now remains above ground; the foundations were uncovered in a 2017‚Äì18 excavation. The barn where Henry and Jane supposedly held a feast to celebrate their marriage burnt down in the 1920s. Present manor house The present manor house dates back to the early 17th century, having started life as a simple farmhouse. It was expanded in the 18th century and has a Victorian fa√ßade. The current owners of the manor house are Dominic, Theo, Genevieve and Orlando Binney, who inherited the property on the death of their mother in 2013. Seven people live in the main house, which has been partitioned for tenants. In February 2015, Dominic Binney said, \\"Over the years we have had many people feeling a presence here that makes their hair stand on end - something that is definitely not explained by an old house's sounds and creaky floorboards. I've absolutely felt and heard unexplained things. We had mediums and psychics come here to chase the ghosts away.\\" A farm named Wolfhall remains on the site on a minor road leading away, East North East, from Burbage towards Crofton, where it crosses the Kennet and Avon Canal and railway. The farmhouse is from the late 16th century. In fiction Wulfhall is the inspiration for the title of Wolf Hall, the Man Booker Prize- winning novel by English author Hilary Mantel, as well as its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies, which also won the Man Booker Prize and begins with the 1535 arrival of the King at Wolf Hall.

It comprises a small hand pump that screws onto the top of a plastic soft drink bottle, which is used to pump air into the bottle. Pressurizing the bottle in this way, it is claimed by most of those who sell the device, prevents the drink from going flat. thumb As Joseph A. Schwarcz, Brian Rohrig (of Eastmoor Academy), John P. Williams (of Miami University Hamilton), Sandy Van Natta, Rebecca Knipp, and Reed A. Howald all explain, the mechanism does not, in fact, operate in this fashion because of Henry's Law and Dalton's Law. Description When a soft drink bottle is carbonated, it is pressurized with carbon dioxide to higher than the ambient atmospheric pressure. Eventually the dissolved CO2 and the CO2 in the headspace above the liquid reach a dynamic equilibrium, where the amount of CO2 dissolving in the liquid equals the amount of CO2 escaping the solution into the headspace, at a pressure of approximately 2 atmospheres. The bottle remains in this dynamic equilibrium until the first time that the cap is removed. The first time that the cap is removed from the bottle, the pressure inside the bottle equalizes with the ambient atmospheric pressure. More importantly, however, after the outside air is allowed to mix with the gas inside the bottle the headspace no longer contains pure CO2. Thus the partial pressure of CO2 is substantially reduced, from 2 atmospheres to the partial pressure of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, which is approximately 0.0003 atmospheres. In accordance with Henry's Law, the excess CO2 dissolved in the drink comes out of solution. Eventually it reaches a new dynamic equilibrium state, with a much lower partial pressure of CO2 in the headspace and thus a much lower amount of CO2 held in solution. Pumping pure CO2 back into the bottle would raise that partial pressure, and force more CO2 back into solution. The Fizz Keeper, however, only pumps the normal atmospheric mixture of gases into the bottle, which (by Dalton's Law) does not raise the partial pressure of CO2 far above 0.0003 atmospheres, since only part of the overall increase in pressure within the bottle is attributable to CO2. Hence little to no CO2 goes back into solution and effectively none of the \\"fizz\\" is actually returned (since the amount of additional CO2 that dissolves once more is several orders of magnitude lower than the amount that caused visible gas bubbles to form when first escaping the solution). It takes time for the dissolved CO2 to come out of solution, in the form of gas bubbles that grow and bubble up within the liquid. Thus if the cap is replaced quickly after opening, an intermediate equilibrium state can be maintained, with CO2 previously dissolved in the liquid instead occupying the headspace. However, the CO2 partial pressure only ever decreases on each opening, as more of the gas escapes from the bottle entirely. The Fizz Keeper does not cause that partial pressure to increase significantly. Rohrig also observes from experiment that the Fizz Keeper forms a poorer seal than the bottle's own screw cap, thus allowing CO2 to leak out, and the CO2 partial pressure to decrease, more quickly with the Fizz Keeper on a bottle than with the normal cap. Although re-pressurizing the bottle with an ordinary atmospheric mixture of gases does not affect the equilibrium state, because it only slightly changes the CO2 partial pressure in the headspace, it does affect the kinetics of how that equilibrium state is reached. The increased overall pressure slows down the rate at which dissolved CO2 comes out of solution. For a few hours the bottle's contents are not in an equilibrium state. The application of the Fizz Keeper extends this period, but by hours not by days. Rohrig reports that this can be and has been easily confirmed by experiment. The first Fizz Keeper-like device was patented in 1926 by G. Staunton. T.R. Robinson and M.B. Beyer patented the Fizz Keeper itself in 1988, without claiming in the patent that the device maintained a soft drink's \\"fizz\\". Several styles of device exist, from the plain piston pump to devices incorporating a bulb and a latch and hinge device to allow liquid to be poured out of a spout without removing the Fizz Keeper from the bottle. Although the Fizz Keeper does not operate as advertised, it has documented uses as a home science tool and teaching aid, for experimentation in physics. Rohrig has published a book of science experiments that can be performed with the Fizz Keeper. More experiments have been published by Moloney, Spangler, Graham, and Williams et al.

The hop count between the computers in this case is 2. In wired computer networking, including the Internet, a hop occurs when a packet is passed from one network segment to the next. Data packets pass through routers as they travel between source and destination. The hop count refers to the number of intermediate devices through which data must pass between source and destination. Since store and forward and other latencies are incurred through each hop, a large number of hops between source and destination implies lower real-time performance.  Hop count  In wired networks, the hop count refers to the number of intermediate network devices through which data must pass between source and destination. Hop count is a rough measure of distance between two hosts. A hop count of n means that n network devices separate the source host from the destination host. On a layer 3 network such as Internet Protocol (IP), each router along the data path constitutes a hop. By itself, this metric is, however, not useful for determining the optimum network path, as it does not take into consideration the speed, load, reliability, or latency of any particular hop, but merely the total count. Nevertheless, some routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP), use hop count as their sole metric.RFC 1058, Routing Information Protocol, C. Hendrik, The Internet Society (June 1988) Each time a router receives a packet, it modifies the packet, decrementing the time to live (TTL). The router discards any packets received with a zero TTL value. This prevents packets from endlessly bouncing around the network in the event of routing errors. Routers are capable of managing hop counts, but other types of network devices (e.g. Ethernet hubs and bridges) are not.  Hop limit  Known as time to live (TTL) in IPv4, and hop limit in IPv6, this field specifies a limit on the number of hops a packet is allowed before being discarded. Routers modify IP packets as they are forwarded, decrementing the respective TTL or hop limit fields. Routers do not forward packets with a resultant field of 0 or less. This prevents packets from following a loop forever.  Next hop  When configuring network devices the hop may refer to next hop.. Next hop is the next gateway to which packets should be forwarded along the path to their final destination. A routing table usually contains the IP address of a destination network and the IP address of the next gateway along the path to the final network destination. By only storing next-hop information, next-hop routing or next-hop forwarding reduces the size of routing tables. A given gateway only knows one step along the path, not the complete path to a destination. It is also key to know that the next hops listed in a routing table are on networks to which the gateway is directly connected . Diagnostics The traceroute command can be used to measure the number of router hops from one host to another. Hop counts are often useful to find faults in a network or to discover if routing is indeed correct. Wireless ad hoc networking In a wireless ad hoc network, commonly, every participating node is also acting as a router. This means that the terms \\"hop\\" and \\"hop count\\" are often the subject of confusion. Often, the sending node is simply counted as the first hop, thus yielding the same number for \\"hops\\" for both interpretations of \\"hop\\" as \\"traversed routers\\" and \\"jumps from node to node\\". For example, RFC 6130 defines a \\"1-hop neighbor\\" as any other node that is directly reachable via the wireless interface.

Plot The four couples prepare for their next marriage retreat in the Bahamas. Sheila (Jill Scott) and her new husband, Troy (Lamman Rucker), are the first to arrive, followed (in order) by Patricia (Janet Jackson) and Gavin (Malik Yoba), Terry (Tyler Perry) and Dianne (Sharon Leal), and Angela (Tasha Smith) and Marcus (Michael Jai White). The men and the women separate to talk about the good and bad about their marriages. In a surprising twist, Sheila's ex-husband, Mike (Richard T. Jones), arrives, and Angela immediately starts a fight until he leaves the women alone to go see the guys. That night, he talks about his and Sheila's relationship, which angers Troy. Dianne accidentally calls Terry \\"Phil\\" in the course of conversation. Angela is insistent about getting the password to Marcus' cell phone because she distrusts him, but Marcus distracts her using sex. Dianne and Terry hear arguing later and think it's Angela and Marcus, but it turns out to be Patricia and Gavin. When Dianne goes to investigate, she finds Patricia but cannot get her to tell her what's wrong. The next morning, Sheila makes it clear that, though Mike says he misses her, she is completely over him. At the beach, the women meet an elderly couple (Louis Gosset, Jr. and Cicely Tyson) who have accidentally thrown a friend's ashes on Angela. Sheila invites them to dinner and they accept. At the \\"Why Did I Get Married?\\" ceremony, Patricia announces to the group that she and Gavin are getting a divorce, causing a distraught and angered Gavin to walk away from her, because he did not know she was going to announce it to them. Back in Atlanta, Gavin and his lawyer meet Patricia with her lawyer, Dianne. Patricia and Gavin have decided to split everything down the middle in the settlement, but Gavin reveals that Patricia has not offered up the account containing her $850,000 book revenue. Patricia refuses to give Gavin any of her book money, but as she leaves, Gavin advises Dianne to tell Patricia to \\"prepare for a fight\\", as he intends to get half of that account as well. Meanwhile, Angela's neighbor tells her she's been hearing sexual noises from the house when Angela is not home. Angela believes Marcus is cheating and confronts him live on his television show, who then gives her his cell phone and password. Gavin comes home very drunk and confronts Patricia. He takes their son's baby photos and taunts her about her perceived lack of emotions, even about their divorce and their son's death, and then assaults her, douses her in vodka, then burns the photos. Elsewhere, at Sheila's request, Mike agrees to help find Troy a job. Angela lectures Dianne and Sheila about how all men cheat. Patricia changes the locks and catches Gavin, Terry, and Marcus moving Gavin's things out, then learns Gavin has taken all their money, including her book money; enraged, Patricia trashes the house with his golf clubs. Angela comes home early to catch Marcus cheating and finds a couple in her bed, but after shooting up the room, she notices it was just the gardener and the maid having sex. Terry finally confronts Dianne about her infidelity; she reveals that she has been having an emotional affair and begs for forgiveness. Marcus and Angela fight, then reconcile, but only to fight again after Angela discovers Marcus has another phone. Troy arrives at Mike's apartment after finding out Mike got him his police job. After finding Sheila there, he angrily attacks Mike. Sheila tearfully confesses that she has been taking Mike to chemotherapy; she tries to apologize for being dishonest, but he leaves her. The women go to Patricia's house to comfort her; they soon realize that they are ruining their marriages and lives with their constant selfishness, lies, dishonesty and inconsideration. The next day, Troy, himself, apologizes to Mike for the incident, who forgives him and invites Troy to have a drink with him and the guys, beginning a new friendship. Mike tells the men to fix their marriages because life is too short. The following day, Gavin finds himself humiliated at his job, harassed, and told off by an angry Patricia; to make matters worse, he is then struck and gravely injured by an oncoming truck. While the others wait to hear the status of his condition, a tearful and regretful Patricia instructs the wives to fix their marriages (such as Mike suggested to the husbands), and everyone makes up. Gavin's doctor shows up and informs them that he has died. The couples decided to have a memorial service for Gavin in the Bahamas. One year later, as Patricia exits a university building she is approached by a colleague. She tells Patricia that she knows someone who wants to meet her, a philanthropist, but Patricia refuses. The professor goes on to tell her that she can at least say hi because the university needs funds. The man (Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson) tells her that her books have helped in his grieving process (divorce) and invites her to have coffee. The movie ends with Patricia smiling at him.

His writings in the fields of Christian dogmatics, ethics, and history have had great influence on modern Christianity in general and modern Lutheranism in particular.  Biography  Elert was born on 19 August 1885 in the town of Heldrungen in the Prussian Province of Saxony (present-day Thuringia), but he grew up in northern Germany.For his early years, see Elert's entry in the \\"Golden Book\\" of the University of Erlangen (5 January 1927), summarized by Kaufmann, 236-238. See also Sparn, 159f., and Keller and Roth, 9-10. The Elert family had originally come from Rarfin in Pomerania, near Kolberg on the Baltic Sea.Green, 231. They belonged to the \\"Old Lutherans\\" who had rejected the 1817 Prussian Union of Churches. Elert's parents were August Elert and Friederike, n√©e Graf, Elert.Elert, Rudolf Rocholls Philosophie der Geschichte, 139. After attending the Realgymnasium in Harburg and the Gymnasium in Husum, he studied theology, philosophy, history, German literature, psychology and law in Breslau, Erlangen, and Leipzig. Becker, 97. He earned doctorates in philosophy and theology at Erlangen.Becker, 97-98. After working as a tutor for a short time in Livonia, he served as a pastor from 1912 to 1919 in Seefeld, Pomerania.Becker, 98. During World War I he served as a military chaplain on several fronts.Beyschlag, 152. In 1919 Elert became director of the Old-Lutheran Theological Seminary in Breslau.Becker, 98. In 1923 he was appointed to the chair of church history at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen (now called the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg). With the death of Philip Bachman in 1932, he was appointed to the chair of systematic theology.Keller and Roth, 11. In the academic year 1926/27 he was elected rector of the University, and in 1928-29 and 1935-43 he served as the dean of the theological faculty.Becker, 100. Throughout his years in Erlangen, he was active in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria.Rudolf Keller, \\"Erinnerung an Werner Elert, Journal of the Martin Luther Bund 26 (1979), 9-26; cf. Green, 235. Elert frequently participated in ecumenical meetings, including the first World Lutheran Conference (where he delivered a paper) and the Second Assembly of the Lutheran World Federation in 1952.Becker, 99. In 1927 he gave a major address (\\"The Call to Unity\\") at the Lausanne Conference, the first meeting of the \\"Faith and Order\\" ecumenical movement.Becker, 100. Elert retired in 1953. He died in Erlangen on November 19, 1954 in his 70th year, due to complications from stomach cancer.Green, 261-62. In 1912 Elert married Annemarie (n√©e Frob√∂ss, b. 1892), who was the daughter of church official Georg Frob√∂ss. They had three children: two sons, both of whom died on the Eastern front in World War II, and one daughter, who later married a Lutheran pastor.Keller and Roth, 11. The Elert house in Erlangen (Hindenburgstrasse 44) is now a study center for theology students (\\"Werner- Elert-House\\") that is owned by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria.Green, 263.  Theological Work  Elert's scholarly life can be divided into five periods.Becker, 101. In the first of these periods (1910-21), he devoted himself to the philosophy of history and to a defense of the Christian faith vis-a-vis modern philosophy and theology. In the second period (1922-32), he worked on a two-volume study of Lutheranism. The third period (1932-40), which coincided with the regime of Adolf Hitler, was devoted to issues in dogmatics and matters of church and state. The fourth period (1940-49) was marked by his study of Lutheran ethics. In the final period of his life (1950-54), he worked on issues in the history of Christian dogma, particularly relating to Eastern Orthodox christology and eucharistic fellowship. His first major work, Der Kampf um das Christentum [the struggle over Christianity], published in 1921, offers a critique of the synthesis that developed in the nineteenth century between liberal Protestant theology (especially through the influence of Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel, and Friedrich Schleiermacher) and modern German \\"culture\\" (Kultur). As such, the book provides a critical perspective on these thinkers as well as many others.Following the publication of this book, Elert was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Greifswald. Cf. Becker, 102. In Elert's view, modern theology must return to an independent position that maintains its critical distance from all influences that are foreign to the biblical witness to Jesus Christ. Elert was convinced that modern Western culture is in a state of decline (cf. Oswald Spengler) and stands under the judgment of God. The final outcome of any attempt to maintain a synthesis between Christian theology and modern culture \\"would be the death of the former.\\"Elert, Der Kampf um das Christentum, 3. \\"Only when Christianity becomes entirely separate again for a moment, i.e., entirely free from the present 'culture,' will it demonstrate its power for producing a new thing, something it has done more than once in its history.\\" Elert, Der Kampf, 490, as translated by Becker, 103. Christian theology will only flourish when it maintains its \\"diastasis\\" from modernity.Elert, Der Kampf, 3. If Christianity is not disentangled \\"from a decaying culture,\\" it will be \\"dragged down into the whirlpool.\\"Elert, Der Kampf, 489. Following earlier theologians in the Erlangen tradition (e.g., F. H. R. Frank, Ludwig Ihmels), Elert stressed the importance of understanding the connection between the historic biblical witness to Christ and the immediacy and \\"certainty\\" of the individual Christian's faith in God through the gospel.Keller and Roth, 16; Becker, 103. Elert's call for the \\"diastasis\\" of Christianity from modern thought also impacted some of his later writings. For example, in his Morphologie des Luthertums [the structure of Lutheranism], he presupposed a confessional \\"dynamism\\" of Lutheranism, \\"which, as a basic structural fact, is given to the historical changes themselves.‚ÄùKaufman, 216. In his final, unfinished work on the christology of Theodore of Pharan, Elert highlighted the relationship between the dogma of the ancient church and the biblical image of Christ in order to show, contrary to the thesis of Adolph von Harnack, that Christian dogma is not the foreign intrusion of Greek metaphysics into the original gospel, but rather it is a necessary \\"given,\\" grounded in the gospel and liturgical witness to Christ.Elert, Der Ausgang der Altkirchlichen Christologie, 12-24. The second period of Elert's scholarly work began with the research and writing of a brief outline of Lutheran teaching.Elert, Die Lehre des Luthertums im Abriss (Munich: Beck, 1924). Two years after the publication of the first edition, this little exercise in Lutheran systematic theology was revised and expanded.Green, 235. Part One of the book (\\"The Struggle with God\\") describes the human experience of freedom and fate [Schicksal], in which the latter concept refers to \\"the product of all the factors which shape our lives, other than the will to be free\\".Elert, Die Lehre des Luthertums, 2d ed., 4. Here, Elert stresses the fundamental opposition between God and humanity, which is experienced by human beings as a limitation to their knowledge, as an awareness of their moral failure before God (their guilt), and the fear of death.Becker, 105. This first part of the book ends by summarizing biblical teaching about the law of God, the hidden God (deus absconditus), and God's wrath against sin. Part Two (\\"Reconciliation\\") sets forth the Christian teaching of the good news about Jesus Christ, the redeemer. While the law of God is experienced by all human beings, even apart from the Christian message, the gospel is received by hearing the biblical promise of God's forgiveness in Christ and by trusting it in faith.Elert, Die Lehre des Luthertums, 40. Part Three (\\"Freedom\\") offers a brief description of Lutheran ethics, in which the forgiven sinner lives out his or her \\"new life in Christ\\" in responsible freedom within the various \\"orders\\" in creation (i.e., in one's family, in civil society, through art/culture, through knowledge and education, and in business).Elert, Die Lehre des Luthertums, 82f. Elert's most important and influential work was also produced in this period: his two-volume, 1000-page study of \\"the structure of Lutheranism.\\"Cf. Green, 235; Becker, 106. The first volume presents a historical trajectory of key Lutheran teachings, the central one of which is the proper distinction between law and gospel. Elert called this central theme the \\"evangelischer Ansatz,\\" the \\"gospel point of departure\\" or the \\"gospel entry point.\\"Becker, 106. He also called it \\"the confessional constant,\\" which he found to be \\"effective\\" through all the historical changes of Lutheranism, a constant \\"that is operative beyond individual connections and, as a dominant force, either determines or helps determine the outcome.\\"Elert, The Structure of Lutheranism, 1.5. As he traced this historical dynamic, he judged that the \\"evangelischer Ansatz\\" had been strongest in Luther's theology, was properly developed in the Augsburg Confession and its Apology, was partly strengthened and partly weakened in the writings of Philip Melanchthon, was partly renewed and partly distorted in Formula_of_Concord, and was significantly distorted in the periods of Lutheran Orthodoxy, Pietism, and Rationalism.Becker, 107. The second volume follows the same historical trajectory from the sixteenth century to the early twentieth century, but this time Elert focuses on the social teachings and social consequences of Lutheranism. During the 1930s, Elert worked on developing the principles for a contemporary-Lutheran, systematic summary of Christian teaching. This work, which began with his assumption of the chair in systematic theology at Erlangen in 1932, culminated in the publication of his 700-page Der christliche Glaube [Christian Dogmatics] in 1940.Becker, 110. His colleague, Paul Althaus, deemed this book \\"the first great contradiction... against the theology of Karl Barth from the Lutheran side.\\"Althaus, \\"Werner Elert's theologische Werke,\\" in Gedenkschrift f√ºr D. Werner Elert,\\" 406. The purpose of dogmatics, according to Elert, is to find within the normative content of biblical proclamation that point at which it \\"confronts contemporary human beings most immediately with the reality of its subject matter,\\" and to ward off misunderstandings.Elert, Der christliche Glaube, 3rd ed., 30; cf. Becker, 118; and Michael Roth, \\"Hermeneut der Gegenwart? Werner Elerts Versuch, 'mit dem Gegewartsmenschen zu verhandeln,\\" in Keller and Roth, 155f. The distinction between law and gospel is the organizing principle of the work as a whole.Becker, 119 This principle was the decisive issue in Elert's criticism of Barth's theology and the Barmen Declaration.Becker, 113. In Elert's view, the latter lacks a proper understanding of the revelation of God's law.Thiemann, 52, 54, 58. Whereas the Barmen Declaration states that \\"Jesus Christ... is the one Word of God whom we must hear and to whom we must give trust and obedience in life and in death,\\" Elert stressed that God always addresses every human being in two words, law and gospel, and that these two words are qualitatively different from each other.Keller and Roth, 13; Becker, 113-114. Over against Barth's essay, \\"Gospel and Law,\\"Karl Barth, \\"Gospel and Law,\\" in Community, State and Churc, (New York: Doubleday, 1960), 71-100. Elert argued that we must first understand that we stand under God's law before we can hear and trust the gospel aright, yet nowhere \\"in the Barmen theses is there a word about God's law. God's law is ignored--one can hardly express it otherwise.\\"Elert, Law and Gospel, 4. In the year after Elert wrote his essay on \\"law and gospel,\\" he published the last of his large books, Das christliche Ethos [The Christian Ethos]. This 595-page book, which is also guided by the real dialectic between law and gospel, describes \\"the ethos\\" under God's law (whereby God is experienced and revealed as creator, preserver, and judge) and \\"the ethos\\" under God's grace (whereby faith trusts that God has reconciled the sinner through Christ). Each \\"ethos\\" results from the very different verdicts that God renders \\"under law\\" and \\"under grace.\\"Becker, 121. Thus, Christian ethics \\"must approach its subject\\" from these two differing verdicts of God.Elert, The Christian Ethos, 15 In the final years of his life, Elert turned his attention to issues in the history of dogma, particularly in the areas of christology and eucharistic fellowship. Over against tendencies in the early church to understand christology in terms of the Neo-Platonic dualism of the finite and the infinite and of the concept of Christ as a political king, \\"Elert advocated turning from the dogma about Christ, and its controversies, to the portraiture of Christ found in the four Gospels.\\"Green, 237.  Elert's relationship to National Socialism and the Aryan Paragraph  Prior to 1933, Elert had been a constitutional monarchist.Becker, 110. \\"I was reared in the fear of God, thriftiness, and affirmation of the state.\\"Elert, \\"Lebensbeschreibung\\" [biography], in the archives of the theology faculty at Erlangen University, cited by Green, 232. While he was never a member of the Nazi Party, he did support the rise of Hitler.Green, 241; Becker, 110. That support took place in the wake of the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II and in view of the social, political, and economic crises of the Weimar era. On June 11, 1934, he signed the \\"Ansbach Counsel,\\" which included a pledge of obedience to the Leader.Becker, 113. A short time later, however, Elert withdrew from the group that had produced this document since the group became associated with the program of the \\"German Christians\\" who were seeking to change the Evangelical Church in Germany to fit with Nazi ideals. Cf. Beyschlag, 170; Klaus Scholder, The Churches and the Third Reich, 2 vols. (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1988), 2.252. In September 1933 Elert and his colleague, Paul Althaus, published their opinion about the Aryan Paragraph.Paul Althaus and Werner Elert, \\"Theologische Gutachten √ºber die Zulassung von Christen j√ºduischer Herkunft zu den √Ñmtern der deutschen evangelischen Kirche,\\" Junge Kirche 1 (1933), 271-74. According to this opinion, the Evangelical Church in Germany, for the time being, should obey the government and limit its offices to non-Jews, even though Christians of Jewish descent remain full members of the church because of their baptism.Althaus and Elert, \\"Theologische Gutachten,\\" 273-74; cf. Becker, 111. While supporting the government's law, Elert and Althaus did offer a caution: \\"It offends the nature of the ministry, of ordination, and of the pastoral call, if the church should as a general practice dismiss from its service all clergy of Jewish or half-Jewish descent, who have proved themselves in their ministry, solely on account of their descent. It's not... that their remaining in the pastoral office, but rather their dismissal, requires a special reason from case to case.\\"Althaus and Elert, \\"Theologische Gutachten,\\" as translated and quoted by Green, 248. While Elert expressed his reservations about the Nazi regime privately, he continued, as a state employee, to pretend to support the regime publicly during his deanship.Green, 241-42. \\"Although he actively worked against the infiltration of Nazism and the Deutsche Christen\\" in the Erlangen theology faculty, \\"he remained silent in the face of other anti-Semitic actions on the part of the Nazis. While he may have been privately critical of Hitler, his understanding and application of Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2, and his understanding of the orders of creation, prevented him from openly criticizing\\" the regime.Becker, 116. Eventually, in 1943, the Nazis removed him from being dean of the theology faculty, when they realized that he had been acting contrary to Nazi policies.cf. Elert's August 1945 report on his long deanship (1935-1943) to Paul Althaus, in Beyschlag, 266-67; Cf. Green, 238, 241, and Becker, 111-12. For example, as dean, he had kept the theology faculty free of Nazi-Party members and \\"German Christians\\" (Deutsche Christen), and, \\"at great personal risk\\" vis-a-vis the Gestapo, he had helped to shield at least forty students who should have been expelled from the university because of their Jewish descent or political views.Beyschlag, 161; cf. Elert's August 1945 \\"Report\\" to Althaus, in Beyschlag, 279-80; cf. Becker, 116; Green, 241. Following two investigations by the American military in 1945 and 1946, Elert and his colleagues in the theology faculty were officially cleared to resume their teaching and scholarly work.Green, 233. In a report that Elert prepared sometime before August 1946, he explained his position on National Socialism.Werner Elert, \\"Prof. D. Dr. Elert √ºber seine Stellung zum Nationalsozialismus,\\" Archive of the Theological Faculty, Erlangen University, cf. Green, 239. Near the end of this report, he stated, \\"I have had to pay with the blood of my sons for the blood-guilt that Hitler and his people brought over our entire people. I do not need to say what I think about the war criminals. I am convinced that, together with Nazi ideology, also the whole spirit of militarism must be eliminated from our people.\\"Elert, \\"Prof. D. Dr. Elert √ºber seine Stellung zum Nationalsozialismus,\\" as translated and quoted by Green, 245. After the war, Elert joined a liberal-democratic political party.Wolfgang Trillhaas, ‚ÄúKonservative Theologie und moderne Welt: Erinnerung an Werner Elert,‚Äù Jahrbuch des Martin Luther-Bundes 33 (1986), 44.

Hamilton, 110 U.S. 108 (1884), was an Implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose lawsuit which took place in 1884.discussion  Background  The company Kellogg Bridge Co. undertook to construct for the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Company an iron bridge across Maumee River at Toledo, Ohio. After doing a portion of the work it entered into a written contract with Hamilton (a subcontractor) for the completion of the bridge. The bridge was put up in several spans and in order to support the spans, falsework, consisting of piles driven in the river between the piers upon which the spans were to rest, was needed. The Bridge Company had previously constructed a part of the falsework involved in between the first and second spans, which Hamilton paid for as he had agreed to do. A part of the falsework put up by the company sank under the weight of the first span and was replaced by Hamilton. When the second fixed span was about two- thirds complete, ice in the river broke up due to a flood and the falsework was carried away causing the whole of the iron material in place on that span to fall into the river. If the piles had been driven in more firmly, they would have withstood the force of the ice and the flood. Hamilton was subject to delay of the completion of the bridge and increased expense. Hamilton brought suit in the State court to recover the contract price of the bridge, extra claimed to be done on it, and the damages sustained by the insufficiency of the false work constructed by the Bridge Company for $3,693.78. On diversity jurisdiction, the cause was removed to the Circuit Court of the US where the Bridge Company answered with a counterclaim for $6,619.70. The trial ended with a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $3,039.89. The defendant brought a writ of error to reverse that judgment. The case came to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The court said that under the circumstances, the buyer had the right to rely and necessarily relied on the judgment of the seller and not upon his own. In ordinary circumstances, the buyer has the opportunity to inspect the article sold and the seller is not the maker, so they stand on equal grounds of ignorance. But when the seller is the manufacturer, the fair presumption is that he understood the process of its manufacture and was cognizant of any latent defect caused by such process and which reasonable diligence might have prevented.

Set in the period from 1500 to 1535, Wolf Hall is a sympathetic fictionalised biography documenting the rapid rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII through to the death of Sir Thomas More. The novel won both the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2012, The Observer named it as one of \\"The 10 best historical novels\\". The book is the first in a trilogy; the sequel Bring Up the Bodies was published in 2012. The last book in the trilogy is The Mirror and the Light (2020), which covers the last four years of Cromwell's life. Historical background Born to a working-class family of no position or name, Cromwell rose to become the right-hand man of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, adviser to the King. He survived Wolsey's fall from grace to eventually take his place as the most powerful of Henry's ministers. In that role he observed turning points of English history, as Henry asserted his authority to declare his marriage annulled from Catherine of Aragon, married Anne Boleyn, broke from Rome, established the independence of the Church of England, and called for the dissolution of the monasteries. The novel is a reenvisioning of historical and literary records; in Robert Bolt's play A Man for All Seasons Cromwell is portrayed as the calculating, unprincipled opposite of Thomas More's honour and rectitude. Mantel's novel offers an alternative to that portrayal, an intimate portrait of Cromwell as a tolerant, pragmatic, and talented man attempting to serve King, country, and family amid the political machinations of Henry's court and the religious upheavals of the Reformation, in contrast to More's viciously punitive adherence to the old Roman Catholic order that Henry is sweeping away. Process Mantel said she spent five years researching and writing the book, trying to match her fiction to the historical record. To avoid contradicting history she created a card catalogue, organised alphabetically by character, with each card containing notes indicating where a particular historical figure was on relevant dates. \\"You really need to know, where is the Duke of Suffolk at the moment? You can't have him in London if he's supposed to be somewhere else,\\" she explained. In an interview with The Guardian, Mantel stated her aim to place the reader in \\"that time and that place, putting you into Henry's entourage. The essence of the thing is not to judge with hindsight, not to pass judgment from the lofty perch of the 21st century when we know what happened. It's to be there with them in that hunting party at Wolf Hall, moving forward with imperfect information and perhaps wrong expectations, but in any case moving forward into a future that is not predetermined, but where chance and hazard will play a terrific role.\\" Characters Wolf Hall includes a large cast of fictionalised historical persons. In addition to those already mentioned, prominent characters include: * Stephen Gardiner, Master Secretary to King Henry * Princess Mary, the daughter and only surviving child of Henry and Catherine, later Queen Mary I of England. * Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne * Thomas Boleyn, father of Anne and Mary * Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Anne's uncle * Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury * Jane Seymour, who later became the third of Henry's six wives * Rafe Sadler, Thomas Cromwell's ward Title The title comes from the name of the Seymour family seat at Wolfhall or Wulfhall in Wiltshire; the title's allusion to the old Latin saying Homo homini lupus (\\"Man is wolf to man\\") serves as a constant reminder of the dangerously opportunistic nature of the world through which Cromwell navigates. Critical reaction  * A poll of literary experts by the Independent Bath Literature Festival voted Wolf Hall the greatest novel from 1995-2015. It also ranked third in a BBC Culture poll of the best novels since 2000. In 2019, The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century ranked Wolf Hall first. Awards and nominations * Winner ‚Äì 2009 Man Booker Prize. James Naughtie, the chairman of the Booker prize judges, said the decision to give Wolf Hall the award was \\"based on the sheer bigness of the book. The boldness of its narrative, its scene setting...The extraordinary way that Hilary Mantel has created what one of the judges has said was a contemporary novel, a modern novel, which happens to be set in the 16th century\\". * Winner ‚Äì 2009 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. * Winner ‚Äì 2010 Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction. * Winner ‚Äì 2010 The Morning News Tournament of Books. *Winner ‚Äì 2010 Audie Award for Literary Fiction for the audiobook narrated by Simon Slater *Winner ‚Äì 2010 AudioFile magazine Earphone Award for the audiobook narrated by Simon Slater AdaptationsStage= In January 2013, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) announced it would stage adaptations by Mike Poulton of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies in its Winter season. The production transferred to London's Aldwych Theatre in May 2014, for a limited run until October. Producers Jeffrey Richards and Jerry Frankel brought the London productions of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, starring Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell; Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn; Lucy Briers as Katherine of Aragon; and Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII, to Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre in March 2015 for a 15-week run. The double-bill has been re-titled Wolf Hall, Parts 1 and 2 for American audiences. The play was nominated for 8 Tony Awards, including Best Play. =Television= In 2012, the BBC announced it would adapt Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies for BBC Two, for broadcast in 2015. On 8 March 2013, the BBC announced Mark Rylance had been cast as Thomas Cromwell. The first episode was broadcast in the United States on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre, on 5 April 2015.

McNulta, 147 U.S. 238 (1893), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a person should not receive compensation for injuries sustained when he is experienced in his work and there is no evidence of negligence or extenuating circumstances.  Background  Kohn began working as a switchman for McNulta, the receiver (buyer) of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company on April 29, 1887. On July 11, Kohn‚Äôs arm was crushed while trying to couple two freight cars in the Toledo, Ohio railyard. Kohn filed his petition of intervention in the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Ohio, the court which had appointed McNulta the receiver. At first, his intervening petition was referred to a master, but afterward, on his motion, the order of reference was set aside and a jury called in. The court left to the jury the single question of the amount of damages that the intervenor should recover if entitled to recover anything. The jury responded $10,000. The court found that no cause of action was made out against the receiver, set aside the verdict of the jury, and dismissed the petition. The intervenor appealed to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The Court held that a person should not receive compensation for injuries sustained when he is experienced in his work and there is no evidence of negligence or extenuating circumstances. Kohn had argued that the Company was negligent in exposing Kohn to cars that were different from the ones he was used to handling. The Court disagreed, reasoning that he was a mature and experienced man who should have been able to cope with the existing conditions. The train cars were not in defective in any way, they had the double deadwoods or bumpers of unusual length and were constructed differently, but this should have been obvious even at a passing glance. Kohn had already been working there for two months, long enough to know the risks.  See also  * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 147 * Lavender v.

She is remembered as the wife of Sir Walter Stonor, and was one of the women chosen to serve Anne Boleyn, the king's second wife, during her imprisonment in 1536.

It is a brick building constructed in the early 20th century, the only extant fire house of the six engine companies that once protected the city. It was designed by local architect Percival M. Lloyd in a late application of the Gothic Revival architectural style. In 1982 it, along with two other old Poughkeepsie firehouses, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The firehouse is a brick building three stories high with three to five bays in each story. The front facade faces east. Beneath the flat roof is a projecting cornice and brick frieze with blue squares on which \\"Niagara\\" is spelled out. It is supported by large brackets alternating with smaller ones. Fenestration is varied. The third-story windows have pointed arches. The central window on the story below is a projecting bay window with a castellated top and diamond-shaped lights. Above the first story is a molded stone cornice with letters spelling out \\"1810 NIAGARA 1909\\". A stone course separates the first and second stories. Brick pilasters frame the main garage door. The interior retains its tiled floor, brass pole and flooring. History The engine company that became Niagara was organized in 1810, as the building facade suggests, but did not start going by that name until 1847. Six engine companies are known to have been in service during the city's history. This is the only one whose building is extant. In 1909 local architect Percival M. Lloyd, who had earlier designed the eclectic Lady Washington Hose Company building a few blocks to the south on Academy Street, was hired to build the new one. His building includes many features of the Gothic Revival II style, which was used for many public buildings in the early 20th century ... the projecting central bay, roof castellation, stone lintels with drip molding and arches, the stone course between the two lower floors and a mock stone basement at ground level. A private ambulance company moved into the lower floor after the fire department left the building. They left its features intact.

The first production from the People‚Äôs Republic of China ever to appear on Broadway,Official website its story is told through a display of Chinese martial arts, particularly Shaolin Kung Fu, handed down through generations in the Shaolin Monastery, a Ch√°n Buddhist temple at Song Shan near Dengfeng in China. Plot The primary focus is on Hui Guang, who as an infant was separated from his mother when she hid him, together with a broken piece of jade identifying his origin, during a period of civil conflict. Discovered by Na Luo, the baby is brought to the temple and raised by the monks who live there. His education includes instruction in the ways of Shaolin Kung Fu and the daily practice of Kung Fu skills. In later years, Hui Guang encounters his mother, now begging on the streets to support herself, being molested by a gang of men. In the ensuing struggle to rescue her, he drops the piece of jade, which she recognizes and pockets. Hoping to find her son, she sneaks into the forest on the temple grounds, where she is captured by Hui Guang. Following an interrogation, it becomes clear who she is. Her request to take her son with her is denied by the abbot, who declares if Hui Gang wants to leave the temple, he must fight his way out, according to the rules require. He does so, and mother and son finally are reunited. Production Soul of Shaolin originally was presented at the 2008 Summer Olympics as part of the Beijing arts festival.New York Times review Following three previews, the Broadway production officially opened at the Marquis Theatre on January 15, 2009 and ran for 21 performances. Featuring the Shaolin Temple Wushu Martial Artists, it was directed and choreographed by Liu Tongbiao and starred Yu Fei as Hui Guang as a young man, Zhang Zhigang as Na Luo, Wang Yazhi as Hui Guang's mother, and Bai Guojun as the abbot. The Broadway production has been nominated for the Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event and the Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience. A North American tour of the production is scheduled to commence in Fall 2010. Critical reception Charles Isherwood of the New York Times observed, \\"The three performers who play the main character, Hui Guang, impress with their contortionist feats and physical prowess . . . The splashy all-monks-on-deck numbers combine the pop of a Broadway dance routine with the testosteroney thrill of Hong Kong action movies. But Soul of Shaolin ultimately seems a pretty cheap enterprise. The sets are mostly painted flats, and the music . . . is recorded. Much of it is schlocky; for long stretches it sounds as if someone loaded up the world‚Äôs most bombastic movie soundtracks on an iPod and then pressed the shuffle button. The passages of more relaxed indigenous music come as a big relief. Unfortunately for the makers of Soul of Shaolin . . . the innumerable Cirque du Soleil shows have set a far higher standard in terms of stagecraft . . . I seriously doubt Soul of Shaolin represents the best of Chinese culture.\\" Sam Thielman of Variety called the production \\"a rushed, expertly trained assault that leaves you slightly confused afterward\\" and \\"a little weak on storytelling and variety.\\" He added, \\"In the rare instances when the show communicates with utter clarity, it succeeds by speaking a universal language of one-upmanship and pratfalls . . . At the end of the day, however, you can get more precision from The Rockettes and you can get smarter Chinese action-comedy from a Stephen Chow movie. Soul of Shaolin isn't a failure, exactly, but it doesn't hit its target often enough to be a success, either.\\" Variety review Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News rated it two out of five stars and commented, \\"To borrow from A Chorus Line, Shaolin rates as follows - Martial arts: 10. Magic: 3 . . . Some kung-fu moves will make your head spin. When these performers launch into the air and whirl nearly horizontal to the ground, it's no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon special effect. Unfortunately, cheesy sets and choppy staging choices undermine the highs. Lights and piped-in music don't seamlessly fade and bridge scenes. They slam off, like someone hitting the brakes to avoid a car crash. If you love martial arts and think Kill Bill is high art, you might not mind.\\" New York Daily News review Frank Scheck of the New York Post gave the production three out of four stars and commented, \\"The impressive performers . . . provide a dazzling display of their skills, many involving staffs and sabers, but mostly their masterful control of their own bodies. The athleticism on display is truly amazing . . . Director Liu Tongbiao has choreographed the proceedings with a precision that would put the Rockettes to shame. It all culminates in a final raucous battle, and the most athletic curtain calls probably ever seen on a Broadway stage.\\" New York Post review Michael Kuchwara of the Associated Press called it \\"a striking mixture of sentiment and strength\\" and commented, \\"It is the demanding physicality in the show that counts. That movement celebrates an intense kind of discipline that borders on the spiritual and proves to be surprisingly sturdy Broadway entertainment.\\" Associated Press review ReferencesExternal links *Official website * Category:Chinese culture ","title":"Soul of Shaolin"},{"id":"22825299","text":"Hervieu may refer to: * (1840- ?)

He has war zones as Sudan, Iraq, and Gaza from the U.S. and abroad. Early life and education Lake was born in Philadelphia to a Jewish familyWashington Free Beacon: \\"Hughes Drops Jews\\" January 28, 2013 and graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1994. Career Lake began as national security reporter at the New York Sun and as State Department correspondent for United Press International (UPI). In 2009, Lake reported extensively on President Barack Obama's delicate discussions with Israel over its nuclear program. Later that year, Lake's reporting also helped to scuttle the nomination of Chas Freeman be the chairman of the National Intelligence Council. In 2010, regarding U.S. attempts to try WikiLeaks head Julian Assange under the Espionage Act of 1917, Lake has said: \\"I oppose the application of the espionage statute to Assange because the same kind of prosecution would make me a criminal too.\\" In 2011 at Newsweek/The Daily Beast, Lake broke an exclusive report on how the Obama administration sold Israel powerful bunker buster bombs. In 2012, reporting from Somalia, Lake found a local prison that received Somalis captured by the U.S. Navy and later disclosed how the United Nations documented U.S. violations of an arms embargo in Somalia to funding some of the regional governments there. In 2011, Silverstein wrote an article for Salon claiming that Lake's reporting on Georgia was biased because pro- Georgian lobbyists had paid for his meals and drinks in the past. This report was rebutted by Ben Smith on Politico. Silverstein implied that Lake's relationship with these lobbyists influenced his original report of a bomb blast near the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi. That story was confirmed by The New York Times. Both pieces come to the same conclusion that a Russian military intelligence officer was implicated by Georgian and U.S. authorities in the bombing. Lake has publicly stated he has always paid his tab whenever meeting with Georgian sources. Lake was one of the first reporters to challenge the Obama administration's initial claims in 2012 that the 9-11 anniversary attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi was not connected to al Qaeda. His reporting earned praise from Eliana Johnson and Jeremy Scahill. In 2013, Lake disclosed how court documents in the U.S. government challenge to Blackwater (now Academi) showed that the organization was an extension of the CIA after 9-11. He was a contributing editor for The New Republic between 2008 and 2013. Lake joined The Daily Beast following The New Republic as Senior National Security Correspondent. Lake along with his colleague Josh Rogin left The Daily Beast in October 2014 and joined Bloomberg View. In 2012 Lake reported for The Washington Times on Trita Parsi and his organization NIAC‚Äôs efforts to lobby the U.S. government to ease sanctions on Iran and prevent Dennis Ross from overseeing the US Government's Iran policy. Andrew Sullivan followed up that the documents leaked to Lake for the article suggested the motive of the story was to \\"smear\\" Parsi's reputation. Ken Silverstein, one of Lake's primary critics, has claimed his past sources lacked credibility have been used to manipulate the discourse on national security. Silverstein accused Lake's reporting of supporting WMDs prior to the invasion of Iraq. Silverstein cited an article that Lake had written in 2006 during the war in Iraq. In this article Lake reported that a Pentagon Special Investigator named David Gaubatz had been led to sealed storage facilities of chemical and biological weapons. Gaubatz reported his findings but the military failed to follow-up. Eight years later The New York Times reported on these aging stockpiles of chemical weapons and how they were never destroyed and posed risks to the soldier's involved with storing the hazardous materials. Furthermore, Lake's reporting on U.S. intelligence prior to the Iraqi invasion was one of the first major pieces of journalism to highlight the CIA‚Äôs concerns with intelligence gathered by the Pentagon and Iraqi opposition figure, Ahmad Chalabi. In August of 2013, along with Josh Rogin, Lake reported on a CIA intercept that claimed that Al Qaeda had a meeting of senior leaders in the form of a conference call. Silverstein criticized their work as misreporting for using the term \\"conference call\\" when a later article clarified the call as a remote meeting via internet video, voice conference and chat. Speculation about to the differences in the initial reports ranged from glorification of the NSA's abilities to protection of sources within the U.S. intelligence community. In 2013, he wrote an article for The Daily Beast about how to respond to haters on Twitter and social media, by telling them how he loves their passion. In 2019, Lake wrote about how he perceived Donald Trump's exploitation of Jewish identity politics. He discussed how he believed the US President was leveraging Jewish identity to gain loyalty from American Jews. In March 2017, Lake reported, inaccurately, that an intelligence official had shown House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes intelligence reports that allegedly included inappropriate details about the Trump transition team's communications. Lake later acknowledged that Nunes had \\"misled\\" him and that the reports had in fact been given to Nunes by a White House staffer, raising questions about whether Nunes' investigation was truly independent of the White House.

He joined Henry VIII's household about 1515 as courtier and Gentleman of the Privy chamber, a post of great confidence and trust. There were 40 of these, and their duty was to wait on the king in public and private; they were all knights or esquires of distinction, and the attendance of two was required at each meal, to help and serve the king; they had also to sleep within call of the king at night. In 1519, Sir William Coffin joined King Henry in the tournament of Guesnes, Field of the Cloth of Gold, as one of His Majesty's eighteen favourites. After Anne Boleyn's beheading, Sir William continued to serve in the king's Privy Chamber and as an attendant to His Majesty. He served the King's third wife, Jane Seymour, just as he had served Queen Anne.p.265, Eric Ives, Anne Boleyn In 1529 he was elected MP for Derbyshire, having acquired a connection with that county through his marriage to Margaret Dymocke. In 1531 he was appointed High Sheriff of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. He was Master of the Horse at the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533, when the king knighted him. The historian Eric Ives described Coffin as \\"a professional household administrator, actively concerned with the staffing of his department, and later to serve Jane Seymour in the same capacity.\\"p.265, Eric Ives, Anne Boleyn Marriage William Coffin married Margaret Dymoke, the daughter of Sir Robert Dymoke of Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire, the Hereditary King's Champion, by his wife Anne Sparrow.http://www.tudorplace.com.ar She was the sister of Sir Edward Dymoke and had been since 1517 the widow of Sir Richard Vernon (died 1517) of Haddon Hall, Bakewell, Derbyshire. When Margaret Dymoke was left a wealthy widow by the death of her first husband, King Henry VIII urged her to marry Sir William Coffin. In 1519 Margaret had attended Catalina of Aragon at the Field of the Cloth of Gold and was a fellow courtier with Sir William Coffin, her second husband. Margaret was one of the gentlewomen sent to wait (and spy) upon Anne Boleyn in the Tower. Some accounts give the name as \\"Mistress Cosyns\\" but this is a mistake for Coffin (presumably the confusion was caused by the use of the long \\"S\\"). In Jane Seymour's household Margaret was a Lady of the Bedchamber. Shortly after Sir William Coffin's death in December, 1538, she remarried to Sir Richard Manners (died 1551) of Garendon, Leicestershire, MP for Leicestershire in 1542, a younger son of George Manners, 11th Lord Ros. Sir William Coffin died without children. Death and burial Sir William Coffin died on 8 December 1538 at Standon, Hertfordshire. His death was sudden and he had made his will on the day he died. He was buried in the middle of the chancel of Standon Church, where survives his inscribed memorial stone. Succession Sir William Coffin left no children. He bequeathed most of his leases and goods to his wife, whom he appointed his sole executrix.

Established January 1, 2016, it was formed as a result of the merger between its two predecessor lodges: Moswetuset Lodge (Boston Minuteman Council) and Nanepashemet Lodge (Yankee Clipper Council). The leadership structure of Pennacook Lodge follows \\"The Pennacook Plan\\". This plan breaks the lodge into various blocks (similar to departments in a retail store) and committees. The purpose of this plan is twofold: to divide the lodge into several parts to maximize our capabilities as a program, and to maximize opportunities for both youth and adults to get involved in the lodge. As prescribed by the National Order of the Arrow Committee, all youth members are under the age of 21. Adults are 21+. Those who are 18‚Äì20 years of age are considered youth members for the purpose of voting in lodge business only. Otherwise, they are considered adults in the BSA program and must adhere to all BSA policies and standards just like any other adult in the program. The mission of this Order of the Arrow Lodge is to fulfill its purpose as an integral part of the Boy Scouts of America and the Spirit of Adventure Council through positive youth leadership under the guidance of selected capable adults. As part of Scouting's National Honor Society, our purpose is to: * Recognize those who best exemplify the Scout Oath and Law in their daily lives and through that recognition cause others to conduct themselves in a way that warrants similar recognition. * Promote camping, responsible outdoor adventure, and environmental stewardship as essential components of every Scout‚Äôs experience, in the unit, year-round, and in summer camp. * Develop leaders with the willingness, character, spirit and ability to advance the activities of their units, our Brotherhood, Scouting, and ultimately our nation. * Crystallize the Scout habit of helpfulness into a life purpose of leadership in cheerful service to others.

The range extends from Newfoundland west to Manitoba and Minnesota, south as far as Arkansas, Alabama, and Georgia. Description Gaylussacia baccata closely resembles the native blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) with which it grows in the same habitats. However, it can be readily identified by the numerous resin dots on the undersides of the leaves which glitter when held up to the light. Gaylussacia baccata is a shrub up to 150 cm (5 feet) tall, forming extensive colonies. Flowers are in dangling groups of 3‚Äì7, orange or red, bell-shaped.

He was also a Hessian soldier, and during his service in the thirteen colonies devoted his leisure time to botanical studies of American forests. When he returned to Prussia, he wrote up his research and strongly advocated importing suitable American species of trees and shrubs for use in German forests. Biography He received his education at Waltershausen, and in 1766 entered the service of the Duke of Coburg as lieutenant. He later entered the Prussian army and attained the rank of captain. He came to the United States in 1777 in the Hessian contingent in the British service, served with the Hesse-Kassel Feld Jaegerkorps in New York and Pennsylvania 1778-1783, and won a reputation for his successful raids. He participated in the battles of Brandywine, Charleston and attack on New London, Connecticut. On his return to Germany he was given the cross of the Hessian military order, and later re-entered the Prussian service. While in North America, he had studied the natural history of the country, especially the trees and shrubs. In 1785, he wrote a memoir to the Berlin Academy showing the immense advantages that would be derived from the naturalization of several species of American trees. On request of the academy, he was then sent to Gumbinnen as director general of the waters and forests of eastern Prussia, where he carried on experiments on a large scale and planted a great number of American trees.

He was a maternal nephew of Thomas Cromwell, and profited from the Dissolution of the Monasteries in which he took an active part. He was the patrilineal great- grandfather of Oliver Cromwell. Early life Richard Williams was born about 1510 in the parish of Llanishen, Glamorganshire. cites: Leland's Itinerary, vide letter B in the proofs and illustrations. He was eldest son and heir to Morgan Williams, an aspiring Welsh lawyer (and a paternal descendant of Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, prince of Powys) who moved from Glamorgan to Putney where he initially pursued his business of innkeeper and brewer. Morgan Williams' good fortune was to marry Katherine, the sister of Thomas Cromwell, long before the commencement of the latter's illustrious career as Henry VIII's great minister. In later life, Williams and his son would benefit financially from this relationship, receiving substantial landholdings confiscated from the church. Arms of Sir Richard Williams alias Cromwell: Gules, three chevronels Argent, over all three lions rampant Or, armed and langued Azure. Prot√©g√© of Thomas Cromwell Richard was brought into the court of King Henry VIII by an alliance with Thomas Cromwell, the great favourite of Henry, whom that monarch raised from a humble situation to be Earl of Essex, Vicar- General, and Knight of the Garter. When Thomas Cromwell made his will in July 1529 his nephew, whose parents were now dead, was then in the service of the Marquess of Dorset (father of Henry Grey, and grandfather of Lady Jane Grey). By the autumn of 1529, he had adopted the name Cromwell, and following Dorset‚Äôs death in 1530, he was employed by Stephen Gardiner until early 1533 when he joined his uncle‚Äôs household at Austin Friars and while in his service was introduced at court. For the next ten years, as Richard Cromwell alias Williams, he acted as a trusted agent for the minister, often joining with him in offices and grants. Introduced to Henry VIII, by so powerful an interest as Cromwell, and possessing many qualifications, he soon benefitted from the royal bounty which Henry lavished on his favourites. He was entrusted with considerable appointments early in the administration of his relation; and it appears that he was active in suppressing the Pilgrimage of Grace insurrection. cites Vide letter E in the proofs, etc. Dissolution of the Monasteries Hinchingbrooke House Ramsey Abbey Gatehouse During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Sir Richard was appointed one of the Visitors of the religious houses; cites William Dugdale's History of Warwickshire. his zeal in the cause of both the king and Thomas Cromwell met with an ample reward; perhaps the latter was happy to raise up one of his family to assist and support him. It is certain that on 8 March 1537/8, he had the grant of the nunnery of Hinchingbrooke, in Huntingdonshire. The value of it, as stated in the deed was ¬£19. 9s. 2d.; but we must suppose this monastery to have been very much under-rated: for the grant states the lands and premises given to Sir Richard as lying in the several parishes and hamlets of Hinchinbrooke, Huntingdon, Stewkley-Magna, Stewkley-Parva, Turkington, Houghton, Esington, Alconbury, Paxton-Magna, Paxton-Parva, Hail Weston, Waresley and Bawynhoo, all in the county of Huntingdon; Eltisley, Bottisham and Boxworth in Cambridgeshire; Staplewe, and Bewlow, in Bedfordshire; Hamildon-Parva, in Rutland; and Stoke Doyle and Oakley, in Northamptonshire. cites: Grant in the possession of the Earl of Sandwich. Turkington, Bawynhoo, Elington, Staplewe, and Bewlow, are unknown, except Esington is put for Ellington, which is an adjoining parish to Alconbury. The same year he had also a royal grant of the monastery of Sawtry-Judith, in the county of Huntingdon, valued ¬£199 11s. 1d. cites: Thomas Tanner, Notitia monastica, The church of All Saints, at Fulbourn, in Cambridgeshire, passed by this grant as an appendant to Saltry.

These were very considerable places; cites: Grant in the possession of the earl of Sandwich, whose ancestors purchased the manor of Eynsbury; Eton is supposed to be Eaton Socon, or Eton, in Bedfordshire, and is the adjoining parish to Eynesbury and Little Paxton, and where Lord Sandwich has a small parcel of land; probably the same that is mentioned above. but in the same year he had a grant from the crown of the Abbey of the Grey-Friars, in Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk; cites: Papers communicated by the Rev. Dr Lort. and 4 March 1540, also the site of the rich Abbey of Ramsey in Huntingdonshire, states: \\"The revenue, according to Dugdale, was ¬£1716. 12s. 4d., but according to Speed, ¬£983. 15s. 3 d.\\" and cites Chronicon Abbati√¶ Rameseiensis in Rolls Series (1886); Cartularium Monasterii de Ramsesia in Rolls Series (3 vols.); Dugdale, Monasticon Anglicanum, II (London, 1846); Reyner, Apostolatus Benedictinorum, 149; Wise, Ramsey Abbey, its rise and fall, (1881). with the several meres or lakes belonging to it, in the same parish; cites: The lakes belonging to the Abbey of Ramsey mentioned in the grant were, Huggemere (now Uggmeer) Browswage, Dawntiy (now Dantry) Longbeche, Pollingmere, Wickesmere, Rawingsmere, Baxtermere, Rowmere, and Worlinglowe. Noble gave them as they are written in his time; some of them are large waters, but they are inconsiderable places, many of them not having an house near them. it is expressed in the grant, that it passed in consideration of his good service, and the payment of ¬£4,963 4s. 2d. to be held in capite by knights service. Notes that: Grant from a manuscript in Sir Rob. Cotton's own hand-writing, now the property of Lord Carysfort, communicated to me. Mr. Fuller in his church hist, has fallen into some mistakes relative to Ramsey; he says the money paid was ¬£4,963 4s. 2d. and that there was a rent of ¬£29. 16s. reserved, but this does not appear by the grant, any more than that Sir Richard had all the manors held of the abbey in Huntingdonshire; not one is mentioned: however, he must have another grant for that purpose; it is certain that all Ramsey, and very many manors in Huntingdonshire became his, which once belonged to this abbey. Considerable as this sum then was, it was trifling in comparison of the prodigious value of that abbey and the annual revenue amounted to ¬£1,987. 15s. 3d. The value of the ecclesiastical lands is entirely taken from Speed's maps, as he acknowledges, that he had the history of Huntingdonshire from a very learned and judicious friend of his, who was no other than Sir Robert Cotton, a gentleman every way qualified for such an undertaking. Hinchinbrooke is valued by Sir William Dugdale, at ¬£17. 1s. od. and by Speed, in his Historie of Great Britaine, at ¬£19. 9s. 2d. Sawtry, by them at ¬£141 3s. 8d. and ¬£199. 11s. 8d. and Ramsey, at ¬£1,716 12s. 4d. and ¬£1,983 15s. od. 3qr. The other grants, though many of them were not wholly free, were probably upon easy conditions. It is very certain that the dissolved religious houses were disposed of, for almost nothing; and this knight, we may presume, from his alliance with the vicar-general (who, in fact, had the disposal of them) had great favour shown him; especially, as he was beloved by the sovereign, and was a Visitor; all these grants passed to him by the names of Rich. Williams, otherwise Cromwell. cites: Grants, and Thomas Tanner, Notitia monastica. Member of Parliament and High Sheriff By 1539 he was a gentleman of the privy chamber, and in the same year was elected MP for the seat of Huntingdonshire. In 1539, or early 1540, at the age of thirty, he may have been the subject of a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger. He was knighted 2 May 1540 during a tournament at Westminster where he distinguished himself by his military skill and gallantry: Cromwell, perhaps Sir Richard Cromwell, 1793, engraved by Luigi Schiavonetti Palace of Westminster in the time of Henry VIII Sir Richard and the five other challengers, had each of them, as a reward for their valour, 100 marks annually, with a house to live in, to them and their heirs for ever, granted out of the monastery of the Friary of St Francis, in Stamford, which was dissolved, 8 October 1538, cites: Fuller's hist, of the church, and M.S. in the possession of Dr Lort. which the king was better able to do, as Sir William Weston, the last prior, who had an annuity out of the monastery, died two days after the jousts. We may form an idea of the esteem that the king had for him on account of his gallantry from the following anecdote; when Henry saw Sir Richard's prowess he exclaimed, \\"Formerly thou wast my Dick, but hereafter thou shalt be my diamond\\"; and dropped a diamond ring from his finger, which Sir Richard taking up, he presented it to him, bidding him afterwards bear such a one in the fore gamb of the demy lion in his crest. cites: Fuller's church hist.‚ÄîThe more ancient way of bearing the crest was a javelin in the demy lion's gamb, the protector Oliver used it before his exaltation, but the stone ring after his assumption of sovereign power; Mr Peck not knowing the armorial bearing of the family, supposed it to represent, that he was married to the state: in one visitation of Huntingdonshire there is an ancient mace substituted for the gem ring; in another, a crescent.

He was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1541, cites: Nomina vice comitum, Harl. coll. no. 259. and was again returned as member of parliament for Huntingdonshire, in the parliament which began 16 January 1542. cites Willis's Not. Parl. In this year Henry VIII gave him a grant of the monastery of St Mary's, in the town of Huntingdon, and St Neots Priory, cites Thomas Tanner, Notitia monastica. whose yearly values were ¬£232 7s. and ¬£256 1s. 3d. cites Speed's maps. Dugdale values St Mary's at ¬£187 13s. 8d. and Speed, in his history of Great Britain, at ¬£232 7s. Dugdale and Sir Simon Degge, value St Neots at ¬£241. 11s. 4d.‚ÄîThese grants passed to him, says Tanner, by the styles of Sir Richard Cromwell, alias Williams, and Sir Richard Williams, alias Cromwell. Besides the grants already mentioned, Sir Richard had given to him the office of steward of the lordship of Archenfield, with the constableship of Goodrich Castle in the Welsh Marches, and the power of appointing the master serjeant and porter belonging to those offices, during the nonage of the earl of Shrewsbury. cites Harl. M.S.S. vol. 433. He had also grants of the priory of St Helen Bishopsgate in London; cites: M.S.S. lent to him by Dr Lort. the castles, lordships, and manors of Manorbier and Penally, both in the county of Pembroke, of the value of ¬£100 to him and his heirs-male by knights' service; and also by exchange for other lands, Neath Abbey in Glamorgan; which last he probably procured, because it lay near his paternal seat and the place of his birth; the times of the pasting these grants are unknown. War in France When war broke out with France in 1542, he was sent over to that kingdom, as general of the infantry: all the officers for this expedition were selected, they being \\"all right hardie and valiant knights, esquires, and gentlemen\\". This force, which amounted to 6,000 men, having crossed the sea, marched out of Calais, to join the Emperor Charles V on 22 July in an attempt to retake Landrecies, which had lately been wrested from that monarch by the French. King Francis I of France, anxious to save the place, appeared before it; and the allies, with the Emperor at their head, as boldly opposed them; but, when both parties thought a battle inevitable, and the allies had drawn out their army, the French King took that opportunity to relieve the garrison and having resupplied the place with men, ammunition, and provisions; and marched away. The allies, to revenge themselves, attacked the Dauphin who was left with the rearguard; but, being too eager, they fell into an ambuscade, and many of the English were taken prisoners: amongst them were Sir George Carew, Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir Edward Bellingham. However, the English amply retorted upon the French, killing and taking great numbers prisoner. Mark Noble was of the opinion, that the English forces behaved themselves with great gallantry during their short stay in France; cites Holinshed's chronicle. which was only until November in the same year. cites Cooper's chron. In the account of this expedition history does not record the particular achievements of individuals that composed the army but Noble speculates that Sir Richard behaved with his usual good conduct; especially as, in the following year 1544, Henry appointed him constable of Berkeley Castle. cites Dugdale's baronage‚Äîin 1544 the great seal was delivered to Thomas Lord Wriothesley, the deed being executed for that purpose, pr√¶sentibus tunc ibidem spectabilibus viris, amongst others, Ricardo Cromwell, milite. Rymer's f≈ìdera. Marriage and issue By 8 March 1534 Richard had married Frances (‚Äì), daughter to Thomas Murfyn (d.1523), an alderman and a former Lord Mayor of London, and his second wife, Elizabeth Donne, daughter to Sir Angel Donne and Anne Hawardine. Her mother subsequently married Sir Thomas Denys in 1524. Lady Frances was still living in June 1542, but had died before her husband made his will on 20 June 1544. The couple had two sons: *Henry Williams, alias Cromwell, (1537‚Äì1604), Richard's eldest son and heir, grandfather of Oliver Cromwell. *Francis Williams, alias Cromwell, (‚Äì1598), was one of the Knights of the Shire for the county of Huntingdon in 1572, cites: Willis's not. parl. and later Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire; according to Fuller, he resided at Hinchingbrooke; cites: Fuller's worthies, and nom. vicecomitum Harl. coll. no. 259, fay the 30th. but his usual place of residence was at Hinchinford, in Huntingdonshire. He married Marg. the daughter of Henry Mannock, of that place, cites: Visitation of Huntingdonshire, in 1613. Harl. M.S.S. vol. 1073. and died 4 August 1598: by the inquisitio post mortem taken at St Ives, 16 November following, it appears that he left a son, Henry Williams, alias Cromwell, then 23 years of age, his heir, possessed of the site of St Neots Priory, called the Fermerne; manor of St Neots, valued at ¬£14. per ann. with 80 acres of pasture, called Little and Great-Dirty Wintringham; the manor of Grafham, valued at ¬£9. per annum and the manor of Hardwick, valued at ¬£14. per annum held of the king by knights' service. cites T. Cole's coll. ex. Recor. Cur. Wardor. Harl. M.S.S. Noble also notes that there can be little doubt but the above estates were the property of Sir Richard Williams, alias Cromwell, knt. and it should be observed that the value of the lands mentioned in the inquisitions are usually about a 10th part of the annual value, and often not so much. Death Sir Richard died on 20 October 1544. He had made his will on 20 June 1544, in which he styles himself Sir Richard Williams, otherwise called Sir Richard Cromwell, knt. and of his majesty's privy chamber; he directed that his body should be buried in the place where he should die; and devises his estates in the counties of Cambridge, Huntingdon, Lincoln, and Bedford, to his eldest son Henry, with the sum of ¬£500 to purchase him necessary furniture, when he should come of age: his estates in Glamorganshire he devises to his son Francis and bequeathed ¬£300 to each of his nieces, Joan, and Ann, daughters of his brother, Walter Cromwell; and directed that if Thomas Wingfield, then Sir Richard's ward, should choose to marry either of them, he should have his wardship remitted to him, otherwise the same should be sold. He also left three of his best great horses to the king, and one other great horse to his cousin, Gregory Cromwell, after the king had chosen: legacies were also left to Sir John Williams, and Sir Edward North, chancellor of the court of augmentation; and to several other persons, who seem to have been servants. Gabriel Donne, Andrew Judde, William Coke, Philip Lentall, and Richard Servington, were appointed executors. His will was proved on 24 November 1546. notes: Sir Richard Williams, alias Cromwell's will, is very long, covering four folio pages of parchment closely written (Prerogative Court of Canterbury: PCC 20 Alen). It is remarkable, that of the many wills of this family registered in the prerogative-office, there is not one that specifies any particular place for the interment of the testator. Noble observes that Sir Richard must have left a prodigious fortune to his family, by what he possessed by descent, grants and purchases of church-lands, and from the sums he must have acquired by filling very lucrative employments, with the liberal donations of Henry VIII. This is evident from his possessions in Huntingdonshire, the annual amount of which, at an easy rent, were worth at least ¬£3,000 per annum. These estates only, in Fuller's time were, cites Fuller's worthies he says, valued by some at ¬£20,000 and by others as ¬£30,000 annually, and upwards; and from what these estates now let for, in and near Ramsey and Huntingdon (which are only a part of them) Noble presumes that Sir Richard's estates, in that county only, would in 1787 bring in as large a revenue as any peer at that time enjoyed; and yet it is evident that Sir Richard had considerable property in several other counties as well.

While considered to be a member of the Mexican muralism movement, his style was noticeably different, mostly for adhering to older and more academic forms of painting and sculpture. He had his most success exhibiting in the United States and Europe, but he did murals and sculptures in Mexico. His best known work is a sculpture called La maternidad which was adapted as the logo of the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social (IMSS). Life Portrait of Cant√∫'s first wife Luz Fabila Cant√∫ was born to Mar√≠a Luiza Garza, a novelist, and Adolfo Cant√∫, a journalist who opposed the Porfirio D√≠az regime. He was born shortly before the Mexican Revolution and spent his childhood split between Nuevo Le√≥n and San Antonio, Texas, with the family moving back permanently to Mexico in the 1920s. He was born on March 3, 1907 in Monterrey, but later in life, he changed his birth year to 1908 and his birthplace to Cadereyta Jim√©nez, where his family was originally from. In 1922, at age 14, Cant√∫ entered the Escuela de Pintura al Aire Libre, which was directed by Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez. He had contact with the growing Mexican muralism movement and briefly studied fresco painting under Diego Rivera in 1924. From 1924 to 1934, he traveled and lived in Europe and the United States. He first went to live in Paris on Rue Delambre in Montparnasse, being only sixteen years old. During his time in Europe he met various artists of the avant garde of the time, including Picasso, Alfonso Reyes, poet C√©sar Vallejo and sculptor Mateo Hern√°ndez. He studied with sculptor Jose de Creeft. When he lived in Paris, he gathered a collection of drawings called the \\"Paris Collection\\" by his son Federico Cant√∫ Fabila , FCF. However, during his time there, he created over two chests of drawings made at Le Grande Chaumi√®re. These chests were lost. In 1929, he married his first wife, Luz Fabila Montes de Oca. His times in the United States were short periods. He left Europe for Mexico in 1934. In the 1930s, he joined a group of painters with the In√©s Amor gallery but soon after, established a studio in New York, as friends of his from Montparnasse were there to escape the Second World War. He died on January 29, 1989. His remains are at the foot of his mural Dios Padre y crucifixion (1959) at the chapel of the Universidad Intercontinental in Tlalpan. Career Adolfo Cant√∫, artist, art historian and grandson of the artist in an interview about Cant√∫'s life and work (in Spanish) Cant√∫'s career extended over 65 years and included exhibitions, monumental works, design, illustrations and more. From 1924 to 1931 he exhibited his work in the United States and Europe, with his first exhibition occurring at the Exposition Park Museum in Los Angeles. His first exhibition in Mexico was in 1933 at the Sal√≥n de Arte of the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. While living in New York, he took part in several collective shows. He had much of his success in these two places, with other shows at Tate Gallery in London, the Museum of Modern Art, the Macy's Gallery and the Perls Gallery in New York. He did monumental works such as murals and sculptures, with one of the first a mural with Roberto Montenegro in 1934. These works can be found at universities, government buildings and private homes. From 1951 to the early 1960s, he devoted most of his time painting murals in private homes, with a number of these since acquired by the government of Nuevo Le√≥n. In the 1950s, he created a mural at the headquarters of the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social in Mexico City called Las Ense√±anzas de Quetzalcoatl and another called Maternidad Yacente. The first was damaged by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, and was repaired by his son, Cantu Fabila and his wife Elsa. In 1958 he sculpted two stone slabs for the exterior of the Unidad Independencia theater in Mexico City. However, the day after they were finished, they were robbed. A similar fate happened to one of the copies of the IMSS emblem. He created a low relief called El Flechador del sol in 1961 on the Sierra Madre along the highway between Linares and Galeana in the municipality of Iturbide, Nuevo Le√≥n. However, this work crumbled in 2002, with recovered pieces now on display at a site museum. His last monument was designed in 1988, and was dedicated to Alfonso Reyes. One notable mural is Los informantes de Sahag√∫n at the former monastery of San Diego, which was the site of the Pinacoteca Virreinal in Mexico City. He also created a mural dedicated to Greek myth at the Philosophy and Letters department of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n. He also created murals for a church in San Miguel Allende but they were defaced due to a dispute between the artist the institution over how the characters were portrayed. Stained glass piece called El Huerto de Getseman√≠ (1957) at the missionary chapel in the Sanctuary of Guadalupe in Monterrey One of the murals he did in a private home was that of Benito Coquet, a public official. When he became head of IMSS in 1958, he hired Cant√∫ to make sculptures and designs for the IMSS, Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social. His best known sculpture from this relationship is La maternidad, which is used as the symbol of IMSS. The emblem is also known as \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de Seguro Social\\" (Our Lady of Social Security). Illustration for Renato Leduc's work Poemas en Paris, from the Cant√∫ Y de Teresa collection In addition to canvas works and monumental pieces, Cant√∫ worked on a number of other projects. In 1945, he began working with Carlos Alvarado Lang, creating burin engraving and dry point. He illustrated poems by writer friends such as Renato Leduc, Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n, Antonin Artaud and Al√≠ Chumacero. His first monograph work and book was A Matter of Love by Mackinley Helm, which Cant√∫ illustrated; both were published in 1946. In addition to the work he did for IMSS, other important sculptures include Las ense√±anzas de Quetzalc√≥atl and Las ense√±anzas de cura Hidalgo. However, a significant number of his works have been lost for various reasons, especially those done in Europe. In addition, Cant√∫ taught both in Mexico and the United States. In the 1940s, he was an instructor at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\". In 1951 he was a guest lecturer at the University of California. His work can be found at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n, the Basilica de la Purisima in Monterrey NL Letania, the former monastery of San Diego, the Pinacoteca Virreinal, the Charles Morgan Gallery in New York and Vatican City. He has been featured in a number of monographic publications and his work has been covered in books such as Cien a√±os a trav√©s de cien artistas of the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo de Monterrey (2000) and Arte Nuestro of the Museo Metropolitano de Monterrey (2005). While alive, he had a retrospective at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1970, and was one of the few to receive homage at the same institution while alive in 1986. After his death his work has still been sold and exhibited. In 2005, his painting Mujer Desnuda sold for 19,000 USD at Sotheby's. In 2007, the Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de M√©xico held a large exhibition of his work for the 100th anniversary of his birth. Artistry Cant√∫ created watercolors, oils, drawings, inks, prints, monotypes, sculptures and murals. He was admired for the quality of his drawings, which incorporated the people and landscapes of Mexico into his historical and religious works. In Europe, he was exposed to the avant garde movements of the time and in Mexico, the dominant form of Mexican muralism. However, Cant√∫'s style was classical and academic, often combining classic myth with modern symbolism. This was true even of his mural work, and he was the only major painter at the time doing religious themes. This put him at the margins of his Mexican muralist contemporaries. His dissatisfaction with this situation was expressed by him: \\"Is it fair to discount me as a Mexican, just because my paints do not drip mole or sweat pulque?\\" However, he has come to be known as \\"El gran olvidado\\" (the great forgotten one). He was an avid reader, with literature being a major influence on his work. He was especially fond of 15th-century French poet Fran√ßois Villon, but also read much of the work of Alfonso Reyes, Renato Leduc, Efra√≠n Huerta, Jean Nicolas, Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Val√©ry, Lord Byron, Goethe, Andr√© Malraux, Antonin Artaud, and Paul √âluard.

Based in Kalamazoo, this city has hosted a council since 1915 when it was known just as the Kalamazoo Council. The Council Number has always been #270. In 1927 \\"AREA\\" was added to the council name. That name stuck for only two years before the council again changed its name to the Kalamazoo Fruitbelt Area Council. This time the name lasted eight years before additional territory and a desire for a shorter name prompted the council to change the name to just the Fruitbelt Area Council in 1937. In 1973 there was a three way merger that formed the current Southwest Michigan Council. Battle Creek MI had their own council dating back to 1915 with a council of the same name. In 1927 \\"AREA\\" was added to the Council (always designated Council # 256). In 1956 the council in Battle Creek changed their name to Nottawa Trails Council which lasted until the 1973 merger. The other component of the 1973 merger came from the small lakefront town of Saint Joseph which had hosted the Southwestern Michigan Council (#258) since 1941. Before that Saint Joseph had hosted the Berrien County Council as far back as 1919. In 1923 the name was changed to the Benton Harbor & Saint Joseph Council and then in 1929 the name was edited to become the Berrien-Cass Area Council. Records show the Council ending in 1941 when its final name of Southwestern Michigan Council (#258) was adopted. The name aptly describes the council which has most of that corner of the state (with La Salle Council in Indiana picking up two of the border counties at the extreme lower tip of the state). Finally, there were several other early councils of note in the town of South Haven, there was briefly an unnumbered council from 1917 to 1918. Similarly in 1923 the town of Sturgis had the Sturgis Council (#279) until 1929 when the name changed to Fort Hill Council, where it lasted another two years before being merged with the Kalamazoo-Fruit Belt Area Council. The town of Dowagiac had a council (#263) from 1917 to 1927 before merging with the Benton Harbor & Saint Joseph Council. In 2012 the Southwest Michigan Council was merged with the Great Sauk Trail Council to form the Southern Shores Field Service Council as a part of the Area 2 Project, which created four Field Service Councils in the lower peninsula of Michigan, under the Michigan Crossroads Council =Organization= The council is administratively divided into districts: * Nottawa Trails District * Pathfinder District * Wabano District =Properties= Rota-Kiwan Scout Reservation is a 199-acre property located in Texas Township just outside of the Kalamazoo city limits. Rota-Kiwan was erected in 1921, and is the third oldest camp in Michigan. Rota-Kiwan is composed of two camps, Camp Madron, which is the Boy Scout and Webelos Camp, and Camp T. Ben Johnson, which is the Cub Scout Camp. The camp services many Scouts and Scouters from all over the state and many from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and recently Canada. This camp was officially closed by the BSA MCC (Michigan Crossroads Council) December 2019 against the wishes of the local scouts, volunteers and the residents of Texas Township. =Order of the Arrow= Nacha-Mawat served as the council Order of the Arrow lodge. The name means \\"three into one.\\" The name was adopted after the merging of the Carcajou, Mandoka, and Wakazoo Lodges. At this time, to foster brotherhood and reduce strife, the fleur de lis was chosen as the lodge totem. The Lodge adopted a policy that each member will get two lifetime lodge flaps for each honor in the OA: red for ordeal, blue for brotherhood, and silver Mylar for vigil. This policy was adopted in 2006 and was suspended in (approximately) 2009 when the lodge supply of these flaps ended. There are also trader flaps which are unrestricted; these 'trader flaps' are now the only flaps issued by the lodge. The Nacha-Mawat totem is now the Blue Heron. The Lodge has achieved quality lodge in 2010, and 2011. It brings outstanding service projects to Rota-Kiwan Scout Reservation.

Life and work Thelma Biral was born in Buenos Aires to Otello and Sira Biral, recently arrived Italian immigrants from the Veneto Region. The family relocated to Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1945, and Biral later enrolled at the Italian Lyceum, a prestigious secondary school. A precocious actress, Biral began directing school plays at age 12 and, following the attendance of one of these by Orestes Caviglia, the veteran theatre director recommended her to the National Dramatic Arts School.Vida de Thelma Biral Graduating at only 14 years of age, Biral applied for admission into the National Comedy of Uruguay. The institution's director, Margarita Xirgu, allowed the young talent to claim she was 18 - the prerequisite for admission. There, she met Oscar Pedemonte, and the couple married in 1963. That year, Xirgu recommended her young prot√©g√© to Buenos Aires' important San Mart√≠n Theatre, at the time mounting a televised production of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's Yerma. Hired as an understudy to Spanish actress Mar√≠a Casares, her performance opened doors for her in Argentine television. She was cast in 1964 for a leading role in a Soap opera, El amor tiene cara de mujer (Love Has a Woman's Face),IMDB: biography and following numerous other appearances in the genre, she was given her first film role in Julio Saraceni's 1967 romantic comedy Villa cari√±o (Love Town).Cine Nacional Biral continued to perform in the theatre, remaining prominent on the stage as a comic actress. Among her numerous stage performances after becoming a household name on television was opposite veteran comic Nin√≠ Marshall in Roberto Romero's Coqueluche (1972). That year, Biral had her only child, Bruno Pedemonti (who became a noted actor in his own right). She was cast by noted period piece director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson for two thrillers: La maffia (1972) and Los siete locos (Seven Madmen), the following year. The latter role earned Biral a Journalists' Association Award for Best Dramatic Actress. She returned to soaps in 1976 for Alberto Migr√©'s Dos a quererse (Two for Love) and in 1980, accepted perhaps her most memorable role as an alcoholic in Fernando Ayala's Desde el abismo (From the Abyss). This (her second collaboration with Ayala) earned her a second Journalists' Association Award. She starred opposite H√©ctor Alterio in H√©ctor Olivera's Los Viernes de la eternidad (Fridays in Eternity), in 1981. She was given a Press Prize for the role; but, for years afterwards, she limited her performances to the theatre, where she earned plaudits for protagonizing James Sparks' Sparks, Bernard Slade's Souffl√© and, from 1991 to 1996, Sebasti√°n Moncada's Brujas (Witches).Clar√≠n She accepted a role in a 1994 edition of her first soap opera, \\"Love Has a Woman's Face,\\" and in 1997, portrayed a struggling artist's estranged mother in Fernando D√≠az's Plaza de almas.

The Blast was conceived as an entry-level motorcycle to attract newcomers to motorcycling in general and to Harley-Davidson in particular. As such, the design goals were low cost and ease of operation and maintenance. Steps to achieve these goals include the use of an automatically tensioned belt final drive, self-adjusting hydraulic valve lifters, and a carburetor with an automatic choke. The engine design was borrowed from Harley's Evolution Sportster engine with the rear cylinder eliminated. The plastic bodywork pieces of the Blast were made from Surlyn, a substance used to make the outside of golf balls, to protect the surfaces when the Blast is dropped, and the color is molded-in. The Blast was used in Harley-Davidson's Rider's Edge New Rider program, a similar course to the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's Basic \\"RiderCourse\\". In July 2009, prior to ceasing all motorcycle production, Buell ran an ad campaign stating that the Buell Blast would no longer appear in their line-up. The ad featured a Buell Blast being destroyed in an automobile crusher. For 2010, a limited run of crushed Blast cubes was offered for sale upon request. They were available in Battle Blue, Midnight Black, and Sunfire Yellow, and were individually signed and numbered by Erik Buell.

Many firearms, particularly older firearms, had a notch cut into the hammer allowing half- cock, as this position would neither allow the gun to fire nor permit the hammer-mounted firing pin to rest on a live percussion cap or cartridge. The purpose of the half-cock position has variously been used either for loading a firearm, as a safety mechanism, or for both reasons. The still commonly used English expression of \\"going off half-cocked\\" derives from failing to complete the cocking action, leading to the weapon being unable to fire. This is often used to describe someone acting prematurely, as in the case of one preparing to shoot their weapon without having set the firearm into \\"full-cock\\" position.  Early examples  Cutaway view of the action of the Remington- Ryder No. 22 breech-loading rifle, which loads only with the hammer at half cock. Figure 1: Arm at the moment of discharge. Figure 2: Open to receive the cartridge. Figure 3: At half cock, loaded. Early flintlocks had required a half-cock position to prime the pan, in preparation for firing the firearm, after loading the main chamber. Some other early types of revolvers, such as the Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, required the user to place the hammer at half- cock to permit rotation of the cylinder to load the firearm. On such firearms, the standard practice was not to load all 6 chambers and leave the hammer at half-cock, but, rather, to load only 5 of 6 chambers by standard safety practice, and stow the dropped hammer on an unloaded chamber. Nonetheless, some users did use the half-cock notch as a very early safety on such revolvers when all 6 chambers were loaded, often to a dangerous and unintended consequence. Likewise, some early types of repeating lever action cartridge rifles‚Äîsuch as the Winchester Model 94 rifle‚Äîhad a half-cock position that was intended to serve as a safety mechanism, to keep the hammer away from the firing pin while holding the rifle when a round was chambered, such as when in a blind awaiting game to appear. Although the practice is less common today, the half-cock notch position on such rifles was formerly used by many hunters as a safety when carrying the loaded rifle with a round chambered while hunting. The half-cock position of the hammer did not serve a purpose while loading such firearms.  Common examples and breakage  The half-cock notch most commonly worked through insertion of a spring-loaded thin metal plate into a slot cut into the tumbler, the tumbler being variously either part of the hammer or mechanically attached to the pivot-point of the hammer, depending on the particular firearm under discussion. When the tumbler/hammer rotated quickly from full-cock, the spring-loaded metal plate could not engage into the slot cut into the tumbler, and the firearm could fire since the hammer would fully rotate. When the tumbler/hammer rotated slowly from full- cock, such as when engaging the half-cock notch, the metal plate would slide into the slot cut in the tumbler, thereby preventing the hammer/tumbler from rotating fully, hence preventing the hammer from falling and the gun from firing. In practice, the half-cock notch was often prone to breakage when used as an early safety mechanism, whereby the tumbler would have part of the metal around the slot shear away, thereby removing the fragile safety mechanism, and permitting the hammer to fall and the firearm to fire. This could occur from accidentally dropping the loaded firearm onto its half-cocked hammer even once. References Category:Firearm terminology ","title":"Half-cock"},{"id":"22825672","text":"Friend v. Childs Dining Hall Co., 231 Mass. 65, 120 N.E. 407 (1918), is part of a progression of cases that influenced the products liability synthesis that emerged in the 1930s. These cases influenced Judge Cardozo's argument in MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. that a person could be liable for a defective product to someone other than the immediate purchaser.MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916). This created the law of product liability. Facts Plaintiff entered defendant's restaurant and ordered \\"New York baked beans and corned beef.\\"Friend v. Childs Dining Hall Co., 231 Mass. 65, 67, 120 N.E. 407 (1918). There were stones in the food. There was no evidence either that the defendant knew of the presence of the stones in the food, or that he made an express warranty as to the food. The plaintiff gave no instructions respecting the food other than to order it. Plaintiff started with a declaration which sought recovery in both tort and contract. Then she abandoned the tort claim. At trial, the defendant won a directed verdict because the judge decided that there was no cause of action in contract. Plaintiff appeals her contract claim, arguing that the defendant breached an implied warranty under the Uniform Sales Act (St. 1908 c. 237 ¬ß15(1), predecessor of UCC Article 2), which says that: :‚ÄúWhere the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller‚Äôs skill or judgment, whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not, there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.‚Äù Holding Under the Sales Act, it does not matter whether it was established on the evidence that the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant was a sale of food, or a contract for entertainment, in order to be submitted to a jury. *1 The service of food by the defendant is a ‚Äúsale‚Äù under the sales act, St. 1908, c. 237, ¬ß15(1). Under tort law, when the keeper of a public eating place supplies food to a person who has supplied consideration to be served with food for immediate consumption, the keeper has an implied duty to furnish food to eat. However, there is additionally a contract relationship between these parties. When a restaurant supplies a meal to a customer (customer making known, as the purpose for which food is required, that it is to be eaten), then a sale of food occurs (by the terms of the Sales Act, ¬ß 15, subd.1). Accordingly, there is an implied warranty it is reasonably fit for consumption, and the restaurant can be liable for breach of this contract, and not merely for negligence. *2 Food for immediate use, which is not fit to eat, is not merchantable as food. In an action for breach of an implied warranty of fitness of food served by a restaurant, whether plaintiff was or was not in the exercise of ‚Äúdue care‚Äù was immaterial; the term being one of the law of torts. Instead‚Äîwhether the transaction established on the evidence between the plaintiff and the defendant be treated as a sale of food or as a contract for entertainment‚Äîthere are relevant facts to be submitted to the jury, including: whether rational investigation of the character of the food was made by plaintiff, and whether its noxious nature should have been discovered.

The Torre del Gallo is a historical building located in Florence, Italy, located at Pian de' Giullari, in the hills of Arcetri, on top of a ridge overlooking the city where there is a magnificent panorama. HistoryOrigins= In ancient times it was part of a genuinely fortified castle on the hill, strategically close to Florence. According to some historians, it belonged to the family Galli (or Gallo), who were of very ancient origin. An emblem written in Gothic calligraphy still remains in stone near a plaque located on one of the walls of the courtyard. Taking advantage of their position, the family demanded a toll from people coming down towards Florence from Impruneta. The fortress was partially demolished in 1280 due to the conflict between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Further damage was inflicted in 1364 following the devastation of raids by the condottiero John Hawkwood, who ravaged the hills of Arcetri with \\"iron and fire\\". =The Lanfredini= The tower was later sold to Lamberteschi, who proceeded to rebuild it. It was then resold in 1464 to the brothers Jacopo and Giovanni Lanfredini, who lived there until the end of the fourteenth century, next to the Villa la Gallina. The Torre del Gallo passed to their descendants until the end of the family line in 1941, with the death of Cardinal Giacomo Lanfredini, Bishop of Osimo and Cingoli. Some key moments in the history of the castle were experienced during the siege of Florence (1529-1530), when Pier Maria III de' Rossi, Count of San Secondo, the nephew of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere and commander of the Imperial troops, made it their headquarters with his troops hosted by Bartolomeo Lanfredini: from the top of the tower a hail of artillery were directed towards the area of Villa Giovannelli against the fortifications of San Miniato al Monte. =The Galilean Museum and Stefano Bardini= The loggetta. In 1872, after several changing of hands, the tower came to Count Paolo Galletti who opened a small museum dedicated to Galileo, in which busts, portraits and heirlooms were housed. Now, they are mostly found in the Museo di Storia della Scienza in Piazza dei Giudici. The count commissioned painter Gaetano Bianchi to create frescoes in the rooms of the museum. The present appearance of the tower, however, is the result of the neo-medieval restoration style, which was carried out between 1904 and 1906 from the antiques dealer Stefano Bardini, who bought the tower in 1902 and was also responsible for the Museo Bardini. A court with three balconies (some attributed to Brunelleschi) remained from the fifteenth century structure. Meanwhile the outer building and the tower were a complete reconstruction, although it was possible to use ancient materials retrieved from recent demolitions caused by the reorganization of Florence. A second courtyard was added, as well as a garden, a Renaissance-style loggia, near the entrance in Via Torre del Gallo, and a detached building used as a laboratory stock. Inside, the eclectic character of the materials re-used from different times and places are more obvious: windows, columns, portals, wells, and antique fireplaces recreate the picturesque surroundings, but are not very convincing, historically. The work was concluded in 1907, as testified by a plaque. =Contemporary times= The area was abandoned during the period between the two world wars. During World War II, the building was occupied by the Military Pharmaceutical Institute, then by the Fascist Federation, and, after requisition by the British troops, it became a prison camp. During this period some of the decorations were lost or destroyed. Today the building is privately owned. Architecture The villa, which is dominated by the tall tower, has a large hall with an octagonal vaulting, and an entry with graffiti, perhaps from the Renaissance. The court attributed to Brunelleschi is surrounded by Corinthian columns and arches on three sides, while the second neo-gothic courtyard is decorated with many coats of arms belonging to the owners of the villa and ones Bardini added. The marble terrace is inspired by the Renaissance Venetian style of Jacopo Sansovino, who adorned the park and some ruins with a monumental fountain. The great hall on the south side of the park, near the Villa La Gallina, was the laboratory-warehouse Bardini. Left unoccupied, it has now been restored and converted into residences.

The IRA's 2nd Kerry Brigade ambushed a train carrying British troops of the Royal Fusiliers at Headford Junction railway station near Killarney, County Kerry. This sparked a battle lasting almost an hour, in which at least 14 people were killed ‚Äì nine British soldiers, two IRA volunteers and three civilians. The IRA withdrew after another train carrying British troops arrived. Background The guerrilla war in Kerry escalated rapidly in the spring of 1921. The county was occupied by the British Army, Auxiliary Division and Black and Tan paramilitary police, as well as the Royal Irish Constabulary. From the autumn of 1920, they had been burning suspected Republicans' property and shooting suspected IRA sympathisers. By early 1921, they had begun rounding up male inhabitants of nearby towns and villages and searching for IRA suspects. This began in Tralee on 11 January. On 23 January, in response to the IRA's assassination of RIC District Inspector Sullivan (who was shot while walking with his five-year-old son), 1,000 soldiers and armed police surrounded Ballymacelligott, arrested 240 men and marched them to Tralee for questioning. British forces, especially the Auxiliaries, also carried out a number of reprisal shootings of local civilians.T Ryle Dwyer, Tans Terror and Troubles, Kerry's Real Fighting Story. Mercier Press, 2001. pp. 270-73 The IRA set up full-time guerrilla units (known as flying columns), to avoid arrest and to assemble units capable of taking on British patrols. IRA GHQ in Dublin also sent an organizer, Andy Cooney, to Kerry to oversee the setting up of flying columns. On 2 March, under Cooney's direction, the 2nd Kerry Brigade set up its own flying column under Dan Allman and Tom McEllistrim. On 5 March, McEllistrim led 20 volunteers from the column to a successful ambush at Clonbanin, in which they co-operated with Cork IRA units, killing four British soldiers (including Brigadier General Cumming).Dwyer, pp.281-284 Buoyed by their success in Cork, the 2nd Kerry Brigade tried on a number of occasions to ambush British forces in Kerry itself. The ambush On 21 March, an IRA party of the 2nd Kerry Brigade was billeted about four miles from the Headford railway junction when they heard that British troops were returning by train from Kenmare to Tralee. As the train did not go directly, the British would have to change at Headford, making them vulnerable to ambush. Allman, commanding 30 volunteers, reached the junction only 12 minutes before the train, which was carrying 30 soldiers of the 1st Royal Fusiliers. The railway staff just had time to flee before the train pulled into the platform, where its passengers had to change trains for Tralee. Alongside the soldiers, the train was packed with cattle and pig farmers, on their way back from the market in Kenmare. Most of the civilians had already got off when the British soldiers began to disembark. Allman himself tried to disarm a Fusilier but shot him when he resisted. Other accounts say the soldier was shot dead as he went to use the lavatory. This was the signal for the IRA to open fire on the British troops. One of the first British casualties was Lieutenant CE Adams DCM,CWGC entry for Lieutenant Adams, cwgc.org; accessed 22 March 2017. who was shot dead when he appeared at the carriage door, as were several other soldiers who were standing in front of the engine. The surviving British troops opened fire from the train, while those who had got off scrambled underneath it for cover. In the ensuing close- quarter firefight, conducted at a range of just 20 yards, three civilians and two IRA volunteers (including Allman) were killed. Two-thirds of the British force is estimated to have been killed or wounded. Most of those killed were hit in the initial firing. Afterwards, the IRA gunmen had no direct field of fire into the troops who were hidden under the train. MacEllistrim called on the survivors to surrender and when they refused, the IRA began to move in to finish off those who kept shooting, by throwing hand grenades under the train. Just as they were doing so, another train pulled into the junction, carrying another party of British troops. The IRA column had used most of its ammunition and was forced to retreat, escaping toward the hills in the south.Dwyer, p. 293 Casualties The British Army reported that seven soldiers were killed outright and that two more were fatally wounded. There were a further twelve non-fatal injuries among the troops. The IRA however thought there were far more British casualties. One of the attackers recalled, \\"twelve coffins left Killarney later and that wasn't all\\". Tom McEllistrim reported to his superiors that as many as 25 British soldiers had been killed.Dwyer, p.294. Allman and another IRA guerrilla, Lt Jimmy Baily, were killed in the ambush. One civilian was killed outright and two mortally wounded, with two others (a father and daughter) seriously wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the ambush, McEllistrim shot dead a suspected spy whom his men had captured.Dwyer, p. 291 See also *Upton train ambush ReferencesExternal links *An account of the Headford Ambush *The Irish Board of Military History, signed account of the Ambush Category:Conflicts in 1921 Category:Military actions and engagements during the Irish War of Independence Category:History of County Kerry Category:1921 in Ireland Category:Mass murder in 1921 Category:British Army in the Irish War of Independence Category:March 1921 events Category:Ambushes ","title":"Headford Ambush"},{"id":"22825839","text":"La Silla Vac√≠a (Spanish: \\"The Empty Chair\\") is a Colombian news website founded by journalist and writer Juanita Le√≥n in 2009. The site focuses primarily on Colombian politics. La Silla Vac√≠a describes itself as an \\"informative and interactive medium for people interested in Colombian political current issues,\\" by focusing on \\"stories which actually describe the way power is exercised in Colombia: on political figures who pull the strings of power, strategies in order to reach and keep it, on ideas and interests which underlie the big decisions taken in the country,\\" aiming to do \\"good journalism.\\" Name Its name, \\"The Empty Chair\\" (or, alternatively, \\"The Empty Seat\\"), makes reference to at least two political events in Colombia. The first one occurred 7 January 1999, when the failed peace process between president Andr√©s Pastrana administration and FARC started. Manuel Marulanda V√©lez (aka Tirofijo / Sureshot), FARC top leader at the time, refused to attend the ceremony held in San Vicente del Cagu√°n, leaving a plastic white chair assigned to him empty. The second alludes to a proposal prompted by the parapolitics scandal. The idea was to punish lawmakers and ultimately parties involved with illegal armed groups in case they are investigated or arrested, leaving their seats in Congress empty, instead of being replaced with another politician. It was passed by the House of Representatives in May 2009, but it will be enforced only if the lawmaker is sentenced, and it will not apply for current Congresspeople, just as president √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez wished. But the founder has said that the name comes from a march of indigenous communities in Cauca who marched through the Pan American road to meet President Uribe and he never went to the encounter. So they left an empty seat for him. \\" Contents The website was originally divided in five big sections: *Desde la Silla (\\"From the Chair\\"): the main stories published on the website.

The house  The house lies on a historic site, and the seat of a manor, being occupied by a house from the Elizabethan era. At one point the manor was held by Richard Wightwick, who co-founded Pembroke College of the University of Oxford. By 1855 the house was occupied by Henry Mill Bunbury, who had the house remodelled by Mr. W. Butterfield. The current Marlston House was built between 1895 and 1899 by Edward Burgess in the Elizabethan style to replace that remodelled house. It was built for George Palmer, who was one of the founders of the Huntley & Palmers biscuit factory, mayor of the nearby town of Reading, and Member of Parliament for Reading. After George Palmer died in 1897, the house was occupied by his son, George William Palmer, who was also mayor of, and Member of Parliament for, Reading. The house has been used as a school since 1945. It was listed as a grade II* listed building in 1983.

Childs Dining Hall Company, 231 Mass. 86, 120 N.E. 396, 4 A.L.R. 1556 Facts Plaintiff was injured by a tack in her blueberry pie at the defendant‚Äôs restaurant. Pie was made by the defendant on its premises. Blueberries came in ordinary quart berry baskets, from which the tack was probably from. Procedural posture In the Supreme Court of MA‚Äîsame judge as in Friend v. Childs Dining Hall Co.. Issue Can a restaurant can be held liable under tort for serving food resulting in injury in the absence of evidence of negligence? Holding Not here. Analysis Court: *This is an action of tort. It rests solely on allegations of negligence. *It is well settled that the duty rests upon the keeper of an inn, restaurant, or other eating place to use due care to furnish wholesome food, fit to eat. Failure in this respect resulting in injury is the foundation for an action for negligence. *Court says that in this case, the defendant showed negligence *Court says that there is nothing in the record from which it can be inferred that the harm to the plaintiff resulted directly from any failure of duty on the part of the defendant. The precise cause of her injury is left to conjecture. Normally, under such circumstances, the plaintiff does not have the responsibility of proving the tort conduct on the defendant and the verdict should be directed accordingly. *The tack was small and black and would have easily escaped careful scrutiny. The carelessness of somebody the defendant was not responsible for might have caused the tack to be in the pie *The mere fact of injury does not show negligence. The burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff to establish that fact must be sustained by evidence either direct or inferential. Decision that led to appeal is sustained. Arguably, Friend abandoned her cause of action in tort because she thought of eating there as a sale under the St. 1908, c. 237 ¬ß15 Uniform Sales Act. Ash did not plead cause of action in contract because thought that it was a more clear-cut case of negligence (which falls under tort). I don‚Äôt think that it would have made a difference if they ate together. Ash v. Childs compared to Friend v. Childs: Ash has the better case. Nevertheless: Friend pursued a contract argument and won. Ash pursued a torts argument and lost. Friend originally pursued a tort argument but abandoned that. Ash probably didn‚Äôt pursue contract argument because there is a contract of privity of contract and Ash didn‚Äôt pay for the bill. Why didn‚Äôt Ash win? Failed to prove negligence- to win a product liability case in tort, you need to be able to prove negligence. Contract relieves you of that Statutory issue *Whether there was a sale or not, court decides there is sale *Whether there was an examination of goods, court decides it doesn‚Äôt apply here *Contributory negligence is not a defense; there was a contract in place  See also  * Friend v.

The story is based on the Greek myth of King Midas, albeit with a medieval setting.  Story  The extremely rich King Midas never cares for women nor wine and never gets enough of his gold, wishing one day that everything he touched would turn to gold. An elf named Goldie appears in front of him and offers him the Golden Touch, demonstrating its magical power by turning the king's cat to gold, then claps his hands and snaps his fingers to change it back. Midas tries to offer up everything he owns in exchange (\\"My gold, my kingdom, everything for the Golden Touch!\\"), but is warned by Goldie that \\"To you, the Golden Touch would prove a golden curse.\\" Midas however derides this -eventually exclaiming \\"Fiddlesticks! Give me gold, not advice!\\"- and Goldie gives him the Golden Touch (\\"I gave thee advice, now I give thee gold.\\"). At first Midas is happy about his newfound power. He turns his cat and several things in his garden to gold, then talks to himself in his mirror about turning the Earth and then the Universe to gold. But then he finds out he can neither eat nor drink anymore; even his bite turns a roast chicken to gold. Deprived of his food and fearing starvation, he asks himself in his mirror \\"Is the richest king in all the world to starve to death?\\". He hallucinates himself as a golden skeleton form in his mirror which nods in reply to his question. Horrified, Midas tries to flee the castle, but as he approaches the castle gate, he sees his shadow morph into a golden Grim Reaper, after which a terrified Midas flees back to his counting room where the short began. He summons the elf, crying, \\"Take away this golden curse, don't let me starve! Take everything, my gold, my kingdom for a hamburger sandwich!\\" Goldie agrees to take back the Golden Touch in exchange for everything Midas possesses, including his castle, his crown (replacing it with a tin can), and even his clothes (sparing only his undergarments). In return, Midas is given only the hamburger he begged for. Instead of bemoaning his poverty, Midas (first touching the burger to see if Goldie kept his word) devours the burger joyfully, grateful that it came with onions.  Production  The Golden Touch was an attempt by Walt Disney to direct a cartoon, which he had not done for five years. Disney had been criticizing his cartoon directors, and decided to direct the cartoon himself. The short itself was an immediate failure. Reasons included that the short was stiff and lethargically paced, and that Midas came off as too one-dimensional and too unsympathetic for audiences to care about him. As such, Walt immediately disowned the cartoon and forbade anybody from ever bringing it up around the studio. This failure was also so hard on him that he gave up directing cartoons altogether, stepping aside to become a full-time producer.

Early life and education Rosa Rios is the sixth of nine children born to Guadalupe Rios and raised in Hayward, California. Guadalupe raised all nine children on her own and with the support of their church, sent all of her children to Catholic schools and off to college. All nine children worked at a young age. Treasurer Rios worked full-time throughout high school at the office headquarters for the Alameda County Library System. She worked various jobs including ordering and processing books before they were sent to the branches. Treasurer Rios has frequently said that she had won the lottery with this job as she had access to any book she ever wanted to read. She worked long hours, often coming home late at night and working on her homework into the early morning hours. Rios graduated from Moreau Catholic High School in 1983. She attended Harvard University where she graduated with high honors. She received the Dean‚Äôs award as the founder of Cultural Rhythms and is one of the few U.S. recipients of the Silver Medal Award from the Royal Society of Arts in Britain. Rios was hired by General Reinsurance Corporation as a Commercial Property Underwriter to analyze risks of complex high-value commercial investments. She was based in the San Francisco office and worked for two years before pursuing her MBA at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. She continued her career in real estate finance in Silicon Valley for Blickman Turkus Commercial Real Estate until her transition to local government. Public career Rios was hired in 1994 by the City of San Leandro as a Development Specialist. She developed strong roots in business and government in Northern California and became an expert in economic development and redevelopment for the cities of Union City, and Fremont before moving on to Oakland in 2003 as the Director of Redevelopment and Economic Development for the City of Oakland. Although they were two separate departments, then-City Manager Robert Bobb combined the two at Rios‚Äô request in order to recruit her from the City of Fremont. She successfully established a redevelopment project area in West Oakland which provided tax increment financing to eliminate economic and physical blight. She was also the lead staff member for the Downtown Revitalization Project which included a proposal for a new ballpark for the Oakland A‚Äôs baseball team as part of a mixed-use development that also included residential, commercial, and entertainment uses. Consulting career In 2003, Rios became a principal partner at Red River Associates, a consulting firm specializing in economic development and project management. While at Red River, she teamed with the Assistant General Manager of Infrastructure to restructure the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission in preparation for the seismic retrofit of the Hetch Hetchy water system, one of the nation‚Äôs largest capital improvement programs. Robert Bobb, who was now at that time was serving as the City Administrator for Washington DC, recruited Rios to assist with the recruitment of the Montreal Expos to become the Washington Nationals in 2005 including the revitalization of the Anacostia waterfront. The following year, Rios became Managing Director of Investments for MacFarlane Partners, a real estate investment firm based in San Francisco. While there, she was responsible for the firm's urban investment and development programs throughout Northern California and consulting with local municipalities. In 2008, Rios was invited to collaborate in the efforts of the Obama campaign to secure the state of Virginia in the 2008 presidential elections. She developed a strategy using the fan base of the DC United soccer team to register Latinos in Virginia. Many have said that this was a key tipping point necessary for the victory of then-Senator Barack Obama to win the democratic vote for the first time since 1964 in his campaign to become the President of the United States. Rios was asked to be one of 23 finance professionals to join the Treasury-Federal Reserve transition team at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. On May 18, 2009, President Obama officially nominated Rios as the Treasurer of the United States and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 24, 2009. Treasurer of the United States Treasurer Rios signs her name officially at her swearing-in ceremony In May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Rios to be Treasurer of the United States and was confirmed by the Senate unanimously in July 2009. Rios was sworn in on August 20, 2009. She had previously provided her first signature to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for use on U.S. currency on August 6. At the request of Herb Allison, Assistant Secretary for the Office of Financial Stability, Rios was part of the team that created the housing programs mandated by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Rios was also part of the team that implemented the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act with an emphasis on the Build America Bonds (BAB) program. Under her leadership, Rios convened and trained state and local government officials and other stakeholders on how to access and utilize Build America Bonds to fund major infrastructure projects around the country and stimulate job creation and revitalize cities and states during the economic recovery. In her role as Treasurer of the United States, Treasurer Rios was the Chief Executive Officer of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the United States Mint, including Fort Knox. Her day-to-day responsibilities included overseeing all currency and coin production activities with almost 4,000-employees in eight facilities nationwide and an annual budget of approximately $5 billion. In the first five years of her tenure, she saved over $1 billion by implementing efficiencies and innovative concepts while meeting increased production demand and increasing employee morale at record levels. Treasurer Rios was the first Treasurer to ever have her portfolio which also included the Chair of the Advanced Counterfeiting Deterrence Steering Committee and Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury in the areas of community development and public engagement. Her signature currently appears on a record $1.2 trillion out of the $1.4 trillion in circulation worldwide. Her almost eight-year effort to redesign the nation‚Äôs currency included the first-ever nationwide public engagement process in the history of the federal government using a social media portal, roundtables and town halls. Treasurer Rios began pushing for the change soon after she joined the Obama Administration in 2009. Her presentation to then Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner went so well, she told CNN afterward, that she left the room convinced the cause was sailing forward.[2] Rios has said that it was during her time on the Treasury/Federal Reserve Transition Team in 2008 where the theme of Democracy during that era inspired her to pursue the concept. In April 2016, Treasury announced that women will be placed on the $5, $10 and $20 bills reflecting the theme of democracy. The concepts will be unveiled on August 26, 2020 in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment granting women the right to vote. Rios stepped down as Treasurer; her last day in office was July 8, 2016. Treasurer Rios was the longest serving Senate-confirmed Treasury official beginning with her time on the Treasury/Federal Reserve Transition Team in November 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. Empowerment 2020 After the end of her tenure at Treasury, Rios launched an organization called Empowerment 2020 at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, where she was working as a visiting scholar. Awards and honors Upon her resignation in 2016, she received the Hamilton Award, the highest honor bestowed in the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In April 2015, a portrait of Rios was unveiled at Winthrop House at Harvard University, where she lived as an undergraduate‚Äîit was the first portrait of a Hispanic female to hang on a wall in Harvard College. Rios was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 2019. Personal life Rios has two children, Joey and Brooke.

McDearmon and his wife Mary Frances Philadelphia (Walton) McDearmon. They had it built for them in 1854. It is registered in the U. S. National Register of Historic Places in 2002 as a contributing property as part of the Appomattox Historic District of Appomattox, Virginia.Appomattox Historic District 2002 Final Nomination form, Section 7 Page 7 History McDearmon went into bankruptcy in 1853 due to failures of his business dealings in his Clover Hill properties and other investments. Since the railroad was not going to have a depot stop in Clover Hill, as once was anticipated, that pretty much put the nails into the coffin as far as his village investments went. His land and business investments depended upon the railroad routing through the little village of Clover Hill.Marvel, pp. 35-42 McDearmon made up a \\"bankruptcy deed\\" that took up eight ledger pages that consisted of his properties. The trustees for the bankruptcy were his brother and brother-in-law. After a small commission for services they were to sell his properties for whatever the market would bring to settle his debts. The deed however had some exceptions. In the day before bankruptcy protections, his wife \\"refused to relinquish her right of dower\\" in his estate. He quitclaimed large valuable properties over to her name claiming to clear the titles of the remaining properties to sell off to pay creditors. By this process he was effectively reduced to owning nothing and having no debts. His wife however, was quite wealthy due to her \\"dower rights\\".In 1854 the McDearmons sold Mary F.P. McDearmon's interest in her father William Walton's landed estate of over 1000 acres, addressing some of McDearmon's indebtedness. Walton had died in 1851. Appomattox County Land Tax Records 1854. By the fall of 1854 the trustees for McDearmon's bankruptcy decided that his properties would at that time receive the maximum amount they could and advertised a sale on October 5, 1854.Lynchburg Virginian 2 October 1854. The Clover Hill tract was only deeded to J.W. Tibbs in 1856: Appomattox Land Tax Records 1854‚Äì1856. In this process the debts were settled and McDearmon's wife wound up with some near the vicinity of the new depot station located west of Clover Hill. He no longer could own property since it would be taken from him to settle his debts. His wife, however, could own property without jeopardy of losing it. Some say she retained her wealth through \\"dower rights,\\" while others say it was because of her husband's clandestine and shady business practices. The Appomattox history shows that McDearmon wanted to sell everything and move out west. The McDearmon couple gathered up their possessions at Clover Hill and started their venture west not knowing exactly where they were to wind up. McDearmon himself wanted to go to Nebraska, his wife Texas; he having relatives in Missouri while her sister Virginia (Walton) Nowlin (1825‚Äì1906) had recently moved to Texas. They relocated near the Appomattox Station, where they took up residence in a plain and modest six- room Virginia farmhouse some one hundred yards away. The house was eventually named the \\"Nebraska House\\" and the small town where the train stopped became officially the post office designation of Nebraska McDearmon's wry acknowledgement that he had stopped short of getting to his goal of Nebraska.Schroeder, p. 11 McDearmon sold his property in the village, reportedly hoping to move west to the Nebraska Territory. That dream never came to fruition and the McDearmons took up residence in a house near Appomattox Station and dubbed it \\"Nebraska\\".Marvel, pp. 42-43 McDearmon built a new six-room Virginia farmhouse on that land, within a hundred yards of the Appomattox depot, and the couple moved in that summer; the colonel quickly suppressed any dreams he may have harbored about Texas or Nebraska.Marvel, p. 43 When the news circulated that McDearmon's advertised journey from Clover Hill had ended at the railroad, smirking yeomen and gentry alike began calling the depot vicinity \\"Nebraska.\\" That winter the postmaster general formally recognized a community of that name and appointed the unembarrassed McDearmon as its first postmaster.... Marvel identifies no yeomen or gentry as contemporary evidence of \\"smirking.\\"N.R. Featherston, History of Appomattox (Walsworth, Marceline Mo: 1948) p.14: Tradition has it that [McDearmon]...began his journey, and on reaching the present Appomattox Court House ... located here, and had the post office at this place named \\"Nebraska\\"....Appomattox County Virginia (Walsworth, Summersville WVa: 2001 p.5: Samuel McDearmon ... wanted to move with his wife to Nebraska ....

McDearmon's contemptuous comment on a move she had not wanted to make. After McDearmon died in 1871 the \\"Nebraska House\\" was acquired by John R. Atwood who had been a clerk in McDearmon's store in the small village of Nebraska, Virginia. Atwood died in 1912 and his wife moved out and went back to Richmond where she lived when she was young before their marriage. Later, in 1925 she sold the house to C.S. McDearmon (1871‚Äì1956), a grandson of the original owner, therefore returning it to the McDearmon family. The house then remained in the McDearmon family until it was purchased in 1993 by a retired airline pilot.Schroeder, p. 12  Description  The original house the McDearmons had constructed was a 2-story structure consisting of six rooms which is the back part of the present house. It presently is a -story Victorian masion.Appomattox Historic District 2002 Final Nomination form, Section 7 Pages 37-38 Atwood and his wife remodeled the residence in 1872 with major improvements after their acquisition of the house. It then became a Queen Anne style architecture in the United States style, popular in the nineteenth century. Sometime after 1896 the house went through another remodel with the columns, porch rails and gingerbread trim replaced with fluted columns. This gave the outside of the house a Greek Revival architecture style appearance.The Nebraska House history Nebraska House in the late 1890s. John Atwood (center) with wife (right).

History She was built in 1911 by William Gray & Company, Ltd., West Hartlepool, England, with engines by the company's Central Marine Engine Works. On 23 or 24 April 1928 (sources differ), the ship ran into the Second Narrows Bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and lost her funnel and masts.  Wreck  In November 1929, Norwich City, carrying a crew of 35, left Melbourne bound for Vancouver via Honolulu. During a storm on 29 November, the unladen freighter ran aground in darkness on the reef at the northwest end of the small central Pacific atoll known as Gardner Island. A fire broke out in the engine room, and all hands abandoned ship in darkness, having to make their way across the wide and dangerous coral reef being pounded by dangerous storm waves. In total, 11 men lost their lives. The survivors camped near collapsed structures from a late 19th-century coconut- planting project and were rescued after several days on the island. The devastated wreck of the Norwich City was a prominent landmark on the reef for 70 years, though by 2007, only the ship's keel, engine, and two large tanks remained. By 2010, only the engine remained above water on the reef. In 2016, storm activity washed one of the two large tanks shoreward and the two-story engine was broken off and dropped over the edge of the reef into deep water.TIGHAR Earhart Project Research Bulletin #80, January 9, 2017.

During World War I, he was drafted in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the war, he studied law at the universities of Zagreb and Ljubljana, where he obtained his PhD in 1930. Until 1935, he had a law firm in Ljubljana. Krek joined the conservative Catholic Slovene People's Party in 1921. Initially, he served in the Party's auxiliary cultural associations. He also served as the president of the Slovenian section of the Catholic Action, and chief editor of the main conservative newspaper Slovenec. During the royal dictatorship of king Alexander I of Yugoslavia, he served as vice-president of the party. In 1936, he became minister without portfolio in the cabinet of Milan Stojadinoviƒá. In 1938, he was elected Member of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on the list of the Yugoslav Radical Community, of which the Slovene People's Party was part between 1935 and 1941. In December of the same year, he became Minister of Constructions. He maintained the ministry in the government of Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá, formed after Stojadinoviƒá's downfall in February 1939. In 1940, he was named Minister of Education in the Cvetkoviƒá-Maƒçek coalition government. After the death of Anton Koro≈°ec, Krek became General Secretary of the Yugoslav Radical Community in the Drava Banovina, and thus the second most influential politician in the Slovene People's Party after Fran Kulovec. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Krek emigrated to Palestine and then to London, as a member of the Yugoslav Government in Exile, led by Du≈°an Simoviƒá.

During this time, he published several manifestos urging the Slovenes, without much success, to join the Chetnik resistance movement of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá. He also maintained contacts with the Slovene non-Communist underground resistance, known as the Slovene Covenant. In 1944, he opposed the Tito-≈†uba≈°iƒá Agreement, with which the Yugoslav government in exile recognized the Yugoslav partisans. The same year, he moved to Rome, where he organized the Slovenian National Council Abroad, which was opposed to the Communist-led Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. In May and June 1945, he tried unsuccessfully to prevent the re-patriation of the Slovene Home Guard to Yugoslavia. In September of the same year, he co-authored a manifesto titled \\"Tito's Government is Introducing Totalitarianism\\", together with the leader of the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia ≈Ωivko Topaloviƒá and the leader of the Independent Democratic Party Adam Pribiƒáeviƒá.Jera Vodu≈°ek Stariƒç, Kako su komunisti osvojili vlast -1944. - 1926..

He laid many of the roads in Westchester County, New York and was known as \\"The Asphalt King\\". Early life Amzi Barber was born on June 22, 1843 in Saxtons River, Vermont. He was the son of Amzi Doolittle Barber (1810‚Äì1901), a pastor of the Congregationalist Church,Men of the Century and Nancy Irene Bailey. He grew up in Ohio and attended Oberlin College, graduating in 1867. Career After graduating from college, he briefly considered following his father's vocation in the ministry, but instead took a teaching position at Howard University. At Howard, he was \\"Principal of Normal and Preparatory Department\\" as well as Professor of Natural Philosophy and Acting Professor of Mathematics until his resignation in 1873. He graduated from Columbian University in Washington, DC in 1877. In late August 1902, the newly formed Consolidated National Bank elected Amzi L. Barber, Lyman G. Bloomingdale, and James Newcomb as directors. =Real estate development= 1880 map of LeDroit ParkIn 1873, abandoning teaching, Barber developed LeDroit Park, a neighborhood adjacent to Howard University with his brother-in-law, Andrew Langdon (d. 1919). He named the neighborhood after his father-in-law, LeDroict Langdon, but left out the (c) in his name. It was one of the first suburbs of Washington, and was developed and marketed as a \\"romantic\\" neighborhood with narrow tree-lined streets that bore the same names as the trees that shaded them, differing from the street names used in the rest of the city. Extensive focus was placed on the landscaping of this neighborhood, as developers spent a large sum of money to plant flower beds and trees to attract high-profile professionals from the city. It was originally a whites-only neighborhood and was gated with guards to promote the security for its residents. In July 1888, students tore down the fences that separated the neighborhood in protest of its discriminating policies. In 1875, he developed the Le Droit Building at 800 F Street Northwest in Washington, D.C., across the street from the Old Patent Office Building, which in 2016 houses the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. As of 2004, the building houses the International Spy Museum. In 1892, he bought the property known as \\"Ardsley Towers\\" in Irvington, NY. The property was built by Cyrus W. Field for his son, whose financial difficulties made a sale of the property necessary. He developed the property into Ardsley Park and Ardsley Country Club. =Asphalt business= In 1878, he became actively involved with asphalt pavement work with his brother-in-law John J. Albright, a Buffalo industrialist. In 1880, Barber partnered with U.S. Senator John Sherman for the purchase and sale of the \\"Stone\\" property, then on the outskirts of Washington D.C. This led to an interest in asphalt for paving city streets, after a government study determined it to be the best available method. He incorporated Barber Asphalt Paving Co. in 1883 to produce asphalt, and in 1887, secured a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake in Trinidad, the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. He was also managing director of Trinidad Lake Asphalt Co., Limited, incorporated in London in 1898. Barber moved the Washington-based business to New York City, and it continued to expand, becoming, against Barber's wishes, part of an asphalt trust. By 1900, he had laid over 12 million square yards of Trinidad asphalt pavement in 70 American cities at a cost of $35 million. Barber retired from the business in 1901, just before the trust collapsed, but returned to the industry in 1904. =Locomobile= Locomobile model circa 1900 Barber also had an interest in automobile production, forming the Locomobile Company in 1898. The company at first produced small Stanley Steamer motor cars, which they initially sold for $600, with sales peaking at 1,600 cars in 1900.\\"1899 Locomobile Stanhope Style 1\\" Locomobile later transitioned into selling internal-combustion automobiles. Personal life In 1868, Barber married his first wife, Celia M. Bradley of Geneva, Ohio, who died shortly thereafter in 1870. In 1871, he married Julia Louise Langdon (1844‚Äì1912) of Belmont, New York. Julia was first cousins with Olivia Langdon Clemens (1845‚Äì1904), the wife of Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835‚Äì1910), also known as Mark Twain. With Julia, he had five children, of which four reached adulthood: LeDroit, Lorena, Bertha, and Rowland. Barber died of pneumonia in April 1909 at the age of 66 at his home \\"Ardsley Towers\\" in Ardsley-on-Hudson, New York. At the time of his death, The New York Times estimated his wealth at \\"many millions.\\"\\"Amzi L. Barber Dies of Pneumonia\\" The New York Times (April 19, 1909) =Residences and hobbies= 871 Fifth AvenueAs part of the purchase of the Stone\\" property in 1880, Barber reserved the best piece of the property for his own use, and in 1886, commissioned architect Theophilus P. Chandler to design an imposing ch√¢teauesque Queen Anne mansion made of stone. It was located between 13th and 14th Streets and was one of Washington's most impressive mansions. Barber named it Belmont,Belmont, from Flickr after his second wife's hometown. In 1913, Belmont was sold by his son to developer Harry Wardman and razed in 1915 to allow for construction of the Clifton Terrace Apartments. In 1889, he purchased the Cunard place on Staten Island, which he lived in during the summer with his family for four seasons. In 1891, he purchased the Robert L. Stuart mansion at 871 Fifth Avenue at Sixty-eight street in New York after the death of Stuart's widow, where his family spent part of each winter. The home on Fifth Avenue was later sold to William Collins Whitney around 1897. In 1906, Barber an avid yachtsman, bought a 269-foot boat named the T.S.Y. Lorena, after his daughter. The yacht had a crew of 44 and comfortably held around 12 passengers. The United States government bought it from him for use in the First World War, and then scrapped it after the war.

She was the third child and only daughter of Duke Casimir of Bytom by his wife Helena, whose origins are unknown, although the later historiography tends to recognize her as a daughter of Lev I of Galicia, from the Rurikid dynasty.The identification of Duchess Helena of Bytom as daughter of Lev I of Halicz (further explained in K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, vol. III, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, pp. 517‚Äì518) has been accepted and developed by Stanis≈Çaw Sroka, it tended to Jerzy Sperka and J. Tƒôgowski. See also D.

Barciak (ed.), KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôta i ksiƒô≈ºne G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska, Katowice 1995, pp. 47‚Äì48, who in another study researcher reiterated this hypothesis, while recognizing this was the equivalent to the repeated view of a Rurikid origin to Helena in the Halicz branch. See: J. Horwat, Piastowie g√≥rno≈õlƒÖscy, Bytom 2007, pp. 37‚Äì41, here are exposed other hypotheses who attributed Helena a Lithuanian or Czech origin. See. S.A. Sroka, Kazimierz, [in:] K. O≈º√≥g, S. Szczur (red.), Piastowie. Leksykon biograficzny, Krak√≥w 1999, p. 725. Maria was the first or second wifeThe previous position is currently shared by all Polish literature. Hungarian historian Gyula Krist√≥, in his work K√°roly R√≥bert els≈ë feles√©ge, [in:] Acta Universitatis Szegediensis de Attila J√≥zsef nominatae. Acta Historica, vol. 86, 1988, pp. 27‚Äì30 (followed by the native historiography), spoke in favor of the theory of a previous marriage of Charles I Robert with Maria, daughter of Lev II of Galicia. He supported this view in two sources. In a document dated 7 February 1326 Charles I Robert mentioned a trip to Russia with the purpose to bring his first wife, and the Anonymi Descriptio Europae Orientalis, who reported that the Russian ruler of Galicia had a daughter who married King Charles of Hungary. Gy. Krist√≥ has identified this Russian ruler as Lev II of Galicia. In his work Aba S√°muel √©s K√°roly R√≥bert csal√°di kapcsolatair√≥l, [in:] Acta Universitatis Szegediensis de Attila J√≥zsef nominatae. Acta Historica, vol. 96, 1996, pp. 25‚Äì30, Gy. Krist√≥ cited a document dated 12 December 1323, where he found that the Galician princess's name was Maria. According to his investigations, this marriage took place in 1306, although originally was presumed that could take place in 1307 or 1308. The marriage of Charles I Robert and Maria of Bytom was placed in 1310. The view of Gy. Krist√≥ was questioned by S. Sroka in his work Wok√≥≈Ç maria≈ºu Karola Roberta z Piast√≥wnƒÖ ≈õlƒÖskƒÖ MariƒÖ, [in:] G√≥rzy≈Ñski S. (ed.), Biuletyn Polskiego Towarzystwa Heraldycznego, No. 11, London, 1994, pp. 1-5. The historian drew attention to the fact that, according to current findings, in 1306 Lev II was at most 14 years old, so was impossible that he could fathered at that point a growing up princess. Also, he rejected the possibility that the alleged father of Maria of Galicia could be Lev II, pointed that any daughter of a Prince with the notoriety and prestige that the Kings of Galicia-Volhynia had at that time, must to be married in early youth or be placed in a monastery. In order to justify the theory who established Maria of Bytom as the first wife of Charles I Robert, S. Sroka proposed a new interpretation of the sources exposed by Gy. Krist√≥. According to an anonymous researcher in the Europy Wschodniej (and published by O. G√≥rka), the wife of Charles I Robert wasn't the daughter but granddaughter of a King of Galicia (Duchess Helena, Maria's mother, was probably the daughter of Lev I of Galicia). Also, Sroka presumed in the 1326 document, Charles I Robert could confused Poland with Russia, who could be easily explained for the almost twenty years of distance between the events mentioned and the document. However, Sroka (with K. Jasi≈Ñski) admitted the possibility that Maria of Bytom could be raised in the court of her uncle Yuri I of Galicia, and Charles I Robert take her from there to Hungary. In addition, Sroka denied the theory that the Hungarian document issued by Queen Maria dated 23 June 1306 was issued by Maria of Galicia, presenting the following arguments in favor of the identification of the Hungarian Queen as Maria of Bytom: The unusual elevation of taxes made by Duke Casimir of Bytom over his lands around the previous year, probably with the purpose of obtaining for her daughter's wedding; the date of 1306 as the year of the marriage of Charles I Robert and Maria of Bytom, mentioned in the Chronicle of Jan D≈Çugosz; and the complete absence of 14th century Hungarian chronicles who mentioned the death of Maria of Galicia. Moreover, Sroka pointed out that the Hungarian chronicles called a Silesian princess of the Piast dynasty as the first wife of the King of Hungary. Gy. Krist√≥ rebated the findings and arguments of S. Sroka. In the work Orosz hercegn≈ë volt-e K√°roly R√≥bert els≈ë feles√©ge?, [In:] Aetas, 1994, No 1, pp 194‚Äì199, he stated that the message showed in the Anonymi Descriptio Europae Orientalis concerns about Prince Lev of Galicia, could only refers to Lev II, because at the time of the established date of the creation of this document (February‚ÄìMarch 1308) the only surviving Rurikid prince with this name was a Lev II. The historian pointed out, however, that at this time the Principality of Galicia was ruled by his father, Yuri I. Contrary to previous literature, he assumed that Lev II was born about 1273 from an unknown first marriage of Yuri I, under the assumption that Yuri I (born in the years 1252-1257 according to Nicolas de Baumgarten, G√©n√©alogies occidentaux Mariages et des Russes du Rurikides au Xe si√®cle XIII, [in:] Orientalia Christiana, Volume IX-1, no 35, Rome 1927, tab. 11) couldn't be married for the first time with 30 years-old. Under this assumption Leo II in 1306 could have a daughter at the right age to marry. Arguments Gy. Kristo did not convince S. Sroka. This same disagreed with the proposition that the passage of Anonymi Descriptio Europae Orientalis could refers to the Galician ruler Lev lived at the time. In addition, he noted that at this time Leo II wasn't the powerful ruler depicted here, and even he didn't held no power. An alliance with the Galician branch of the Rurikid dynasty at this point was useless for Charles I Robert in his fight for the Hungarian crown, contrary to an alliance with W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. The historian, however, presented another hypothesis in order to explain the 1326 of Charles I Robert: he supposed that in fact the King when to Russia and became engaged with the Galician princess, but for unknown reasons the marriage never took place.

This union was childless, but older literature claimed that they had two daughters. Little is known about the activities of Mary as Queen of Hungary. Her marriage to Charles I Robert consolidated the Polish-Hungarian agreement directed against the Kingdom of Bohemia, and also helped to establish a close Polish-Hungarian relations in the 14th century,S.A. Sroka, Z dziej√≥w stosunk√≥w polsko-wƒôgierskich w p√≥≈∫nym ≈õredniowieczu.

Jasi≈Ñski, Maria, [in:] E. Rostworowski (red.), Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, vol. XX, Wroc≈Çaw 1975, p. 3. LifeBirth= The exact date of birth of Maria is unknown. In 1306, when she was married to Charles Robert, contemporary Canon Law established that the minimal age for marriage must be at least 12 years old; thus, she was born in 1294 at the latest.K. Jasi≈Ñski, in his work Maria [in:] E. Rostworowski (red.), Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Volume XX, Wroclaw 1975, p. 3, didn't give the birth date of the Bytom princess. However, in his later work Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, Mon. III, p. 534, stated that she was born between 1292 and no later than 1294, and in Table V/2 at the end of the Rodow√≥d wrote that Maria was born before 1295, and that date has affixed a question mark; S. Sroka, Z dziej√≥w stosunk√≥w polsko-wƒôgierskich w p√≥≈∫nym ≈õredniowieczu. Szkice, Krak√≥w 1995, p. 38, determined that Maria was born between the years 1292-1294, but in the work, Maria, [in:] K. O≈º√≥g, S. Szczur (red.), Piastowie. Leksykon biograficzny, Krak√≥w 1999, p. 736, he said that the birth took place about 1290-1292, while in the work Genealogia Andegawen√≥w wƒôgierskich, Krak√≥w 1999, p. 17, he spoke in favor of a date ranked between 1292-1294; J. Sperka, Maria, [in:] A. Barciak (red.), KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôta i ksiƒô≈ºne G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska, Katowice 1995, p. 86, ranked erroneously the birth date of Maria between 1282-1284; J. Horwat, Z.

Jasi≈Ñski in the Table V of Rodowodu Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich and stated that Maria was born about 1295. She was the first member of the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty named Maria;K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, mon. III, p. 534. reasons for this suggestion of name are also unknown. Among the children of Casimir of Bytom she was usually placed in the sixth and last place, but she could even be born as the third child, in turn. =Queen= Information about the wedding of Maria and Charles I Robert of Hungary was shown in the chronicle of Jan D≈Çugosz, who reported two different dates for this event: 1306 and 1310.K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, mon. III, p. 534 and p. 535, note 3. The first date is generally accepted by the majority of historians: as proof, the first known document who called Maria Queen of Hungary was dated 23 June 1306; in addition, the official Hungarian documents from 1306 explicitly named her as Queen. Finally, it's anticipated that the loan 140 pieces of fine silver dragged around 1305 by Casimir of Bytom were used to cover the costs of the wedding of Maria and Charles I Robert.S.A. Sroka, Genealogia Andegawen√≥w wƒôgierskich, Krak√≥w 1999, p. 18. In both reports about the wedding, D≈Çugosz mentions the beauty of Maria, stating that the Silesian Piast princess was a \\"very pretty girl\\"J. D≈Çugosz, Roczniki czyli kroniki s≈Çawnego Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego, fr. IX, ed. II, Warsa 2009, p. 53. and \\"the girl famous for her extraordinary beauty\\".J. D≈Çugosz, Roczniki czyli kroniki s≈Çawnego Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego, fr. IX, ed. II, Warsa 2009, p. 80.J. Horwat, Z. Jedynak, C√≥rka Kazimierza ksiƒôcia bytomskiego, Maria, kr√≥lowa Wƒôgier, [in:] J. Drabina (red.), Magazyn Bytomski, vol. 6, Bytom 1984, p. 90, pointed that D≈Çugosz information about Maria's beauty could be reliable, arguing that as a King of an important state Charles I Robert could receive many offers of marriage. The marriage was probably on the initiative of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high (first- cousin of Maria's fatherThe mother of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, Euphrosyne of Opole, and the paternal grandfather of Maria, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski, are siblings.), and the role of matchmaker was played by her brother Boles≈Çaw, then Scholastic of Krak√≥w and Duke of Toszek. The wedding ceremony took place probably in Bytom, the homeland of the bride.J. Horwat, Z. Jedynak, C√≥rka Kazimierza ksiƒôcia bytomskiego, Maria, kr√≥lowa Wƒôgier, [in:] J. Drabina (red.), Magazyn Bytomski, vol. 6, Bytom 1984, pp. 90-91 and note 4. After arriving to Hungary and in accordance with the almost century-old custom, Maria was crowned Queen of Hungary by Benedict II, Bishop of Veszpr√©m in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. This union was the external expression of the approximation between the Polish and Hungarian kingdoms, connected to the transition of the House of Anjou politics in close political relations with Poland. In addition, the Duchy of Bytom, now closely associated to the anti-Czech party, could get out of its feudal relationship with the Kingdom of Bohemia.J. Horwat, Z. Jedynak, C√≥rka Kazimierza ksiƒôcia bytomskiego, Maria, kr√≥lowa Wƒôgier, [in:] J. Drabina (red.), Magazyn Bytomski, vol. 6, Bytom 1984, p. 90, speculated that the refusal of homage of Casimir of Bytom to the Kingdom of Bohemia had an impact in the political orientation of King Wenceslaus II in his feudal lands. After this he began to send troops to Silesian, even led by himself. Charles I Robert also strengthened his position as competitor for the Hungarian throne against Otto III of Bavaria thanks to his marriage, because (as was assumed by historians), his wife was closely related to the House of Arpad: Maria's mother Helena was granddaughter of King Bela IV of Hungary through her mother.K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, mon. III, p. 518. The position of Maria as Queen of Hungary also paved the way for the subsequent career in the Hungarian church of his brothers Boles≈Çaw (later Archbishop of Esztergom) and Mieszko (later Bishop of Nitra and Veszpr√©m). Little is known about the role of Maria in the Hungarian royal court. There are only two documents issued by it. The first, from 1312, has survived until today together with the stamp. The content of the second, from 9 April 1313, is known as the confirmation of the Chapter in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. The obverse of the seal's image of Maria showed the Queen sitting on a throne with floral envelope and the letter M and A in both sides, while positioned on the back of the customary double cross and the letters Angevin RI and A between her shoulders. The letters on both sides of the seal consists of the name of the queen. Maria died on 15 December 1317H. Grotefend, Stammtafeln der schlesischen F√ºrsten bis zum Jahre 1740, vol. V, No. 18, established Maria's death on 15 December 1315. This date was supported by O. Balzer, Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895, p. 377; J. DƒÖbrowski, El≈ºbieta ≈Åokietk√≥wna 1305‚Äì1380, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, p. 16 and p. 34, citing the work of Grotefend and Balzer, said that Maria died in 1315; In Jan D≈Çugosz, Roczniki czyli kroniki s≈Çawnego Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego, vol. IX, ed. II, Warsaw 2009, p. 122, note. 9, there is an information that the chronicler gave the wrong date of death of Maria. According to the editor Maria of Bytom died on 19 December 1317, after which he refers in p. 53, note 77, that the Hungarian Queen died on 9 December 1317, and the date of 19 December was false, unsubstantiated by any source. S.A. Sroka, Z dziej√≥w stosunk√≥w polsko-wƒôgierskich w p√≥≈∫nym ≈õredniowieczu. Szkice, Krak√≥w 1995, pp. 45‚Äì46, note 92, pointed that Maria was a living person in a documented issued by Charles I Robert dated 2 July 1318. Most likely, the creation date of this document wasn't accurate, because since 23 June of that year the Hungarian King was engaged to Beatrice of Luxembourg. See S.A.

Drabina (red.), Magazyn Bytomski, vol. 6, Bytom 1984, p. 92 and note 9, wrongly quoted D≈Çugosz, stating that Maria was buried in Belgrade, and K. Jasi≈Ñski, in the Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, stated that the Queen of Hungary was buried in came to rest in Temesv√°r. in the Basilica of the Virgin Mary, according to the reports of Jan D≈Çugosz.J. D≈Çugosz, Roczniki czyli kroniki s≈Çawnego Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego, vol. IX, ed. II, Warsaw 2009, p. 122. The Polish chronicler confirms this facts with the Hungarian sources, but they provide three different dates of Maria's death: 1315, 1316 or 1317. The third date is now accepted as the definitive one thanks to a document issued by Charles I Robert dated 24 February 1317, in which Maria is still mentioned as a living person. The resulting differences about the date in documents in charters could be explained as a mistake of the writer, who didn't place correctly the last number ‚Äì rather than MCCCXVII he wrote MCCCXV and MCCCXVI.K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, mon. III, p. 535, note 5. The picture of her funeral placed at the head of this article was a miniature of the Chronicon Pictum, who was currently preserved in the National Library in Budapest. After the death of Maria, Charles I Robert married Beatrice of Luxembourg in 1318, who died the following year in childbirth, and married lastly Elizabeth of Kujavia in 1320, who finally bore him the needed male- heirs of the dynasty. Issue The union between Maria and Charles I Robert was childless, probably because of the Queen's infertility. Older literature attributed to this union two daughters:J. DƒÖbrowski, El≈ºbieta ≈Åokietk√≥wna 1305‚Äì1380, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, p. 16 and note 4, pp. 36‚Äì37.

Some believe that Catherine was the only daughter of King Charles I Robert. The existence of this two daughters as offspring of Maria of Bytom, supported by a group of Polish and foreign historians, headed by the genealogist W≈Çodzimierz Dworzaczek, was recently challenged and rejected by historians.K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich, ed. II, Krak√≥w 2007, mon. II, pp. 322‚Äì324 and mon. III, pp. 551‚Äì552; See also K. Jasi≈Ñski, Maria, [in:] E. Rostworowski (red.), Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, vol. XX, Wroc≈Çaw 1975, p. 3. During Maria's lifetime, her husband had an illegitimate son, Coloman, born by the end of 1317 or early in 1318. The mother was a certain Guze (or Elisabeth) Cs√°k, a daughter of George Cs√°k. This son followed a Church career, and was in Bishop of Gy≈ër from 1337 to 1375.

Drake Bros. Co.,Full text in google books (open source) 235 N.Y. 468, 139 N.E. 576 (1922), was a products liability case before the New York Court of Appeals. The Court held that a plaintiff cannot recover from a defendant based on implied warranty when she does not have contractual privity with him; thus, a plaintiff cannot recover from a defendant who sold her employer food unfit for consumption, because the defendant's implied warranty extended only to the employer. Chysky is part of a progression of cases that influenced the products liability synthesis that emerged early in the century. The Chysky case reflects a refinement of Judge Cardozo's argument in MacPherson v Buick Motor Co. that a person could be liable for a defective product to someone other than the immediate purchaser. In Chysky, Cardozo joined Judge McLaughlin's opinion, which relied on Cardozo's statement in MacPherson that the basis of liability in that case was in tort, not contract. \\"If the exceptions expressed in MacPherson had been a smokescreen for the basic principle that a producer of a defective product would be liable to anyone who might be expected to use it, Cardozo would have applied the MacPherson principles to permit the waitress to recover regardless of her choice not to sue in tort. Yet Cardozo joined the majority that ruled against the waitress, not Judge Hogan's silent dissent.\\" Brief of caseFacts= Plaintiff's employer gave her a piece of cake that had been made and sold to him by the defendant. There was a nail in a cake that struck her gum, causing it to be infected to the extent that three teeth needed to be removed. Plaintiff sued the person who sold the cake to her employer, upon the theory that he was liable to her since he had implicitly warranted (when he sold the cake to her employer) that it was fit for human consumption. =Issue= Does the provision of the Uniform Sales Act ¬ß15(1) that provides, :‚Äúthere is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract to sell or a sale, except as follows: 1. Where the BUYER expressly or by implication makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the BUYER relies on the seller‚Äôs skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose‚Äù include a third party who does not have privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied? =Holding= No, said the Court of Appeals. The provision does not include a third party who does not have privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied. If there is no privity of contract between third persons and the seller of food, there can be no implied warranty. The benefit of warranty (either express or implied) does not run with the chattel on its resale (and thus is unlike a covenant running with land, which does give a subsequent purchaser a right of action on a warranty). =Reasoning= The Court of appeals reasoned: *In Rinaldi v. Mohican Co., the cause of action arose after the section of the Personal Property Law quoted took effect. Court held that ‚Äúthe mere purchase by a customer from a retail dealer in foods of an article ordinarily used for human consumption does by implication make known to the vendor the purpose for which the article is used.‚Äù *In the case at hand, the plaintiff received the cake from her employer, who bought the cake from the defendant. Defendant is not liable to the plaintiff for her injuries because there was no contract between her and the defendant. The general rule is that a manufacturer or seller of food or other articles of personal property is not liable to third persons under an implied warranty. If there is no privity of contract, there is no implied warranty. Notes The plaintiff could have sued in tort rather than in contract (implied warranty), but plaintiff limited her right to recover to a breach of warranty. This indicates the continued relevance of privity in employment cases.

He competed at four Paralympic Games; Stoke Mandeville, England (1984), Seoul, South Korea (1988), Barcelona, Spain (1992) and Atlanta, United States (1996), as well as two Commonwealth Games; Auckland, New Zealand (1990) and Victoria, British Columbia (1994). Personal history Born in Derbyshire, Hallam was raised in Cwmbran, South Wales. He attended Llantarnam School, where he became a competitive swimmer, with aspirations of competing for Wales. A motorcycle accident at age 17 (en route to a training session) resulted in him becoming a wheelchair user. After rehabilitation he spent some time living and travelling in South Africa, before returning to the UK and becoming involved in wheelchair sport. He later studied for his undergraduate and MBA degrees at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff. In 2002 he became a Winston Churchill Fellow writing his report on the access of disabled people to specialist training equipment and gyms. Although a successful kidney transplant in 1996 (with a living donation from his father), in latter years he experienced ill health. He was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2011 and received chemotherapy treatment. He died on 16 August 2013, aged 50, and was survived by his parents (John and Anne) and a sister (Julie). Hallam was the subject of episode 1 of the 2019 BBC series Mavericks: Sport's Lost Heroes. Sporting career In 1984 he won a gold medal for the 50m breast stroke, but it was on the track and road where he had the biggest impact. He won a bronze medal in the 400m in Seoul, and repeated this in the 100m in Barcelona. During his career he held world records in the 100m and 200m. He twice pushed his way around Wales (in 1987, 1997) with his training partner and fellow Paralympian John Harris, to raise money for a purpose built wheelchair-accessible training centre at Cyncoed, Cardiff. He won the London marathon twice, and broke the course record both times, in 1985 and 1987. (1985: 2.19.53, and 1987: 2.08.34) He won the Great North Run on four occasions (1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990). He competed at two Commonwealth Games, in New Zealand (1990), and in Victoria, British Columbia (1994), respectively, as well as World and European Championships. Chris took the bronze medal at the 100m wheelchair race during the 1992 paralympics in Barcelona As an administrator he organised several National events, and was Chairman of the British Wheelchair Racing Association from 1990 to 1992. In his coaching career he worked with several successful British athletes including Rose Hill, the British Record Holder for the marathon, and Dan Lucker who became world junior champion.

Actives/Dolls The Actives from the Los Angeles Dollhouse are given names derived from the NATO phonetic alphabet. =Echo= Echo (Eliza Dushku), formerly Caroline Farrell, is an Active and protagonist of the series. She is one of the most popular Actives in the Dollhouse and, during the course of her engagements, has shown skills that transcend the limitations of her parameters. Echo has become increasingly self-aware during her blank state, remembering facets of her previous engagements, recognizing that she can be imprinted with different personalities, and remembering facts from her previous life such as her name. Prior to having her mind wiped, Echo was a college activist named Caroline Farrell who attempted to expose the Rossum Corporation. =Sierra= Sierra (Dichen Lachman), real name Priya Tsetsang, is an Active in the Los Angeles Dollhouse. Priya is Chinese-Australian, though she frequently has an American accent in her mind-wiped state. In her mind- wiped state, she is instinctively drawn to Echo but lacks Echo's self- awareness. Before coming to the Dollhouse, she sold her own artwork at a stall on Venice Beach. She was seduced by Nolan Kinnard, a Rossum Corporation researcher, who commissioned her to do a large painting. At a showing of her art in Kinnard's house, he made advances towards her at the show, but she publicly rejected him. Humiliated and discouraged, he began giving her antipsychotic drugs, which induced a paranoid schizophrenic state. She was then transferred to a mental health clinic, before being inducted into the Dollhouse. During her time in the Dollhouse, Sierra fell in love with Victor, a fellow Doll. =Victor= Victor (Enver Gjokaj), formerly Anthony Ceccoli, is an Active who has made friends with Echo and Sierra. He is an Afghanistan War veteran whose PTSD was cured by the Dollhouse. The character is introduced as Russian gangster Lubov, whose real identity as a Doll is revealed later. The character is also regularly hired out on romantic engagements for one \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\". Prior to the Dollhouse, Victor seems to be a baseball fan, as he is able to recite the entire New York Mets line-up in \\"Needs\\". In his mind-wiped state, he is inexplicably attracted, physically and emotionally, to Sierra. His handler's name is Selena Ramirez. In \\"Briar Rose\\", he suffers facial cuts similar to Dr. Saunders after Alpha invades the Dollhouse. In the early episodes of the second season, however, surgery has removed all the scars from his face. His romantic attraction to Sierra continues to recur both in his blank states and personas throughout season two. His origin is revealed in \\"Stop-Loss\\", where his five-year contract with the Dollhouse expires and he is released into his original identity; Rossum, however, kidnaps him for their private army of supersoldier ex-Actives. Echo and Priya save him from the Rossum training facility, and all three are condemned to \\"the Attic.\\" They later escape and solidify their alliance with Adelle DeWitt, Boyd Langton, Paul Ballard and Topher Brink against Rossum's ambitions. =Whiskey= Whiskey (Amy Acker) was the number one Doll before her face was scarred by Alpha so that Echo could take the top spot. To accommodate the loss of their existing physician and to not let the damaged Doll go to waste, Topher created the identity Claire Saunders for Whiskey. After some taunting from Alpha and through computer skills she was mysteriously imprinted with, Claire was able to realize she is really Whiskey. She did not express an interest to discover who she was prior to this, proclaiming, \\"I know who I am.\\" Three months later, in \\"Vows\\", she is seen pulling pranks on Topher. She eventually tries to seduce him, but is rejected. The two discuss her identity as Claire Saunders, and how Topher tried to make her as a foil to himself so they could see each other's mistakes to reduce the chance that \\"someone would get hurt\\". At the end of the episode, she is seen driving away from the Dollhouse, despite her fear of the outside world. She returns to the dollhouse in \\"Getting Closer\\", claiming to have been with Boyd for the past few months. Later in the episode, she fatally shoots Bennett Halverson then calmly walks away, leaving the Dollhouse and causing Ballard and Echo to conclude that Rossum imprinted her as a sleeper active. In \\"The Hollow Men\\", she reveals that she has been imprinted as Clyde Randolph. In the future events of 2019 seen in \\"Epitaph One\\", Whiskey remains in the abandoned Dollhouse, seemingly as its benign caretaker, having reverted to her Doll- state. By this time, she has lost her scars. =November= November (Miracle Laurie), whose real name is Madeline Costley, is originally introduced to the series as Mellie, the neighbor, romantic interest, and confidante of Paul Ballard. November is in fact a \\"sleeper\\" Active. Adelle can switch November to a combat-ready personality using verbal codes. In Omega, November's original persona and memories are restored and she is released from her contract early with full payment at the request of Paul Ballard, in exchange for him joining the Dollhouse's staff; she returns to her life as Madeline Costley, in which she had a deceased daughter named Katie. November's character was originally conceived as an Active who got fewer of the criminal gigs and more of the personal ones. Whedon originally stated that the character would not be included in the show and that \\"the show simply moves too fast now for me to do what I wanted with her\\", but later hinted that the character might emerge later in the series. During the second season, Madeline was approached by Senator Daniel Perrin with evidence of her time in the Dollhouse, and being very disturbed by what she saw, she was encouraged to testify before the Senate regarding her involvement. However, since Sen. Perrin had been implanted with doll architecture and was being controlled by the Washington D.C. Dollhouse, he was made to state that the Dollhouse was an urban legend and that Madeline was delusional and would receive psychiatric care. She was then abducted and reprogrammed by the Washington D.C. Dollhouse. Later on November is rescued by Paul when he and Victor invade the D.C. Dollhouse in order to kidnap Bennet who is supposed to help them reconstruct Caroline's wedge. During her stay Adelle has her imprinted with her Mellie personality in order to avoid further complications and because she insists that unlike Madeline, Mellie trusts Paul. Although this time Mellie is aware of her doll status. When Rossum invades, Mellie flees along with the others only to invade Rossum in a bid to take the organization down. She and Paul manage to cause a lot of damage to Rossum's computer systems before Boyd plays a tape of Adelle activating Mellie's sleeper programing. Mellie proceeds to attack Paul who pleads with her to regain control, which she briefly manages. Once she realizes what a threat she poses to Paul, and that she cannot retain control of her body she commits suicide, sacrificing herself in order to save him, confessing that he made her feel like \\"a real person\\". =Alpha= Alpha (Alan Tudyk), formerly Carl William Craft, is a rogue Active who escaped the Dollhouse. Before coming to the Dollhouse, he was a prisoner convicted of kidnapping and attempted murder. When the Dollhouse was starting up, it needed \\"guinea pigs\\"; he was able to reduce his sentence by agreeing to become an Active for five years. He becomes enamored with Echo once she enters the Dollhouse, and eventually attacks Whiskey so that Echo may become the most requested Doll. An accident causes a \\"composite event\\", in which 48 personalities are simultaneously imprinted on Alpha, along with the associated memories and skill sets. In his escape, he killed several Dolls and Dollhouse staff members, including Echo's previous handler, yet he let Echo live. After his escape from the Dollhouse, Alpha begins to send anonymous packages to Paul Ballard, hinting at the existence of the Dollhouse and at Echo's former identity. Alpha reveals himself after posing as former Los Angeles Dollhouse architect Stephen Kepler, whom Ballard has tracked down. He leads Ballard into the Dollhouse, takes control of the security and automated systems, and leaves with Echo. Though Echo escapes him, he remains at large, and Ballard is sent by the Dollhouse to track him down. In the second season, Alpha returns, killing all who ever hired Echo as a serious romantic partner, save for one: Internet billionaire Joel Miner. Alpha would later leave a message via an imprinted Sierra, and this causes DeWitt to order a full rewiping of all Actives; this was predicted by Alpha, who breaks into the Dollhouse and activates a device that triggers the inset coding from the full rewipes for the Actives to attack any on sight. Capturing the client they held in Dollhouse for his own safety, he holds him hostage until Ballard gets to the chair room, where Alpha reveals his master plan; take apart Ballard's mind to discover what made Echo love him. Ultimately through the process he destroys Ballard's brain, rendering him brain dead, while forming an imprint of Ballard. Alpha imprints himself with Ballard, as Echo walks in, and they fight after Echo rejects Alpha once again. During the fight Ballard's personality surfaces and takes control and begs Echo to kill him, but she is unable to and Alpha escapes. In the future of \\"Epitaph One\\" (2019), Caroline, who has now been restored to her original self, returns to the House with Paul to take the Actives to Safe Haven. During a conversation with Dr. Saunders, she says that the imprinting technology doesn't travel, and that \\"we have Alpha to thank for that\\". One year later, during the events of Epitaph Two: Return, Alpha is revealed to be running a revived Dollhouse for \\"dumbshows\\", or those who were wiped and not given a replacement personality by Rossum. He later leaves the safety of the Dollhouse for fear that he may return to his original unstable personality and be a danger to the others, although Echo finds this unlikely, believing him to be \\"evolved\\" like herself. His fate is left unknown, but as a final act, he leaves a copy of Ballard's personality for Echo. =Other actives= Charlie is a male Active mentioned in Epitaph One who gives Priya/Sierra her 'birthmark' tattoo. Foxtrot is a female Active mentioned in Echoes who was accidentally programmed by Topher to speak Mandarin Chinese instead of Cantonese. Juliet is a female active mentioned in \\"Epitaph One\\". She is one of many actives who shelter in the LA Dollhouse building after the collapse of civilization. She entertains the others with stories of her dreams. Kilo (Maurissa Tancharoen) is a female Active brought in by Topher in the episode \\"The Public Eye\\" to demonstrate the effects of the \\"Disruptor\\". She later becomes a 'tech head' soldier, fighting under Victor's command in \\"Epitaph Two: Return\\". Mike (Teddy Sears) is an Active who first appears in Needs. He shares a room with Echo, November, Sierra, and Victor. Along with his roommates in \\"Needs\\", he was imprinted with his original personality. He expressed symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, believing he and his fellow Actives were caught in the clutches of a malign extraterrestrial experiment. Quebec (David Law) is an Active first introduced in \\"Needs\\". He is first seen returning from an engagement as an army soldier claiming to have seen a man die. Romeo is a male Active seen briefly on a screen in Topher's lab in \\"Belle Chose\\". Romeo is one of Anthony/Victor's squad in \\"Epitaph Two: Return\\", but it's not clear whether this is the same Active. Tango (Emma Bell) is an Active introduced in \\"Needs\\". She eats breakfast with Echo and Mike. She eventually is imprinted with the personality of a cabaret dancer, causing Caroline to go back into the Dollhouse in order to save the Actives from what she sees as a form of prostitution and slavery. Originally, \\"there had been an entire early subplot about an active named Tango who was an older woman\\", but this was dropped when the network decided the Actives should all be young and fit. Yankee is a female Active seen briefly on one of Topher's screens in \\"Belle Chose\\". Another, male Yankee is seen in \\"Epitaph Two: Return\\", as one of Victor's soldiers. Active call signs seem to be reused. Reference is made to other dolls designated 'November' and 'Sierra', and DeWitt suggests using Ballard as a replacement Victor now that Anthony has been returned to society. =Actives from the Washington D.C. dollhouse= Aphrodite is an Active mentioned in \\"The Left Hand\\". Apollo is a male Active seen in \\"Getting Closer\\". Cassandra is an Active mentioned in \\"Getting Closer\\". Hades is a male Active seen in \\"The Left Hand\\". LA Dollhouse StaffAdelle DeWitt= Adelle DeWitt (Olivia Williams) is the highest-ranking official at the Los Angeles Dollhouse. A British national, Adelle truly believes that what they do at the Dollhouse helps people. Prior to working in the Dollhouse, her job entailed growing human organs out of stem cells at a lab in her native England and later in Los Angeles. Although Adelle is the head of her \\"House\\", she does answer to off-screen superiors, as the L.A. Dollhouse is just one of more than twenty worldwide with their headquarters in Tucson, Arizona. She is revealed to be \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" who has hired out Victor several times for romantic encounters to quell her intense loneliness. In \\"Epitaph One\\", Adelle has become more protective of the Actives, going as far as to challenge the C.E.O. of Rossum when he informs her that the company will start selling Actives to their wealthiest clients. Another flashback shows her living in the Dollhouse, with the other Actives (who have been restored with their original personalities) and has developed a profound bond with Topher, who has gone insane with guilt over the chaos the imprinting technology caused. Adelle has a drinking problem, rarely seen without a drink in season one. In \\"Stop-Loss\\", she is found passed out at her desk. =Boyd Langton= Boyd Langton (Harry J. Lennix), is introduced as a former cop who is working as a handler at the Dollhouse first assigned as Echo's handler. He has a strong, almost fatherly attachment to Echo. After Dominic is sent to the attic, Langton becomes the new head of security, though retaining a connection to Echo. He expresses doubts about the ethics of what the Dollhouse does with the Actives and is not afraid to share his reservations with the fellow staff, including DeWitt. In a future scene in \\"Epitaph One\\" (later shown in context in \\"Getting Closer\\"), it is revealed that Boyd is in a romantic relationship with Claire Saunders, and must leave the Dollhouse in a hurry, though promises to come back for her. Langton has a relationship with Saunders that is kept hidden from the employees of the Dollhouse. It is later revealed (via flashbacks in \\"Getting Closer\\" and \\"The Hollow Men\\") that he is one of the two founders of the Rossum Corporation. He joins a resistance group of the main L.A. Dollhouse characters and they storm into the base of the Rossum Corporation. There, he reveals the truth to the other members of his party. He also reveals that Claire/Whiskey has been reprogrammed with an altered copy of Clyde, Boyd's Rossum co-founder. However, Boyd is foiled when his mind is wiped to a blank doll state just before he can kill Echo. He is then strapped with dynamite and ordered to detonate a grenade. He does so, killing himself and apparently destroying all of Rossum's work. =Topher Brink= Christopher \\"Topher\\" Brink (Fran Kranz) is the scientist who operates the Dollhouse technology and uses it to imprint new personalities on the Actives. He has stated that the technology takes imprints from existing people, which he then mixes and matches to create the desired imprint. A genius, Topher has a cocky, if quirky, attitude which puts him at odds with Ballard, who believes that Topher cannot completely wipe a person's soul from their body. In the DVD extra \\"Epitaph One\\" episode it is revealed that while he did not invent the technology, he improved the speed and viability of imprinting ‚Äî something that makes him feel responsible and eventually drives him insane after the imprinting technology becomes weaponized. On his birthday, Topher is able to use an Active to goof off with in order to celebrate under the guise of an \\"anterior insular cortex diagnostic\\" ‚Äì an indulgence Adelle allows him once a year. Topher is revealed to have become even more insane by 2019 and forced to work for Rossum. It is revealed that he was forced to create a massive device that would wipe the entire planet. He later sacrificed himself to remove the imprints from everyone and restore the world to what it was before. =Paul Ballard= Paul Ballard (Tahmoh Penikett) is the ex-FBI special agent assigned to the Dollhouse case. While most in the Bureau view the case as a joke, he takes it seriously, to the point of obsession. Throughout the show, his main objective is to rescue Caroline. In Man on the Street, a mole in the Dollhouse secretly imprints Echo with a secret personality who informs Ballard that he must be discharged from the FBI in order to throw the Dollhouse off of his trail before he truly can uncover the truth of the organization. He had become involved with his neighbor Mellie before discovering the Dollhouse imprinted her to spy on him. He then distances himself from her, using her vulnerability to follow her to the Dollhouse's location. In \\"Omega\\" he agrees to work for the Dollhouse in exchange for the freedom of Mellie, a.k.a. November (her doll designation). Ballard was wiped by Alpha in \\"A Love Supreme\\" and his body left on life support, however Topher is able to partially restore him in \\"The Attic\\" by converting him into an active and imprinting him with the scan Alpha took of him. However, due to Alpha's brutal treatment, parts of his brain have been permanently damaged, and Topher is forced to \\"rewire\\" his brain to function without them; at the cost of some other mental capacity, namely the connection he had with Echo. He was killed in the final episode when an unknown shooter shot him in the head while he was trying to help one of the survivors. His imprinted wedge was left by a redeemed Alpha and was later imprinted into Echo so they could be together. =Claire Saunders= Dr. Claire Saunders (Amy Acker) is the Actives' general physician. It is revealed in \\"Omega\\" that she was an Active, Whiskey. Formerly the Dollhouse's most popular Doll, she was attacked by Alpha with a pair of scissors, causing extensive facial scars. Shortly afterwards, with the original Dr. Saunders killed by Alpha, Whiskey was imprinted with his personality and skill-set. Topher programmed the imprint to make her disagree with him so they would not \\"miss anything\\". Saunders does not wish to be imprinted with her original self, and in \\"Vows\\", leaves the dollhouse. The role of Claire Saunders was originally conceived for a woman in her 40s or 50s, but Whedon had worked with Acker on Angel and he decided she would be the best actress for the part; therefore Whedon adapted the character, despite initial reservations about casting too many Buffy and Angel alumni. Flashbacks in \\"Epitaph One\\" show that Dr. Saunders became romantically involved with Boyd Langton - a scene later shown in \\"Getting Closer\\" - and following the technological apocalypse and Topher's breakdown, acts as the Dollhouse's programmer. In the 2019 framing narrative for \\"Epitaph One\\" however, Dr. Saunders' persona has apparently faded away, leaving Whiskey with faint traces of Saunders' personality. =Ivy= Topher's assistant (Liza Lapira). While she is highly skilled and sees herself as his apprentice, Topher treats her more as a gofer, assigning her menial tasks such as fetching him snacks. She was framed by the NSA as the mole in the Dollhouse to hide Dominic, though her innocence is quickly found by an imprinted Echo. =Sophie Alvarez= Sophie Alvarez (Angel Desai) is a handler shown in two episodes. In \\"Omega\\" she is shown to have been the handler of Whiskey and in \\"Needs\\" she is attacked by Echo, who is trying to break into a gun cabinet. =Laurence Dominic= Laurence Dominic (Reed Diamond), head of security at the Dollhouse during most of the first season, takes his job very seriously, but doesn't think very highly of the Dolls themselves, viewing them more as robots than humans. He attempts to kill Echo, and also suggests she be retired as an Active, and put into \\"the Attic\\". Later, while intoxicated, he attempts to apologize to Echo for his actions. Dominic is revealed to be an NSA agent spying on the Dollhouse and (after having his memories extracted by Topher) is sent to the Attic. Later on, in the episode \\"The Attic\\", when Echo breaks through her looping nightmare, she re-encounters Dominic, who has conquered his own nightmare and is fighting a psychic assassin known as Arcane. Being convinced to join Echo, he frees Priya and Anthony, and ultimately traps Arcane, who is in fact Clyde; a founder of Rossum. After he explains the motives behind and the purpose of the Attic, Echo, Priya and Anthony leave while Clyde and Dominic decide to stay behind to free those trapped in the attic from their eternal nightmare. However, during the next episode, Dominic frees himself from the attic, and works his way down to the corridors where Echo is allowing Anthony and Priya to leave the house, and warns her that Clyde is dead and Rossum is onto their plans. From the stress and shock that was required to break out, he collapses. The shock was significant, and he was expected not to survive unless he was placed in the attic again. Despite his objections he is prepped and assumed replaced. In \\"Epitaph One\\", Dominic is shown to have been recently released from the Attic with his memory restored, shortly after imprinting technology starts being used as a weapon. He appears slightly unstable due to what was done to him since being sent to the Attic and taunts Adelle about the technology getting out of control. He is not seen again in the later flashbacks, nor does he appear in the future events of \\"Epitaph One\\" and \\"Epitaph Two\\". His fate is unknown, presumed dead. =Joe Hearn= Joe Hearn (Kevin Kilner) is Sierra's handler in the first six episodes, and was the handler to the previous Sierra. Joe Hearn is introduced as a less dedicated counterpart to Boyd Langton, and strongly dislikes Echo for her individualism and worries about her influence on Sierra. DeWitt eventually learns that Hearn raped Sierra in her blank state a number of times, and arranges Hearn's death by assigning him to assassinate \\"Mellie\\" (actually the active November), then activating November with a trigger phrase (revealing her as a sleeper), causing her to kill him. =Dr. Saunders= Dr. Saunders (Joe Howard) used to serve as the Actives' general physician. He was killed by Alpha, which caused Whiskey to become his replacement. Other Rossum EmployeesBennett Halverson= Bennett Halverson (Summer Glau) used to serve as the scientist who worked for the Washington D.C. Dollhouse. She started working at the Rossum Corporation when she was in college rooming with Caroline, her first friend. Caroline stole both her and Bennett's folders from Rossum and Bennett found out. However, Bennett wanted to help, so the two went to the building to blow it up, but Caroline found some dolls and tried to stop the explosion. The room that Bennett was in exploded and her arm was trapped under debris and Caroline tried to help, but fled the scene. The L.A. Dollhouse kidnaps Bennett in order to get her to restore Caroline's backup wedge. While she is trying, Dr. Saunders comes in and starts talking to her about her kiss with Topher. Dr. Saunders turns out to be a sleeper, and fatally shoots Bennett in the head, spraying blood onto Topher. The result of her death had a profound impact on Topher and eventually started the chain reaction that caused his insanity. A video of Bennett lecturing on imprinting helped Topher design the mass-wipe bomb that de-programmed everyone at the end of the series. FBI StaffGraham Tanaka= Graham Tanaka (Mark Sheppard) is an FBI agent highly critical of Ballard's assignment of the Dollhouse, believing it to be nothing more than an urban legend. =Loomis= Loomis (Aisha Hinds) is an FBI analyst and Ballard's ally within the Bureau while he's suspended. She provides him with FBI file access and information even though she is not fully convinced on the Dollhouse's existence. Actuals The \\"Actuals\\" are a group of resistance members in the year 2019. Calling themselves \\"actuals\\", which means they are people who have yet to be affected by the wireless imprinting occurring across the world which started a few years prior. They seek to find a cure to the imprinting which is causing chaos and madness to most of the world's population. =Mag= Mag (Felicia Day) (short for Maggie) is the leader of a ragtag group who calls themselves the \\"actuals\\", people who still have not been imprinted and retain their original personalities. In the year 2019, she leads a small group of \\"actuals\\" underground to the remains of the Los Angeles Dollhouse where they may find a cure to the memory imprinting across the world. After learning the truth of the Dollhouse, she and the remaining members begin their trek to find safe haven. Some months later, they later find Haven thanks to Echo and Ballard and she later takes part in the assault in L.A. to enter the Dollhouse. She was shot several times in both legs during the assault and becomes a wheelchair user. Due to her injuries, she is forced to stay in the Dollhouse, leaving the care of Iris to Zone. Before the final Imprint near the end, she reveals to Zone that before the chaos imprinting, she used to attend college at Berkeley and was dating a girl who was a classmate at the university. =Zone= Zone (Zack Ward) is one of the members of Mag's group. He is much more cautious about imprinted people and will not hesitate to kill them if they threaten the group. He is also the first person to find out about Iris' duplicity and tricks her into revealing her malicious intentions. Zone, with Mag and Iris/Caroline, begin their journey to find safe haven. He was captured by what was left of Rossum and was rescued by Echo and Ballard. Despite his protest he went along as a guide to the Dollhouse members through LA and Dollhouse LA, eventually helping in returning all those Imprinted to their original selves. Due to Mag's injuries, he was left with the task of protecting Iris, becoming her \\"handler\\". Before the final Imprint, he reveals to a surprised Mag that before the chaos imprinting, he was a landscape architect living in Pasadena and was married to a woman whom he hoped to start a family with. =Iris= Iris (Adair Tishler) is a young girl who recently joined Mag's group with her imprinted father Mr. Miller. However, it is later revealed that Iris is an imprinted human and actually faked a father-daughter relationship with Miller, which wasn't his real surname. Inside the remains of the Dollhouse, Iris begins killing off the survivors with the intention to leave the girl's body and find safe haven for herself. Zone discovers her duplicity and forces her into the imprint chair to upload Caroline Farrell's personality into her. At the series end, her Caroline imprint led the survivors to Haven and she along with the other imprinted are wiped thanks to Topher's machine.

The unit rapidly transitioned into World War I where the brigade earned four battle streamers for participation in the campaigns Aisne- Marne, Oise-Aisne, Meuse-Argonne, and Champagne 1918. The unit was demobilized at Fort Lewis, Wash. 30 June 1921. The brigade was reconstituted 14 October 1936 in the regular Army as Headquarters, 31st Coast Artillery Brigade and was later designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 31st Coast Artillery Brigade. In November 1942 the brigade was activated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 31st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade as part of the coastal air defense stationed at Camp Haan, Cali. and was later deployed to the European Theater where it participated in and earned three more battle streamers for campaigns in Rome-Arno, Southern France, and the Rhineland. On 30 June 1946, the brigade was deactivated at Laned-Sebold, Germany. This unit would encounter numerous activations and inactivations over the years to come to include a 1946 inactivation in Germany, reactivation in 1948 at Fort Bliss, Tex. and in 1958 was reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 31st Artillery Brigade. The headquarters was inactivated in 1960 at McChord Air Force Base, Wash. and then reactivated on 15 December 1961 at Lockport Air Force Station, N.Y., as the 31st Artillery Brigade (Air Defense). It assumed the personnel and equipment of the inactivating 2nd Artillery Group (Air Defense).http://nikemissile.org/NFBU/NFBU52-70.pdf, page 41 of 82. At the time, the brigade appears to have supervised, among others, 1-4 Artillery (AD), and 2nd Battalion 62nd Artillery, plus 2nd Missile Battalion, 209th Artillery, NY ARNG. In response to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the brigade was set up with nine Hercules and Hawk battalions defending southern Florida from attack by Cuba and the Soviet Union. The brigade was designated under its present name on 15 March 1972, and after one final inactivation in 1979 at Homestead Air Force Base in Fla., the brigade would be reactivated again on 1 April 1988, at Fort Hood, Tex. to support III Corps. In February, 1996, the brigade once again received movement orders, this time to Fort Bliss, Tex. In June 2008, 3-2 ADA entered the Korean peninsula to conduct operations at Osan AFB, Suwon, Camp Humphries, and Camp Carrol under the temporary command of the 35th Brigade. 31st ADA underwent a BRAC-directed move from Fort Bliss, Tex. to Fort Sill, Okla. in July 2009. In June 2010, 3-2 ADA deployed again to Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE for an air defense mission to defend assets from Iran, for one year in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and returned its Soldiers home safely in July 2011. Currently, 31st has two units deployed worldwide. 4th Battalion, 3rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment is deployed to Kuwait for a year to support our allies abroad, while 3-2 ADA is deployed to Turkey, establishing two Patriot missile batteries to help defend the region from possible air and missile threats that may occur as a result of the ongoing civil war in Syria.

Headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin, it is geographically one of the largest local BSA councils. Bay-Lakes Council #635 was formed on July 1, 1973, the product of a merger between six east Wisconsin councils. The council is served by Kon Wapos Lodge #635 of the Order of the Arrow. Organization Bay-Lakes Council has a professional staff of approximately 26 people. There are over 18,400 Scouts in the council's 23 counties in Eastern Wisconsin, and 14 counties (all but Gogebic) in Michigan's upper peninsula. There are 320 Cub Scout packs, 230 Scouts BSA troops, 90 Venturing crews and 75 Explorer posts and over 4,600 adult volunteers. =Districts= Bay-Lakes Council is divided into eight districts. * Gathering Waters District covers parts of Calumet, Winnebago & Waupaca and all of Outagamie and Shawano counties. * Hiawathaland District covers Michigan's upper peninsula; formerly Hiawathaland Council. * Kettle Country District covers Ozaukee county, and parts of Dodge and Washington counties. * Lakeshore District covers Calumet, Manitowoc and Sheboygan counties. * Ledge to Lakes District covers Fond du Lac, Green Lake, and Marquette counties. * Northern Lights District covers Marinette, Oconto and Langlade Counties and part of Menominee county in Upper Michigan. * Twin Lakes District covers Waupaca, Waushara, and Winnebago counties. * Voyageur District covers Brown, Door and Kewaunee counties. =Board of Directors= The council's board of directors comprises the seven district chairpersons, the council president, council commissioner, and council treasurer. =Endowment= An endowment fund has been created for Bay-Lakes Council to help ensure the financial viability of the council into the future. History Neckerchief slide from historical Waumegesako Council Bay-Lakes Council was formed in 1973 by a merger of the following councils: Badger (based in Fond du Lac), Waumegesako (based in Manitowoc), Nicolet Area (based in Green Bay), Valley (based in Menasha), Twin Lakes (based in Oshkosh), and Kettle Moraine (based in Sheboygan). The Hiawathaland Council joined in 2012. The history of each of these parent councils is depicted below. Camps The Bay-Lakes Council offers five main summer camp programs: * Cub Scout World Camp Rokilio, a Cub Scout resident camp * Gardner Dam Scout Camp, a Webelos resident camp and offers many high- adventure activities in partnership with Bear Paw Scout Camp * Bear Paw Scout Camp, week-long summer resident camping for Scouts BSA * Camp Hiawatha for Scouts BSA, Cub Scout resident camping and high-adventure activities in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As well as one group camp without a summer program: * JAX Camp in Door County is a base for high adventure such as sea kayaking and sailing. =Bear Paw Scout Camp= Main entrance to Bear Paw Bear Paw's waterfront, viewed from Chapel Point Located on Bear Paw Lake east of Mountain, Wisconsin in the Nicolet National Forest, Bear Paw Scout Camp has year-round camping, both indoor and outdoor, but is primarily a week-long resident summer camp for Boy Scouts. In addition to rustic campsites and heated cabins for camping, Bear Paw has several permanent buildings supporting its program areas, a trading post for snacks and memorabilia, an enclosed chapel on a wooded point overlooking the water, a large and modern dining hall, a lakeside fire circle for evening council fires and ceremonies, and a nine-hole disc golf course. Hiking trails range from short, in-camp jaunts to destinations such as Explorer Point to longer treks to Oconto County features such as Lost Mountain, Staff Mountain, and Waupee Rapids. Marked cycling trails up to long criss-cross the roads in the vicinity of camp. Besides summer camp weeks, Bear Paw's sixteen campsites and four heated cabins can be rented by Scouts. Some events and programs offered throughout the year include shooting sports, Maple Syrup Days, Cooking merit badge, Paul Bunyan Woodsman Award, geocaching, orienteering, and wilderness search and rescue. The camp has a website. =Gardner Dam Scout Camp= As of 2019 Gardner Dam Scout Camp hosts the summer Webelos program which was held before at Camp Twin Lakes. Opened in 1932, Gardner Dam Scout Camp is located along the Wolf River, near the village of White Lake, in the town of Wolf River, Langlade County. Gardner Dam offers a variety of programs including many high adventure opportunities including rock climbing, bouldering, whitewater tubing, whitewater kayaking, whitewater canoeing, and ATVs. Gardner Dam also offers shooting sports ranges for shotgun, rifle, and archery, as well as a host of trails for hiking and biking. The camp inhabits both sides of the river with one side being dedicated to campsites and the other side being dedicated to the numerous program areas. When Gardner Dam first opened in 1932, it was a dining hall camp. Then in 1970, it changed to a patrol cooking camp for then-Boy Scout troops (now Scouts BSA troops) where troops would pick up their food from the commissary each meal and cook in their campsite. With the change in summer programs to Webelos, a dining hall is going to be erected on the north side of the Wolf River. There is a man-made pond fed directly from the Wolf River. The water flows freely through the pond and is held in by a dam. Because of this design, the water avoids becoming stagnant, because fresh water is constantly being fed from the river. Gardner Dam also has a climbing tower available for Climbing merit badge and climbing during free time. In 2008 a new shooting sports facility was built. The shooting sports area has a section for both rifle shooting and shotgun trap shooting. The camp is also available in spring, fall, and winter months for Scout troops and non-Scouting groups to come and camp on their own. In the non-summer months, units may stay in either the older Wisconsin Electric lodge, or the newer Wausau Homes Adventure Lodge (WHAL - pronounced Wall), both of which have indoor bathrooms including showers. The campsites and program areas are home to 13 sessions of four-day, three-night Webelos resident camp from June through August, and weekend use by all units the remainder of the year. =Camp Rokilio= This camp was founded in 1924 as a Boy Scout Camp. Original funding came from several service clubs: the Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, and later the Optimist clubs, hence the name Rokilio. Cabins were built and Rokilio became a winter destination as well. Sledding down the driveway from the cabins to the dining hall became classic. Camp Rokilio is of hilly terrain with tall timber located in the Kettle Moraine east of Kiel, Wisconsin. The camp is on Cedar Lake and has a waterfront. In the late 1990s, Cub Scout day camp moved from Twin Lakes, and Cub Scout World at Rokilio was created. The camp features six program theme buildings: Fort J.J. Keller, Gunderson Viking B√§ten, Knauf Space Station, Kohler Castle, and Oertle Train Station. The sixth, Gold Miner's Village, is no longer in use due to the Webelos program at Gardner Dam Scout Camp. The buildings are home to 13 sessions of four-day and three-night Cub Scout resident camp from June through August, and weekend use by all units the remainder of the year. Camp Rokilio offers waterfront activities in Cedar Lake, BB guns and archery ranges, and a natural bog conducive to nature hikes and environmental studies. =Camp Hiawatha= Founded in 1967, this camp consists of 800 acres around Bunting Lake in the Hiawatha National Forest south of Munising, Michigan. The camp provides eight developed campsites for Scouts BSA and Cub Scout resident camps, a number of buildings to serve the programs and activities, and a few cabins that can be rented by families. = JAX Camp = JAX Camp is a rustic weekend camp that offers basic amenities, and is located in Door County near Sturgeon Bay, in the town of Sevastopol. Former camps The following properties were originally owned by the council (or one of its predecessor councils) or operated by the council as a camp: * Camp Maywood-Wilderness, founded 1970, (over 200 acres near Wautoma) was primarily used for Wood Badge and JLT courses. In addition to some rustic campsites, it had a heated barn with kitchen and bunkhouse, a pavilion, a private lake, hiking trails, and geocaching. The camp was sold to private buyers in 2014 as a part of the Imagine 2024 initiative, and some of its assets given to the other Bay-Lakes camps. * Camp Sinawahttp://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI- idx?type=turn&id;=WI.Monograph48&entity;=WI.Monograph48.p0002&isize;=texthttp://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi- bin/WI/WI- idx?type=turn&entity;=WI.Monograph48.p0015&id;=WI.Monograph48&isize;=text is a privately run camp in Valders, WI . Sites are rented out by the public and various youth groups. * Camp Red Buck was an early Boy Scout summer camp located on Scout, Council, and Red Jacket Lakes in Michigan's Upper Peninsula near Munising. The camp was closed with the opening of Camp Hiawatha. The site is currently occupied by the Council Lake Dispersed Campsite in the Hiawatha National Forest. * Camp Twin Lakes was located on County Road K, 11 miles (18 km) south of Waupaca, WI, on 425 acres (1.72 km2) of woods and meadowland, with three lakes that were used for swimming, boating, canoeing, and fishing. It was developed into sixteen campsites ranging from improved sites for group camping to leave-no-trace sites for backpacking to family campsites for registered Scouters and family. It also had several hiking trails and three winter buildings, two housing twenty-four people and one for eighteen. Originally designed for Cub Scout Day Camp, Camp Twin Lakes was later used as the home of Twin Lakes Webelos Resident Camp. Camp Twin Lakes, which by April 2018 was being leased for use as the Webelos Summer Camp, was moved to Gardner Dam Scout Camp as part of the Imagine 2024 (later Growing Future Leaders) initiative. Order of the Arrow Bay-Lakes Council is served by the Kon Wapos Lodge of the Order of the Arrow. The Kon Wapos totem is the snow shoe hare, and the number is 635. This lodge was formed as the 2013 merger of Ag-Im and Awase lodges. Awase Lodge #61 was chartered on January 1, 1974. The name Awase, originally derived from the word owasse, which means \\"bear\\" in the Menominee Indian language, was adopted as the name for this lodge, which was created as new lodge, due to the merger of the six Northeast Wisconsin Councils. The original lodges, Shaginappi, Sinawa, Chequah, Wa Zi Ya Ta, Day Noomp, and Wolverine chose lodge #61 for the new Awase Lodge. Some arrowmen have chosen to correlate the lodge number \\"61\\" to signify \\"six lodges to one\\" (circa 2010). Ag-Im Lodge #156 was formed in 1945 from Northwoods Circle Lodge #156 (originally part of Copper Country Council), Ottawa Lodge #198 (originally part of Iron Range Council), and Minnewasco Lodge #250 (originally part of Red Buck Council). The ancestry of each of these lodges is depicted below.  Growing Future Leaders Capital Campaign  The primary mission of the Growing Future Leaders Capital Campaign (formally Imagine 2024) as stated by its website: > \\"The mission of the ‚ÄúImagine 2024‚Äù Plan is to enhance Council properties > ensuring that they support and complement a diverse year-round program > offering. This plan will focus on: Fiscal responsibility of valuable Council > resources; Utilization of the unique natural qualities of each property, as > well as surrounding program opportunities to enhance program offerings; > Provide continuous improvement to allow for growth and flexibility of the > plan as needs change; and Create sustainable camp models...\\" As of June 2016, the following changes were made: * The Dining Hall at Camp Rokilio had its roof replaced. * Camp Maywood-Wilderness was sold. * 20 acres of JAX camp were sold. As of October 2019, a new welcome center and multiple purpose building was built in Camp Rokilio.

History A group of Scot capitalists formed the Oregonian Railway Company, Limited after purchasing the bankrupt Dayton, Sheridan and Grande Ronde Railroad in 1879. The first changes made were to move the Dayton terminal, on the Yamhill River, to Fulquartz Landing on the Willamette River. On the opposite bank of the Willamette, the railroad built Ray's Landing. This became the north terminus of the narrow gauge line on the east side of the Willamette valley. The line connected towns such as St. Paul, Woodburn, Silverton, Brownsville, and Coburg. The railroad also expanded the westside line south to reach Perrydale, Dallas, Monmouth, Independence and Airlie. The stop at the end of the line was named after the Earl of Airlie, the leader of the Scot capitalists. Revenues were dropping, and by 1886 or 1887 the railroad granted a long-term lease to Henry Villard of the Oregon & California Railroad. In later years, Villard would leave the Oregon railroad scene and the line came to be under the control of Southern Pacific Railroad.

She was the eldest child and only daughter of Jaroslav of Sternberg (Jaroslav ze ≈†ternberka) by his second wife Margareta of B√≠lina (Machna z B√≠liny). Margareta had two full-brothers, Ale≈° and Jan, and also two older half-brothers, Zdenƒõk (d. aft. 1408) and Smil (d. 1398), born from the first marriage of Jaroslav of Sternberg with a certain Eli≈°ka. Life By 14 February 1347 Margareta married Duke Boles≈Çaw of Ko≈∫le. The marriage produced three daughters: Elisabeth ‚Äîby marriage Duchess of Cieszyn‚Äî, Euphemia ‚Äîby her first marriage Duchess of Niemodlin and by the second Duchess of Ziƒôbice‚Äî and Bolka ‚Äîlater Abbess of Trzebnica‚Äî. In 1352, Duke Boles≈Çaw inherited the Duchy of Bytom but died suddenly in Italy three years later (1355). In his will, he left Bytom to Margareta as her ; however, the disputes soon began over the inheritance of the Duchy of Ko≈∫le-Bytom between the Dukes of Ole≈õnica and Cieszyn, who claimed rights by virtue of the treaty signed between Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Bytom and the Bohemian Kingdom, under which the succession of women over the Duchy in absence of male heirs was allowed. Ko≈∫le was taken by Duke Konrad I of Ole≈õnica (who claimed the rights of his wife Euphemia, eldest half-sister of Boles≈Çaw). At consequence of this conflict, Margareta's rights over Bytom were disputed and her rule was only formally. After two years of conflicts, on 8 December 1357 a settlement was made: Bytom was divided between the Dukes Konrad I of Ole≈õnica and Casimir I of Cieszyn, legal guardian of Boles≈Çaw's daughters, who were forced to renounce their rights over the Duchy. Three years later, in 1360, the new Duke of Cieszyn, Przemys≈Çaw I Noszak, married Elisabeth, the eldest daughter of Boles≈Çaw, and with this acquired additional rights over the half of Bytom. Margareta died five years later.

The brigade was organized as the 111th Air Defense Artillery Brigade of the United States Army. The 200th Air Defense Artillery Regiment was reorganized on 1 September 1975 to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 49th Armored Division; the 2nd Battalion, an element of the 47th Infantry Division; the 3rd Battalion, an element of the 50th Armored Division; and the 4th Battalion, an element of the 40th Infantry Division. 1st Battalion headquarters was at Roswell, 2nd Battalion at Las Cruces, 3rd Battalion at Albuquerque, and 4th Battalion at Tucumcari. Equipped with the M42 Duster self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, the battalions served as divisional air defense artillery units of National Guard divisions but were under the administrative control of Headquarters, 111th Air Defense Artillery Brigade. The 5th Battalion was activated on 1 July 1983, the first and only Roland-equipped United States Army unit, and reached initial operating capability in December 1985. The majority of its personnel volunteered for full-time service at McGregor Range, administered by Fort Bliss. As a result, the battalion was affiliated with the active 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade and under the control of Central Command and Forces Command. During its five years of existence, the battalion made 101 Roland firings during exercises. The 111th Air Defense Artillery Brigade headquarters became the 111th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade headquarters during 2005. Similar to a special troops battalion, its mission was to support units of the Regular Army. The 111th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade headquarters deployed to Guantanamo Bay and Kosovo. On 1 September 2016, the brigade was redesignated, once again, as a sustainment brigade that focuses on providing mission command for combat support and combat service support units. The brigade is designed to operate independently in a theater of operations, in conjunction with other sustainment brigades under the command of a sustainment command (expeditionary), or directly under a theater sustainment command.111TH SUSTAINMENT BRIGADE - Shoulder Sleeve Insignia , The Institute of Heraldry, dated 1 September 2016, last accessed 20 May 2017 Following the sustainment brigade conversion, the 111th included the 111th Special Troops Battalion, 515th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, and 615th Transportation Battalion.

Woodstext 2 Cai. R. 482 Cai. R. 48 is an abbreviation for volume 2 of Caines' Reports, page 48, which was in turn named for George Caines, who reported New York cases in the early 19th century. (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804) was an 1804 American case which contributed to precedent around the doctrine of caveat emptor. Summary The following summary comes from an open source published in 1884: ::In Seixas v. Woods (1804), a contract was made for the delivery of \\"braziletto wood,\\" and it was so advertised and described in the invoice. A delivery was made of an article known as \\"peachum wood,\\" much inferior in quality. There was no evidence of fraud or an express warranty, and it was held that an action on the case would not lie, \\"for selling one wood for the other.\\" Kent, Chancellor, said : \\"If upon a sale there be neither warranty nor deceit, the purchaser purchases at his peril. . . . The mentioning the wood as braziletto wood in the bill of parcels, and in the advertisement some days previous to the sale, did not amount to a warranty to the plaintiffs. To make an affirmation at the time of the sale a warranty, it must appear by the evidence to be so intended, and not to have been a mere matter of judgment or opinion, and of which the defendant had no particular knowledge. Here it is admitted the defendant was equally ignorant with the plaintiffs, and could have had no such intention.\\"summary Significance Seixas v. Wood relies heavily on the English case of Chandelor v Lopus, and is the American counterpart to Chandelor in developing the rule \\"caveat emptor.\\" Laidlaw v. Organ, an 1817 decision by Chief Justice John Marshall, is believed to have been the first U.S. Supreme Court case which laid down the rule of caveat emptor.Professor Eben Moglen ReferencesExternal links *Commentaries on American Law by James Kent and George Franklin Comstock Category:New York Supreme Court cases Category:United States contract case law Category:1804 in United States case law Category:1804 in New York (state) Category:Law articles needing an infobox ","title":"Seixas v.

Electors  Technically the voters of Alaska cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Alaska is allocated 3 electors because it has 1 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 18, 2000 to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state.

The film was produced by P.H. Yu, Han Sanping, Rachel Liu and John Shum. Production on the film began in March 2009 with shooting on location in China's Hebei province and in Hengdian World Studios in Zhejiang. The film was scheduled to screen later in 2009 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as well as the 2,560th birthday of Confucius himself. However, the release date was later moved to January 2010. Funimation released it on 27 March 2012 in English Dub on DVD and Blu-ray. Plot The film begins with Confucius as an old man, thinking back. Then we see him in his early 50s, being promoted from Mayor to Minister for Law in his home state of Lu. He is confronted with ethical issues after saving a slave- boy who was due to be buried alive with his former master who has just died. There are a lot of complex politics and war, ending with Confucius being rejected and becoming a wandering scholar. After many hardships and losses, he is invited back as an old man. We see him finally preparing the Spring and Autumn Annals, expecting that this book will determine his future influence.

Her \\"soothing and ethereal voice\\" was considered appropriate for the lofty spirit of the song, \\"Solitary Orchid\\" (), which is based on an ancient work by Han Yu. Wong, a Buddhist, stated that she recorded the song \\"for Confucius\\" as his writings still provide the answers to modern questions. ControversiesChoice of actors= After the project was announced, the reaction in China was decidedly mixed. As the film is made in Mandarin, many expressed concern that Chow, a native of Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong, would lack the requisite Mandarin-speaking skills to portray the revered philosopher. Others were concerned that Chow, a veteran of action and Kung Fu-cinema, would turn Confucius into a \\"kung-fu hero.\\" Such concerns were only exacerbated after mainland star Pu Cunxin criticized Hu Mei's script as containing inappropriate levels of action and romance for a film based on Confucius' life. In his review of the movie, Perry Lam of Muse has criticized Chow for being 'the least likely actor to play the title role.' =Kong Jian lawsuit= In December 2009, more controversy arose when a claimed-direct descendant of Confucius brought suit against the film-makers. After seeing the film's trailer, the descendant, Kong Jian, sought to have several scenes deleted from the release of the film and objecting to the intimations that Confucius was romantically attracted to the concubine, Nanzi. =Screening= During the film's launch in China, the Hollywood blockbuster Avatar was reportedly going to be pulled from nearly 1,600 2-D screens across China, to benefit the wide release of this film. Instead, Avatar showings continued in the fewer, but more popular 900 3-D screens throughout China, which generated over 64% of the film's total ticket sales in China. The Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily speculated that the Chinese authorities were worried Avatar had seized the market share from domestic films and noted that many of the vacant cinema slots would be replaced by Confucius,Avatar banned by Chinese sensors because plot 'could cause civil unrest', Irish Independent, accessed 01/19/2010 and the film would be \\"drawing unwanted attention to the sensitive issue\\" concerning forced evictions of Chinese homes. However, China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television responded by stating it was a \\"commercial decision\\", and because the \\"box office performance of the 2D version has not been great.\\" However, due to low attendance for Confucius, and high demand for Avatar, the Chinese government reversed their decision, and allowed Avatar to remain on some 2-D screens in China. This choice appeared to be at least partly based on the financial performance of the two films, with Avatar grossing nearly 2.5 times more money per day.

Various officials of the Catholic Church have attempted to discern the validity of these Marian apparitions in order to provide guidance to potential devotees and pilgrims. On 7 Decenter 2017, it was reported that Archbishop Hoser, Pope Francis' envoy to Medjugorje, announced that official pilgrimages are allowed, stating, \\"dioceses and other institutions can organize official pilgrimages. It‚Äôs no longer a problem.‚Äù\\"Colina, Jesus. \\"Official pilgrimages to Medjugorje are being authorized, confirms Pope Francis‚Äô envoy\\", Aleteia, December 2017 This pilgrimage was officially authorized by the Holy See in May 2019.https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2019-05/pope-authorizes- pilgrimages-to-medjugorje.html The approval was made official with the celebration of a youth festival among pilgrims and Catholic clergy in Medjugorie in for five days in August 2019.https://cruxnow.com/church-in- europe/2019/08/06/vatican-confirms-medjugorje-approval-by-joining-youth- festival/ Background When Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of Austria- Hungary, Pope Leo XIII took steps to establish dioceses (1881) and appoint local bishops. This included transferring parishes administered until then by the Franciscans to diocesan clergy. The friars resisted, and in the 1940s Franciscan provinces still controlled 63 of 79 parishes in the dioceses of Vrhbosna and Mostar. In the 1970s, friars in Herzegovina formed an association of priests to encourage popular opposition to diocesan parish takeovers. A 1975 decree by Pope Paul VI, Romanis Pontificibus, ordered that Franciscans to withdraw from most of the parishes in the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno, retaining 30 and leaving 52 to the diocesan clergy. In the 1980s the Franciscans still held 40 parishes under the direction of 80 friars.Vjekoslav Perica (2004). \\"The Apparitions in Herzegovina and the Yugoslav Crisis of the 1980s\\", Balkan Idols: Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States. Oxford University Press. pp. 117‚Äì118 On 24 June 1981, six children in the town of Medjugorje, Bosnia- Herzegovina (then part of Yugoslavia), said they had seen an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary and that these apparitions were continuing. The village began to attract pilgrims. Local Ordinary On 11 January 1982, Pavao ≈Ωaniƒá, Bishop of Mostar, within whose jurisdiction Medjugorje lay, established a commission to look into the matter.Donovan, Colin. \\"Medjugorje\\", 6 November 2013 When three days later, on 14 January 1982, three of the seers advised him that the \\"Madonna\\" supported the Franciscans, Bishop Zanic began to be concerned that they were being guided more by their Franciscan advisors than by the Blessed Virgin.Peric, Ratko. \\"Meƒëugorje: Secrets, messages, vocations, prayers, confessions, commissions\\", Diocese of Mostar-Duvno, 1 September 2007 In 1984 Bishop ≈Ωaniƒá decided to extend a first Commission to study the apparitions and expanded its membership to fifteen: 12 priests and 3 medical experts. They held seven meetings in all. This second commission completed its work in May 1986. Eleven members determined that the events at Medjugorje were Non constat de supernaturalitate (i.e., apparitions are neither approved nor condemned, but further study is needed to determine whether a supernatural character is present). The bishop duly informed the Bishops‚Äô Conference and the Holy See. Yugoslav Bishops Conference With the possible breakup of Yugoslavia, many Croat church leaders saw the new Marian cult in Herzegovina as both an aid to anti-communist efforts and a potential focus for Croat nationalism in both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. As the Medjugorje events had exceeded the scope of a local event, in January 1987, upon the suggestion of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Kuhariƒá and Bishop ≈Ωaniƒá made a joint communiqu√© in which they announced the formation of a third Commission under the direction of the Bishops Conference. The bishops would both review the work of the previous commissions and conduct its own inquiry. The Conference instructed that pilgrimages should not be organized to Medjugorje on the supposition of its being supernatural. In July Bishop ≈Ωaniƒá forbade any priests who organized pilgrimages or came there ascribing a supernatural character to the events, to celebrate Mass in his diocese, and this until the Commission of the Bishops‚Äô Conference completed its inquiry. The Bishops' Conference of Yugoslavia, at their spring meeting in Zadar on April 10, 1991, issued declaration stating in unequivocal ecclesiastical ruling that: \\"(o)n the basis of studies it cannot be affirmed that supernatural apparitions and revelations are occurring.\\" Holy See In response to an inquiry from a French bishop, in March 1996 then Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Cardinal Ratzinger, stated that official pilgrimages to Medjugorje, if presumed as a place of authentic Marian apparitions, are not permitted to be organized either on the parish or on the diocesan level. The following June, in response to reporters' questions, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, spokesman for Holy See Press Office, clarified that Archbishop Bertone was referring specifically to official pilgrimages. Catholic parishes and dioceses may not organize pilgrimages to Medjugorje, as that might give the impression of a canonical endorsement. In 1993 Bishop ≈Ωaniƒá retired at the age of 75 and was succeeded by his coadjutor, Bishop Ratko Periƒá. On 2 October 1997, Periƒá wrote: that he was convinced that the events alleged at Medjugorje were no longer non constat de supernaturalitate (that their supernatural nature is not established) but constat de non supernaturalitate (it is not of a supernatural nature).Periƒá, Ratko. \\"Letter to Thierry Boutet\\", 2 October 1997 In May 1998, in response to an inquiry from Bishop Gilbert Aubry, Bishop of Saint-Denis on Reunion Island, Archbishop Bertone cited the previous 1991 finding of non constat de supernaturalitate by the Yugoslav Bishops Conference, and noted that since the division of Yugoslavia, jurisdiction now lay with the Episcopal Conference of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bishop Periƒá's statement must be considered the expression of the personal view of the Bishop of Mostar, who, as Ordinary of the place, always has the right to express what is, and remains, his personal opinion.Bertone, Tarcisio \\"Letter to Bishop Gilbert Aubry\\", 26 May 1998, Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith In 2009 Father Tomislav Vlasic, the former \\"spiritual director\\" to the six visionaries was laicised at his own request by Pope Benedict XVI a year after he was placed under investigation over allegations that he exaggerated the apparitions and had engaged in sexual relations with a nun. Vlasic was under formal investigation for alleged \\"dubious doctrine, the manipulation of consciences, suspect mysticism and disobedience towards legitimately issued orders\\".Caldwell, Simon. \\"Pope Benedict XVI unfrocks Medjugorje priest\\", The Telegraph, 27 July 2009 On 17 March 2010, the Holy See announced that, at the request of the bishops of Bosnia Herzegovina, it had established a commission, headed by Cardinal Camillo Ruini, to examine the Medjugorje phenomenon. On 21 October 2013, the Apostolic Nunciature to the United States communicated, on behalf of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, that, in the light of the 1991 Zadar declaration about the Medjugorje events, Catholics, whether clergy or laypeople, \\"are not permitted to participate in meetings, conferences or public celebrations during which the credibility of such 'apparitions' would be taken for granted\\".\\"Vatican Advises U.S. Bishops About Medjugorje Apparitions\\", National Catholic Register/ Catholic News Agency, 6 November 2013 The letter was sent to every diocese in the U.S. as Archbishop M√ºller of the CDF wanted the U.S. bishops to be aware that Ivan Dragicevic, one of the \\"so-called visionaries\\" of Medjugorje, was scheduled to give presentations at parishes across the country and was anticipated to have more apparitions during these talks. Because the commission established in 2010 was still in the process of its investigation, the CDF determined that the judgment of the Yugoslavian bishops which precluded such gatherings remain in force. On 18 January 2014, the Holy See commission set up in 2010 to study the Medjugorje question was reported to have completed its work, the results of which it would communicate to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\\"Commission to submit study on Medjugorje\\", News.Va, 18 January 2014 On 6 June 2015, Pope Francis, referring to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, told reporters \\"we‚Äôve reached the point of making a decision and then they will say.\\"Glatz, Carol. \\"Vatican Ready to Announce Decision Guidelines on Medjugorje Pope Says\\", Catholic News Service, 6 June 2015 On 11 February 2017, Pope Francis named Bishop Henryk Hoser of Warszawa-Praga in Poland as his special envoy to Medjugorje, not to investigate the veracity of the apparitions but to evaluate the pastoral situation in Medjugorje and assess how the needs of pilgrims should best be met. Archbishop Hoser said ‚ÄúIf Marian devotion has flourished in Medjugorje, if such multitudes arrive there, it is therefore a place where veneration will continue, since Our Lady can be venerated everywhere,...‚Äù Sawicki, Konrad. \\"Archbishop Henryk Hoser to Aleteia: We should not be worried about Medjugorje!\\", Aleteia, 15 March 2017 Prior to Hoser's review, pilgrimages to Medjugorje organized by official Church groups were discouraged, although people could make them privately or through pilgrimage tour groups. Having completed his assessment, Hoser announced that the previous impediment had been lifted. ‚ÄúThe decree of the former episcopal conference of what used to be Yugoslavia, which, before the Balkan war, advised against pilgrimages in Medjugorje organized by bishops, is no longer relevant. The Archbishop spoke favorably of the staff at the site. ‚ÄúI am full of admiration for the work the Franciscans are doing there,‚Äù the Polish archbishop reported. ‚ÄúWith a relatively small team‚Äîthere is only a dozen of them‚Äîthey do a huge job of welcoming pilgrims....Today, dioceses and other institutions can organize official pilgrimages. It‚Äôs no longer a problem,‚Äù explained Archbishop Hoser. Francis Cardinal Arinze observed that Mary has not appeared at every shrine dedicated to her, citing as an example the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil. ‚ÄúSo it is a shrine, and whether she appeared there or not is a secondary question,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have to appear there to give grace.‚ÄùPentin, Edward. \\"Faithful Await Vatican Verdict on Medjugorje\\", National Catholic Register, March 14, 2017 Official position of the Church Until such time as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith releases its findings, the 1991 determination of the Yugoslav Bishops Conference of non constat de supernaturalitate (\\"It is undetermined at this time if it is of supernatural origin\\") still stands, and the Holy See considers this judgement still operative.Vigan√≤, Carlo Maria. \\"Letter from the Apostolic Nuncio to the USCCB\\", 21 October 2013 Traditionally, there have been one of three determinations with regard to apparitions: *1. Constat de supernaturalitate (Determined to be supernatural) (approved) *2. Non constat de supernaturalitate (Not determined to be supernatural) (Neither approved or condemned - not determined - neutral) *3. Constat de non supernaturalitate (Determined not to be supernatural) (condemned) Until such time as the Holy See commission's findings are revealed and approved by the pope, the \\"not determined\\" ruling remains in effect. A commission on Medjugorje established in 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI and chaired by Cardinal Camillo Ruini voted 13-1 to confirm the supernatural origin of the first seven occurrences of the apparition only. In addition, Commission members also voted to recommend lifting the Holy See ban on official diocesan and parish pilgrimages to Medjugorje and for turning the town‚Äôs parish Church of St. James into a pontifical shrine under Holy See oversight. The move, the commission indicated, would not signify recognition of the apparitions, but would acknowledge the faith and pastoral needs of the pilgrims while ensuring a proper accounting of donations. However, Pope Francis also mentioned that The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, which reviewed the Ruini report and other material to which it was privy, expressed doubts about both the phenomenon and the Ruini report. The final decision will be made by the Pope after Polish Archbishop Henryk Hoser has completed his examination of the pastoral situation in Medjugorje.Tornielli, Andrea. \\"Medjugorje; the findings of the Ruini report\\", La Stampa, 17 May 2017 =Authorization of Pilgrimage Made Official= On May 12, 2019, the Holy See officially authorized pilgrimage to Medjugorje.https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2019-05/pope- authorizes-pilgrimages-to-medjugorje.html The first Holy See sanctioned pilgrimage then took place for five days from August 2-6 2019. During the pilgrimage, approximately 60,000 young Catholics from 97 different countries took part in the celebration of a youth festival. Fourteen archbishops and bishops and about 700 Catholic priests joined the festivities as well.

He appeared in numerous TV documentaries and television debates, and was often the subject of magazine and news articles concerning ghosts and paranormal investigations. Biography Cornell was a leading British expert in parapsychology.James Houran. (2004). From Shaman to Scientist: Essays on Humanity's Search for Spirits. Scarecrow Press. p. 166. With his fellow researchers he attempted to record and measure paranormal events using equipment specifically made for the purpose, incorporating off- the-shelf computing and audio/visual capture devices long before the digital era. Cornell and his associates at the Society for Psychical Research pioneered the study of paranormal activities in the UK and paved the way for subsequent investigations. Tony Cornell was born in Histon, Cambridgeshire in 1924 and educated at The Perse School and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, then called Fitzwilliam House, from which he graduated in 1949. Tony joined the SPR in 1952, was elected to Council in 1962 and became Vice-President in 1992. Elected Treasurer in 1980, he resigned in 2003, having held the post for 22 years. During this time he focused mainly on investigating hauntings, poltergeists and mediums. With Alan Gauld and Howard Wilkinson he created SPIDER (Spontaneous Psychological Incident Recorder). Many cases were monitored, photographically and electronically, but little significant evidence was obtained in twenty years of its use. In 1971, he visited Russian parapsychologists in Leningrad and Moscow to discuss their telepathy experiments. Mainly interested in apparitions, poltergeists and mediums, Cornell acquired a reputation for trying to get to the bottom of what was going on in a measured and unemotional way, a far cry from the current sensationalistic approach apparent in current media offerings which seem more geared towards entertainment than fact finding. Cornell was a member of CUSPR (Cambridge University Society for Psychical Research) and was appointed Research Officer in 1958 and President in 1968. As the SPR Treasurer and ongoing CUSPR President, he served on the organising committee for the SPR Centenary Conference, held at Trinity College in 1982. Cornell was the author of numerous papers on ghosts and poltergeists and expressed some cautious opinions on the Scole, SORRAT Min-lab (USA) and Enfield cases. He co-authored Poltergeists with Alan Gauld (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1979) and his last major work was Investigating the Paranormal (Helix Press, New York, 2002). By far his most pressing concern was the continued lack of any new knowledge gained about their cause in recent investigations, which have been conducted in an almost identical way for the last 125 years. Cornell was also an amateur antiquarian and helped ensure the preservation of a number of old, timber-framed buildings opposite the Round Church in central Cambridge. Despite the focus of his career, Cornell's most enduring legacy may well be the Cambridge Science Park, which he proposed in the late sixties. Cornell retired from active paranormal investigations after suffering a stroke in 2004. He died peacefully at home in the company of Martin, his second son and Alison, his third wife, on Saturday 10 April 2010. A memorial service was held in the chapel of Fitzwilliam College on 20 June and his ashes scattered in Histon pond during the late evening of 22 June 2010. Research Cornell spent over 50 years investigating the paranormal and came to the conclusion that most paranormal cases turn out to have natural explanations such as the result of fraud, pranks and misidentification. He believed that many sightings of ghosts, hauntings and poltergeists are products of the human mind.Rosemary Ellen Guiley. (2008). Ghosts and Haunted Places. Checkmark Books. p. 43. Cornell estimated that of the 800 cases that he investigated, only twenty percent were difficult to explain and only a handful were paranormal.John Zupansic. (2003). Book review. Investigating the Paranormal. Ghostvillage. Cornell wrote that there is no evidence for the spiritualist hypothesis and most s√©ance room phenomena can be explained by unconscious and deliberate fraud. He wrote that discarnate spirits in trance mediumship are secondary personalities from the mediums subconscious and that all physical mediumship such as ectoplasm is the result of fraud and trickery, however, he believed psychokinesis and telepathy to be real. According to Cornell \\"without the presence of a living person, none of the alleged paranormal effects occur.\\" Throughout his career as a parapsychologist Cornell exposed a number of fraudulent mediums including Rita Goold and Alec Harris.Tony Cornell. (2002). Investigating the Paranormal. Helix Press New York. pp. 400-414. The psychologist and skeptic Richard Wiseman has noted that Cornell conducted a \\"great deal of fascinating work\\". He investigated the reliability of eyewitness testimony for ghosts by dressing up as a fake spirit in several locations in Cambridge. Cornell discovered that the eyewitness reports were often far from accurate and unreliable.Richard Wiseman. (2011). Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There. Macmillan. pp. 167-168. However, Cornell was not just another debunker, but understood and often remarked that ghosts and paranormal activity had been recorded throughout human history and so there was clearly something else going on that we did not understand and which known science could not explain, thus requiring careful, level-headed and dispassionate investigation.

The boats had been paid for by the Israeli government but had not been delivered due to the French arms embargo in 1969. The whole operation was planned by the Israeli Navy, and was codenamed Operation Noa, after the daughter of Captain Binyamin \\"Bini\\" Telem. Background The Israeli naval command had reached the conclusion by the early 1960s that their old Second World War-era destroyers, frigates and corvettes were obsolete and new ships and vessels were needed. A survey was undertaken and the German shipyard of L√ºrssen was recommended. The shipyard was asked to design a new generation of small missile boat platforms and to modify the suggested wooden Jaguar-class torpedo boats according to Israeli Navy requirements. Due to Arab League pressure on the German government, this plan was not continued and a new builder was sought. The Israeli Navy survey recommended that the Cherbourg-based CMN shipyard owned by F√©lix Amiot would build the boats, based upon the Israeli requirements. The boats were constructed by the French and the MTU engines were German-designed. The project received the codename \\"Autumn\\". Crews were sent to France in early 1965. The technical team was headed by Commander Haim Schachal. The administrative and operational side was headed by then-Captain Binyamin (Bini) Telem, who later became the Israeli Navy's commander in chief during the Yom Kippur war. This was during the \\"Golden Age\\" of relations between Israel and France. After the Six-Day War, relations began to worsen. In 1968, Israeli paratroopers commanded by then-Colonel Raphael Eitan (who later became IDF chief of staff), carried out a raid on Beirut airport during operations against the Palestine Liberation Organization. As a result, President Charles de Gaulle ordered a full arms embargo on Israel. The problem of the Cherbourg boats was left aside. President de Gaulle was irritated by what he considered an Israeli lack of respect for Franco-Israeli agreements and he was eager to reinforce France's relations with the Arab world. The resignation of de Gaulle and the election of Georges Pompidou to be the president of France inspired hope among the Israelis. The Israeli government assumed that Pompidou would lift the embargo, but were proved wrong. While the embargo was ordered, construction of the boats continued according to the original plan; and while the Israeli naval mission was in Cherbourg, controlling the project, Israeli crews were aboard the completed boats and the whole project was fully paid for by Israel. The build-up of the Egyptian Navy with Soviet assistance during the 1960s and their procurement of new missile boats such as the Osa and Komar classes had, by the early days of the War of Attrition, changed the balance of power in the Mediterranean theatre in favour of Arab navies and away from the Israeli Navy. There was by now an urgent need for a new generation of vessels for the Israeli Navy. Israel had been developing seaborne surface-to-surface missiles, but the new vessels they would be launched from were now being built at Cherbourg. Their delivery to the Navy was considered a high priority by the Israeli Navy. The loss of the destroyer INS Eilat during an attack by Komar-class missile boats in October 1967 and the accidental loss of the submarine INS Dakar in 1968, as well as the general ageing of the Israeli fleet, brought naval planners to the conclusion that the boats had to be taken from France by deception. The operationPreparations= The plan to take the boats was formulated by retired Rear Admiral Mordechai \\"Mokka\\" Limon, formerly the Israeli Navy's commander in chief, who was the head of the Israel Defense Forces mission in Paris. Limon's affiliation with the Rothschild family provided him with important connections in France with the French government, and more widely in Europe as well. During that period, several events worked in favor of the Israelis. In 1967, the seventh boat of the twelve boats ordered, INS Mivtach (Reliance), was completed and launched. A telecom from Israeli Navy command informed the Israelis in Cherbourg that the embargo was expected to escalate, and the boats would have to sail immediately to Haifa during sea trials, ignoring the French protocols for leaving port. This angered the French, and they ordered the Israeli Navy and the other boats to leave the French harbour, and dock instead at the commercial port, which was unguarded. The boats were transferred to a front company called Starboat, registered in Panama, allegedly a Norwegian oil drill company. The front company was Limon's idea, aided by his connections with Mila Brenner, a retired naval officer with a rank of commander and the owner of the Israel-based Maritime Fruit Carriers, a company that operated cargo ships transporting fruit. Milla Brenner knew the Norwegian businessman Martin Siem, who was able to provide assistance. The front company people were Mossad members led by Benyamin Vered, one of the highest ranking commanders of Mossad. The front company feigned interest in the boats as potential survey ships for searching for oil, and declared that the boats' specifications met their needs. To add to the deception Limon pretended to have \\"tough negotiations\\" with Starboat. The terms agreed were that the boats would be transferred to Starboat and would be crewed by members of the Israeli Navy due to their experience with the boats. The boats were sold and transferred legally by the government of Israel to the front company with the approval of Michel Debr√©, the French Defense Minister. This was the first part of the deception. The next stage of the operation was to build a day-to-day routine with the aim of ultimately misleading the French at Cherbourg. Israeli skeleton crews took over the boats and maintained a routine of short voyages, heading north into the Atlantic. The skeleton crews were secretly reinforced by 80 Israeli officers, ratings and sailors in civilian clothes who arrived in groups of two at different destinations throughout Europe as tourists, and then travelled to Cherbourg. It was feared that sending them all to Cherbourg at once would alert French intelligence. They were ordered to keep moving between hotels, and not to stay in any one hotel for more than one night. The crews traveled on Israeli passports so that in the event they were caught, they could not be charged with passport fraud. By 23 December, all crews had arrived, and were scattered around the city. Mossad director-general Meir Amit considered the risk to the operation to be very high, recalling \\"it just needed one suspicious French policeman to ask why so many Jews were coming to Cherbourg for Christmas and the whole operation could be blown.‚Äù Prior to the escape, the boats had to be fuelled with large amount of diesel and stocked with enough food to sustain an eight-day voyage. Stocking and fueling this amount all at once could have alerted observers to the fact that a long voyage was planned. Commander Rinat, the head of operations, instead ordered the boats to be gradually fuelled using a small 5-ton tank truck. A quarter of a million litres of fuel was smuggled in drums and hidden belowdecks. By 24 December, the boats had been fully fuelled and stored. The supply officer bought fresh and dry food from local grocery stores to stock on the boats. To prevent arousing suspicion, the supplies were purchased in small quantities each time. Since sudden engine noise during the night of the escape would alert the French, the operation's commander, Captain Hadar Kimhi, ordered the boats' engines to be regularly started at nights, causing the inhabitants of Cherbourg to become accustomed to the noise. The local police visited the boats in response to inhabitants' complaints, and received the explanations that the electrical supply from the shore was not enough to warm the boats during the cold days of December. The boats received an authorization from the electrical company and police to operate their engines at night. The noise was loud with twenty Maybach main engines running. Manifold filter distributing five outlets to fuel five missile boats, installed in MV Lea Fueling system of MV Lea Meanwhile, the ZIM navigation company Europe Lines were approached to help in providing fuel, once the boats had left Cherbourg. Assistance was provided by Edmond Wilhelm Brillant, a retired navy officer and a naval architect. He designated MV Lea to provide fuel at Gibraltar and MV Nahariya as a backup in the Bay of Biscay (both general cargo ships that were available at that time). The main difficulty at this stage of the plan was the conversion of MV Lea into a fuelling ship carrying 200,000 litres of light diesel fuel. This was solved by conversion of the ballast tank in the ship's bow and bottom into a fuel tank. The pump system was converted to operate as both a fire fighting and fueling pump. Special high pressure hoses were used and a fueling drill was developed prior sailing to the rendezvous point near Gibraltar. According to international maritime regulations, MV Lea could not sail since safety regulations banned ships from carrying fuel in the bow as fuel vapour may cause an explosion. This issue was solved by Brillant with the aid of Kirstine shipyards and a Lloyd's Register surveyor. Additionally, a special filter was needed to make sure no dirt from tanks would contaminate the boat's tanks and engines. This filter was improvised by Brillant. It was capable of fuelling five boats, but only two at a time were fueled at the ship's stern. The overall conversion and drill took twelve hours. Other Zim divisions provided the Dan, a Ro-Ro ship sister of MV Nili which would provide fuel near Lampedusa. The captain of MV Dan was Yosef Dror, a retired Navy commander and Shayetet 13 commando frogman. In this case, tanker trailers were loaded in the ship's garage. These Zim ships sailed with additional crew made up of members of the Israeli Navy. =Escape= The boats were to escape on Christmas Eve. On the eve of the escape, the skeleton crews continued to maintain the boats, while the 80 crews who came to reinforce them hid belowdecks. The Israelis feared that the boats could sink while sailing through the Bay of Biscay in severe winter conditions. The group had a meteorologist assigned to them, who monitored all British, French and Spanish weather forecasts. Despite a forecast predicting rain from the south-west, the crews were ordered to sail out at 20:30. By 19:30, all crews were aboard. There was a force 9 storm on the night of the escape, and after the weather worsened, the departure time was extended to 22:30, but the escape was again delayed by worsening weather. Captain Hadar Kimhi received urgent coded messages from Israel ordering him to set sail despite the weather, but he decided to wait. At midnight, the meteorologist picked up a BBC report indicating that the storm would die down in two hours. At 02:30, the boats left Cherbourg and headed slowly out to sea. The French were initially unaware that the Israeli boats had left port, and their absence was noticed by a reporter who visited the port and saw that all the boats were missing. He immediately reported it to the BBC almost 12 hours after the escape, and so the French authorities learned of the boats' disappearance from the BBC. The empty berths and an absence of any announcement of the embargo's termination caused speculation that Israel had taken the boats. A television news team flew out over the North Sea to see if the boats were heading towards Norway, to where they had ostensibly been sold, while other news crews headed out over the Mediterranean. The boats crossed the Bay of Biscay before turning south and crossing into the Mediterranean, meeting Israeli support ships along the way. During fuelling by MV Lea at Gibraltar, one of the Israeli navy crew members mistakenly allowed water into the fuel tanks of INS Hetz (Arrow). It was not initially known whether the water was seawater; if it was, it could not be drained and may damage the engines. Commander Rinat asked the crew to taste the fuel and to indicate if it was salty or not. Having determined that it was not seawater, the tanks were drained. As the boats passed Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, the British monitoring station flashed a signal, asking the boats to identify themselves. The boats gave no reply, and a Lloyd's helicopter circling over them detected no flags or identity numbers. The British personnel, who had heard the media reports of the disappearance of the Israeli boats from Cherbourg, correctly guessed the boat's nationalities and true destination, then flashed the signal \\"bon voyage\\". The Israelis took it as a signal that the British understood who they were. The boats were finally spotted by television crews in the Mediterranean as they travelled fast towards Israel, hugging the coast of North Africa. Near Crete, Israeli Air Force F-4 Phantom fighters met up with the boats and flew low overhead in escort. French Defence Minister Michel Debr√© ordered an air strike to sink the boats. The French Chief of Staff refused to obey and replied he would resign rather than obey the order. The order was countermanded by Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who prevented any further escalation. Although the French government was furious, it realized that there was little that could be done, since the boats were already on the high seas when the ruse was uncovered. French Foreign Minister Maurice Schumann warned that if the boats appeared in Israel, \\"the consequences will be very grave indeed\\". MV Netanya, one of the ships assigned to support the boats The Israeli boats sailed a total of , beginning in the English Channel, and arriving at the Kishon Shipyard port in Haifa bay on 31 December. The boats were met with public jubilation when they arrived in Israel. The Navy's commander in chief during the operation was Rear-Admiral Avraham Botzer (Cheetah). The commanding officer of the operation was Captain Hadar Kimhi (later Commodore commander of Haifa Navy-Base and Naval Attach√© in Britain during the 1973 Yom Kippur War), with Commander Ezra Kedm Krishinski, nicknamed Karish (Shark) as his deputy (later on Commodore and commander of the Red Sea theatre). The boats were: *INS Sufa (Storm), skipper Lt. Ronna Arie *INS Ga'ash (Volcano), skipper Lt. Gil Koren *INS Herev (Sword), skipper Lt. Commander Gadi Ben Zeev *INS Hanit (Spear), skipper Lt. Commander Haim Shaked *INS Hetz (Arrow), skipper Commander Moshe Tabak Two young officers in the operation, Tal and Michael ‚Äî Ram, went on to become commanders in chief of the navy. The boats' names while being operated by the oil drilling company were Starboat 1,2,3,4 and 5. The boats joined the already acquired INS Sa'ar to form the Sa'ar 3-class missile boats. =International repercussions= The French government expelled Mordechai Limon from France. It was said that the French president stated \\"I do not like tea with Lemon and Mokka coffee\\". Generals Louis Bonte and Bernard Cazelles were suspended by the government. Instead Israel turned to American supplies of weapons and support. The Israeli Air Force began to be equipped by American aircraft, while the United States Navy started to train the Israeli Navy's high command and increased the level of naval cooperation. According to British intelligence writer Gordon Thomas, following the affair, Mossad agents were watched \\"as closely as any terrorist\\" when they were deployed to France to track down and kill Middle Eastern terrorists. Many times, terrorists would escape after being tipped off by a pro-Arab French intelligence officer. Missile boat flotilla The boats taken from Cherbourg were still unarmed platforms on their arrival in Israel. They were brought into the navy and armed with Gabriel missiles and ECM and EW systems produced by MABAT and RAFAEL.http://www.rafael.co.il/marketing/Templates/Homepage/Homepage.aspx?FolderID=203 Their commissioning into the Israeli Navy was overseen by Commodore Yehoshua Lahav Schneidemesser, a Haganah member who had volunteered with the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and who was at the time the division head of Navy ‚Äì Equipment and Platforms. The flotilla's working up was overseen by Captain Hadar Kimhi, who was later promoted to Commodore commanding the Naval base of Haifa. New concepts of sea missile warfare was developed by the navy and new ECM/EW techniques were developed with the leadership of Captain Herut Zemach who was awarded the Israel Defense Prize for his efforts, creating a new generation of missile boats. Later, new Israeli Sa'ar boats were developed and built in Haifa Shipyards under the leadership of Haim Schachal, the chief engineer of the Israel Shipyards. Two of the boats were launched a few months before the Yom Kippur War, INS Reshef (Flash) and INS Keshet (Bow), Sa'ar 4 class missile boats. For his leadership, Schachal was awarded the Israel Defense Prize. The Israeli Navy went on to win the sea battles with the Egyptian and Syrian navies with zero casualties and losses. The Israeli Navy became a pioneer in modern naval missile warfare, resulting in their successes in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

In 1931, the Bailey family of Wadmalaw Island allowed the scouts to camp in front of their plantation house. The Bailey family would eventually leave the entire plantation to the CCC, becoming Camp Ho Non Wah. In 1943, the council began its Order of the Arrow lodge‚ÄîUnali'Yi. In the 1960s, the council re-numbered their troops by district (i.e. Troop 29 became Troop 329 because they were in the third district). In the 1980s, the council office was moved from downtown Charleston to off of Sam Rittenburg Boulevard. In 2017 the Council office was again moved to its new location at 9297 Medical Plaza Drive in North Charleston after the sale of the Highway 7 property. 1920 ‚Äì Charleston Council is chartered. The Scout office was located at 207 East Bay Street in downtown Charleston. 1932 ‚Äì The Coastal Carolina Council acquires a Camp on the Bohicket River and it is christened Camp Ho Non Wah, which means \\"The Land of Rising and Falling Waters\\". 1940 ‚Äì The Coastal Carolina Council was formed with the merger of the larger Charleston Council, (formed in 1921) which covered Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties, with the smaller councils of Beaufort, Walterboro and Georgetown. 1940 ‚Äì Coastal Carolina Council acquires Camp Gregg in Dorchester County off Dorchester Road. Today the subdivision known as White Hall has been built. 1943 - 33 candidates go through the first Order of the Arrow Ordeal in May and Unali‚ÄôYi Lodge #236 is born at Camp Ho Non Wah. 1950‚Äôs ‚Äì Camp Moultrie was donated to Coastal Carolina Council by Santee Cooper for a Scout Camp and consist of 12 acres on Lake Moultrie. 1968 ‚Äì The Unaliyi Lodge ‚Äì Order of the Arrow and Scouts of the Coastal Carolina Council establish the Swamp Fox Trail in the National Forest. Originally its two trail heads were the Fire Tower at Awendaw and Huger State Park. The trail is named after General Francis Marion. In 1980 the trails was turned over to the National Trail System, this trail is now part of the Palmetto Trail that spans the entire state. 1979 ‚Äì Coastal Carolina Council sells Camp Gregg to investors. 1980s - The Coastal Carolina Council office was moved from downtown Charleston to off of Sam Rittenburg Boulevard. 2017 ‚Äì The Council office was again moved to its new location at 9297 Medical Plaza Drive in North Charleston after the sale of the Highway 7 property. CampsCamp Ho Non Wah= Camp Ho Non Wah is located on Wadmalaw Island at the intersection of the Bohicket River and the Fickling Creek, both tidal bodies of water. Ho Non Wah means the Land of the Rising and Falling Waters. In the 1980s the camp underwent a facelift, as many of its buildings were dated from the 1940s. The Bailey plantation house has never been destroyed, though, and has been converted to a permanent home for the OA lodge. =Camp Moultrie= Camp Moultrie is located on Lake Moultrie just outside Moncks Corner. The Camp is available for year round use, and offers a great opportunity for Boy Scout water front activities (Sailing, Kayaking, Canoeing, Swimming).

One major way in which cells respond to stimuli is through signal transduction pathways, whereby a ligand binds to a receptor, causing conformational changes that lead to a cascade of events in intracellular signalling molecules. This ultimately ends up in the translocation of transcription factors to the nucleus altering the expression of target genes, therefore affecting specific cellular functions. One way activation signals can be counteracted is through the triggering of different receptors bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic tails. Several transmembrane receptors are negatively regulated through recruiting cytosolic SH2 domain-containing proteins such as SHP-1 to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that they possess. ITIM-like motifs (KTIMs) were shown to exist in non-receptor proteins and to play a key role in their regulation. Difference between KTIM and ITIM The main difference between ITIM and KTIM is that KTIM was shown to be found in a cytosolic protein (IL-1 receptor-associated Kinase 1 (IRAK-1)) and not in a transmembrane protein such as the case with ITIMs. KTIM function KTIMs are speculated to play a regulatory role in the negative regulation of many kinases in addition to IRAK-1, and can thus represent a novel regulatory mechanism in a wide range of cellular kinases.Abu-Dayyeh I. et al.,2010.

(AE911Truth) is an American non- profit organization promoting the conspiracy theory that the World Trade Center was destroyed in a controlled demolition, disputing accepted conclusions around the September 11 attacks, including the 9/11 Commission Report, as well as FEMA's \\"WTC Building Performance Study\\" (2002) and instead advocates for World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories. Their claims and theories lack support among the relevant professional communities.  Activities  Two people holding a banner of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2010 Richard Gage, a San Francisco Bay Area architect, founded Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth in 2006. Gage's website states that he is a member of the American Institute of Architects and that he worked as an architect for 20 years and was involved in the construction of numerous \\"fireproof\\" steel-frame buildings. He became convinced of the need to create an organization that brings together architects and engineers after listening to an independent radio station interview with theologian David Ray Griffin. Gage has given speeches at conferences organized by supporters of the 9/11 Truth movement\\"9/11 Truth movement\\" is the collective name of individuals and organizations that are questioning the veracity of the results of the investigations by United States government agencies into the September 11 attacks. See ; ; ; ; . in various locations in the United States and Canada, and has presented his multimedia talk \\"9/11 Blueprint for Truth ‚Äì The Architecture of Destruction\\" in 14 countries. His presentations focus on the sequence of events leading to the destruction of the three World Trade Center buildings and include videos of their collapses alongside footage of controlled demolitions. He went on a tour of European countries in 2008 and gave speeches in Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 2009. In 2009, Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth had a booth at the annual convention of the American Institute of Architects. AIA media relations director Scott Frank has stated that \\"We don't have any relationship with his organization whatsoever.\\" The controversial two-hour movie 9/11 Blueprint for Truth, popular among members of the 9/11 Truth movement, is based on a presentation given by Richard Gage in Canada. Gage was also interviewed for an episode of the BBC television program The Conspiracy Files, an episode of the ZDF's series History, based on a co-production of the BBC and the ZDF, as well as for a documentary produced by the Canadian television news magazine The Fifth Estate. The organization is the main constituent of the ReThink911 coalition, which ran an advertising campaign putting up signs and billboards in seven U.S. cities, as well as in Vancouver, Toronto, London, and Sydney in 2013.  Advocacy  Ed Asner speaking in support of Richard Gage and Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth at an event in Los Angeles. Members of the organization argue that the buildings of the World Trade Center could not have collapsed only because of the impact of the planes, (Press agency report. Translation: \\"They argue that the Twin Towers were not destroyed by the impact of the planes.\\") or as a result of the fires that had been caused by them. On the one hand Gage has said that avoiding speculation on the attacks on the Pentagon or on the involvement of the Bush administration is critical to the mission of the organization. But on the other hand, Gage has said that if the destruction of the World Trade Center was the result of a controlled demolition, this would mean that part of what happened on September 11, 2001, would have been planned by \\"some sort of an inside group\\". According to Gage, an elevator modernization program that had taken place before the attacks would have provided an opportunity to get access to the core areas of the WTC towers without creating suspicion. Investigations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have concluded that the buildings collapsed as a result of the impacts of the planes and of the fires that resulted from them. In 2005, a report from NIST concluded that the destruction of the World Trade Center towers was the result of progressive collapse initiated by the jet impacts and the resultant fires. A 2008 NIST report described a similar progressive collapse as the cause of the destruction of the third tallest building located at the World Trade Center site, the 7 WTC. Many mainstream scientists choose not to debate proponents of 9/11 conspiracy theories, saying they do not want to lend them unwarranted credibility. The NIST explanations of the collapses are universally accepted by the structural-engineering and structural-mechanics research communities. \\"Universally though has the foregoing explanation of collapse been accepted by the communities of structural engineers and structural mechanics researchers, some outside critics have nevertheless exploited various unexplained observations to disseminate allegations of controlled demolition.\\" = World Trade Center towers = Gage criticized NIST for not having investigated the complete sequence of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, and claims that \\"the official explanation of the total destruction of the World Trade Center skyscrapers has explicitly failed to address the massive evidence for explosive demolition.\\" In particular, Gage argues that the buildings of the World Trade Center could not have collapsed at the speed that has been observed without tearing apart several columns of their structures with the help of explosives. To support its position, Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth points to the \\"free fall\\" acceleration of 7 WTC during part of the collapse, to \\"lateral ejection of steel,\\" and to \\"mid-air pulverization of concrete.\\" Gage also said that the absence of \\"large gradual deformations\\" associated with the collapse would indicate that the buildings have been destroyed by controlled demolition. That the three buildings of the World Trade Center \\"fell through what should have been the path of greatest resistance\\" would, according to the organization, require \\"precisely timed removal of critical columns, which office fires cannot accomplish\\". As the mass of the top of the North Tower had been blown outward during the collapse, there was \\"nothing left to drive this building to the ground,\\" Gage says. Gage maintains that the \\"sudden and spontaneous\\" collapse of the towers would have been impossible without a controlled demolition, that pools of molten iron found in the debris of the buildings were evidence of the existence of thermite, and that researchers had found unignited nano-thermite in the dust produced by the collapse of the World Trade Center. (Translation: \\"According to 430 architects and engineers belonging to the group AE911Truth, residues of the military explosive themate would have been found in the debris of Ground Zero [...].\\") Gage argues that this material \\"is not made in a cave in Afghanistan\\". Iron-rich micro-spheres, which, according to the organization, have been found in the dust of the World Trade Center buildings by independent laboratory analyses, would indicate temperatures during the collapses much higher than temperatures that would result from hydrocarbon fires. A DVD produced by the group contains eyewitness accounts of claimed explosions and flashes seen in the buildings. In 2008, Zdenƒõk P. Ba≈æant, professor of civil engineering and materials science at Northwestern University, published with three coauthors a paper to examine whether allegations of controlled demolition might be scientifically justifiable. They found that the available video records are not consistent with the free fall hypothesis, that the size of the concrete particles is consistent with comminution caused by impact, and that the high velocity of compressed air explains why material from the towers were ejected to a distance of several hundred meters from the tower. The authors conclude that the allegations of controlled demolition do not have any scientific merit. A spokesman for NIST said that any sightings of molten metal, including metal seen pouring from the South tower, were likely molten aluminum from the airplane, an explanation disputed by Gage who stated that the color of the molten metal rules out aluminum. \\"Basically, gravity and the utter force of the upper floors forced the towers down,\\" said NIST spokesperson Michael Newman. = 7 World Trade Center = According to Richard Gage, 7 World Trade Center (7 WTC), a 47-story high-rise building that was part of the World Trade Center complex and collapsed in the afternoon on September 11, 2001, is the \\"smoking gun\\" of September 11, providing the most compelling evidence that something was suspect about the building's collapse that had not been told to the public. (Translation: \\"Is 7 World Trade Center really the \\"smoking gun\\" of September 11, as Richard Gage, the prominent architect [...] says?\\") (Translation: \\"Gage's theory is that video of the collapse is \\"the smoking gun of September 11\\" and offers compelling evidence that something is being hidden from the public.\\") Gage also described 7 WTC as \\"the most obvious example of controlled demolition.\\" According to Gage, the only way to bring a building down with free-fall acceleration would be to remove its columns, which provide resistance to the force of gravity. Scott Grainger, a fire protection engineer and member of the group, told the BBC that the evidence he had seen indicated the fires in 7 WTC were scattered about on the floors and would have moved on as they would have found no more combustibles. He thus claims that the fires could not have developed enough heat to cause the collapse of the building. Gage dismisses the explanation of the collapse of 7 World Trade Center given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), according to which uncontrolled fires and the buckling of a critical support column caused the collapse, and argues that this would not have led to the uniform way the building actually collapsed. \\"The rest of the columns could not have been destroyed sequentially so fast to bring this building straight down into its own footprint,\\" he says. Gage argues that skyscrapers that have suffered \\"hotter, longer lasting and larger fires\\" have not collapsed. \\"Buildings that fall in natural processes fall to the path of least resistance,\\" says Gage, \\"they don't go straight down through themselves.\\" Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth also questions the computer models used by NIST, and argues that evidence pointing to the use of explosives had been omitted in its report on the collapse of 7 WTC. The community of experts in structural mechanics and structural engineering generally supports the explanation of the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings provided by the investigation conducted by NIST. (continues with a four-part scenario of progressive structural failure). In the case of 7 WTC, the appearance of a controlled demolition can be explained by an interior failure of the building, which is suggested by the sequence of the collapse of 7 WTC that shows roof elements sinking into the building while the fa√ßade remained intact. = Criticism of the official investigations = Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth has expressed concerns that evidence related to the destruction of the World Trade Center could have been distorted and covered up by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which conducted a building and fire safety investigation, one of the official investigations into the event. According to the group, and NIST themselves who considered it unnecessary, NIST did not look for physical evidence of explosives and did not include the eyewitness accounts from first responders and from people who escaped the buildings in their investigation. The organization also alleges that much of the physical evidence, apart from a few selected samples of the steel, would have been destroyed. Gage says that taped eyewitness interviews that were released to the New York Times in August 2005 had been \\"hidden by the city of New York\\". After the publication of the results of NIST's inquiry into the collapse of 7 WTC, Gage called a news conference, and leaders of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth dismissed NIST's investigation as flawed. When told of the claims, Shyam Sunder, lead investigator from NIST, responded: \\"I am really not a psychologist. Our job was to come up with the best science.\\" A spokesperson for NIST said the agency's computer models were highly reliable in assessing the amount of fireproofing dislodged, a factor that would not be present in other steel buildings cited by Gage. The organization supports Matt Campbell, brother of victim Geoff Campbell, who has compared the official investigation to the official narrative on the Bloody Sunday massacre in Northern Ireland in 1972, which was ultimately reassessed. The organization also supports the latest academic research into 9/11 truth by Dr. David A.

In turn the boy was abducted by his father in 2009 and smuggled back to Finland with the help of Finnish diplomats stationed at the Finnish consulate in Saint Petersburg. The incident has sparked a diplomatic row between Finland and Russia. The Finnish diplomat who helped to abduct the child was dismissed from the Finnish Consulate and Russia has declared him persona non grata.  Background  Anton's Finnish father and Russian Estonian mother met in Tallinn, Estonia in 1994 and married in 1997. The pair filed for legal divorce in 2002, which came into effect on 13 January 2003, but they continued to live together until 2005. Anton was born out of wedlock on 3 October 2003. At birth Anton was legally entitled to Russian citizenship, but the citizenship was never registered. He was registered as a Finnish citizen after the Finnish father's paternity had been established. His mother gained Finnish citizenship via naturalisation after the birth. After the divorce the parents had joint custody. From a previous marriage of his mother, Anton has an older, 19-year-old brother, whom she left in Finland. = Abduction by mother to Russia = Anton's mother left Finland with Anton without the consent of the father on 5 March 2008. The Russian Embassy in Finland assisted the mother with the Russian visa application. The signature of the father is presumed to have been forged on the application. The 65-year-old father blames a religious organization near the Russian Orthodox Church in Finland for the abduction, calling the Memorial Society of Saint Seraphim of Sarov () a sect. The lower court in Tampere ordered that the mother be detained on suspicion of child abduction. The order is only effective inside the European Union. Russia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The court also gave sole custody of the child to the father. In Russia Anton was granted Russian citizenship based on information provided by the mother. According to Uusi Suomi this sort of citizenship is normally granted in months, not in days. After locating the child and mother in Balakhna near Nizhny Novgorod the father initiated legal proceedings in Russia to regain custody and revoke the Russian citizenship. On 20 November 2008, the Balakhna City Court revoked Anton's Russian citizenship because his mother had presented false information for registration of citizenship. On 17 March 2009, the judicial board on civil cases of the Nizhny Novgorod regional court upheld the decision. After the decision, the father came to Russia to take Anton back to Finland. = Abduction by father = Russian online newspaper Grani.ru claimed that in April 2009 Anton was forcibly taken from his mother by his father outside her home on Ryazanova Street. The press service of Russia's Investigation Committee alleges that on 12 April 2009, the father, acting in conspiracy with persons unknown, attacked the mother and retrieved Anton. After allegedly being prevented from leaving Russia, the father and son took refuge at a vacant apartment of the Finnish Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg. The Russian authorities allegedly ignored the earlier Russian court decision and Anton's Russian citizenship was expeditiously re-instated on May 7. One day later, on 8 May, Anton was smuggled to Finland in the closed trunk of a diplomatic car by the legal consul at the Saint Petersburg consulate, Simo Pietil√§inen.  Diplomatic incident  The story was revealed on May 14 by the Finnish scandal paper 7 p√§iv√§√§ causing a diplomatic incident. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called his Finnish counterpart Alexander Stubb to protest and to demand an explanation. This was followed by a formal complaint. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Finland of a blatant violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which states that diplomats should strictly observe the laws of the host country. The formal complaint was followed by a formal diplomatic note on May 20. Diplomat Pietil√§inen, who helped take Anton out of Russia, was dismissed from the Finnish Consulate in St. Petersburg after the incident. Russia has declared Pietil√§inen persona non grata. The developments in St. Petersburg were closely followed by the Finnish government, including President Tarja Halonen, who condemned the behaviour of Simo Pietil√§inen The actions of the Finnish diplomat involved were defended by Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Stubb, whilst Tarja Halonen has condemned them. President Halonen, Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen and foreign minister Stubb all denied having prior knowledge of the smuggling plan or the involvement of Finnish diplomats in it.  Conflict of law  There is a conflict of law between Finland and Russia. It is a criminal offense under Finnish law for the Russian mother to take her child to Russia. It is a criminal offense under Russian law for the Finnish diplomat to take the same child from Russia back to Finland. This is why the Finnish diplomat was declared persona non grata. This is why the Russian mother faces parental abduction criminal charges in Finland.  Reactions  The incident has been widely covered in Finnish and Russian media in what some commentators have described as a media war. The Russian media have speculated that the incident will have a negative effect on Finland‚ÄìRussia relations. The case has also been compared to that of Eliza Andr√©. The Investigation Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's office has launched criminal proceedings against the father on suspicion of \\"pre-meditated kidnapping of a person by an organized group\\" under article 126 of the Russian Criminal Code.  Trial of mother in Finland  Anton's mother returned to Finland on 1 August 2009. She was arrested at the airport in the Tampere. A Finnish court considered the case of Anton's mother, and released her pending trial. However she was given a travel ban for the next 60 days.http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Lapsikaappauksesta+ep%C3%A4ilty+Anton+Salosen+%C3%A4iti+matkustuskieltoon/1135248158522 Helsingin Sanomat: Lapsikaappauksesta ep√§ilty Anton Salosen √§iti matkustuskieltoon Through the Russian media, Johan B√§ckman claimed that a Finnish police officer promised not to arrest Anton's mother, and furthermore the mother was allegedly arrested in Estonia's capital Tallinn. B√§ckman was presented as one of the aides or lawyers of Rimma Salonen, while the trial lawyer is Heikki Lampela in Finland and Dmitry Glazov in Russia. Finnish media have reported some claims as a matter of inquiry. The incident has been top television news in Russia. The main villains have been Anton's Finnish father and the Finnish diplomat Simo Pietil√§inen. Johan B√§ckman has had a central role as commentator about the incident in Russia and Finland. His comments and speculation have been published as such, without checkup, in many Russian media, such as Ria Novosti.–ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏: –§–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –æ–±–≤–∏–Ω–∏–ª–∞ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–∫—É –°–∞–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω –≤ –ø–æ—Ö–∏—â–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫–∞ Later, Rossiyanka interviewed the prosecutor, and corrected the false information: http://www.pravda.ru/news/society/18-09-2009/324434-sal-0 Later B√§ckman apologized his comments about the incident,Johan B√§ckman: Johan B√§ckmanin julkinen anteeksipyynt√∂ Paavo Saloselle (in Finnish)Helsingin Sanomat: Johan B√§ckman haluaa sovitella riidat Paavo Salosen kanssa (in Finnish) but he has later recanted and is again arranging demonstrations against Paavo Salonen. The Russian foreign ministry has made negative comments, and implied the negative effect of the incident to mutual relations between Russia and Finland. According to Finnish expert on Russia Ilmari Susiluoto, the case of Anton is part of the Kremlin public relations campaign. The Finns have too positive an image in Russia, and this does not fit the Kremlin's idea of the \\"hostile outside world\\". Rimma Salonen was given a one to five year suspended sentence for kidnapping and child abduction on 13 October 2009 in k√§r√§j√§oikeus (lower court). She also had to pay 20,000 euros for emotional distress to her son and almost 4,800 euros to Paavo Salonen. The next year, hovioikeus (the Finnish appeals court) upheld Salonen's suspended prison sentence. However, the court did lower the damages awarded Anton Salonen to 10,000 euros. The court also ordered her to pay 7,500 euros in legal fees for Anton and Paavo Salonen.  Aftermath  In May 2010, Russian Child Rights Ombudsman Pavel Astakhov accused the Finnish authorities of denying Anton the right to speak Russian. Astakhov also referred to statements of Johan B√§ckman that Finnish authorities had also banned Anton from praying, being baptized, or wearing crosses.Office of the Children Rights Ombudsman for the President of the Russian Federation: –ü. –ê—Å—Ç–∞—Ö–æ–≤ –Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω –æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∫ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—É –§–∏–Ω–ª—è–Ω–¥–∏–∏ –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—â–∞—é—â–∏–º—Å—è (in Russian) 18 May 2010 A Russian newspaper reported these claims and referred Anton's mother and B√§ckman to the Finnish Anti- Fascist Committee. In March 2011, Rimma Salonen announced she is a candidate for the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election for the Workers Party of Finland. She also represented the organization of Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee. Salonen got 16 votes.Electoral district of Helsinki Official results of Finnish Justice Ministry Russia joined the Hague Abduction Convention on 1 October 2011. In April 2012 Rimma Salonen appealed to the Russian people and called for help because, according to her, Western authorities are stealing talented and unique Russian children to supplant Western children who are just robots and sex dolls. In May 2013 Supreme Court of Finland decided not to give Rimma Salonen right to appeal for the ruling of Vaasa Hovr√§tt. This means Anton's father is his legal guardian as Vaasa Hovr√§tt ruled.

It is a Grade I listed building, The Victorian building is on the site of an earlier church which had fallen into disrepair, from which a stump of the tower remains in the churchyard. The piscina and a memorial in the vestry, were reused from the original church. One of the features of the church is an early electric clock and the first in England to have a striking mechanism. It was controlled from a master clock in the nearby house. The clock mechanism was taken to the Science Museum in London for restoration in 1984. It was made by Charles Shepherd who also made the Shepherd Gate Clock mounted on the wall outside the gate of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The interior walls of the church are decorated with sgraffito which is produced by applying layers of plaster tinted in contrasting colours to a moistened surface, or in ceramics, by applying to an unfired ceramic body two successive layers of contrasting slip, and then in either case scratching so as to produce an outline drawing. The decoration includes representations of Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah and the Annunciation. The technique is attributed to the Arts and Crafts Movement and, at Hornblotton, have been created by cutting away the upper coat of white cement and leaving exposed the strawberry coloured undercoat of plaster including terracotta patterns of sunflowers and leaves. The parish is part of the Six Pilgrims benefice within the deanery of Bruton and Cary.

German championship 1959  The 19-year-old striker Feigenspan moved in 1954 from FC Nieder-W√∂llstadt to VfB Friedberg in the first amateur league of Hessen. After only one season, he received an offer from Eintracht Frankfurt and eventually signed in 1955 at the Eagles for their Oberliga South campaign. At match day two, he debuted at the 5‚Äì3 away win at Stuttgarter Kickers. Together with Erich B√§umler, Hans Weilb√§cher, Richard Kress and Alfred Pfaff he formed the attack at Eintracht. In his first season 1955‚Äì56 he could appear in 13 matches, netting five goals. In his fourth season at Frankfurt, 1958‚Äì59, Paul O√üwald's Eintracht won the Southern German championship, hence reached the final round of the German championship and then the final match. To this success Ekko Feigenspan contributed 21 goals in 27 matches. In the final round the O√üwald team won all six matches against Werder Bremen, FK Pirmasens and 1. FC K√∂ln with Feigenspan he scoring nine more goals. In the final match on 28 June 1959 in Berlin, he could score three additional goals to the 5‚Äì3 win after overtime against rivals Kickers Offenbach. His offensive partners were Richard Kress, Istv√°n Szt√°ni, Alfred Pfaff and Dieter Lindner. After the championship win, he moved to 1860 M√ºnchen because he wanted to continue his engineering studies. In 79 Oberliga appearances for Eintracht he scored 52 goals. 1860 M√ºnchen and Rot- Wei√ü Essen, 1959 until 1967 Germany manager Sepp Herberger tested Feigenspan on 3 October and 8 November 1959 twice in the B squad against Switzerland and Hungary, but since Feigenspan had never caught a regular spot at the Lions from Munich in three seasons, he was not capped anymore. Alfred Hei√ü, Hans K√ºppers, Rudi Brunnenmeier and Johann Auernhammer were first choice striker for manager Max Merkel, so Feigenspan left 1860 in the summer of 1962 after 41 Oberliga appearances and 20 goals for the Western German club Rot-Wei√ü Essen playing in die 2nd Oberliga West. In the last season of the old league system (regional Oberligas) RWE reached the sixth rank and qualified for the second tier (Regionalliga West) for the 1963‚Äì64 season.

It was not released as a single. The song is, according to Downes, about \\"being on the road and making love to someone you don't really like\\", although music critics consider the song's subject having to do with a robot. The song was performed live in 2010, as part of the first performance of all the tracks from The Age of Plastic. Production \\"I Love You\\" is the fourth track of The Buggles' debut studio album The Age of Plastic, although it was not released as a single. Plastic was recorded in 1979, and was made on a budget of ¬£60,000. The backing track of \\"I Love You\\" was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, with mixing and recording of vocals held at Sarm East Studios. Gary Langan mixed the song on a Sunday in 1979, between 11:00 p.m./12:00 a.m. and 3:00/4:00 a.m. Langan has said that the song was \\"one of the best mixes I've ever done\\", and considered the song to be a \\"pukka mix\\".

Downes is also a vocalist on the track, which he sings through a vocoder. He said that \\"I Love You\\" was really about \\"being on the road and making love to someone you don't really like, while all the time you're wanting to phone someone who's a long way off.\\" Despite this, AllMusic, in their review of The Age of Plastic, considered the song to be about \\"a metaphorical love affair with a robot\\" that \\"explores modern man's relationship to, and dependence on, technology\\", and Craven Lovelace of the Grand Junction Free Press noted the song as an example of the increased popularity of robots as a musical subject in the early 1980s.

Vaccine-preventable deaths are usually caused by a failure to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner. This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. A vaccine that is generally recommended may be medically inappropriate for a small number of people due to severe allergies or a damaged immune system. In addition, a vaccine against a given disease may not be recommended for general use in a given country, or may be recommended only to certain populations, such as young children or older adults. Every country makes its own immunization recommendations, based on the diseases that are common in its area and its healthcare priorities. If a vaccine-preventable disease is uncommon in a country, then residents of that country are unlikely to receive a vaccine against it. For example, residents of Canada and the United States do not routinely receive vaccines against yellow fever, which leaves them vulnerable to infection if travelling to areas where risk of yellow fever is highest (endemic or transitional regions).Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Immunization Guide.

The name was chosen by TCI's social science director Marion Whidden as a complement to the company's Ishkooda and Muscoda camps. All three names appear in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem \\"The Song of Hiawatha\\".In the poem, Wenonah (from Dakota Sioux \\"winona\\" meaning \\"first-born daughter\\") is the daughter of Nokomis and mother of Hiawatha. Ishkooda (from Ojibwe Chippewa \\"ishkode\\" meaning fire) is a comet. And Muskoday (from Ojibwe Chippewa \\"mashkode\\" meaning \\"prairie\\") is a meadow The TCI camps were designated from west to east as: Muscoda Division Camp - mines #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, Wenonah Division Camp ( originally referred to as the TCI Fossil Division ) mines #6¬Ω #7, #8, #9, #10 and the Ishkooda Division Camp - mines #11, #12, #13, #14, #15. History The oldest TCI mine was in the Ishkooda camp #13, which opened in 1873 as part the Eureka Company Mines and was called Eureka #2 mine. The oldest Wenonah Camps were #7 and #10 where the mines opened in 1880, known then as the Alice mine - #7 and Redding mine - #10. Mine #6¬Ω, which opened in 1910 and other mines were listed on the 1916 Birmingham Mining District maps. Wenonah Number 6¬Ω was next to the Woodward Iron Company's Red Ore camp mine #2, which was on the #6¬Ω western boundary, and also near here was the location of the water reservoir that in about 1947 was replaced with a covered water tank, now owned by the Bessemer Water Works. The reservoir/tank is located in the Lipscomb area of Jefferson County. By 1900, TCI was operating 15 iron ore mines in the Birmingham District including the Wenonah #7, and #8 mining camps. In 1880, before TCI became the owner, the #7 mine was operated by T.T. Hillman and Henry DeBardeleben's Alice Furnace Company. The #7 mine in those days was called the Alice Mine and also sometimes referred to as the Hillman Mine. The Wenonah #8 mine, opened in 1887, was originally the Fossil Mine and was operated by the Smith Mining Company. Wenonah Mining Camp #7, later in 1940, became the site of the sintering plant that processed the iron ore before being transported via The High Line Railroad connection from Red Mountain to the Fairfield Works. The Highline was constructed in 1925. In 1914, TCI began ongoing facilities and programs to improve lives of employees with schools (Wenonah School), hospitals (Lloyd Noland Hospital), training programs and housing. Camp locations The oldest was Wenonah Camp #7 (circa 1880) as listed on the 1916 Birmingham Mining District maps. Number 6 1/2 was next to the Woodward Iron Company's camp #2 on its western boundary and was the location of the water reservoir that in about 1947 was replaced with a covered water tank, now owned by the Bessemer Water Works. The reservoir/tank is located in the Lipscomb area of Jefferson County. Wenonah Mining Camp #7 (1880-1938), located on the southwest boundary of Browns Station, was also the site of the plant that processed the iron ore before being transported via High Ore Line Railroad connection from Red Mountain to the Fairfield Works. Wenonah Camp #8 (1887-1938), was located just south of Hillman on the north side of Red Mountain, and is sometimes referred to as \\"New Hill\\". It was also the site of the company commissary, doctor's office and other administrative offices. Wenonah camp #9 was south of Grasselli Heights on the north side of Red Mountain. It was the location of the Wenonah School, built in 1917 on the current East Brownsville Park site, as part of the program to improve lives of employees. The #9 mine was opened in 1897 under contract to the Smith Mining Company and then was known as the Klondike mine. Wenonah Camp #10 (1880-1952), was located adjacent to West Goldwire and south of the current Wenonah High School. It is now known as Tarpley City. Mine closures In 1962, the TCI - US Steel Red Mountain ore mines closed in Birmingham District as material and labor cost begin to increase. Due to a higher grade, the ore in Venezuela began to be used. The last Iron Ore mine to close in the Birmingham district was the Woodward Company #4 (Pyne)mine, The Pyne Mine which was located just south of Bessemer, Muscoda and Readers Gap. The Pyne Mine closed in 1971. References *Rikard, Marlene Hunt (June 1981) \\"Wenonah: The Magic Word.\\" Journal of the Birmingham Historical Society.

In its early years the production took place in Gy≈ër with the help of only 50 professionals. In its most successful years, however, the company employed around 1000 (later even 2000) people and offered 334 different goods. History The predecessor of the company was established from Hermann Bach‚Äôs steam mill in Gy≈ërsziget and became the first biscuit factory of Hungary, in 1880. In 1892, however, Lajos Koestlin bought the factory. Koestlin had already had a biscuit factory in Bregenz, Austria but the competition was so stiff there that he moved to Hungary and brought all his equipment for biscuit-production with him in 6 stock-cars. He also invited 50 professionals and restarted work in the new country in 1900. The products of his factory included biscuits, rusk, ‚Äòcvibak‚Äô (rusk for the army), wafers and gingerbread. The company became successful, before the outbreak of the First World War it already employed about 1000 workers. As the fights started and the needs of the citizens of Hungary and of the army increased rapidly, the company fulfilled a rising number of orders ‚Äì the products of the Koestlin factory were demanded all over the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the factory in Gy≈ër became the acropolis of Hungarian biscuit-production. After the First World War the production was cut down because of the lack of ingredients, and the number of employees was reduced to around 500. To balance the situation, the factory started producing chocolates and bonbons in 1922 and candies in 1925. By 1926 the company was exporting to 14 countries, and in the 1930s it had 334 different kinds of products. In 1931 the company was reformed as a Public Limited Company and in spite of the effects of the Great Depression, it retained its variety of products. Under the German occupation, however, it was declared a factory for war efforts and restarted the production of only biscuits, wafers and rusk. In 1945 the factory again had to suffer from the lack of money and ingredients, so the production was suspended for 4 months after which the factory was ordered by the mayor of Gy≈ër to serve the public demands. The production halls were even let to the coalition of the Pesti Kereskedelmi Bank (Commercial Bank of Pest) and the Leipziger Vilmos Szesz √©s Cukorgy√°r (Liquor and Sugar Factory of Vilmos Leipziger). Although being nationalised in 1947, the factory was declared to be independent again in 1948 by the Minister of Agriculture of the time, and in 1950 the factory was reformed for the third time as the Gy≈ëri Keksz √©s Ostyagy√°r Nemzeti V√°llalat (National Company of Biscuit and Wafer Factory of Gy≈ër). In 1963 the status of the factory changed again, since all the 6 confectionery factories of the country were converted into a general one, namely the Magyar √âdesipari V√°llalat (Hungarian Confectionery Company). In the 1980s the factory was modernised several times and after the change of regime, the Gy≈ëri Keksz √©s Ostyagy√°r (Biscuit and Wafer Factory of Gy≈ër) was privatised by the British company, the United Biscuits in 1991 and was registered under the name Gy≈ëri Keksz Ltd. Between the late 1990s and the early years of the new century several important changes came into force: the headquarters of the company was shifted from Gy≈ër to Buda√∂rs in 1997, the French Danone bought the company from the United Biscuits in 2000 and in 2007 the Danone division together with the Gy≈ëri Keksz Ltd. was bought by the Kraft Foods. The headquarters of the company is presently in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r but production does not take place within the borders of Hungary any more. Product history At the very beginning of the history of the factory (in the times of Lajos Koestlin) produced biscuits, rusk, ‚Äòcvibak‚Äô (rusk for the army), wafers and gingerbread. In addition to these, in 1912, the company bought the licence of the Albert keksz (Albert biscuit ‚Äì probably named after the husband of Queen Victoria) from the British T&T; Vicars Company. In 1922 this repertoire was broadened with chocolates, bonbons and candies in 1922 and in 1925 respectively. Besides these, by 1926 jellies were included in the offer. In 1963, the production of the chocolate figures, bonbons, Christmas candies (szaloncukor), jellies, chewing gums, drops and rusks was suspended but in return, the factory got the right from other factories to produce gingerbread, wafers and babapisk√≥ta (a kind of sweet sponge-cake). In 1968, after the factory was enlarged by another division, the production of baking powder, vanilla-sugar, custard-powder and tea-flavourings could start. In 1976 due to a licence contract with the Dr. Oetker, the supply was broadened again. Moreover, in 1980 the Gy≈ëri Keksz received the licence of the Negro (A kind of candy known as the ‚Äòchimney-sweep of the throat.‚Äô Its original flavour was anise-menthol but today it is produced in various flavours; for instance, honey, eucalyptus and cherry- menthol.) After forming a joint venture with the HAAS Company (Linz, Austria), the factory (under the name Hungarocandy Kft.) started the production of the PEZ candies (a kind of pressed candy). Products today Today‚Äôs offer can be grouped along 10 categories: *the ‚ÄòJ√≥Reggelt‚Äô products: corn biscuits with various flavours *the ‚ÄòGy≈ëri √âdes‚Äô products: short biscuits with various flavours and sponge-cakes with 3 kind of fillings *the ‚ÄòNegro‚Äô products: candies with or without filling in 7 flavours *the ‚ÄòPil√≥ta‚Äô products: short biscuits with cream or jelly filling or with chocolate covering *the ‚ÄòTuc‚Äô products: salty crackers in salt, ham or paprika flavours *candies in 4 different flavours *the ‚ÄòGy≈ëri N√°polyi‚Äô products: wafers in 7 different flavours *the ‚ÄòAlbert‚Äô and ‚ÄòKorpovit‚Äô biscuits *the ‚ÄòTele‚Äô products: salty crackers in 6 different flavours *‚ÄòH√°ztart√°si keksz‚Äô: plain biscuit References *http://www.gyorikeksz.hu *http://hvg.hu/magyarmarka/20050329gyorikeksz.aspx *http://www.mfor.hu/cikkek/Edes_gyori_gurigak.html Category:Food and drink companies of Hungary Category:Hungarian brands Category:Gy≈ër ","title":"Gy≈ëri Keksz"},{"id":"22827020","text":"Qt Creator is a cross-platform C++, JavaScript and QML integrated development environment which simplifies GUI application development. It is part of the SDK for the Qt GUI application development framework and uses the Qt API, which encapsulates host OS GUI function calls. It includes a visual debugger and an integrated WYSIWYG GUI layout and forms designer. The editor has features such as syntax highlighting and autocompletion. Qt Creator uses the C++ compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection on Linux and FreeBSD. On Windows it can use MinGW or MSVC with the default install and can also use Microsoft Console Debugger when compiled from source code. Clang is also supported. History Development of what would eventually become Qt Creator had begun by 2007 or earlier under transitional names Workbench and later Project Greenhouse. It debuted during the later part of the Qt 4 era, starting with the release of Qt Creator, version 1.0 in March 2009 and subsequently bundled with Qt 4.5 in SDK 2009.3. This was at a time when the standalone Qt Designer application was still the widget layout tool of choice for developers. There is no indication that Creator had layout capability at this stage. The record is somewhat muddied on this point (perhaps due to changes in ownership or the emphasis on Qt Quick), but the integration of Qt Designer under Qt Creator is first mentioned at least as early as Qt 4.7 (ca. late 2011).http://qt- project.org/wiki/QtCreatorWhitepaper Ot Project site, Qt Creator Whitepaper. Unfortunately this document doesn't seem to include any reference to Qt or Qt Creator version numbers. That information is seen only on the 'parent' page that links to this one, http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.7/ (both accessed 12 August 2013) Currently (in the Qt 5 era) it is simply stated that \\"[Qt Designer's] functionality is now included as part of [sic] Qt Creator IDE.\\" Projects Qt Creator includes a project manager that can use a variety of project formats such as .pro, CMake, Autotools and others. A project file can contain information such as what files are included into the project, custom build steps and settings for running the applications.

Her works were first shown at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where she was a student. She won the Mary Smith Prize there in 1879 and the Charles Toppan prize in 1882. One of her teachers was the artist Thomas Eakins, who later became her husband. She made portrait and still life paintings. She was also known for her photography. After her husband died in 1916, Eakins became a prolific painter. Her works were exhibited in group exhibitions in her lifetime, though her first solo exhibition was held after she died. Early life She was the fifth of eight children of William H. Macdowell, a Philadelphia engraver and photographer, who also a skilled painter.

It was also shown at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.Thomas Eakins. A Drawing Manual. Philadelphia Museum of Art; 2005. . p. 7. Unlike many, she was impressed by the controversial painting and she decided to study with him at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, which she attended for six years. At that time Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts was considered the best art school in the United States. Before she studied with Eakins, she studied with Christian Schussele. Under Eakins, she adopted a sober, realistic style similar to her teacher's. She was an outstanding student and winner of the Mary Smith prize for the best painting by a matriculating woman artist. Her sister, Elizabeth, studied at the academy beginning in 1876, too. Other female art students were Mary Cassatt, Cecilia Beaux, Emily Sartain, and Alice Barber Stephens. They received a good education in art, but were restricted from painting nude male models. During her time as a student, she became class secretary, during which time she pulled for inclusion of women artists in the life-drawing classes of nude models. Marriage She married Eakins in 1884. As director of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Eakins had made the decision to use female and male nude models for the life studies classes for students of both genders. As a result of recriminations, he was asked to resign one year after their marriage. Even though he had support from some family and friends, it was a life-changing event that affected relationships in their lives and the Eakins' enthusiasm for life. Eakins spent most of her time supporting her husband‚Äôs career, entertaining guests and students, and faithfully backing him in his difficult times with the Academy, even when some members of her family aligned against Eakins. The couple had no children.

Between 1876 and 1882, Eakins exhibited her work at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While she was married, Eakins only painted sporadically. Both had separate studios in their home. She shared a passion for photography with her husband, both as photographers and subjects, and employed it as a tool for their art. She also posed nude for many of his photos and took images of him. In 1898 she became a member and exhibited her works at the Philadelphia Photographic Salon, including Child with Doll, one of her best photographs. She exhibited in 1905 at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. The Three Fates circa 1881 Of her paintings, Thomas Eakins said of her that she was more adept with color than he and that she was \\"as good as a woman painter as he had ever seen.\\" Susan Casteras, art historian, said of her Portrait of a Lady, made in 1880, that it showed her \\"firm handling and solid anatomical construction blended with generally dark tonalities.\\"Carol Kort; Liz Sonneborn.

After Thomas Eakin's death in 1916, she returned to painting, working nearly every day, adding considerably to her output. Her paintings were made in a style that became warmer, looser, and brighter in tone. In 1936 her works and those of her husband and sister Elizabeth were exhibited at the Philadelphia Art Club.

History The Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park began in 1994 as a collection of parrots, tortoises and monkeys all confiscated from illegal traders who were passing through Gibraltar. The local Customs authorities handed these animals to the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society (GONHS). In 1996 the Alameda Miniature Golf Course was cleared after many years of neglect and modified into a small conservation park, again entirely through volunteer help. Today Although the main purpose of the park was to house confiscated animals, it became apparent that, if finished properly, it could also be open to the public to make people aware not only about illegal animal trade but also about local wildlife conservation. The park has also become important for the care of native species that are considered for future re-introduction to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, such as the red fox, the raven and the Barbary partridge. The park has become an important educational resource for local schools, helping to raise awareness of not only the rich local biodiversity but also of wider conservation issues.

The \\"Institute\\" has a subsidiary, IOM Consulting Limited, which became fully independent in 1990 and now celebrates its 25th year within the IOM Group as an independent consultancy and also the commercial part of the IOM organization. It specializes in asbestos surveys and services, occupational hygiene services, nanotechnology safety, laboratory analysis and expert witness consulting services. IOM is therefore one of the UK's major independent \\"not for profit\\" centres of scientific excellence in the fields of environmental health, occupational hygiene and occupational safety. Its mission is to benefit those at work and in the community by providing quality research, consultancy, surveys, analysis and training and by maintaining an independent, impartial position as an international centre of excellence. Coal and pneumoconiosis The IOM was set up by Dr John Rogan, the chief medical officer of the NCB, who had initiated the Pneumoconiosis Field Research (PFR), persuaded the then chairman, Lord Robens, to found a scientific institute to take over the running of this research. The original senior members of staff, under Rogan, were Henry Walton, deputy director and head of Environment Branch, Dr Michael Jacobsen, head of statistics and Dr David Muir, head of Medical Branch. The early history of the IOM is inextricably bound up with the NCB and the PFR. The PFR had started in the early 1950s with the objective of determining how much and what types of coal dust caused pneumoconiosis and what airborne dust concentrations should be maintained in order to prevent miners from becoming disabled by the air they breathed. These ambitious and clear objectives were remarkably far-sighted, implying a requirement to measure both exposure to airborne dust and health outcomes in a large cohort of miners over a prolonged period, and to use these quantitative data to set protective health standards in the industry. 50,000 coalminers were eventually recruited into the study from 25 collieries representative of conditions across Britain. The early work involved measuring dust exposure by counting the number of particles collected from the air by sampling devices. A substantial advance was achieved with the measurement of exposure by weighing the dust collected by MRE 113a respirable dust samplers, which were invented specifically for the research by Henry Walton and Robert Hamilton. The first results from the PFR were reported in 1970 in the scientific journal Nature.Jacobsen M, Rae S, Walton WH, Rogan JM. (1971) New Dust Standards for British Coal Mines. Nature 227(5257): 445-447. The research underpinned the recommendations for more stringent airborne dust standards in British coalmines and the PFR was ultimately used as the basis for many national dust standards around the world. IOM's research in coal mining continued until about 1990, with many important scientific papers on respiratory diseases amongst miners having been published. In 1985, an important association between risk of pathological emphysema and dust exposure was demonstrated, leading ultimately to recognition of this disease as a quantifiable risk of coal mining. Recent analysis of the mortality of a subset of the miners originally studied has found an association between the risk of lung cancer and quartz exposure, and raised mortality from chronic lung disease and pneumoconiosis associated with increasing dust exposure. In the 1980s the IOM's epidemiological expertise was used in three original studies led by Dr Anthony Seaton into the effects of polyvinyl chloride dust, wool dust and shale mining on the lung health of workers. All showed positive associations and the results were used in regulatory standard setting in the UK and United States. This research into risks from inhaling dusts remains an important part of the IOM's research. The occupational exposure limits for crystalline silica continue to be a major international concern and from its previous research IOM has been able to define an exposure-response relationship for crystalline silica with unusual precision.Buchanan D, Miller BG, Soutar CA. (2003) Quantitative relations between exposure to respirable quartz and risk of silicosis. Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 60(3):159-164. This work demonstrated the need for very low limits on exposure to airborne crystalline silica because of the high risk of disease from even relatively brief exposures to high airborne concentrations. IOM studies have defined the relationships between decreases in lung function and dust concentrations amongst coal miners. These studies showed that dust control sufficient to prevent pneumoconiosis would reduce substantially the risks of impairment of lung function. However, an important question was whether these risks could be extrapolated to other occupational insoluble dusts. By developing and validating mathematical models of accumulated lung dust burden and resulting inflammation, IOM research has shown that the toxicity of several insoluble dusts of different compositions can be predicted from their surface area. Asbestos and other mineral fibres In 1971, Dr John MG Davies was recruited from Cambridge University to head a new Pathology Branch at IOM, and to continue his research into asbestos-related diseases. An extensive programme of research on the toxicology of fibres has shown that persistence of some asbestos fibres in the lung as a result of their insolubility was an important determinant of carcinogenicity and fibrogenicity, and that fibre length was also critically important in determining toxicity.Donaldson K, Brown GM, Brown DM, Bolton RE, Davis JM. (1989) Inflammation generating potential of long and short fibre amosite asbestos samples. British Journal of Industrial Medicine; 46: 271-276. This research expanded to consider fibres and other materials introduced as substitutes for asbestos, such as calcium silicate and aramid fibres. From 1990, the Colt Foundation, relevant industries and the Health and Safety Executive supported a programme of laboratory research into the health effects of man-made mineral fibres that helped to clarify the quantitative relationships between health risks and fibre dimensions and biopersistence.Miller BG, Searl A, Davis JMG, Donaldson K, Cullen RT, Bolton RE, Buchanan D, Soutar CA. (1999) Influence of fibre length, dissolution and biopersistence on the production of mesothelioma in the rat peritoneal cavity. Ann Occup Hyg; 43: 155-166. This work was awarded the prestigious Bedford Prize by the British Occupational Hygiene Society. In 1977, Henry Walton and Dr Steve Beckett invented a microscope eyepiece graticule used for counting asbestos fibres.Walton WH, Beckett ST. (1977) A microscope eyepiece graticule for the evaluation of fibrous dusts. Ann Occup Hyg; 20: 19-23. This device was designed to improve the reliability of the measurements and it has since become part of the international standard methodology for fibre measurement. A programme ensued on the measurement of fibrous aerosols such as asbestos, raising important issues in comparability of counts by different laboratories, and leading to the establishment of quality control schemes for asbestos. In 1979 the IOM was appointed by the Health and Safety Executive as the British Central Reference Laboratory for asbestos fibre counting, and the following year the World Health Organization similarly appointed IOM as its central reference laboratory for man-made mineral fibre counting. From 1985 IOM collaborated with the International Agency for Research on Cancer in a major European epidemiological study of the carcinogenicity of mineral wool fibres. As part of this work IOM helped develop novel methods to estimate retrospectively exposure of workers in the study, ultimately demonstrating that there was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of these fibres on the lung. IOM scientists also conducted a study of the respiratory health of workers manufacturing Refractory Ceramic Fibre in Europe, showing small though inconsistent effects on respiratory health associated with inhalation of these fibres. Workplace exposure, measurement and modelling From its earliest years, IOM has had a tradition of using quantitative exposure measurements to explore links between the working environment and health and has pioneered the development of new methods to measure the concentration of aerosols in ways that are relevant to human biology. The MRE 113A respirable dust sampler developed for use in our pneumoconiosis research was the first landmark and led to greater insight into the causes of this disease. Under Dr Jim Vincent's leadership, an innovative research programme, begun by Dr Trevor Ogden, was aimed at designing new sampling instruments for coarser aerosols. The culmination of this work was the development of the IOM inhalable dust sampler, which has become established as the device of choice for measuring the part of an aerosol that penetrates beyond the larynx.Vincent JH, Mark D. (1986) A new personal sampler for airborne total dust in workplaces. Annals of Occupational Hygiene; 30: 89-102. IOM scientists played a key role in defining the internationally agreed size fractions of dust relevant to human lung disease, i.e. inhalable, thoracic and respirable. Research on chemical exposure has more recently focussed on exposure modelling, data management and studies for regulatory risk assessment. Studies in relation to metals, including dermal exposure to nickel, zinc and lead, have been carried out. Work on the measurement of exposure to oil mist aerosol and vapour has been undertaken for offshore oil workers. In collaboration with some of the leading European human exposure scientists, IOM has been developing a new generation exposure model for use in connection with the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulations in Europe ‚Äì the model is known as the Advanced REACH Tool or ART. IOM scientists have developed a strong interest in the assessment of dermal exposure, leading to the enumeration of new principles of exposure assessment, the development of predictive exposure models, and investigations into dermal exposure under specific working conditions. Estimating historical skin exposures of farmers dipping sheep in pesticide solutions for an epidemiological study proved particularly challenging, but this research demonstrated a strong association between concentrated organophosphate pesticides and neurological symptoms.Pilkington A, Buchanan D, Jamal GA, Gillham R, Hansen S, Kidd M, Hurley JF, Soutar CA. (2001) An epidemiological study of the relations between exposure to organophosphate pesticides and indices of chronic peripheral neuropathy and neuropsychological abnormalities in sheep farmers and dippers. Occup Environ Med; 58: 702-710. As a consequence the UK government withdrew these pesticides from the market until safer handling systems were devised. In addition, new sampling instruments to measure dermal exposure to chemicals and new theoretical models to help understand how skin exposure may arise. These instruments and models may in the future help provide more reliable assessments of the risks from chemicals to the skin. IOM scientists are also developing a molded cassette with a 15mm inlet for use as a personal sampling pump to test inhalable dust levels. Other research at IOM has shown that chronic fatigue is common amongst those who consider their health is affected by pesticides and suggested there was an association between exposure to organophosphates and chronic fatigue symptoms. Human sciences and personal protective equipment Early ergonomics research at IOM, particularly under the direction of Tom Leamon, helped to promote greater safety of coal miners and to increase the cost- effectiveness of production.Simpson G. (1984) An ergonomics service to industry: The IOM Ergonomics Branch. Ergonomics; 175: 1-6. One of the IOM's most important contributions in ergonomics was in machine and system design, work that was passed to the manufacturers and contributed widely to worker safety and efficiency. Work on human factors and personal protective equipment (PPE) at the IOM started in the early 1970s, with studies of the impact of resistance to breathing caused by respirators, and resulted in guidance criteria that form part of respirator product standards to this day. In the 1980s and 1990s work continued with investigation of the utility of cooling garments such as ice jackets in hot environments, studies of the use and effectiveness of hearing protection, of the effectiveness of respirators in reducing exposure in the workplace, and of heat strain imposed by breathing apparatus. This latter work resulted in the development of permissible work times consistent with safe use of breathing apparatus, standards currently used by the UK Mines Rescue service. The PPE research has used ergonomic principles to design protective clothing and equipment that impose fewer demands on those required to use them. For example, IOM scientists helped develop improved powered helmet respirators following research that showed existing devices to be heavy, cumbersome, uncomfortable and intrusive. In the 1990s, on behalf of the UK fire service, studies were carried out of the physiological and ergonomic impacts of breathing apparatus, fire hoods and protective clothing. The studies on fire hoods showed that, contrary to common belief, they did not affect the ability of firefighters to localise sound. This led to a recommendation by the UK Home Office that all fire fighters should routinely be issued with such hoods, advice which is now followed throughout the UK. The IOM has helped to assess Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protective clothing for the Home Office, and has recently assisted London Fire Brigade in the ergonomic assessment for selection of new protective clothing. IOM has won three awards from the Ergonomics Society most recently the President's Medal,(2009) for the work led by Dr Richard Graveling on personal protective equipment. Environment and health In the early 1990s, the IOM became involved in a series of projects in the European Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development that addressed, amongst other things, the public health effects of air pollution from fossil fuel power plant. These first steps in quantitative environmental Health Impact Assessment (HIA) led over time to further work, including involvement in the cost-benefit analysis of the European Commission's Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) programme, followed by some ground- breaking work on the use of life table methods to estimate the impacts of air pollution on mortality. This HIA work has expanded into health effects of other occupational and environmental pollutants and into public health more generally, leading to the establishment of the IOM's Centre for Health Impact Assessment. IOM scientists have investigated exposure of bystanders living or working near to fields that have been sprayed with pesticides and have undertaken a study to model the exposure of the British population to selected pesticides from food and other sources. This work demonstrated that although it is likely that most people are exposed to low levels of a wide variety of pesticide compounds it is unlikely that such exposure would have measurable effects on the health of the population. In 1995 the Soufriere Hills volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat erupted, spewing volcanic ash containing large amounts of the crystalline silica mineral cristobalite over the surrounding area.Baxter PJ, Bonadonna C, Dupree R, Hards VL, Kohn SC, Murphy MD, Nichols A, Nicholson RA, Norton G, Searl A, Sparks RSJ, Vickers BP. (1999) Cristobalite in Volcanic Ash of the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, British West Indies. Science 19 February: 1142-1145. IOM scientists investigated the health of people who lived on the island. In general the exposure of the residents was low, because most people lived well away from the area of highest ash falls, and the ash proved of relatively low toxicity. The studies of the population showed no impairment of the islanders' respiratory health. Environment and health is now a well-established area of the IOM's work, involving chemical monitoring, laboratory analysis, consultancy, literature reviews and collaborative primary research. It covers exposures to and health effects of a wide range of environmental hazards, including outdoor and indoor air pollution, ionising radiation and electromagnetic fields, dioxins and pesticides. Consultancy IOM's research has helped to set standards and inform regulatory processes over the years, and this created the opportunity to offer consultancy services to customers in industry and elsewhere, to help them achieve best practice and comply with the law. Over the years, this advice has often been based on knowledge gained during their research work. The IOM have provided consultancies to a wide range of customers since the mid-1970s. In the beginning, the main impetus for the work came from Jim Dodgson, who built up occupational hygiene and chemical analysis in Edinburgh and in their regional offices (then in South Wales, the Midlands and Tyne and Wear). Then, as now, a substantial proportion of the work was related to asbestos sampling and analysis in buildings, industrial plant and contaminated land. IOM were amongst the first to introduce asbestos clearance indicators in the UK ‚Äì ahead of the Health and Safety Executive. Thirty years ago IOM were already developing their occupational hygiene business in a variety of other directions. Countless surveys of occupational exposures to hazardous gases, liquids, fumes, dusts and fibres have been undertaken. They have advised on control methods for hazardous agents, from elimination or substitution, to organisational changes or the introduction of personal protective equipment. Through the 1980s the consultancy work developed to include ergonomics and occupational medicine. By the time IOM became independent from British Coal in 1990, the consultancy work accounted for about 45% of the work. The consultancy work grew steadily after independence, increasingly centred on the Edinburgh office. In 1998, IOM expanded this sector of the business and Dr Alastair Robertson was appointed to lead this development. A key objective was to expand geographically, and regional offices were opened in Chesterfield, London and Stafford. By the end of 2008‚Äì2009, this type of work had grown over fourfold, accounting for over 70% of the IOM's turnover. The consultancy work now covers the safety of nanoparticles, asbestos management, occupational hygiene, ventilation verification/validation, occupational medicine, stress management, ergonomics, expert witness reports, the general environment and many laboratory analyses. The IOM work for government agencies, universities, the NHS, local authorities, private healthcare providers, large industrial concerns and small businesses, mainly within the UK but there also across the world, from Chile to Kazakhstan, from Zimbabwe to the United States of America and from St Helena to Montserrat. Nanomaterials Since 2002, led by Dr Rob Aitken, IOM has pioneered the assessment and management of hazards arising from nanotechnologies. Nanotechnologies are concerned with the development of new materials at the nanometre scale, materials that have novel and exciting properties and applications. Nanomaterials have been the subject of massive financial investment worldwide. However, it has been recognised that they may also represent hazards to the health of workers, consumers or the environment. Together with partners in the University of Edinburgh, Napier University (group now at Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh) and the University of Aberdeen, IOM formed the SnIRC initiative (Safety of nanoparticles Interdisciplinary Research Centre) and with them have embarked on a programme of fundamental research, funded by the European Commission and others, on questions related to toxicity, exposure and risk. The IOM and its partners have published a series of influential reviews on aspects of safe usage including patterns of use, regulation, food, and environment, sponsored by UK Government departments, in order to set UK Government policy in this area. Independently the IOM have published research strategies designed to address the many complex challenges to be faced.Maynard AD, AitkenRJ, Butz T, Colvin V, Donaldson K, Oberd√∂rster G, Philbert MA, Ryan J, Seaton A, Stone V, Tinkle SS, Tran L, Walker NJ, Warheit DB. (2006) Safe handling of nanotechnology. Nature; 444(7117): 267-269. IOM now leads a large international study on the toxicology of nanoparticlesl involving 21 partner organisations from across Europe and the USA. With UK Government support IOM has established SAFENANO,SAFENANO. IOM. Retrieved June 1, 2009. the most comprehensive free information resource on these issues available today. Using all available information, SAFENANO provides industry with state-of-the-art services in toxicology, exposure and risk assessment to help understand and mitigate potential risks to workers, consumers and the environment. SAFENANO is now Europe's Centre of Excellence on Nanotechnology Hazard and Risk. The development of new products containing carbon nanotubes has raised concerns that such materials may present risks similar to mineral fibres. Professor Ken Donaldson and others have published data on some of these materials showing similar toxicological responses as to asbestos, implying that exposure to some types of carbon nanotubes could carry similar hazard.Poland CA, Duffin R, Kinloch I, Maynard A, Wallace WAH, Seaton A, Stone V, Brown S, MacNee W, Donaldson K. (2008) Carbon nanotubes introduced into the abdominal cavity of mice show asbestos-like pathogenicity in a pilot study. Nature Nanotechnology; 3: 423-428. While more research is needed on the toxicology and potential exposures to these materials, action has already been taken by regulators to reduce possible risks to workers. Singapore office On 3 September 2012, the IOM opened its new research, consulting and services business in Singapore. The IOM received support from the Economic Development Board of Singapore, UK Trade and Industry, and Scottish Development International in establishing its presence. The business focus will initially be on the safe use of nanomaterials in emerging technologies and occupational hygiene. The key people in the team consist of Dr. Rob Aitken (managing director), Dr. Michael Riediker (director of SAFENANO) and Zephan Chan (head of occupational hygiene). In June 2013, Singapore experienced the worst situation of haze problem in history.IOM Singapore have received several enquiries from their clients about good control measures to protect employees in workplaces. IOM Singapore developed a short note to assist Singapore employers to comply with the MOM recommendations by providing further information about good practice. In September 2013, IOM Singapore celebrated their first anniversary, a new bi- month e-newsletter was launched.

Derek and Nancy Haysom had disapproved of Soering's relationship with their daughter. For her role in the deaths, Elizabeth Haysom was convicted of two counts of accessory before the fact to murder. The killings took place at the Haysom's residence in the unincorporated hamlet of Boonsboro, Bedford County, Virginia in March 1985. S√∂ring (along with Elizabeth Haysom) fled the United States shortly after. They were arrested in London in April 1986. His fight against extradition led to the landmark judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Soering v United Kingdom that establishes that extradition to the United States is illegal if the accused faces the death penalty. S√∂ring was extradited after the authorities in Bedford County gave assurances that they would not seek the death penalty. Following his arrest in 1986, S√∂ring confessed to the murders during interrogation by police but at his trial in 1990 he pleaded not guilty, claiming he confessed to shield Haysom from prosecution, believing that he had diplomatic immunity. S√∂ring was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. Alleging irregularities in the investigation leading to his arrest and in his trial, in the years following his conviction S√∂ring filed a number of legal appeals and post-conviction petitions. All were rejected by the courts. Prior to being granted parole in November 2019, fourteen parole requests were denied and numerous petitions for a gubernatorial pardon were unsuccessful. His parole was granted in November 2019, with S√∂ring being deported back to Germany and barred from entering the United States. During his incarceration, S√∂ring converted from Buddhism to Roman Catholicism and wrote multiple books about his life in prison and his religious beliefs. His 2007 book The Convict Christ was awarded first prize by the Catholic Press Association of North America in the category, \\"Social Concerns\\". Early life and education Jens S√∂ring was born on 1 August 1966 in Bangkok as the son of a German diplomat, Klaus S√∂ring. He moved to the United States in 1977 and graduated from The Lovett School in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1984. He then attended the University of Virginia where he entered into a relationship with fellow student Elizabeth Haysom. Crimes, confessions and extradition In March 1985, when S√∂ring was 18 and Haysom was 20, Haysom's parents, Derek (born 1913) and Nancy Haysom (born 1931), were murdered in their home in the then unincorporated hamlet of Boonsboro, in Bedford County, Virginia. Six months after the murders, with investigators closing in on the couple, S√∂ring and Haysom fled to England where they lived under assumed names. On 30 April 1986, S√∂ring and Haysom were arrested for fraud after writing over $5,000 ($ today) in fake checks, using false papers, and lying to the police in London, England. Under questioning by British, American, West German and Virginia authorities, S√∂ring confessed to the double murder several times to several authorities, including medical persons. Haysom waived extradition. S√∂ring fought extradition on the basis that the capital punishment and especially the exposure to the so-called death row phenomenon, i.e. the emotional distress felt by prisoners on death row constitute inhuman or degrading treatment as forbidden by Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. On 7 July 1989, the European Court of Human Rights agreed with this assessment and ruled in Soering v United Kingdom that extradition to countries where the accused faces the death row phenomenon is unlawful. After this decision, the authorities in Bedford County agreed not to pursue the death penalty and S√∂ring was extradited to the United States on 12 January 1990. Trial and conviction Haysom pleaded guilty and then testified against S√∂ring. At trial, Haysom testified that S√∂ring committed the murders and that she was an accessory to the crime. S√∂ring was tried for two counts of first degree murder in 1990. According to the prosecution, S√∂ring committed the murders and Haysom was an accessory before the fact. S√∂ring pleaded not guilty, stating he made a false confession to protect Haysom, as he assumed he would have diplomatic immunity. Yet during his four year detainment in London, he did not mention this topic.https://soeringguiltyascharged.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/the- detectives-report-by-terry-wright-final.pdf S√∂ring was sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Haysom was sentenced to 90 years imprisonment (one 45-year sentence for each murder, to be served consecutively). She had a mandatory release date in 2032 when she would have been 68 years old., but was released concurrently with S√∂ring and deported to Canada in December, 2019.https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-new-chapter-in-a-double- murder-case = Alleged irregularities = Since the trial, S√∂ring has raised several issues regarding his trial: Richard Neaton, S√∂ring's defense attorney, was subsequently disciplined and eventually disbarred for reasons unrelated to S√∂ring's case, and admitted to having had a drug problem while representing S√∂ring; moreover, the judge, William M. Sweeney, knew Nancy Haysom's brother (Elizabeth's uncle) and had presided over Elizabeth's court proceeding. Ed Sulzbach, a FBI profiler who according to some familiar with the case was asked to consult, concluded that the crime had been committed by a female who knew the Haysoms, settling on Elizabeth as the likely killer. The detective working on the case, Ricky Gardner, denied that a profile had been created by Sulzbach. No report was entered into evidence at S√∂ring's trial. A blood- smeared sock print was introduced as main evidence against S√∂ring. The prosecution's expert witness, Robert Hallett, who was not an expert on footprints, claimed that he was able to match it perfectly to S√∂ring. An FBI agent interviewed by WVTF in 2018 dismissed the witnesses' methods as a \\"magic trick\\" and noted that Sulzbach had matched the sock to a female in his report. In 2009, the 42 pieces of DNA evidence from the crime scene were tested (technology was previously not sufficiently advanced). Of the 42, 31 were either too small or degraded to yield results. The 11 samples successfully tested excluded both S√∂ring and Elizabeth Haysom. Further investigations and parole requests Jens S√∂ring began to be eligible for parole in 2003. His twelfth parole request was denied at the beginning of 2017. A petition for an absolute pardon was filed on 22 August 2016. Chuck Reid, one of the original investigators of the Haysom murders, has occasionally agreed to be interviewed about the case. His participation in the 2016 documentary The Promise led him to take his long-standing doubts about the outcome more seriously. On 3 May 2017, Albemarle County Sheriff J. E. \\"Chip\\" Harding released a 19-page report on a months-long investigation he had conducted on this case. He concluded that Jens S√∂ring is innocent and asked Governor McAuliffe to pardon him. On 27 September 2017, Harding held a press conference and advocated for S√∂ring's release together with another investigator, Richard L. Hudson Jr. They also presented expert testimony of three forensic scientists who agreed that S√∂ring's DNA did not match the blood found on the crime scene. On October 10, 2017, Germany's ambassador Peter Wittig and its former president Christian Wulff, amongst S√∂ring's Counsel Steven Rosenfield and others, attended S√∂ring's 13th parole hearing. Following this hearing, Wittig told the assembled media \\"We are deeply convinced of the innocence of Jens S√∂ring.\\" On October 27, 2017, a further press conference was held by Gail Starling Marshall, former Deputy Attorney General of Virginia, where S√∂ring's counsel, Steven Rosenfield, announced that the University of Richmond School of Law's Institute for Actual Innocence supports S√∂ring's pardon petition based on the DNA evidence excluding S√∂ring. On 25 November 2019, Governor Ralph Northam accepted the Virginia Parole Board's recommendation to release both Haysom and S√∂ring. Though neither will receive a gubernatorial pardon, both were released into the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation to their home countries of Canada and Germany. Both remain ineligible to reenter the United States. On 17 December 2019 S√∂ring returned to Germany by landing in Frankfurt.

The virtuoso plays rapid sequences thanks to his ability to play up to 19 notes per second (with each hand). These overtones blend or clash according to harmonic changes. Most of his music is for piano, but he has also composed chamber and orchestral works. According to the pianist, his piano music requires a special technique, closely related to the Martial Arts, and is too complex and difficult for any concert pianists to play. Because of his lifelong devotion to the piano, he has been called The Prophet Of The Piano.  Biography  Melnyk lived in Paris from 1973 to 1975, supporting himself by playing for modern dance classes, most notably in conjunction with Carolyn Carlson at the Paris Opera. Many of his works were presented in conjunction with modern dance. Through his work with Carolyn Carlson, he began to create continuous music for piano. Melnyk has composed over 120 works, mostly for piano solo and double piano, and some for piano with ensemble. To explain the proper physical and mental techniques for his music, Melnyk wrote a treatise, OPEN TIME: The Art of Continuous Music (1981) and 22 Etudes, to teach the fundamental levels of his continuous technique. In 1985, Lubomyr Melnyk set two world records, documented on film and with full audio, at the Sigtuna Stiftelsen in Sweden. He sustained speeds of over 19.5 notes per second in each hand, and played between 13 and 14 notes per second for one full hour.

It is based on Fanboy, an animated short created by Robles for Nicktoons and Frederator Studios, which was broadcast on Random! Cartoons. The series was first broadcast October 12, 2009 on Nickelodeon as a preview, then officially premiered on November 6, 2009 after SpongeBob's Truth or Square. In the show, two slow-witted would-be superheroes attempt to rid their town of Galaxy Hills of evil, while annoying everyone around them. The series premiere drew 5.8 million viewers. The second episode was watched by 5.4 million viewers. The series won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Animated Program at the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards. The series initial release finished November 2, 2012, with one episode, \\"Brain Freeze\\", being released only on DVD in 2011, instead of being broadcast until it was finally aired on television on July 12, 2014.http://www.zap2it.com/tv/fanboy- and-chum-chum/episodes/SH011889340000 The theme song was written by Brad Joseph Breeck and performed by experimental punk band The Mae Shi. Plot The series centers around Fanboy and Chum Chum, a pair of hyperactive, odd, energetic, and slow-witted best friends enthusiastically obsessed with superhero comics, particularly those featuring their favorite superhero Man- Arctica, who also apparently seems to double as a holiday figurehead parodying Santa Claus within the series. Many episodes are based around comical parodies of famous films or contain countless references to popular culture, chronicling Fanboy and Chum Chum's exaggerated, surreal daily experiences and misadventures relating to dilemmas in which they have entangled themselves or the surrounding characters' utter infuriation with their irritating antics.

Bynum of Animation Insider called Fanboy & Chum Chum \\"a fun show that deserves a good look. The quality animation helps counterbalance the immense amount of dialogue from the series' chatty characters, and the sheer comedy of marginally competent comic-loving kids helps outweigh what might otherwise be a binge of geeky annoyance. But overall, Fanboy & Chum Chum is a lot of fun.\\" Variety praised the series' \\"bright, energetic look and even an appealing premise in theory\\". David Hinckley of NY Daily News gave the series three stars out of five, and said that \\"it's good [but] might not be the next SpongeBob\\". KJ Dell'Antonia of Slate found the main characters irritating, and thought the whole concept was unoriginal, with \\"many tired jokes and not enough of that kind of mild satire to make this play in our house\\".

It is located in Kavarna Municipality, Dobrich Province, on the Black Sea coast. The population was 76 in 2009. Yailata National Archaeological Reserve is located two kilometers south of the village.  History  Old names Kamennik - Medieval, not sufficiently confirmed. Kaya Bey Kyo - by the Ottoman authorities - literally translated \\"The Village of the Stone Master\\". The name of the village originates from the lone rock in front of the Little Egg on the seashore in front of the village, symbolizing its location, as well as in general the rocky coast about kilometers high, not less than 30 meters high. In the area is also the Yaylata locality, which is a huge stone formation. St√¢nca - during the Roman rule of 1919‚Äì1940. Only Bulgarians live in Kamen Bryag, some of whom are descendants of immigrants from the Balkans (Kotlensko and Elensko), and another part - descendants of immigrants from Romania - who came in the early 1940s as a result of the Craiova Agreement. Like most villages in the area, the elderly population before the migration of Balkanis belongs to the Gagauz ethnographic group.  Population  The population of the village consists entirely of ethnic Bulgarians, descendants of settlers from the Balkan Mountains (Kotel and Elena regions) and Southern Romania. A compact group of ethnic Bulgarians, who previously inhabited Northern Dobruja, settled in Kamen Bryag as a result of the Treaty of Craiova. As of the 2000s, the village is a popular summer holiday destination. = Cultural and natural sights = 2 km south of the village is the archeological site \\"Yailata\\" with numerous tombs, stone dwellings and an early Byzantine fortress wall. To the northwest of the village is a large necropolis of Scythian tombs. At the entrance of Yailata, a Thracian altar of the sun is discovered and cleared. There are a number of megalithic monuments along the high coasts north and south of the village. On July 25, 2007, an information center was opened in the village providing information about the Yaylata archeological reserve and other tourist sites in the region. About 1.5 km from Yailata is the Lamb, a gas field from the late 1950s that has been burning to this day.

The episode was written by playwright Julia Cho and consulting producer Jason Cahill, and was directed by Christopher Misiano. The episode focuses on Fringe Division's efforts in finding a man with the uncontrolled ability to affect electrical energy, thanks to the work of a wanted rogue scientist. Meanwhile, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) sees visions of her deceased lover, John Scott (Mark Valley). The episode's premise began with the idea of a computer virus being able to spread to humans, which then evolved into the story of a man who comes into his unique abilities. Series consultant Glen Whitman noted the premise was based on the \\"very very weak magnetic field\\" of electrical energy surrounding humans that an EEG detects, and the writers simply amplified this. The special effects crew undertook much preparation to simulate a chase sequence involving an exploding transformer, leading guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach to note how scary the effect was to film. It first aired in the United States on October 14, 2008 on the Fox network, and was seen by an estimated 9.157 million American viewers, the network's second-highest-rated show for the week. Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive, as many believed the series was finally finding its footing. Others, however, critiqued the episode for seeming too ordinary for a science fiction series. Plot Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy delivery boy who lives with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in an elevator, Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone. Meegar's angst then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is able to walk away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him. Olivia reveals to Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) about her encounter with her deceased lover John Scott (in the previous episode). She, Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrive at the scene, where they determine that the deceased were electrocuted before the impact, and that the elevator did not fall, but drove down. Furthermore, Walter detects electromagnetic energy in the area. Meanwhile, Meegar inadvertently causes a packaging machine to malfunction, severely injuring his boss right after Meegar is fired. He later reveals to his mother that some time ago he answered a magazine advertisement promising to \\"unlock [his] hidden potential\\", and although he has no knowledge of what has been done to him, he believes that what he has done was a result of being experimented on. A further panicked Meegar then causes his mother's pacemaker to fail, and she dies. The team becomes aware that a human has the uncontrolled ability to affect electrical energy, made this way by Jacob Fischer (Max Baker). Fischer is a rogue scientist wanted by Interpol, who experimented on humans by luring his victims through bogus ads. Olivia continues to encounter John Scott, who promises her that he does love her, and will prove it. Through him, Olivia realizes that someone survived the elevator impact. Now aware of Meegar's identity, they attempt to track him. However, Meegar is captured by Fischer who wishes to perform further tests on him. Walter finds Meegar's Walkman and uses its cassette tape to find a unique electromagnetic signature, then has homing pigeons guide Olivia, Peter, and Charlie to his location. Alerted by the FBI's arrival, Fischer attempts to leave with Meegar, who escapes. After Fischer is apprehended, Meegar attempts to flee, but he's also caught. They send Meegar to a hospital to be examined. Walter realizes Olivia is seeing Scott, and reveals she's not hallucinating. He theorizes that when both minds were linked during Scott's coma (in \\"Pilot\\"), a part of Scott's consciousness has embedded itself within hers. Later, while driving home, she spots Scott again. He leads her to a basement where Scott has been running his own Pattern-related investigations. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) hands Olivia some of Scott's personal effects. Among them she finds an engagement ring, proving Scott's claim to have loved her. Production \\"Power Hungry\\" was written by consulting producer Jason Cahill and playwright Julia Cho, each of which would go on to write other first season episodes. Christopher Misiano directed the installment. According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to \\"justify it scientifically.\\" For \\"Power Hungry\\", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, \\"And through kneading that idea over and over again, we came up with the idea of a character, Joseph, who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices.\\" New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. \\"It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads,\\" he said. \\"And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'\\"? The chase scene involving Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as the crew had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a \\"mechanical trip\\" to support an electrical cable, which he then strung to the other side of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the fuse box with \\"sparking devices\\", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, \\"What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable will go up, sparking down to the ground.\\" Misiano said of the sequence, \\"This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up. It really blew!\\" The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, \\"that was actually really scary\\" to film. After he filmed his character hitting Joseph with a crow bar, actor Joshua Jackson joked, \\"Finally I'm going to get a little respect on this set.\\" Mark Valley returns as John Scott. The actor stated that despite the character's death in the pilot; \\"I'm going to be showing up in the first season. And, for a guy who died in the pilot, I consider myself pretty fortunate.\\" Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Joseph Meegar, Max Baker as Jacob Fischer, and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar. The first season DVD contains a deleted scene of Olivia and Peter picking up the homing pigeons from a friend of his named Tony. Tony quietly mentions to Peter that his sister could use Peter's help, but when asked, Peter refuses to tell Olivia more of the story. ReceptionRatings= \\"Power Hungry\\" first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 14, 2008. It was watched by 9.157 million viewers, Fox's second highest rated show for the week. It also earned a 4.2/10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 4.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. With time shifted ratings taken into account, viewership rose to 11.05 million seven days after original broadcast. =Reviews= Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10, stating that although it was \\"perfectly serviceable, professionally produced television,\\" it was \\"much like the last week with a little bit of been-there-done-that conspiracy stuff thrown on top of it,\\" and that the plot was \\"almost boilerplate for this genre.\\" By this point in the series, the reviewer believed that \\"the thing about Fringe that is holding it back is that you're always ahead of it. The show needs to change things up.\\" Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha, opined; \\"Though not the show's best hour to date, 'Power Hungry' is still a solid entry. Good directing, writing, and outstanding production values are maintained as the series' norm.\\" In addition Griffin enjoyed Fischer's \\"casual surrender\\", as \\"in the past, those associated with 'the pattern' exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture, going as far as committing suicide. What's this guy's deal? He obviously has a plan.\\" However the reviewer was skeptical as to why Astrid was comfortable working with Walter again, considering he subdued her in the previous episode. Los Angeles Times reviewer Patrick Kevin Day stated that at this point in the series, he \\"initially fretted that Fringe would never grow beyond a run-of-the-mill \\"X-Files\\" knock-off,\\" but now saw the creators' intentions. Sarah Stegall of SFScope called the episode an homage to X-Files episode \\"D.P.O.\\", whose featured character has a similar premise to Meegar. Stegall admitted that \\"this show is growing on me,\\" with the same atmosphere as The X-Files \\"coupled with a slightly better grounding in actual science.\\" Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend reacted positively towards the episode, commending it as it \\"bounced back so quickly from that lame silver cylinder episode or they would've lost me forever.\\" Dougherty also felt that the three protagonists, Olivia, Walter and Peter, \\"are becoming much more believable characters.\\" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B‚àí, opining that the cold open was the series' best since the pilot, but added that \\"despite the added [Freak of the Week] sympathy, 'Power Hungry' promptly peters out, because the level of oddity required for Walter and the Pattern Team to track the Freak down isn't especially high.\\" Murray added that the return of Scott and his scenes with Olivia \\"serves to string along the home viewer, inviting us to question whether Olivia's playing for the right team in this whole Pattern game.\\" Television Without Pity meanwhile, graded the episode with an A‚àí.

With a wide spectrum of colors in her palette, including dark and evocative harmonies, earthy Brazilian rhythms, bright Afro-Cuban influences, and the smoky tones of jazz, Herrera paints an enchanting picture. The instrumentation is warm and acoustic, with a seductive organic quality, and consistently top-notch. The Mexican songstress herself has a husky, emotive sound that draws the listener in close enough to whisper. Her melodic sense and sensitivity make up for her evident lack of raw power. She commands attention at simmering intensity; there is no need to boil over. Though the production team is made up of virtual unknowns, and Herrera is a newcomer herself, few would guess as much when hearing the record. There is a maturity and taste present that defy the cast's lack of experience. Seldom comes along an international debut as subtle and intelligent.

Charter Communications, Inc., 936 F.2d 692 (2d Cir. 1991), is a U.S. federal court case. A contract case, it discusses the impropriety of punitive damages and favoring the theory of efficient breach. Case procedure and summary U.S. Naval Institute, as the assignee for the book The Hunt for Red October, sued Charter Communications and Berkley Publishing Group for breach of a licensing contract. The contract was an exclusive license to publish a paperback edition of the book, not sooner than October 1985. The publishers breached this contract by initiating retail sales on September 15, 1985. Early sales were substantial enough to put the book near the top of paperback best seller lists before the end of September. Naval lost its suit for a preliminary injunction to prevent these sales. The District Court ruled that Berkeley had not breached the contract, because it was to ship before the agreed publication date, which was industry custom. However, the Circuit court reversed this holding and determined that the contract was breached. On remand, the trial court concluded that the damages Naval was entitled to not merely actual damages for copyright infringement, but also recovery of profits wrongfully received by Berkeley (in the month of September) for that infringement. Holding No. Damages for breach of contract are supposed to compensate the injured party for the loss caused by the breach. Those are measured by the plaintiff's actual loss. *While defendant's profits are on occasion used to measure damages, this generally occurs when those profits help to define the plaintiff's loss. The object behind contract remedies is to compensate, not to punish. Punitive damages are only recoverable from a breach of contract if the conduct that constitutes the breach is also a tort [Subsection 355, Restatement (Second) of Contracts].

The concept has been used by fertility clinics to explain the fertility problems, recurrent miscarriages and pregnancy complications observed when this state of immunological tolerance is not successfully achieved. Immunological therapy is the new up and coming method for treating many cases of previously \\"unexplained infertility\\" or recurrent miscarriage.Pearson, H. Immunity‚Äôs Pregnant Pause. Nature Publishing Group.2002; 420: 265-266. Between mother and fetus The fact that the embryo's tissue is half foreign and unlike mismatched organ transplant, it is not normally rejected, suggests that the immunological system of the mother plays an important role in pregnancy. The placenta also plays an important part in protecting the embryo for the immune attack from the mother's system. Studies also propose that proteins in semen may help woman‚Äôs immune system prepare for conception and pregnancy. For example, there is substantial evidence for exposure to partner's semen as prevention for pre-eclampsia, largely due to the absorption of several immune modulating factors present in seminal fluid, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFŒ≤). = Maternal Immune System Changes = The maternal immune system, specifically within the uterus, makes some changes in order to allow for implantation and protect a pregnancy from attack. One of these changes are to the uterine natural killer (uNK) cells. NK cells, part of the innate immune system, are cytotoxic and responsible for attacking pathogens and infected cells. However, the number and type of receptors the uNK cells contain during a healthy pregnancy differs compared to an abnormal pregnancy Acar, N., Ustunel, I., & Demir, R. (2011). Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their missions during pregnancy: A review. Acta Histochemica, 113(2), 82‚Äì91. doi: 10.1016/j.acthis.2009.12.001. Despite the fetus containing foreign paternal antigens, uNK cells do not recognize it as ‚Äúnon-self‚Äù Acar, N., Ustunel, I., & Demir, R. (2011).

Therefore, the cytotoxic effects of the uNK cells do not target the developing fetus Acar, N., Ustunel, I., & Demir, R. (2011). Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their missions during pregnancy: A review. Acta Histochemica, 113(2), 82‚Äì91. doi: 10.1016/j.acthis.2009.12.001. This provides evidence of fetal-maternal communication regarding immune response during pregnancy. Sperm cells within a male The presence of anti-sperm antibodies in infertile men was first reported in 1954 by Rumke and Wilson. It has been noticed that the number of cases of sperm autoimmunity is higher in the infertile population leading to the idea that autoimmunity could be a cause of infertility. Anti sperm antigen has been described as three immunoglobulin isotopes (IgG, IgA, IgM) each of which targets different part of the spermatozoa. If more than 10% of the sperm are bound to anti-sperm antibodies (ASA), then infertility is suspected. The blood-testis barrier separates the immune system and the developing spermatozoa. The tight junction between the Sertoli cells form the blood- testis barrier but it is usually breached by physiological leakage. Not all sperms are protected by the barrier because spermatogonia and early spermatocytes are located below the junction. They are protected by other means like immunologic tolerance and immunomodulation. Infertility after anti- sperm antibody binding can be caused by autoagglutination, sperm cytotoxicity, blockage of sperm-ovum interaction, and inadequate motility. Each presents itself depending on the binding site of ASA.  Immunocontraceptive vaccine  Experiments are undergoing to test the effectiveness of an immunocontraceptive vaccine that inhibits the fusing of spermatozoa to the zona pellucida. This vaccine is currently being tested in animals and hopefully will be an effective contraceptive for humans. Normally, spermatozoa fuse with the zona pellucida surrounding the mature oocyte; the resulting acrosome reaction breaks down the egg's tough coating so that the sperm can fertilize the ovum. The mechanism of the vaccine is injection with cloned ZP cDNA, therefore this vaccine is a DNA based vaccine. This results in the production of antibodies against the ZP, which stop the sperm from binding to the zona pellucida and ultimately from fertilizing the ovum.Markert U. Immunology of gametes and embryo implantation. Switzerland: Karger; 2005. Another vaccine in investigation is one against HCG. This immunization would produce antibodies against hCG and TT. Antibodies against hCG would prevent the maintenance of the uterus for a viable pregnancy therefore preventing conception. Another vaccine that is utilized is the peptide Œ≤-hCG that is more specific to hCG and a more rapid and effective response occurs in the absence of LH, FSH, and TSH.

Pathophysiology Vaccinia is introduced into the skin by means of multiple punctures of a bifurcated needle. The virus replicates in the basal layer and disseminates from cell to cell, causing necrosis and the formation of fluid- filled vesicles. Nonetheless, the initial spread of virus is slowed by innate antiviral mechanisms, and, by the second week, the cell-mediated immune response begins to eliminate infected cells. Neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes infiltrate the inoculation site, forming a confluent pustule and releasing cytokines and chemokines that cause hyperemia and edema in surrounding tissues. This may initially manifest into complaints of malaise and other mild constitutional symptoms, fever, vomiting and tender, enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Some vaccinees develop additional local ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù pustules that resolve along with the primary lesion. The virus may gain access to the blood at an early stage, and secondary skin lesions, which follow the same evolution as the inoculation site, may appear across the body. Bacteria, like Staphylococcus aureus, may infect the ulcerated, and necrotic lesions. Coalescent lesions may cover large portions of the body with extensive tissue destruction. Although some vaccinia viruses commonly disseminate through the bloodstream, the NYCBOH strain reportedly causes only limited viremia in a small percentage of recipients during the period of pustule formation Fenner F, Henderson DA, Arita I, Jezek Z, Ladnyi I. , Smallpox and its eradication, 1988GenevaWorld Health Organization Blattner RJ, Normal JO, Heys FM, Aksu I.

The inflammatory process reaches its peak by days 10‚Äì12 after vaccination and begins to resolve by day 14, with shedding of the scab and other pustules by day 21.

Immunologic responses to vaccinia vaccines administered by different parenteral routes, J Infect Dis, 1997, vol. 175 (pg. 756-63). Complications Opportunistic fungal, protozoal, or bacterial infections and the vaccinia virus itself may lead to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation, in addition to necrosis and ulcerated skin tissue. Some of these tissue may eventually become large, requiring not only a skin graft, but surgical removal of the destroyed tissue, in order to avoid Graft-versus-host disease in organ transplanted patients, in whom immunosuppressive therapy would otherwise have to be discontinued to allow healing of the wound. Treatment In addition to a skin graft, some medications also work. Among antiviral substances, cidofovir showed some effect in preliminary studies. Apart from treating opportunistic infections with anti-viral and antibiotic medications, for HIV or immunocompromised (or at the very least iatrogenic immunosuppression like cancer and autoimmune disease) people, immediate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV patients and withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy accompanied by aggressive administration of VIG are mandatory to save the patient's life. Intensive care and supportive treatment are required. VIG is given at up to 10 ml / kg body weight.

With Natural Gas Choice programs, customers can either purchase from their natural gas utility or choose to receive their gas supply from non-utility Choice suppliers. Large commercial and industrial consumers have had the option of purchasing the natural gas commodity separately from natural gas services for many years. Natural Gas ChoiceOverview= Currently, 21 States and the District of Columbia have legislation or existing programs that allow Natural Gas Choice Programs. Enrollment in ‚Äúcustomer choice‚Äù programs increased in 2008 for the third year in a row. Overall, more than 13 percent or about 4.7 million of the approximately 35 million residential natural gas consumers with access to choice were buying natural gas from marketers as of December 2008. The availability and characteristics of these customer choice programs vary widely from state to state. For instance, some states allow customers to participate in Choice programs, but lack of natural gas supplier participation has precluded the development of a competitive natural gas market. Even in fully developed competitive markets enrollment varies widely. Currently the states of Georgia and Ohio have the highest percentage of customer participation in Natural Gas Choice programs with 81.5 percent and 42.3 percent of customers participating in Natural Gas Choice Programs respectively. New York and New Jersey, on the other hand, have customer participation rates of 17.1 percent and 3.1 percent respectively, despite full implementation of Natural Gas Choice Programs. One reason for the disparity between participation rates is the difficulty marketers in some states have obtaining financing to purchase natural gas for delivery. Whereas in Georgia, the overwhelming majority of customers are served by one large marketer, Georgia Natural Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the regulated utility, Atlanta Gas Light Company. New York State is served by 69 mostly independent marketers. =Georgia= Georgia is the state with the highest participation percentage in Natural Gas Choice programs. In 1999 all Georgia customers became eligible to participate in Natural Gas Choice. At one time 19 natural gas suppliers were approved to supply gas to natural gas customers. However, by 2002, 90% of Georgia residents were served by 3 or fewer marketers. In 2007, Georgia had 1,793,650 residential and 127,835 commercial customers. They consumed approximately 112 and 49 billion cubic feet of natural gas, respectively. =Ohio= Ohio has had Natural Gas Choice since 1997. More than 40 percent of the state's residential natural gas customers were participating in choice programs as of September 2008. Several major Ohio natural gas utilities in Ohio have plans to exit the function of supplying natural gas to customers, leaving the gas supply function to independent natural gas supply companies. In 2007, Ohio had 3,273,791 residential, 272,548 commercial, and 6,865 industrial customers. They consumed approximately 300, 159, and 295 billion cubic feet of natural gas, respectively. Currently, Ohio has 35 natural gas suppliers certified to participate in Natural Gas Choice programs.

Created by Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang, the character first appeared in Wonder Woman vol. 4 #13 (Dec. 2012). A dark secret held by the elder Gods of Olympus, the First Born was in fact the first born child of Zeus and Hera. On the day of his birth, a prophecy was recited that some day he would sit upon the throne of his father with the rest of the family as corpses around him. To prevent this from coming to pass, Zeus arranged for his infant son's death, but it survived; using its nascent power, it commandeered a pack of hyenas to bring it food. It grew to adulthood, and became strong. For thousands of years the First Born has walked the Earth, trying to earn the love and respect of his distant father while also seeking ways to destroy him. Fictional character biography A grotesque and enormous man with cannibalistic tendencies and a muscular body entirely covered in scars, the First Born emerged from ice in Antarctica soon after the God Apollo took over the throne of Olympus, and was soon approached by a group of scientists who were waiting for him to appear. He devoured one of them and started talking with normal human words, after he first only spoke in a strange mysterious language. He claimed to be \\"the one with no name, the crippler of souls, the First Born\\", and refused the group attempt to \\"help him\\". Subsequent issues later revealed him to be the first born son of Zeus and Hera of Olympus, in a time before recorded history. On the day of his birth, Zeus had a witch foretell the infant's future. She predicted that Mount Olympus would have been under his sole absolute control, with death and destruction in his wake. As Zeus himself had vanquished his father, and like his father before him, Zeus feared he would share their fate and ordered the witch to kill the infant in spite of Hera's protests. Seeing Hera's desperation, the witch took pity on the infant, and rather than kill him as ordered, she decided to spare his life and only abandoned him on the African plains with a slim chance to survive. Instead of being savaged by the beasts of the plains, the First Born was taken in and raised by a pack of hyenas. Despite never meeting any humans before he reached manhood, the First Born instinctively knew he was the son of Zeus and he spent his days attempting to gain his attention without success by performing feats of strength and savagery. Having grown to manhood and realized he would never gain the attention of Zeus from the plains, he set his sights on the emerging human world. Together with his pack he created an army of Hyena-men and invaded the human lands with it, eventually coming to control it all, ruling over a barbaric kingdom. Yet still, despite this feat, and what other monsters he threw himself at, Zeus still refused to answer. Finally, the First Born decided that if Zeus would not come to him, he would go to Zeus and lay siege to Mount Olympus itself. He gathered his army before marching it to every corner of his kingdom, demanding two things: join him or die. At last when his army stood before Mount Olympus, the First Born challenged his father and threw a spear at the mountain. In response, Zeus sent a tidal wave that crushed the First Born's army and left the son half drowned. Zeus finally appeared in person before the First Born and condemned him, letting the Earth swallow him, dragging him into its core. After this, only five people knew of the First Born had ever existed: Zeus, Hera who thought him dead, Poseidon who commanded the wave, Hades who received the First Born's army and the witch, who would chronicle the events on her own skin. Ever since then, the First Born has been clawing his way out of the Earth, which took over seven thousand years. All knowledge of his existence has been erased from history by Zeus, the only account of his story was tattooed across the mummified body of the witch that spared him. The tale had taken most of the lead scientist Cassandra's life, as the body was discovered 80 years ago, and recounted the infant First Born's life story. Since his re-discovery, the First Born first collected his arms and armor, made of a dragon's hide and bones. Then he bargained for his army with Hades and Poseidon, who would be left alone in return along with the death of the Last Born: Zeke. Wonder Woman and her allies, following an encounter with the goddess Artemis, were unprepared for an encounter with the First Born. They gained the opportunity to flee to New Genesis after Diana's half-brother Lennox sacrificed himself in order to buy the others time. With no way of following them, the First Born laid claim to London and waited 3 days before Diana and her allies would return, only to be defeated at the combined hands of Wonder Woman, Orion and Ares, leaving Ares dead and Diana the new God of War. Apollo claimed the First Born and attempted to torture him into obedience, only for him to eventually break free and claim Mount Olympus as his own. With his father's throne, the First Born has since been on a campaign to slay the other Olympians, having killed Hades and fed him to Chronos and nearly killed Demeter. He would eventually be poised to invade Themyscira, the homeland of the only one he appears to have some semblance of grudging respect; Wonder Woman, who had defeated him in the past. Powers and abilities As an Olympian god, the First Born possesses sufficient superhuman strength, speed and invulnerability to challenge the likes of Wonder Woman and Orion of the New Gods,Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #21 and to strangle Ares (once, Greek god of 'War') to death.Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #23 In one battle, after surviving blows from Orion and Wonder Woman, he was able to pry open a Boom Tube, with his bare hands (a first for the DC Comics Universe), and hold it open for an extended period of time. Despite his extraordinary physical power, First Born uses his divine genius to manipulate or control lesser beings, like his hyena-men, preferring only to engage in direct confrontations with equals or other gods, like Wonder Woman (daughter of Zeus) and the dragon that he slew to get his mystical armor and weapons, which make him seemingly invulnerable to mortal harm. Without his armor, he is impervious enough to crawl through the Earth's crust,Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #23.2 unaffected by the heat and immense pressure, and enough to survive a shotgun blast to the head. Among the First Born's array of godly powers is his telepathic ability to communicate with wildlife, and especially his hyena companions, some of whom he mated with to create his ferocious were-hyena soldiers. He has also displayed his telepathic abilities by sensing the berserker rage in Wonder Woman and goading her into a fight with him. Upon briefly becoming the King of the Greek gods and of oblivion, the First Born went into battle with the Amazons, naked, in a crown of severed deer antlers and a cloak of dismembered, bloody veins that, at his command, could ensnare his opponents and drain away their life forces. He also had psychokinetic control over the energy and matter of Mount Olympus to transfigure it into a mound of bloody, organic flesh, with giant bones jutting up through it, into the sky.Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #34 References Category:Characters created by Brian Azzarello Category:Comics characters introduced in 2012 Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Wonder Woman characters ","title":"First Born (comics)"},{"id":"22827480","text":"Michael Turner (born 1934) is a British illustrator who specialises in motoring and aviation paintings. He is regarded as one of the early examples of such type and is one of the most highly regarded of all. Turner counts racing drivers, teams, sponsors, pilots, motor and aircraft manufacturers, R.A.F. (Royal Air Force) and Army messes, museums and private collections as his client lists and has hosted a number of solo shows all over the world, plus other specialist shows. Biography Turner was born and raised within the suburbs of Harrow, Middlesex. During the Second World War, he became interested in aviation and aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force and drew aircraft in his school exercise books which infuriated his teachers. After the war, Turner developed an interest in motoring and motorsport when during his family holiday to the Isle of Man in 1947, they attended the British Empire Trophy Race. After leaving school, Turner attended an art college, followed by national service with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for two years. His first job after national service was with a London advertising studio and he turned freelance in 1957. Turner's artworks were shown regularly on the wall of the renowned Steering Wheel Club in London and many of these illustrations appeared on magazine and book covers. In the 1960s, Turner started up his own company, 'Studio 88', to publish his aviation and motor racing prints, as well as his annual set of Christmas Cards that became popular with enthusiasts. He was commissioned by organisers to create official posters for notable motorsport events such as 24 hours of Le Mans, 12 hours of Sebring, a number of Formula One races and many others that took place in notable circuits such as N√ºrburgring. He was notable in the United States for his poster works for races that took places in Watkins Glen between 1969 and 1980 and also created posters for its United States Grand Prix East races. With a need to capture the genuine nature of being in an event, Turner tends to travel to as many motorsport and aviation events as he could where he commonly sketches at events he attends for reference reasons. Turner was also involved with the Can-Am series and had close ties with the McLaren team, which he became friends with its drivers, Denny Hulme and Bruce McLaren. He was responsible of the design of the bodywork of the race winning McLaren M1B and designed the team logo as well as designing the colour scheme for its first Formula One car of the 1966 season. That colour scheme was short lived as prior to the Monaco Grand Prix, the car's livery had to be changed when it was chosen by the producers of the film Grand Prix to be the lead car of the 'Yamura' team, driven by its lead character, Pete Aron (played by James Garner), the colour scheme was changed to team's white and blue, resembling that of Honda. He is a founder member of The Guild of Aviation Artists, of which he has been Chairman on two occasions and is currently President, and is also an Honorary Fellow of the Guild of Motoring Artists. Turner has been involved with the Red Arrows, and has flown with them in the past. He counts racing drivers, teams, sponsors, pilots, motor and aircraft manufacturers, R.A.F. and Army messes, museums and private collections in his client list and has hosted a number of solo shows all over the world, plus other specialist shows. His artwork has also appeared on the packaging of Airfix models. Turner has had, to this date, six books of his works published. Personal life Turner has been married to Helen since 1960. They have two daughters, Alison and Suzanne. His son, Graham, is also an artist and they continue to visit several Grands Prix each year. Turner is licensed to fly a private aircraft, and flies his privately owned Chipmunk aircraft in his spare time. Michael and his son have held exhibitions of their artworks at Halton House in 2005 and 2006.

Stanton. 119th Aviation Company During the Vietnam War, one of the units that became part of the 52d Aviation Battalion (Combat), 17th Aviation Group (Combat) was the 119th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter). The company operated throughout the Central Highlands of Vietnam during the war, from arrival in September 1962 until inactivation in November 1970. Originally designated the 81st Transportation Company and equipped with twin-rotor CH-21 \\"Flying Banana\\" piston-engined helicopters, the company arrived in Pleiku, Vietnam, on 17 September 1962. On 25 June 1963 its assets were used to form the 119th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter)(Airmobile), and it was re-equipped with turbine-powered single-rotor UH-1A and UH1-B Hueys. The company's area of operations included the entire Central Highlands of Vietnam, plus large portions of Laos and Cambodia. Eventually assigned to the 52d Aviation Battalion (Combat), 17th Aviation Group (Combat), 1st Aviation Brigade and headquartered at Camp Holloway in Pleiku, the 119th was also based at An Khe for a short time later in the war. The helicopters were equipped with 16 to 20 lightly armed UH-1Ds (or UH-1H model \\"Slick\\" troopships that used the radio callsign called \\"Alligator\\" or \\"Gator\\"), and approximately 8 Huey UH-1C model gunships known as \\"Crocodiles\\" or \\"Crocs.\\" The company at one time also used the callsign called \\"Black Dragon\\" from which the 52d's \\"Flying Dragon\\" callsign evolved. The total company strength of approximately 225 included 50 to 60 pilots and an equal number of crewmembers, plus field maintenance and other critical support personnel. During over eight years in Vietnam, the 119th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter) provided helicopter support for the US Army 4th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 173d Airborne Brigade, US Marine Corps, United States Army Special Forces and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. They also flew many classified missions for MACV-SOG. Over 60 members of the 119th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter) were killed in action, with many more wounded. As the war in Vietnam wound down, the 17th Aviation Group was inactivated in Oakland, California, on 16 March 1973. Chinook heavy lift chopper in action Korea and Inactivation The 17th was reactivated in Korea on 1 June 1975. In Korea the group continued its logistics and combat aviation role in support of the US Forces Korea (USFK), ROK-US Combined Forces Command (CFC), and Eighth United States Army (EUSA). Equipment assets included UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, CH-47 Chinook heavy lift choppers, and C-12 Huron fixed-wing aircraft. In Korea the 17th received air traffic control from the 164th Air Traffic Services Group, which provided ATC services throughout the entire Korean theater in support of all Army aviation operations. On 17 October 1987 the group was redesignated as the 17th Aviation Brigade. As a brigade, it was authorized its own shoulder sleeve insignia, which became authorized on 9 June 1988, And Was Designed by CSM Jerry O Knapp As part of the overall restructuring of Army forces, in June 2005 the brigade was inactivated, along with the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat), and most of the assets of both brigades were merged into the Combat Aviation Brigade, 2d Infantry Division in Korea, although some aircraft were reallocated to units in Alaska and Hawaii. At the time of the 17th's inactivation it had one of the last pathfinder units in the entire US Army, the other being assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, KY. The last pathfinder commander was Captain Derek Martin and the last pathfinder Team Leader was SSG Donald Jordan.

The service ran for 111 years between 1884 and 1995. The rails were removed in October 1997. History The railway was originally incorporated as Gananoque & Rideau Railway on 15 February 1871, but construction did not begin until 1883 due to lack of money. The town provided tax breaks and $10,000 in debenture financing to Rathbun's Bay of Quinte Railway and Navigation Company to build the line; that company already operated steamship docks in the village. The original line opened 1 January 1884. The company name was changed to Thousand Islands Railway four months later. A swing bridge over the mouth of the Gananoque River was constructed in 1894 to provide service to businesses on the east side of the river. The line originally served to carry timber and freight to Gananoque's docks, where it could be loaded onto ships. While available timber stocks soon diminished, passenger traffic increased as the Grand Trunk under Charles Melville Hays promoted the tiny town as a vacation destination.http://cnr-in- ontario.com/Reports/RSR-212.html The original junction between the Thousand Island Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway was moved east in 1902 to a flatter location. A 1947 map of the Gananoque terminal shows a nine-switch track arrangement, a coal/wood yard, a coal dealer, a number company, a mill, the Cow and Gate dairy, a two-stall engine house, passenger station and freight/express building.\\"By road, rail and water to Gananoque\\", Douglas N.W. Smith, 120 pages (out of print) The Thousand Islands Railway was merged into the Canadian National Railway in 1958. Passenger service ended in 1962; freight service ended in 1995. The line was dismantled in 1997. What remains today The unique locomotive #500 is preserved at Sculpture Park, where King Street crosses the Gananoque River. The waterfront station became a restaurant after passenger service ended, but was destroyed by fire in 1990; the Arthur Child Heritage Museum was built on the site. The former right-of-way is readily visible on satellite imagery, and is now a hiking trail. The Gananoque Junction station remains on Station Road which is west of Hiscocks Road.

Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) is an enterprise modelling methodology for transaction modelling, and analysing and representing business processes. It is developed since the 1980s by Jan Dietz and others, and is inspired by the language/action perspectiveJan L.G. Dietz (1999). \\"DEMO : towards a discipline of Organisation Engineering\\" In: European Journal of Operational Research, 1999.  Overview  DEMO is a methodology for designing, organizing and linking organizations. Central concept is the \\"communicative action\\": communication is considered essential for the functioning of organizations. Agreements between employees, customers and suppliers are indeed created to communicate. The same is true for the acceptance of the results supplied.Enterprise Engineering Institute. Accessed November 21, 2008. The DEMO methodology is based on the following principles:Jan Dietz (1996) Introductie tot DEMO . Accessed April 2, 2013. * The essence of an organization is that it consists of people with authority and responsibility to act and negotiate. * The modeling of business processes and information systems is a rational activity, which leads to uniformity. * Models should be understandable for all concerned. * Information should 'fit' with their users. The DEMO methodology provides a coherent understanding of communication, information, action and organization. The scope is here shifted from \\"Information Systems Engineering\\" to \\"Business Systems Engineering\\", with a clear understanding of both the information and the central organizations.  History  The DEMO methodology is inspired on the language/action perspective, which was initially developed as a philosophy of language by J. L. Austin, John Searle and J√ºrgen Habermas and was built on the speech act theory. The language/action perspective was introduced in the field of computer science and information systems design by Fernando Flores and Terry Winograd in the 1980s.Flores, F., Graves, M., Hartfield, B., & Winograd, T. (1988). \\"Computer systems and the design of organizational interaction .\\" ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 6(2), 153-172. According to Dignum and Dietz (1997) this concept has \\"proven to be a new basic paradigm for Information Systems Design. In contrast to traditional views of data flow, the language/action perspective emphasizes what people do while communicating, how they create a common reality by means of language, and how communication brings about a coordination of their activities.\\"Frank Dignum, Jan Dietz editors. (1997) Communication Modeling, The Language/Action Perspective. Second International Workshop on Communication Modeling (LAP'97) Veldhoven, The Netherlands, JUNE 9-10 1997 Working Papers. DEMO is developed at the Delft University of Technology by Jan Dietz in the early 1990s, and originally stood for \\"Dynamic Essential Modelling of Organizations\\". It builds on the Language Action Perspective (LAP), which is derived from the work include John Austin, John Searle and J√ºrgen Habermas since the 1960s. It is linked to the \\"Natural language Information Analysis Method\\" (NIAM) developed by Shir Nijssen,Rob Aaldijk en Erik Vermeulen (2001).

In the 1990s the name was changed to \\"Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations\\". In the new millennium Jan Dietz further elaborated DEMO into \\"enterprise ontology\\", in which the graphic note of object-role modeling is integrated.Jan L.G. Dietz (2006). Enterprise Ontology - Theory and Methodology, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. p.46. These concepts were also developed by Dietz and others into a framework for enterprise architecture, entitled Architecture Framework (XAF).Jan Dietz (2008). Architecture - Building strategy into design. Academic Service. In the new millennium the French company Sogeti developed a methodology based on the DEMO, called Pronto. The further development of DEMO is supported by the international Enterprise Engineering Institute, based in Delft in The Netherlands.Enterprise Engineering Institute  DEMO, topics  Pattern of a business transaction = In DEMO the basic pattern of a business transaction is composed of the following three phases:Kecheng Liu (2001). Information, Organisation, and Technology: Studies in Organisational Semiotics. pp.198-2002. * An actagenic phase during which a client requests a fact from the supplier agent. * The action execution which will generate the required fact * A factagenic phase, which leads the client to accept the results reported Basic transactions can be composed to account for complex transactions. The DEMO methodology gives the analyst an understanding of the business processes of the organization, as well as the agents involved, but is less clear about pragmatics aspects of the transaction, such as the conversation structure and the intentions generated in each agents mind. = Abstraction levels = DEMO assumes that an organization consists of three integrated layers:Jan L.G. Dietz (2006). Enterprise Ontology - Theory and Methodology, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. p.118.Jan L.G. Dietz (2008). Architecture : Building strategy into design. Academic Service. p.32 * B-organization, * I-organization and * D-organization. The B-organization or business layer according to DEMO is the essence of the organization, regardless of the device is possible there. Understanding the business layer is the right starting point in setting up an organization, including the software to support business processes. This vision leads to a division into three perspectives or levels of abstraction: * Essential: business system or the B system * Informational: either the information I system * Documenteel: data system either D system At each level has its own category of systems at that level \\"active\\": there are so B systems (of company and business), I-systems (of informational and information) and D systems (from documenteel and data) . The main focus in DEMO is focused on the critical level, the other two are, therefore, less discussed in detail. = The ontological model of an organization = The ontological model of an organisation in DEMO-3 consists of the integrated whole of four aspect models, each taking a specific view on the organisation: * Construction Model (CM) * Process Model (PM) * Action Model (AM), and * Fact Model (FM) There are two ways of representing these aspect models: graphically, in diagrams and tables, and textually, in DEMOSL. Construction Model The Construction Model (CM) of an organisation is the ontological model of its construction: the composition (the internal actor roles, i.e. the actor roles within the border of the organisation), the environment (i.e. the actor roles outside the border of the organisation that have interaction with internal actor roles), the interaction structure (i.e. the transaction kinds between the actor roles in the composition, and between these and the actor roles in the environment), and the interstriction structure (i.e. the information links from actor roles in the composition to internal transaction kinds and to external transaction kinds). The CM of an organisation is represented in an Organisation Construction Diagram (OCD), a Transaction Product Table (TPT), and a Bank Contents Table (BCT). Process Model The Process Model (PM) of an organisation is the ontological model of the state space and the transition space of its coordination world. Regarding the state space, the PM contains, for all internal and border transaction kinds, the process steps and the existence laws that apply, according to the complete transaction pattern. Regarding the transition space, the PM contains the coordination event kinds as well as the applicable occurrence laws, including the cardinalities of the occurrences. The occurrence laws within a transaction process are fully determined by the complete transaction pattern. Therefore, a PSD contains only the occurrence laws between transaction processes, expressed in links between process steps. There are two kinds: response links and waiting links. A PM is represented in a Process Structure Diagram (PSD), and a Transaction Pattern Diagram (TPD) for each transaction kind. In these diagrams it is indicated which ‚Äòexceptions‚Äô will be dealt with. Action Model The Action Model (AM) of an organisation consists of a set of action rules. There is an action rule for every agendum kind for every internal actor role. The agendum kinds are determined by the TPDs of the identified transaction kinds (see PM). An action rule consists of an event part (the event(s) to respond to), an assess part (the facts to be inspected), and a response part (the act(s) to be performed. An AM is represented in Action Rule Specifications (ARS) and Work Instruction Specifications (WIS). Fact Model The Fact Model (FM) of an organisation is the ontological model of the state space and the transition space of its production world. Regarding the state space, the FM contains all identified fact kinds (both declared and derived), and the existence laws. Three kinds of existence laws are specified graphically: reference laws, unicity laws, and dependency laws; the other ones are specified textually. Regarding the transition space, the FM contains the production event kinds (results of transactions) as well as the applicable occurrence laws. The transition space of the production world is completely determined by the transition space of its coordination world. Yet it may be illustrative to show the implied occurrence laws in an OFD. The FM is represented in an Object Fact Diagram (OFD), possibly complemented by Derived Fact Specifications and Existence Law Specifications. = Operation principle = If somebody (a person) wants to ensure that someone else creates a desired result then he or she starts a communication with a request. The person responsible for the results, can respond with a promise. Some time later, when work was done (the execution has taken place), he/she can state that the desired result is achieved. If this result is accepted by the person who had asked for the result then this is a fact. The pattern described in the communication between two people is called a DEMO transaction. A chain of transactions is called in DEMO a business process. Diagram of the principle of a DEMO transaction between two actors, with the result in between. The result of a transaction can be specified in DEMO as a facttype, using object-role modeling ( ORM ).  Support tools  The Dutch company Essmod the \\"Essential Business Modeler\\" tool developed based on DEMO, which was acquired in 2008 by Mprise after which it renamed to Xemod. DEMO is also supported in the open source world with the architecture tool Open Modeling. There is also a free online modeling tool Model for World DEMO which can be in an online repository.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 26 January 1988. The character is portrayed as a gossiping busybody and spinster who occupies her time with the Presbyterian church. In her early appearances, she formed an alliance with Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) and, though she has conservative views, she is not malicious. After one year as Celia, Spence hoped that she would find romance and change her attire. Producers decided to implement change and added smart outfits to the character's wardrobe. Spence decided to leave the series in 1990 and Celia departed the same year. She has since reprised the role on four occasions. After carrying out missionary work in Africa she returned to Summer Bay in 2000, 2002 and 2005. In 2012, it was announced that Spence had agreed to return once again. Originally heralded as the chance for Celia to reconnect with her on-screen brother, Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher), it was later revealed that she was hiding a shameful secret. Character developmentCharacterisation= In the Home and Away Annual, Melanie J. Clayden wrote that Celia \\"loves to gossip and can be a real busybody\\". Celia \\"must be regarded\\" with sympathy because she is a \\"lonely spinster with nothing but the Presbyterian church to occupy her time\\".J Clayden 1989, p.38. In the Annual written by Kesta Desmond, she was described as the youngest sister of Alf Stewart, but \\"unlike him she has never married\\" which turned her into the \\"stereotypical spinster\\" and \\"keen church goer\\" with a \\"bitter life\\".Desmond 1990, p.10. In the book Home and Away Special Celia and her older sister Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) are described as being \\"two sides of a coin\\". Celia is \\"quiet and conservative\\", which contrasts with the \\"ruthless\\" Morag.Hopwood 1990, p.8. Andrew Mercado wrote in his book, Super Aussie Soaps, that she was a \\"prudish\\" character.Mercado 2004, p.255. She has also been described as a \\"bitter spinster\\" and the \\"town gossip\\". Celia was similarly described by the serial writing team as, \\"the town's busy-body spinster, bitter that love has passed her by and taking that bitterness out on the world.\\" She is a \\"major ally\\" to Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) and loves to gossip because it \\"helps fill her life\\". Despite these traits, there is \\"not a malicious bone in her body\\". In the book Home and Away: Behind the Scenes, Spence told James Oram that Celia is very different from the character she previously played on Prisoner. Unlike Vera Bennett, Celia is \\"very vulnerable\\".Oram 1989, p.111. Celia is involved a comedy storyline in which locals search for the Summer Bay bunyip. Spence said that her funniest night shoot occurred while filming Alf cooking bunyip burgers and Celia selling tea towels. She also revealed that there would some changes to her character. After one year in the series, Spence had hoped that Celia would find a man and dress better. Home and Away's writers then informed Spence that they would make those slight changes. She told Oram that \\"there's a touch of romance that will be wonderful for Celia and there will be a remarkable change in her appearance. Celia will be going on a shopping spree to buy some rather smart outfits.\\"Oram 1989, p.112. Other than Spence, Celia has been portrayed by Gilda Ferguson, Tatham Lennox, and Annie Buckley in flashback sequences. =Returns (2000-05)= In 1990, Spence decided to leave Home and Away and Celia was written out.Hayward 1991, p.147. Spence reprised her role as Celia in 2000 and 2002.Black 2012, p.49. In 2005, she returned for the serial's 4,000th episode based around Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) 60th birthday. During her time away, Celia had been working as a missionary in Africa. But after she was taken hostage, she returned to Summer Bay but left soon after. While two of her returns were brief, her 2002 return was a longer stint. As Andrea Black noted in Home and Away Official Collector‚Äôs Edition, her visit \\"started well but later fared no better\\". Celia subsequently decided to leave once again. =Return (2012)= In 2012, Spence's management announced that she had reprised her role and returned to Home and Away. Spence confirmed her return to the show during an interview with a TV Week writer. She revealed that she was currently filming her scenes. In 2012, production staff felt they needed to refocus on \\"core family issues\\" to make the characters closer to one another. Celia's return was pioneered around this need. Lucy Addario told a writer from Home and Away Official Collector‚Äôs Edition that \\"Ceila is returning, so that is a treat for long-time fans and it is nice to tell a story about Alf connecting with his sister who he hasn't seen for years.\\"Black 2012, p.129. It later was revealed that Celia would return for the wedding of Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) and Harvey Ryan (Marcus Graham). Celia had previously shared \\"a frosty relationship\\" with Roo. Celia is keen to meet Harvey but is left unimpressed by him. She causes trouble for the couple when she decides that Harvey is not good enough for Roo. Spence told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that, \\"Celia is absolutely supportive of Roo, but I don't believe she will ever think anyone is good enough for Roo. That means Harvey has his work cut out for him winning over Celia.\\" After Roo's wedding, Celia prepares to leave. Spence told a reporter from TV Week that \\"just as Celia is about to leave, there are tears and a confession that she can't go anywhere.\\" She reveals that a con man has stolen all of her money, but the reporter revealed that Celia's secret was \\"more shameful\\". Spence explained that Celia is not being entirely truthful with Alf because she is ashamed. Her character‚Äôs shame helped Spence understand the dishonesty. She concluded that her return had been a \\"pleasure\\" because of the chance to work with Meagher and having Morag and Colleen on-screen offered Celia familiarity. Spence has revealed that Celia will be on-screen \\"for a while\\" and she would be willing to reprise the role again. Storylines Celia is the younger sister of Summer Bay stalwart Alf. In her youth, she was engaged to Les Palmer (Graham Lancaster) but he was killed in the Vietnam War and Celia never married. She is first seen talking to Alf about his relationship with Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn). Celia is judgmental and something of a gossip but ultimately well- meaning. She supports former brother-in-law Donald's attempts to have mentally disabled resident Nico Pappas (Nicholas Papademetriou) sectioned but changes her mind quickly once Tom Fletcher (Roger Oakley) speaks to her. Celia unwittingly spreads the news that Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) has been raped. Seeing the hurt she has caused, Celia tries to apologise to Carly and Tom but neither is willing to listen. Ailsa gives her a packet of chewing gum and advises her to use it whenever she feels like gossiping. Alf and Ailsa try to set her up by inviting her and local police sergeant Bob Barnett (Robert Baxter) to dinner. Celia spends the night getting drunk and Barnett has to escort her home. Celia invites him to watch her play tennis but assures him she only wanted to be friends with him. A bemused Barnett tells her that he has only ever seen her that way. Celia's niece, Roo (Justine Clarke), falls pregnant and, believing Frank Morgan (Alex Papps) is the father, Celia tries to arrange for the pair to get married. Morag, Celia's sister, persuades Roo to admit Frank is not the father and Celia gives Roo a place to stay. Celia purchases the local store from Ailsa when she sells it. Her first act is to try to evict Frank and his friend, Narelle Smart (Amanda Newman-Phillips), from the flat above the store. Local doctor Philip Matheson (John Morris), a friend of the youngsters and fellow tenant, persuades Celia to give them a few months to move out. When Narelle is supportive towards Celia when her great- niece Martha (Burcin Kapkin) is kidnapped by her father, Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont), Celia decides not to evict her. Celia is shocked when she learns Frank's new wife Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson) is Morag's daughter from an affair with Donald and, thus, her niece. Celia unwittingly reveals the truth when reporter James Donahue (Richard Morgan) begins asking questions. Morag moves in with Celia at their parents' old house and she is annoyed but relieved when Morag moves out to the Blaxland mansion. The store is destroyed in an arson attack by Brian 'Dodge' Forbes (Kelly Dingwall), which results in Philip's death. Celia makes arrangements with former school counsellor Andrew Foley (Peter Bensley) to set up a youth advice centre in the back room of the Diner, but is disgusted when she learns Andrew is an alcoholic and he leaves town. She persuades Ailsa to let her try running it on her own but Carly, who recently had a drinking problem, pretends to be drunk to show Celia she would not know how to deal with someone with a genuine problem. Andrew returns sober and asks Celia to help by counseling Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) but she panics when Marilyn takes some sleeping tablets and thinks she has attempted suicide. Celia causes more turmoil when her nephew Duncan (Allana Ellis) suffers an allergic reaction to an old family christening gown she provides. Celia befriends Nigel Taggart (Gary Down), Morag's assistant, and he becomes her dance partner. She develops feelings for him but Nigel does not reciprocate; however, in order to let her down gently, he tells her he is going to reunite with his fianc√©. A spiteful Morag tells her the truth and Nigel sends her a letter of apology. Celia receives attention from Ian McTavish (Noel Trevarthen), a Scottish explorer searching for the legendary Summer Bay bunyip, but quickly ends their date when she suspect he is merely after local information. She buys Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Martin Dibble's (Craig Thomson) hot dog business and asks them to work for her. While showing potential buyers around Morag's house, Celia becomes convinced the place is haunted. Alf's niece Emma Jackson (Dannii Minogue) and her friends decide to have some fun with the idea, convincing Reverend Flowers (Philip Ross) that Celia has a drinking problem when she asks him to perform an exorcism. She ends up doing the job herself with some holy water just as two bemused potential buyers turn up. Andrew, Alf, and Celia get their revenge by interrupting a party the youngsters are holding at the house with a staged haunting. Celia's judgmental streak is present when she is the only person to believe that teacher Grant Mitchell (Craig McLachlan) has sexually molested his student, Vicki Baxter (Nana Coburn). Vicki's lies are exposed and Grant is cleared, forcing Celia to apologise to him. She then becomes involved in organizing African Awareness Week in the bay, persuading Alf, Ailsa, and Donald to assist her. Her efforts produce awkward results. She is embarrassed when some cardboard cut-outs of African women she ordered are topless and covers them with strategically placed towels. Problems escalate when Celia orders some documentary videos about Africa, which turn out to be porn video that she unwittingly rents out. Reverend Christopher Goodhope (Ron Becks) arrives in the Bay and Celia decides to become a missionary and joins him in Africa. Ten years later, Celia is taken hostage in Nigeria by rebels. Alf goes over in person to negotiate her release before taking her back with him. She quickly discovers Duncan (now played by Brendan McKensy) and his new friend Nick Smith (Chris Egan) getting into trouble and takes them to task. This results in someone (later revealed as Nick's mother Eve (Robyn Gibbes), who has recently been released from a mental institute) throwing stones at her but she is pleased when Duncan sticks up for her against Nick. She returns to Africa. Celia returns to the Bay briefly two years later for the town's 150th anniversary celebrations and again briefly in 2005 for Alf's 60th birthday. Seven years later, Celia returns for Roo's wedding. Celia tells Alf she has no home to return to because a man has conned her. She takes a job at the Diner but she annoys the owner Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). Harvey challenges Celia to a game of poker and he notices that she is an experienced player. Celia steals money from the caravan park and the Diner, but soon replaces it. Alf accuses Celia, who confesses to having a gambling addiction. She decides to attend a help group but Alf soon discovers she lied. Marilyn helps Celia and Alf reconcile and she contacts Celia's ex-boyfriend Sheldon Atkinson (Laurence Coy). He arrives and Celia gives him another chance but, when he wants to gamble again, she breaks up with him. Celia reveals that she needs to help others to occupy her time and prevent gambling. She lectures Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing) and Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) on public displays of affection. She changes her mind about Heath and advises him to ask Bianca to marry him. This causes trouble between them but Celia gives her old engagement ring to Heath to win Bianca back. Celia decides that she is better off helping others away from Summer Bay and leaves.

The film has been the source of critical analysis. Academics Jans B. Wager describes the film as retro-noir, while Keith Gandal defines it as a \\"slumming trauma\\". Cultural critics Henry Giroux and Imre Szeman assert that Fight Club focuses too much on consumerist culture as society's problem. Academic Robert von Dassanowsky describes Fight Club as an examination of European fascism. Genre classificationsRetro-noir= According to Jans B. Wager, Fight Club exhibits several film noir characteristics. The film's narrator is a white male protagonist who provides a subjective voice-over. He is involved in \\"an erotic triangle\\" with \\"a female object of desire\\" (Marla Singer) and a male antagonist (Tyler Durden), all of whom are white. The white masculinity in the film differs from noir films by focusing on the upper middle class instead of the lower middle class or the working class. Both of the narrator's counterparts are simultaneously like him and dangerous to him, and the plot takes place in \\"an urban, crumbling, criminal milieu\\". With these characteristics, Fight Club masquerades as neo-noir. It is instead best classified as a retro-noir since its presentation of gender roles is \\"diametrically opposed\\" to neo-noir films, which in contrast \\"allow their protagonists to survive, thrive, and commit or solve crimes, with and without male companionship or assistance\\". The films also present a \\"more organic\\" heterosexual coupling than Fight Club. The female character is introduced as a femme fatale, wearing a dress, hat, and sunglasses, smoking a cigarette, and possessing \\"voluptuous\\" red lips. Her presence, regardless of \\"action or agency\\", is meant to show that \\"she is the source of all the problems for the narrator\\". The femme fatale appearance at the beginning is replaced by a heroin chic appearance for the rest of the film. The male antagonist appears in direct response to the \\"intrusion\\" of this female object of desire, recalling how in some noir films, the femme fatale appearance is a catalyst to the everyman's entry into \\"a criminal and dangerous world\\". The female character is presented as \\"necessary but peripheral\\" since she is never fully aware of what is happening. Cultural critic Henry Giroux describes the nature of Marla Singer as \\"an ultra- conservative version of post-1960s femininity that signifies the antithesis of domestic security, comfort, and sexual passitivity\\". This brand of post- feminism ties into \\"commodities that call for and support constant body maintenance (femininity)\\". Marla Singer finds her commodities in others' laundry or thrift stores, so \\"she transgresses both through her sexual appetites and her flaunting of the consumption-oriented conventions of femininity\\". =Slumming trauma= Keith Gandal defines Fight Club as a \\"slumming trauma\\" in the sense that it falls between the genres of the sentimental slumming drama and the trauma film. Sentimental slumming dramas avoid \\"the sordid\\" and \\"degraded environment and social interactions\\". They contain \\"wholesome\\" heroes, who and whose counterparts usually have \\"young, beautiful faces and bodies\\" that do not bruise or do recover easily from bruising. Examples of sentimental slumming dramas include Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, and Forrest Gump. In contrast, trauma films have \\"a penchant for disfigurement and disease\\", and they exhibit \\"blasted\\" nihilism in which the films' characters are paralyzed by trauma and even become \\"traumatizers\\" themselves. Examples of trauma films include Gummo, Kids, and Welcome to the Dollhouse. While Fight Club expresses \\"radical\\" slumming notions through lines like, \\"Only when you've lost everything are you free to do anything,\\" the film is hostile to sentimental slumming. Gandal writes of the film's perception, \\"Sentimentalism is an insidious lie that denies the realities of human life and the human body as it promises a fairy-tale experience that doesn't exist.\\" Additionally, one of Fight Clubs main characters, Tyler Durden, advocates methods of \\"self-actualization and self-discovery\\", which are radical compared to those of \\"wholesome\\" heroes. While slumming dramas avoid physically degraded conditions, Fight Club embraces the conditions in a manner that \\"mystifies and romanticizes the sordid\\". This approach differentiates from trauma films' approach of these conditions. Instead of the characters being paralyzed by traumas, the traumas are \\"romantic\\" traumas that \\"shake people awake and remind them that they are alive and full of possibility\\". Through fight clubs, \\"the desecrated body is a central image in slumming trauma\\" with injuries being fetishes in the genre. The romanticism is a paradox in the slumming trauma genre; the characters identify with decay as \\"purifying\\" and identify with the degraded as \\"transcendent\\". The paradox is unstable; there are suggestions of \\"humiliation and self-loathing\\". The love object Marla Singer accuses the narrator of having \\"serious emotional problems\\", and there is anger among fight club members that they will not be \\"millionaires and movie gods and rock stars\\". The narrator discovers that celebrity treatment as leader of the fight clubs prompts the question of how the narrator cannot be special. Gandal elaborates on the double-sided nature that results from the paradox: \\"Either the narrator is discovering his aliveness in the body's vulnerability and power to harm, or he is degrading his body and others' out of traumatic self-loathing and depression... Either the film is pushing humility or indulging in a martial, even fascist, fantasy of celebrity.\\" Love objects are degraded in trauma films, but in Fight Club, degradation does not last to the film's conclusion. Gandal notes the separation, \\"[T]he abusive (and self-abusive) man and the degraded (and self-abusive) woman actually get together in the end‚Äîsomething seemingly unthinkable in a trauma film.\\" Fight Clubs ending has characteristics of slumming dramas' and trauma films' endings. Like the \\"wholesome\\" heroes, the nameless narrator ascends from \\"bohemian depths\\", but like in trauma films, the narrator is not \\"physically unscathed\\", suffering a gunshot wound through his cheek. Despite the protagonist and the love object uniting, the film remains hostile to sentimentality through the display of the gunshot wound and a spliced frame of a penis, one of Tyler Durden's hostile acts during the film. Consumerist culture Cultural critics Henry Giroux and Imre Szeman describe Fight Club as a failed critique which focuses on the consumerist culture and how it shapes male identity and ignores how neoliberal capitalism has dominated and exploited society. They write, \\"Fight Club has nothing substantive to say about the structural violence of unemployment, job insecurity, cuts in public spending, and the destruction of institutions capable of defending social provisions and the public good.\\" The film is \\"dangerously seductive\\" because of how it offers through Project Mayhem \\"a possible vision of a collective response... however disturbing such a response might be.\\" The vision, in the form of \\"regressive, vicious, and obscene\\" politics, is presented as the only possible alternative to defeat contemporary capitalism. Fight Club is a film that \\"very powerfully reveals the astonishing limits of our political imagination\\", focusing on masculinity and centering on a \\"hip, stylishly violent\\" narrative. The critics write, \\"It tells us very little... about the real circumstances and causes of our discontent, which lie in a very different place than in the seeming emasculation of that social group that wields perhaps the most concentrated power the world has ever seen‚Äîurban, upper- middle class, white, male technocrats.\\" Giroux and Szeman identify Tyler Durden as a failed icon of the revolution whose public appeal is more due to his cult personality than any \\"strengths of an articulated, democratic notion of political reform.\\" Durden acts instead of thinking and thereby fails to envision democratic movements; he is described as \\"a holdover of early- twentieth-century fascism\\". While the narrator represents the crisis of capitalism as a crisis of masculinity, Tyler Durden represents \\"redemption of masculinity repackaged as the promise of violence in the interests of social and political anarchy\\". In the film, Tyler Durden holds Raymond, a young Asian convenience store clerk, at gunpoint. Durden threatens to kill Raymond unless the clerk returns to veterinary school, a previous pursuit which Raymond had abandoned. The extortion is flawed because Durden treats choice as an individual act that can be willed through, ignoring societal dynamics. The critics write, \\"For Tyler, success is simply a matter of getting off one's backside and forging ahead; individual initiative and sheer force of will magically cancel out institutional constraints, and critiques of the gravity of dominant relations of oppression are dismissed as either an act of bad faith or the unacceptable whine of victimization.\\" The two critics outline three main absences in Fight Clubs critique. First, the film assumes that capitalism and consumerism are \\"impenetrable\\", and there cannot be resistance or struggle against them. Secondly, the film focuses instead on defending \\"authoritarian masculinity\\". The fight clubs' violence are complicit with the system of commodification that it denounces because it ties into instant gratification, heightened competitiveness, and \\"the market-driven desire\\" to dominate and win in fights. Lastly, Fight Club ascribes to a world under the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes in which cynicism replaces hope. The critics write of this world, \\"The survival of the fittest becomes the clarion call for legitimating dehumanizing forms of violence as a source of pleasure and sociality.\\" They summarize, \\"Fight Club appears to have no understanding of its own articulation with the very forces of capitalism it appears to be attacking. This is most evident in its linking of violence, masculinity, and gender. In other words, Fight Clubs vision of liberation and politics relies on gendered and sexist hierarchies that flow directly from the consumer culture it claims to be criticizing.\\" Fight Club is a reminder to have discourse about ethics and politics but its failed critique suggests \\"a more sustained and systemic critique\\" of societal conditions. Fascism Robert von Dassanowsky identifies Fight Club, alongside The Talented Mr. Ripley and Hannibal, as an American film released at the turn of the 21st century that examines European fascism through cinematic metaphor and explores fascism's cultural and sexual politics. Fight Clubs portrayal of the paramilitary Project Mayhem represents a response to the feminization of America, and the portrayal is reminiscent of the creation of Nazism in response to the \\"decadent\\" Weimar Republic of Germany. In the film, the counter to the feminized male is a model of male that is \\"an identity-less, violent and destructively nihilistic cadre that intends to discipline a world gone too tolerant\\". The paramilitary members' processing of human fat from liposuction into designer soap is a Holocaust reference. The process surpasses in potency Soylent Greens premise of processing people into food. Dassanowsky writes, \\"[It] is not only possible and marketable in the real world, but the very concept of this postmodern self-improvement elitism derives from the most horrific inhumanity in human history.\\" The film's embodiment of the crisis of masculinity is former bodybuilder Bob Paulson, played by Meat Loaf. As a result of steroid abuse, Bob has lost his testicles, developed \\"bitch tits\\", and become estranged from his family. His body and spirit are crippled by failed modernity's science and technology. He embodies how traditional patriarchy is being lost and how his generation fears feminization. Dassanowsky summarizes: > \\"Without his testicles and with female breasts Bob has become the extreme > metaphor for middle-class, male-led panic in the postmodern era, a setting > that features a recasting of the same factors of interwar German angst: > dehumanization through (post)modernity and its technology: international > economic and geopolitical instability; and lack of trust in social and > political concepts and/or the national identity and role.\\" Paulson is killed accidentally while participating in one of Project Mayhem's \\"urban terrorist\\" operations. In his death, he becomes \\"a mythical icon\\" who receives his name back, having previously gone nameless like other members of the Project. The scenario retells how Nazi activist Horst Wessel's death by communist activists was exploited by the Nazi movement to portray Wessel as a fallen hero. Dassanowsky observes the effect of Bob's death and the response to it, \\"Mythology and the constructed enemy against which Bob perished in battle obscure the Fight Club's reactionary 'revolution.'\\" Another member of Project Mayhem, Angel Face (played by Jared Leto), is disfigured by the narrator in Sadean destruction \\"of the 'normal' or ideal as sexual act\\". The disfigurement signifies how \\"there is no symbolic Other that is victimized or battles fascist oppression\\". The narrator himself is unable to recognize his actions as Tyler Durden. He attempts to rid himself of Durden, which is metaphoric of \\"the post-war trauma in dealing with fascist destruction\\". Fascism arises when humans fear inadequacy and losing social control. Audiences respond eagerly to the film's presentation of fascism, having a base desire \\"to experience the forbidden, to see the cornerstones of industry dynamited and collapse.\\" Fight Club concludes with the narrator and his female companion watching Project Mayhem's successful detonation of buildings that hold credit card information to reset society's debt. Dassanowsky writes of the conclusion, \\"The ecstasy of a fresh start that can not be reversed... as the Narrator and [Marla] hold hands while the buildings sink, [is] as potentially wish-fulfilling as any hyperthyroid promise Hitler may have made to a tired and bruised nation in 1933.\\" NotesReferences  * External links * Fight Club : A Ritual Cure For The Spiritual Ailment Of American Masculinity * doppelganger: exploded states of consciousness in fight club at Disinfo * Masculine Identity in the Service Class: An Analysis of Fight Club * Fight Club: An Exploration of Buddhism * Fight Club: The Return of Hobbes Fight Club ","title":"Interpretations of Fight Club"},{"id":"22827647","title":"Love of My Life (Sammy Kershaw song)"},{"id":"22827665","text":"Ornithonyssus is a mite genus of the family Macronyssidae.

In 1975, she began her art education at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe. In 1978, Tsinhnahjinnie enrolled in the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting with a photography minor in 1981.Biography: Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie. Women Artist of the American West: Lesbian Photography on the U.S. West Coast, 1972-1997.

Artwork Tsinhnahjinnie began her career as a painter, but \\"turned to photography as a weapon when her aesthetic/ethnic subjectivity came under fire.\\" Her body of work \\"plays upon her own autobiography and what it means to be a Native American.\\"Paul Apodaca, et al. \\"Native North American art.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 6 Mar. 2016.<http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T061112pg1>. Her work uses photography as a means to re-appropriate the Native American as subject. Although she is a photographer, Tsinhnahjinnie often hand-tints her photographs or uses them in collage. She has also used unusual supports for her work, such as car hoods. She shoots her own original photographs, but also frequently retools historical photographs of Native Americans to comment upon the ethnographic gaze of nineteenth-century white photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie also works in film and video. Using a combination of photography and digital images with a contemporary Native American photography style, she overcomes stereotypes, challenges political ideas, and creates a space for other Natives to express their ideas as well. Her goal with her art is not aimed at the non-natives but instead it is to document her life experience and share it with the world. In a statement on ‚ÄúAmerica Is a Stolen Land‚Äù, Tsinhnahjinnie says, ‚Äú.. the photographs I take are not for White people to look at Native people. I take photographs so Native people can look at Native people. I make photographs for Native people‚Äù. The Damn Series which she wrote in 1977 is Tsinhnahjinnie‚Äôs most widely known piece. Throughout the piece she works in Native knowledge (including humorous jokes) to repurpose images of Natives from colonialist history by shifting them back into a rightfully Indidegnous context. 20 years later, in 1994, Tsinhnahjinnie created a series called ‚ÄúMemoirs of an Aboriginal Savant‚Äù. She uses fifteen pages of an electronic diary to reflect on life with her family, politics, and other life experiences. The diary is all written with the idea in mind that she will take the viewer on a ‚Äújourney to the center of an aboriginal mind without the fear of being confronted by the aboriginal herself‚Äù. The book begins on the page ‚Äú1954‚Äù (her birth year) and continues to look deeply into her personal life experiences. Through the book she writes herself from a first person point of view in order to convey herself how she sees herself instead of others views. Career When she was 23, Tsinhanahjinne moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and stayed there for 20 years. During her time there she attended the Institute of American Indian Arts and received her BFA from the California College of Arts and Crafts. She also served as a board member for the Intertribal Friendship House, Oakland and the American Indian Contemporary Art Gallery while she was living there. Tsinhanahjinne chooses to display her art and passion through things like newsletters, posters, tshirts, and photos. She even teaches her skill of photography and media to younger students. Eventually after 20 years of hard work, in the year 2000 she was invited to get her MFA from the University of California Irvine. During her time at Irvine she focused her work toward digital photos and videos. In that same year, she was awarded the First Peoples Fund Community Spirit Award. Currently, Tsinhanahjinne is working as a professor of Native American Studies at the University of California Davis. While she has been working there she holds organized conferences that hold the purpose of bringing together native american photographers like herself to discuss topics such as ‚ÄúVisual Sovereignty‚Äù. Along with being a professor for the University, Tsinhanahjinne is the Director of C.N Gorman Museum for the school.  Intersectionality  As a not only a feminist but also a native american, Tsinhanahjinne experiences a different side of feminism that is intersectionality. Intersectional feminism is when you are not only experiencing the difficulties of all that comes with being women, but on top of that they struggle with discrimination against their race, disabilities, and/or wealth. One prominent site of intersectionality can be seen within the wage gap. It is known that women are already victims of the wage gap as the average annual male income is $48,893 where the average yearly female income is more than $10,000 less at $38,684. Women are already experiencing a wage gap for their gender, but intersectional women suffer even more from the gap. For example, the gap for non-colored/ white women is 23.86 cents, but for African-American women it‚Äôs 36.89 cents and Latinx is 45.9 cents. Tsinhanahjinne has had to fight with the wage gap her whole life being a part of the 28% of female professors.

He is deputy chairman of the Swedish Pirate Party. Engstr√∂m was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in the 2009 election.  Education and career  Christian Engstr√∂m was born in H√∂galid, Stockholm. He graduated from Stockholm University in 1983 with a degree in mathematics and computer science. While studying, Engstr√∂m worked as a tutor at the university, teaching object-oriented programming in Simula. From 1978 he also worked part-time as a programmer at Skriptor, a small company which specialized in phonetic similarity searches for trademark names. After finishing his studies he started working full-time at the company. He became a partner in the firm in 1987 and in 1991 he became vice president. In 1997 the company was sold to the leading European trademark search house CompuMark. Engstr√∂m stayed on in a similar capacity as before until 2001, when he left the company to set up his own consultancy firm Glindra AB.  Activism and politics  For five years Engstr√∂m worked as an unpaid activist within the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII), lobbying against software patents. He was active in the campaign against the EU software patent directive, which was rejected by the European Parliament in July 2005. He also co-founded the Swedish section of FFII and served as its deputy chairman during the first year. In the late 1980s, Engstr√∂m became a member of the Swedish Liberal People's Party. He served as a lay assessor () for the party in the Stockholm District Court between 1992 and 1998 and was active in local politics in Bromma, Stockholm. He left the Liberal People's Party on 1 January 2006, following the founding of the Pirate Party. Engstr√∂m was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in the election held on 7 June 2009, in which the Pirate Party won 7.1% of the votes and received one mandate. However, when the Lissabon treaty came into effect a second mandate Amelia Andersdotter entered parliament for Piratpartiet. Engstr√∂m was placed as his party's top candidate and received 43,808 votes (19% of the Pirate Party's total votes). After negotiations with some of the political groups of the European Parliament, it was announced on 25 June 2009 that Engstr√∂m will join the green group (Greens‚ÄìEFA). Engstr√∂m was the only Swedish member of the European Parliament who voted against Mary Honeyball's report \\"Sexual exploitation and prostitution and its impact on gender equality\\", which recommends EU member states to adopt the \\"Swedish Model\\" that criminalises the purchase of sexual services.  Personal life  Engstr√∂m is married and has one son. He lives with his family in Nacka, Stockholm County.

Taylor Alastair MacDonald Taylor (March 12, 1915 ‚Äì October 15, 2005) was a Canadian historian, filmmaker, United Nations official, professor of geography and political studies, and interdisciplinary thinker. He co- authored the first world-history textbook published in the United States. He played an active role in, and became the leading chronicler of, the diplomatic intervention by the United Nations to secure the independence of Indonesia. He was also among the first to apply systems theory to the historical development of human societies.  Biography  Taylor was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1915, the youngest son of Scottish immigrants. In 1930 the family moved to California, where he attended Hollywood High School and then the University of Southern California, from which he graduated summa cum laude in 1937. The topic of his Master's thesis at USC was \\"The Decline of Scottish Monasticism in the Fifteenth Century\\". At age 22 he collaborated with T. Walter Wallbank to begin writing Civilization Past and Present. The first world-history textbook in the United States, and a best-seller since its initial appearance in 1942, it has been published in many editions, and with additional authors, and is familiar to generations of students. In 1942 Taylor returned to Canada to enlist in the armed forces, but was recruited to the National Film Board in Ottawa, where he worked for pioneering documentary filmmaker John Grierson, making films for the war effort. Taylor himself directed two short films focusing on the situation of Canadian workers in the domestic wartime economy. Between 1944 and 1952 Taylor worked for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Washington, D.C. and then for the UN Secretariat in New York City. At UNRRA he was a speechwriter for Herbert Lehman, former governor of New York state, and then for Fiorello La Guardia, former mayor of New York City. Taylor became the Official Spokesman of the Security Council's United Nations Commission for Indonesia, which oversaw the peace settlement between the Netherlands and its former colony. In this capacity he spent several months in Indonesia in 1949 and 1950 and also attended the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in The Hague, Netherlands. Taylor received his doctorate from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1955. His dissertation was the basis for his book Indonesian Independence and the United Nations (1960), with a foreword by Lester B. Pearson. Upon its publication, this work was hailed as a \\"brilliant study of the protracted negotiations that led to Indonesia's independence\\"Irene Tinker, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 336 (July 1961), p. 201. and as \\"the fullest, most accurate, and least biased\\"Robert Van Niel, American Historical Review 66 (April 1961), p. 741. treatment in print of the UN's role. In 1960 Taylor joined the faculty of Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario, where he taught in both the Geography and Political Studies departments until 1980. At Queen's, in the early 1960s, he developed his systems-theory model of the historical evolution of human societies, which he designated Time-Space-Technics (TST). TST understands human societies as instances of open natural systems equilibrating with their environments in a hierarchy of integrative levels. It identifies an evolutionary sequence of world-views that organize societal systems at the different levels. Taylor named these world-views \\"Mythos\\", \\"Theos\\", \\"Logos\\", and \\"Holos\\". TST focuses on the interplay and tension between what Taylor called \\"material technics\\" and \\"societal technics\\", and attempts to identify factors responsible for fracturing a system's equilibrium and quantizing it to a different level of societal organization (either more or less complex). Taylor published a number of articles about the TST model and in his last years was preparing a book- length exposition of his ideas. He believed that modern society stands at a critical juncture: although industrial society has become culturally and environmentally unsustainable, we have the opportunity to replace it with new values and institutions appropriate to a sustainable global civilization.

His descendants lived in Zoucheng all the way to the present. Some of them migrated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. In the present day, there are four major sites in the city relating to Mencius: the Mencius Temple (), the Mencius Family Mansion (), the Mencius Forest (, ), and Mencius' Mother's Forest (, ). The Mencius Temple, which covers an area of more than on the south side of town, has five courtyards and sixty-four halls and rooms. Its history dates back to the year 1037 in the Northern Song dynasty. The Mencius Mansion, where his descendants lived, is adjacent to the temple, and has 116 halls and rooms. According to the management of the Mencius Temple, the temple grounds house over 270 stone steles and sculptures, some of which dating from as early as the Song dynasty.Overview of steles at the Temple of Mencius, placard on site.

Member of Parliament, 2009‚Äì2016 Shearer speaking to University of Otago academic Bryce Edwards in November 2011 Before his election as a Member of Parliament Shearer had twice previously stood for the Labour party: in 1999 he stood as a list-only candidate and in 2002 he unsuccessfully contested the WhangƒÅrei electorate. In May 2009 he returned to New Zealand and won the Labour Party nomination for Mount Albert against seven other candidates. He then won the 2009 Mt Albert by-election on 13 June 2009 with 13,260 votes, a majority of 9,718 over National's Melissa Lee. Shearer extended his majority over Lee to 10,021 in the 2011 general election. In the 2014 general election, Shearer further extended his majority over Lee to 10,656. =Labour Party leadership election, 2011= In December 2011, following the resignation of Phil Goff, Shearer contested for leadership of the Labour Party. His opponents were David Cunliffe and David Parker. Shearer was viewed as unlikely to win the election; Claire Trevett of The New Zealand Herald originally expected that only Cunliffe and Parker would run for the leader's role, and The Dominion Post Vernon Small wrote that \\"Mr Shearer's bid is seen as a way to lift his profile\\". On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe. On 13 December, Shearer was elected by the Labour caucus. Both One News' Espiner and 3 News reported that Shearer received about twenty-two of the thirty-four votes for the leadership position; however, Party President Moira Coatsworth stipulated that the election was secret and that she was the only person who had access to the ballot papers, which were destroyed. Grant Robertson won election as Shearer's deputy. =Leader of the Opposition, 2011‚Äì2013= Shearer addresses NetHui, July 2012 Political commentators opined that Shearer was moving the Labour Party towards the centre. Polls suggested that his performance as leader was rated unfavourably with the public, and he had poor name recognition. He was described as \\"the invisible man of New Zealand politics\\". In November 2012 during a Labour Party conference, media speculation suggested that Cunliffe, who was then economic development spokesperson, would launch a challenge against Shearer for leadership of the party. On the morning of 19 November, Cunliffe confirmed he was not challenging Shearer, and would indeed back him if a vote was taken. However, he also said he would not commit to supporting Shearer when he faces a formal confidence vote in February 2013. Media speculation about Cunliffe's intentions marred Shearer's first 12 months as leader. Labour MPs unanimously endorsed leader Shearer at the annual conference, and Shearer subsequently demoted Cunliffe from the front bench. Shearer continued to face dissent within the party caucus. He announced his resignation as Labour leader on 22 August 2013, stating that: \\"My sense is I no longer have the full confidence of many of my caucus colleagues\\". Following a party-wide leadership election, Cunliffe was elected Shearer's successor over Deputy Leader Robertson. Shearer remained in Parliament and retained his seat at the 2014 election. =Resignation= On 8 December 2016 Shearer announced he would resign from Parliament after being chosen to head the United Nations Mission in South Sudan by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, replacing Dane Ellen Margrethe L√∏j. His resignation forced a by- election for his seat in the electorate, which lead to future Labour leader and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern winning the seat. Personal achievements In 1992 Shearer, and his wife Anuschka Meyer, were named the New Zealanders of the Year by The New Zealand Herald after running one of the biggest aid camps in Somalia. In the 1993 New Year Honours Shearer was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire for welfare services to children in Somalia. In 1994 he was awarded Save the Children's international Award for Gallantry for service in areas of conflict.

Service on the line was provided by the Erie Railroad. The Montclair Railway was established in 1867. It was founded by Julius Pratt, who had renamed Montclair, New Jersey, for what was then West Bloomfield. By the mid-1870s it ran between Croxton and Sterling Forest at the New York state line, but the financially unstable railroad went into receivership, and in 1875 became the Montclair and Greenwood Lake Railway In 1878 the company was re-organized as the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway (NYGL), under control of the Erie. In 1887, the Erie created a new subsidiary, the Arlington Railroad, to create a new, more direct ROW in the Kearny Meadows between the Hackensack River and Passaic River. In the mid-1890s, the Erie greatly expanded the infrastructure and service on the Greenwood Lake, taking over the Watchung Railway in 1895 and the Caldwell Railway and the Roseland Railway in 1897, the former becoming the Orange Branch and the latter two the Caldwell Branch. In 1897, the Erie opened the DB Draw over the Hackensack and the WR Draw over the Passaic providing the company a modernized ROW from its Pavonia Terminal through the Long Dock Tunnel and across the Meadows. The property was acquired directly in 1943 by the Erie Railroad, which merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1960, to create the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad. Passenger service on the line north of Mountain View, to Greenwood Lake, was abandoned in stages. Conrail operated commuter rail on the line from 1976 to 1982, when New Jersey Transit Rail Operations took over. The line south and east of Mountain View is operated as part of the Montclair-Boonton Line and runs now to Hoboken, with Midtown Direct service into New York Penn Station. Three passenger stations (Arlington, Rowe Street and Benson Street) were abandoned when the Montclair Connection opened in 2002. Conrail continued to operate freight service on the line until 1999, when the Norfolk Southern Railway took over. Norfolk Southern operated on the Orange Branch until 2010 when the last remaining shipper Hartz Mountain closed their Bloomfield plant. A short segment of the Orange Branch was brought back into use for passengers as part of the Newark Light Rail, with stations at Silver Lake and Grove Street.

Los Angeles Township consisted of areas surrounding the original city lands of Los Angeles, then a four-league square bordered by Hoover Street, Fountain Avenue, Indiana Street and Exposition Boulevard. These included the San Fernando Valley and present-day West Los Angeles and East Los Angeles. Most of this area has now been annexed to the city of Los Angeles, but a few portions exist as independent cities, including Glendale, Burbank and Santa Monica.

Life The eldest son of Edward Newton of Park House, in Butley, a part of the parish of Prestbury, Cheshire, he was educated first at the Macclesfield grammar school by John Brownsword, a much-praised schoolmaster. Newton went on to Trinity College, Oxford, which he left in 1562 to study at Queen's College, Cambridge, but then returned to his original college. In 1569 or 1570, he published The Worthye Booke of Old Age. The book's preface was dated \\"frome Butleye the seuenth of March 1569\\", and many of his other books before 1583 were dated from the same place. He wrote books on historical, medical and theological subjects, and contributed many commendatory verses in English and Latin to various works, a common practice of the time. For many of his verses and books he styles himself \\"Thomas Newtonus Cestreshyrius\\", showing an evident affection for his county of birth. He may have practiced as a physician in Butley and taught at Macclesfield school. In 1583 he was appointed rector of Little Ilford, Essex, from where most of his later works are dated. His most significant publications were a series of translations of Cicero and of Seneca's tragedies.Oxford DNB, 2004-12. Atropoion Delion; or, The Death of Delia, a pastoral elegy on the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603 may have been by this Thomas Newton. According to The Dictionary of National Biography: :\\"Newton was a skilled writer of Latin verse, in which, Ritson states, he excited the admiration of his contemporaries; while Warton describes him as the elegant Latin encomiast and the first Englishman who wrote Latin elegiacs with classical clearness and terseness. He also wrote English verses with ease and fluency, and translated several works from the Latin. All his books are now very scarce; most of them have very long titles.\\" Newton was married and the father of two sons, Emanuel (who seems to have died before his father) and Abel. After his death in 1607 (sometime between 27 April, when his will was dated, and 13 June, when it was proved at Canterbury), he was probably buried at Little Ilford.
