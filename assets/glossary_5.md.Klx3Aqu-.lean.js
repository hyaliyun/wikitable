His reign was characterized by the expansion of Ahom kingdom which resulted in conflicts with the Nagas and with the Kachari kingdom. He was successful in the military actions against the Nagas, while in case of Kacharis, he suffered defeat and had to sue for peace with the Kacharis. He was assassinated by one Ahom of Tairungban clan. Ancestry and accession Suhenphaa was the son of Ahom king Susenphaa. Susenphaa ruled for a long period of 49 years, during which the kingdom witnessed peace and prosperity. When Susenphaa died in 1488 CE, Suhenphaa succeeded him as the king of Ahom kingdom. Reign =Conflicts with Nagas= The Tangsu Nagas, who were defeated during the reign of Suhenphaa‚Äôs father Susenphaa, again raised their banner against the royal authority. They began to raids villages in the plains of Brahmaputra and took common Assamese people as prisoner. To counter this acts of atrocities by Tangsu Nagas, Suhenphaa dispatched Taokangbanrek Borgohain with a contingent of Ahom soldiers. The Tangsu Nagas attacked the Ahom forces and completely destroyed it. The commander of the army, Taokangbanrek Borgohain was captured and later beheaded by the Nagas. His head was taken by the Tangsu Nagas to their native villages as prize of battle. Suhenphaa immediately ordered fresh recruitment of soldiers and after gathering a huge army, he dispatched the newly appointed Nangraang Borgohain against the Tangsu Nagas. After fierce battle, Nangraang Borgohain scored complete victory against the Tangsu Nagas, and they were forced to submit to the Ahoms. The Tangsu Nagas also agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Ahom king. Nangraang Borgohain brought several Naga prisoners as a symbol of his victory and after obtaining permission from Suhenphaa, settled them in different parts of the Ahom kingdom. =War with the Kacharis= Suhenphaa desired to expand his kingdom towards downstream of Brahmaputra river. The Kacharis who, at that time, held a large portion of Upper Assam, obstructed the expansion of Ahom kingdom into their territory. Suhenphaa decided to use force, and ordered one Ahom officer Chelaoseng Neog to construct a fortification at Tongsu within Kachari territory. The fortification was constructed without any opposition from Kacharis. Encouraged by this success, he dispatched Khunlung Burhagohain with an army to march further inwards into Kachari territory. The Kacharis fiercely resisted the advance of Khunlung Burhagohain and were successful in defeating the Ahom army. One Ahom commander Jiyeumung Neog and 150 soldiers lost their lives. The Kacharis chased Ahoms to the banks of Dikhou river. The commander of Ahom army, Khunlung Burhagohain managed to escape by swimming across the Dikhou river, leaving his elephants and other valuables. After consultations with the nobles, Suhenphaa sued for peace with the Kachari king. A princess was sent to the Kachari king with two elephants and twelve female slaves as her dowry. Some chronicles stated that the result of the battle was indecisive, and when peace was made, the Kacharis ceded some territory to Ahom. . =Assassination= One Ahom named Lantarunban of Tairungban clan was caught for stealing some paddy from the royal granary. He and his companions were punished and fined for their crime. therefore Lantaruban and his friends were eager to exact revenge on the king. In 1493 CE, Lantaruban and his friends were engaged on some repairs in the Royal Palace. While coming for work, Lantaruban hid a spear inside the hollow space of one bamboo. When Suhenphaa came to inspect the progress of the work, Lantaruban stabbed the king to death with the spear(some account say the king was stabbed with pointed bamboo). According to some accounts, the murder was instigated by Khunlung Burhagohain. Suhenphaa had three sons. The eldest among them, Supimphaa will succeed as the king of Ahom kingdom. Character and legacy Suhenphaa‚Äôs reign showed the continuation of the policy of expansion of Ahom kingdom. His conflict with the Kacharis proves the fact that the Ahoms wanted to expand their territory, in expense of their neighbouring kingdoms. Though Suhenphaa suffered defeat in the hands of Kacharis, the conflict which he started will be continued by his grandson Suhungmung, who will conduct successful military operations against the Kacharis and the Chutiyas extending the boundaries of Ahom kingdom. He also seem to be very strict administrator, owing to which persons found guilty of criminal activities cannot escape punishment, but unfortunately this very quality of him made enemies among some influential people of the court, who then plotted his assassination.

In order to exact revenge on the murderers of his father Suhenphaa, he unleased a reign of terror among people of both high and low ranks alike. Due to some minor fault, he even exiled one of his wives to Naga Hills, who was pregnant at that time. She later gave birth to a son named Kancheng, who would be appointed as the first Borpatrogohain of Ahom kingdom and will be known for his military geniuses and courage. Ancestry and accession Supimphaa was the eldest son of Ahom king Suhenphaa. After his father‚Äôs assassination in 1493 CE, Susenphaa ascended the throne as the new king of Ahom kingdom. Reign =Punishment of the murderers of Suhenphaa= The first act of Supimphaa, after ascending to the throne, was to trace out and execute the conspirators who had plotted and assassinated his father Suhenphaa. The main accused Lantarunban and his two sons, Taophrong and Khuntao was arrested after some search operations. Later all three of them were executed. Other co-conspirators were also punished for their co-operation in the crime. Khunlung Burhagohain was also suspected to have links in the conspiracy. Therefore, fearing punishment from the king, Khunlung Burhagohain fled from his quarters. Supimphaa immediately dismissed Khunlung Burhagohain from his office, and appointed another member of Burhagohain family, Khunlung Khampeng as the new Burhagohain. Later Khunlung Burhagohain was arrested but he escaped the capital punishment as the nobles requested the king to grant forgiveness. The property of Khunlung Burhagohain was confiscated and he was exiled to his village residence. =Exile of the royal consort and birth of Kancheng= The Nagas had maintained friendly relations since the time of Supimphaa‚Äôs father, king Suhenphaa. Every year, they come to pay tribute and respect to the Ahom king in the Capital. One of the wives of Supimphaa happened to see a Naga chief who had come to pay tribute, and praised his beauty in the king‚Äôs hearing. The king was so enraged and furious that he immediately ordered her exile to the Naga village, from which that Naga chief belonged. She was pregnant at the time and subsequently gave birth to a son. He was named as Senglung, but he will be become famous as Kancheng. Supimphaa‚Äôs successor Suhungmung would come to know about Kancheng and his royal origin. He brought Kancheng to his court and appointed him to the newly created office of Borpatrogohain, equal in ranks with the office of Burhagohain and Borgohain. Kancheng Borpatrogohain would serve Suhungmung in many battles and under his military leadership, the Ahom army reached the banks of Karatoya river, the western boundary of ancient Kamrup Kingdom. Death During his short reign (1493 CE-1497 CE), Supimphaa tried to trace out all people who were in league with the conspiracy in assassination of his father, Suhenphaa. Many people were traced out and then they along with their relatives were tortured and severely punished. The nobles were terrified by these high handed actions of the king. While these search operations were going on, Supimphaa died, suddenly in 1497 CE. Historical accounts vary regarding the cause of his death. Some accounts attribute his death to natural cause, while some records maintained that he was assassinated. Prominent Assamese historian and writer Gunaviram Burua stated since the assassination of Suhenphaa caused much unrest and terror among the people, therefore, the nobles after assassinating Supimphaa, hide the real facts and spread the news of the death of king due to natural causes. Supimphaa was succeeded by his son Suhungmung, whose reign was characterized by expansion of Ahom kingdom into the territories of Kachari kingdom and Chutiya kingdom.

Many denominations of the religion of Islam (the largest faith) are represented. Christians (principally Catholics) represent 5%. Traditional beliefs are officially practiced by 1% of the population, particularly Serer, but members of other religions also often partake in traditional practices.http://www.africaguide.com/country/senegal/culture.htm Religious freedom is protected in Senegal by law. Senegalese culture, in general, is religiously tolerant.United States Department of State Major religions in Senegal =Islam= The Great Mosque of Touba, home of the Mouride Sufi brotherhood About 95% of the Senegalese population is Muslim, and many denominations of this faith are practised. Approximately 1% of the Muslim population practices Ahmadiyya Islam. Sufism is represented in Senegal by the following brotherhoods: Tijanism, Mouridism, Qadiriyya, and Layenism. More recently, the NabyAllah movement has emerged and constructed the Mosque of the Divinity in Ouakam. The Layenes are a Muslim brotherhood based in Mahdism. This group originated in Yoff, a Lebou village that has become a commune d'arondissement of Dakar. The founder is Seydina Limamou Laye. He began his pr√©dication May 24, 1883, at the age of 40, presenting himself as the Imam of \\"Bien Guid√©s\\" or \\"imamoul Mahdi.\\" He taught and preached religious law and worship \\"clean and sincere,\\" removed from the traditions that he judged were not conforming to Islam. Tijanism (Tar√Æqah Tij√¢niyyah) is the most important Sufi brotherhood in Senegal. In Senegal, the principal holy city of Tijanism is Tivouane, the home of marabout Malick Sy (d. 1922). Sy left a legacy of pacifist teachings. Il y a aussi Sokone Avec El Hadji Amadou D√©me (1895-1973). Kaolack is another important city, for being the seat of marabout Baye Niass (1900-1975) who also taught a pacifist message. The first propagators were Oumar Tall who tried to lead a holy war (1852-1864) against the French and Mouhammadoul H√¢met BA. After the 2002 general census of the Senegalese population, the followers of Tijianism constitute around 60% of all Senegalese, making it the most represented brotherhood in the country. The Mouride constitute one of the most important brotherhoods in Senegal, and the most important Sufi brotherhood in Sub-Saharan Africa. The religious center of Mourides is the city of Touba, which houses one of the largest mosques in Africa. The founder of the Mouride brotherhood is Marabout Ahmadou Bamba (1853‚Äì1927). Each year, the Mourides commemorate the exile of Bamba during Magal, celebrated in the holy city of Touba. Each year, not less than two million people make this pilgrimage. Mourides constitute around 28% of the Senegalese population. The Qadiriyya brotherhood is the oldest in Senegal, founded by the Sufi mystic Abd al Qadir al-Jilani in the 12th century. Qadiriyya constitute around 6% of the Senegalese population. Shia Islam is the dominant religion among the Lebanese community of Senegal. Since the 1970s, the number of native Senegalese Shi'i Muslims has been growing significantly.Leichtman, Mara A. (2016).

Bloomington: Indiana University Press, Public Cultures of the Middle East and North Africa series. =Christianity= Our Lady of Victories Roman Catholic Cathedral in Dakar. Primarily found in the south of Senegal, in the Casamance region, Christians are largely of Serer heritage. They are also found in the large cities of Senegal, such as Dakar and Saint- Louis. Senegalese Christians have a site of pilgrimage at Popenguine. The Cathedral of Dakar was constructed at the beginning of the 20th century by father Daniel Brottier, founder of the orphelins apprentis d'Auteuil. Protestantism is equally represented, among others, by the Protestant Church of Senegal. =Other beliefs= Serer cosmogonyMadiya, Cl√©mentine Fa√Øk-Nzuji, \\"Canadian Museum of Civilization\\", Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies, \\"International Centre for African Language, Literature and Tradition\\", (Louvain, Belgium), pp 27, 155, *Gravrand, Henry, La civilisation sereer, vol.

The religious affairs of Serer religion devotees are usually headed by the Saltigue (the Serer priestly class) which in ancient times was the preoccupation of the Serer lamanic class.Galvan, Dennis Charles, \\"The State Must Be Our Master of Fire: How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal\\", Berkeley, University of California Press (2004), pp 53, 185Sarr, Alioune, \\"Histoire du Sine-Saloum\\", Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n¬∞ 3-4, 1986‚Äì1987. p.31 Some of these religious festivals or ceremonies include the Ndut (rite of passage), Xooy (divination festival once a year in Fatick), and the Raan festival. Senegalese hold several ancient beliefs, such as small efforts of 'thanks' or demands, such as protection from water. They also place great importance on the Baobab tree, which is known as the \\"House of the Spirits.\\" The baobab tree along with other sacred trees figure prominently in the Serer creation narrative.Thiaw, Issa laye, \\"Mythe de la cr√©ation du monde selon les sages sereer\\", pp. 45‚àí50, 59‚àí61 [in] \\"Enracinement et Ouverture\\" ‚Äì \\"Plaidoyer pour le dialogue interreligieux\\", Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (23 and 24 June 2009), Dakar Among the Jola people, some religious festivals include the Samay, Kumpo and the Niasse. Youth religiosity in Senegal Religion is an integral part of daily life in Senegal, and this occurs very differently for adults and youths. Though many standard practices such as the celebration of large Senegalese religious holidays like Tabaski maintain importance for Senegalese people of all generations, other practices such as daily prayer and abstinence from drinking and drugs take on different roles for Senegalese youth than for their parents.Diouf, Mamadou. \\"Urban Youth and Senegalese Politics: Dakar 1988-1994.\\" Political Culture 8 (1996): 225‚Äì49. JSTOR. Web. 16 Apr. 2013. But along with youths who have liberalized their understanding of religion, there are many Senegalese youth who have made changes of a more fundamentalist nature. Many Senegalese youth are reinstating earlier understandings of Islam, in many instances incorporating religion into their lives to a greater extent than that of their parents. =Changes in religiosity= A notable sign of changing generational levels of religiosity is how youth have changed their interactions with the national political system. On one hand, an increase in religiosity of Senegalese youth has caused them to promote an increased level of religious involvement in political decision-making. Conversely, many youth-led political movements are associated with groups of young people who tend to deviate from the religious expectations of their parents, partaking in alcohol consumption as well as elements of hip hop culture. For example, the Y'en a Marre (\\"Fed Up\\") movement that developed in January 2011 in response to the government inefficiency and youth un-involvement in Senegal was almost entirely youth-driven. On the other hand, many Senegalese youth movements have centered on increasing the role of religion in political systems, particularly at the university level. Many student organizations have been created to attempt to promote these traditional values to Senegalese public life and politics. These groups include the Hizbut-Tarqiyyah, and the Association Musulmane des Etudiants d'Afrique Noire (AMEAN). Throughout the 1960s and 70s this upturn in religiosity was seen through the building of new mosques, and an increase in attention on Islamic organizations and news publications. These movements have many sources of inspiration, some local and some international. Scholars have claimed that it is sometimes a lack of access to resources that drive youth to use religion as a source of empowerment, as well as a justification for violence in certain instances. However, in Senegal in the 1990s Islamic revivalism originated largely from educated youths who had attended secular French schools. The existing literature about youth religiosity and politics in West Africa focuses on males, since they tend to dominate roles of religious authority in Muslim structures. This bias makes it even more difficult to make any generalizations about youth religiosity, since it would frequently be disregarding the sentiments of a large portion of the population. But it is apparent that religion serves a very different function for youth of this generation than it did for the previous one, in a pattern that was certainly passed down from the one before.

There were disputes with Circassians, who demanded the events be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for the 19th century Circassian genocide, environmental and economic issues, lack of political stability and governance, and the safety and human rights of LGBT athletes and journalists, in light of Russia's \\"gay propaganda\\" laws, which sparked Olympic-focused protests. However, all of these events were overshadowed by the massive Russian state- sponsored doping program uncovered in the aftermath of the Games. Human rights On 30 January 2014, nine Amnesty International European directors delivered a petition in Moscow to the offices of Russian President Vladimir Putin calling on him to repeal a series of laws restricting the right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of association in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics. The organization felt that the laws were no substitute for an effective justice system, and demanded the Russian authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all prisoners of conscience (POCs). The Russian parliament passed an amnesty bill that freed the imprisoned Pussy Riot singers, the foreign activists amongst Greenpeace's \\"Arctic 30\\" and the 2012 Bolotnaya Square protest. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly presented the IOC detailed evidence of documented human rights abuses linked to Russia's preparations for the 2014 Winter Games since 2009. Human Rights Watch have documented exploitation of migrant workers in violation of Russian law; evictions of residents without fair compensation and in some cases, with no compensation at all. Many resettled residents lost a portion of their livelihoods; Threats, harassment, and lawsuits of activists and journalists critical of the Games, as well as Russia's discriminatory anti-LGBT propaganda law. Not before late 2013 the Russian government and IOC covered $8.34 million in wage arrears. Both German president Joachim Gauck and European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Viviane Reding publicly boycotted the Games over human rights abuses, with Reding specifically citing Russia's treatment of minorities. On 21 January 2014 Russian authorities sentenced left activist Vladislav Ryazantsev to 15 days. Ryazantsev is one of the leaders of the Left Front movement. He has been arrested allegedly for swearing at a bus stop late one evening. Vladislav Ryazantsev and his fellow activists had planned to hold an action under the slogan of boycott of Sochi Olympics. On 5 February 2014 Russian authorities sentenced environmental activist Igor Kharchenko to five days. Kharchenko is member of the Russian NGO Environmental Watch for North Caucasus (Ecologicheskaya Vakhta po Severnomu Kavkazu). He has been arrested and his car was vandalized. Sergei Nikitin, Amnesty International's Moscow Office Director said: \\"The Russian authorities must halt their harassment of civil society activists, protect the right to peaceful freedom of expression, and release the Sochi prisoners of conscience: Igor Kharchenko and his fellow environmentalist Yevgeny Vitishko, who is currently serving 15 days in administrative detention on trumped-up charges.\\" Evgeny Vitishko was arrested for 15 days in the Sochi area reportedly charged allegedly for swearing at a bus stop. Yevgeniy Vitishko and his fellow activists have been actively involved in protests regarding the deforestation and illegal construction and fencing in areas of protected forest around Sochi. AI is concerned about his unfair trial resulted in a court decision to send him to prison colony for three years. =Police arrests= Two members of the punk group Pussy riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, and a group of activists and journalists were arrested by Russian police in Sochi when simply walking down the street. Pussy Riot members have urged politicians attending the Winter Olympics to criticise human rights abuses in Russia. According to Amnesty International people are being targeted for peacefully speaking their minds. Almost daily there are reports of arrests of activists in Sochi and the Olympic Games area including Semyon Simonov Memorial, David Hakim and journalists from Radio Free Europe and Novaya Gazeta. Amnesty demanded the International Olympic Committee to condemn the arrests. =LGBT rights= The rights of LGBT people in Russia were a concern leading up to the Games (where seven openly lesbian and bisexual, athletes, all female, were scheduled to participate). Russia became the subject of international criticism following the signing of a federal law by Vladimir Putin in June 2013, which banned the distribution of \\"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\\" among minors. Mass media classified the legislation as being \\"anti-gay\\", while LGBT rights activists considered the law to be too broad and vague, characterizing it as an effective ban on promoting LGBT rights and culture. Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin argued that even kissing a same-sex partner or displaying LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag could be illegal under the law. The legislation was also attributed to an increase in homophobic violence in Russia by anti-gay and Neo-Nazi groups. Critics also considered the law to be inconsistent with principle six of the Olympic Charter, which states that \\"any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.\\" \\" Assurances In August 2013, the IOC stated that it had \\"received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games\\"; this was contradicted in a statement three days later made by Russia's Ministry of the Interior, which stated that the anti-propaganda laws would still be enforced in Sochi. The IOC also confirmed that it would enforce Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which forbids political protest, against athletes who make displays of support for the LGBT community. The IOC received written assurance from the Russian government in August 2013 stating that it was committed to abiding by the Olympic Charter during the Olympic Games. Vladimir Putin also made similar assurances prior to the Games, but warned LGBT attendees to abide by the law. Anatoly Pakhomov, mayor of Sochi, explained to reporters prior to the Games that homosexuality \\"was not the custom in the Caucasus\\", and claimed that no gays lived in Sochi at all (despite the presence of two gay clubs and evidence of a LGBT community in Sochi on a Russian social network). He went on to say that everyone, including gays, were welcome in Sochi, \\"as long as they do not impose their habits on others.\\" Protests and campaigns Despite these assurances, Olympic-focused protests and campaigns, such as the Principle 6 campaign (a collaboration between a group of Olympic athletes, the organizations All Out, Athlete Ally, and clothing maker American Apparel), have been held in protest of Russia's anti-gay policies. There were also calls to boycott the Games, drawing comparisons to the Summer Olympics of 1980 in Moscow. However, a writer for the Financial Times felt that such a boycott would be counter-productive, given that there was no boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing despite China's poor human rights record, but suggested that action by Olympic sponsors would be more effective. At January 2014 Russian leader of the Left Front movement Vladislav Ryazantsev together with like-minded persons opened out an informative campaign against Olympic Games in Sochi. In the social network of VK.com appeared the group ¬´Boycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi¬ª in which Ryazantsev united with left activist Anton Morvan publishes devastating information about the cost of Olympic Games and scales saw cut at its preparation. In addition, the group collects information about the game shooting of animals in the city-resort. ‚Äî The Group ¬´Boycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi¬ª is one of many private initiatives of left activists. Its purpose is collection and publication of true information about violations, crimes and peculations during the preparation of the Olympic Games, helping to open eyes people¬ª, ‚Äî Vladislav Ryazantsev reported to the journalist of Donnews.ru. ‚Äî ¬´In addition, we call to declare boycott, avoid watching the games and buying commodities with symbolism of Olympic Games¬ª. A number of world leaders, including United States president Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and French President Fran√ßois Hollande, declined to attend the Games' Opening Ceremony as delegates for various reasons. Although attending the Winter Olympics has not historically been a priority for world leaders, there was still speculation that their non-attendance was a symbolic boycott of Russian policies. The U.S. appointed tennis player Billie Jean King and women's hockey player Caitlin Cahow, who are both openly gay, as its delegation instead. Although Obama stressed diversity and made no reference to the controversy when announcing the delegation, on 6 February 2014, he confirmed the intent of the choices during an interview with Bob Costas aired by NBC the next day, stating that \\"there is no doubt we wanted to make it very clear that we do not abide by discrimination in anything, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\\" Cahow stated that the decision was meant to \\"[highlight] Americans who know what it means to have freedoms and liberties under the Constitution. That's really what we're representing in Sochi and it's not at all different from what's espoused in the spirit of Olympism.\\" In February 2014, prior to the games, a group of 40 human rights organizations (including Athlete Ally, Freedom House, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch and Russian LGBT network among others) sent a joint letter to the ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies, urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter, and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the human rights abuses of future host countries. On 3 February 2014, USOC sponsor AT&T; issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games, becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws. Several major non-sponsors also made pro-LGBT statements to coincide with the opening of the Games; Google placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic-themed logo in the colors of the rainbow flag on its home page worldwide, while Channel 4 (who serves as the official British broadcaster of the Paralympics) adopted a rainbow-colored logo and broadcast a \\"celebratory\\", pro-LGBT advert entitled \\"Gay Mountain\\" on 7 February 2014, alongside an interview with former rugby union player and anti-homophobia activist Ben Cohen. The Huffington Post noted that the opening ceremony, ironically, featured tributes to \\"some of history's most widely acclaimed and definitely gay Russians\\", including composer Peter Tchaikovsky (1840‚Äì1893), ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky (1889‚Äì1950), and patron of arts, and founder of Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev. Russian organizers denied any connection, stating that these figures were selected because of their cultural significance. On the same topic, critics also noted the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u were invited to perform during the opening ceremony; although they are not actually lesbian, the all-female duo were well known for incorporating themes of lesbianism in their music and on-stage personas (live appearances often featured the singers kissing each other), its name is a corruption of a shortened Russian phrase meaning \\"this girl loves that girl\\", and the duo made a statement in support of LGBT rights in the wake of Yuri Luzhkov's objection to the 2007 Moscow Pride parade. Organizers noted that t.A.T.u were chosen because they were well known to an international audience, denying any relation to LGBT rights.  Doping scandal  In December 2014, German public broadcaster ARD aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In November 2015, Russia's track and field team was provisionally suspended by the IAAF. In May 2016, The New York Times published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping. In December 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. La Gazzetta dello Sport reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation. Three ladies artistic skaters were named as being under investigation. They are Adelina Sotnikova, the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Ksenia Stolbova. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds. Six skiers were provisionally suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren report: Evgeniy Belov, Alexander Legkov, Alexey Petukhov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yulia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova. Legkov won a gold medal, and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals. The International Biathlon Union provisionally suspended two biathletes who were in the Sochi games: Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport. Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal. They both retired after the 2014/2015 season. The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation provisionally suspended four skeleton sliders. They are among the six athletes on the skeleton team: Nikita Tregubov, Alexander Tretyakov, Sergey Chudinov, Elena Nikitina, Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a silver. It has been speculated that some Russia's Winter Olympians used xenon gas in preparation for the Sochi Games. Using xenon gas is not specifically banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA); however, it could be used for performance enhancement and raises questions about what constitutes doping and practices that should and should not be allowed.  Event judging  =Allegations of vote swapping= French sports newspaper L'√âquipe, quoting an anonymous Russian coach, alleged that Russia and the United States would swap votes, with the United States voting for Russian athletes in pairs figure skating and team events and Russia voting for the Americans in ice dancing. The allegations were categorically denied by U.S. Figure Skating. =Men's ice hockey tournament= During a men's ice hockey tournament round-robin game between USA and Russia, a Russian goal scored late in the third period, which would have given the team a 3‚Äì2 lead, was disallowed after referees ruled that the net was moved when the goal was scored. The decision resulted in the score remaining 2‚Äì2. USA went on to win the game in a shootout, which resulted in Russia playing a playoff qualification game while USA received a bye to the quarterfinals. The decision was criticized by many Russian politicians, TV hosts and commentators. Following the game, protesters led by the Kremlin party's youth group held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to protest the decision. In response to the controversy, Konstantin Komissarov, the referee supervisor of International Ice Hockey Federation, officially confirmed that the decision by the referee was correct, citing the appropriate use of video review in assessing the play. =Ladies' singles figure skating= Immediately after the final scores were announced, journalistic questions arose regarding whether 17-year-old Russia's Adelina Sotnikova's performance deserved higher scores than the performances of the 23-year-old figure skater South Korea's Yuna Kim. Questions over the judges, the judging system, and the anonymity of scores were also raised in the press.  Official responses  On 21 February 2014, the International Skating Union (ISU) issued a statement which asserted all rules and procedures were applied during the competition and that no official protest had been filed by any participating nation concerning the results of the competition. Such a protest must be done within 30 minutes of the event. ISU's 21 February 2014 statement declaring their confidence \\"in the high quality and integrity of the ISU judging system\\". Adding \\"judges were selected by random drawing from a pool of 13 potential judges\\" and all nine judges on the free skating panel were from different nations. On 10 April, the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) and the Korean Skating Union (KSU) filed an official complaint with the ISU Disciplinary Commission (DC) concerning judging. The complaint was regarding \\"the wrongful constitution of the panel of judges and the unjust outcome of the competition\\". It requested that the DC conduct a thorough investigation, \\"take appropriate disciplinary actions against the concerned individuals\\", and institute corrective actions. On 14 April, the DC ruled the complaint inadmissible because a general request for investigation is not within DC's jurisdiction and the complaint was not addressed at an individual or federation as required. On 30 April, the KOC and KSU filed a second official complaint with the DC. This time the complaint was against Alla Shekhovtsova and Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FSFR), specifically citing a hug Shekhovtsova shared with Sotnikova and Shekhovtsova's marriage to the current Director General of the FSFR. On 30 May, the DC dismissed the complaint. It ruled Shekhovtsova \\"is not responsible for the judging panel's composition\\", her marriage did not create a conflict of interest, and since Sotnikova initiated the hug, Shekhovtsova did not break any rules by responding. As of June 2014, the KOC and KSU are considering appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).  Opinions  USA Today reported \\"A high- ranking Olympic figure skating official ‚Ä¶ said the geographic makeup of the judging panel 'was clearly slanted towards ‚Ä¶ Sotnikova.'\\" The free skating panel included two Russian officials, a Russian judge and a Ukrainian judge. Journalists questioned the appointments of Russian judge Alla Shekhovtsova, the wife of the former president and the current general director of Figure Skating Federation of Russia Valentin Piseev, and Ukrainian judge Yuri Balkov, who was suspended for a year after being caught on tape attempting to fix the ice dancing competition at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The technical panel, that oversees correct execution of elements, is headed by fellow Russian Alexander Lakernik. Shekhovtseva was photographed hugging Sotnikova in the arena, raising another question of bias. The detailed score sheet shows that one judge gave Adelina Sotnikova +3 grade of execution (GOE) on all except two elements. In contrast, the score sheet of short program shows that one judge gave Yuna Kim +0 grade of execution on her triple flip, of which the NBC commentator Tracy Wilson commented as 'another perfect flip'. Journalists and experts argued that scores given to Adelina Sotnikova were inflated both in the short and long programs. She was inexplicably scored above all others in the free program, where most believed she merited only 4th place in the phase behind Yuna, Mao Asada, and Carolina Kostner. Many among them cite that certain judges gave generous scores along with fellow Russian competitor Yulia Lipnitskaya. In particular, numerous +3 grade of executions were handed out to the two Russian skaters as well as nods in component scores compared to other skaters. Others noted that Sotnikova made a mistake by stepping out of one of her jumps which got a ‚àí0.9 grade of execution in the scorecards. Ryan Bradley, 2011 US champion, asked \\"Are we just going to ignore that she botched the landing of her 3 jump and pretend she was perfect?\\" There are also debates about whether Sotnikova's triple lutz had a wrong edge on takeoff and the triple toe loop in her first jumping pass was under-rotated. Neither error was flagged by the event's technical panel. Retired national-level figure skater Tim Gerber wrote a letter to the ISU, claiming that Sotnikova's triple triple combination jump should have received wrong edge and under rotation. Gerber also asserted that the step sequence levels were not correctly awarded for Kim and Sotnikova. He stated that Kim's step sequence should have received a level four (instead of three) and Sotnikova's step sequence should have received a level three (instead of four), as Sotnikova's step sequence elements in free skating didn't meet the requirements to get level four, and Kim's met the requirements enough to get level four. Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic champion, stated \\"I am stunned by this result, I don‚Äôt understand the scoring.\\" Several experts have also pointed out how Kim and Kostner's programs have significantly better artistry, choreography and skill on ice that should translate to higher component marks to other skaters. One judge in the scoresheets gave out significantly lower marks to Kim and Kostner in the component marks. Sonia Garbato, seven-time Olympic figure skating judge and former high-ranking ISU official, wrote: \\"No fair judge ‚Ä¶ could have awarded to Adelina higher marks in choreography, performance/execution, and interpretation of the music.\\" Four-time world champion Kurt Browning also expressed his surprise at the results, declaring that he did not understand how Kim and Sotnikova could have been so close in the programme component scores. He also pointed out how Sotnikova had her component scores boosted compared to her previous programs Michael Weiss, a two-time world bronze medalist, wrote \\"couldn't disagree more that Yuna and Sotnikova had basically same Component marks?..in Both short & long? Home field inflation.\\" Dick Button, two-time Olympic champion and longstanding skating analyst, commented: \\"Sotnikova was energetic, strong, commendable, but not a complete skater.\\" A petition in Change.org against the results of the event demanding an investigation and rejudgment has amassed over 2 million supporters breaking several web traffic records on the website. Athlete selection controversies Several controversial choices of the athletes going to the Olympics to represent countries have occurred. The participation of Lebanese alpine skier Jackie Chamoun became controversial in Lebanon after it was revealed at home in 2014 that she had posed in sexy photos for an Austrian calendar in 2011. A ministerial investigation has been mooted, while an online support protest \\"Strip for Jackie\\" has been organized. Chamoun has denied that she posed nude publicly on her Facebook page, saying that the behind the scenes images were not for publication. In South Korea, a furore has erupted over the loss of Viktor Ahn (Ahn Hyun-Soo) to Team Russia. Several newspapers reported the scorn of the Korean public and newspaper editors on the actions of the Korea Skating Union. The minister of sport and president of South Korea have both promised action in rooting out corruption and feuding at the organization that may have led to his \\"defection\\", in a bid to clean it up in preparation for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. The Korean public is generally supportive of Ahn. Selection of Ashley Wagner over Mirai Nagasu by the United States Olympic Team for ladies' singles figure skating caused some controversy, as at the selection competition, Nagasu finished ahead of Wagner. Wagner was selected on the body of her work, instead of the strength of her selection performance. The unclear selection process, and the fact that the second-place finisher Polina Edmunds had no international experience lead to some calls of racism, as the selection of Wagner over Nagasu was due to international results, while Edmunds' was not. This was the first time that the USFSA (United States Figure Skating Association) selected a skater who had competed in the selection trials and lost over another on who had also competed, previous times had done this only for skaters who had been injured and unable to compete at trials. Following the games in July, four Slovenian officials were suspended for four years from FIS after they helped to falsify times and rankings to allow alpine skier Vanessa Vanakorn (best known as the British violinist Vanessa-Mae and represented for Thailand as her father is a Thai) to achieve an average of 140 points of fewer at an FIS event to enable her to qualify for Olympics. At an FIS event in Krvavec, where she achieved her required score, she finished 6th (and last) in the national junior championships, despite being over 14 years older to the next eldest contestant. She also finished 7th (but last), 9th (of 13th) and 10th (of 13th). She finished with a total time of 3:26.97, 50.10 seconds behind the winner, Tina Maze of Slovenia. She was last among the finishers, ranking 67th. During investigations by FIS, it was revealed that the event was fixed to enable her to compete, for example a result including a competitor who was not present in the races, was placed 2nd in one race despite falling and her time was adjusted afterwards by more than 10 seconds, enabling a previously retired competitor who had the best FIS points in the competition to lower the penalty to benefit participants, failing to alter the course between runs and allowing the race to be run despite being suitable under regulations. As a result of taking part in a race rigged to her favor in an event orchestrated by her manager, Vanakorn was banned from skiing for four years. Pegasus Airlines Flight 751 On 7 February 2014, during the opening ceremony and one day after the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics, a man attempted to hijack Pegasus Airlines Flight 751 that was on a flight from Kharkiv, Ukraine, to Istanbul, Turkey, saying he had a bomb on board, and demanding to be flown to Sochi, the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The pilots turned off the inflight monitors and landed at Istanbul's Sabiha G√∂k√ßen Airport, fooling the man into thinking he was landing in Sochi. The plane, a Boeing 737-800 reg TC-CCP, was escorted to Istanbul by two Turkish F-16 fighter jets. The man, who appeared to be severely intoxicated, was detained by police and taken to the Istanbul Security Headquarters. In 2018, Russia's President Vladimir Putin admitted that he ordered the shooting down of a passenger plane that was reportedly carrying a bomb and targeting the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Environment XXII Olympic winter games in Sochi. The souvenir sheet of Russia, 2011 Despite several expert statements that the construction of Olympic venues in the buffer area of the UNESCO protected Caucasus Biosphere Reserve and Sochi National Park could be harmful, the IOC approved the plans. Greenpeace of Russia said that the IOC and the Russian Government assumed all responsibility for any damage to the West Caucasus natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to the Sochi bid, a wide array of construction was planned in the Grushevyi Ridge area. They included a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Mzymta River, sewage treatment facilities, a high-speed rail link, a Mountain Olympic Village, a track for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton (which was relocated in May 2009), and a biathlon venue. Alpine skiing venues were being constructed in the Rosa Khutor plateau and the Psekhako Ridge area. Environmentalists proposed building up Krasnaya Polyana instead of destroying nature reserve sites. Environmentalists also opposed the plan of construction of a cargo terminal for ships in the mouth of the Psou River in the Imereti Lowland, because this could lead to the destruction of the largest areas of sea-flooded shore and marshes. On 3 July 2008, Vladimir Putin directed some of the Olympic venues, such as the luge and bobsleigh track, to be relocated (the Russian National Sliding Centre was relocated in May 2009). He said \\"In setting our priorities and choosing between money and the environment, we're choosing the environment.\\" Geologist Sergei Volkov fled to Ukraine after speaking out about environmental and geological problems. He stated that mercury and uranium deposits, as well as the probability of landslides, made the location of the games hazardous. He also argued that the location of a cargo port was inappropriate. A storm there killed three seamen and destroyed $14 million of infrastructure. On 29 October 2013 it was reported that Russia broke its 'Zero Waste' Olympic Pledge, as it emerged that Russia's state-owned rail monopoly was dumping tons of construction waste into an illegal landfill, raising concerns of possible contamination in the water that directly supplies Sochi. Animal rights The issue of stray dogs has come up before the Olympics. On 3 February 2014, the city hired a firm to exterminate the stray population ‚Äì an approach that has brought international condemnation. These plans have been abandoned after complaints by local citizens. The stray dogs will be collected from the streets and put in a shelter. Russia originally planned to have two orca whales perform in the opening ceremonies of the Sochi 2014 Olympics. They were two of eight whales captured off the coast of Russia. After backlash by various advocacy groups and petitions signed by the general public, a statement was released that the whales would not be part of the Olympics. The current whereabouts of the whales are unknown. It was rumored that the committee had planned to have a dolphin trained to carry the Olympic torch. Activists spoke up about the issue immediately, causing the President of the Olympics Committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, to issue the statement that, \\"I confirm that we do not involve any orcas or dolphins for the Olympics.\\" Whether or not there had been any plans for a dolphin torchbearer has never been confirmed. Economy According to The New York Times the $50 billion or so lavished on Sochi is becoming a political liability. The stalling of the economy, despite the stimulus of Olympic spending, has raised worries about popular unrest directed at the Kremlin and a tightening of political freedoms in response once the Games are over. \\"It is about what Russia could have done with this money.\\" said Aleksei A. Navalny, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption. According to IRN.Ru analytical agency, prices for land, located next to the shoreline, reach $150,000 per 100 m¬≤, while price per square metre in average panel apartment building on the outskirts of the city already reaches $2000. \\"As a result of 2014 Olympics euphoria prices will rise annually by 15‚Äì20%,\\" speculates Irina Tyurina, press secretary of Russian Tourist Industry Union. This could lead to decrease in tourist interest to Sochi, which already has fallen below Anapa, Gelendzhik and Adler. After the IOC Evaluation Commission visited Sochi in February 2007, local authorities promised to buy the lands from Lower Imereti Bay long-time residents for a fair market price. But during the following half a year, no local resident could get their land approved as private property. While most Olympic Games have high cost overruns, for these Games they are much higher than usual. Much of the cost overruns have been blamed on corruption, with Boris Nemtsov claiming: \\"The Sochi Olympics are an unprecedented thieves' caper in which representatives of Putin's government are mixed up along with the oligarchs close to the government.\\" According to research by Transparency International, a global anti-corruption watchdog, approximately 50 percent or more of the building costs went to corruption. Poor workers conditions and rights have also been raised as an issue of concern, with at least 25 people dying and many more injured in accidents on sites in 2012 and with workers not getting paid at all. Circassians Taksim, ƒ∞stanbul Circassian organisations have also spoken out against the Olympics, arguing that the Games will take place on land that had been inhabited by them since the beginning of recorded history by their ancestors until 1864, when the resolution of the Russian‚ÄìCircassian War was stated to have caused the disappearance (variously by death or deportation) of 1.5 million Circassians, or 90-94% of the Circassian nation. They are demanding the Sochi 2014 Olympics be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologises for what the Circassians regard to be a genocide. Some Circassian groups have not expressed outright opposition to the Olympics but argue that symbols of Circassian history and culture should be included in the format, as Australia, the United States, and Canada did with their indigenous populations in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively. The games are viewed to be particularly offensive because they include the date of the 150th anniversary of what they consider a genocide. It has thus been a rallying cry for Circassian nationalists. In particular, there is much ire over the use of a hill called \\"Red Hill\\". In 1864, a group of Circassians apparently tried to return home but were attacked and a battle ensued, ending in their massacre, and attaining the name \\"Red Hill\\" (for the blood spilled). There were skiing and snowboarding events planned to be held on this hill. Political stability and governance The 2008 Russia‚ÄìGeorgia war, which broke out at the start of the 2008 Summer Olympics, surprised the Olympic community. \\"It is not what the world wants to see. It is contrary to what the Olympic ideal stands for\\", said an IOC spokesperson. However, in November 2008, the IOC turned down a request by the Georgian National Olympic Committee to reconsider its decision to hold the Olympics on the territory \\"adjacent both to the [Russian-]occupied Abkhaz conflict zone, and to the extremely unstable and volatile North Caucasus\\". Related concerns persist, regarding the region's safety and the desirability of hosting an Olympics in a conflict-ridden zone. \\"The region is such a muddied and bloodied aquarium of conflict that to pick out any one fish is impossible,\\" says Oleg Nechiporenko, chief analyst for Russia's National Anti- Terrorist and Anti-Criminal Fund, in response to a 26 May 2010, car bombing, whose suspects include Russian nationalists, local Russian mafia groups, separatists and Islamists in the North Caucasus, or a remnant of the war in Abkhazia. Sochi borders Russia's six autonomous North Caucasus republics, home of the Second Chechen War which allegedly face social problems. According to an article in Daily Telegraph, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, head of Saudi intelligence, allegedly confronted the Kremlin with a mix of inducements and threats in a bid to break the deadlock over Syria. This included security of winter olympics in Sochi if there is no accord. \\"I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,\\" he allegedly said. Russian Envoy to the North Caucasus Alexander Khloponin told local law enforcement that \\"the violent scramble for assets\\" is likely to get worse as Russia invests heavily in tourist infrastructure and Olympic-caliber ski resorts. =Safety= Three suicide bombings in Volgograd, one in October 2013 and the others in December 2013, have raised additional international concerns about security during the Olympics. The IOC expressed sympathy for the victims and underlined that they trusted that Russia's security arrangements for the Olympics would be adequate. The British, German, Italian, Hungarian, Austrian, Slovenian and Slovakian Olympic associations received threats that athletes would be \\"blown up\\" or kidnapped by terrorists at the Winter Games. According to the IOC, the letters did not represent any real threat. On 7 February 2014, during the opening ceremony, a Pegasus Airlines flight from Kharkiv, Ukraine, to Istanbul, Turkey, was threatened by a passenger who attempted to hijack the jetliner with a demand to be flown to Sochi. The man would be detained by police and taken into custody.  Media coverage  IOC President Thomas Bach criticized attempts to politicize the Games, saying that governments should not send political messages \\"on the backs of their athletes.\\" Benjamin Bidder of Spiegel Online and Julia Ioffe of The New Republic compared the negative pre-Sochi coverage to schadenfreude and Russophobia, while Anton Fedyashin of The Guardian blamed lingering Cold War mentalities for \\"dishing up a feast of negativity.\\" In an editorial published by The Nation, scholar of Russian studies Stephen F. Cohen criticized the \\"toxic coverage\\" for \\"exploiting the threat of terrorism so licentiously it seemed pornographic.\\" He further wrote that \\"American media on Russia today are less objective, less balanced, more conformist and scarcely less ideological than when they covered Soviet Russia during the Cold War.\\" According to The Guardian the games were more politicised than the before, serving as shameless promotion of Putin's Russia. While former world chess champion and Russian opposition figure Garry Kasparov said that game bolstered Putin's cult of personality. Comedians and satirical newspapers took advantage of the widespread pessimism. On 8 February, The Daily Currant posted a story alleging that a man responsible for operating the Olympic rings during the opening ceremony, which famously suffered a technical glitch, had been \\"found dead...with multiple stab wounds.\\" The fictional story went viral on social media. On 20 February, luger Kate Hansen posted a well- publicized video on her Twitter account allegedly showing a wolf roaming the hallways of her Sochi hotel; it was later revealed to be a hoax staged by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and Hansen. USA Luge officials distanced themselves from the incident, with spokesman Sandy Caligiore stating, \\"I can tell you that our organization is not happy with the incident. Sochi problems? Sochi fail? That's not USA Luge speaking.\\" Throughout the duration of the Olympics the @SochiProblems Twitter account had nearly 100,000 more followers than the official IOC feed @Sochi2014. The blog GossipSochi.com was later set up to debunk @SochiProblems postings, with many revealed to be fakes. In an interview, IOC supervisor Jean-Claude Killy stated that several hotels intended to house the foreign media were unfinished by the opening of the Olympics because officials realized \\"too late\\" that construction had fallen behind. According to David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, many of the incidents early in the Olympics were \\"standard problems\\" and were not unique to Sochi. Wallechinsky further noted, \\"When you mess up with the media before the Games start, you're going to have a problem.\\" In an interview that aired on Russian television on 24 February, Vladimir Putin opined that much of the criticism stemmed from rivalry in international politics, saying \\"There is a cohort of critics that are far from sport, they are engaged in a competitive struggle in international politics. They used this Olympic project to achieve their own objectives in the field of anti-Russian propaganda.\\" The mood greatly improved as the Games progressed. With a few notable exceptions, NBC largely avoided broadcasting negative material, although several segments deemed \\"overly friendly to Russia\\" were criticized by some U.S. commentators. Following the closing ceremony, Mark Sappenfield of The Christian Science Monitor concluded that by many measures the Olympics were \\"very successful.\\" Sappenfield singled out the organization as particularly good, writing that \\"Athletes and Olympic officials were nearly unanimous: This was an extraordinarily well run Olympics.\\" Thomas Bach also voiced support, stating \\"We saw excellent Games and what counts most is the opinions of the athletes and they were enormously satisfied...You have to ask all those who criticised whether they change their opinions now.\\" 2014 Russian Formula One Grand Prix In 2014, Sochi hosted the Russian Formula One Grand Prix. The circuit runs in and around the Sochi Olympic Park, which led to the IOC expressing concern that construction of the circuit could disrupt preparations for the Olympic Games. The IOC was granted the power to delay the inaugural race until 2015 to ensure the Olympics were held without disruption, but did not use it as competition was not disrupted. Countries choosing not to enter competitors A total of 91 nations qualified to compete at the Games. However, three nations chose not to send their athletes to the Games, even though they had met the international qualification standards. Puerto Rico is not sending Kristina Krone for the second consecutive time because the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee (COPUR) withdrew its recognition of the Puerto Rico Winter Sports Federation after the 2002 Winter Olympics due to an eligibility controversy involving a member of their bobsled team. According to COPUR president Sara Rosario, \\"Until there is a properly constituted winter sports federation with the requisite seriousness upon which we can consistently rely every four years, we cannot endorse (participation by Puerto Rico athletes in the Olympic Winter Games)\\". Krone has represented Puerto Rico since 2008 in more than 100 alpine ski competitions sanctioned by the International Ski Federation including the 2009, 2011 and 2013 World Alpine Ski Championships. South Africa would not enter skier Sive Speelman, who, although invited to compete by the IOC, did not meet the standards set by the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee. Algeria also chose not to enter its only competitor, Mehdi- Selim Khelifi, because he was the only one that managed to qualify, even though he was their only entry four years prior at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Independent participants There were three Independent Olympic participants from India who competed under the Olympics flag. In December 2012, the Indian Olympic Association was suspended by the IOC due to government interference in the autonomy and election of leaders, thus not complying with the Olympic charter. Fresh elections were due to take place after the opening ceremony so Indian athletes were scheduled to participate as independents. Course adjustments A crash in practice from Norwegian slopestyle snowboarder Torstein Horgmo, who fractured his collarbone, and complaints from other athletes that some jumps were too steep have prompted organizers to modify the slopestyle course in the week before the Games. A few days later the women's downhill ski training was stopped after the opening three racers were getting too much air on the jump down the home stretch. The International Ski Federation had workers adjusting the course making it smoother. Inadequate preparation of visitor facilities In the week prior to the start of the Games, reports began coming out of Sochi that a number of the accommodations for visitors and journalists were still incomplete. Several hotels meant to house visitors to the Games were reported to be still under construction upon arrival, as well as missing basic furniture from some of the rooms that had finished construction. The issues forced a number of visitors to seek alternate accommodations. Other problems reported included \\"piles of garbage\\" on the streets of the media village, as well as significant construction noise. Other notable incidents: * Johnny Quinn, member of the US bobsled team, became trapped in his bathroom and had to bash a hole in the door to get out. * Stacy St. Clair, Chicago Tribune reporter, reported that her hotel had no water, and that staff informed her that when it returned, not to wash her face in it as it was dangerous. The water service that returned provided murky dark water. The \\"dangerous face water\\" incident went viral. Use of mourning symbols During the women's 15-kilometre skiathlon four Norwegian skiers used black mourning binds in honor of teammate Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen's brother who had died unexpectedly on the opening day of the Olympics. IOC sent a reminder to the Norwegian Olympic Committee (NOC) that using mourning binds was not allowed during the games. IOC's letter caused protests in Norway and Sweden. NOC general secretary Inge Andersen met with IOC president Thomas Bach to discuss the matter on 10 February 2014. Norway's IOC member Gerhard Heiberg indicated that IOC would reconsider the ban against mourning binds. Freestyle skiers were told by IOC not to wear helmet stickers in memory of Sarah Burke, who died in an accident in 2012. However, many still did, and the rule was believed to not have been enforced. On 19 February Ukrainian athletes asked for and were refused permission by the IOC to wear black arm bands to honor those killed in the violent clashes in Kiev the previous day. According to IOC spokesman Mark Adams \\"They weren't forbidden to wear armbands. The Ukrainian NOC met with IOC officials informally yesterday. They discussed what should be done, and they reached the conclusion there were other ways of marking this moment. Some athletes have taken other views and other ways of doing things\\". IOC president Bach offered his condolences \\"to those who have lost loved ones in these tragic events\\". Athlete boycott On 19 February 2014 Ukrainian alpine skier Bohdana Matsotska refused to further participate in the Olympic Games in protest of the violent clashes in Kiev on the previous day. She and her father posted a message on Facebook stating \\"In solidarity with the fighters on the barricades of the Maidan, and as a protest against the criminal actions made towards the protesters, the irresponsibility of the president and his lackey government, we refuse further performance at the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014\\". On 20 February 2014 the Ukrainian NOC reported that as many as half of the 45 Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics had left the games to return home. But according to Ukrainian NOC president Sergey Bubka they had returned home in compliance with their original schedule, and their departure was thus not related to the riots in Kiev. Drug tests During the 2014 Winter Olympics, six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were sent home from the Games. On 21 February, skier Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle of Germany and Italian bobsleigh brakeman William Frullani were both sent home from Sochi after failing drugs tests. They both tested positive for methylhexanamine. On 22 February, Ukrainian cross-country skier Marina Lisogor was tested positive for trimetazidine and Latvian ice hockey player Vitalijs Pavlovs tested positive for methylhexaneamine. On 23 February, Austrian skier Johannes D√ºrr tested positive for EPO and Swedish ice hockey player Nicklas B√§ckstr√∂m tested positive for a substance found in an allergy medication. Men's freestyle skiing ‚Äì ski cross Both Canada and Slovenia appealed separately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport that the three French athletes in the Big Final of the men's ski cross final had their pants illegally changed by their coach. They argued it gave the three an aerodynamic advantage over the rest of the field. Both countries first appealed to the International Ski Federation, but were rejected since they appealed hours after the end of the competition (when the deadline was 15 minutes after the close of the race). The appeal to the court was ultimately unsuccessful as well, because the court agreed with the ski federation that the appeal was filed past the deadline. Russian Mafia used to threaten rival campaign allegations The Russian mafia helped Russia win the games by threatening the Salzburg campaign leader Fedor Radmann, who later resigned in 2007, according to German security officials. Informants observed a meeting between mafia leaders and Russian government foreign policy advisor Sergei Prikhodko in 2006 in a Munich restaurant to discuss the Olympic selection process. Radmann himself denies he ever met any Russian mobsters but his colleagues state that he feared for his life, and the mayor of Salzburg Heinz Schaden confirms the link.

The Sande society is a secret women's association found in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea that initiates girls into adulthood, confers fertility, instills notions of morality and proper sexual comportment, and maintains an interest in the well-being of its members throughout their lives. In addition, Sande champions women's social and political interests and promotes their solidarity vis-a-vis the Poro society, a complementary institution for men. Today this social institution is found among the Bassa, Gola, Kissi, Kpelle, Loma, Mano and Vai of Liberia. Throughout the region, the complementarity of men's and women's gender roles ‚Äì evident in such diverse activities as farming, cloth production, and musical performances ‚Äì reach full expression. The women's Sande and men's Poro associations alternate political and ritual control of \\"the land\\" (a concept embracing the natural and supernatural worlds) for periods of three and four years respectively. During Sande's sovereignty, all signs of the men's society are banished.[Leopold, Robert S.

The alternating three- and four-year initiation cycles for women and men respectively are one example of the widespread use of the numbers 3 and 4 to signify the gender of people, places and events; together the numbers equal seven, a sacred number throughout the region.[Leopold, Robert S.

Suteuphaa succeeded his father Sukaphaa, who laid the foundation of Ahom kingdom in Assam. His reign was characterized by the expansion of his father‚Äôs kingdom. He also had conflicts with the Shans or Naras of Mungkang, a Shan kingdom in Upper Burma. Ancestry and accession Suteuphaa was the eldest son of Ahom king Sukaphaa. After a reign of 39 years, Sukaphaa died in 1268 CE. The nobles installed Suteuphaa as the new king of Ahom kingdom.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta page 79 After his accession, Suteuphaa sent embassy to the ancestral homeland of Sukaphaa, informing its ruler Sukhranphaa, the brother of Sukaphaa, about the demise of Sukaphaa and his accession to the throne. Sukhranphaa sent gifts to Suteuphaa consisting of caps made of gold and silver and two specially designed bows, congratulating his coronation as the king of Ahom kingdom.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati page 24 Reign =Expansion of the kingdom= Suteuphaa desired to expand his father‚Äôs kingdom. Therefore, in order to fulfill his desire, he came in conflicts with the Kacharis residing in the neighbouring region. At that time, many parts of Upper Assam were inhabited by the Kacharis, though it was not known whether all the Kachari tribes were part of the same kingdom. He forced the Kacharis to abandon the country which lies to the east of Dikhou river.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta page 79 One of the Ahom Buranji or historical document describes the event in an interesting way. Suteuphaa claimed the track east of Dikhou river as his own. The local Kachari inhabitants opposed his claim. Instead of resorting to warfare, both sides decided to solve this matter in a peaceful way. The Ahom challenged the Kacharis to build a canal from their settlement to Dikhou river within a duration of one night. If the Kacharis successfully complete the work within allotted time, the track will be theirs otherwise it would come under Ahom rule. The Kacharis accepted the challenge. They worked on the construction of the canal and were on the verge of completing it when the Ahoms resorted to tricks. On Suteuphaa‚Äôs personal instruction, some Ahom soldiers were hiding in the forest near the construction site. Each soldier had one rooster along with them. Seeing that the Kacharis were on the verge of completing the canal, the Ahom soldiers hiding in the forest, made the roosters to cock. Since it was full moon night, the Kacharis could not determine the actual time and they believed that they have lost the bet since cocking of rooster signifies morning. The Kacharis abandoned the track, and the Ahoms immediately occupied it.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati page 24 =Conflict with Mungkang= It is related in one Buranji or Chronicle that there was a war between the Naras or Shans of Mungkang, and the king of Mantara or Burma. The Naras were defeated and they appealed for help from Suteuphaa, as the ruler of Mungkang and Suteuphaa‚Äôs father king Sukaphaa shares the same branch of Shan tribes. The rulers of Mungkang and the Ahom kings used to communicate with each other as Brother King. In all ancient Ahom chronicles, the Naras or the Shans of Mungkang are regarded by the Ahoms as their close kinsmen. In reply to the appeal for help made by the ruler of Mungkang, Suteuphaa stated that if the Nara king of Mungkang agrees to give his daughter in marriage with Suteuphaa, then he would send a force for the assistance of Mungkang. The Nara king declined to do so. A quarrel ensued and Suteuphaa sent an expedition against the Naras, but his troops suffered defeat and the Burhagohain, who commanded them, were defeated. The Borgohain was promptly dispatched with a second force, but, instead of fighting, he came to terms with the enemy. On his return, he was disgraced and imprisoned. He was subsequently forgiven on the intercession of the other nobles.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta page 79 Some Ahom historians claimed that no conflict occurred between Ahoms and Naras, during the reign of Suteuphaa and the incident described above happened during the reign of Sukhaamphaa or Khora Raja.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati page 75 Death and legacy Suteuphaa died in 1281 CE. Among his four sons, the eldest son Subinphaa succeeded him as the king of Ahom kingdom. Suteuphaa followed the policy of expansion of his father‚Äôs kingdom. The manner in which he outwits the Kacharis and conquered the country which lies east to the Dikhou river, reveals that he had inherited his father, the king Sukaphaa‚Äôs wits and intelligence. The policy of expansion of Ahom kingdom will be followed by the later Ahom rulers and almost the entire Brahmaputra valley would come under their rule.

He was appointed by President Mohamed Morsi following the 2011 revolution and the 2012 presidential election on 12 August 2012. He was Egypt's first vice president from a civilian background rather than a military one. He resigned from his post on 22 December 2012. Early life and education Mekki was born in Alexandria in 1954. After graduating from police college in Cairo he worked as a police officer in Central Security Forces. He then got a bachelor's degree in law and worked in general prosecution (). A few years later, Mekki became a judge. Working his way up the judicial ladder, he was eventually appointed vice-president of the Court of Cassation (Arabic: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÉŸÖŸá ÿßŸÑŸÜŸÇÿ∂)., which represents the final stage of criminal appeal in Egypt. He is younger brother of Ahmed Mekki, the former minister of justice in the Qandil Cabinet. Career Since the mid-1980s, Mekki, along with a large number of Egypt's judges, were engaged in advocating judicial independence, an idea which was brought to light at the time by Yehia Rifai, Chairman of the Egyptian Judges' Club at the time. Brothers Ahmed and Mahmoud Makky alongside Hossam Ghariani and others were demanding separation of the executive authority over courts and the transfer of judicial inspection to the Supreme judicial Council. Makky headed the follow-up elections in the Judges' Club, and coordinator of the movement of the independent judges. In 2006, he led demonstrations for independence of the judiciary from the executive. Makky also demanded the amendment of article 76 of the Egyptian constitution to allow multiple presidential candidates to run for elections. In 1992, Makky headed a strike by judges to request the release of two judges who they claimed had been unfairly detained. In 2005, Makky was arrested and tried. During the trial of Makky in 2005, the Muslim Brotherhood showed intense solidarity with him during the trial. Salim Al-Awa and a large number of lawyers pleaded with him. In 2006, he was cleared of the charge. Makky had a popular position in 2006 when he surprised the judges and the broad masses huddled in front of the High Court after the end of the first session of the disciplinary trial for Makky and ran quickly towards Major General Ismail Shaer, director of Cairo security. He held him by his hands and said to him \\"Do you know Omar?\\", Shaer replied \\"Yes, he is my late son,\\" Makky replied \\"If you really remember him, then pray from him and stop police brutality against youth demonstrators since they are all the same age of your late son.\\" People who saw the incident said that Shaer nearly cried while he listened to these words. In 2010, he moved to Kuwait, and was appointed vice-president of Kuwait's Court of Cassation. He returned to Egypt in August 2012 upon the proposal by President Morsi to be his deputy. On 22 December 2012, Mekki resigned from his post, stating that \\"I have realized a while ago that the nature of politics does not suit my professional background as a judge.\\" The post of vice presidency of Egypt was also abolished after the constitutional referendum in December 2012. However, after the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi in the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, the position of the Vice President was briefly restored by Acting President Adly Mansour, who appointed Mohamed ElBaradei to the post of Acting Vice President on 7 July 2013. After his resignation Makky assumed the role of the chairman of a national dialogue forum to consolidate political forces with the Qandil cabinet.

He is also a writer and translator and was briefly in Bosnian politics in the 2000s. Although born in Macedonia, he has been living in Sarajevo since 1975. Muharem Serbezovski emerged as a singer in the 1960s, having released his first album at only 12. He became one of the most popular Romani singers in Yugoslavia and reached a wide popularity in the 1970s and 1980s. He has released 12 albums and 22 singles and extended plays. His main inspiration is Romani music but he has widely explored and blended other styles, especially Turkish music. Since the 1980s, Serbezovski has established himself as a writer and translator, having written several books and translated the Quran into Romani language. Known for his Romani activism, he served a term as a member of the Bosnian parliament in the 2000s. Early life and background Muharem Serbezovski was born on May 2, 1950 in Topaana, the oldest Romani settlement of Skopje, at that time capital of the People's Republic of Macedonia. His family belonged to the local Romani minority and included 11 members. His father was an imam and gave him a great interest for Islam and its culture. Because his parents were poor, he had to start singing at a young age to earn money. Singing career Muharem Serbezovski released his first single at 12 in 1962, Kalajƒëiljar Kalaj Japar. It contained songs in Turkish. He rose to fame in the late 1960s, thanks to the help of Stevo Teodosievski, a folk composer and director of a Romani ensemble, and his wife Esma Red≈æepova, herself a Roma singer. He was not their only prot√©g√© as they also encouraged other local Roma artists. Serbezovski started to experience a wide success in 1968, at the age of 18, following the release of his second single. It included two songs, D≈æemile and Gili e halisake, the first being in Serbo-Croatian, the other in Romani. These two tracks feature another friend of the Teodosievski couple, the clarinettist Medo ƒåun. They also show the ornamented style of singing and the Turkish influence which have characterised the singer through his career. In 1969, Serbezovski left Skopje, as did most of the local Romani artists. He first followed Stevo and Esma to Belgrade, at that time the capital city of Yugoslavia and its main cultural hub. However, he moved to the smaller city of Sarajevo in 1975 and has been living there ever since. The Bosnian capital was then experiencing a rich cultural life and the singer was attracted to its cosmopolitan and Eastern atmosphere. Such a decision may also have been made for the singer to differentiate himself from Esma Red≈æepova. Her style was inspired by mainstream pop music and the Indian Romani heritage, while Serbezovski wanted to develop a music closer to Turkish and Arabic cultures. Nonetheless, Muharem Serbezovski always tried to reach a wide audience and also explored various kinds of music, including Indian music. At that time, Yugoslavia and India were both part of the Non-Aligned Movement and Josip Broz Tito exploited the Indian origin of the Romani people to get the two countries closer. Indian cinema in particular was very popular among Yugoslav Romas. Several of Serbezovski's songs show such an influence, primarily Ramu, Ramu and Ramajana, both released in 1974. The first one makes reference to a character of the eponymous Indian film, the latter refers to a Hindu epic poem, Ramayana. Muharem Serbezovski went to India in 1978 to attend the Roma festival in Chandigarh. On this occasion, he met the prime minister Indira Gandhi and posed with her son Rajiv Gandhi dressed in the same Indian costume to highlight the resemblance between Indian and Roma peoples. Besides his artistic connection to Stevo Teodosievski and Esma Red≈æepova, Muharem Serbezovski has also worked with other Yugoslav pop-folk artists, including his own brother, Ajnur Serbezovski, with whom he released a single in 1976 and an album in 1982. He also worked with his favourite musician, the late Toma Zdravkoviƒá, with whom he toured for 7‚Äì8 years, and with Sinan Sakiƒá. Although he has always been proud of his Romani origin, Muharem Serbezovski has released only few songs in Romani language. Most of his work is sung in Serbo- Croatian. During the Bosnian War, he fully identified as a Bosnian and sang many war songs. Literature Muharem Serbezovski defines himself as one of the few Romani intellectuals. He is responsible for the first Romani translation of the Qur'an and is himself an author, having penned several novels and poems. He started his career as a writer and translator in the 1980s when he continued the work of his father, who had started to translate the Qur'an into Romani. Serbezovski also has plans to translate the Old and New Testament, Hadiths and some well-known literary works (War and Peace, Crime and Punishment and One Hundred Years of Solitude) into Romani. Serbezovski's first novel, ≈†areni dijamanti (\\"coloured diamonds\\"), was published in 1983. It was followed by Cigani A kategorije (\\"First-class Gypsies\\") in 1985, Za de≈æjem pride sonce : dva romana (\\"With rain comes the sun: two novels\\") in 1986, and his volume of poetry, Nitko ne zna puteve vjetrova i Cigana (\\"No one knows the road of winds and Gyspies\\") in 1999. He also published an essay, Cigani i ljudska prava (\\"Gypsies and human rights\\") in 2000. His fictional works revolve on Romani identity and are for him a way to write about his own culture. For him, his work gives a much more authentic insight on Roma people than novels from non-Romani writers, who usually use Romani characters only to set up an atmosphere. Politics Serbezovski briefly involved himself in Bosnian politics in the 2000s. His political career was closely linked to his Romani activism and his own assimilation to Bosnian culture. He joined Haris Silajd≈æiƒá's Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Bosniak party, and was elected a member of the Bosnian parliament in 2007 for a 4-year term. He never intended to become a professional politician but wanted to represent Roma people on the Bosnian political scene. His time as a member of parliament was tarnished by a declaration on battered women. In 2009, he said he considered that violence against women was normal and part of the Balkan tradition, and caused outrage among the public and the Bosnian NGO sector. He resigned from his political party in 2010 citing discrimination from the leaders of the group.

Only a year later, she returned to rowing and was part of the women's eight that unsuccessfully tried to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics; at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich, Germany, they came ninth, and at both the first two World Rowing Cup regattas in 2008, the team came eighth. In World Rowing Cup regattas in 2010, she competed in women's quadruple sculls with Emma Feathery, Paula Twining, and Louise Trappitt, and they came sixth in Munich, Germany, and in Lucerne, Switzerland. At the 2010 World Rowing Championships at Lake Karapiro, New Zealand, she rowed in the women's double sculls with Feathery and placed seventh. At the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia, she teamed up with Anna Reymer in the women's double sculls and won bronze. She competed in double sculls with Reymer at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, where they placed fifth. Paterson retired after the 2012 Summer Olympics and moved to Christchurch, where she worked as a rowing coach and physical education teacher at Rangi Ruru Girls' School while completing a post-graduate teaching diploma at the city's New Zealand Graduate School of Education. In 2015, Paterson made a comeback and was selected by Rowing New Zealand to be part of the 57-strong training squad from which the nine boat teams will be chosen. At the New Zealand national championships at Lake Karapiro on 16 February 2016, Paterson competed with Rebecca Scown in the women's coxless pair, and they were beaten by Emma Dyke and Grace Prendergast for second place.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1990 to November 1991 she ran eleven times winning five races and being placed five times. Shadayid was one of the leading two-year-old fillies in Europe in 1990, winning all three of her races including the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at the Longchamp. After winning the Fred Darling Stakes on her three-year-old debut, Shadayid took her unbeaten run to five by winning the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket. Although she never won again, she finished second in the Coronation Stakes and the Sussex Stakes and third in the Haydock Sprint Cup and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Shadayid was retired from racing to become a broodmare at the end of her three-year-old season after finishing seventh in the Breeders' Cup Mile. Background Shadayid was a grey filly bred in Kentucky by her owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud. Shadayid was one of the best horses sired by Shadeed who won the 2000 Guineas and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1985. Shadayid inherited her grey coat from her dam, the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Desirable and was a half sister of Dumaani, the double winner of the Keeneland Breeders Cup Stakes. As a granddaughter of the broodmare Balidaress, Shadayid was closely related to many successful Thoroughbreds including the 1000 Guineas winner Russian Rhythm and Cape Cross, the sire of Sea the Stars. The filly was trained throughout her career by John Dunlop at Arundel, West Sussex. She was ridden in all but one of her races by Willie Carson. Racing career =1992: two-year-old season= Shadayid began her racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Ascot Racecourse in June. She started 13/8 favourite and won by six lengths. After a break of three months, Shadayid returned to Ascot for the Kensington Palace Stakes over seven furlongs. She started odds-on favourite and recorded a three and a half length win without being asked for a serious effort (\\"hard held\\"). Nine days after her second Ascot win, Shadayid was stepped up in class for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp. Carson sent the grey filly into the lead in the straight and she quickly went clear of her opponents to win by two lengths from the future Prix de Diane winner Caerlina. The unplaced horses included Magic Night and Jet Ski Lady who went on to win the Prix Vermeille and The Oaks respectively. =1993: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Shadayid was sent to Newbury for the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas. Her opponents included the Lowther Stakes winner Only Yours and the Cherry Hinton Stakes winner Chicarica. Shadayid started 8/11 favourite and won comfortably by three lengths. Two weeks later, Shadayid started 4/6 favourite for the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. Her closest rival in the betting was the Luca Cumani-trained Crystal Gazing, a filly who had won the Rockfel Stakes and the Nell Gwyn Stakes. Carson restrained the filly in the early stages before moving forward in the second half of the race. Shadayid took the lead inside the final furlong and went clear to win by two lengths from the Irish-trained Kooyonga, with Crystal Gazing third. A month after her Newmarket victory, Shadayid was moved up in distance to contest her second Classic, the Oaks, over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. The race produced an upset result, with Jet Ski Lady, a 50/1 outsider, leading for most of the race and winning by ten lengths, with Shadayid tiring in the closing stages to lose her unbeaten record as she finished third. Eleven days after the Oaks, Shadayid returned to a mile for the Coronation Stakes] at Royal Ascot where she was matched against Kooyonga, who had won the Irish 1,000 Guineas since her defeat at Newmarket, and the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Danseuse du Soir. Shadayid was in third place entering the straight and appeared to have every chance but was beaten three quarters of a length into second by Kooyonga. In July, Shadayid ran against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. She started 9/4 favourite and finished second of the eight runners behind Second Set. In September, the filly was brought back in distance for the Sprint Cup over six furlongs at Haydock Park. Racing against specialist sprinters she finished third behind Polar Falcon and Sheikh Albadou. On her final European start, Shadayid led until the final furlong before finishing third to Selkirk and Kooyonga in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot, with Second Set fourth and Hector Protector in sixth. Shadayid's final appearance came in November when she was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs. She started a 22/1 outsider and finished seventh of the fourteen runners behind Opening Verse. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Shadayid an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. The main yearling farm at Shadwell Stud's Lexington headquarters is named in honour of Shadayid. John Dunlop said of Shadayid: \\"She was a remarkably versatile filly. She won the 1,000 Guineas, was placed in the Oaks and was then placed in the Haydock Sprint, which was quite extraordinary. She was top-class\\", while Willie Carson called her \\"a very, very good filly\\". Stud record Shadayid retired from racing to become a broodmare for Shadwell Stud. She produced several winners including Bint Shadayid (sired by Nashwan) who won the Prestige Stakes and finished third in the 1995 1000 Guineas and Imtiyaz (by Woodman), a colt who won at Listed level and finished second in the Group One Prix Jean Prat, before retiring to stud in India.

Under Dr Zacharie's leadership a Grand Council was formed in 1887, and the ritual was expanded to include two extra degrees, one of which pertained to the chair of Supreme Ruler. The degree gained in popularity, however, unfortunately for Dr Zacharie, the Grand Council for the Allied Masonic Degrees had empowered their American body (or a similar name) to confer their version of the degree. This resulted in the Allied Grand Council denouncing the Grand Council of the Order of the Secret Monitor, and attempting to assume sole jurisdiction over the degree. However, in 1931 an arrangement was reached between the two orders, which saw the degree of the Order of the Secret Monitor being transferred from the Allied group of degrees. The Order is sometimes known as the Brotherhood of David and Jonathan. A Benevolent Fund was formed in 1901. Qualification for membership All Master Masons are eligible for membership of this Order, but must be invited from a member. Ancient and Masonic Order of the Scarlet Cord The Ancient and Masonic Order of the Scarlet Cord was at one time, an inner appendent order, of which all those who had taken their second degree were eligible for membership. The order was developed in the UK in 1889, and there are six classes or grades of membership. The first three grades meet in a consistory. In 2010, the order was re-established as a separate Masonic order in its own right. The current Grand Summus is Ian Currans. Structure and organisation The Order meets in Conclaves, each with a Supreme Ruler at its head. There are three degrees in the order, as practised in the UK. The first degree, the Secret Monitor in which the legend of David and Jonathan is acted out in the ceremony of induction. The second degree, Prince, the admission ceremony is derived from the Book of Samuel in the Old Testament. The third degree, is the ceremony of installation of Supreme Ruler, and is normally carried out once a year at the installation meeting.Jackson, Keith B (2002) Beyond the Craft Hersham: Lewis Masonic, The Order is administrated from Mark Masons' Hall, London.https://markmasonshall.org/orders/secret- monitor References Category:Masonic organizations ","title":"Order of the Secret Monitor"},{"id":"36703796","text":"Henry R.

Low was a Judge and Surrogate of the Sullivan County Court from 1857 to 1861. He was a member of the New York State Senate (9th D.) in 1862 and 1863. In November 1863, Low ran for re-election, but his former law partner Niven was declared elected. Low contested Niven's election, and was seated in the State Senate for the 88th Session on January 17, 1865. He was re-elected in 1865, and continued in the Senate in 1866 and 1867. Afterwards he resumed his law practice in Middletown, Orange County, New York. In 1882, he ran for Congress in the 15th District, but was defeated by Democrat John H. Bagley Jr. Low was again a member of the State Senate (13th D.) from 1884 until his death, sitting in the 107th, 108th, 109th, 110th and 111th New York State Legislatures.

She was then transferred to the 11th flotilla for operations on 1 November 1944. She made the short journey from Kiel in Germany to Horten Naval Base in Norway, arriving on 18 November 1944. =Patrol and loss= U-297s only patrol began from Horten; it took her through the 'gap' between the Faroe and the Shetland Islands. She was sunk by a Sunderland flying boat of No. 201 Squadron RAF on 6 December 1944, west of Yesnaby in the Orkney Islands. =Previously recorded fate and wreck discovery= U-297 was originally thought to have been sunk on 6 December 1944 by depth charges dropped by the British frigates and . She had also been listed as missing since 3 January 1945 probably in the Pentland Firth. The wreck of U-297 was found and identified in May 2000. It lies at a depth of .

Limestone was extracted there from 1835 to 1952 for lime burning at lime kilns to produce quicklime. The quarry was used by the Royal Air Force as a chemical weapons storage depot during the Second World War, the largest such depot in the United Kingdom. Afterwards a number of captured German chemical munitions were disposed of at the site by burning, which was only partially successful. The RAF depot closed in 1960 and the site is now vacant. A small part of the abandoned quarry has flooded to become a quarry lake. Its water has a very high pH, that is, it is very alkaline, owing to the presence of caustic chemicals that are leaching from the waste left from the lime burning. The lake water has a vivid blue colour due to the scattering of light by finely dispersed particles of calcium carbonate. Despite signs warning of the health risks the lake became a popular tourist destination and swimming spot. The local High Peak Borough Council dyed the water black in 2013, 2016 and 2020 in an attempt to deter swimmers.  History  The site near Harpur Hill, south of Buxton, was worked as a limestone quarry. Small-scale lime burning had taken place near Harpur Hill since at least the 1600s, initially around Grin Low near Poole's Cavern to the north, using lime kilns to produce quicklime by calcinating the limestone (mainly Bee Low Limestones) quarried nearby (that is, heating calcium carbonate to produce calcium oxide). A site beside the quarry was used for large-scale lime production from around 1835 to around 1952, using larger shaft kilns and then a multi-chambered Hoffmann kiln, operated by Buxton Lime Firms Ltd (later Brunner Mond from 1918, and then ICI from 1926). The Hoffmann lime kiln was demolished in 1980 to create space for an industrial estate. Large volumes of solid waste from the lime burning were dumped in tips nearby, creating spoil heaps contaminated with traces of quicklime and with ash from the coal used in the process. Water percolating through the waste leaches calcium hydroxide and becomes alkaline.\\"The Harpur Hill Site: its geology, evolutionary history and a catalogue of materials present\\" A.E. Mildowski, R.P. Shaw and D.I. Stewart, 2013. British Geological Survey Commissioned Report, CR/13/104 The site was taken over by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1938 for use as a depot for the storage of chemical weapons. Poor weather delayed construction and the depot did not become operational until 1940. During the Second World War it was the largest chemical weapons storage depot in the country, covering some . After the war the site was occupied by an RAF unexploded ordnance disposal unit, known as an X station, and used for storage and disarmament of captured German chemical weapons and V-rocket warheads. The RAF disposed of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and phosgene, by burning it with bleach on the surrounding hills. This proved unsustainable, as large quantities of smoke were produced and the destruction was incomplete. Some mustard gas escaped as a vapour and much of the nearby vegetation was killed. The site also housed an RAF Mountain Rescue team who attended air crashes across Derbyshire. The RAF depot closed down in 1960.  Blue lagoon  A quarry lake, officially known as Hoffman Quarry but also known as the Blue Lagoon, at the site became a tourist attraction owing to its vivid turquoise-blue coloration. It has attracted visitors from across the country. The colour derives from the scattering of light by small particles of calcium carbonate that are precipitating within the water. The caustic quicklime dissolved in the water gives it a pH level of 11.3 (by comparison bleach has a pH of 12.3). Signs at the site state the water can cause \\"skin and eye irritations, stomach problems and fungal infections such as thrush\\" and that the quarry is known to contain car wrecks, dead animals, excrement and rubbish. The water is also extremely cold. Despite this the lake continued to be a popular destination visited by hundreds of people. Around 750 local people, concerned about the health risks, signed a petition to have the quarry drained and closed off. However the water was deemed too toxic to drain, as it would risk contaminating local water supplies. In order to deter swimmers the water was dyed black in 2013 by High Peak Borough Council, who acted after being unable to get in touch with the site's owner. The dye wore off by 2015 and the water returned to a blue coloration. The council redyed the lake in 2016 with a stronger mixture, but by October 2019 it showed signs of returning to a blue colour. In March 2020 the lake was dyed again following reports of people gathering there despite social distancing instructions issued by the British government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. It was redyed by High Peak Borough Council and Derbyshire Fire and Rescue on 29 May after people flocked to the site for the bank holiday weekend (25 May). The police also coned off potential parking spaces in Harpur Hill. With people continuing to visit the site local farmers attempted to deter them by spreading pig and cow slurry across the surrounding land on 19 June 2020.  Incidents  Derbyshire Police found the body of a 44-year-old man at the quarry on 18 February 2019. The death was found not to be suspicious. On 29 September 2019 two firefighters from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service were injured whilst carrying out rope rescue training at the quarry. One of them was hospitalised with life-changing injuries.

It had five stories. It was expanded by a duplicate building to the north in 1914, and further expanded by addition of 5 more stories in 1917. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2008. According to its NRHP nomination, the building \\"is one of Tulsa's earliest business/office buildings\\". and The Tulsa Preservation Commission has stated that it is \\"...the oldest of Tulsa‚Äôs existing oil business buildings.\\" History The Mayo Brothers, who had established a thriving furniture business in 1904, had already moved to a larger rented building on Main Street in 1906, then decided they needed still more space, which they began constructing at 420 South Main in 1909. They used half the space for their own business and rented the rest of the building as offices for oil companies. As the demand for office space increased, the Mayos built an identical five story building at 418 South Main in 1914. In 1917, they added five more stories to each structure, and operated them as one building. Profits from the Mayo Building financed later additions to the Mayo real estate empire: the Petroleum Building in 1921, the Mayo Hotel in 1925 and the Mayo Motor Inn in 1950. On October 24, 1917, a fire at the building claimed the lives of two firefighters from the Tulsa Fire Department. Ross Shepard, 29 years old and Ben Hanes, 27 years old, were taken to their death when a stairway they were fighting fire from collapsed. They were the first two deaths in the line of duty from the department and remain, to this day, the only two to have been killed in a structure fire since the department was founded in 1905. The building has now been converted to loft apartment use.

Ngo\\"Concentration-of-measure inequalities\\" by G√°bor Lugosi The inequality states that : \\\\Pr(X-\\\\mathbb{E}[X]\\\\ge\\\\lambda)\\\\quad\\\\begin{cases} \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\sigma^2 + \\\\lambda^2} & \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda > 0, \\\\[8pt] \\\\ge 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\sigma^2 + \\\\lambda^2} & \\\\text{if }\\\\lambda < 0\\\\. \\\\end{cases} where :X is a real-valued random variable, :\\\\Pr is the probability measure, :\\\\mathbb{E}[X] is the expected value of X, :\\\\sigma^2 is the variance of X.

While the inequality is often attributed to Francesco Paolo Cantelli who published it in 1928,Cantelli, F. P. (1928), \\"Sui confini della probabilita,\\" Atti del Congresso Inter- nazional del Matematici, Bologna, 6, 47-5 it originates in Chebyshev's work of 1874.Ghosh, B.K., 2002. Probability inequalities related to Markov's theorem. The American Statistician, 56(3), pp.186-190 The Chebyshev inequality implies that in any data sample or probability distribution, \\"nearly all\\" values are close to the mean in terms of the absolute value of the difference between the points of the data sample and the weighted average of the data sample. The Cantelli inequality (sometimes called the \\"Chebyshev‚ÄìCantelli inequality\\" or the \\"one- sided Chebyshev inequality\\") gives a way of estimating how the points of the data sample are bigger than or smaller than their weighted average without the two tails of the absolute value estimate. The Chebyshev inequality has \\"higher moments versions\\" and \\"vector versions\\", and so does the Cantelli inequality. Proof * Case \\\\lambda > 0: Let X be a real-valued random variable with finite variance \\\\sigma^2 and expectation \\\\mu, and define Y = X - \\\\mathbb{E}[X] (so that \\\\mathbb{E}[Y] = 0 and \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\\\sigma^2). Then, for any u\\\\geq 0, we have : \\\\Pr( X-\\\\mathbb{E}[X]\\\\geq\\\\lambda) = \\\\Pr( Y \\\\geq \\\\lambda) = \\\\Pr( Y + u \\\\geq \\\\lambda + u) \\\\leq \\\\Pr( (Y + u)^2 \\\\geq (\\\\lambda + u)^2 ) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{E}[(Y + u)^2] }{(\\\\lambda + u)^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2 + u^2 }{(\\\\lambda + u)^2}. the last inequality being a consequence of Markov's inequality. As the above holds for any choice of u\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}, we can choose to apply it with the value that minimizes the function u \\\\geq 0 \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2 + u^2 }{(\\\\lambda + u)^2}. By differentiating, this can be seen to be u_\\\\ast = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\lambda}, leading to : \\\\Pr( X-\\\\mathbb{E}[X] \\\\geq\\\\lambda) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2 + u_\\\\ast^2 }{(\\\\lambda + u_\\\\ast)^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\lambda^2 + \\\\sigma^2} if \\\\lambda > 0 * Case \\\\lambda < 0: we proceed as before, writing \\\\alpha = -\\\\lambda > 0 and for any u \\\\geq 0 : \\\\Pr( X-\\\\mathbb{E}[X]< \\\\lambda) = \\\\Pr( -Y > \\\\alpha) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\alpha^2 + \\\\sigma^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\lambda^2 + \\\\sigma^2} using the previous derivation on -Y.

It lived during the Toyonian stage (last phase of the Upper Olenellus-zone), in what is today the South-Western United States. Emigrantia can easily be distinguished from other trilobites by the sturdy but not inflated genal spines, that are attached at midlength of the cephalon, in combination with effaced features of the raised axial area of the head shield (or glabella).  Etymology  The name of the genus is derived from Emigrant Pass, Nopah Range, California, near the collection site of many of the last of the Lower Cambrian Olenellina.  Description  As with most early trilobites, Emigrantia has an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified. As part of the Olenellina suborder, Emigrantia lacks dorsal sutures. Like all other members of the Olenelloidea superfamily, the eye- ridges spring from the back of the frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon, that is called glabella. The exoskeleton of Emigrantia is inverted egg-shaped in outline and up to 3 cm in length, disregarding the genal spines and the pleural spines of the 3rd thorax segment. The head shield (or cephalon) is approximately pentagonal, with the right and left frontal margin together forming a circle segment. It has a distinct cephalic border that is developed as a raised ridge. The genal spines are stout, up to 2 mm in diameter near the base and appear to be massive. They are attached about half length of the cephalon and bend quickly to proceed to their tip parallel to the midline. Intergenal angle strongly rounded, from perpendicular to the midline angling to 135¬∞-150¬∞. The glabella is of approximately constant width along its length, and the furrows are indistinct. The thorax has at least 12 segments, but probably a few more. The tips of the pleural lobes point backwards, but except for the third segment, these are not spiny. The 3rd segment is macropleural. = Differences with some other Biceratopsinae = Biceratops nevadensis and Peachella share extremely effaced cephalic features with Emigrantia. Biceratops however lacks genal spines. In Peachella the genal spines are short and bloated, in contrast with being longer than the cephalon and attached halfway down its side (or lateral margin). Eopeachella has short genal spines with only the basis inflated and less effaced cephalic features.  Distribution  Emigrantia is known only from the Lower Cambrian of California (Carrara Formation, Thimble Limestone Member, Nopah Range, Inyo County).http://www.westerntrilobites.com/Species/Emigrantia.htm  References  Category:Cambrian trilobites Category:Redlichiida genera Category:Biceratopsidae ","title":"Emigrantia"},{"id":"36703999","text":"Otto II the Generous may refer to: *Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg (after 1147‚Äì1205) *Otto II, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (about 1266‚Äì1330) ","title":"Otto II the Generous"},{"id":"36704002","text":"The Clinton‚ÄìHardy House on S. Guthrie in Tulsa, Oklahoma was built in 1919. It was designed by architect George Winkler and built for Mr. and Mrs. Lee Clinton. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description The house was sited on a bluff on the east bank of the Arkansas River and has a brick wall around it on three sides. The structure consists of four levels containing 14 rooms with . of floor space. It includes elements older than the house itself, namely its entrance door, sidelights, and fan light, that were taken from an older residence in New Orleans. and The main (ground level) floor has a large entry foyer with a curved oak staircase. The dining room is to the right, with a butler's pantry and the kitchen. The living room and a sun porch are also on the ground floor. The second floor contains four bedrooms and two bathrooms. The third floor consists of a full-height, floored attic. A separate stairway leads to this level. The basement has a boiler room, coal bin, wine and canning cellar, storage room and a laundry. Owner Lee Clinton (1875‚Äì1956) was born in Red Fork, Indian Territory. In 1896, he was hired by the Tulsa Banking Company. Ten years later, he co-founded the Bank of Commerce with his brother-in-law, James H. McBirney. In 1916, he founded the Union National Bank of Tulsa, which he housed in the Clinton Building. Besides banking and real estate, Clinton was interested in cattle raising. He and oilman William G. Skelly co-founded the Tulsa Stockyards. Clinton's first wife, Susan, died in 1952. He remarried, but died in 1958. His widow continued to live in the house until 1972. It was the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Robert B.

The directive uses a polluter pays to assign the cost of the updates to the plant. The plan to lower emissions is based on Best available technology to help reach the goals of the directive. The plan allows for flexibility given the best available technology; exemptions to the directive can be granted to firms as well if the cost is greater than the benefit. Rationale The European Commission undertook a 2-year review with all stakeholders to examine how the legislation on industrial emissions could be improved to offer a high level of protection for the environment and human health while simplifying the existing legislation and cutting unnecessary administrative costs. Throughout Europe there is high acceptance that industrial emissions are the leading cause of pollution in Europe. As well there is high support for a system where the polluter will pay under a Polluter pays principle. The IED is intended to provide significant improvement on the interaction between the previous seven directives (including the Waste Incineration Directive) which it replaces. It also strengthens, in several instances, some provisions in previous directives, for example the Large Combustion Plant Directive. Exemptions Certain firms are allowed to apply for exemptions when the cost of the best available technology is higher than the benefit. They will be evaluated using Cost‚Äìbenefit analysis to decide if an exemption will be granted to the firm. Bulgaria is currently seeking an exemption for their whole fleet of coal fired power plants. Criticism The exemptions have allowed for a large amount of Europe's power plants to exceed the set standards. There is concern that if the exemptions were removed some plants will be forced to shut down due to the increased cost associated with the best available technology. With the passing of stricter laws now makes it harder for some plants to receive an exemption from the directive.

A government agency under the Ministry of Justice and Public Order responsible for overseeing the incarceration of persons convicted of crimes. A common misconception is that the Cyprus Police runs the correctional facilities in Cyprus. This is mainly because the Cyprus Prisons department and the Cyprus Police have almost identical logos, patches, uniforms and are both operating holding facilities. However the Cyprus Police and the Cyprus Prisons Departments, although under the same ministry, are completely separate. A simple explanation for who is responsible for keeping a felon at each stage is that the Police are responsible for detaining suspects in Police holding cells until they are formally charged and then are released to appear at a court on a later date while the Prisons department is responsible for people already convicted by a court to jail time and they are serving their sentence in prison. An exception to this, is felons which have a high probability of escaping if they are released to appear to a court on a later date or felons that are too dangerous to be released, where after they are formally charged by the Police they are taken to a court and the court issues a warrant for the person to be placed in a prison for the entire duration of their trial (which can take several years) until they are acquitted or convicted. If the person is convicted, this period of time, counts towards the sentence as time already served. Mission The policy of the Department of Prisons is based on four principles.Cyprus Prisons Department Official Website #security #humanitarian treatment #education #rehabilitation For this reason the Department of Prisons has as a primary mission: *The secure detention of prisoners who are referred to it by the courts. *Ensuring prison conditions which guarantee respect for human dignity. *Equal treatment of detainees without any discrimination due to race, color, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, political or other beliefs of prisoners. *Encouraging self-esteem and developing a sense of responsibility of prisoners by providing them educational opportunities, vocational training, creative recreation, reflection, self-criticism and self- awareness. *Guiding and assisting prisoners to a new start in life.

His first marriage failed after discord with his wife about their religious faith.Zu der Mordtat in Hassenberg, Coburger Zeitung (June 9, 1925) When Br√ºckner was about 10 years old his father was struck and killed by lightning, while he himself was left unconscious, an incident that was said to have caused a change of his character.Die Beerdigung der Opfer des Hassenberger Massenm√∂rders, Coburger Zeitung (June 11, 1925) During World War I he was conscripted repeatedly, but was discharged each time due to his mental state, the last and final time in 1917. An evaluation conducted after his murders described him as a hysteric epileptic, suffering from mental retardation.√úber die Mordtaten in Hassenberg, Coburger Zeitung (July 31, 1925) Br√ºckner had an interest in the supernatural and various books about witchcraft, ghosts, and evocation, as well as two Himmelsbriefe were found among his belongings when police searched his home.Hassenberg, Coburger Zeitung (June 18, 1925) He was also interested in notorious contemporary murderers, and was especially occupied with serial killer Fritz Haarmann. It was stated that he had sketched the murderer's head and studied reports about his case in detail. Police also found a note at his workplace reading \\"Massenm√∂rder Haarmann! Massenm√∂rder Denke! Massenm√∂rder ? ? ?\\" (Mass murderer Haarmann! Mass murderer Denke! Mass murderer ? ? ?) in reference to Fritz Haarmann and Karl Denke, another serial killer whose crimes made headlines at that time. At the time of the murders Br√ºckner lived, together with his mother, at the house of his sister and her husband, and was said to have argued with them frequently. He was believed to have killed his sister-in-law two years prior to the mass murder, and in the days leading up to June 6 he made various comments that indicated he had planned his crime for some time. Murders During the night of June 6, 1925, 31-year-old Br√ºckner cycled to Lindenberg, arriving there at about 11 p.m. He waited for his brother-in-law, Hugo Birnstiel, and accompanied him for a while on his way, but eventually lured him into a forest, where he hit him with a piece of iron on the back of his head. The 19-year-old managed to escape, whereupon Br√ºckner returned to Lindenberg to the house of his parents-in-law where his estranged wife was living. He waited for the pregnant woman at the outhouse and, apparently after she had declined his request to return to him, cut her throat with a knife. While she ran back to the house and died in her father's arms, Br√ºckner made his two-hour trip back to Hassenberg. There he entered the house of his sister, Wilhelmine Rosenbauer, and killed her, her husband Eduard, and their five children - four girls aged 2, 10, 16 and 19 years, and a boy aged 8 - as well as his own mother by smashing their skulls with an axe and cutting their throats with the kitchen knife. Subsequently, he washed the bodies of his mother and Ilse Br√ºckner, before finally hanging himself at his mother's bed. Police, alerted after the murder of his wife, arrived at the house around 4 a.m., but could only ascertain the deaths of all its inhabitants.Furchtbare Bluttat in Hassenberg, Coburger Zeitung (June 8, 1925)Der Massenmord in Th√ºringen, Die Neue Zeitung (June 9, 1925)Hassenberg, Coburger Zeitung (June 15, 1925)Neunfacher Mord und Selbstmord, Jenaer Volksblatt (June 8, 1925)Furchtbare Bluttat, Ingolst√§dter Anzeiger (June 9, 1925)Ein zweiter Angerstein, Neuer Hochheimer Stadtanzeiger (June 9, 1925) Br√ºckner left a letter where he accused his brother-in-law, Hugo Birnstiel, to have had an incestuous relationship with his own sister (Br√ºckner's wife), which had resulted in her pregnancy. He also alluded to a conflict about some geese with Eduard Rosenbauer, whom he called a savage. It was not believed that these accusations had any foundation in reality though, instead it was suggested that Br√ºckner might have heard imaginary conversations between his wife and Birnstiel that made him believe they had a relationship. =Victims= Among those killed were: *Margarete Barbara Br√ºckner, 71, Wilhelm Br√ºckner's mother *Wilhelmine Karoline Rosenbauer, 41, Wilhelm Br√ºckner's sister *Eduard Rosenbauer, 44, husband of Wilhelmine Rosenbauer *Ilse Br√ºckner *Emmy Br√ºckner References Category:1925 deaths Category:German mass murderers Category:German murderers of children Category:20th-century German criminals Category:Familicides Category:1925 crimes Category:German spree killers Category:Mass murder in 1925 Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:Year of birth missing Category:Basket weavers Category:Criminals from Bavaria Category:People from Coburg (district) Category:Stabbing attacks in Germany ","title":"Wilhelm Br√ºckner (murderer)"},{"id":"36704103","text":"Wirat Wangchan (born 25 February 1976) is a Thailand former professional football Goalkeeper who played for Thailand in the 2000 Asian Cup.

The series was created and produced by Joe and Tony Gayton who wrote and co-wrote two episodes. They also serve as the show's showrunners. In addition to the Gaytons, Jeremy Gold, John Shiban, and David Von Ancken also serve as series executive producers. The season follows Cullen Bohannon, who joined a group of Rebel bandits robbing trains and planning to start a new Confederate colony in Mexico. While attacking Thomas Durant's payroll train, Cullen is captured by authorities and sentenced to death, but Durant intervenes with a pardon on the condition that Cullen returns to Hell on Wheels to help oversee railroad construction. The second season was met with favorable reviews from critics with the premiered watched by just over 2.5 million viewers. The numbers were down significantly from the first season's premiere and finale.  Cast  = Main cast = The second season features ten series regulars. Robin McLeavy and Christopher Heyerdahl are promoted from recurring status. * Anson Mount as Cullen Bohannon, a former worker for the Union Pacific Railroad, he's part of a band of robbers. (10 episodes) * Colm Meaney as Thomas \\"Doc\\" Durant, a businessman and investor in the First Transcontinental Railroad, where he hopes to make his fortune. (9 episodes) * Common as Elam Ferguson, a recently freed slave, he's the chief of railroad police. (10 episodes) * Dominique McElligott as Lily Bell, having adopted her husband's dream, Lily commits to seeing the railroad through to completion, but has to deal with the moral sacrifices that such an endeavor demands. (10 episodes) * Christopher Heyerdahl as Thor Gundersen, also known as \\"the Swede\\", an undertaker and custodian, having been tarred and feathered by the citizens of Hell on Wheels when he was in charge of security.

(8 episodes) * Robin McLeavy as Eva, a former indian whore, she supports herself by working in the Hell on Wheels brothel. (9 episodes) = Recurring cast =  Production  =Filming= Production began in late-April 2012. While last season's exterior filming took place on the Tsuu T‚Äôina Nation indian reserve, this season's exterior were filmed near the Bow River in Calgary, allowing for bigger sets, approximately 3002 feet (915 meters) of railroad track, and an extra locomotive and nearly a dozen loosely made, wooden structures to be built. Interior filming was done in a 56,000-square-foot (over 5202 square meters) makeshift studio near the city's airport. Series producers said filming the season's ten episodes took about 80 days. Anson Mount (Cullen Bohannon) spoke about the differences between the seasons: \\"The big question of this season is why is Cullen Bohannon sticking with the railroad. Why is he here? And hopefully that will be absolutely answered by the end of the season. I think for me, it's also been about opening up different facets of the character. I want to find the parts of Cullen that are light, that are aware of humor, and that's been a particularly exciting thing for me to do this year.\\" Dominique McElligott (Lily Bell) also spoke of the character changes: \\"When I arrived in Calgary and I read the script, my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe where Lily was. Her motivations have changed, and her ambition from her husband has become her own ambition... Lily's character has surprised me in terms of how cunning she's become and calculating and how determined and ambitious that she is.\\" Common (Elam Ferguson) spoke about the audience's perception of the American frontier through Elam: \\"We haven't seen a character like this from that time period, and I think that was important. One thing that I've really appreciated about Elam is that he's a leader and very intelligent. He cares for people, he's passionate, and has his own dream, and thinks for himself. You know, he's a human being. And I think that's one of the most important things that people can learn from Hell on Wheels and that time period is that people were people. Some of the same things that we go through now, they experienced.\\" =Casting= Virginia Madsen was cast in a four-episode story arc as Hannah Durant, wife of Thomas.  Episodes   Reception  =Critical reception= The second season received a 60 out of 100 aggregate score, based on nine reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average\\" reception at Metacritic. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the season start a B+, calling it \\"visually impressive,\\" adding \\"the show rises or falls each week on the strength of the moments when [Anson] Mount and Common dominate. Each actor in his own way is capable of lifting Hell on Wheels to the level the series so clearly wants to attain: a fresh take on the old macho code of a-man's-gotta-do-what-a-man's-gotta-do, without posturing or a self- consciousness about the century of Westerns that have preceded it.\\" Salons Willa Paskin called the new season \\"a perfectly adequate piece of television with above adequate production values\\", adding \\"even if Westerns aren't particularly your thing, Hell on Wheels doesn't hurt to watch, if, you know, it's not actually fun to watch.\\" Verne Gay of Newsday gave it a B- and stated \\"the cast [...] is good, while the Old West still feels especially beautiful and perilous.\\" New York Magazines Matt Zoller Seitz stated the show \\"still looks and sounds great, has a mostly capable cast, and delivers flat-out terrific Elam scenes, large-scale action set pieces, and lantern-lit images that reminded of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. But the rest is wasted motion.\\" Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post found the second season \\"marginally better paced and the characters moderated a bit from the broad archetypes seen in Season 1,\\" but added \\"It's a mystery to me how something about the building of railroad can so often fail to take advantage of the literal engine at its core.\\" The AV Club gave Season 2 a grade of B- overall, but suggested that it might be the last.https://www.avclub.com/articles/blood-moonblood-moon-rising,86001/ =Ratings= The second-season premiere was watched by just over 2.5 million viewers and 793,000 adults aged 18‚Äì49, a 0.6 Nielsen rating.

Origins The word 'quasi' consists of two Latin words: Quam + Si. Quam, in Latin, means ‚Äòas much as‚Äô and Si means ‚Äòif.‚Äô The prefix ‚Äòquasi‚Äô connotes the meaning ‚Äì ‚Äòsimilar to but not exactly the same as.‚Äô Thus, quasi-judicial proceedings are similar to but not exactly court proceedings. The term also implies that these authorities are not routinely responsible for holding such proceedings and often may have other duties. In short, an administrative function is called ‚Äòquasi-judicial‚Äô when there is an obligation to assume a judicial approach and to comply with the basic requirements of natural justice. Thus, the fundamental purpose of a quasi-judicial hearing is to provide the affected parties due process. Due process requires notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard.

She came to the United States at a young age as the daughter of political refugees (her father, theoretical physicist Alexander Vilenkin was blacklisted for 'refusal to cooperate' after resisting recruitment into the KGB). She was raised in Massachusetts where she attended art school, focusing on photography. Career After graduating, she moved to Austin, Texas where she began busking in doorways, performing her own songs.

The eleventh episode of the series is written by Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton, and directed by David Von Ancken. In the episode, on the run for his crimes, Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) robs trains with a group of ex-Confederate soldiers, while Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) and Thomas Durant (Colm Meaney) continue the Union Pacific Railroad's westward progress. Plot A band of masked robbers hijacks Thomas Durant's payroll train, though a guard shoots one of them in the shoulder. The wounded bandit takes off his mask as he flees to reveal it is Cullen Bohannon. Later, Hawkins (Ryan Robbins), leader of the robbers, gives him his cut of the stolen money. Cullen insists they save their money to start a Confederate colony in Mexico, but Hawkins thinks the men should celebrate their victory and rob more trains. Doc Whitehead (Grainger Hines), an old friend of Cullen's, extracts a bullet fragment from Cullen's shoulder and apologizes for involving him in the gang. The train robbers later drink at a trading post, where a pair of former Union soldiers provoke Cullen into a fight after their comments about Southerners. At the railway office, Lily tells Durant that railroad construction has been slow and complains about the foreman. Elam (Common) informs Durant that the payroll train was robbed again. Outside, Durant speaks with the Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl), who is tending his wagon. The Swede offers to help restore order in town, but Durant thinks he should continue his new jobs as undertaker and custodian, having been tarred and feathered by the citizens of Hell on Wheels when he was in charge of security. Nell (April Telek) finds one of the prostitutes murdered in bed, and a crowd watches silently as the Swede loads the body onto his wagon. Durant tells Lily about the murdered woman, a first for Hell on Wheels, and Lily insists they find and punish the killer, but Durant doesn't care, as she was a whore. Lily later gives the Swede money to ensure the dead woman receives a proper burial. Spying on another train, Cullen recognizes Elam as the guard, then demands to be the first man on the train. As the bandits rob passengers on the train, Cullen barges into the payroll car and orders Elam to hand over the money, explaining that he is saving Elam's life. He refuses, and Cullen urges the robbers off the train, saying Elam overpowered him. Cullen urges the bandits to head straight to Mexico, but Hawkins wants to rob one more train and questions Cullen's motives. Cullen relents and agrees with Hawkins. Durant chastises Elam for letting Cullen live, but Elam points out he was hired to only protect the payroll. He then offers to help get Hell on Wheels back on track, but Durant hesitates, on account of Elam's race, but says he will consider it. Sean and Mickey are now selling real estate in Hell on Wheels. Ruth approaches Sean with news that her father has been unable to preach for a few weeks and asks for more time on the rent. Sean proposes having dinner to discuss her affairs, but Ruth turns him down. At the brothel, Nell strikes a protection deal with Sean McGinnes (Ben Esler) for 10% of her profits. He later tells Mickey (Phil Burke) she agreed on the condition that they kill the whore's murderer. Standing at the edge of a river, Lily tells Durant that the Sioux tribe considers the land on the other side sacred and her husband Robert wanted to avoid it. Durant disregards her, says the Sioux will be the least of their troubles if they do not get the railroad under control. Doc urges Cullen to forgo the heist and leave, saying the others are unhappy with him. Later, as the men rob the train, Cullen points his gun at one who is terrorizing a mother and child. The bandit knocks out a distracted Cullen, who wakes to find himself in a prison wagon, where he jokes with a ruffian (Mark Anderako), a fellow prisoner. Later, from his jail cell, Cullen watches a firing squad kill the ruffian, knowing he could be next. Reception =Ratings= \\"Viva La Mexico\\" was watched by 2.45 million viewers and received a 0.6 rating among viewers aged 18-49. =Critical reception= The episode received fairly positive reviews. The A.V. Clubs Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a B- grade, which was \\"somewhat provisional, my way of splitting the difference between all the problems of last season and the potential I still think the show has. This episode could look a lot better or a lot worse in retrospect, depending on how things proceed from here.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also gave the episode a B- grade, calling it \\"a solid, meat-and-potatoes example of a genre (Westerns)\\". However, he added that while the cinematography was \\"beautiful to look at\\", most of the characters were \\"still thin and unengaging, even in their new stations.\\" Their stories, he stated, \\"seem to be moving in circles, even as the railroad itself keeps moving forward.\\" TV Fanatic's Sean McKenna rated the episode with 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \\"Maybe it wasn't a jaw dropping premiere or switched things up in a wild way, but it was engaging nonetheless and started off with plenty of promise, potential and pure Western fun.\\"  References  External links * * TV.com: Viva La Mexico * TV Guide: Viva La Mexico Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Hell on Wheels (TV series) episodes ","title":"Viva la Mexico"},{"id":"36704484","text":"Bhattadeva (1558‚Äì1638)(‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡ßÄ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ: ‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶£‡ßç‡¶†‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶• ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶ó‡ß±‡¶§ ‡¶≠‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡ß∞‡ßç‡¶Ø), (Baikunthanatha Bhagavata Bhattacharya) is acknowledged as the father of Assamese prose. Though Bhaktiratnakar-katha, the Assamese translation of Sankardev's Sanskrit composition Bhaktiratnakar by Gopala Charana Dwija preceded the works of Bhattadeva, Bhattadeva's prose had an influence in the development of a high and dignified style. Bhattadeva's and Gopala Charana Dvija's 16th century works are considered to be the earliest examples of prose in Indian languages. Bhattadeva's erudition in Sanskrit grammar and literature, and his command over the Bhagavata earned him the title of Bhagavata Bhattacharya.\\"Bhattadeva had a profound grammar and literature which earned for him the title of Bhagavata Bhattacharya\\" (versed in the Bhagavata). Biography Bhattadeva was born to Chandra Bharati and Tara Devi in a Brahmin family of Bichankuchi, Bajali (Kamrup). After finishing his education he became a disciple of Damodara Deva and succeeded him as the head of Patbausi satra at Barpeta. He established the Byaskuchi satra some time later where he died. He is best known for Katha Bhagavat and Katha Gita, though some minor works like Saranamalika and Prasangamala are also ascribed to him. Work Bhattadeva began translating the Sanskrit Bhagavata into Assamese prose at the bidding of Damodaradeva, who wanted it to be accessible to the common man. He rendered Katha Bhagavata in a discursive style that is dignified and balanced. He maintains the same sense of dialogue in the Katha Gita. Though he uses short sentences, popular vocabulary and the expressive cadence of the colloquial, he uses Sanskrit vocables heavily and his language is an elevated one. After completing the Bhagavata and the Gita, he rendered the Bhaktiratnavali into elegant prose. He also compiled a book of devotional verses in Sanskrit gleaned from the Upanishads, Puranas and Samhitas illustrating all the elements of Bhakti. The work, Bhakti-Viveka reveals extensive knowledge and erudition of Bhattadeva, from the vedic to the puranic literature. Bhattadeva's contributions are not confined to prose literature, he wrote poetry also. Bhattadev University of Assam is named after him.

The Blessed Costanza Starace also once resided here. The initial layout was attributed to Masuccio II, but further reconstructions and decorations proceeded in 1646 and 1750. The architects Bartolomeo Vecchione and Crescenzo Torchese were involved in the latter reconstructions, including the facade. Much of the artwork has been moved or lost. The ceiling canvases in the nave were attributed to Balducci and his disciples. Other works made for the church or chapels were attributed to Andrea Malinconico; Giovanni Battista Caracciolo; a Virgin with St Anthony of Padua and Elizabeth of Hungary by Antonio Stabile, pupil of Silvestro Bruno; and a Virgin of the Rosary with St Domenic, Rose, Gennaro, and Barbara by Giacinto Popoli, pupil of Massimo Stanzione.Guida Sacra della citta di Napoli per Gennaro Aspreno Galante, 1873, page 144-145.

The store itself was founded in 1885, with the building being constructed in 1929. At its peak, two other Boston Stores were opened, in addition to the downtown store. The Boston Store was closed in 1979. The building remained abandoned until 1988, when it was renovated into a combination apartment and commercial building, and was renamed Boston Store Place. The Boston Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.  Design  The Boston Store is located between 7th and 8th Streets on State Street in downtown Erie. The six-story tall, buff brick building is predominantly cubical with a frontage of along State Street. The facade is divided into eight bays by brick piers.; the bays are further subdivided by secondary piers. The top of the building is capped with parapet, with piers extending above it and topped with stone coping. Vertical panels containing blue and tan terracotta are inset in the parapets of each bay. The bay containing the main entrance is off-centered and wider than the others; instead of a parapet, it is capped with a balcony-like structure inlaid with terracotta. The \\"signature exterior feature of the Boston Store\\" is the four sided, bell and clock tower situated over the main entrance. It is supported by four tiers of buttresses, each decreasing in size and capped with beveled limestone. The design of the clock tower \\"recalls religious, civic, and collegiate themes, and became an instant landmark on the Erie skyline.\\" Each of the four clock faces are in diameter and have \\"black metal Roman numerals [on] a background of white translucent glass panels\\". Terra-cotta circles are inlaid across the top of the tower and \\"above the last step of the buttresses\\". The lower section of the tower houses the bell behind a geometric tracery. Clock inside the Boston Store A hallway running from State Street to Peach Street entrances bisects the Boston Store. A cube- shaped, four-sided clock built by International Business Machines hangs in the hallway. Lettering on the marquees denote the building as the and . For a short time in early 2011, the signs were replaced with ones for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, before public sentiment forced the switch back. Additions made to the building provided entrances on Peach and 8th Streets. The store did have an annex with an entrance on 7th Street, but that has since been demolished.  History  The Boston Store was founded in 1885 when Elisha H. Mack bought the bankrupt Erie Dry Goods Store. Mack renamed the store after Boston, Massachusetts, then the \\"perceived...center of fashion and culture.\\" The store was moved from its original location on Peach Street to the 700-block of State Street in 1886. From 1886 to 1930, the Boston Store expanded, purchasing more of the property on its block. By the late 1920s, the store had managed to acquire frontage on all four surrounding streets--Peach, State, 7th and 8th. Mack retired in 1925, shortly after his longtime business partner died. In 1929, a new Boston Store was designed by the Erie- architectural firm Shutts & Morrison. The new store was completed in 1931 and was estimated to have cost $2 million. From 1949 to 1953, renovations and expansion of the Boston Store were carried out by the local architectural firm Myers & Krider. The three-story portion of the Boston Store facing Peach Street was raised to six in 1949; the three-story structure on 8th Street was demolished and replaced with a five-story one the next year. Escalators were installed on the first through fifth floors in 1953. The Boston Store was bought by Associated Dry Goods in 1959. Management of the Boston Store was assumed by Horne's department store of Pittsburgh in December 1975\\\\. Because of the loss of sales caused by competition from the Millcreek Mall in nearby Millcreek Township, the Boston Store was closed on July 7, 1979. = Current Use = The Boston Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 24, 1996. The upper five floors were renovated into 125 apartments. The radio stations WFNN, WJET, WRKT, and WRTS broadcast from the building. A restaurant was opened on September 22, 2008 on the ground floor of the Boston Store, but closed in December 2013. UPMC Health Plan moved into a space on the first floor in early 2011.

The capture was a major victory for the Biafrans because the victory opened up telephone lines, enhanced road telecommunications, and showed that with stiff resistance, Biafra could defeat Nigerian forces.  Prelude  In July 1968, commander of the 3rd Marine Commando (3MCDO), Colonel Benjamin Adekunle began making plans for an invasion of Aba, Owerri, and Umuahia in a military operation he nicknamed Operation OAU. Adekunle stated that he would be able to capture all three cities in two weeks. Adekunle's strategy was to surround a city and starve it into submission before attacking its weakened defenders. After 12 days of violent fighting in Aba, the 3MCDO managed to capture the city on September 14, followed by Owerri on September 16. When the 3MCDO was pushed back at Umuahia, the Nigerians retreated to Owerri, where they set up defenses in and around the city. The Biafrans made their way down the Aba-Umuahia road and managed to capture the entire road along with Aba on October 15. The Siege On 15 October 1968, while Nigerian Head of State Yakubu Gowon was distracted by the anti-tax riots in the west, the Biafran Brigadier Alexander Madiebo encircled Owerri while a unit of Biafran soldiers attacked Nigerian supply convoys attempting to enter the city. The Biafrans were assisted by heavy rain and mud which slowed down supply convoys even further. On 3 December the Biafran 14th Division under Colonel Ogbugo Kalu and 63rd Brigade under Col. Lambert Ihenacho moved towards Owerri, capturing the villages of Eziama and Elelem. On 5 December the Biafran 60th Brigade under Colonel Azum Asoya began the main assault on Owerri, in which over 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 300 mortars, 200 howitzer shells, and 20 anti-tank weapons were fired. The assault lasted for two days but the 3,000-man Nigerian 16th Division under Colonel E. A. Etuk stayed in their original position, while suffering heavy casualties. The Biafran 68th Battalion under Major Ikeji gained control of a stretch of the Port Harcourt road from Owerri to the Otamiri River, establishing a link with the 63rd Brigade. On 19 December 16 Division regrouped its soldiers and captured the town of Abiaka, followed by Avu and Afrola on 29 December. On 6 January 1969 the Biafran 60th Brigade captured Umuakpu, Umuagwo, and Omanelu while the Biafran 68th Battalion under Major Ikeji seized Obinze; the 68th Battalion attempted to capture Avu but were beaten back by the Nigerian 16th Brigade. By the end of the day, the Biafrans controlled much of the Port Harcourt road and began planting mines, digging ditches, and laying trees across it in an attempt to block any Nigerian reinforcements from entering Owerri. On 15 January the Biafran 60th Brigade attacked Owerri and were able to force the 16th Division to retreat across the Otamini Bridge. Instead of pursuing the retreating Nigerians, the hungry and half-naked Biafran soldiers discovered the Nigerians' food and clothing supplies and decided to have their fill. The Nigerian 16th Brigade was able to regroup and made a counter-attack across the Otamini Bridge, causing the Biafrans to retreat. On 24 January the Nigerian government renewed its offensive and began bombing Biafran positions in the area. After five days of continuous air strikes, the Biafrans remained in their original positions; the Nigerian government knew that Owerri was encircled and they couldn't do anything about it. On 7 February both the Nigerian Air Force and Egyptian mercenaries bombed out and completely destroyed the villages of Umohiagu and Ozu Abam, which prompted accusations of deliberately targeting civilians. The government ordered the Nigerian Air Force to avoid civilian targets but they disregarded this request and continued to bomb towns and Red Cross shelters. In late February, Gen. Gowon visited the 16th Brigade in Owerri and attempted to encourage them to keep fighting until re-enforcements could be sent. On 14 March Nigerian troops attempted to capture the Omanelu-Umuakpu and Elele-Ubimini-Awarra roads but were beaten back by defending Biafran soldiers, leaving them isolated and short of food. On 15 March the Biafran S Division under Major Timothy Onwuatuegwu made a frontal assault on the 16th Brigade but was forced to halt after suffering heavy casualties. Major Onwuatuegwu placed half of his men under the command of Major Joseph Achuzie and were able to get within 1 km of the city. Major Achuzie demanded total control of the S Division but was refused by Onwuatuegwu and the two men almost shot each other after drawing their guns. President Ojukwu stepped in and gave Major Achuzie control of the S Division for one week, continuing the frontal assault on Owerri. Achuzie's plan ultimately failed and he retreated after suffering heavy casualties, Ojukwu then immediately restored Onwuatuegwu as commander and began drawing up new plans for invading Owerri. On 31 March the Biafran 14th Division under Ogbugo Kalu attacked Owerri and secured control over 70% of the city. Biafran soldiers began intercepting radio waves that revealed the 16th Brigade was going to execute all Biafran POWs due to a lack of food. The Swedish pilot Carl Gustaf von Rosen and his \\"Biafra Babies\\" fighter squadron, consisting of six MFI-9 Junior fighters, constantly hounded Nigerian air drops, making Nigerian food supplies scarce. On 20 April Etuk's second-in-command, Major Ted Hamman, was shot and killed in Owerri by a Biafran sniper who had managed to get within firing range. On 24 April the remaining 300 soldiers of the Nigerian 16th Division began fighting their way out of Owerri and escaped into Nigerian held territory on 25 April.  Aftermath  Two days before Owerri's capture, the Biafran capital, Umuahia, fell to Col. Mohammed Shuwa's 1st Division and the capital was moved to Aba. Once Owerri was retaken, the Biafran capital was once again moved, now to Owerri. The Biafrans held on to Owerri for over eight months until the Nigerian 3rd Marine Division, under Col. Olusegun Obasanjo, attacked and occupied the city on January 7, 1970.

Distillery A whisky distillery was founded in Cambus in 1806. Fahrenheit 173 - Whisky Distilleries It or another was re-established by John Mowbray in 1813whiskiesofscotland.com or perhaps 1836. In 1877 ownership was merged into the Distillers Company. The distillery was closed down in 1993.scotchwhisky.net: Cambus Scotch Whisky Distillery There is a song about Cambus Whisky which mentions \\"sober Sandy\\" who was reportedly a ballman at the distillery. The Cambus Iron Bridge over the Devon was constructed in the early 19th century to span the River Devon and link with the distillery founded in 1806. It is a Category A listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Security is a concern for any distillery, and in at least the 1950s the Cambus distillery was guarded at night by a flock of geese, with their wings clipped to prevent flight. During the day, to prevent the workforce being attacked, the geese were kept in an enclosure across the road, and were generally found to be intimidating by passers-by. This would have been intended to deter any would-be thieves. The degree of success is unknown, however nowadays the sign of a conventional security company is displayed on the perimeter of the site. Brewery Robert Knox & Son brewed in Cambus. Some of there beer labels still survive. Famous Inhabitants Magnus Pyke formerly lived in Cambus, close to the station and distillery. Rail connections From the early 1850s until 1968 Cambus was served by passenger trains of the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway. The station was to the west of the level crossing on the road into the village, and had a large signal box, which controlled two level crossings, the junction with the line to Menstrie and Alva, and access to sidings in the brewery and distillery. The line was re-opened in 2008 as part of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link.

Czechoslovakia  In 1935, there were 17,148 public, school and university libraries in Czechoslovakia, having a book stock of 8,528,744 volumes. Many of these items were confiscated by the Germans, especially any Czech books dealing with geography, biography or history. Works by any Czech writers were taken away, many burned, most others taken directly to the paper pulp mills. Special libraries were devastated, and suffered a loss of about 2,000,000 volumes.Zivny, Ladislav. 1946. ‚ÄúCzechoslovak Libraries During theWar and After.‚Äù Page 877. ‚ÄúCzechoslovak Libraries after the Munich Pact‚Ä¶ Soon afterwards all the Czech books dealing with geography, biography, and especially history disappeared‚Ä¶ After being confiscated, many of these were burned, whole collections totally destroyed or taken away to Germany‚Ä¶.‚ÄùStubbings, Hilda Ur√©n.

Official notices of censorship and destruction of Czech nationalist and ethnic literature were given. A decree of the autumn of 1942 ordered all university libraries to hand over all early printed Czech works and first editions to the Germans. The collections in the National Museum were pillaged; and the Modern Art Gallery, containing a unique collection of Czech art of the 19th and 20th centuries with some precious specimens of foreign (mainly French) art, was closed. The entire political literature of the free republic, as well as the works of the participants in the Czech revival of the 18th and 19th centuries, were withdrawn. The books of Jewish authors were prohibited, as well as those of politically unreliable writers. The Germans withdrew the Czech classics, as well as the works of the 15th century reformer John Hus, of Alois Jir√°sek, the author of historical novels, the poet Victor Dyck, Karel ƒåapek, Vladislav Vanƒçura and others. Thus the Hitlerites destroyed the national culture of the peoples of Czechoslovakia, plundered and pillaged works of art, literature, and science. It can be seen as gruesome precedence allowing communist regime, alongside with Soviet ocuppants post 1948 - 1968 respectively, to withhold parts of the seminal cultural heritage for generations.Nuremberg Trial Proceedings.

The entire library of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was lost. Whether directly or indirectly related to the damages of war, total book resources in Japanese libraries were cut by 50%, and when the Occupation forces arrived in 1945 there were probably fewer than five million books in the country.Welch, Theodore F. 1997. Libraries and Librarianship in Japan. Page 17. ‚ÄúIn Japan, as in Germany, human and cultural destruction (including the loss of texts) were, of course, paired.

When the occupation troops arrived in 1945, there were probably fewer than five million books in the country. Three quarters of all public libraries suffered heavy damage, with 400,000 volumes in public library collections lost in a bombing raid on Tokyo alone. Heavy damage was sustained by government libraries; more than 655,000 volumes of the Tokyo area were burned, including libraries of the Cabinet, Bureau of Patents and Standards, and Finance Ministry.‚ÄùKnuth, Rebecca. 2003.

Latvia  * 1940 Baltic states: After the occupation by Soviet troops an official list of Banned Books and Brochures was issued in Latvia in November 1940. With additional lists, over 4,000 titles were proscribed: historical, political and ‚Äònationalist authors‚Äô. In Latvia as in Estonia and Lithuania such books were removed from bookstores and libraries and, in many cases, publicly burned.Hoeven, Hans van der; Van Albada, Joan, 1996, ‚ÄúMemory of the World: Lost Memory: Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the 20th Century.‚Äù Pages 7-15. They comment from: R.J. Misiunas and R. Taagepera, The Baltic States. Years of dependence 1940-1980. London, 1983, p. 36. Latvia was occupied by the Soviets from 1944 to 1991. What records remained after the defeat of the Germans were either removed to Russia or destroyed by intent or neglect. In Latvia, Holocaust scholarship could only be resumed once Soviet rule had ended. Much of the post-1991 work was devoted to identification of the victims. This was complicated by the passage of time and the loss of some records and the concealment of others by the NKVD and its successor agencies of the Soviet secret police.Anders, Edward and Juris Dubrovskis. 2003. ‚ÄúWho Died in the Holocaust? Recovering Names from Official Records.‚Äù Holocaust and Genocide Studies 17.1 (2003), pages 114-138.  Lithuania  ‚ÄúPolitical upheavals have often created a frustrating situation for librarians and citizens in general. Consider the case of the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which in 1918 had regained their independence after centuries of Russian occupation? As a result of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact of 1940, they were once more occupied by Russian troops and in 1940 bookstores and libraries were 'cleansed' and unwelcome titles were burned. In 1941 Nazi Germany conquered these countries, only to be driven out once more by the Soviet army in 1944-1945. These succeeding regimes brought not only an appalling waste of human lives, but also rapidly alternating prohibitions of books, purging of libraries and the rewriting of history and textbooks.‚Äù In Lituania, all universities and public libraries have been closed, and Gestapo agents removed or destroyed the equipment of the scientific institutions and books of the national libraries. The Academy of Arts was ransacked, and in Kaunas, the archives of the Academies of Science and Music were destroyed. Over 10,000 volumes were stolen from the State Library, and 23,000 more were stolen from the University Library. In part, this was in reprisal for the country‚Äôs steadfast refusal to create a legion of Lithuanian volunteers to fight against the Russians.Axelsson, George. 1943. ‚ÄúLithuania Sacked in Nazi Vengence: Academies of Medicine, Art, Science and Literature Looted, ministers and Intellectuals Rounded Up; Refused Aid in Russia; Failure to Send ‚ÄòVolunteers‚Äô Long a Grievance, Finally Brings Reprisals.‚Äù The New York Times. June 5, 1943, page 1. In Vilna (Vilnius, Vilno, Wilno, etc) the ERR set up a collecting point for Lithuania. Dr. Gotthard of the Berlin headquarters arrived in August 1941, and began looting the Strashun Library. He conscripted the labor of two Gestapo prisoners, including A.Y. Goldschmidt, librarian of the Hispanic-Ethnographic Society. Eventually, he committed suicide rather than assist the looting of the libraries. Dr. Johannes Pohl appeared in January 1942, and ordered that the city be made a collecting point for the region, and concentrated at the Yidisher Visenshaftlikker Institut (Institute for Jewish Research). Materials were brought in from the private collections from Kovno, Shavle, Mariapol, Volozhn and other towns, and included books from over 300 synagogues and personal libraries. Some of the Jewish workers were able to smuggle out and hide some of the most valuable books in the ghetto, which was stopped when the ghetto was liquidated in July 1943. The accumulated collection of over 100,000 volumes were separated into piles by century of publication, and about 20,000 were selected for shipment to Germany. The remaining materials were pulped to avoid storage and transportation costs, and to make a small profit. One incident involved an assistant of Dr. Pohl dumping out five cases of rare books in order to make room for an illegal shipment of hogs.Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, ‚ÄúThe Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II.‚Äù Journal of Library History, volume 18 (1), page 30. \\"On 24 June 1941, the Nazis captured Vilna. In March 1942, representatives of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg (Rosenberg Operation Group), the body charged with looting Jewish cultural property for the Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage (Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question) in Frankfurt, established a sorting center in the YIVO building. Workers were forced to select the most valuable objects from the collections of YIVO and other local Jewish institutions to be sent to Frankfurt, while the remaining items would be destroyed... A group that was dubbed the ‚Äúpaper brigade‚Äù led by Avrom Sutzkever and Shmerke Kaczerginski, risked their lives daily by hiding material in the building‚Äôs attic or smuggling it into the Vilna ghetto, where they buried it or gave it to non-Jewish contacts for safekeeping. Since it was located outside the ghetto, the YIVO headquarters also served as a transit point for smuggled weapons for the Jewish partisan movement. Such activity continued until the liquidation of the Vilna ghetto in September 1943. Some of the hiding places went undiscovered and the items stored there survived the war, but the YIVO headquarters and its contents were completely destroyed. ‚ÄúHe [Captain Seymour Pomrenze] was instrumental in the restitution of thousands of looted archives, including those of the Strashun Library in Vilna, Lithuania. The library was the premier Jewish library in Europe before World War II, and luckily survived the Nazi destruction of Vilna. The contents of the library, along with those of the YIVO building in Vilna, were looted for eventual placement in the anti-Semitic ‚ÄúInstitute for the Study of the Jewish Question.‚Äù Pomrenze oversaw the return of tens of thousands of items from the Strashun Library to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research headquarters in New York.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn 1954 a depot of 330,000 confiscated books was discovered in the building of a former bank in Vienna. This depot contained also books from Tanzenberg and there was found a part of the library of the famous YIVO in Vilna. With the help of an Austrian-Jewish lawyer called Friedrich Weihsenstein they were returned to the YIVO in New York. The librarian of the IKG wrote lists of the books, but none of the documents mention their numbers and the YIVO in New York was not very cooperative regarding the research.‚Äù  Luxembourg  In Luxembourg, all citizens engaged in ‚Äúculture‚Äù had to register with the German government. This would help in the suppression of dissent, and enforce official censorship. In the ‚ÄúDuty of Registration for All Persons Engaged in Creating or Transmitting Cultural Values in Luxemburg (Verordnungsblatt, No. 15, February 21, 1941, page 109)‚Äù, all writers, authors, publishers, art publishers, copyists and book dealers had to register. Those who refused to register with the occupation government, would be forbidden to practice their arts in the future.Lemkin, Raphael. 1944. Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. Pages 442-443. ‚ÄúIn Luxembourg, non-German reference materials, i.e., French or English were confiscated and replaced by German encyclopaedias. In fact, after 1940, there was an attempt to eliminate all English and French books from collections in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. It was an attempt to seal off occupied countries from the intellectual currents of democracy.‚ÄùKnuth, Rebecca. 2003. Libricide. Page 92.  Malayan Union/Malaysia  ‚Äú‚Ä¶the Japanese looted very thoroughly the head office at Batu Gajah: they removed all the scientific equipment and took away or broke about 5,000 rock slices. Fortunately the rock and mineral collections and the library and records did not fare so badly: eventually they tried to burn down the building, but this was prevented by the Asiatic staff. The district office also suffered badly. A serious loss was the disappearance of a memoir and map ready for publication, as well as all the relevant notes, so a good deal of the country will have to be re-mapped.‚ÄùRastall, R.

It contained important incunabula and books on the occult, which were not available anywhere else in the Netherlands. Other parts of the library and the order‚Äôs archive were of importance as well. The library of the International Institute for Social History in Amsterdam was closed, and the ERR took over the building for its offices.

The library, which has about 150,000 volumes, as well as a very important collection of newspapers, has been taken to Germany. The Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana of the University of Amsterdam, which belongs to the city, has been packed in 153 crates and has also been taken to Germany. Famous collections concerning natural history of the College of St. Ignace at Valkenburg and the Museum of Natural History at Maastricht have also been taken to Germany, as well as the library which belonged to it.

See the site accessed on August 27, 2012: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/06-14-46.asp The German authorities were especially interested in manuscripts of German and Dutch mysticism. Libraries and antiquarian bookstores were combed for special manuscripts of ancient lore. A special search by Dr. W. Grothe and F. Brethauer of the ERR was begun in August 1941. The Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden and Groningen university libraries were searched for manuscripts. Also combed were the Haarlem and Nijmegen municipal libraries, as well as the Fries Genootschap, the Meermanno-Westreenaianum in the Hague, the Nijmegen Municipal Museum and the Haarlem Bishop‚Äôs Archive. Many manuscripts were taken and then later ‚Äúexchanged‚Äù for manuscripts from German and Austrian libraries. If the manuscripts could not be exchanged or purchased, they were copied. The exchanges were sometimes advantageous for the Dutch, but the balance weighed in favor of the Germans, and many times were not unlike forced sales. Although with a legal appearance.Aalders, Gerard. Nazi Looting. Pages 59-61. The German efficiency in selecting and removing these volumes from the occupied countries and sending them back to German is astounding. Also astounding is that many of the major collections remained more or less intact, and were recovered by the Allies at the end of the war. German libraries had preserved many of these Dutch collections as well as their own. As such, much of the Biblioteca Rosenthaliana, the library of the Jewish Portuguese Seminarium of Amsterdam, the books of the Societas Spinozana, the collections of the Freemasonic Groot Orde der Nederlanden, the volumes of the Etz Chaim Seminarium, and twenty Sifre Toroth (plural of Torah) were returned to their country from the Offenbach Archival Depot.  Philippines  * Manila. \\"In the Philippine Islands, the Japanese carried off valuable scientific and other works and then burned nearly every collection within the nation. Almost all of the rich depositories of Filippina materials (books, manuscripts, maps) were burned. In 1945, Manila endured an orgy of murder and rape that killed about 100,000 civilians. By the war‚Äôs end, Manila had also lost the National Library, the University of the Philippines Library, religious archives and many private holdings. \\"  Poland  Destroyed in Warsaw (adjacent to the Blue Palace). Burned down in September, 1939 as a result of severe aerial bombardment by the Germans (incendiary bombing). The surviving collection was later deliberately burned by the Germans in September 1944 Most of the Polish libraries were damaged and suffered losses by German occupation, especially prominent was the destruction of libraries in Warsaw who saw continued bombing by the Germans. Poland faced especially great loses during the early years of the war as the Germans focused on \\"outright destruction of Jewish books and religious artifacts\\". The German's created \\"Bremn-Komman-dos\\" (arson squads) with their main focus being on burning Jewish synagogues and their libraries. What little did survive during the initial bombing and shelling was confiscated during the occupation and transported to Berlin so the German's could study the \\"Jewish Question.\\" When Polish librarians made a report to the International Federation of Librarians Association after the war, they stated that in 1939 there were 22,500,000 volumes in Polish libraries. By the end of the war a total of 15,000,000 of those had been burned, destroyed, or confiscated. This number is believed to be conservative, as it does not account for private collections which would have been destroyed or looted as Jewish families were deported. * Cathedral Library in Poznan (burned) * Central Military Library (burned, 200,000 Books) * Department of Land Forest (Burned, 100,000 volumes and 40,000 maps) * Great Talmudic Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in Lublin (burned, 24,000 volumes moved to Germany and also suffered losses in air raids there) * Krasinski Library (Burned, 70,000 books) * Library of Central Medical Training (Burned, 160,000 books) * Library of the Great Synagogue (Burned, 25,000 books) * Library of the Warsaw Medical Society (Burned, 60,000 books) * National Library in Warsaw (Burned, 700,000 volumes lost including 500 manuscripts from the Rapperswill Collection) * Prz√©zdziecki Library (destroyed) * Raczynski Library (destroyed) * Rapperswil Library (damaged, it held 60,000 volumes) * Science Society Library (destroyed) * Talmudic Academy (Burned, 24,000 volumes) * Warsaw Archives (About 4,700,000 volumes destroyed) * Warsaw Public Library (partially burned, 300,000 volumes lost and 100,000 volumes stolen) * Warsaw University Library (Partially burned, Education Archives all destroyed accounting for over 40,000 volumes lost) * Za≈Çuski Library (Burned, 60,000 books) * Zamoyski Library (Burned, 100,000 books) Around 15 million volumes were lost of a total 22.5 million volumes available.  Serbia  * In April 1941, the National Library of Serbia in Belgrade was completely destroyed as a result of German bombs. About 1,300 Cyrillic Manuscripts from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries were burned as well as important manuscript collections of Serbian authors and scholars. Incunabula and old printed works were also destroyed, as were Serbian books printed between 1832 and 1941.  United Kingdom  England also lost her share of books destroyed during the war. Some 54,000 children‚Äôs books went up in flames during the bombing of England, and thousands of special collections housed in the libraries are gone forever. Of the 1,145,500 books destroyed in the ruins of the bombed libraries, 982,000 were in city libraries; 155,813 belonged to university libraries, and the rest in county libraries.\\"Nazis Burned Books Across the Channel, Too.\\" Christian Science Monitor. 1 October 1945, page 1. * Channel Islands. Although the Germans were never able to actually invade England, the Channel Islands were occupied, and many of their library books were also stolen by the ERR.

It was last active with 46th Test Wing, at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The 46th Test Group was stationed as a tenant unit at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, throughout its existence. It was inactivated on 18 July 2012, being replaced by the 96th Test Group in an administrative reorganization. History The Group served as the Air Force‚Äôs liaison with the United States Army White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), interfacing with the U.S. Army and Test Center organizations. In addition, the unit provided test sponsorship for all Air Force programs testing on WSMR, assisted test program customers in preparing the documentation necessary to execute tests as well as obtaining logistic and test support resources. The 46 TG also scheduled airspace for all Air Force tests and Air Force tactical training on WSMR. On August 1, 1970, per Air Force Systems Command Special Order G-94, the Air Force Missile Development Center at Holloman AFB was inactivated and the Tactical Air Command assumed host responsibilities for the facility. Associate units and programs transferred to other locations within Air Force Systems Command. The inactivation resulted in the loss of more than 450 military and 570 civilian positions. The Test & Evaluation activities that remained were the Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility (CIGTF), the High Speed Test Track, the Radar Target Scatter Facility (RATSCAT), and the Target Drone Facility. These organizations were combined to form the nucleus of a Holloman AFB tenant organization, the 6585th Test Group In 1976, AFSWC was disestablished, and the 6585th Test Group at Holloman became part of the 3246th Test Wing, Armament Development and Test Center (ADTC) at Eglin AFB, FL. The Group was inactivated on 30 September 1992 as part of a reorganization, with personnel and equipment being assigned to the new 46th Test Group at Holloman, upon activation it was transferred the 6585th's personnel, equipment and mission. It was inactivated as a result of an organizational realignment at Eglin AFB, being replaced at Holloman by the new 96th Test Group. =Lineage= * Designated as the 6585th Test Group : Activated on 1 August 1970 : Redesignated 46th Test Group on 1 October 1992 : Inactivated on 18 July 2012 =Assignments= * Air Force Special Weapons Center, 1 Aug 1970 * Armament Development and Test Center (later, Armament Division), 1 Oct 1975 * 3246th Test Wing, 1 Jan 1984 * 46th Test Wing, 1 Oct 1992 ‚Äì 18 July 2012 =Components= * 46th Guidance Test Squadron (later 746th Test Squadron), 8 September 1993 ‚Äì 18 July 2012 : Also known as the Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility (CIGTF), the 746 TS is the DOD¬¥s designated Responsible Test Organization (RTO) chartered to test and evaluate GPS user equipment (UE) and integrated GPS based guidance and navigation systems.

Part of the complex, including the remarkable pharmacy, are now the Museo delle arti sanitarie of Naples. History Originally built in Renaissance style, the complex incorporated in the structures of the churches of Santa Maria del Popolo and Santa Maria Succurre Miseris dei Bianchi, as well as the ospedale (hospital) of Santa Maria del Popolo degli Incurabili. In time, it also incorporated the adjacent S. Maria delle Grazie Maggiore a Caponapoli and its cloister, the monastery of Santa Maria della Consolazione, the church of Santa Maria di Gerusalemme and the cloister of the Trentatr√©. The hospital was founded in 1521 by Maria Lorenza Longo after she became paralyzed by a malady. Among the main donors of the next century was the merchant Gaspar Roomer. In the 19th century, donors included Professor Cotugno and Signore Marchetti of Messina.A New Guide of Naples, Its Environs, Procida, Ischia and Capri, by Giovanni Battista de Ferrari, (Naples, 1826) page 309 Pharmacy Interior In the mid 18th century, Antonio Maggiocca was the patron for the building of the pharmacy. The structure was designed by Bartolomeo Vecchione. Maggiocca‚Äôs marble bust inside was sculpted by Matteo Bottiglieri in 1750. The pharmacy remains, generally intact with cabinets and nearly 400 maiolica vases (albarelli) for compounds, made by Lorenzo Salandra and Donato Massa. The tiled floors were made by Giuseppe Massa. The ceiling was frescoed by Pietro Bardellino. The Pharmacy consists of a grand salon, an entrance room, and a small laboratory. The latter is decorated in stucco and has an elaborate table by the woodworker Agostino Fucito. Church of Santa Maria del Popolo The renaissance style funereal monument by the main altar was completed by Giovanni da Nola. The Frescoes in the church were completed by Giuliano Bugiardini, Marco Cardisco, Francesco De Mura, Marco Pino, Giovanni Battista Rossi, and Carlo Sellitto. In the Cappella Montalto is an altarpiece by Girolamo D'Auria. The sacristy was frescoed by Giovanni Battista Rossi. Church of Santa Maria dei Bianchi Church of Congregation of the Bianchi della Giustizia The church of Santa Maria dei Bianchi (or Congregation of the Bianchi della Giustizia) was a church build by a white-robed confraternity attached to the complex, and whose role was the assistance to those condemned to death. The church was founded in 1473. In 1673, it was restored in Baroque style by Dionisio Lazzari. Much of the church as well as the pharmacy now is in poor state. The main altar has a statue of the Virgin by Giovanni da Nola, while the ceiling was frescoed by Giovanni Battista Beinaschi. The sacristy has frescoes by Paolo De Matteis depicting members of the confraternity. References Bibliography *Antonio Terraciano, Andrea Russo, Le chiese di Napoli.

It was designed by A. L. & G. McCredie and built from 1858 to 1910. It is also known as Toxteth Cottage. The property is owned by Co-operative for Aborigines Ltd. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Since 1958 the house and grounds have been the main campus of Tranby Aboriginal College.Tranby Aboriginal College Retrieved 13 August 2012  History  =History of the area= The Leichhardt area was originally inhabited by the Wangal clan of Aborigines. After 1788 diseases such as smallpox and the loss of their hunting grounds caused huge reductions in their numbers and they moved further inland. Since European settlement the foreshores of Blackwattle Bay and Rozelle Bay have developed a unique maritime, industrial and residential character - a character which continues to evolve as areas which were originally residential estates, then industrial areas, are redeveloped for residential units and parklands. The first formal grant in the Glebe area was a grant to Richard Johnson, the colony's first chaplain, in 1789. The Glebe (land allocated for the maintenance of a church minister) comprised rolling shale hills covering sandstone, with several sandstone cliff faces. The ridges were drained by several creeks including Blackwattle Creek, Orphan School Creek and Johnston Creek. Extensive swampland surrounded the creeks. On the shale ridges, heavily timbered woodlands contained several varieties of eucalypts while the swamplands and tidal mudflats had mangroves, swamp oaks (Casuarina glauca) and blackwattles (Callicoma serratifolia) after which the bay is named. Blackwattle Swamp was first mentioned by surveyors in the 1790s and Blackwattle Swamp Bay in 1807. By 1840 it was called Blackwattle Bay. Boat parties collected wattles and reeds for the building of huts, and kangaroos and emus were hunted by the early settlers who called the area the Kangaroo Ground. Rozelle Bay is thought to have been named after a schooner which once moored in its waters. Johnson's land remained largely undeveloped until 1828, when the Church and School Corporation subdivided it into 28 lots, three of which they retained for church use.City Plan Heritage, 2005, quoting Max Solling & Peter Reynolds \\"Leichhardt: On the Margins of the City\\", 1997, 14 The Church sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around Broadway. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abattoirs were built there from the 1860s. When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti-municipal clashes in the streets. From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests. Reclaiming the swamp, Wentworth Park opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways. Up until the 1950s Sydney was the location for working class employment - it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour-intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets moved in in the 1970s.

The cottage was the residence of Allen's daughter Mary and her husband George Allen Mansfield. Mansfield was the son of Ralph Mansfield, a Wesleyan Minister and the secretary of the Australian Gas Light Company from 1837 to 1879. He and Mary lived in the house until 1861. The cottage became known as Tranby in the 1870s when Allen's other daughter Elizabeth and her husband William Binnington Boyce lived there.

In 1910 additions were made to the house to accommodate William Allen's large family.Cracknell and Lonergan 1994: 5-13 In 1931 Tranby became a hostel for the University of Sydney and was the home of John Hope of the Christ Church St Laurence. The property remained in the Boyce Allen family until 1946. In 1957 Tranby became a Training Centre for the \\"development of co-operative practices for Aboriginies\\", under the control of the Australian Board of Missions Christian Community Co-operative.Cracknell and Lonergan 1994: 14 In 1971 the name \\"Tranby Co-operative for Aboriginies Ltd.\\" was registered. Tranby is now an Aboriginal managed, community based, non-profit co-operative with the college forming the largest part of the facility. It is a meeting place for senior community members and has been the scene of key issues in the history of indigenous activism, including meetings which led to the Royal Commission into Black Deaths in Custody.Cracknell and Lonergan 1994: 18-19 The site is currently undergoing redevelopment to accommodate the increasing demands on community and educational programmes.  Description  Tranby is a post- Regency style cottage, designed on an asymmetrical plan. It retains the low lines and broad proportions of early colonial dwellings. The front elevation describes three stages of building. The original section, containing six rooms, is central to the facade describing a Georgian character recessed into the whole. A central door opening and French doors either side open to a verandah which is supported by cast iron columns. The front verandah is flanked on either side by later editions. The later edition of a smaller parapet-fronted wing adds an Italianate flavour to the whole. The whole is covered with a slate hipped roof with metal ridge capping and box gutters. Wall fabric varies from cement rendered brick ashlar, to sandstone lime rendered ashlar coursing. Tranby has fifteen rooms. = Condition = Generally sound structural condition. = Modifications and dates = *1880s - northern wing addition *1910 - eastern wing addition  Heritage listing  As at 1 October 1997, Tranby and its history can be viewed as reflecting the evolutionary changes which took place on the Glebe Peninsula in architecture, land allocation and the growth and diversity of society.

Life  He was first mentioned as a count in 941. In 960, he was mentioned as count in the Radenzgau. In 961, he appears as count on the lower Raab and in 973 as count in the Volkfeld shire. After successful battles in Bohemia and Hungary, he is named as margrave in 976. In 980, he appears as count in eastern Franconia. His background is disputed. The most likely theory is that he was a son (or grandson) of Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria. That would make him a member of the Luitpolding dynasty. Another theory sees him as the son of Arnulf's brother Berthold, Duke of Bavaria, which would still make him out to be a Luitpolding. This linkage with the Luitpoldings would explain the Schweinfurts' connection with Bavaria. Yet another theory puts him into the Popponids family. It is certain that his brother, or nephew, Leopold I, Margrave of Austria was the founder of the Austrian House of Babenberg. The name 'Leopold' is a modernization of 'Luitpold', and would strengthen the argument for ties with the Luitpoldingers. The Bertholdus who was mentioned in 941, was tasked by Emperor Otto I with guarding Lothar II, Count of Walbeck, who had been taken prisoner. Lothar was pardoned the following year, and Berthold married his daughter Eilika (d. 19 August 1015). She later initiated the construction of the minster in Schweinfurt, where she was buried. In 964, Berthold was tasked by Otto with guarding another prisoner, King Berengar II of Italy, who was kept prisoner in Bamberg. In 973, Berthold participated in the ousting of the rebellious Henry II, Duke of Bavaria.  Marriage and issue  Berthold was married to Eilika of Walbeck, daughter of Lothar II, Count of Walbeck. They had at least two children: * Henry of Schweinfurt (d. 18 September 1017), who was Berthold's heir * Bucco, who was mentioned in 1003 In 1010, a lady named Eilika was abbess of Niedernburg Abbey in Passau. It is thought this Eilika may have been a daughter of Berthold and his wife.

Daniel Baldwin Building, is a skyscraper located in Erie, Pennsylvania in the United States. Intended to be the headquarters for the largest bank in Erie, the Erie Trust Company Building was designed by the firm Dennison and Hiron in 1925. Completed in 1928 at the climax of the Roaring Twenties, the building's namesake bank failed in 1933 after the start of the Great Depression. It was renamed the G. Daniel Baldwin Building in 1943. In 1996, it became Renaissance Centre and was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 2000.  Design  Renaissance Centre is located in downtown Erie at the intersection of State Street, the main north-south thoroughfare in Erie, and East 10th Street. It is the city's sole skyscraper and dominates the city skyline. Renaissance Centre has a height of and is the tallest \\"multi-story building\\" in Erie, Pennsylvania, but second-tallest overall; the central spire of St. Peter Cathedral is taller at . The building itself is deep, wide, and has a footprint of . The first three floors on the north and west fronts of Renaissance Centre are faced with Indiana limestone while the remaining floors are clad in \\"light buff-colored\\" brick. Its main entrance on State Street consists of multiple, set-back arches that rise one-and-a-half stories up the facade. The building's name is engraved on a faux-limestone sign mounted above the archway. Starting at the 11th floor, the building is setback. Unlike the north and west, the south and east facades are relatively unadorned; the central window bays on the southern side are recessed causing the entire building to take on a \\"shallow 'U'-shape\\" when viewed from above. Renaissance Centre has a total floor space of spread across its 14 floors. Originally, the first floor comprised the bank lobby, but has been divvied up into an atrium and retail spaces for businesses. Six murals by New York-painter Edward A. Turnbull depicting historical events from Erie history were located on the first floor; five remain, but were hidden by renovations. The 14th floor offers views of Presque Isle State Park, Lake Erie and, on clear days, Long Point, Canada.  History  Shortly after the passage of the National Bank Act by Congress in 1864, several banks were chartered in Erie. One of these, Dime Savings and Loan, was founded in 1866; it was reorganized as the Erie Trust Company in 1902. The economic boom following World War I set off a flurry of building activity in downtown Erie, including a ten-story skyscraper at 12th and State Streets. By the mid-1920s, the Erie Trust Company had become the dominant banking institution in the city and needed space to expand. The bank hired the New York City-architectural firm Dennison and Hirons in 1925 to design its new headquarters--the firm also designed the Home Savings Bank Building in Albany, New York. The Erie Trust Company Building was completed in 1928 at a cost of $2 million. A year later, the stock market crashed sparking the Great Depression, and, by 1933, the Erie Trust Company went bankrupt. Its remnants and that of another defunct bank were reorganized into the National Bank and Trust, which continued to occupy its former headquarters now owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The state auctioned off the Erie Trust Company Building in 1943 in a bankruptcy court and was acquired by the Tenth Street Building Corporation, a local real estate company, for $377,000. The building was renamed after company's president at the time, G. Daniel Baldwin, in 1945; Baldwin died the next year. National Bank and Trust continued to lease the first floor, along with offices on the third, until it was taken over by First National Bank in 1951; First National maintained a presence in the Baldwin Building until the 1980s. Despite its owners operating a \\"large and profitable\\" business, the occupancy in the building decreased to less than 30 percent in the 1970s and 1980s. The G. Daniel Baldwin Building was, again, put up for auction in June 1996\\\\. The Tenth Street Building Corporation donated the building to the Greater Erie Charity Golf Classic where it sold to local developer Tom Kennedy for $315,000 with the proceeds going to charity. Kennedy also owns and oversaw the development of the Palace Hardware Building into apartments and a business center. The Baldwin Building was renamed Renaissance Centre as part of the effort to revitalize the building; a new sign, fashioned to resemble its limestone cladding, was installed over the old name. From its purchase in 1996 to late 1998, Renaissance Centre underwent a $2.2 million restoration. Renaissance Centre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 10, 2000.

It is currently part of the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description Inspired by the French impressionists, Hassam used varying brushstrokes, bold color, and confident free handling of the medium. Blue ocean reflects onto the large, sun-bleached rock, while distant shores beyond are barely hinted at with lines of cream and green. Broken brushstrokes suggest shadows and reflections of the water. Historical information Hassam, like many American painters at the turn of the century, studied in Paris for three years. He adopted the impressionist style as his own, and worked closely with other American Impressionists such as Mary Cassatt. H is often hailed as a pure example of the American Impressionist movement. A native New Endlander, Hassam heavily favored the New England area for his work, and spent his time painting much of the Atlantic Coast.

It argues that since the Earth has entered an age--the Anthropocene--in which several of its systems are in the control of humanity, and that it is now up to humans to use this power wisely. The book challenges several beliefs usually held by environmentalists, arguing that technology like nuclear power and genetic engineering are useful and necessary tools to keep the Earth system within planetary boundaries, and that the Green movement's insistence on lifestyle changes and opposition to economic growth are unlikely to work.

The song reached No. 3 on the Christian Songs chart.Billboard 3/10/2012  Composition  The duo described the song as \\"really a universal cry of humanity for something greater than ourselves...[People think they've] got it all sorted out, and life will deal you those blows. This song is that cry saying, 'God, Father, hold onto me, don't let me lose my way.'\\"For King & Country: From Rebecca St James sidemen to CCM success They said the song was inspired by Matthew 11:29-30, which says, \\"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\\" Luke Smallbone said, \\"When we were writing this song, that Matthew 11 passage came to mind. When we go through life it's so hectic and get beaten down and we go through so many trials. The truth is that we have a Father who is waiting to hold onto us. He's someone we can rest in and He gives us that perfect peace. That's what I love about the song, the verses are talking about real life. The chorus is just crying out to God. There comes those defining moments in each of our lives where we so severely need someone to hold on to us. It seems we are all, in different ways, shapes and forms, busted to some degree. This song is an honest confession: I can‚Äôt do this thing called life on my own. I need something, or more specifically, someone greater than myself to hold on to me.\\"#296 - \\"Busted Heart\\" by for KING & COUNTRY  References  Category:2011 singles Category:For King & Country (band) songs Category:2011 songs Category:Songs written by Ben Glover Category:Warner Music Group singles ","title":"Busted Heart (Hold On to Me)"},{"id":"36704975","text":"Omran Mohamed Al Jesmi is a UAE football Defender who played for United Arab Emirates in the 2004 Asian Cup.

George Campbell (Cam) Tinning, known as Campbell Tinning, (February 25, 1910 ‚Äì February 28, 1996) was a Canadian painter, graphic designer, muralist, and illustrator. He was an Official Canadian War Artist in World War Two; the only one born in Saskatchewan. After the war, he resided in Montreal but travelled extensively and painted in every Canadian province, the United States, Jamaica, Italy, France, England and Scotland. In 1970, he was elected a full member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Early life Tinning was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, on February 25, 1910. He studied art in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Regina, Saskachetwan. In 1938, he attended the Eliot O'Hara School of watercolour in Maine and the Art Students League of New York. He moved to Montreal and in 1940 became a member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour. He exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1940, he was employed as a graphic designer at The Robert Simpson Company (Simpson's department store) at its St. Catherine Street location in downtown Montreal. In 1942 and 1948, he was awarded the Jessie Dow Prize for watercolour at the Art Association of Montreal. World War II After serving in the Reserves, Tinning enlisted in the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) in 1942 as a private. In 1943, he was appointed official war artist with the Historical Section of National Defense Headquarters as a Lieutenant. Posted to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, he painted east coast military installations throughout 1943. He was sent overseas and served in England, Italy, and the Netherlands. He was promoted to Captain in 1945 and returned to Canada where he was honorably discharged in 1946. He completed over 500 pieces as a Canadian War artist which are now in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. Post-War Tinning settled in Montreal where he established his studio. In 1949, he travelled and painted in Newfoundland for two months. He exhibited these watercolours at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and published an article on his experiences in Canada's newest province. From 1948 to 1953, Tinning illustrated travel articles for the Lincoln-Mercury Times, a magazine published by the Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan. Notably, one of these was written by Aldous Huxley in 1951 on Lydiard Tregoz, a house in a village in Wiltshire, England. In the 1950s and 1960s, Tinning completed graphic designs for the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Montreal. Apart from some prestigious patrons of the English Montreal establishment, many banks, hotels, stores, and factories commissioned works by Tinning. A series of template watercolours inspired by a French-Canadian legend was designed for rooms at the Manoir Baie Comeau, Quebec, in the 1960s; they were later destroyed by fire. Tinning‚Äôs 1960 mural for the Jenkins Valve Company in Lachine, Quebec, was destroyed during demolition of the factory in 2004, though photos of the mural are available and . Sketches for this mural are preserved at the Lachine Museum in Lachine, Quebec. In 1960, the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Montreal commissioned Tinning to design the Maritime Bar. The hotel, renovated and reopened in 2012, still owns about 60 of his works. In 1953 he was elected an Associate Member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and he became a Full Member in 1970. Although Montreal remained his home and was his constant inspiration, Tinning also enjoyed rural Quebec ‚Äì especially the Eastern Townships around Lake Memphramagog. He frequently visited family in the Okanagan and painted in this region of British Columbia. In the 1970s Tinning experimented with abstract compositions. He painted floral still life throughout his career and it was his most popular genre. Tinning had solo exhibits at many galleries across Canada including the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1942 and Walter Klinkhoff Gallery, Montreal, Quebec in 1963. During the 1980s and 1990s his war art paintings were included a numerous group exhibitions such as Canadian Artists of the Second World War at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, 1981, The Sweetest Spring at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, 1989, and Victory Parade: Canadian War Artists in Holland 1944-45 at the Legermuseum in Delft, Netherlands, 1991. In 1994 Tinning held his last solo exhibition at the Dominion Gallery, Montreal, two years before his death. His works are in many public collections, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and the Canadian War Museum. Tinning died in Montreal on February 28, 1996. Posthumously There have been three exhibits of the work of Campbell Tinning since his death. The Moose Jaw Museum and Art Gallery curated a solo exhibition of Tinning war art in 1999 and more recently The Newfoundland Paintings.

He was also the first Scot to win the Wimbledon title since Harold Mahony in 1896. Djokovic had advanced to the final after an epic and gruelling five-set semifinal against Juan Mart√≠n del Potro. At 4 hours and 43 minutes this match made history as the then-longest semifinal ever contested at Wimbledon, breaking the previous record set by Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl, both at one time coaches of Djokovic and Murray respectively, at the 1989 Championships. Roger Federer was the defending champion but he lost in the second round in a huge upset to world No. 116 Sergiy Stakhovsky from Ukraine. Stakhovsky was unable to build on his effort and lost in the next round in 4 sets to J√ºrgen Melzer. Federer's loss marked the first time since the 2004 French Open, when he lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the third round, that he had failed to reach at least the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam event. It was also Federer's earliest exit in this tournament since 2002, and the first time that Federer lost to a player ranked lower than 100 since his loss to then world No. 101 Richard Gasquet at the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters. In the first round, world No. 135 Steve Darcis had already produced another of the biggest upsets in recent years by defeating world No. 5 and two-time Wimbledon champion Rafael Nadal in straight sets. This came a year after Nadal's equally big upset in the second round of the 2012 Championships against Luk√°≈° Rosol. It was the first time that Nadal had lost in the first round of a Grand Slam tournament. There was no follow-up match from Darcis as he withdrew from the tournament because of a right shoulder injury he sustained during the Nadal match. Federer and Nadal both exiting the tournament early made this the first time since the 2004 French Open that neither of them appeared in the quarterfinals of a grand slam. Further history was made at the championships for American and Polish players: for the first time since the 1912 Wimbledon Championships no American men advanced past the second round; and for the first time ever a Polish man made it to the semifinal stage of a Grand Slam after Jerzy Janowicz defeated countryman ≈Åukasz Kubot in the quarterfinals.

Programming started with classical music, daily news were not allowed to be broadcast to protect the newspaper producers. However, near the end of the 1920s, the political influence started to affect the medium radio as well. After 1933, Germany started transmitting propaganda directed at Austria, which was countered by the local radio stations. After Austria joined Germany in 1938, the Austrian radio stations became part of the German radio network. =Post-WWII= The Funkhaus in Vienna After the end of World War II, the studio was located inside the Soviet occupation zone, so the programming had a small but noticeable Soviet influence. The other three occupation forces started their own programming as well, which competed with each other causing a huge variety of different radio stations for that time. After Austria became independent again in 1955, programming consisted of three national radio stations, transmitted via mediumwave and FM. Because the government refused to raise the radio fees, the third program had to be closed due to lack of money in 1962. Only in 1966, after a new law was enacted, could programming restart with three programs - √ñ1, √ñ2 and √ñ3. Soon, the decision was made to abandon mediumwave, not just due to the lack of frequencies in Austria, but also because the alpine terrain proved to be difficult to cover by mediumwave. By 1976, only 80% of the population was covered by mediumwave at daytime, at night this number fell to 65%. Therefore, all medium wave stations were shut off, with the exception of the frequency 1476 kHz from Vienna (Sendeanlage Bisamberg) to cover Czechoslovakia. As well, a shortwave transmitter in Aldrans was used until the 80s to cover the deep Tyrolean valleys which couldn't be reached by mediumwave or FM. Especially √ñ3 was innovative with their pop music format, which was unusual in Europe in the 60s and 70s. It caused a huge popularity of the station, as well as the Austropop music genre. In 1979, Blue Danube Radio was launched to target the various United Nations personnel present in Austria. In the 1980s, because commercial radio stations were still illegal, the first radio stations started to broadcast from foreign territory, especially South Tyrol and the former Socialist countries in the east. In 1993, the European Union condemned Austria for forbidding commercial radio stations and thus violating free speech rights. In July 1993, the monopoly of √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk was softened, allowing the launch of the first commercial radio stations in 1995. It took until 1997 for the ban on commercial radio stations to be lifted completely, and in 1998 several new stations launched in Austria. Like in Germany, radio in Austria was completely separated by state, allowing radio stations to transmit in one state only. A law change 2001 allowed licenses for country- wide radio stations to be given out. So far, the only such license is owned by KroneHit.

Tarbell, created in 1907. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description A young woman, identified as Charlotte Barton of Boston, sits in a green patterned chair, adjusting her pearl-tipped hatpin in a gilded mirror. A corner of Vermeer‚Äôs The Music Lesson can be seen in the upper right corner. She is dressed very elegantly, and, as suggested by the title, is going out to the matinee. The loose brushstrokes of her shirt, hair, and hat are elegantly contrasted with the solidness of the chair she is sitting in. Historical information Born, raised, and educated in and around the Boston, Massachusetts area, Tarbell was interested in the lives of the women who lived in the area. Tarbell was the leader of the Boston School, a group of artists who painted women in interior and exterior settings, usually active in mundane, domestic activities. Using impressionist techniques, they bring to life these seemingly dull activities with their lively brushstrokes. Tarbell concentrated on the world of upper-class women, depicting them elegantly in the latest fashions. These women exemplified the Boston Brahmin lifestyle. =Acquisition= The painting was originally purchased by Washington University in Saint Louis in 1909, and loaned to the City Art Museum. It was sold by the Kende Galleries in New York in 1945 to the J.W. Young Art Gallery at Chicago. John G.

The film garnered attention after being praised and promoted by several acclaimed directors. Attakathi fetched positive reviews and emerged successful at the box office.  Plot  Dinakaran (Dinesh) referred as Atta among his friends is a regular semi-urban teenager growing up in a small village in the outskirts of Chennai. He did well in his school exams, but failed his English paper. Rather than studying for the second attempt, he wastes time looking for a girlfriend since he has made a pact with his best friends; to fall in love and get married. Dinakaran first falls for a girl he meets at the bus stop named Poornima (Nandita Swetha). She appears to like him too as she smiles at him and accepts his gifts. But when he goes after her, she suddenly refers to him as 'elder brother' and tells him to stop following her around as she feels awkward. Dinakaran tries to feel sad, but he cannot since he was never really in love in the first place. It was just an infatuation. Dinakaran next starts wooing a distant relative who comes visiting at his house. Unfortunately, she turns out to have fallen in love with his elder brother. He then gets beaten up by the boys at a neighboring village for following two of their girls. He learns martial arts to protect himself and impress the girls, but nothing of that sort works out. Dinakaran finally gives up on falling in love and concentrates on his studies. He finally passes his English test and enrolls into the local college. He is taken under the wing of an overprotective senior, who is the self-proclaimed underground student leader whom everyone refers to as 'route thala' or designated don of a route/street. Dinakaran's life takes a sudden turn as he mixes with the wrong group. He becomes less sociable and is always involved in fights and other problems. When his senior finally graduates, he makes Dinakaran the next 'route thala.' Dinakaran takes his responsibility very seriously and is soon both respected and feared by all the students in his college. One day, Dinakaran gets a new junior in the form of Poornima, his childhood friend and one of the girls he tried to woo as a teenager. He tries to avoid her as it reminds him of the time he was a complete loser who was constantly humiliated by his own feeble attempts to impress girls. As time passes, he cannot avoid falling in love with Poornima, especially when she shows him an old bus ticket he bought for her. She only keeps things from people she really like as a kind of memorabilia. Dinakaran is convinced that she is in love with him too, but cannot bring himself to propose to her. He even changes back to his old haircut and the usual way he used to dress just because Poornima likes it more. His family and friends tease him, which embarrasses him deeply. But once Poornima complements him on his new look, he does not mind anymore. Things take a turn for the worse when Poornima's family finds out she is in love with someone they disapprove of and they fix an arranged marriage for her. Dinakaran panics and recruits his old friends to help him out. His parents seemingly allow him to leave home and bless his actions. Most of his friend decide to arrange for Dinakaran to elope with Poornima with the help of their relatives, though one of them disagrees as he feels they should ask Poornima how she really feels and then decide what they should do. However, Dinakaran becomes impatient and goes after Poornima, only to face her elder brother in an ensuing fight. Dinakaran manage to escape and waits for Poornima at the place they had arranged to meet, but she never shows up. Dinakaran then takes the public bus back home, where he meets Poornima. As it turns out, she was never in love with Dinakaran in the first place. Her lover was another boy named Dinakaran, which made her family assume he was the one she was in love with all the while. While her family was busy going after Dinakaran, Poornima had already married the other Dinakaran and was now on the way to watch a movie with her newly wedded husband. Dinakaran is heartbroken, but cannot stay sad forever, and bounces back quickly as he soon realizes he was never in love with Poornima at all, it was all just a phase of infatuation once again. Post-credits it reveals that Dinakaran studied hard and managed to become a teacher, while taking care of his mother and has finally tied the knot.

He was listed after Sulili and before Akiya. Kikkia's name is given as the second of a group of rulers ‚Äú(named) on bricks whose eponyms are not found\\", suggesting that he had preceded the period in which the annually-elected limmu officials had been appointed and given their names to the years. Consequently, the length of his reign is undetermined. Apart from his appearance in two copies of the Assyrian King List (the Khorsabad and SDAS copies, but not the Nassouhi one which is damaged at the top where he might have appeared), he is only known from two building inscriptions of his successors, moreover; the earliest of these is that of Ashur-rim-nisheshu (c. 1398 BC ‚Äî c. 1391 BC), who commemorated his reconstruction of the wall of the inner-city of Assur by listing the previous restorers on a commemorative cone,Cone VAT? 2764. (beginning with Kikkia.) The later king, Shalmaneser II, restored this wall and gave credit to his predecessor in his inscription. The erection of a defensive wall suggests that Kikkia may have won his independence from the waning influence of the Neo- Sumerian Empire. An earlier Assyrian ≈°akkanakkum (KI≈†.NITA2) and chief magistrate of Assur, Zariqum, who had been omitted from the extant copies of the Assyrian King Lists, had been a contemporary and vassal of Shulgi (c. 2029 BC ‚Äî c. 1982 BC) and of Amar-Sin of Ur (c. 1981 BC ‚Äî c. 1973 BC), so one would suppose that Kikkia must have reigned after this time. Arthur Ungnad interpreted Kikkia's name, and that of Ushpia, as being that of the Hurrian language (BA VI, 5, S. 13), but more recent research no longer holds this thesis as tenable, and Arno Poebel was not convinced by the interpretation.Arno Poebel, The Assyrian King List from Khorsabad, Journal of Near Eastern Studies 1/3, 1942, 253 See also * Timeline of the Assyrian Empire * Early Period of Assyria * List of Assyrian kings * Assyrian continuity * Assyrian people * Assyria Inscriptions References Category:20th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:20th- century BC rulers ","title":"Kikkia"},{"id":"36705198","text":"Prospertown is an unincorporated community located within the New Jersey townships of Jackson and Plumsted in Ocean County and Upper Freehold in Monmouth County.Locality Search, State of New Jersey.

His medal was later revoked before he died as he was a civilian, but was reinstated in 1989. He was of mixed white and Native American ancestry, and married Mary Longneck, a Cheyenne woman, maintaining Native American customs throughout his life. In 2012, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Military Hall of Fame. Biography Chapman was born in 1837 in Michigan, to white and Native American parents. He began acting as a scout for the U.S. Army and settlers in the 1860s. In 1868 he moved to Oklahoma, and was attached to the Seventh Cavalry during General Alfred Sully's actions against the Cheyenne out of Fort Dodge. Subsequently, Camp Supply was set up and Chapman worked there as an interpreter. A Kiowa ledger drawing possibly depicting the Buffalo Wallow battle in 1874 He married Mary Longneck, the daughter of the Cheyenne Chief Stone Calf, and had six children with her. He lived for a time with her tribe. In July 1874, he volunteered to scout for the U.S. Army once more, and scouted for Lt. Frank Baldwin. On September 12, he was involved in an action which would earn him a Medal of Honor. Chapman, fellow civilian Billy Dixon and four soldiers were confronted with a force of over a hundred Comanches and Kiowas. At Battle of Buffalo wallow, as it became known, the small group made its way to a defensive position in a buffalo wallow, where it held out until the weather caused the Native American force to break off their attack. What happened during the battle is disputed. At one point either Dixon or Chapman was injured and stranded outside of the wallow and the other ventured out to retrieve his fellow scout. Chapman's story goes that he pulled Dixon up onto his back, and had to stop on his return several times to eliminate the Native Americans who were attempting to shoot him and Dixon. With a quarter of a mile to go before they reached the wallow, Chapman was shot in shin on his right leg, which shattered the bone. He continued to drag himself and Dixon the rest of the way back to the wallow, whilst under fire. However, Dixon's story is that Chapman was already injured and Dixon retrieved him and pulled him back to the wallow. Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles would later say of Chapman's actions that they were \\"one of the bravest deeds in the annals of the army.\\" Chapman's leg was amputated by a surgeon at Camp Supply, and all the survivors were awarded a Medal of Honor. Chapman subsequently wore a prosthetic leg, and continued to serve as camp interpreter during the commotion following the Dull Knife Fight in 1879. The Native Americans referred to him as Tam-e-yukh-tah, which translated as \\"the man with the cut off leg\\". He later retired from service and settled with his wife and family near Seiling, Oklahoma. He reportedly still slept on occasion in a teepee. Chapman would visit Miles annually in Washington. He died on July 18, 1925 as a result of injuries suffered from a wagon accident. He was due to speak as part of the lyceum circuit at the time of his death. He was buried in Brumfield Cemetery, Dewey County, Oklahoma. Medal of Honor and legacy Chapman's medal was revoked in a review in 1916‚Äì17, along with several other awards made to civilian scouts. It was restored in 1989. His citation reads \\"The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Civilian Scout Amos Chapman, a United States Civilian, for gallantry in action on 12 September 1874, while serving as an Indian Scout with the 6th U.S. Cavalry, at Washita River, Texas.\\" He was admitted into the Oklahoma Military Hall of Fame as one of the 2012 inductees.

Design and development The H-22B-3 was one of the first gliders to be built in Japan after World War II. Its open fuselage structure and overall simplicity was similar to the pre- war Z√∂gling and its descendants but it was larger and had tandem seating. Many deaths and injuries have been ascribed to the pre-war practice of using single seat primary gliders. The H-22B-3's designer, Ikuo Horikawa, was a director of the Hagiwara Glider Company which built it. The H-22B-3 has a simple wooden two spar wing of constant chord and dihedral 1¬∞ 20', covered with fabric. The wing is high mounted, braced to the lower fuselage by a pair of V-form struts on both sides. Upper surface spoilers are fitted. The fuselage of the H-22B-3 is constructed from steel tube with a fabric covered nacelle extending forward from about the wing trailing edge. This contains the two open, under wing, tandem cockpits. Aft, the uncovered fuselage has two members, one directly above the other and interconnected by a series of diagonal stiffening tubes. The lower longitudinal member slopes slightly upwards, tapering the fuselage in profile. This tail boom is stiffened with bracing wires to the wing spars. The rearmost section of the fuselage can be fabric covered but there is no other fixed fin. The tail unit is wooden with fabric covering and both vertical and horizontal surfaces are roughly rectangular. The tailplane is attached to the upper fuselage beam far enough forward for the rudder, which extends to the keel, to need only a small cut-out in the elevators. The H-22B-3 lands on a fixed monowheel, assisted by a rubber sprung skid under the nacelle and a tail bumper. The H-22B-3 was flown for the first time in August 1953. By 1966 at least 30 had been produced, though production may have ended earlier.

A modified version, first flown in 1966, was produced in modest numbers. Design and development The original Mita 3 was designed and built by the Kirigamine Glider Manufacturing Co and flown in 1962. It was then developed and produced in an improved version, the kai 1, by the Light Aircraft Development Co. (L.A.D.) with production later taken over in turn by the Tainan Industry Co., so that the aircraft is also known as the Tainan Mita 3. The kai 1 first flew in 1966. The Mita 3 is of mixed steel and wood construction, largely covered with plywood and fabric. The shoulder wing is in three pieces, with an unswept, straight leading edge and a centre panel of constant chord; the outer panels are straight tapered. All panels are built around plywood covered single box spars. The Mita designer, Asahi Miyahara, chose a NACA series 6 airfoil, popular at the time, which aimed to optimise laminar flow. The ailerons and the rear wing surfaces are fabric covered and the outer panels are demountable for transportation, the joints covered with aluminium fairings. The wing tips are glass-plastic mouldings. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, located near mid-chord at the ends of the centre section, extend both above and below the wings. The fuselage of the Mita 3 is steel framed with wooden stringers, polygonal in cross-section and fabric covered apart from a glass reinforced plastic (GRP) nose cone and a short GRP dorsal fairing behind the cockpit. The rear of the single piece, starboard side hinged canopy rises upwards above the rear fuselage line, allowing the instructor to be placed above the pupil pilot in the front seat, with an upper and two small side transparencies to assist his view. The fuselage tapers gently rearwards to the straight tapered tail surfaces; the tailplane is mounted on the top of the fuselage and is, like the wing, a ply box structure with fabric covering aft and carrying fabric covered elevators with a cut out for rudder movement. The fin is similarly plywood skinned, with a small GRP fillet; the rudder, which extends to the keel, is fabric covered, mass balanced and has a GRP tip. The Mita 3 lands on a fixed, rubber sprung monowheel undercarriage and a fixed tailskid. Operational history 37 Mita 3 ka 1 aircraft had been produced by the start of 1979.

It was intended to replace the numerous but ageing gliders equipping French gliding clubs; when Centrair ceased trading in 1988 some eighty Mariannes had been sold, fewer than hoped. Design and development French government support for gliding was generous immediately after World War II but was fading by the 1980s. The F√©d√©ration Fran√ßais de Vol √† Voile (FFVV), who administered the French gliding movement, had to become self-financing and were central players in an effort to retain a viable gliding manufacturing base in France. By that time there was a need for a new two seat training glider to replace the existing club fleet of some 270 Wassmer Bijaves, so a competition was launched and won by Centrair. The Marianne design gained financial support from the Ministry of Transport and design support from Dassault Aviation and the Office Nationale d'Etude de Recherche Aerospatiale (ONERA). The Marianne has a shoulder wing mounted with 3¬∞ of dihedral. It has a single spar formed from glassfibre rovings, around which the laminar flow wing profile and ailerons are made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foam and glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) sandwich. There are no flaps; double plate aluminium airbrakes extend only above the upper wing surface. The fuselage is a monocoque pod and boom structure also built with composite sandwich layers, but with carbon fibre added. Its T-tail is constructed from GRP; the tailplane carries an elevator. There is no provision for water ballast. The two tandem seats have a common upper line but two single piece canopies, the forward one forward hinged and the rear opening to starboard. The undercarriage is fixed, with a main monowheel, fitted with a hydraulic brake, placed at the pod-boom transition within a prominent fairing and assisted by a smaller nosewheel. The Marianne made its first flight on 19 September 1985 and received certification on 29 January 1987. There were plans for later versions: an advanced trainer with flaps and retractable undercarriage; a higher performance Marianne with longer span (20.9 m; 68 ft 7 in); and a motorized, self launching version. None of these seem to have been built before Centrair ceased trading after producing eighty Mariannes. Operational history The Marianne got mixed reviews at club level: its performance was good, perhaps somewhere between that of two of its best contemporaries, the Grob Twin Astir and the Schempp-Hirth Janus, the airbrakes worked well and its build quality and viceless handling were also praised. Criticism focussed on the rear seat, which was said to be uncomfortable with restricted views, and the difficult rigging and de-rigging procedures. Sixty- five Mariannes appeared on the civil aircraft registers of mainland Europe in 2010. The September 2012 UK register lists two more.

Similarly to all the earliest prelates in the newly baptized kingdom, he was a foreigner, most probably from Lombardy or France. He seems to have resigned from his office five years before his death. Life Most information on his life has been preserved in the Annales Posonienses and in a letter written by Bishop Fulbert of Chartres to him in the 1020s. Bonipert's correspondence with the Frankish prelate may reflect his French origin, but his namewhich was quite frequently mentioned in charters issued in Lombardy around 1000suggests an Italian parentage. A third source, a list of the bishops of P√©cs which had by now been lost stated that Bonipert had begun his career in Hungary as royal chaplain in the court of Stephen I, the first king of Hungary. Bonipert was appointed to the see of P√©cs in 1009 when the deed of foundation of the new diocese was issued in Gy≈ër in the presence of the papal legate, Azo. Accordingly, the organization of the bishopric must have begun under his auspices. However, only the establishment of a cathedral school at P√©cs is documented, since Bonipert's request for a work by Priscian from Bishop Fulbert of Chartres must have been connected to it. The Annales Posonienses relates that Bonipert's successor, Maurus became the bishop of P√©cs in 1036, but Bonipert only died in 1042. Therefore Bonipert seems to have resigned from the bishopric, most probably because of his age or health. However, neither can it be excluded that King Stephen forced him to renounce for unknown reasons.

It was dedicated in 1937 to the memory of Frank Melville Jr., father of local philanthropist Ward Melville. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 19, 2010. The 24 acre park contains a walking trail and is also home to the Three Village Garden Club Arboretum, which is maintained by a group of local volunteers. A series of mills have inhabited the Mill Pond as early as 1660. The current mill house was built with the help of Donald A. Spetta in 1937 and contains a running simulated mill wheel which continues this historical legacy. The mill house also services as the park headquarters. Another historic structure is the Satterly Barn which was built in the early 1700s. A stable was added around 1937 and the structure was re-sided and re- roofed in 1968 under the direction of Ward Melville. Nearby is the John Satterly House which is claimed to be one of the oldest houses in the Setauket area. It was completely restored in 1968 by Ward Melville. Another property owned by the park foundation is the Bates House, a 1922 Colonial Revival-style house that was acquired in 1955. The house is rented by the foundation year round for special events. Sitting adjacent to the park on the East side is the Patriot's Hollow State Forest. It is home to \\"Patriot's rock\\", which was once a meeting place of the Setalcott Indians and the site of Reverend Nathaniel Brewster's first sermon. During the Revolutionary war, it was the site of a skirmish with Tory forces garrisoned in the nearby Presbyterian church on August 24, 1772.

The film stars Terence Hill in the title role, which was previously played by Franco Nero in Sergio Corbucci's original film. Django, Prepare a Coffin is unique among the plethora of films which capitalized on Corbucci's in that it is not only a semi-official, legitimate follow-up, but was also originally intended to star Nero. A piece from the film's score, \\"Last Man Standing\\", was sampled in the song \\"Crazy\\" by American soul duo Gnarls Barkley.

Django pretends to be dead and starts working as a hangman, who spares the lives of the condemned victims of David Barry‚Äôs conspiracies. He organizes them in a band to ‚Äùhaunt‚Äù the perjurers that sent them to the gallows. This is part of a plan to disclose Barry and bring him to justice. The ‚Äùhanged‚Äù are supposed to intercept an attack on a gold transport and capture Barry‚Äôs men to get evidence, but Garcia - who earlier has saved Django‚Äôs life during a fight within the group - convinces the rest of the men that instead they should take the gold for themselves. Garcia then kills the others. Django saves Garcia‚Äôs wife from hanging, and she then saves Django after Barry has captured him. Garcia regrets his treachery, which he explains by the fact that he is poor, and helps Django lure Barry to the graveyard, where Django digs up his own coffin and then kills Barry and his gang with the machine gun kept in the coffin. Garcia dies in the fight. Django leaves a sack of gold to Garcia‚Äôs wife ‚Äùfor you and the children‚Äù before he leaves. Release Django, Prepare a Coffin was released on January 27, 1968. Reception In his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Fridlund suggests that though Django, Prepare a Coffin is basically a story of vindication and retribution, the relationship between Django and Garcia shows some affinity with the Gringo specialist/social bandit pair in \\"political\\" spaghetti westerns like The Mercenary.Fridlund, Bert: The Spaghetti Western.

He was born at Killegland, now Ashbourne, County Meath, son of Richard Segrave, Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) who was head of a prominent landowning family. Little is known of his mother. He married before 1589 Mary Dillon, daughter of Chief Justice Robert Dillon, who in the year 1589 sent him to London with gifts of hawks and horses for the Privy Council.Ball p.226 On his father's death in 1598 Patrick took his place as a Baron of the Exchequer. He was charged in 1602 with bribery and corruption, and stood trial before the Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber. The Delahide family's lands at Dunshaughlin, County Meath had been forfeited to the Crown for treason. Segrave was accused of conspiring with Richard Read and David Russell to procure a jury to find the title (i.e. award the title) in favour of Read, and of receiving a large bribe in return; he was also charged with attempting to bribe Sir Richard Cooke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland.Crawford p.286 Segrave was found guilty, removed from office, fined ¬£1000 and imprisoned at the pleasure of the Crown.Crawford p.286 His disgrace was not permanent; in 1607 he was admitted to the King's Inns and became a member of its governing council. He attended meetings of the council until 1610, after which his name disappears from the records. The Patrick Segrave of Killeglan whose estates were forfeited for his part in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 was probably his son or grandson.

During his early days of University he was attracted to the social justice movement and wanted to work for the poor and neglected section of people.

Shashi Bhusan Behera The political era in Odisha was going on for a major revamp, the beginning of Naveen after the super cyclone of Odisha can be seen.  Political career  Shashi from the very beginning of his university days was detrimental of working for the people not for the corporate boss or the executive boss. He wanted to work for the upliftment of peoples who were not regarded as the part of the main stream society. And it is because of his and Sj Akulananda Behera‚Äôs effort that the fisherman society was included in the Schedule Caste category of Odisha and that the poor and innocent peoples who never were regarded as part of the main stream society now started to be included. The non-corrupt and non-compromising ideology of Shashi‚Äôs stopped him from compromising and joining the power politics of state. But destiny was to play his role. With the death of the Legendary Biju Pattnaik and to fill the vacuum created Sj Naveen Patnaik came to Odisha whose thought ideology and working forced Shashi to rethink his decision and he meet Sj. Naveen Pattnaik in the year 2000, who at once like him and wanted him to contest from Balipatna Electoral Constituency. As destiny wanted something else, he could not contest the 2000 election. But Naveenji has set his mind, came the 2004 and Shashi was elected from Balianta & Balipatna Electoral Constituency on Biju Janata Dal Ticket. And he never disappointed Naveenji (the most loved and respected leader of Odisha). In 2005 he was selected by the Speaker among the Members of the State Legislative Assembly to be awarded the Prestigious Utkalmani Gopabandhu Samman for the Best Legislator in the assembly. The worked for the development of the peoples of Balianta and Balipatna, his non- corrupt and non-compromising inspired many, and he was engulfed in the development of his constituency. It was his effort and vision that the Balianta and Balipatna Constituency was named after ‚ÄòJaydev‚Äô the famous poet who Gita Govinda is recited before lord Jagannath every day. Came the year of 2009, he was confident of his work and effort and that the leader would surely re-elect him. But Naveen ji wanted his man in Delhi, he instructed Shashi to work for the party in the forthcoming election and Shashi with a heavy heart never denied Naveenji and always worked with dedication to serve his people and party. In the year 2010 Naveenji surprised Shashi with a ticket to the upper house of Parliament (the Rajya Sabha). And made him also the leader of Biju Janata Dal Parliamentary Party in Rajya Sabha.

A smaller church, located on Rua Catalana, was built originally in 1592‚Äì1595 by the Confraternity of the Incoronatella. This church was nearly destroyed by an explosion in the Castel Nuovo in 1638. It was rebuilt in 1638‚Äì1639, and retitled Santa Maria Incoronatella della Piet√† dei Turchini when it acquired a dome. The facade was completed in 1769‚Äì70 by Bartolomeo Vecchione. Description The interior hosts two paintings, including the Discovery of the True Cross by St Helena, by Luca Giordano in the third chapel to right, including a Deposition; a Holy Family (1617) by Battistello Caracciolo. The large chapel of the right transept has altarpieces by Giacomo Farelli, depicting the Birth and Death of the Virgin. It houses a Exposition of Dead Christ by Angels by Crescenzo Gamba. The ceiling canvases, painted by Marulli and Annella di Massimo, were removed in the past centuries.Luigi Catalani, La chiese di Napoli Volume 2, 1845, page 143 The confraternity, also known as the Congregation of ‚Äò‚ÄôBianchi dell'Oratorio‚Äô‚Äô referring to the white robes worn by members, was involved in the welfare of orphan children abandoned in the nearby church of Incoronatella in Rua Catalana. In time, needing more space they moved here to via Medina, founding an orphanage, this church, and the annexed conservatory (Conservatorio della Piet√† dei Turchini). The name derives from the turquoise tunic worn by the orphans, who were conserved here. The orphanage instructed the children in art, specially music and singing, and the Conservatory produced or was associated with masters of Italian music. Among its pupils were Scarlatti, Giovanni Paisiello, and Giovan Battista Pergolesi. While the orphanage no longer remains, the building is used for concerts, including by the foundation of Centro di Musica Antica Piet√† de' Turchini, which specializes in performing classical Neapolitan music, including works associated historically with the conservatory associated with this church and orphanage complex.

The Fedoruk Centre does not have a mandate to conduct research itself. Instead, it acts as a conduit to fund nuclear released research projects in Saskatchewan and to oversee the operation of nuclear facilities on the University campus such as the universities cyclotron facility. The Fedoruk Centre is involved in funding research in the nuclear medicine, materials science, nuclear energy systems including small reactor design, and environmental and social topics related to nuclear technology. On October 3, 2012 the name of the organization was changed from the Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation to the Sylvia Fedoruk Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation in honour of Sylvia Fedoruk who did pioneering work in the treatment of cancer using cobalt-60 radiation therapy in the 1950s. The centre builds on other nuclear and accelerator related facilities already on the university campus that include the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory, Canadian Light Source, SLOWPOKE reactor operated by the Saskatchewan Research Council, and the STOR-M tokamak. The centre received an initial $30 million (CDN) in funding to advance research, innovation and training in four areas: * Advance nuclear medicine and knowledge, * Develop better materials for widespread applications (energy, health, environment, manufacturing, etc.), * Improve safety and other engineering of nuclear energy systems, and * Managing the risks and benefits of nuclear technology for society and our environment. The Fedoruk Centre will be responsible for the operations of a $25 million cyclotron facility being installed in a renovated a building between the Canadian Light Source and the Western College of Veterinary Medicine to be completed in 2014. The 24 MeV cyclotron will produce radioisotopes for medical imaging research and clinical use, including the province's PET-CT scanners. When the centre was formed some controversy existed over the governance and independence of the organization with only two board members appointed by the university while the other members have strong ties to the nuclear industry. In fact, all members of the Fedoruk Centre's Board of Directors are appointed by the University of Saskatchewan's Board of Governors.

Early life Hansen was born in 1989 in Takapuna on Auckland's North Shore and is of Samoan descent. She grew up in Canterbury and played netball for the Canterbury Flames including trials at the national level. Her motivation for taking up track cycling during secondary school was to increase her fitness for netball. Career At her second national trials, she set new national records in sprint and 500 m, which qualified her for the 2007 UCI Juniors World Championships held in Aguascalientes, Mexico. This was her first international event and gained her a training place in World Cycling Centre in the French speaking part of Switzerland, to where she moved. Hansen moved back to New Zealand in the following year (2008) and moved to Invercargill to train at the Invercargill ILT Velodrome, then the base of the New Zealand cycling team. During her time there in the Southland city, she trained as an air traffic controller at Invercargill Airport. At the 2011 Oceania Cycling Championships, she gained titles in team sprint, keirin, and the 500 m event. This secured her a place at the 2012 Summer Olympics for the Keirin and the sprint. Her preparation was distracted by her best friend dying of cancer, and Hansen returned to New Zealand in July 2012 for the funeral. She came 12th in the sprint and 11th in the Keirin. She took 2013 off from competitive cycling and looked for another opportunity to keep herself fit. She took up boxing to train for a charity event in Christchurch. She competed in 'Fight for Christchurch 2013' in November, raising funds for the Ronald McDonald House South Island. The event itself raised in excess of $200,000 for selected charities. Hansen regained her motivation for track cycling and moved to Cambridge on 1 January 2015; the national team had relocated to the Avantidrome when it officially opened in April 2014. At the same time, she relocated to Hamilton Airport for work. She teamed up with Katie Schofield for the team sprint and came fourth at a World Cup meeting in Cali, Colombia, in January 2015. Hansen was competing with Schofield and Stephanie McKenzie for selection for the 2016 Rio Olympics when she came fifth in the individual sprint in March 2016 at the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in London, and this performance secured her place at her second Olympics. Hansen was confirmed by the New Zealand Olympic Committee as part of the first track cyclists chosen for Rio on 7 April 2016. The remainder of the team was confirmed in July, and that included Olivia Podmore who was the other half of the sprint team. Hansen and Podmore did not survive the qualification round in the team sprint. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Hansen won the silver medal in the individual sprint and bronze in the keirin, and was part of the New Zealand team (with Emma Cumming) that won silver in the team sprint.

Built in 1925 on Main Street, the train station served a short connector line that connected Bentonville to the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (Frisco) to the east in Rogers, and the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad to the west in Gravette. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1988. History =Railroads in Benton County= Alfred B. Greenwood put forth legislation in the United States House of Representatives in 1853 concerning right of way for a railroad between Springfield, Missouri and Bentonville, but railroads did not come to Arkansas until after the Civil War. In the 1870s, the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway was interested in extending their line south from Pierce City, Missouri through Bentonville and Fayetteville to Fort Smith to service the fertile orchards and tobacco fields of northwest Arkansas. The routing changed around 1880, and the Frisco instead ran through Avoca, Lowell, and Rogers before entering Fayetteville, missing Bentonville entirely. Bentonville businessmen built a short, spur line called the Bentonville Railroad in 1882 to connect to the Frisco in Rogers. Although this provided rail service to Bentonville, the Frisco charged high rates for usage of their line. The spur between Bentonville and Rogers became part of the Arkansas and Oklahoma Railroad in 1898 and was extended west to the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad in Gravette. The extension gave Bentonville citizens, businesspeople, and farmers an alternative to the Frisco. In 1899 the line was extended further west to Grove, Oklahoma. The Frisco purchased the line in 1900. These railroads gave Bentonville and western Benton County an opportunity to grow the apple industry that was emerging after the decline of tobacco in the area. This Bentonville Train Station replaced an inefficient structure on the same site in 1925. Following World War II, the train station ceased operations and became derelict. A group became interested in the station's rehabilitation in 1980 and leased the building to the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce upon restoration. Today The Bentonville Train Station now serves as the office for Celebrate Arkansas Magazine. Adjacent to the north is Train Station Park which offers a landscaped area around a gazebo and several benches. The park also gives access to the Downtown Trail. Across the street from the train station is the Bentonville Public Library, also listed on the NRHP.

It is located on a still-active segment of the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad used by freight trains running between New Britain and Waterbury. Although locally known as the Mile Long Tunnel, the Pequabuck Tunnel is just 3,580 feet long ‚Äì 0.68 miles. The tunnel is 32 feet wide and 26 feet tall, with regularly spaced recesses in the walls to allow a person to seek safety while a train passes. The tunnel is locally rumored to be haunted, with apocryphal reports of two ghostly figures. History The section of the Hartford, Providence & Fishkill between Hartford and Waterbury opened in July 1855. The route was twisty owing to the hilly terrain. Construction of the tunnel through Sylvan Hill in Plymouth began in 1906, but temporarily stopped in 1907 due to financial issues. Despite a cave-in in July 1908, the tunnel was completed in 1910. The first passenger train through the tunnel ran on January 27, 1911. The Pequabuck station (signed as Terryville) was located near the east portal of the tunnel. As passenger service began to decline, the second track was removed in 1939 and the remaining track was moved to the center of the tunnel a year later. Through service on the entire Hartford, Providence & Fishkill ended in the 1920s, but passenger service on the Hartford-Waterbury segment lasted until 1962. In the last years of service, the Pequabuck station was only open on Saturday mornings. Although passenger service no longer operates on the line, it is still used for freight service by Pan Am Southern. The possibility exists for the restoration of passenger service on the Hartford-Waterbury route, which would include the first regularly scheduled passenger trains through the tunnel in more than a half-century.

Today, Edenred offers solutions for employee benefits, loyalty programs, fleet and mobility and corporate payment. 44 million employees use Edenred services worldwide. History Inspired by the original Luncheon Voucher, a concept launched in the United Kingdom in 1954, Jacques Borel created Ticket Restaurant on the French market in 1962. A French government decree, passed in 1967, officially recognized the meal voucher as an employee benefit. The concept was launched outside France starting in 1976. Employee benefits continued to grow worldwide, first in Europe and then in Latin America, thanks to two programs: Ticket Restaurant and Ticket Alimentaci√≥n. The Ticket Restaurant¬Æ entity, which had been a subsidiary of the Accor Group since 1983, set itself a new course in 1998, when it became Accor Services. From the 2000s, the pace of growth increased, giving rise to \\"incentive and rewards\\" solutions, in Europe and Asia, in addition to Expense management, solutions, with the development of Ticket Car in Latin America. Following the split of Accor's hotel and prepaid services businesses, Accor Services became Edenred in June 2010. The new group became independent, defined its corporate mission project and was listed on NYSE Euronext Paris on July 2, 2010. Jacques Stern was appointed chairman and chief executive officer. The group sped up its transformation by making digital technology a pillar of its strategy and launched the Ticket Restaurant¬Æ card in France in April 2014. As of 2015, 78% of the group's business volume around the world was generated from digital solutions.

Early life Eric Esquivel was born in Gurnee, Illinois, of Irish and Mexican ancestry. Career Esquivel has worked as a journalist and critic, writing for such websites as Bleeding Cool, Fox News Latino, Bookmans Entertainment Exchange, and The Tucson Citizen. He has worked as a comics writer for publishers including Archie Comics, Boom Studios, DC Comics, Dynamite, Frederator Books, Heavy Metal, IDW, Papercutz, Scholastic, Starburns Industries Press, and Zenescope. In 2018, Esquivel began writing Border Town, a magic realist ongoing comics series with art by Ramon Villalobos, at the center of a relaunch of DC's Vertigo imprint. The series dealt with immigration and Latino identity, for which Esquivel received death threats in advance of its publication. The series was well-received by critics, and the first issue went to a second printing after its September 2018 release, to meet retailer demand. In December 2018, Esquivel was accused by a woman of subjecting her to ongoing sexual and emotional abuse several years previously; he disputed her account of their interaction. His creative collaborators on Border Town (of which four issues had been published) withdrew from the project. DC cancelled the unpublished issues, and accepted retailer returns of those that had been published. DC also cancelled plans for Esquivel to take over writing their superhero Nightwing series. In 2020, Esquivel announced Alternate Empire, a publishing venture with Eddie Berganza, who was terminated by DC in 2017 following sexual harassment allegations.

The majority of Kashubian emigrants settled in the United States; others emigrated to Canada and Brazil.Hanna Popowska-Taborska, Kaszubszczyzna: zarys dziej√≥w (Warszawa, 1980), p. 21. An online genealogical project, \\"The Great Kashubian Migration,\\" is devoted to tracking their settlement patterns. Their reasons for emigration varied. Until the Franco-Prussian War, Kashubians emigrated primarily for economic reasons. After the Franco-Prussian War and especially due to the Kulturkampf, Kashubian emigration accelerated as socio- political factors came into play. In his 1899 book, Statystyka ludnosci kaszubskiej (Statistics of the Kashubian Population), the Kashubophile linguist and sociologist Stefan Ramult estimated that 130,700 Kashubians were living in the Americas. Reasons for emigration The primary reason for emigration was economic. Kashubian farmers were not targeted by Prussian laws immediately after 1850. As the eminent Kashubian scholar, Professor J√≥zef Borzyszkowski of Gda≈Ñsk University has observed, Kashubs were more or less comfortable with Prussian governance at the time.Jozef Borszyskowski, The Kashubs, Pomerania and Gda≈Ñsk (English translation), p. 62. Rather, smallholders of all ethnicities were disadvantaged because the greater part of arable Pomeranian land already belonged to estate owners, and what remained was not particularly fertile. Another problem was the population boom among the Kashubs and Poles. Large families were typical of devout Roman Catholics, and in this particular case children were welcomed as additional workers. Once grown to maturity, however, the surfeit of young people were a further drain upon Pomerania's already strained fortunes. Recognizing this situation, the Prussian government tried to free up land by encouraging (but not forcing) Kashubs and Poles to emigrate. One very early incentive was inexpensive or even free travel to North America.Jan L. Perkowski, \\"The Kashubs: Origins and Emigration to the U.S.,\\" Polish American Studies, 23.1 (1966), p. 5. In the wake of the Franco-Prussian War and the unification of Germany, Kashubs and Poles met with institutionalized hostility. The Kulturkampf brought further indignities. It became illegal to use the Polish (and by default, the Kashubian) languages in public, including (or especially) church. By this time, too, the first wave of Kashubian emigrants had formed viable communities in towns such as Wilno (Ontario), Winona (Minnesota), Cedar (Michigan) and Stevens Point and Pine Creek (Wisconsin). Letters and remittances flowed from the contented North American immigrants, encouraging more Kashubs to try their chances in the West. One particular selling point was the availability of homesteads. Many emigrated; more, in fact, than the Kashubian immigrant communities could effectively absorb. As the Kashubian community within Germany became more self-aware (thanks to figures such as Florian Ceynowa and Aleksander Majkowski) it became more resilient in contending with the Germans; another result of the Kulturkampf was that Kashubs were more likely to make common cause with Poles.Cassubians The primary sources of the twentieth- century Polish emigration boom were the Austrian and Russian zones of occupation. First wave (1855-1870) Beginning around 1855, the Kashubian diaspora predated by at least 10 years the onset of the Polish American diaspora, which is typically dated to between 1865 and 1870. The first wave of Kashubian emigrants tended to sail from Hamburg to either New York City or Quebec. They emigrated in extended family groups that replicated themselves in North America. Portage County, Wisconsin's first Kashubian settlers, the Koziczkowski family, arrived in the fall of 1857.http://www.pchswi.org/archives/polish_heritage/1st_farmers.htm Renfrew County, Ontario's first Polish-Kashubian settlers are said to have arrived in 1858. The families that settled in Portage County and in Renfrew County quickly established farming settlements: Polonia, Wisconsin and Wilno, Ontario. Winona, Minnesota's first Kashubian settlers, the J√≥zef Bronk family, are believed to have reached that community in 1859. The group of emigrants that came to Winona had trouble finding farmland in the immediate vicinity; consequently in 1862 the satellite hamlet of Pine Creek was founded about 10 miles away, across the Mississippi River in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin. The two communities remain closely tied to this day, leading to Winona's status as the \\"Kashubian capital of America.\\" Second wave (1870-1900) The pace of Kashubian emigration picked up as the Kulturkampf gathered force. 1872 saw the founding of a small Kashubian community on Jones Island in Milwaukee's harbor by Kashubian immigrant Jacob Muza. Unfortunately, the harbor land was too valuable and the Kashubs had never acquired title: the last Kashub settler was forced out in 1944. Sarah Biondich, \\"Squatting on Jones Island,\\" ExpressMilwaukee.com, 24 June 2009 In the middle 1880s, a Kashubian enclave formed in the Chicago neighborhood of Lincoln Park, and the parish of Saint Josaphat was established there in 1884. In 1902, a huge new Romanesque church was completed there. In Winona, the Kashubian community attained such a size that in 1894 the Roman Catholic parish of Saint Stanislaus Kostka had to level its old sanctuary and build a new one seating 1800 worshipers. Since jobs in Winona's dwindling sawmill industry were in short supply, many of the newer immigrants proceeded west to newer Kashubian settlements in eastern South Dakota, western Minnesota and eastern North Dakota. Toward the turn of the century, minor Kashubian settlements were established in western North Dakota and eastern Montana. Location of Kashubs in the Americas, 1899 Ramult's chapter on Kashubians in the United States was contributed by Hieronim Derdowski, the Kashubian poet and editor of the Polish-American newspaper Wiarus, who broke down America's population of 90,700 Kashubians state by state: * New York - 7,000 Kashubs, in Buffalo * Michigan - 5,000 Kashubs, in Detroit * Minnesota - 6,000 Kashubs, in Winona and some small settlements * Illinois - 30.000 Kashubs, in Chicago * South Dakota - 500 Kashubs, in some small settlements * Massachusetts - 200 Kashubs, in Webster * Missouri - 1,000 Kashubs, in Saint Louis * Wisconsin - 30,000 Kashubs, in Milwaukee (20,000) and Portage County (10,000) * Other states - 10,000 Kashubs living in Pittsburgh, PA and Baltimore, MD The Kashubian community of Canada is centered in Renfrew County, Ontario and often meets at the Wilno Heritage Society's park for an annual festival. Brazil's Kashubian population, which Ramult estimated at 15,000, is mostly located in the state of Parana.

Nord Historic District, formerly Mont Nord Addition) is a historic district in Fayetteville, Arkansas encompassing one city block with five properties. The district lies atop a rise of about above the surrounding area. The properties were built between 1901 and 1925 in various architectural styles, and the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Fayetteville began booming after the Civil War with the establishment of the Arkansas Industrial University in 1871 and completion of the St. Louis - San Francisco Railway (Frisco) to the city. The railway also helped the growing apple and strawberry industries surrounding Fayetteville and began the growth of a timber industry.Silva 2011, p. 60. As a result, Fayetteville began to expand outward, including the Mont Nord Addition. The addition was platted in 1908 as the area bounded by Lafayette Street, Maple Street, Forest Avenue, and Mock Avenue. The name \\"Mont Nord\\" was taken from French to mean \\"North Mountain\\", as the addition was at the northern boundary of Fayetteville at the time.Silva 2011, p. 61. The district formerly included the Arkansas Building, a structure built in St. Louis Missouri for the 1904 World's Fair.

He was referred to as the \\"Master Spirit\\" of the insurrection, and was only passed over as overall leader in favor of Daniel Shays due to the perception of overzealousness on his part, by his men. As a lieutenant, and then a captain, he served for eight years and participated in many key battles of the American Revolutionary War, including the Siege of Boston, Quebec Expedition, Battles of Saratoga, Cherry Valley massacre, Sullivan Expedition and Siege of Yorktown. After the war, he joined the prestigious Society of the Cincinnati, which included the likes of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton.  Early life  Luke Day Jr. was born in 1743, in what is now West Springfield, Massachusetts, the oldest son of Luke Day, Sr. and Jerusha (Skinner) Day.\\"Massachusetts, Springfield Vital Records, 1638‚Äì1887,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XPJJ-W1M : accessed March 7, 2014), Luke Day, 1743.

On August 20, 1762, he announced his intention of marriage to Lydia Kelsey, originally of Killingworth Township, Connecticut, then of Westfield, Massachusetts, daughter of Stephen Kelsey, Jr. and Lydia (Noble) Kelsey, and they married soon after.\\"Massachusetts, Springfield Vital Records, 1638‚Äì1887,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XPNN-7ZN : accessed March 7, 2014), Luke Day and Lydia Kelsey, 1762. The Days and Kelseys had ties going back at least to the founding of Hartford, CT, where Robert Day and William Kelsey were neighbors. Luke and Lydia had ten children, although only five, four sons and a daughter, survived to adulthood. Luke was referred to as a Gentleman, and was well-educated. He was deeply religious and sought counsel from both his minister and the Bible itself for the grievances of the people. In particular, he was inspired by this Bible passage:  Family  The Days were one of the most prominent families in West Springfield, holding many positions in the local and state government. His father's cousin, Colonel Benjamin Day was called \\"the most prominent man on the west side of the river.\\" In addition to having a successful military career, Benjamin served many terms as a representative to the General Court of Massachusetts, and was the first moderator and one of the original selectmen of West Springfield. Benjamin also raised ninety pounds for the purchase of arms to be used in the Revolutionary War. Another of his father's cousins, William Day, was a sea captain and a hero of the French and Indian War for capturing a French admiral, and was the subject of a painting by John Singleton Copley. William was a member of the committee that approved the Sheffield Declaration.James M. Banner, Jr. \\"Sedgwick, Theodore\\"; American National Biography Online, February 2000. This William Day is a potential candidate to be the Captain William Day who earned Revolutionary War fame as the first American sea captain to be recognized by a foreign government (France). Luke's cousin Josiah owned a home, which still stands today as the oldest known brick saltbox-style house in the country, and serves as a family museum. Luke is known to have trained his men in the commons area in front of this house, and it may have even served as his headquarters. Luke's brother-in-law (and first cousin) was Justin Morgan, who developed the Morgan horse breed and composed music, which survives today. Luke's brother, Thomas, also served in the Revolution as a lieutenant.  Revolutionary War  Day, then a second lieutenant in Captain Enoch Chapin's company of minutemen, marched on Boston on April 20, 1775, in response to the Lexington Alarm of the previous day. He served in Danielson's Regiment for the remainder of 1775 during the Siege of Boston. On January 1, 1777 he was commissioned a captain in the 7th Massachusetts Regiment and served until his discharge on June 20, 1783. He was an original member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati.  Aftermath   Shays' Rebellion   Later years  The Society of the Cincinnati, which he had joined to solidify his legacy, dismissed him as a member on July 13, 1787, due to his involvement in Shays' Rebellion. When Luke Sr. died in 1791, Luke Jr. was not named in his will. It is not known whether this was due to his participation in the rebellion, or other factors. He was brought to court several times for unpaid mortgage debts. Luke was known to have suffered from gout in his later years, and lived out his life in relative poverty and obscurity.Swift, West Springfield Massachusetts: A Town History, p.40.  Death  On June 1, 1801, shortly before his 58th birthday, Luke died at his home in West Springfield.\\"Massachusetts, Deaths and Burials, 1795‚Äì1910,\\" index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/FCMW-R4H : accessed March 7, 2014), Luke Day, June 1, 1801. Due to his infamy at the time as a leader of Shays' Rebellion, he was buried next to his mother in an unmarked grave at Paucatuck Cemetery to prevent desecration, and only received a headstone almost two centuries later, in 1987, via the Ramapogue Historical Society.

Financed as the Mayflower was by Thomas Weston and others of the London-based Merchant Adventurers, Fortune was to transport thirty-five settlers to the colony on a ship that was much smaller than Mayflower. The Fortune required two months to prepare for the voyage and once underway, reached Cape Cod on 9 November 1621 and the colony itself in late November. The ship was unexpected by those in Plymouth colony and although it brought useful settlers, many of whom were young men, it brought no supplies, further straining the limited food resources of the colony. The ship only stayed in the colony about three weeks, returning to England in December loaded with valuable furs and other goods. But when nearing England, instead of heading to the English Channel, a navigation error caused the ship to sail south-east to the coast of France, where it was overtaken and seized by a French warship. The Fortune finally arrived back in London in February 1622, over two months after leaving Plymouth, but without its valuable cargo. In the end, Weston lost his total investment in the Fortune voyage making it worthwhile only in providing Plymouth colony with new settlers, some of whom became notable persons in the history of the colony.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 103Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006) pp. 123-125, 135Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History (New York: Knopf 2010), pp. 291, 292  Preparing for the voyage  At 55 tons displacement, and about one-third the tonnage of the Mayflower, the Fortune was tasked with delivering thirty-five new settlers to Plymouth Colony. Their leader was Robert Cushman who, in 1620, had been the Leiden agent in London for the Mayflower and Speedwell. It is believed that the majority of the passengers of the Fortune were gathered together in London by Thomas Weston and his partner. And although William Bradford stated that there were thirty-five persons on board Fortune, the names of only twenty- eight persons are noted as receiving lots credited to those arriving as noted in the 1623 Division of Land. Eighteen persons are known to have been unmarried, eight married, but emigrating without their families, and as far as can be determined, Mrs. Martha Ford may have been the only woman on the ship. Although it is possible some of the missing seven persons in the passenger count were wives, Bradford does not leave that impression in his account. Per author Charles Banks, individual records show that sixteen of the passengers can definitely be assigned to London or districts of the city such as Stepney and Southwark. Another three passengers were from Leiden in Holland. Ten more passengers, whose origins cannot be determined, either died early or left the colony as determined by who was listed in the 1627 Division of Cattle, which also doubled as a type of census.Charles Edwards Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 104Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and Their New World: A History (New York: Knopf 2010), p. 291  Fortune arrival in the New World  Although the Fortune arrived in the Cape Cod area on 9 November 1621, the ship strangely remained at the tip of the Cape for some time which caused the natives to be alarmed, thinking it might be a hostile French vessel. Upon hearing reports of this strange vessel, Governor Bradford had Myles Standish arm his militia and load the cannon on Burial Hill in case of an attack by the French. It took the ship several weeks to find Plymouth and when the Fortune at last finally entered Plymouth Bay, she was seen to be a friendly English ship and the settlers were delighted and much relieved. But during the transit from Cape Cod to Plymouth the passengers were shocked by the barren and bleak shoreline, much as the Mayflower passengers had been. The Fortune passengers found it hard to believe that anything could exist in such a forbidding land. Per Bradford, \\"..and ther saw nothing but a naked and barren place..\\" And when they saw the depressing conditions within the colony being experienced by the settlers, they became quite panicked. The passengers were so disheartened and had such misgivings about this place they even advised the ship‚Äôs master they wanted to reembark and leave if the colony did not meet their expectations, but were talked out of such action by the master and ship‚Äôs crew although they were promised that if need be, they would be taken down the coast to Virginia. The primary reason for problems at their arrival was the unexpected nature of it and severe lack of food. As Bradford recorded, \\"..So they were landed; but there was not as much as biscuit-cake or any other victialls for them neither had they any beding, but some sorry things they had in their cabins, nor pot, nor pan, to dress meate in; nor over many cloathes,‚Ä¶\\" The colony government was not pleased that Weston had unexpectedly sent over new settlers, and without provisions or other goods to support them. But the labor that had come on the Fortune was welcome, being many young men. Per Bradford, the arrivals were \\"lusty young men, and many of them wild enough.\\"Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006) pp. 124-125Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 22  Fortune passengers  Contrary to conditions on the Mayflower one year earlier, everyone on the Fortune seemed to be in good health upon arrival. One birth was recorded soon after arrival ‚Äì Martha Ford gave birth to a son, although her husband William Ford may have died about that time as well as the son. On the ship were a large number of non-religious passengers having been given the sobriquet of \\"Strangers,\\" many of them single men who would greatly out-number the single, marriageable females in the colony. With arrival of the Fortune the colony had a total of sixty-six men and just sixteen women. This situation regarding the shortage of women may have come about partly as a result of the many deaths in the winter of 1621/22. For every eligible female, there were six eligible men. Another problem that concerned the Fortune arrivals was that there were no accommodations for them in the little colony. Bradford was forced to divide the Fortune passengers among the preexisting seven houses and four public buildings, some of which were converted into virtual male dormitories for the many young men. The problem that most concerned the colony was the continuing shortage of food made more severe by the arrival of the Fortune. Weston had not provided any provisions for the settlement on board the Fortune. And instead of making the colony situation stronger, the arrival of thirty-seven more persons to feed with the second severe winter for the colony coming on had put things in what would be a disastrous situation. Bradford calculated that even if their daily rations were reduced to half, their store of corn would only last for six more months. And after having worked tirelessly this year and experiencing extreme hardships since their arrival one year earlier, they now would face another hard winter with a shortage of provisions. Bradford wrote, \\"They were presently put to half allowance, one as well as an other, which begane to be hard, but they bore it patiently, under hope of (future) supply.\\"Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006) pp. 124‚Äì126.  Robert Cushman and the Merchant Adventurers  One of the leading passengers on board the Fortune was Robert Cushman, accompanied by his son Thomas. Thomas in later life would become the church Elder for the Colony. Robert Cushman had been the London agent for Leiden and in 1620 was involved in Mayflower and Speedwell voyage preparations. In 1620 Cushman had negotiated a Mayflower (financial support) contract with the Merchant Adventurers that Bradford and others of the Leiden contingent refused to approve at Southampton with the Leideners saying the contract was all in the Adventurers favor and to the settlers detriment. Cushman‚Äôs purpose of coming to Plymouth was to convince the Plymouth settlers to finally approve this agreement that had been unsigned for over a year. Governor Bradford knew that, so far, the Adventurers had nothing to show for their investment, and after assurance from Cushman that Weston could be counted on to be trusted, Bradford and the others signed the agreement that Cushman had brought from the Merchant Adventurers.  Loading for the return trip to England  To prove to the Adventurers that they were serious about repaying the debt owed to Weston, the colony spent two weeks in December 1621 loading the Fortune with hogsheads of beaver skins, otter skins, sassafras, and clapboards made from split oak to be used in the making of barrel staves. The value of the cargo was about 400-500 pounds, which would come close to reducing the colony‚Äôs debt to the Adventurers by half.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006) pp. 125-126  Fortune return voyage to England  The Fortune stayed in Plymouth for just about two weeks, and on 13 December 1621, she got underway for her return voyage to London. On board was Robert Cushman who had left his fourteen-year-old son Thomas in the care of Governor Bradford. Cushman carried, in addition to Bradford‚Äôs letter to Weston, a manuscript that would be become an invaluable historic recording of the Pilgrims first thirteen months in America known today as Mourt‚Äôs Relation. Believed written by Bradford and Edward Winslow, it recounts the First Thanksgiving and the abundance of the New World.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006) p. 126 Fortune was not with the ship of that name on the return to England. Apparently due to a major navigation error, navigation being imperfect in those days, the ship sailed hundreds of miles off course from England, south-east into France‚Äôs Bay of Biscay off the coast of Vendee, north of La Rochelle. About five weeks into her voyage on 19 January 1622 and not far from the fortified Ile d‚ÄôYeu, a French warship overtook the Fortune which was off-course about 350 sea miles southeast of where they should be ‚Äì England‚Äôs Land‚Äôs End and the English Channel. It seems the Fortune made a common mistake ‚Äì her master mistook the long peninsula of Brittany in western France for the Lizard Peninsula on the southwestern end of England and then she strayed off down the French Atlantic coast to be taken by a French warship. And although the Fortune was not considered an enemy ship, France at this time was undergoing Huguenot rebel activities and any English vessel coming close to their shore was suspected of aiding the rebels and liable for search and seizure. The French warship stopped and boarded Fortune and she was seized. And although it was soon learned that Fortune was not carrying contraband, the French governor seized her guns, cargo and rigging. The governor locked the ship‚Äôs master in a dungeon and kept Cushman and the crew on board under guard. He also confiscated the manuscript of Mort‚Äôs Relation. After thirteen days they were freed, with the manuscript in Cushman‚Äôs possession but without its cargo of valuable beaver skins. The Fortune finally arrived back into the Thames on 17 February 1622.Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History (New York: Knopf 2010), pp. 307-308 The loss of Fortunes valuable cargo dealt a severe financial loss to the Merchant Adventurers who by this time had little hope of recouping their investment in either ship. Due to this, the Merchant Adventurers were reorganized in 1626 in conjunction with Plymouth Colony leaders, in an effort to restructure financial agreements and for Plymouth Colony to eventually pay its creditors. Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 27, 32, 36Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History (New York: Knopf 2010), p 308  Other ships visit Plymouth 1622‚Äì1624  And although English ships bringing new colony settlers did not come out until the Anne and Little James arrived in the summer of 1623, Plymouth Colony was not entirely isolated. English fishing boats and some ships financed by colonization ventures did call at the colony from time to time. Edward Winslow recorded that in June or July 1622 two ships, the Charitie and Swan, financed by Thomas Weston, came into Plymouth Harbor. The ships carried about fifty or sixty colonists scheduled to settle in areas outside Plymouth. About this time the Sparrow and a shallop were also involved in colonization efforts. And the ship Discovery, in a 1622 voyage from Virginia to England, made a short visit at Plymouth with a letter by passenger John Pory, an official of Jamestown, written in praise of the colony. In October 1622 the ship Paragon, with sixty-seven passengers, came out by \\"private men's purses\\" but had to return to England two weeks later, leaking from storm damage. The Paragon made another attempt to reach Plymouth in February 1623 but apparently was driven back by North Atlantic weather and never did reach Plymouth. As the years went by, more English fishing boats came out to the New England coast. In 1624 Capt. John Smith reported, \\"There hath been a fishing this yeere upon the Coast about 50 English ships‚Ä¶\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691.

Recorded from May to August 2012, it exhibited what the group described as a darker, more minimal style, and was leaked by Death Grips themselves due to complications over its release date with their label Epic Records, who subsequently dropped them; the album was later made available for purchase via the band's own Third Worlds imprint and Harvest Records. The album's release was met with strong attention from online media groups largely due to its sexually explicit album cover, which features a picture of group member Zach Hill's erect penis with the title written across it. Despite this, the album received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its complexity and stripped-down sound. Production =Background and recording= The album was first announced in early 2012 along with the release of two tracks from their album The Money Store, and was originally titled No Love. A sticker was included in the physical release of The Money Store that read: \\"No Love. Fall 2012.\\" on the reverse side. On April 4, 2012, Death Grips announced dates for an international supporting tour for The Money Store, later adding more to the list. However, shortly after the release of The Money Store, the group cancelled the entire tour so that they could finish the recording of No Love. Recording of the album took place from May to August 31, 2012 at MC Ride and Zach Hill's apartment in Sacramento, California. On August 12, 2012, Death Grips announced through Pitchfork that the title of the album had been changed to No Love Deep Web and that they had recorded 20 tracks for the album and were narrowing it down to 13 tracks. =Style= In an interview with Exclaim! the group said that: \\"No Love [is a] sort of a culmination of our two previous releases. We think it'll end up being the heaviest thing we've made so far on many levels. It's striking us as the closest we've gotten to what our initial vision of what Death Grips would sound like. We have the feeling and it's pretty absolute that this album will contain our most future-forward and potent material...It's emotionally raw and direct; the sound is indescribable, it's very beat oriented. It has some of the guitar-driven elements that we touched on with Exmilitary but they aren't exactly being generated by a guitar.\\" In August 2012 the band told Pitchfork: \\"there are no manually programmed drums on this album, the beats are being played live on a Roland electronic v-drum set or acoustic drum set by Zach. There are no features, guest collabs or outside producers. The material is cold, bass heavy, minimal, rock & roll influenced and could simultaneously fit into a rave or dance club context. It is essentially rap and electronic music while at times extremely aggressive.\\" The song 'Artificial Death In The West' features an audio sample from the song 'Being Sucked In Again' by English post-punk band Wire from their 1978 album Chairs Missing. Promotion To promote No Love Deep Web the group created an alternate reality game (ARG) which ran from August 12‚Äì16, 2012, beginning minutes after their release of a statement about the album through Pitchfork Media. Using the internet as its medium, it mainly employed encrypted archive files hosted on the Tor Network with the filetype .gpg. The game employed many types of encryption through image, text and sound files, including Braille, QR code, Base64, the Caesar cipher, Binary code, Morse code and the Affine cipher, and used websites such as Imgur and various TOR related sites. The game yielded the first mention of the original release date of No Love Deep Web, October 23, 2012, and an unmastered version of The Money Store for download on the first day. On the fifth day an instrumental version of The Money Store was discovered by users of 4chan on a .onion domain and uploaded for regular download. Throughout August the group announced plans for live shows, including a gig at Electric Ballroom, London, and participation in festivals such as the Pitchfork Music Fest Paris and the Big Day Out. Release On September 30, 2012, Death Grips announced through their Facebook and Twitter accounts that their record label refused to release the album until \\"next year sometime\\" instead of the intended date of October 23, 2012. They then released the track listing and told fans to stay tuned for midnight on October 1. On the next day the band self-released the album through a website posted via Twitter as well as SoundCloud, and various filesharing services including BitTorrent. Later that day, it was revealed that Death Grips topped BitTorrent's \\"List of Most Legally Downloaded Music\\" following the release of No Love Deep Web, with 34,151,432 downloads. Upon its release, No Love Deep Web was met with a swarm of media attention. Several hours after its release, the group's official website was shut down. In an interview, Zach Hill claimed that their record label, Epic, shut it down; however, Epic denied any involvement. The website reappeared shortly after. On October 31, 2012, Death Grips posted confidential emails they received from Epic concerning their copyright infringement on Facebook. The emails, dated October 1, 2012, revealed that Epic planned to receive the original album masters from the group and release the album in stores, but following the leak of the letters, Epic announced that they worked to end their relationship with Death Grips. On November 19, 2013, No Love Deep Web was released on vinyl and CD through Harvest Records, as well as being made available on iTunes and Spotify.http://open.spotify.com/album/7GyAtRp4zEs3zTT2M27ZdK Artwork and controversy No Love Deep Web was met with controversy related to its album cover, which depicts the image of an erect penis with the album title written across it. The picture was taken in a bathroom at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, which is where the band stayed for the 2 months leading up to the leak.https://www.spin.com/2012/11/death-grips-artist-year-2012-no-love-deep- web/?page=3 In an interview with Spin Magazine, Ride responded to the interest by saying, \\"If you look at that and all you see is a dick, I don't really have anything to say, pretty much. I looked at it and said, 'This is a great photo, and I'd love for this to be the album cover.'\\" Hill further explained, \\"It was difficult to do, honestly, in general, it was very difficult. It's difficult even telling people that's the source of it; it feels sacrificial in a sense. That idea existed long before, by the way. This is going to sound funny to other people, but we saw it as tribal, as spiritual, as primal. Also, it comes from a place of being a band that is perceived as...such an aggressive, male- based, by some, misogynistic-seeming band... It's a display of embracing homosexuality, not that either of us are homosexual. Am I making sense? People are still going to think that it's macho, but that's not the source of where it comes from.\\" In a separate interview with Pitchfork, Hill expounded, \\"It's also a spiritual thing; it's fearlessness...it represents pushing past everything that makes people slaves without even knowing it.\\"https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9004-death-gripz/ Due to the explicit album artwork, Death Grips were forced to place a disclaimer on their website warning of the explicit content. The statement from the group said \\"U.S law states you must be 18 years of age to view graphic sexual material. We consider this art.\\" A censored version, replacing the penis with a black bar, was released through their YouTube and SoundCloud channels. Several days after the album's initial release, the group released alternate artwork containing an image of a person wearing tube socks with the words \\"SUCK MY DICK\\" printed across the ankle of them. The 2013 Harvest release features the original artwork packaged in a black slipcase with a disclaimer stating that the artwork is explicit. The slipcase has to be removed before the album cover is shown. Reception No Love Deep Web was met with positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, which indicates \\"generally favorable\\", based on 13 reviews. Grayson Currin, of Pitchfork, gave the album a positive review, stating \\"loud and punishing, the sonics of No Love Deep Web suit MC Ride's mix of hysteria, rage and exhaustion.\\" John Doran, of BBC Music, also commended the album; while saying that \\"the record is certainly denser and more difficult to find an entry point into than either of its predecessors,\\" Doran stated \\"after several listens a handful of stone- cold, diamond-hard gems present themselves from a scree of electronic beats and stentorian rapping/shouting.\\" He also compared the band's sound to that of Autechre. In a mixed review of the album, Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said \\"Even at a meaty 46 minutes, the album still suffers from a feeling of writer's block.\\" Track listing Charts {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - !Chart (2012) !Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Heatseeker Albums  7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Rap Albums  22 - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Tastemaker Albums  16 } References External links * Category:2012 albums Category:Obscenity controversies in music Category:Epic Records albums Category:Death Grips albums Category:Albums free for download by copyright owner ","title":"No Love Deep Web"},{"id":"36706595","text":"Mike Lafferty may refer to: * Mike Lafferty (motorcyclist) (born 1975), American Enduro racer * Mike Lafferty (alpine skier) (born 1948), American former alpine skier ","title":"Mike Lafferty"},{"id":"36706600","text":"Eileen Beasley (4 April 1921 ‚Äì 12 August 2012) was a Welsh teacher who, along with her husband Trefor, conducted a campaign of civil disobedience in the 1950s against the Rural District Council of Llanelly in a demand for council rate bills in the Welsh language. Her stand has led Welsh language campaigners to describe her as the \\"mother of direct action\\" and her protest helped to lead to the creation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg. Early life Catherine Eileen James was born in 1921. She was one of two children, she being the younger. She attended University College Cardiff and became a teacher. She met Trefor Beasley at Plaid Cymru gatherings and they were married on 31 July 1951. The couple moved to Llangennech near Llanelli in 1952. Welsh language campaign Eileen and her husband Trefor became leading campaigners in the right to use Welsh in the 1950s, as at that time the Welsh language had no official status in Wales: no forms by public bodies were issued in the Welsh language and there were few bilingual road signs. The Beasleys refused to pay their tax bills until they were written in Welsh, as at the time they were written only in English. This refusal led to the couple being taken to court 16 times over the course of eight years, along with many personal belongings being taken by bailiffs. Trefor spent a week in prison. After numerous court appearances the couple won their battle in 1960, at which point Llanelli district council agreed to print tax bills bilingually in Welsh and English Both Eileen and Trefor were elected as local councillors in 1955 for Plaid Cymru on Llanelli district council. Eileen Beasley is known as the \\"mother of direct action\\" in Wales and the \\"Rosa Parks of Wales\\". In April 2015 Llanelli Community Heritage unveiled a commemorative Blue Plaque at the Beasley Family home in Llangennech. Creation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg In 1962 Saunders Lewis a prominent Welsh nationalist and a founder of Plaid Cymru, gave a radio speech entitled Tynged yr iaith (The Fate of the Language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. This speech led to the creation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the Welsh Language Society). During this speech he directly praised the actions of Trefor and Eileen Beasley for their campaign for Welsh language tax bills. Lewis took the Beasley case as a model for future action, but significantly added \\"this cannot be done reasonably except in those districts where Welsh- speakers are a substantial proportion of the population\\". He proposed to make it impossible for the business of local and central government to continue without using Welsh\\". \\"It is a policy for a movement\\", he said, \\"in the areas where Welsh is a spoken language in daily use\\" it would be \\"nothing less than a revolution\\".

Creation, premi√®re, original title  According to the composer, the catalyst for the work‚Äôs creation was a rare indoor concert by the Goldman Band in Carnegie Hall: > When Edwin Franko Goldman arrived at his seventieth birthday it was > celebrated by a concert sponsored by the League of Composers. For the > concert they engaged the Goldman Band of New York and asked Dr. Goldman to > conduct his own band in honor of his own anniversary. [My wife] Louise and I > went to that [3 January 1948] concert and I suddenly thought of all the > beautiful sounds the American concert band could make that it hadn‚Äôt yet > made. That doesn‚Äôt mean that the unmade sounds passed in review in my mind > at all, but the sounds they made were so new to me after all my years with > orchestra, dance bands and tiny ‚Äúcombos‚Äù that my pen was practically jumping > out of my pocket begging me to give this great big instrument some more > music to play. To satisfy this urging I found time to put a good-sized piece > on paper. There was really no such thing as spare time for me at that time, > but somehow I got a part done here and a part done there and one day there > was this piece to show Dr. Edwin Franko Goldman to see if he was interested > in adding one more idiom to his great collection. Dr. Goldman and his son > Richard, also a doctor, became very warm friends indeed and gave the new > piece a great send-off. It was published with the name Suite of Old American > Dances. I had a nice name for it, but you know how publishers are‚Äîthey know > their customers, and we authors never seem to. My name for it was Electric > Park. Electric Park in Kansas City was a place of magic to us kids. The > tricks with big electric signs, the illuminated fountains, the big band > concerts, the scenic railway and the big dance hall‚Äîall magic. In the dance > hall all afternoon and evening you could hear the pieces the crowds danced > to, and the five movements of my piece were samples of the dances of the > day.‚ÄùBennett, Robert Russell.

In consultation with Bennett, Fennell authored an extensive 1979 article about the piece, aimed at conductors, for The Instrumentalist magazine. In that article, he described the circumstances of the work's creation in 1948-49, while Bennett was occupied with orchestrations for such Broadway musicals as Inside U.S.A., Sally, Heaven on Earth, Kiss Me, Kate, All for Love, and South Pacific:http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=11369 > ‚ÄúNo full score was ever written by Bennett and none [as of 1979] is > currently available from the publishers.

As with Suite of Old American Dances eight years later, its various movements reflect the characteristic dances of his young years (including a Turkey Trot, Rag, One-Step, Waltz Clog, and Cake Walk); it is the ‚ÄúOne-Step‚Äù movement that was developed and expanded into Suite's ‚ÄúWestern One-Step‚Äù movement.Ferencz, George J. ‚ÄúRobert Russell Bennett, Composer and Arranger.‚Äù Wind Band Teaching Symposium, U. of Missouri-Kansas City, 22 June 2011.

The twelfth episode of the series is written by John Shiban, and directed by Adam Davidson. In the episode, Thomas Durant (Colm Meaney) takes some men to a ransacked town of his namesake, where he learns the Sioux Nation has declared war on him. Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) is freed from the Union Army prison by an unlikely ally. Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) promises Eva (Robin McLeavy) justice in the prostitute's murder, which Elam (Common) investigates. Plot A band of Indian braves ransack Durant, Nebraska and set it on fire, while Eva hides and watches. At the Fort Larned jailhouse, Cullen is told he is guilty of armed robbery and sedition, but his death sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment if he reveals his cohorts' names. A belligerent Cullen refuses to cooperate, even when his head is repeatedly submerged in water. The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) delivers a telegraphed message to a sleeping Thomas Durant, who dismisses him. Durant then tells Lily, who lies in his bed, of the Indian massacre. Durant, Joseph (Eddie Spears) and a crew of armed men later board the train on a counterattack mission. After the train reaches the burning town and its survivors, Toole (Duncan Ollerenshaw) tells Durant that nine people were killed. Eva adds the attackers were not Cheyenne. When a band of Indians appears in the distance, Joseph sees that they are from the Sioux Nation and are sending Durant a message that he is now at war with them. Doc Whitehead (Grainger Hines) visits Cullen in jail. Cullen confesses that he murdered an innocent man and, when Doc attempts to comfort him, adds that he feels nothing about the act. Officers later drag a bound and blindfolded Cullen to a barn. Alone, Cullen takes off the hood and tries to escape but is surprised when Durant appears, smiling. Durant produces two documents: a warrant for Cullen's execution and a pardon. He claims that Cullen has \\"unfinished business\\" and then asks him to choose life or death. Over tea, Eva tells Lily she wants justice brought upon the man who murdered the prostitute. Lily agrees but stresses that it will be a difficult request to fulfill. Lily later joins Elam at the saloon and discreetly asks him to deal with the man who killed the prostitute. Elam refuses until she mentions that the request came from Eva. At church, Joseph and Ruth (Kasha Kropinski) distribute clothes and food to the Durant residents. A drunken Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) approaches and claims he is ready to preach, but Ruth asks him to leave and Joseph blocks his entry. Later that night, Reverend Cole drinks by the Swede's bonfire. Cole prophesizes that the railroad will wipe out the Indians, but the Swede argues that the Sioux's legendary \\"White Spirit\\" will prevail. He shows Cole a sign: a sabre-toothed animal skull he dug up by the riverside. Cullen is brought to Durant's train and shackled to a bench. Durant punches Cullen for robbing his railroad and they both later wonder if they have made the right decision. When Durant gets too close, Cullen wraps the chain around his neck, challenging him to ask for his own stay of execution. Durant holds out, but Cullen releases him. Durant says that sometimes one has to make a deal with the devil. Cullen asks who the devil is in this deal. Durant tosses him the key to his shackles and exits the train car. At Hell on Wheels, Elam confronts Schmidt (Brian Jensen), accusing him of murdering the prostitute. A brazen Schmidt scoffs at Elam's accusations. Elam draws his gun and threatens to shoot Schmidt, but Schmidt dismisses the threat, saying that a gunshot would attract too much attention. Elam agrees and walks away. Schmidt then inexplicably admits to killing the prostitute. Elam pulls out a knife and stabs him repeatedly in the stomach. When Cullen and Durant arrive at Hell on Wheels, Durant says that he trusts Cullen's word that he will not leave town, acknowledging an approaching Elam and saying he could always get Elam to shoot him. Elam welcomes Cullen, telling him he will need a gun. As Cullen makes his way through Hell on Wheels, Lily, Joseph, Sean, and various other residents are all stunned by his arrival. He passes a mob of people throwing stones at Schmidt's corpse, which bears a sign that reads \\"woman killer.\\" Cullen arrives at his new quarters, the Swede's old caboose. As he looks out from the doorway, he sees the Swede, who gives him a knowing smile and walks away.

This isn't great (or perhaps even good) television by most conventional definitions, but I still enjoyed the hell out of it on its own slightly ridiculous terms.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying, \\"This second episode really captured the whole atmosphere of the show and provided the perfect seeds for what is to come.\\" Production *\\"Durant, Nebraska\\" (a nod to the real-life Durant, Polk County, Nebraska) is in the show is largely owned by its founder, Thomas C. \\"Doc\\" Durant. The real-life Durant, Polk County, Nebraska is an unincorporated community established when the Union Pacific Railroad was extended to that point, during the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad. *In season 3, General Ulysses S. Grant tells Cullen Bohannon that Durant, Nebraska was renamed Cheyenne, Wyoming (also a real city), after Thomas C. \\"Doc\\" Durant was ruined. Multiple plot lines in season 3 and season 4 prominently feature the renamed community. *As in the TV series, the location of the real-life Cheyenne, Wyoming was chosen as the point where the Union Pacific Railroad crossed Crow Creek, a tributary of the South Platte River. The real-life city's rapid growth, due to the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, which reached Cheyenne on November 13, 1867, earned Cheyenne, Wyoming the nickname \\"Magic City of the Plains\\".

He is director of Forensic Rehabilitation Research at the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group, where he says his research focuses on pedophilia, sexual offenses committed against children, child pornography, risk assessment, offenders with mental disorders, psychopathy, and program evaluation. He is editor in chief of Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, the official journal of the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, and an associate editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior, the official journal of the International Academy of Sex Research.

He is an associate professor at the University of Toronto and holds cross-appointments to Ryerson University, Carleton University, and the University of Ottawa.  Career  Seto received a B.Sc. (1989) in biopsychology from University of British Columbia, completed his M.A. (1992) and Ph.D. (1997) in clinical psychology at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. He worked at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (and its predecessor, the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry) from 1994 to 2008, before moving to the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group in 2008, first as a consultant and then as the director of Forensic Rehabilitation Research. He serves as Scientific Advisor to Thorn,https://www.wearethorn.org/about-our-fight- against-sexual-exploitation-of-children/ a company that partners across the tech industry, government and NGOs and leverage technology to combat predatory behavior, rescue victims, and protect vulnerable children. Thorn is co-Founded by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.  Research  Seto has been noted as \\"one of the foremost authorities\\" on adolescent sex offenders. Much of his research has focused on the psychological characteristics of sex offenders, their risk for reoffending, and the relationship between paraphilias and sexual offending. He has suggested in his book on pedophilia and sexual offending that perhaps 3% of men are sexually attracted to prepubescent children.Seto, M. C. (2008). Pedophilia and sexual offending against children: Theory, assessment, and intervention. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Pedophilia is related to sexual offending against children, but they are not synonymous: Some pedophiles are not known to have ever committed sexual offenses against children, and some offenders are not pedophiles, motivated instead by high sex drive, criminality, or opportunism.Seto, M. C. (2009). Pedophilia. Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 5, 391-407. doi: 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.032408.153618 Controversially, Seto has suggested that pedophilia can be understood as a sexual orientation with regard to age, just as heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality can be understood as sexual orientations with regard to gender.Seto, M. C. (2012). Is pedophilia a sexual orientation? Archives of Sexual Behavior, 41, 231-236. In his research on online offending, Seto has discovered that there may be a closer link between pedophilia and child pornography use than between pedophilia and sexual offending against children directly.Seto, M. C., Cantor, J. M., & Blanchard, R. (2006). Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 115, 610-615. doi: 10.1037/0021-843X.115.3.610Seto, M. C., Reeves, L., & Jung, S. (2010). Motives for child pornography offending: The explanations given by the offenders. Journal of Sexual Aggression, 16, 169-180. doi: 10.1080/13552600903572396. This does not mean pedophilia is the only motivation, but it does appear to be the most important. Despite this strong association with pedophilia, online sexual offenders appear to be at relatively low risk of reoffending, suggesting other factors such as personality must be involved.Seto, M. C., Hanson, R. K., & Babchishin, K. M. (2011). Contact sexual offending by men with online sexual offenses. Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 23, 124-145. doi:10.1177/1079063210369013 In related research, he and his colleagues have demonstrated that the same kinds of risk factors are valid for online offenders as they are for conventional contact offenders, including age, criminal history, substance use, and sexual attraction to children.Seto, M. C., & Eke, A. W. (2005). The future offending of child pornography offenders. Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17, 201-210. doi: 10.1177/107906320501700209Eke, A. W., Seto, M. C., & Williams, J. (2011). Examining the criminal history and future offending of child pornography offenders: An extended prospective follow-up study. Law and Human Behavior, 35, 466-478. doi:10.1007/s10979-010-9252-2 This research is summarized in his book on online sexual offending.Seto, M. C. (2013). Internet Sex Offenders. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.  Views  In describing pedophiles, Seto emphasizes that there are few outward signs. He told USA Today, \\"People would feel better if there was a profile, but there really isn't.\\" \\"It can be a priest, a coach, or a teacher. It could be a person who is a trusted member of the community. They are employed. They have friends. It doesn't fit with the idea that this person is different in some way that we could notice and protect ourselves.\\" Serial child molesters seek out vulnerable children and cultivate relationships with them, Seto said. \\"They are not picking children at random.\\" Rather, \\"They are seeking out children who will be more receptive to their approach‚Äîchildren who may be socially isolated, impoverished, lacking a father figure.\\" Seto described child pornography offenders as often being socially isolated, spending long stretches of time online, and being secretive about their online activities.\\"Several studies have suggested that child pornography offenders become increasingly involved online, sometimes spending hours every day searching for more content, as well as spending time on related sites\\" like youth-oriented forums or chat rooms, he said. There also appears to be an age difference, according to Seto: \\"People on average under 35 are more familiar with the technology than those who are over 35, and the arrests reflect that.\\" In 2007, Seto's research team received a $66,000 (Canadian) research grant to study child pornography offenders, comparing those who do with those who do not go on to commit future offences. Ontario politician George Smitherman criticized the study and the Ontario Mental Health Foundation for funding the project, because the study subjects would receive money for agreeing to participate ($60 Canadian). Seto responded that he was unsurprised the study has generated controversy. He said \\"I do understand why people are concerned about this, but I hope they don't lose sight of the fact that we're doing this research to understand pedophilia and sexual offending,\\" and that it is standard practice to pay people to take part in clinical studies. According to OMHF, \\"The new knowledge to be gained from the proposed study would contribute to our theoretical understanding of the origins of sexual offending against children, because it would help identify factors that influence the likelihood that someone with a sexual attraction to children will act upon that attraction.\\"  References  Category:1967 births Category:Canadian sexologists Category:Canadian psychologists Category:Living people Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:Writers from Ottawa Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Toronto faculty ","title":"Michael C.

It is not known how many buildings stood on the site over the centuries, but in 1750, the Bishop Frederik Nannestad wrote that the Kv√¶fjord Church was a red, wooden, cruciform church. A little after 1760, a new church was built on the same site. It was a log church in a cruciform design. That church only lasted about 120 years and then in 1866-1867 it was torn down and replaced with the present church. The cost for the new church was 5,565 speciedaler, 1 ort, and 10 skilling.

The Articles of the Union were signed on April 22, 1964 by the Founders of the Union, Julius Nyerere and Abeid Amani Karume and agreed in 11 matters which later increased to over 22 and are the source of tension and dispute between Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar.see Uamsho movementhttp://zanzibardaima.com/2009/04/17/union-of- tanganyika-and-zanzibar-african-initiative-or-cold-war-rivalry/ The original Articles of Union which contain both Signatures from Nyerere and Karume are yet to be found. Background history The United Republic of Tanzania was formed on 26 April 1964 as a result of the Union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. Julius Kambarage Nyerere became the first President of the United Republic of Tanzania and Sheikh Abeid Karume became the First Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania and the President of Zanzibar and Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. The late Rashidi Mfaume Kawawa became the second Vice President of Tanzania and leader of Government business in the National Assembly. Like other African countries, the people of Tanganyika opposed and fought against colonial invaders from the very beginning. This included the formation of African Associations in both Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The African Association was established in Tanganyika in 1929. This association was transformed into the Tanganyika African Association (TAA) in 1948. In 1953 under the leadership of Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere, TAA was recognised as a political party and was transformed into the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in 1954.http://www.tanserve.com/facts/index_files/history.htm On Zanzibar's part, the various football clubs established in the early 1930s provided the basis for the coming together of members of the African community. By 1934,members of the African community united in a formal organisation known as the African Association (AA). The formation of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP) in 1955 forced leaders of the African Association and the Shirazi Association to unite. In 1957, the Shirazi Association and African Association united to form the Afro-Shirazi Party under the leadership of Sheikh Abeid Amani Karume.http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/tz-zan.html Signing of the Agreements It is believed that the agreement for the unification of the two states was signed by the first President of Tanganyika, the late Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere, and the first Zanzibar President, the late Sheikh Abeid Amani Karume, on 22 April 1964, in Zanzibar. Although the Original Articles of the union does not exist, It was agreed that, to become valid The Articles of the Union must be ratified by both Tanganyika's Parliament and Zanzibar revolutionary council, the Articles was ratified by Tanganyika's Parliament on 26 April 1964 but was not ratified by the Zanzibar Revolutionary Council as per agreement.http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=245022 (WIPO Lex) On 27 April 1964, the leaders of the two countries exchanged legal documents of the Union at the Karimjee Hall in Dar es Salaam. The Articles of the Union declared the formation of the United Republic in Section 4. Critics and Grievances Since its formation in 1964 under the Tanzania first President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere any discussion or debate concerning the union and its legality was never allowed in Tanzania and could lead to criminal charges to anyone who conducts such discussion or debate, that including Government officials, such person could be seen as an enemy of the Nation. Knowledge and education about the union was never conducted and Tanzania citizen had no knowledge about the Union, its benefits and the reason of the union. The original Articles of Union which contain 11 matter was never existed and So often Zanzibar Government asked about it only to receive negative results. In Private and Public funded Education,Union topic or history was never a part of it even in General studies and Civic studies. The only place where union matter appears is in the exams in the form of \\"When was the union formed?\\" And this led to number of critics and grievances since the Nyerere's era to present. Second President of Zanzibar Aboud Jumbe was among the first public figure to fall on the trap. In 1984 Jumbe and his colleagues, including his Chief Minister Seif Sharif Hamad, attempted to push for more autonomy for Zanzibar. As a result, Aboud Jumbe was pressured by the union government to resign his posts as vice president of Tanzania and president of Zanzibar in January 1984. His Chief Minister, Seif Sharif Hamad was detained, and On January 1988 Unceremoniously dropped from the Revolutionary Council and dropped as the Chief Minister of Zanzibar, on May 1988 he was Expelled from the ruling CCM with six colleagues and automatically lost his parliamentary seat in the Zanzibar House of Representatives. On May 1989 he was arrested and taken to court to face (politically motivated) trumped up charges of allegedly being found with government secret documents believed to be the Article of Union. From 1989‚Äì1991 he was Reprimanded in the Zanzibar Central Prison.http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Tanzania-HISTORY.html#b Among the Critics including, between 1964 and 1973 in six other things - elements seen in 12 to 16 of the First Additional - were added to the list of Union Matters. Thus, in 1965 the issues of finance, currency and banking were added, in 1967 the manufacturing licences and statistics, higher education and what was in Annex X of the Charter of the East African Community was expanded, in 1968 was expanded to the natural resources of oil, petroleum and natural gas, and in 1973 issues of the National Examinations Council was expanded. 1984 addition of elements of Annex X of the Charter of the East African Community to create four independent list, transportation and aviation, research, weather forecast and data. Similarly, changes of Constitution had raised new thing on the list of the Union Matters: Court of Appeal of Tanzania. In addition, section 3, i.e. Defense, was amended to become 'safety and security.' And in 1992 'the registration of political parties' was added to the list of Union Matters. Also the issue of removing power to Zanzibar President to seize being the Vice President of Tanzania created a fierce debatehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mabadilikotanzania/Y0jlfa6rypc/hfsvBHtyhqEJ In addition, the Interim Constitution, 1965 that Dominant in Tanzania until 1977 passed the law of Annex II of the Constitution to make provision that the Act can not be adjusted without amendment supported by two-thirds of all members of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. Similarly, the Constitution specifies, in the First Additional, that any one of the legal changes requires support from two-thirds of all members in \\"Chapter 557 (Edition 1965), Laws of the Union Treaty Verification of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964,but unfortunately all addition Matters of the union did not follow the law and were inserted locally. Complaints from Zanzibar Complaints from Zanzibar started before the assassination of Zanzibar first President Sheikh Abeid Amani Karume Snr. According to one of the first President of Zanzibar Revolution Council,Nassor Hassan Moyo, who was also a minister for many years in Tanzania the decision to Unite Tanganyika and Zanzibar was Nyerere opinion. Among the first thing Nyerere suggested to Karume snr.was to unite the two Countries and then came the articles of Union later on the creation of the Union constitution.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-0CxOQaz5U&feature;=relmfu In the 1970s Nyerere decision to send Soldiers from Zanzibar to fight liberation of Mozambique without Karume's Knowledge was among the first clashes between Zanzibar and Tanganyika. Karume decision to return the Soldier caused Nyerere and Karume not to speak face to face from that day to the death of Karume, after three days Zanzibar revolutionary council met to decide the fate of the Union and prepared special request letter which contained five or six matters which was sent to Nyerere to change the list of the articles of Union, the list including Tanzania president should seek advice to Zanzibar president in any decision including Announcement of State of emergency,Police to be excluded in Union Matters,International relation should be equal and Each country should have its own Currency.

It was founded in 1980 by Qin Benli (), who acted as its chief editor until its closure by the Communist Party of China Shanghai government in May 1989, after the Tiananmen Square incident. The Herald gained a reputation for being one of the most influential, forthright, and liberal weekly newspapers in China during the 1980s, a period of relative freedom in the country's modern history. It excelled in publishing editorials and news pushing political and economic reform in China. History The Herald was founded in April 1980. For decades, since the founding of the Republic in 1949, the press had been tightly controlled by the Communist Party of China and used almost exclusively for the purposes of political communication‚Äîfrom the Party's leaders to the populace. No private publications were allowed to exist. After the launching of reforms after the Cultural Revolution, however, there was a blossoming of print publication in China. The number of newspapers in China went from 200 nationally in 1976 to 320 in 1979, the year after the beginning of reforms. By the first half of the 1980s, less than half of the newspapers in the country had been established in the last five years. By 1987 there were 2,509 newspapers in China, 255 of which were printed daily. The Herald, based in Shanghai, became one of the most liberal and outspoken in all of China. It gained this role quickly primarily due to its 'independence,' that is political independence, since its founding. It was self-financed and free from institutional links to the Communist Party and government. The paper introduced new ideas about economic reform and development, popularizing economic knowledge related to both domestic and international matters. The Herald was praised for helping to promote China's economic reforms and it was considered \\"an authority on both world and national economic issues,\\" according to Won Ho Chang, Professor and Director of the Stephenonson Research Center at the University of Missouri's School of Journalism. In its first two years it focused primarily on matters of international economics, before expanding to coverage of China's economy. By the late 1980s the paper's orientation was that without political reform, economic reform would eventually be ineffectual. The paper never formally endorsed by the Party, but it was printed under the sponsorship of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and the World Economic Society. It sometimes thus had to pay more for newsprint and distribution (through the postal system). The Herald used to be printed on the presses of the Liberation Daily and did not have to submit proofs for scrutiny before going to press. =Political impact= Like newspapers that have succeeded it in the digital age, such as Caijing and the Nanfang newspapers, the Herald was able to survive in times of political difficulty because its editor-in-chief exercised careful judgement. \\"Qin Benli was adept at gauging the political climate, lying low when necessary and resurfacing at the appropriate moment.\\" The political impact of the Herald went beyond mere survivability. According to Lynn White II and Li Cheng, the development of the Herald was closely connected with China's \\"technocratic movement,\\" which helped popularize notions of \\"science\\" and \\"democracy.\\" Political development in the 1980s put emphasis on those ideas and the Herald played a \\"critical role\\" as part of this \\"elitist movement.\\"Li Cheng and Lynn T.

On the left side of the partition, the top and bottom parts are disconnected from each other. On the right side of the partition, all possible edges from top to bottom exist, forming a graph whose complement is disconnected. In graph theory, a skew partition of a graph is a partition of its vertices into two subsets, such that the induced subgraph formed by one of the two subsets is disconnected and the induced subgraph formed by the other subset is the complement of a disconnected graph. Skew partitions play an important role in the theory of perfect graphs. Definition A skew partition of a graph G is a partition of its vertices into two subsets X and Y for which the induced subgraph G[X] is disconnected and the induced subgraph G[Y] is the complement of a disconnected graph (co- disconnected). Equivalently, a skew partition of a graph G may be described by a partition of the vertices of G into four subsets A, B, C, and D, such that there are no edges from A to B and such that all possible edges from C to D exist; for such a partition, the induced subgraphs G[A\\\\cup B] and G[C\\\\cup D] are disconnected and co-disconnected respectively, so we may take X=A\\\\cup B and Y=C\\\\cup D. Examples Every path graph with four or more vertices has a skew partition, in which the co-disconnected set Y is one of the interior edges of the path and the disconnected set X consists of the vertices on either side of this edge. However, it is not possible for a cycle graph of any length to have a skew partition: no matter which subsets of the cycle are chosen as the set X, the complementary set Y will have the same number of connected components, so it is not possible for X to be disconnected and Y to be co-disconnected. If a graph has a skew partition, so does its complement. For instance, the complements of path graphs have skew partitions, and the complements of cycle graphs do not. Special cases If a graph is itself disconnected, then with only three simple exceptions (an empty graph, a graph with one edge and three vertices, or a four-vertex perfect matching) it has a skew partition, in which the co-disconnected side of the partition consists of the endpoints of a single edge and the disconnected side consists of all other vertices. For the same reason, if the complement of a graph is disconnected, then with a corresponding set of three exceptions it must have a skew partition.. If a graph has a clique separator (a clique whose removal would disconnect the remaining vertices) with more than one vertex, then the partition into the clique and the remaining vertices forms a skew partition. A clique cutset with one vertex is an articulation point; if such a vertex exists, then with a small number of simple exceptions, there is a skew partition in which the co-disconnected side consists of this vertex and one of its neighbors. A star cutset in a graph G is a vertex separator in which one of the separator vertices is adjacent to all the others. Every clique separator is a star cutset. Necessarily, a graph with a star cutset (with more than one vertex) has a skew partition in which the co-disconnected subgraph consists of the vertices in the star cutset and the disconnected subgraph consists of all the remaining vertices. A module (or homogeneous set) is a nontrivial subset H of the vertices of G such that, for every vertex v that is not in H, either v is adjacent to all vertices in H or to none of them. If a graph G has a module H and, outside it, there exist both vertices adjacent to all vertices in H and other vertices adjacent to none of them, then G has a star cutset consisting of one vertex in the module together with its neighbors outside the module. On the other hand, if there exists a module in which one of these two subsets is empty, then the graph is disconnected or co- disconnected and again (with the three simple exceptions) it has a skew cutset. History Skew partitions were introduced by , in connection with perfect graphs. Chv√°tal proved that a minimally imperfect graph could not have a star cutset. Trivially, disconnected graphs cannot be minimally imperfect, and it was also known that graphs with clique separators or modules could not be minimally imperfect.. The nonexistence of modules in minimally imperfect graphs was used by in his proof of the weak perfect graph theorem. Claude Berge had conjectured in the early 1960s that perfect graphs were the same as the Berge graphs, graphs with no induced odd cycle (of length five or more) or its complement, and (because cycles and their complements do not have skew partitions) no minimal non-Berge graph can have a skew partition. Motivated by these results, Chv√°tal conjectured that no minimally imperfect graph could have a skew partition. Several authors proved special cases of this conjecture, but it remained unsolved for many years.See for the case in which the co-disconnected side of the partition is multipartite, and for the case in which one of the two parts of the co-disconnected side is independent. Skew partitions gained significance when they were used by to prove the strong perfect graph theorem that the Berge graphs are indeed the same as the perfect graphs. Chudnovsky et al. were unable to prove Chv√°tal's conjecture directly, but instead proved a weaker result, that a minimal counterexample to the theorem (if it existed) could not have a balanced skew partition, a skew partition in which every induced path with endpoints on one side of the partition and interior vertices on the other side has even length. This result formed a key lemma in their proof, and the full version of Chv√°tal's lemma follows from their theorem.. In structural graph theory Skew partitions form one of the key components of a structural decomposition of perfect graphs used by as part of their proof of the strong perfect graph theorem. Chudnovsky et al. showed that every perfect graph either belongs to one of five basic classes of perfect graphs, or it has one of four types of decomposition into simpler graphs, one of which is a skew partition. A simpler example of a structural decomposition using skew partitions is given by . He observes that every comparability graph is complete, is bipartite, or has a skew partition. For, if every element of a partially ordered set is either a minimal element or a maximal element, then the corresponding comparability graph is bipartite. If the ordering is a total order, then the corresponding comparability graph is complete. If neither of these two cases arise, but every element that is neither minimal nor maximal is comparable to all other elements, then either the partition into the minimal and non-minimal elements (if there is more than one minimal element) or the partition into the maximal and non-maximal elements (if there is more than one maximal element) forms a star cutset. And in the remaining case, there exists an element x of the partial order that is not minimal, not maximal, and not comparable with all other elements; in this case, there is a skew partition (the complement of a star cutset) in which the co-disconnected side consists of the elements comparable to x (not including x itself) and the disconnected side consists of the remaining elements. The chordal graphs have an even simpler decomposition of a similar type: they are either complete or they have a clique separator. showed, analogously, that every connected and co-connected weakly chordal graph (a graph with no induced cycle or its complement of length greater than four) with four or more vertices has a star cutset or its complement, from which it follows by Chv√°tal's lemma that every such graph is perfect. Algorithms and complexity A skew partition of a given graph, if it exists, may be found in polynomial time. This was originally shown by but with an impractically large running time of O(n^{101}), where n is the number of vertices in the input graph. improved the running time to O(n^4m); here m is the number of input edges. It is NP-complete to test whether a graph contains a skew partition in which one of the parts of the co-disconnected side is independent.. Testing whether a given graph contains a balanced skew partition is also NP-complete in arbitrary graphs, but may be solved in polynomial time in perfect graphs..

The area lies south-eastern of the city-center, has a population of 11,000 (according to a December 31, 2009 census), and belongs to the south-eastern municipal district. Additionally, the locale is divided into two subvisions of Gremmendorf-West and Gremmendorf-East, of which the Gremmendorf-West subdivision is more central, and clearly larger by area. The locale of Gremmendorf encompasses the area of the Dortmund-Ems Canal to the large capelin and high bank. History Gremmendorf is probably less than 200 years old and is therefore one of the youngest locales in M√ºnster. On a contemporary map of M√ºnster from the year 1763, Gremmendorf is nowhere to be found. The locale is the result of a small settlement around the farmyard of Gremme in the Delstrup peasantry. The Delstrup, along with the Geist and Mecklenbeck peasantries belonged to the rural community of Lamberti, and the authority of Mauritz. Delstrup became incorporated into the urban area of M√ºnster in 1903, due to the city's expansion. Due to this expansion on October 1, 1903, the M√ºnster-Neubeckum route of the Westphalian state railway opened, with a stop at the Erbdrosten Way, which was later to be called Gremmendorf. In the years to come, the name Delstrup eventually faded out in favour of what it is known as today. The restaurant Waldesruh, known today as Haus Heuckmann, was first built in 1905 at Gremmendorfer Way, and in the same year was added to the then new train station as part of the same facility. In following years, barracks for Prussian military personal were built around Gremmendorfer Way due to armed mobilization in preparation for the First World War. This effort was also supported by the transformation of the Loddenheide from an industrial area to a military base, as well as the building of Luftnachrichtenkaserne 1936 ( radio transmission outpost 1936), at Albersloher Way. Ever since 1920, one differentiates Old-Gremmendorf (farmyards around Erbdrosten Way) and New- Gremmendorf in lieu of new settlement around Gremmendorfer Way. After the Second World War, the barracks originally intended for German soldiers were taken over and utilized by British occupational forces as part of Osnabr√ºck Garrison. (Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, the country was divided into 4 separate sectors: American, French, British, and Soviet; the Soviet area would eventually be known as East Germany). Due to this, the residential density of Old-Gremmendorf sharply rose, especially around Albersloher Way. In 1975, Gremmendorf was officially assigned as part of the south-eastern municipal district. Culture Culturally, Gremmendorf offers a community association, known as K.-G. P√§ngelanton. Connected to the association are the Niederdeutsche Heimat-B√ºhne (a theatrical group performing plays in the Low German dialect), and a sports club, SC Gremmendorf since 1946. Current notable figures include Heinrich L√∂we, as founder, and Hermann Treff, as longtime chairman of the locale‚Äôs prestigious gun club, Otto Hersing, a U-Boot captain of the First World War, as well as Franz and Josef Horstmann as co-founders of SC Gremmendorf since 1946. Gremmendorf‚Äôs largest church community is the Roman Catholic St. Ida Gemeinde, who‚Äôs church is situated at Anton-Knubel Way. Particularities There isn‚Äôt a single independent street in Gremmendorf. Almost all roads end in Way, as likely observed in above paragraphs. Sights Locomotive P√§ngelanton, belonging to the railway history museum of the same name Next to the long shopping street in the locale-center, is Gremmendorf‚Äôs main landmark. It is a classic steam locomotive, called P√§ngelanton, which is at the crossing of Albersloher and Erbdrosten Way. Gremmendorf is also known for the British York barracks, on Albersloher Way. The memorial at Gremmendorfer Way is a monument to the fallen soldiers of the Second World War. Every year, members of Gremmendorf‚Äôs community clubs, as well as members of the St. Ida Gemeinde gather for Volkstrauertag.

He is considered to have been one of the highest-ranking KGB moles in Israel. Early life and career Shimon Levinson was born in Jerusalem during the British Mandate era in 1933. In 1950, he enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). From 1950 to 1953, he served as a member of the Israel-Jordan Armistice Committee. In 1954, he was appointed army attache to Turkey, but that same year, he returned to the armistice committee as a coordinator between the IDF Intelligence Corps and the Jordanian Army, serving in this position until 1960. Though he repeatedly failed his officer exams, he was repeatedly promoted and eventually reached the honorary rank of Colonel. From 1960 to 1961, he participated in a vocational high course for intelligence, and was appointed head of the documentation section of the Military Intelligence Directorate. He eventually left the IDF out of frustration for not being promoted any further, and for a year, served as CEO of the Government Coins and Medals Corporation, but was forced into resignation after he filed a false complaint on corruption and mismanagement. In March 1963, he was recruited by Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, and served in its Jerusalem field office as head of a security vetting team. In 1965, he was transferred to Mossad, the Israeli external intelligence service, at his own request, and was employed in credibility checks. He was employed in Mossad until March 1967, and returned to the Israel-Jordan Armistice Committee until its dissolution in July 1967. He later joined Israel's United Nations liaison unit, and eventually became its commander, serving until 1970. He then returned to Mossad and joined TEVEL, the Mossad department responsible for liaison with allied governments, and served two years as head of the TEVEL station in Ethiopia. He was in charge of organizing secret military aid to the Ethiopian government in its war against Eritrean rebels. He was reposted to Israel after causing a security mishap, and served as special assistant to the head of special liaison until 1973. In July 1973, he was reposted as IDF liaison colonel to the UN. He served in this position until 1978, when he retired from the IDF out of frustration over the refusal of IDF Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan to promote him any further. After retiring from the IDF, Levinson exploited his connections with senior UN officials and arranged for himself to be posted to Thailand as head of a UN agency fighting the drug trade in East Asia, a job with a high salary. He served until June 1983, and near the end of his UN service in Thailand, he ran into financial troubles after repeated failed attempts to start his own businesses. KGB career In April 1983, Levinson entered the Soviet embassy in Bangkok and offered to spy for the KGB, hoping to earn enough money to bail him out of his financial problems. He would later admit to his Shin Bet interrogators that his sole motivation was money. Levinson would spy for the Soviet Union for a total of seven years, during which he would make $31,000 - far less than what he had hoped for. Levinson was accepted, and sent to Moscow for tests. He was trained in the art of coded messages, radio communications, and secret rendezvous, and told what kind of information the KGB was interested in. He subsequently provided his handlers the structure of the Israeli intelligence community, providing detailed information including names and details of units, sub-units, identities of their chiefs, and their modus operandi, details on the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and even provided to KGB with original documents, and information on US intelligence officers in contact with Israeli intelligence. He also described to them the Israeli political system. In 1984, he returned to Israel and tried to rejoin Mossad, but was rejected due to his character and traits. However, in May 1985, one of his friends, Maj. Gen. (ret.) Avraham Tamir, who was serving as Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office, appointed Levinson Chief Security Officer upon the recommendations of Prime Minister Shimon Peres and former IDF and Shin Bet officers. This new job gave him access to all classified information available to the Prime Minister, which he turned over to the KGB. He also provided his KGB handlers with the structure of the Prime Minister's Office. Capture and trial In May 1991, Mossad, through information from a foreign source, identified Levinson as a spy. He was lured back to Israel from abroad and arrested at Ben-Gurion International Airport. During his interrogation, he made a full confession. He was tried in the Tel Aviv District Court. The details of the trial were kept secret. During his trial, some of his friends from the military and security services, including Ariel Sharon and Rafi Eitan, testified on his behalf. He was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Imprisonment and later life Levinson served seven years of his twelve-year sentence, and was released in 1999 after a third of his sentence had been deducted for good behavior. While imprisoned, his cellmate was Marcus Klingberg, another convicted Soviet spy. While he was imprisoned, his wife left him, his friends and colleagues dissociated themselves from him, and he was expelled from various organizations that he had been a part of, including the IDF Veterans Association. Following his release, he was subjected to a stay of exit order that prevented him from leaving Israel until the end of his original sentence in 2003. When Levinson was released, he rented an apartment in Jerusalem, and became socially secluded. When his stay of exit term expired, he moved to Thailand, where he found work as an agricultural consultant. He currently lives in Thailand, and only returns to Israel for brief visits.

The site was first explored by the English geologist Sir Henry George Lyons in 1892, and was excavated by the French Egyptologist Jean Vercoutter from 1962 to 1969. In addition to the fort, excavations uncovered the remains of two cities, one of which was fortified, a northern enclosure, two cemeteries, a boat slide, and a port. Construction of the Aswan High Dam caused the disappearance of Mirgissa, which now lies under the waters of Lake Nubia. Geography View of the plain to the northeast. Travelers from the north who reached Abusir had to leave their boats and circumvent the 2nd cataract in order to reach Mirgissa. It was situated from the harbor, where boats from the south could dock in calm waters, the rapids of the cataract preventing them from continuing their journey further north.Vercoutter (1970), pp. 4-5 Its lofty geographic position allowed sentries to observe the movement of troops for miles around.Vercoutter (1970), pp. 6-7 History Even before the great fort, an open town existed at Mirgissa. It went on to become a frontier post and trade center; it also served as a river control point at the 2nd cataract. The occupation of the region dates back to 7500 BCE as shown by the evidence obtained at Akha, an important Mesolithic site located a few hundred meters east of the great fortress. Large stone tools, dating from 3500 BCE, were found in several places of the plain. They demonstrate that Mirgissa was occupied in Neolithic times. But the occupation was at its height during the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period of ancient Egypt, and to a lesser extent, during the New Kingdom. Perspective reconstruction of Mirgissa While Senusret I probably established the fortification site within the northern enclosure, the great fortress was mainly the work of Senusret III. A stele, dated to year 8 of the reign of Senusret III, was discovered near the fortress of Semna. Its inscription stresses the economic importance of Mirgissa. Its translation reads: :\\"The southern frontier made in regnal year 8 under the majesty of the King of Upper and Loer Egypt Khakaure (may he live for ever and ever) in order to prevent it being passed by an Nubian journeying north by land or in a kai-boat as well as any livestock belonging to Nubians, with the exception of a Nubian who shall come to traffic at Mirgissa or on an embassy, or on any matter which may lawfully be done with them; but it shall be forbidden for any kai-boat of the Nubians to pass northwards beyond Semna for ever.\\" During the Twelfth Dynasty, it served as a customs post for travels heading north to Egypt. The periods of most intense occupation date from the Thirteenth Dynasty and then the Hyksos era, as evidenced by the large number of beetles found on the premises. The great fortress was then re-occupied during the Eighteenth Dynasty, followed by a sharp decline until the Twentieth Dynasty. Sporadically occupied at the time Meroitic era, the abandonment of the site was final during the early Christian era. House surrounded by a corrugated wall. ;City Mirgissa's open city predates its fortification. Situated north-northeast of the great fortress, it stretched over a area. In its early development, the city was protected by a stone wall thick, though the residential area later spread outside the walled section. According to various artifacts unearthed at the site, such as jars, millstones, bread molds, beer mugs, and plates, the city appeared to have been occupied by a strictly Egyptian population during the Middle Empire and the Second Intermediate Period. Of the two older excavated houses, the first was surrounded by a rectangular corrugated brick wall, while the second, a stone hut, was mainly rectangular though it contained circular elements. ;Cemeteries The multiple cemeteries at Mirgissa establish a continuous settlement here from the late Middle Kingdom through the New Kingdom: * M-Fe, late Second Intermediate Period * M-III, Kerma culture, Second Intermediate Period * MX, late Middle Kingdom-Second Intermediate Period * MX-TC, late Twelfth Dynasty- early Thirteenth Dynasty * MX-TD, first half of the 18th Dynasty Fortress The great fort's wall and towers are examples of Ancient Egyptian architecture. Narrow passage by the north gate of the great fortress. The great fortress dominated the western Wadi. It was built by the pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom to defend their southern border and control trade routes that passed through the Nile from Sudan and Africa. From a strategic and commercial standpoint, Mirgissa was of importance as it ensured economic exchanges between the Kingdom of Kush and Egypt. Together with Dabenarti, situated on a rocky islet measuring ,Vercoutter (1970), p. 18 the two fortresses formed a barrier to prevent invasions from the south. During excavations, only the foundation remained of the smaller Dabenarti fort, dating from the Twelfth Dynasty, its purpose having been to protect the harbor and dock located at the southern end of The Boat Slide. The great fortress was abandoned during the reign of Neferhotep I. While eleven forts were built during the reign of Senusret III in the region between the 2nd and 3rd cataracts, including Shalfak, Uronarti, Askut, Semna, Kumma, and Sumna South, Mirgissa was the largest of them. The great fortress covered more than . Its double wall with bastions and square-cornered towers, high, protected the city. The walls were more than thick and over high. Both entrances were protected by a ditch. The south side, facing the Nile, was protected by a fortified wall, which perfectly fit the rocky peaks on which it was underpinned. Two enormous gates were flanked to the north and near the southeast corner of the river. The north gate had a narrow passage, its access blocked by two massive wooden doors and a portcullis. Angled bedding-planes enabled the uphill brickwork. Excavations revealed a small temple dedicated to the goddess Hathor and a stele mentioning this goddess as the mistress of Iken; this discovery enabled positive identification of the fortress. Port and boat slide Boat slide During excavations, few traces of the port were evident, probably due to an exceptional flood. However, the French expedition identified the remains of a boat slipway,Nicholson (2000), p. vii over in length. It extended to the natural harbor in the south. It served as a slide for hauling boats who wanted to pass the 2nd cataract. Composed of evenly spaced wooden cross beams set in silt and spread mud layers, it was low enough to wet the clay and make it very slippery, thus reducing friction between the boat hull and the track. Archaeological finds The expedition of Jean Vercoutter made a discovery in the surrounding desert, west and not far from the city open, of a grave filled with some 3,500 fragments of pottery sherds; some were inscribed. The Execration texts listed the names of foreign countries and their leaders, their purpose apparently being a form of ritual magic designed to curse the enemies of Egypt. It is highly likely that once the text was written on a vase, it was broken and its fragments buried in the grave. Near this place, three statues dating from the Twelfth Dynasty were also unearthed, as well as a seal from Nebiryraw I of the Sixteenth Dynasty.

Background and life prior to Later Tang's establishment  Zhao Feng was probably born during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang in the late 870s or early 880s, as he would describe himself as either 49 or in his 50s in 934 shortly before his death,History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 67.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 28.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. but the exact year is not known. It is known, however, that he was from You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing). In his youth, he became a Confucian scholar. As he was later referred to as a Jinshi (), he probably also passed the imperial examinations during Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. The region eventually came under control of the warlord Liu Shouguang the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered at You Prefecture), and sometime after Liu became a nominal vassal of Tang's successor state Later Liang (the first of the five dynasties that controlled the Central Plains in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period) and received the title of Prince of Yan, Liu decided to conscript as many men into his army as possible and tattoo their faces. Many scholars were fearful of this fate and became Buddhist monks to avoid this. Zhao was one of those who took tonsure to avoid this fate, although he subsequently fled to Yan's neighboring state Jin, and came to serve on staff of Liu Shouguang's brother Liu Shouqi (), who had also fled to Jin to avoid his brother's rule. In 912, when Jin's prince Li Cunxu launched a major attack on Yan (which Liu Shouguang had proclaimed a separate empire by that point with himself being emperor), commanded by his major general Zhou Dewei, Liu Shouqi accompanied Zhou on the campaign. When Zhou put Yan's Zhuo Prefecture (Ê∂øÂ∑û, in modern Baoding, Hebei) under siege, the prefect Liu Zhiwen () initially defended the city against the siege, but when Liu Shouqi appeared at the city walls to persuade him to surrender, he did. Zhou, however, was jealous of Liu Shouqi's easily being able to persuade Liu Zhiwen to surrender, and made a false accusation against Liu Shouqi to Li. When Li subsequently summoned Liu Shouqi to his presence, Liu Shouqi, not sure what Li would do, fled with Zhao and another staff member, Liu Qufei (), to Later Liang. Later Liang's Emperor Taizu commissioned Liu Shouqi as the prefect of Bo Prefecture (ÂçöÂ∑û, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong), and Zhao accompanied Liu Shouqi to Bo Prefecture to serve as his secretary. It was not stated in historical accounts whether Zhao also accompanied Liu Shouqi to Shunhua Circuit (È†ÜÂåñ, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) when Later Liang took it from Yan in 913 and made Liu Shouqi its military governor (Jiedushi), but it was said that after Liu Shouqi's subsequent death, Zhao became the secretary to the military governor of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong).  During Later Tang  = During Emperor Zhuangzong's reign = In 923, Li Cunxu declared himself emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong), claiming to be the legitimate successor to Tang. Soon thereafter, in a surprise attack across the Yellow River commanded by Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan, Later Tang forces captured Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture (). Li Siyuan took Zhao Feng and the deputy military commander Cui Dang () captive and delivered them to Emperor Zhuangzong's then-location, Xingtang (ËààÂîê, in modern Handan, Hebei).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Emperor Zhuangzong, who had been impressed with Zhao's reputation previously, made him an imperial scholar with the title of Huluan Xueshi (). After he completed the conquest of Later Liang later in the year, he gave Zhao the more formal imperial scholar title of Hanlin Xueshi () and also made him Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). During Emperor Zhuangzong's reign, Zhao became known for his frank advice to Emperor Zhuangzong ‚Äî which the emperor appreciated but rarely accepted. For example, in 924, when Emperor Zhuangzong's wife Empress Liu wanted to make the very wealthy ex-Later Liang official Zhang Quanyi her godfather, apparently because he offered her many gifts, Empress Liu asked Zhao to draft a letter thanking Zhang. Zhao, instead, submitted a secret petition to Emperor Zhuangzong, stating, \\"Ever since ancient times, there was no occasion when the mother of the territory under the heavens called a subject her father.\\" Emperor Zhuangzong praised Zhao for his frankness, but still allowed Empress Liu and Zhang to enter into this relationship.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. On another occasion, when Zhang's adoptive son Hao Jisun () was sentenced to death for a crime, Emperor Zhuangzong's close associates, including eunuchs and actors, wanted to confiscate Hao's considerable wealth. Zhao submitted another petition, pointing out that as an adoptive son to Zhang, Hao should not have had his separate wealth, and that confiscating the wealth that Hao maintained would give an impression that sentencing him to death was for the purpose of taking that wealth. It appeared that Emperor Zhuangzong also did not accept this advice. = During Emperor Mingzong's reign = In 926, Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in a mutiny at the capital Luoyang that spawned from a series of mutinies after the major general Guo Chongtao had been killed on the orders of Empress Liu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Li Siyuan, who had led one of the mutinies, then arrived at Luoyang and, after initially claiming the title of regent, later took the throne (as Emperor Mingzong). As Emperor Mingzong was illiterate, and his chief of staff (Shumishi) An Chonghui, while literate, was not well-versed in the literatures and history, Emperor Mingzong was having difficulty reacting to the petitions that came to him, as emperor. At An's suggestion, Emperor Mingzong thus established two high posts for imperial scholars at Duanming Palace (), and commissioned Zhao Feng and Feng Dao to serve in those posts. Zhao, while recommended by An, was also friendly with the chancellor Ren Huan, whom, however, An viewed as a political enemy, and who was removed from his chancellor post in 927, apparently under An's instigation. Later in the year, however, An, believing that Ren might join the general Zhu Shouyin in rebellion, persuaded Emperor Mingzong to order Ren to commit suicide. Despite An's power, Zhao, weeping, nevertheless stated to him, \\"Ren Huan is a righteous man; how would he consider rebelling? You, Lord, are so excessive in your punishments, and how can you govern the state like this?\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. It was said that An was shamed by Zhao's speech, but the speech apparently had no effect, as Ren's death was subsequently carried out. Prior to Emperor Mingzong's becoming emperor, a fortuneteller named Zhou Xuanbao () had stated to him that his appearance showed honor beyond measure. After Emperor Mingzong became emperor, he wanted to summon Zhou to his presence. Zhao recommended against this, stating: After Zhao's advice, Emperor Mingzong only gave Zhou an honorary commission and awards in gold and silk, and did not summon him. In 927, Emperor Mingzong had briefly moved his court from Luoyang to the eastern capital Kaifeng. (It was Emperor Mingzong's announcement of this movement that led to Zhu's rebellion, as Zhu, who was then Kaifeng's defender, believed that the move was targeting him.) In 928, Emperor Mingzong considered going from there to Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, i.e., the same city as Xingtang). The imperial guard soldiers were displeased that they had just had to move their families from Luoyang to Kaifeng and now faced a prospect of further moving them from Kaifeng to Yedu. Further, the warlord Wang Du the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding) also believed that the move was targeting him, and therefore prepared to resist. Despite this, most officials did not dare to oppose Emperor Mingzong's move. Zhao reported these issues to An and, in frank words, and An agreed; after An reported Zhao's advice to Emperor Mingzong, Emperor Mingzong stopped the planned movement to Yedu. On another occasion, when a Buddhist monk who had visited the Western Regions (Xiyu) regions offered to the emperor a relic that the monk claimed to be a tooth from a Buddha, Emperor Mingzong awarded the monk many gifts. Zhao pointed out that under Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's tooth should be indestructible, and asked to test it. He took an axe to it, and it crumbled easily. Emperor Mingzong thereafter stopped the awards to the monk. In 929, Emperor Mingzong made Zhao Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng)) and a chancellor, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). This brought displeasure from Zhao's fellow imperial scholar Yu Qiao (), who had been previously friendly with Zhao but who believed himself to be more capable than Zhao. Yu and another official, Xiao Xifu (), thereafter submitted a number of petitions that attacked the governance at the time but particularly targeting Zhao. Zhao became resentful of them, but did not initially react. Meanwhile, Yu also offended An based on a dispute that Yu had with one of his neighbors over a watermill, and at An's instruction, Zhao had Yu demoted to the less prestigious position of Mishu Shaojian (), the deputy head of the Palace Library. Yu wanted to discuss with Zhao about this, and so took wine to Zhao's house, intending to drink with Zhao and talk. Zhao knew what Yu wanted to see him for and therefore had his servant refuse the meeting for him, claiming that he was bathing. In anger, Yu urinated on the entryway of Zhao's servant's booth and cursed the servant. The servant instead claimed to Zhao that Yu cursed Zhao and urinated on Zhao's mansion door. Zhao reported this to Emperor Mingzong, who reacted by stripping Yu of his offices and exiling him, first to Wu Prefecture (Ê≠¶Â∑û, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), then to Zhenwu (ÊåØÊ≠¶, headquartered in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi). It was said that the people lamented this punishment as overly harsh. In 930, An, who had past grudges against Emperor Mingzong's adoptive son Li Congke, encouraged Li Congke's subordinate Yang Yanwen () to mutiny, to try to inculpate Li Congke. Li Congke was forced to flee to Luoyang. After Yang's mutiny was put down, An tried to have Feng and Zhao suggest to Emperor Mingzong that Li Congke should be punished for his lack of control over the army, but Emperor Mingzong rebuffed them, only having Li Congke return to his mansion. Subsequently, the officers Li Xingde () and Zhang Jian () encouraged one Bian Yanwen () into falsely accusing An of plotting a rebellion. Emperor Mingzong, disbelieving the accusation, immediately had Bian put to death, and later, at Zhao's suggestion, also had Li Xingde and Zhang, as well as their families, put to death. Still, An was under much attack for holding onto power too long, such that Emperor Mingzong considered replacing him and such that An himself offered to resign. Feng believed that what was best for An was for him to be relieved of his position as Shumishi. Zhao disagreed and argued to Emperor Mingzong that An, as his chief advisor, should not be easily removed. Emperor Mingzong agreed (at that time) and left An in his post as Shumishi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. In 931, with the Later Tang forces commanded by Emperor Mingzong's son-in-law Shi Jingtang having no success against two rebel generals, Meng Zhixiang the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and Dong Zhang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) ‚Äî whose rebellions were considered to be caused by An's suspicions against them ‚Äî An offered to head to the front to oversee the campaign himself. However, as soon as he left the capital, the general Zhu Hongzhao the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) accused An of plotting to take over Shi's army. Emperor Mingzong thereafter summoned An back to Luoyang, but even before An could reach there, instead commissioned him to be the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), a fairly surprising demotion for someone of such high power. With An's safety considered precarious at that point, Zhao wanted to try to save An and so stated to Emperor Mingzong: Emperor Mingzong came to believe that Zhao was in league with An, and therefore became very displeased. After An was subsequently ordered to retire, and then killed, Emperor Mingzong also sent Zhao out of the capital, to serve as the military governor of Anguo Circuit (ÂÆâÂúã, headquartered in modern Xingtai, Hebei), still carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary chancellor title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. It was said that while at Anguo, Zhao distributed his salaries to the officers, staff members, and guests, and did not keep wealth for himself. = After Emperor Mingzong's reign = Emperor Mingzong died in 933 and was succeeded by his biological son Li Conghou the Prince of Song (as Emperor Min). In 934, Emperor Min's leading advisors Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun, not wanting Shi Jingtang (who was then the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi)) and Li Congke (who was then the military governor of Fengxiang) to be entrenched, tried to move them both. Li Congke, believing that they had unfriendly intentions toward him, rebelled, and quickly advanced on Luoyang, forcing Emperor Min to flee to Wei Prefecture (Ë°õÂ∑û, in modern Xinxiang, Henan). When Zhao heard this, he initially wanted to take his soldiers and staff and immediately head to Wei Prefecture to attend to Emperor Min ‚Äî despite the dangers such an action might have ‚Äî and the soldiers were initially willing to follow him. He never carried out the journey, however, before news came that Emperor Min had been killed by emissaries sent by Li Congke. Li Congke subsequently took the throne. He summoned Zhao back to Luoyang to serve in the honorary post of Taizi Taibao (). However, due to a foot ailment, Zhao was unable to attend imperial meetings. When the illness became greater, Zhao tried to discern his own fortune using the I Ching, but as soon as he was about to discern the results, he tossed them aside, stating, \\"Our family has never had someone who reached the age of 49, and was for generations poor and unhonored. I have already reached that age, and had been both general and chancellor. Why do I want more years?\\" He died in 935.

The eighth tropical disturbance of the season, Ernest formed from a persistent area of thunderstorms in the central Indian Ocean. It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January 20 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph 10 minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January 23, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds. The next day the cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on January 25\\\\. On Mayotte, Ernest produced peak wind gusts of 98 km/h (61 mph). The storm drew moisture away from Malawi, causing a nine-day period of dry conditions. A few days after Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi affected the same region and produced further flooding. The combined effects of the storms killed 78 people and left over 32,000 homeless. Widespread crop damage sparked food protests, although the World Food Programme provided an emergency supply of rice to affected residents. Meteorological history An area of convection persisted on January 16 to the west of Diego Garcia, and that day M√©t√©o-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 08. The system maintained thunderstorms over a developing circulation, located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear. It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January 17\\\\. That day, the MF discontinued advisories after the system briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement to the west-southwest, and on January 19 began intensifying. That day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S to the north of the northern coast of Madagascar. After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January 20. After attaining tropical storm status, Ernest entered the Mozambique Channel and turned to the southwest. It developed outflow on opposite sides of the storm, and an eye gradually became evident. While strengthening, Ernest moved over Mayotte and passed southeast of Comoros. By late on January 20, the storm rapidly intensified over warm waters into a tropical cyclone - the equivalent of a 120 km/h (75 mph) hurricane. Around that time, Ernest had turned to the south, along the western periphery of a ridge. On January 22, MF upgraded the storm into an intense tropical cyclone with peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph 10 minute winds) when it was located off the west coast of Madagascar. At around the same time, the JTWC estimated Ernest attained peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph 1 minute sustained). While at peak intensity, Ernest was a small cyclone with gales extending 130 km (80 mi) outward from the well-defined eye. After maintaining peak winds for about 12 hours, the cyclone began weakening while turning to the southeast. On January 23, Ernest made landfall on the southwest coast of Madagascar at Itampolo, with winds estimated at 130 km/h (80 mph). The cyclone accelerated to the southeast across the island and quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Late on January 23, the JTWC issued its last advisory after Ernest began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Early the next day, MF declared Ernest extratropical, and continued tracking it until the storm dissipated on January 25 in the southern Indian Ocean. Impact and aftermath The storm first struck Mayotte, affecting the island with gale-force gusts for about six hours. Sustained winds reached 78 km/h (48 mph), and wind gusts peaked at 98 km/h (61 mph). Effects on the island were minimal. Cyclone Ernest indirectly affected Malawi, located inland in southeast Africa. The storm's circulation removed moisture from the country and prevented any rainfall from occurring in the southern part of the country during a nine-day period. In southern Madagascar, the cyclone produced high winds and heavy rainfall. The highest rainfall was a 24‚Äëhour total of , and the highest wind gust was , both of which observed in Toliara. Many fishermen in the area were not aware of the storm's approach, and several of them died as a result. About five days after Cyclone Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi struck the same general area, causing additional flooding. The combined effects of Ernest and Felapi killed 39 people, injured 104, and left 214 people missing as of February 25, 2005. Later, the death toll was finalized at 78 in the International Disaster Database. The storms damaged 5,792 buildings, and there were 32,191 people left homeless. The floods damaged about 4,483 hectares (11,078 acres) of crop fields in southern Madagascar. Portions of the country faced shortages of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, as well as from Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year. This caused prices to increase, resulting in street protests. As a result, the World Food Programme provided 45 tons of rice to affected residents, although persistent flooding disrupted relief work. In general, damage from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year. Madagascar's National Emergency Centre deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims.

She is the first female kgosikgolo in the history of Botswana. Early life Mosadi Seboko was born on 7 June 1950 in Ramotswa, south of Gaborone. Her name Mosadi literally means \\"woman\\" in Setswana, and she was given the English name \\"Muriel\\". Her father, Mokgosi II, expected a boy to be his oldest child, but upon seeing his daughter, he said, \\"Well, it's a woman. What can I do? It's my child.\\" In 1969, she graduated from Moeding College. Two years later, she became the department administrator at Barclay's Bank. She ended her six-year marriage with her abusive husband in 1978. Chieftainship Mosadi Seboko's brother was kgosikgolo from 1 June 1996 to 17 June 2001 when he died from an illness. Tumelo Seboko, an uncle of Mosadi, became acting kgosikgolo from 21 June 2001 to 7 January 2002. Mosadi's mother and sisters pushed her to become the next kgosikgolo during this time, which would break a history of solely male dikgosikgolo. At the time of the installation, she worked as a floor manager at Century Office Supplies in Broadhurst. Mosadi based her claim for bogosi on the \\"birthright equity\\"; since she was the first born, she should have precedence in becoming kgosikgolo. Seboko had many critics because she was a woman. Her uncle Tumelo wanted Tsmiane Mokgosi, a cousin of Mosadi, to become kgosikgolo instead, and other members of the kgotla tried to delay her installation by saying that she did not have the skills to lead the traditional leopard hunt or to engage in the \\"rainmaking\\" ritual, both of which were necessary to prove a kgosikgolo's legitimacy. Mosadi rebutted the arguments, saying that many of those traditions fell into disuse when Christianity came to Botswana. Her ascension was revolutionary in that it overthrew a tradition where women were only allowed in the kgotla (village meeting) if they were invited by a male. She assumed office on 7 January 2002 and became chairperson of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi on 28 February 2002. She was crowned on 30 August 2003 and received the traditional gift of cattle, and a Toyota pickup truck, washing machine, vacuum cleaner, computer, and printer. During her coronation, she noted the changing dynamics of her tribe: Her leadership style is unconventional compared to her male predecessors: she openly talks about her abusive husband, sexual rights for women, and the growing HIV/AIDS problem. Critics have accused her of \\"defending women\\", but Mosadi Seboko responded that she is instead \\"angry at women [...] for failing to exert more control over their own circumstances\\".

The story centers on a boy who likes ‚Äúpretty things‚Äù and prefers to wear tiaras and ‚Äúgirly dresses.\\" The story informs readers about supporting children regardless of their expression. Despite the attention he receives regarding his appearance, the Princess Boy always has the love and support of his family throughout the entire story. While being controversial and frequently challenged, scholars advocate the book for its ability to introduce the idea of diversity in gender expression simply in homes, classrooms, counseling offices, and public libraries.  Plot  My Princess Boy begins with the narrator (and mother) introducing the Princess Boy and his many interests. The narrator describes the Princess Boy's family relationships and friendships. Next, the narrator expresses the conflict that arises with the Princess Boy's non-conforming gender identity and expression. In particular, the narrator recounts individuals laughing and staring at the Princess Boy when he wears or buys girly things. Throughout the entire story, the Princess Boy's family is steadfast in their reassurance, support, and love for the Princess Boy.  Background  The story was inspired by Kilodavis' son, Dyson. Kilodavis being a mother of a child who did not conform to stereotypical gender norms, wanted to advocate for the acceptance of gender differences. When her son Dyson was about two, he began creating his own personal style consisting of jewelry and dresses. Around this time was when Dyson proclaimed to her, \\"I am a Princess Boy, Mommy!\\" Kilodavis also admitted to a delayed acceptance towards her role as being a mother of a gender nonconforming child. Kilodavis initially imposed \\"boy\\" things onto her son while pushing him away from \\"girly\\" things. Finally, Kilodavis' older son, Dkobe, brought about a turning point: When Dkobe was six he asked his mother, \\"My can't you just let him be happy, Mom?\\" At this point, Kilodavis recognized that her older son's words would affect her and her family for good. Additionally, Kilodavis' inability to find empowering or positive books for her son Dyson also played an influential role in pushing her towards creating My Princess Boy. Kilodavis also mentioned that her upbringing played an extremely critical role in teaching her how to live spiritually, be self- aware, and sense what feels morally right from wrong. Kilodavis admitted that growing up, her socioeconomic and racial status made it harder for her to fit in as well. She too did not fit into the gender dichotomy of female stereotypes. Often, she was exploited when participating in male-dominated activities, due to her gender and race. She was further frustrated at the interplay between race and gender in society, and how she never saw examples of strong and powerful women in literature. Finally, Kilodavis stated that Free to Be‚Ä¶ You and Me by Marlo Thomas impacted her implicitly, as an author and mother, particularly with the book's themes of respect and acceptance. Furthermore, Kilodavis stated that Free to Be... You are Me helped set a foundation for her own book to be successfully received by adults who also felt different. Lastly, Kilodavis affirmed that she wrote the story as a tool to help people start a discussion on the acceptance of diversity.  Analysis  According to The Horn Book Guide to Children's and Young Adult Books, although Kilodavis, inspired by her son, admirably addresses gender identity in young children, she \\"doesn‚Äôt prevail over taboo due to her text‚Äôs oversimplification and didacticism.\\" Additionally, The Horn Book Guide to Children's and Young Adult Books contends that the \\"pink-heavy illustrations showing featureless characters are off-putting.\\" Alison Donnelly from The School Library Journal, on the other hand, maintains that Kilodavis, through her own experiences and the experiences of her son Dyson, is able to introduce themes such as identity, acceptance, individuality, and bullying. Donnelly claims that the book ultimately focuses around the themes of societal acceptance, unconditional love, and a unified family. Lastly, as asserted by Donnelly, My Princess Boy is also a call for tolerance, diversity, and the termination of judgment and bullying. DeSimone‚Äôs illustrations in My Princess Boy include featureless characters. Kilodavis, having worked with DeSimone in the past, asked her to create ‚Äúillustrations based on family photos.\\" Although featureless, the illustrations are positive, bright, and colorful. ‚ÄúIn the cartoon illustrations, stars pop into view and rise through pick skies as touches send balls bouncing cause flowers to emit rapid drumbeats and make the and the other weirdly faceless human figures dance. ‚ÄúChildren may ask why the people depicted have no faces which may spark discussions about how we are all the same.\\" In \\"Pedi-Files: Reading the Foot in Contemporary Illustrated Children's Literature,\\" Jennifer Miskec introduces the idea of boys being portrayed as feminized and \\"eroticized\\" while being en point. Miskec points out that the Princess Boy, throughout My Princess Boy, is portrayed en pointe. In one particular illustration, the Princess Boy is \\"on the tips of his pink shoes' toes, mirrored by his female playmate who is likewise en pointe in red shoes, directly and obviously showing his closer association with the female.\\" The Princess Boy's father, brother, and other male figures are depicted as standing flat-footed. Additionally, the Princess Boy's femininity is further articulated through \\"his blank face, without eyes, nose, or mouth, en pointe and silenced like classical ballerinas before him.\\" To Miskec, this translates as being the Princess Boy's fulfillment of his own feminine fantasy. Lastly, Kilodavis concludes with the statement ‚ÄúMy Princess Boy is your Princess Boy,‚Äù a sentiment suggesting that Kilodavis‚Äô intended audience is in large part for parents as well.  Publication  After communicating with Dyson's daycare, Kilodavis decided to write My Princess Boy as an avenue of expressing her support for her son. After contacting her illustrator, she distributed a locally copied, ‚Äúglue-bound‚Äù book to Dyson's teacher. After creating an online website to sell copies, an influx of book orders and support strained Kilodavis‚Äô ability to meet demands and produce a sufficient amount of the more expensive, locally copied books. Initially, Kilodavis hired a local book printer to produce and sell 100 books on Amazon, however, after the copy was introduced to Seattle's NBC affiliate and appeared on a daytime talk show, the floodgates opened. ‚ÄúWithin 24 hours there was a waiting list for the book, and I received more than 500 e-mails of support. It was an international response that was overwhelming.\\" After much media attention, Kilodavis ultimately connected with Simon & Schuster's children's division. When Kilodavis originally decided to publish through Amazon, she was fearful that they would change her storyline. ‚ÄúBack when I decided to put the book on Amazon, I knew I could submit it into a publisher, but I was so afraid they would change the story. Since this is nonfiction- and my tool- I couldn‚Äôt risk having anyone change it. At Simon & Schuster, they wanted to publish it as it was.\\" Simon & Schuster quickly closed the deal and published the book within two months. Reception Educators often utilize My Princess Boy for introducing topics and themes relating to gender. The utilization of My Princess Boy has opened outlets to exploring diverse experiences through literature, but has also conversely sparked much controversy across the United States. In 2014, fifty- two patrons in Granbury, Texas challenged the inclusion of the book in Hood County Library's collection. When the library's director, Courtney Kincaid, defended the book's inclusion, objectors took their complaint to the commissioners' court (a county legislative body in some U.S. states). The court effectively upheld Kincaid's decision by declining to vote on the matter. On October 12, 2015, the principal at Nova Classical Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota informed parents that the school would be supporting a student who was gender non-conforming. In an email, the principal asked for kindergarten parents to talk with their children about appropriate and respectful conduct when engaging with gender non-conforming identities. Upon learning that the non-conforming student was in kindergarten, many parents became concerned with the issue of gender identity being imposed onto their young children. Furthermore, several parents became increasingly apprehensive about the inclusion of My Princess Boy in the curriculum. The spectrum became prominently split with supporters launching petitions in favor of My Princess Boy and objectors either worried about bathroom policies, or leaving the Academy all together. There was a significant drop-off in applications and increase in declined offers of enrollment for the 2016‚Äì17 school year. The school later went on to replace My Princess Boy with poems depicting similar themes. In November 2019, many Loudoun County parents became outraged due to books placed in curriculums as a part of ‚Äúa new Diverse Classroom Library Initiative.\\" Several books, one being My Princess Boy, were assigned throughout the school district to introduce kids to a variety of cultures and races, yet many parents were alarmed with the influx of books centered on ‚Äúsexual diversity‚Äù and ‚ÄúLGBT ideology.\\" See also * Heather Has Two Mommies (1989) * Daddy's Roommate (1991) * 10,000 Dresses (2008) * Book censorship *Gay literature References Further reading * Category:2009 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Cross-dressing in literature Category:Novels with transgender themes ","title":"My Princess Boy"},{"id":"36707610","text":"Prototype is a 1983 made-for-television film, starring Christopher Plummer.https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b75d0e1f4 Plot summary Dr. Carl Forrester (Christopher Plummer), a curmudgeonly but basically kindly Nobel Prize-winning scientist, builds an equally kindly (but much handsomer, David Morse) $5 million dollar android named Michael.

Missouri Infantry Reunion, 1894 The 3rd Missouri US Reserve Corps Infantry Regiment evolved from one of several unofficial pro-Unionist militia units formed semi-secretly in St. Louis in the early months of 1861 by Congressman Francis Preston Blair, Jr. and other Unionist activists. The organization that would become the Third U.S.R.C was largely composed of ethnic Germans, who were generally opposed to slavery and strongly supportive of the Unionist cause. 20 percent of the men of the regiment were \\"native\\" U.S. citizens. Although initially without any official standing, beginning on April 22, 1861, the Unionist regiments Blair helped organize were sworn into Federal service at the St. Louis Arsenal by Captain John Schofield acting on the authority of President Lincoln. The first four regiments were considered to be the regiments of Missouri Volunteers called for under President Lincoln's April 15, 1861, call for 75,000 volunteers. So many St. Louis Unionists mustered to volunteer, that after consultation with General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron, President Lincoln directed Captain Nathaniel Lyon to \\"enroll in the military service of the United States the loyal citizens of Saint Louis and vicinity, not exceeding with those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand in number, for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the United States; [and] for the protection of the peaceable inhabitants of Missouri.\\"Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, Vol 3, Chapter VIII, p. 675 These additional regiments, in excess of the original Presidential call were designated \\"United States Reserve Corps\\" units, and were intended for local service.

President Lincoln would later confirm Lyon's promotion from captain to brigadier general.  Military Service  On May 10, 1861, the Third U.S.R.C under Colonel McNeil participated in the arrest of the Missouri Volunteer Militia drilling at Camp Jackson at Lindell Grove on the western border of St. Louis City, who were suspected of being involved in a Confederate plot to seize the federal arsenal in St. Louis. As the Missouri militiamen were being march under guard back to the arsenal near the riverfront, angry crowds confronted the Federal forces and the confused situation soon devolved into rioting and gunfire. Over 27 people were killed and the Camp Jackson Affair helped to polarize the state and send Missouri down the road to its own internal civil war. The 3rd U.S.R.C. served as part of the St. Louis garrison until July 1, 1861, when three of its companies joined Brigadier General Lyon's Southwest Expedition. On July 16, six additional companies marched on Callaway County, Missouri, where after a skirmish with members of the secessionist Missouri State Guard, they occupied Fulton. The regiment returned to St. Louis, where in September part of the unit's manpower was mustered out of service at the expiration of their enlistment. Those who chose to reenlist were reorganized as the 3rd Missouri, US Reserve Corps Infantry (Three Years Service), under the command of Colonel Charles A. Fritz, who had been the regiment's lieutenant colonel.

His 1955 dissertation on Proto-Mixtecan was the first extensive linguistic reconstruction in Mesoamerican languages. This was one of several SIL studies which helped to establish the Oto-Manguean language family as being comparable in time depth to Proto-Indo-European. His research on Trique was the first documented case of a language with five distinct levels of tone. He was Professor Emeritus at the University of Texas at Arlington, where he taught Linguistics for over 20 years (1972-1993), mostly on topics related to his approach to discourse analysis. In 1994-1995, he served as President of the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States (LACUS) and was honored by LACUS in 2007.http://www.sil.org/about/news/dr-robert-longacre-honored- lacus He was academically sharp and active till the end, working on a new book that came out just after his death: * 2014 (to appear).

Originally from East Perth, Lee made his senior WAFL debut in 2007 at age 19. By 2010, he was a regular senior player for the Royals, and he won the club's best and fairest award in 2011. After sixty games for the club and at age 24, he was recruited to the Australian Football League by with a late selection in the 2012 Rookie Draft (No. 78 overall). He played two senior games for Essendon during 2012, debuting in Round 20 against at Docklands Stadium, and played in the Victorian Football League for Essendon's Bendigo during the season. He was delisted at the end of the season, and returned to East Perth, where he won another club best and fairest in 2013 and became club captain. Lee, along with 33 other Essendon players, was found guilty of using a banned performance enhancing substance, thymosin beta-4, as part of Essendon's sports supplements program during the 2012 season. He and his team-mates were initially found not guilty in March 2015 by the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal, but a guilty verdict was returned in January 2016 after an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He was suspended for two years which, with backdating, ended in November 2016; as a result, he served approximately fourteen months of his suspension and missed the entire 2016 WAFL season.

Early life Reuben W. Carswell was born at \\"Middle Ground\\" Plantation near Louisville, Georgia on September 29, 1837.Allardice, Bruce S. More Generals in Gray. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1995. (pbk.). p. 52.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 166.Massey, R. J. Reuben W. Walker. In Northen, ed., William J. Men of Mark in Georgia. Volume 3. Atlanta: A.B. Caldwell, 1907-1912. . p. 417.Massey gives a date of birth for Carswell of September 26, 1828. Allardice says the 1837 date accords with Emory University records and with the 1850 and 1860 United States Census returns. His parents were Edward Rhodes Carswell, a State Representative in the Georgia General Assembly, and Mary Celesta (Walker) Carswell. Carswell was educated in his home county, Jefferson County, Georgia and at Emory University from which he graduated in the class of 1856.Massey says that Carswell graduated from Emory University in 1850 but Allardice says that Emory University records show that he graduated in 1856. He then studied law under future Confederate Major General (temporary) Ambrose R. Wright. After being admitted to the bar, he practiced law with his cousin, William Carswell. Reuben Carswell served as a Georgia state representative in 1858-1860.Massey says Carswell was re-elected in 1860. Allardice simply says he served until 1860. In 1861, Carswell married a daughter of James Walker.Massey does not give Miss Walker's first name. They had four children: Edgar R., Reuben W., Margaret and Isabel. American Civil War service Reuben W. Carswell started his Civil War service on June 14, 1861 as a second lieutenant in the 20th Georgia Infantry Regiment.Eicher, 2001, p. 166 says that Carswell was a brigadier general in the Provisional Army of Virginia between April 27, 1861 and June 8, 1861. This is dubious because of the nature of that organization as essentially an enlarged state militia and the circumstances at the beginning of the Civil War. Such a position for Carswell is not mentioned by Allardice or Massey.Eicher, 2001, p. 166 says Carswell was promoted to first lieutenant of the 20th Georgia Infantry on March 7, 1862 and resigned the next day. His appointment in the 48th Georgia Infantry followed. He was appointed captain in the 48th Georgia Infantry Regiment in March 1862. On March 22, 1862, Carswell was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 48th Georgia Infantry. The 48th Georgia Infantry Regiment was in a brigade commanded by then Brigadier General Ambrose Wright, Carswell's mentor as a lawyer. Carswell performed with distinction during the Seven Days Battles and at the Battle of Chancellorsville. After being elected a state representative to the Georgia State Legislature in 1863, Carswell returned to Georgia to serve in that office.Eicher, 2001, p. 166 states that Carswell did not resign his Confederate States Army commission as a lieutenant colonel until November 12, 1864. This is supported by the web site Cobbs Legion web site which also states that Major Matthew Robert Hall succeeded Carswell as lieutenant colonel on December 24, 1863. The site states that Hall later became colonel of the regiment on January 19, 1865, to rank from November 12, 1864. The colonel of the regiment, William Gibson, who had been captured at the Battle of Gettysburg and later exchanged, had also resigned on that date. On the other hand, a June 19, 1933 letter from the Adjutant General of the United States states that Carswell resigned as lieutenant colonel of the regiment on December 13, 1863 and that in addition to his election to the state legislature, he was in ill health. Adjutant General Letter. Retrieved August 13, 2012. As the Union Army under Major General William T. Sherman began to advance in Georgia in May 1864, Georgia Governor Joseph E. Brown appointed Carswell a brigadier general in the Georgia militia. Carswell led the 1st Brigade of the Georgia militia in opposition to the Union Army under Sherman during the Atlanta Campaign and Sherman's March to the Sea. The brigade fought at the Battle of Ruff's Station, now Smyrna, Georgia on July 4, 1864, the Battle of Atlanta on July 22, 1864 and during the subsequent siege of Atlanta until the fall of the city on September 2, 1864. Governor Brown furloughed the militia for 30 days so the men could harvest their crops. The men returned in October and skirmished with Sherman's men along their march to Savannah, Georgia. Carswell's brigade set out early from Macon, Georgia and missed the Battle of Griswoldville, in which Sherman's forces decimated the other brigades of Georgia militia that attacked a Union brigade at Griswoldville, near Macon. Carswell commanded his brigade at Savannah in December 1864 until the city fell to the Union force. As Sherman took his men to South Carolina, the Georgia militia remained in its home state. Carswell surrendered to the Union Army on May 20, 1865, at Augusta, Georgia. He was paroled as a brigadier general of Georgia militia. Later life Carswell returned to his law practice after the war. He was elected judge of the Superior Courts of the Middle Circuit of Georgia in 1880.Allardice, 1995, p. 52-53. Ill health forced him to resign six years later.Allaridce, 1995, p. 53. Reuben Walker Carswell died at his home in Louisville, Georgia, on January 11, 1889. He is buried at New Cemetery in Louisville, Georgia.
