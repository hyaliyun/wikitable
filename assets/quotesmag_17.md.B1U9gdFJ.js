Description Condorcet's Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the Idea of Progress a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's \\"present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind\\"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences \\"no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions\\"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature. Condorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French Enlightenment, particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding through 10 epochs (stages). None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The enlightenment of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly utopian society. However, he stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender.Williams, David (2004). Condorcet and Modernity. Cambridge University Press. .

Their early musical style has been inspired by post-rock and early screamo acts, and they are a part of a post-hardcore music movement also represented by Touché Amoré, La Dispute, Defeater, and Make Do and Mend. The group reissued their well-received debut album Old Pride in 2010 through Topshelf Records.  History  = Early years and Old Pride (2006–2010) = Pianos Become The Teeth formed in late 2006 in Baltimore, Maryland. Their first release, the Saltwater EP, was released in 2008 through Doomed by Dawn Records. In early 2009 Pianos Become The Teeth released a split EP with Ezra Joyce. Their contributed track, \\"Creatures of Habit,\\" was a darker song similar to the material that was recorded for their follow-up first full- length. Pianos Become The Teeth released their debut album, Old Pride in 2009 through Blackjaw Records. They subsequently signed to Topshelf Recordings in October 2009, and reissued their debut album in January 2010 through digital media outlets and on CD. The Topshelf version of Old Pride saw a much wider release that was met with much acclaim. Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound gave the album a nine out of ten, and wrote that \\"With a why-just-write-a-song-when- you-can-write-an-epic attitude, the eight songs on their second record are distinguished, articulate and immersive as their juddering post-hardcore clashes with moments of Explosions in the Sky rivalling tenderness and Mogwai- esque grandeur.\\" Writing for Alternative Press, Brian Shultz gave the album four out of five stars and said that the group has, \\"quietly refined their craft over the last few years into an incredibly cathartic and sporadically chilling mode. Their screamo peers--past or present--should be more than envious.\\" Old Pride was released on vinyl in June 2010 as a joint release through Topshelf Records and Mayfly Records. In support of the album, Pianos Become The Teeth toured the US with Touché Amoré and Lemuria. In October 2010, Pianos Become The Teeth released a split EP with the Saddest Landscape through Just Say No! Records. = The Lack Long After (2011–2013) = In January 2011, the Pianos Become The Teeth had begun writing a new album, and described the new songs as being \\"darker and heavier\\" than previous material, and that they would not become \\"Old Pride part 2,\\" alluding to new musical direction. Recording began on August 1, 2011 at Developing Nations Studio with producer Kevin Bernsten. In October and November, the group supported Title Fight on their headlining US tour. Topshelf Records released the LP The Lack Long After, a concept album about vocalist Kyle Durfey's father's death from multiple sclerosis, on November 1, 2011, with a supporting tour with Touché Amoré and Seahaven following shortly after. Pianos Become the Teeth, in 2013, also released a split EP with friends Touché Amoré. Pianos' song \\"Hiding\\" was noted for its stylistic change from The Lack Long After which hinted toward their change which became apparent on Keep You released in late 2014. = Signing to Epitaph and Keep You (2014) = Pianos Become the Teeth signed with Epitaph Records in 2014, and released their third studio album, Keep You, on October 28 of that year. The Will Yip-produced album is noted for its stylistic departure from earlier releases, featuring a less aggressive sound and no screamed vocals from Kyle Durfey. The band promoted the album with an online stream of \\"Repine\\" in August 2014. = Wait for Love (2018) = On November 8, 2017 Pianos Become the Teeth announced that their new album would release on February 16, 2018.

After the album's release, Pianos Become The Teeth announced an August 2018 UK co- headline tour with Foxing to celebrate the release and coincide with their appearance at ArcTanGent festival.

Other figures in The Wave include La Dispute, Touché Amoré, Defeater and Make Do and Mend. The bands in this movement perform with \\"emotionally-centered lyrical content, dual musical emphasis on both melody and distorted intensity.\\" Musically, Pianos Become The Teeth write songs influenced by early screamo acts such as Envy, City of Caterpillar and Funeral Diner, and also post-rock bands like This Will Destroy You. In an interview with Staircase Thoughts, the band described being labeled as screamo as \\"flattering in some respects,\\" but ultimately didn't want to be pigeonholed as a \\"screamo band.\\" Vocalist Kyle Durfey writes very personal lyrics that often discuss events in his life, or about dwelling on the future and growing up. Specifically on their album Old Pride, Durfey wrote about, \\"how you have this 'young fire' when you're younger and you have to have an 'old pride' to feel right about your life.\\" The track \\"Cripples Can't Shiver\\" outlines Durfey's father, and how his struggles with multiple sclerosis impacted his life. In an interview with Hearwax, Kyle Durfey commented on writing dark lyrics, stating \\"I feel like most of us and most bands we are into tend to write about darker things.

Signs and symptoms Solid pseudopapillary tumours are often asymptomatic and are identified incidentally on imaging performed for unrelated reasons. Less often, they may cause abdominal pain. Solid pseudopapillary tumours tend to occur in women, and most often present in the third decade of life. Anatomy =Gross morphology= Solid pseudopapillary tumours are typically round, well-demarcated, measuring 2–17 cm in diameter (average 8 cm), with solid and cystic areas with hemorrhage on cut sections. =Histomorphology= Solid pseudopapillary tumours consist of solid sheets of cells that are focally dyscohesive. The cells in the lesion usually have uniform nuclei with occasional nuclear grooves, eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm and PAS positive eosinophilic intracytoplasmic globules. Necrosis is usually present and, as cell death preferentially occurs distant from blood vessels, lead to the formation of pseudopapillae. =Immunohistochemistry= Solid pseudopapillary tumours show positive nuclear staining for beta catenin, as well as positive immunostaining for CD10, CD56, vimentin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and neuron specific enolase; they are negative for chromogranin and pancreatic enzymes. Diagnosis The diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas is usually confirmed with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion. Management In most cases, solid pseudopapillary tumours should be resected surgically, as there is a risk of malignancy (cancer).

His birth name was David Lloyd Wilkie, although he went by many others, including \\"Rev. Les Ego\\". Early life Born in Independence, Missouri, to Richard and Juanita Wilkie as the middle child of seven, his father was a machinist, carpenter and blacksmith while Juanita was a seamstress, gardener and bookkeeper. In 1945, Richard was trying to put out a fire when he was electrocuted and died. Adam served in the U.S. Army and graduated with a master's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. He taught at high schools and junior colleges in California and South Dakota. Making his way east, he was a reporter for The York Gazette and Daily in York, Pennsylvania, eventually ending up in New York City in 1968. The Garden of Eden Purple's \\"Garden of Eden\\", built by him single-handedly over five years starting in 1975, was a well-known open, community garden on Forsyth Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The garden began when the city and the neighborhood were blighted with urban decay. A building was razed in 1973 on Eldridge Street behind Purple’s apartment, and he decided to plant something with his companion, Eve. The process of clearing the lot took some time since the couple would only use hand tools. Modern machinery was considered \\"counter-revolutionary.\\" He would haul manure from the horse-drawn carriages around Central Park and created a highly fertile topsoil. The garden was ready to be planted in the spring of 1975. The garden was designed around concentric circles with a yin-yang symbol in the center. As buildings were torn down on either side, Purple would add new rings to the garden, allowing it to grow. By the end, it was 15,000 square feet featuring a wide range of produce, including corn, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, black raspberries, strawberries, and 45 trees including eight black walnuts. He regularly bicycled to Central Park to collect horse manure to use as fertilizer.Adam Purple, 22 November 2006, interviewed by Amy Brost, \\"Adam Purple and the Garden of Eden\\", Harvey Wang & Amy Brost, 2011 Family and move to Australia He had at least four biological children and two stepchildren. By his first wife, Ann, he had two daughters, Jenean and Lenore. His second wife, Romola, had two daughters, Dorothy and Diane. A later partner, known as \\"Eve\\", gave birth to a girl, Nova Dawn. He also had a son by a later partner, according to accounts of his life published in two parts in The Villager (NYC) in January 2016, which contain quotes from the eldest four girls about their lives with Purple, and his sexual abuse of all of them in Australia. In 1964, Wilkie and his wife, Romola, and their \\"blended family\\" of four girls emigrated to Australia, by boat. They traveled on the Orsova, docking in New South Wales after a three-month voyage. Wilkie worked as a teacher of English and literature. The family lived in Kurrajong Heights, near Sydney. Wilkie was convicted of child molestation and deported in the late 1960s or early 1970s, winding up in the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, California. New York City In the early 1980s, the city planned to create low-income housing, but there was opposition from neighborhood activists and supporters. The Storefront for Art and Architecture created a group exhibition in 1984 to present alternative designs that would encompass the Garden of Eden into the public housing initiative. The initiative was unsuccessful. In 1985, Judge Vincent L. Broderick of Federal District Court ruled that the demolition could take place. The garden was demolished on January 8, 1986.Joyce Mendelsohn, The Lower East Side Remembered, Columbia University Press, 2009, pp. xii, 178-79Sharon Zukin, Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Places, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 202Sandor Ellix Katz, The revolution will not be microwaved, Chelsea Green Publishing, 2006, p. 108 Its destruction took just 75 minutes under the large rubber tires of a scoop-equipped highway construction vehicle. After Purple's \\"Garden of Eden\\" was destroyed, his friend, artist George Bliss, painted trails of purple footprints around the Lower East Side leading to the garden's former location. He is one of fifty subjects featured in Harvey Wang's New York, a book of photographs and brief biographies of notable or colorful New Yorkers.Harvey Wang's New York, Norton, 1990, pp. 94-95. He was interviewed by Amy Brost in 2006 for StoryCorps and, with the help of Harvey Wang, created a short film. Death Purple died on September 14, 2015, from a heart attack, aged 84, while bicycling across the Williamsburg Bridge. \\"Mr. Purple\\" Controversy Mr. Purple, a rooftop bar in the Lower East Side’s Hotel Indigo, cites the activist as the inspiration for its name. The bar, an upscale haunt located on the hotel’s 15th floor, boasts expansive skyline views and a high-end, chic atmosphere coupled with an equally high-end menu. In the 14th floor lobby, a mural by former Fun Gallery artist Lee Quiñones features a snapshot of Adam Purple, as well as other pictures capturing the Lower East Side’s formerly thriving punk-beat art and music scene. The bar’s opening in 2015 has sparked outrage among the late activist’s friends and followers, who say that the restaurant represents a contradiction to almost everything that the real Mr. Purple believed in and fought for. The aforementioned photographer Harvey Wang, whose snapshot of Purple was featured in the mural without his permission, said, “the hotel owners seem to be profiting from Adam’s legacy without giving back. I would like to see them apologize[…]If they understood anything at all about what Adam stood for, they would grow and distribute free food, open their doors to the homeless, give away all profits, and generate no waste.” Perhaps the most directly insulting to the activist is the inclusion of the “Mr. Purple Burger” on the bar’s menu, despite the fact that the actual Mr. Purple was a vegan.

Description One of Edmonton's major hotels located in Downtown Edmonton, the Chateau Lacombe was first opened on 28 December 1966 by the Canadian Pacific Hotels Corporation. It features 307 rooms in the 24-storey cylindrical tower topped by Edmonton's only revolving restaurant, La Ronde, which offers sweeping views of both the city's downtown core and the North Saskatchewan river valley below as it makes a full rotation every 90 minutes. Canadian Pacific Hotels bought Canadian National Hotels, which owned and operated the nearby historic Hotel Macdonald. After CP Hotels and Resorts purchased Fairmont Hotels, the newer Chateau Lacombe was sold to investors and it was rebranded the Crowne Plaza Chateau Lacombe. It was sold again in mid-2010 for $47.8m to local company Hargate Properties who retained the affiliation with Crowne Plaza Hotels but the new owners went into receivership in November 2011. The purchase of the hotel by Kevyn Frederick in 2010 later was discovered to be part of a large mortgage fraud in the Edmonton area. The hotel was bought out of receivership by the new ownership group for $27.5m in 2012, and in May 2013 the hotel was relaunched as an independent hotel.

Located in Grafton Gully, northeast of Grafton Bridge, roughly between the northern part of Whitaker Place and the Auckland Bowls Club in Grafton Mews, it was razed in the mid-1960s, and its site is now occupied by on- and off-ramps to the Auckland Central Motorway Junction. The ground hosted a considerable number of notable football matches, including several international fixtures and many of the Auckland regional finals and national semi-finals of the Chatham Cup. Originally owned by Morgan Blandford (for whom it is named), the park was in existence at least as early as 1913. In 1923, Blandford leased the park to the Auckland Football Association for a period of 30 years, with an option to buy outright after that point. The park was unappealing at the time, with contemporary reports noting that it was swampy and seemed to be a general dumping ground. Over the course of the next two years, the AFA attempted to transform the park, clearing the land and adding terraces which could accommodate several thousand spectators. The park had easy access from Grafton Bridge and was handy to most of the city's main tram lines. The ground was officially opened in mid 1925. The marshiness of the ground was, however, still a major problem, and could not be easily remedied. The ground was located in a low-lying basin with considerable run- off from the surrounding hills. The situation was not helped by the AFA's decision to offer a 30-year sub-lease of the ground during football's off- season to another group, the Stadium Company. This group began to run cycling competitions at the ground, adding to the disrepair of the surface. Despite legal wrangles between the AFA and the Stadium Company, in which the AFA tried to terminate the sub-lease, the ground deterioration continued, with cycling, and later speedway still being run at the park. Other sports played at the park included softball, and the ground was the home of the Grafton Cricket Club. During the late 1940s, the AFA tried to negotiate with the Auckland City Council for the purchase of the park after the AFA lease expired. The council considered the offer but found that there were numerous problems: the ground was of an unsuitable size for most public sporting uses, its drainage problems still persisted, and - with the increase in private motor vehicle use - its lack of parking space was considered a distinct disadvantage. It was also noted at the time that the whole of the Grafton Gully area was likely to be needed for motorway use at some point in the not-too-distant future. In the end a compromise was reached, with the Auckland City Council acquiring the lease on the park and sub-letting it to the AFA. After a legal wrangle with the park's owners, the park became council property in 1953, earmarked for roading purposes. The AFA continued to use the ground as its headquarters until 1964, when it moved to Newmarket Park. With the building of the motorway the park initially became a dumping ground for quarried spoil before being buried beneath part of the motorway itself.

Students are divided into Early Education (EE2-1st), Lower School (2nd-5th), and Upper School (6th-12th). History Southside Christian School was one of five all white private schools that were established in Greenville County between 1966 and 1970 when Greenville public schools were being desegregated. Southside Christian School officials, however, have denied that school was established to facilitate racially segregated education. In 1978, Southside Christian School administrator Ron Brooks spoke at a conference organized by opponents of an IRS regulation that would revoke the tax exemptions of private schools that had significantly different racial composition than the surrounding community. Brooks said that it was \\"wrong for the government to get involved in our church\\" and claimed that the school did not \\"keep track of students by race\\". Brooks argued that since Southside Christian School was formed before the final court order desegregating Greenville schools, the school was not a discriminatory institution. In 2002, Southside Christian School received inquiries from parents seeking to withdraw their children from public schools after a racially charged debate on school assignment zone changes.

In this study, a child was offered a choice between one small but immediate reward, or two small rewards if they waited for a period of time. During this time, the researcher left the room for about 15 minutes and then returned. The reward was either a marshmallow or pretzel stick, depending on the child's preference. In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and other life measures. A replication attempt with a sample from a more diverse population, over 10 times larger than the original study, showed only half the effect of the original study. The replication suggested that economic background, rather than willpower, explained the other half. Origins = Original Stanford experiment = The first experiment in delayed gratification was conducted by Walter Mischel and Ebbe B. Ebbesen at Stanford University in 1970. = Purpose = The purpose of the study was to understand when the control of delayed gratification, the ability to wait to obtain something that one wants, develops in children. Most of the research conducted during that time was done with delayed rewards in areas such as time perspective and the delay of rewards, resistance to temptation, and psychological disturbances. Not many studies had been conducted in the area of human social behavior. The authors hypothesized that an increased salience of a reward would in turn increase the amount of time children would be able to delay gratification (or wait). Since the rewards were presented in front of them, children were reminded of why they were waiting. The attention on the reward (that was right in front of them) was supposed to make them wait longer (for the larger reward). This first experiment took place at Stanford University in 1970. The participants were 32 children. The children were led into a room, empty of distractions, where a treat of their choice (either two animal cookies or five pretzel sticks) were placed on a table. The researchers let the children know they could eat the treat, but if they waited 15 minutes without giving in to the temptation, they would be rewarded with a second treat. Mischel and Ebbesen observed, \\"(some children) covered their eyes with their hands, rested their heads on their arms, and found other similar techniques for averting their eyes from the reward objects. Many seemed to try to reduce the frustration of delay of reward by generating their own diversions: they talked to themselves, sang, invented games with their hands and feet, and even tried to fall asleep while waiting - as one successfully did.\\" Participants  There were 32 children who were used as participants in this experiment, 16 boys and 16 girls. The participants attended the Bing Nursery School of Stanford University. The children ranged in age from three years and six months, to five years and eight months. The median age was four years and six months. Three subjects were eliminated because they failed to comprehend the instructions given by the experimenters. Procedures The procedures were conducted by two male experimenters. There was an opaque cake tin presented on a table in the experimental room. Under the cake tin, there were five pretzels and two animal cookies. There were two chairs in front of the table; on one chair was an empty cardboard box. Near the chair with the empty cardboard box, there were four battery operated toys on the floor. The experimenter pointed out the four toys before the child could play with the toys. The experimenter asked the child to sit in the chair and then demonstrated each toy briefly, and in a friendly manner said they would play with the toys later on. Then the experimenter placed each toy in the cardboard box and out of sight of the child. The experimenter explained to the child that he needed to leave the room, and if the child ate the pretzel, the experimenter would return to the room. These instructions were repeated until the child seemed to understand them completely. The experimenter left the room and waited for the child to eat the pretzel – they repeated this procedure four times. Then the experimenter returned to the experimental room and opened the cake tin to reveal two sets of rewards (in the form of edibles): five pretzels and two animal crackers. The experimenter asked the child which of the two they preferred. Once the child chose, the experimenter explained that the child could either continue to wait for the more preferred reward until the experimenter returned, or the child could stop waiting by bringing back the experimenter. If the child stopped waiting then the child would receive the less preferred reward and forgo the more preferred one. Depending on the condition and the child's choice of preferred reward, the experimenter picked up the cake tin and along with it either nothing, one of the rewards, or both. The experimenter returned either as soon as the child signaled him to do so or after 15 minutes. Results The results indicated the exact opposite of what was originally predicted. Instead of the rewards serving as a cue to attend to possible delayed rewards, the rewards themselves served to increase the children's frustration and ultimately decreased the delay of gratification. The results seemed to indicate that not thinking about a reward enhances the ability to delay gratification, rather than focusing attention on the future reward.  Stanford marshmallow experiment  Purpose The following study, conducted by Mischel, Ebbesen, and Zeiss (1972), is generally recognized as the Stanford marshmallow experiment due to its use of marshmallows as a preferred reward item. Building on information obtained in previous research regarding self-control, Mischel et al. hypothesized that any activity that distracts a participant from the reward they are anticipating will increase the time of delay gratification. It was expected that overt activities, internal cognitions, and fantasies would help in this self- distraction. Through such distraction it was also hypothesized that the subject would be able to take the frustrative nature of the situation and convert it into one psychologically less aversive. To test their expectations, the researchers contrived three settings under which to test participants; an overt activity, a covert activity, or no activity at all. They predicted that under the overt and covert activities that delay of gratification should increase, while under the no activity setting it would decrease. To assess the children’s ability to understand the instructions they were given, the experiment asked them three comprehension questions; “Can you tell me, which do you get to eat if you wait for me to come back by myself?”, “But if you want to, how can you make me come back ?”, and “If you ring the bell and bring me back, then which do you get?” Three distinct experiments were conducted under multiple differing conditions. Experiment 1 participants The participants consisted of 50 children (25 boys and 25 girls) from the Bing Nursery School at Stanford University. They ranged in age from 3 years 6 months to 5 years 6 months. The mean age was 4 years 6 months. Six subjects were eliminated because they failed to comprehend the instructions given by the experimenters. Experiment 1 procedures The procedures were conducted by one male and one female experimenter. During the test conditions the male experimenter conducted his session with 3 male and 2 female participants, while the female experimenter conducted her session with 3 female and 2 male participants. The small room where the tests were conducted contained a table equipped with a barrier between the experimenter and the child. On the table, behind the barrier, was slinky toy along with an opaque cake tin that held a small marshmallow and pretzel stick. Next to the table equipped with the barrier there was another table that contained a box of battery and hand- operated toys, which were visible to the child. Against one wall of the small room there was a chair, another table, and a desk bell. In Experiment 1 the children were tested under the conditions of (1) waiting for delayed reward with an external distractor (toy), (2) waiting for delayed reward with an internal distractor (ideation), (3) waiting for a delayed reward (no distractor), (4) external distractor (toy) without delay-of-reward waiting contingency, and (5) internal distractor (ideation) without delay of reward contingency. Experiment 2 participants The participants consisted of 32 children from the Bing Nursery School of Stanford University. They ranged in age from 3 years 9 months to 5 years 3 months. The mean age was 4 years and 9 months. Six of the subjects were eliminated from the study because they failed to comprehend the instructions or because they ate one of the reward objects while waiting for the experimenter. Experiment 2 procedures Experiment 2 focused on how the substantive content of cognitions can affect subsequent delay behavior. The conditions in Experiment 2 were the same as in Experiment 1, with the exception that after the three comprehension questions were asked of the children the experimenter suggested ideas to think about while they were waiting. These suggestions are referred to as “think food rewards” instructions in the study. They were intended to induce in the subject various types of ideation during the delay-of-gratification period. Experiment 3 participants The participants consisted of 16 children (11 boys and 5 girls). They ranged in age from 3 years 5 months to 5 years 6 months. The mean age was 4 years 6 months. Experiment 3 procedures In Experiment 3 all of the conditions and procedures were the same as in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, except that the reward items were not visible to the children while they waited. In the previous experiments both of the reward objects were directly available to the children while they waited in the delay period. To achieve this change in condition the children were told that the food items needed to be kept fresh. The marshmallow and pretzel stick were then placed under the opaque cake tin and put under the table out of sight of the child. In this experiment the same “think food rewards” were given to the children as in Experiment 2. Overall results The three separate experiments demonstrate a number of significant findings. Effective delay of gratification depends heavily on the cognitive avoidance or suppression of the reward objects while waiting for them to be delivered. Additionally, when the children thought about the absent rewards, it was just as difficult to delay gratification as when the reward items were directly in front of them. Conversely, when the children in the experiment waited for the reward and it was not visibly present, they were able to wait longer and attain the preferred reward. The Stanford marshmallow experiment is important because it demonstrated that effective delay is not achieved by merely thinking about something other than what we want, but rather, it depends on suppressive and avoidance mechanisms that reduce frustration. The frustration of waiting for a desired reward is demonstrated nicely by the authors when describing the behavior of the children. “They made up quiet songs…hid their head in their arms, pounded the floor with their feet, fiddled playfully and teasingly with the signal bell, verbalized the contingency…prayed to the ceiling, and so on. In one dramatically effective self-distraction technique, after obviously experiencing much agitation, a little girl rested her head, sat limply, relaxed herself, and proceeded to fall sound asleep.” Follow-up studies In follow-up studies, Mischel found unexpected correlations between the results of the marshmallow experiment and the success of the children many years later. The first follow-up study, in 1988, showed that \\"preschool children who delayed gratification longer in the self-imposed delay paradigm, were described more than 10 years later by their parents as adolescents who were significantly more competent.\\" A second follow-up study, in 1990, showed that the ability to delay gratification also correlated with higher SAT scores. A 2006 paper to which Mischel contributed reports a similar experiment, this time relating ability to delay in order to receive a cookie (at age 4) and reaction time on a go/no go task. A 2011 brain imaging study of a sample from the original Stanford participants when they reached mid-life showed key differences between those with high delay times and those with low delay times in two areas: the prefrontal cortex (more active in high delayers) and the ventral striatum, (more active in low delayers) when they were trying to control their responses to alluring temptations. A 2012 study at the University of Rochester (with a smaller N= 28) altered the experiment by dividing children into two groups: one group was given a broken promise before the marshmallow test was conducted (the unreliable tester group), and the second group had a fulfilled promise before their marshmallow test (the reliable tester group). The reliable tester group waited up to four times longer (12 min) than the unreliable tester group for the second marshmallow to appear. The authors argue that this calls into question the original interpretation of self-control as the critical factor in children's performance, since self-control should predict ability to wait, not strategic waiting when it makes sense. Prior to the marshmallow experiment at Stanford, Walter Mischel had shown that the child's belief that the promised delayed rewards would actually be delivered is an important determinant of the choice to delay, but his later experiments did not take this factor into account or control for individual variation in beliefs about reliability when reporting correlations with life successes. In the studies Mischel and colleagues conducted at Stanford University, in order to establish trust that the experimenter would return, at the beginning of the \\"marshmallow test\\" children first engaged in a game in which they summoned the experimenter back by ringing a bell; the actual waiting portion of the experiment did not start until after the children clearly understood that the experimenter would keep the promise. Participants of the original studies at the Bing School at Stanford University appeared to have no doubt that they would receive a reward after waiting and chose to wait for the more desirable reward. However, Mischel's earlier studies showed there are many other situations in which children cannot be certain that they would receive the delayed outcome. In such situations, waiting for delayed rewards may not be an adaptive response. Watts, Duncan and Quan's 2018 conceptual replication yielded mostly statistically insignificant correlations with behavioral problems but a significant correlation with achievement tests at age 15. These effects were lower than in the original experiment and reduced further when controlling for early cognitive ability and behavior, family background, and home environment. A 2020 study at University of Carolina showed that a reputation plays significant role in the experiment.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. With . Standing at 7 floors it is the 5th tallest building in Missoula. It is located at 111 North Higgins Avenue. Since its original construction in 1888, The Florence Hotel offered weary railway travelers and settlers a comfortable night's lodging. When it burned in 1913, The Florence was rebuilt as a major 106-room hostelry and was a longtime regional gathering place until it, too, was destroyed by fire in 1936. Missoula's lack of a major hotel had serious implications, and even though the nation was then in the midst of the Great Depression, Walter H. McLeod and other influential businessmen secured community support to rebuild. Constructed in 1941 on the same site as the two earlier buildings, today's Florence was brought to life by Spokane, Washington architect G.A. Pehrson who masterfully designed the $600,000 “jewel of a hotel” in its current Art Moderne style. For the next three decades the Florence continued to welcome visitors to downtown Missoula and Big Sky Country. In fact, “Howdy” met Hollywood when John Wayne famously slumbered at The Florence—adding to the romantic notion of the Wild West mingling with the opulent splendor of the hotel's signature style. The Florence was ahead of its time with the Northwest's first central air conditioning system, novel glass shower doors, underground parking for the growing number of Americans traveling by automobile, and first-class interior appointments in a “harmony of color.” The Florence remained a hotel until the 1970s when the building was transformed once again—this time into an office complex with retail businesses occupying the main floor.

It was developed and published by Human Entertainment, and was released in Japan and South Korea in 1994. Gameplay Title screen the gameplay. Taekwon-Do is based on real Taekwondo, using real attacks/techniques and tournament rules. All in all there are 19 different fighters who all have their own stats and special moves, and players can also make their own customized fighter/character with unique abilities, etc. The fighting control is very simple with the standardized attack buttons and direction button attack button combinations. There are four different game modes: tournament, versus, tag battle by turns and practice. Before start the game, the player can choose from two languages: Japanese or Korean. There is no movement list, and no specials or hidden moves for all the vast majority of fighters. Unlike most fighting games, the player does not need to memorize the special/super move sets every time when different characters are chosen from time to time. The varieties of attacks for all characters in Taekwon-Do only lies in the four buttons of X, Y, B, and A, with a different start up. If the player pushes the directional buttons, each character will have eight different moves that the player can combine throughout the fight. The match itself can either end in five rounds like a common taekwondo competition (at the time the game was released), or if the opponent is knocked out cold before the 5th round. Characters Lee: 25 years old, he is the representative from the Kansai region. He is a Taekwondo Dojang owner and his hobbies include going to the Cinema and the aquarium, in addition to teaching children at the Town Hall. He is rumoured to be the closest fighter to becoming the next Olympic representative. He is an \\"All around\\" type character, meaning he is well-balanced and has no glaring shortcomings. He wears a standard White and Black Taekwondo Dobok, hair that is depicted in booklets as black but is brown in-game, and a white bandana tied around his head. He is the only character to be depicted wearing his dobok in the instruction booklet, showing his commitment to the art. He is also the game's \\"Master\\" or trainer in the in-game tutorials. Shun: 20 years old, he is a college student hailing from the Kanto region. His hobbies include playing tennis and skying. Considered a genius talent and an Ace in Taekwondo and famous as a fighter since he was very young, he nonetheless appears to have had an accident, causing him to undergo medical treatment, which in turn has made him anxious about his ability to perform. This is reflected in the game, as his stats are all very high, except for his stamina, which is the lowest among all fighters. He is present in every screenshot of the game found in the booklet as Lee's opponent, perhaps hinting at a rivalry between them. He wears a Green and Black uniform and has slick, red-brown hair with bangs. He is depicted with a turtleneck sweater covered with a shirt and a jacket in the booklet. Like Lee, he is an \\"All around\\" type character, meaning he has no weaknesses, however, his stamina is abysmally low. This could be a blessing in hiding though, as becoming rapidly exhausted gives Shun the ability to use his super technique more often than any other fighter. Kai: 23 years old, he represents the Koshinetsu area. He works at a gym and his hobby is body building. He is a hot-blooded up-and-coming Taekwondo star who has emphasized the power-building aspect of his training, honing his body every day. As such, he is the physically strongest character and has a sizable pool of stamina. He uses his power to make up for his lower speed and technique stats, meaning his attacks can be slow, but devastating. He's fairly distinctive, wearing a Red and Black Taekwondo dobok and matching bandana around his head, with brown hair in-game, although he is depicted as black- haired in the booklet, where he's also shown wearing sports apparel and lifting weights. He is the game's first \\"Power\\" type character and as such, hits harder than other fighters, being capable of landing a Knockout or a Critical Blow at any moment, although he has other shortcomings to compensate. Sho: 18 years old, he represents the Northeast area and is still a high school student. He enjoys any lively activity as a hobby, and is very laid-back, known for loitering around. However, he has a keen interest in music, and would like to become a musician after retiring from sports, secretly hoping he could be a singer. Sho wears a Yellow and Black Taekwondo dobok and wears a distinctive pony tail. In-game his hair is light brown, but the booklet illustration depicts him as auburn-haired. In the game's artwork he is depicted as smoking, and wearing a leather jacket, jeans, sunglasses and dog- tags, showcasing his laid-back personality and perhaps hinting at a back story involving the military. He is known for using a lot of flashy and conspicuous, attention-grabbing techniques, as such he is a \\"Jump\\" type character. Jump fighters are known for having superior stability and have good jumping attacks. Most of his normal techniques are also aerial kicks. Yagami: 20 years old, he represents the China and Shikoku region, and at present is a school student. His hobby is playing the Chinese board game Mahjong, which he is very passionate about. His great wish was to be accepted into a certain University, and cheerfully notes \\"I passed the test!\\". Yagami wears an Orange and Black Taekwondo dobok and fashions his brown hair into bangs falling to the sides of his face. In the booklet he is depicted as red-haired, carrying his school backpack and sporting a laid-back outfit. Yagami is a \\"Skill\\" type character and as such has a decent variety of moves and a good string attack. Ichijyo: At 26 years old, he is the oldest of the main characters. He hails from the Hokuriku region and works as a bank clerk, although his hobby is computer programming. Ichijyo likes to plan ahead and considers power to come from stability. He is happy being safe and secure even if some think of him as plain. He plays a strategic match. Like Lee, he sports a White and Black Taekwondo dobok, and is brown haired. In the booklet artwork, he is depicted as blue-eyed, wearing glasses and sporting a business suit whilst speaking on a cell phone. Ichijyo is an \\"All around\\" type character and as such has no glaring shortcomings as a fighter. Duyile: An Okinawan 22 year old College student whose hobby is reading. An underdog, he challenged the preconceived notions about him and became a Dark Horse amongst the tournament fighters. He employs the hard to integrate Halfmoon kick. Despite his cool exterior, he is the hottest Taekwondo star at the moment. Duyile wears a Blue and Black Taekwondo dobok and slicks his brown hair back with some bangs at the front. In the booklet he is wearing a conservative sweater whilst reading. Duyile is the game's first \\"Defense\\" type fighter and as such, defense is his main attribute, reducing his opponent's power stat when fought. Kyoji: At 16, he's the youngest fighter in the game and he's still a high schooler, hailing from the Hokkaido region. Kyoji seems to love speed and his hobby is biking. It seems that Kyoji was suspended in the past for excess contact, perhaps hinting at his impulsiveness and short tempered, as he is depicted cross-armed and with an impatient scowl in-game. He is the one of the fastest fighters around, with movements approaching 150 km in speed. Kyoji is the game's first \\"Speed\\" type character, and as such relies on his quick movement and rush-down attacks to compensate his lack of power.

Miss International 1974 On October 9, 1974, Galvan represented the United States as Miss American Beauty in the Miss International 1974 pageant in Tokyo and was crowned the eventual winner of the title, receiving two million yen in first prize money. Life after Miss International In January 1975, Galvan was briefly signed by Wilhelmina Models, but New York City's jet set life proved to be overwhelming for her small-town upbringing and she returned to Austin one month later. After crowning Miss International 1975, Galvan stayed for six months in Japan, working as a model and making appearances across the country. Then she returned to the United States and continued her work as a model in Dallas for three more years. In 1980, Galvan married husband David with whom she has six children, and moved to Helotes, Texas near the Hill Country in San Antonio's metropolitan area to focus on raising a family.

Completed in 1943, the ship was damaged during the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September and spent all of 1944 in Norwegian waters. She was damaged by British aircraft attacking the battleship in July. Z33 escorted troop convoys from northern Norway when the Germans began evacuating the area beginning in October. She ran aground in early 1945 as she was sailing for the Baltic and was badly damaged. While the ship was being towed to port for repairs, she and her escorts were attacked by Allied fighter-bombers. Z33 finally reached the Baltic in early April, but was reduced to reserve for lack of fuel. The ship was transferred to Cuxhaven and decommissioned shortly before the end of the war. Z33 was allocated to the Soviet Union in late 1945 and turned over at the beginning of 1946. Renamed Provornyy, the ship subsequently served with the Soviet Navy. She became a training ship in 1954 before she was converted to an accommodation ship the following year. Provornyy was badly damaged by a fire in 1960 and was scrapped in 1962. Design and description The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936A class and had a heavier armament. The class had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers. The ships had a design speed of , and their maximum speed was .Gröner (1990), p. 204 The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of at a speed of . The crew of the ships numbered 11–15 officers and 305–21 enlisted men, plus an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship.Koop & Schmolke (2014), p. 27 The Type 1936A (Mob) ships were armed with five TbtsK C/36 guns in a twin-gun turret forward and three single mounts with gun shields aft of the main superstructure. Their anti-aircraft armament varied and Z33s consisted of four Flak M42 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and ten C/38 guns in two quadruple and two single mounts. The ships carried eight torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines. A S-Gerät sonar was also probably fitted.Whitley (1991), pp. 68, 71–72, 201Gröner (1990), pp. 203, 206Gardiner & Chesneau (1980), p. 234 The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar set above the bridge as well as FuMB 3 Bali, FuMB 6 Palau, FuMB 26 Tunis, and FuMB 31 radar detectors.Koop & Schmolke (2014), p. 40 =Modifications= A FuMB 4 Sumatra radar detector was added after completion and a FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 1944–1945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. In early April 1945, one 15 cm gun was transferred to her sister to replace a damaged weapon. About that same time her anti-aircraft guns were removed. When the destroyer was ordered to the German Bight later that month, they were replaced by weapons taken from the wreck of the heavy cruiser Lützow. By the end of the war, Z33s anti-aircraft suite consisted of ten 3.7 cm gun in five twin mounts and a dozen 2 cm guns in one quadruple, two twin and four single mounts.Koop & Schmolke (2014), pp. 35, 40 Service history Z33 was first ordered from Seebeckwerft (yard number 665) as a Type 1938B destroyer on 28 June 1939, but the Kriegsmarine cancelled the order in September 1939, re-ordering the ship from AG Weser (Deschimag) (yard number W1003) as a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer on 19 September 1939. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard on 22 December 1940 and launched on 15 September 1941. Construction was slowed by shortage of manpower and materials and Z33 was not commissioned until 6 February 1943.Koop & Schmolke (2014), pp. 24–25; Whitley (1991), p. 34 The ship sailed to Norway shortly after she finished working up on 22 July. She took part in Operation Zitronella, the German raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September where she was hit by coastal artillery 33 times, killing 3 crewmen and wounding 25.Koop & Schmolke (2014), p. 114 Z33 was one of the escorts for the battleship during Operation Ostfront on 25 December, an attempt to intercept the British Convoy JW 55B that was bound for the Soviet Union. All of the battleship's escorts were detached the following day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the ensuing Battle of North Cape.Whitley (1991), p. 172 She remained in Norwegian waters through 1944. On 17 July 1944 Z33 was strafed by Vought F4U Corsair fighters of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm during Operation Mascot, an attack on the battleship Tirpitz, but only suffered superficial damage.Brown (2009), p. 28 Beginning in October, the ship escorted convoys during Operation Nordlicht, the evacuation of northern Norway. On 27 December Z33 laid a minefield off Honningsvaag together with her sister . The two ships laid another minefield off Hammerfest on 3 January 1945.Rohwer (2005), pp. 378, 384 Z33 under attack by Allied aircraft on 9 February 1945 Z33 departed for Germany on 5 February, but ran aground in Brufjord two days later. The impact severely damaged her port propeller shaft and its propeller, knocked out both turbines, and caused flooding. While under tow to Trondheim she was attacked by Allied Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers two days later while anchored in Førde Fjord. The destroyer was further damaged during the attack, but she and her escorts shot down seven Beaufighters, which later became known by the squadrons involved as the \\"Black Friday\\" airstrike for the heavy casualties that they suffered.Conyers Nesbit (1995), pp. 228–230; Goulter (1995), p. 254 Once repairs were completed she sailed for Swinemünde on 26 March and arrived there on 2 April. Due to Germany's shortage of fuel the ship was laid up and saw no further combat. All of her anti-aircraft guns were removed shortly after her arrival. Before Z33 departed Swinemünde on 27 April to be decommissioned at Cuxhaven, her anti-aircraft weapons were replaced by guns taken from the wreck of Lützow.Koop & Schmolke (2014), pp. 35, 114 After the war Z33 sailed to Wilhelmshaven and was overhauled to keep her seaworthy while the Allies decided how to divide the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves as war reparations. The ship was allotted to the Soviet Union in late 1945 and turned over on 2 January 1946 before departing for Liepāja, Latvia.Whitley (1991), pp. 191–92 She was renamed Provornyy (Проворный, “Nimble”) and assigned to the Red Banner Baltic Fleet. She briefly became a training ship on 30 November 1954 before was reclassified as an accommodation ship on 22 April 1955. During 1960, Provornyy was badly damaged by a fire and sank at her moorings. She was refloated two years later and then scrapped.

In the 1970s he achieved some renown, winning the Prix Medicis in 1973 for his novel Paysage de Fantaisie. Duvert's writings are notable both for their style and core themes: the celebration and defence of pedophilia, and criticism of modern child-rearing. In the 1970s attitudes to sexual liberation and child sexuality allowed Duvert to express himself publicly. However, when attitudes altered markedly in the 1980s, he was left feeling frustrated and oppressed. Youth and early writings Tony Duvert was born on 2 July 1945 in Villeneuve-le-Roi, Val-de-Marne. As a child he was shy and withdrawn, but was later to write that his sex life began when he was eight.Tony Duvert, L'Enfant au masculin, éditions de Minuit, 1980, page 25 Expelled from school at twelve for homosexuality, he was sent by his parents to a psychiatrist for treatment: the methods used he described as brutal and humiliating.Tony Duvert, L'Enfant au masculin, éditions de Minuit, 1980, pages 32-33 He ran away from home and attempted suicide.Gilles Sebhan, Tony Duvert l'enfant silencieux, Denoël, 2010, p. 29-31 and 109 In 1961, Duvert joined the high school Jean-Baptiste Corot in Savigny-sur-Orge, where he was a brilliant student, but with few friends. After high school he moved to Paris to begin an arts degree but preferred to devote himself to writing. Duvert made his literary debut in 1967 with Récidive, published by Jerome Lindon of Editions de Minuit, who recognised his potential. However the novel's subject matter made the publisher nervous, and the book was printed in a limited edition of 712 copies available only through subscription and selected bookstores. Highly productive, Duvert soon produced three successive novels: Interdit de séjour and Portrait d'homme-couteau in 1969, and Le Voyageur in 1970, which were also sold by subscription. As well as their political aspect in promoting sexual relations between adults and children, and criticising of bourgeois society, these first four novels featured narrative and stylistic experimentation in the form of rambling style, typographic games, the absence or multiplicity of plots, jumbled chronology or facts, and lack of punctuation. Critical recognition Thanks to Roland Barthes, Duvert achieved public recognition in 1973 with his novel Paysage de fantaisie (Strange Landscape), which won the Prix Medicis, and which was greeted warmly by critics. For Claude Mauriac the book revealed \\"gifts and art that the word talent is not enough to express\\"Claude Mauriac, « Une littérature corrosive », Le Figaro littéraire n°1396, 17 February 1973, II, p. 16 In 1974, Duvert expounded his ideology at length in Le Bon Sexe Illustré (Good Sex Illustrated) in which he sharply criticised sex education and the modern western family. Critics praised its humor and his ability to observe the false pretenses of bourgeois society. With his literary prize money Duvert moved to Morocco, an experience which resulted in his next novel Journal D’un Innocent, (Journal of an Innocent) published in 1976. Disillusioned by its society, he moved to Thore la Rochette, before settling in Tours. His next novel Quand Mourut Jonathan (When Jonathan Died), published in 1978, was inspired by an earlier vacation with a neglected boy. Despite his productivity and critical success, Duvert had not achieved the public success he hoped for. To reach a wider audience and raise awareness of his ideas, he decided to write a novel that would incorporate his favorite themes while being less sexually explicit and written in a classic form. The result was L'Île Atlantique (1979, published in English as Atlantic Island in 2017), which received critical raves, and sold somewhat better than his previous works.Gilles Sebhan, Tony Duvert l'enfant silencieux, Denoël, 2010, pp.102-103 Lack of exposure to English audiences Apart from Good Sex Illustrated, Diary of an Innocent, and Atlantic Island, all published by Semiotext(e)/MIT Press, English translations of Duvert's novels and other books are out of print and difficult to find. Withdrawal from the world and death In the 1980s, Duvert published L’enfant au masculin (1980), in which he further expounded his sexual philosophy; a novel Un Anneau d’Argent à l’Oreille; and a book of aphorisms Abécédaire Malveillant: unlike his earlier writings, their critical reception was mostly indifferent or poor. By the late 1980s, Duvert was unable to pay the rent on his apartment. With the social mood towards pedophilia hardening in the wake of several abuse scandals, he felt the world had turned against him. He withdrew to his mother's house in Loir-et-Cher, and became a total recluse. Duvert published nothing further, and was largely forgotten. However, in 2005, his novel L'Île Atlantique, which had first appeared in 1979, was adapted for television by Gerard Mordillat. Tony Duvert's body was discovered at his home in August 2008, several weeks after his death, in a state of decomposition. His death briefly raised his media profile in France again; obituaries noting the quality of his writing, but also reflecting upon the change in official attitudes to child sexuality. Gilles Sebhan has published two French-language biographical works on Duvert, Tony Duvert: L'Enfant Silencieux (Éditions Denoël 2010) and Retour à Duvert (le dilettante 2015). To date, neither book has been translated into English.

The Hebrew Gospel and the Development of the Synoptic Tradition In 2009, Edwards advanced a controversial theory that the synoptic Gospels are partly dependent on the \\"Hebrew Gospel\\" which includes Gospel of the Hebrews, a syncretistic Jewish–Christian text believed by most scholars to have been composed in Koine Greek, the Hebrew Gospel hypothesis of Lessing and others, and traditions of a writing of Matthew's supposed to have been written by him “in the Hebrew language” (Papias) and Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, 1385, a rabbinical translation of Matthew's gospel.The Whitworthian Monday, November 23, 2009 \\"Professor's book 'controversial' - News \\"Edwards said the Hebrew Gospel has remained largely unstudied in the theological world and, in his opinion, has been scandalously overlooked. \\"Most scholars don't know much about the Hebrew gospel and many deny that it existed,\\" he said.

Though no copies of the Hebrew Gospel are known to exist, Edwards' research and study of ancient manuscripts has convinced him to believe unwaveringly that it once did. \\"We know [the Hebrew Gospel] did exist because it was referred to about 100 times in the first nine centuries of Christianity,\\" he said.\\"The Whitworthian FRIDAY, APRIL 9, 2010 Whitworth professor of theology releases groundbreaking new book about the gospels - James Edwards challenges long-held \\"Q hypothesis,\\" asserts existence of a Hebrew gospelDallas Theological Seminary review Edwards argues that patristic citations from \\"the Hebrew Gospel\\" correlate more distinctly and repeatedly with sections called \\"Special Luke\\" in Gospel of Luke than with either Gospel of Matthew or Gospel of Mark.James R.

The administrative headquarters was Coimbatore city. Most of Coimbatore's inhabitants were Tamil-speaking but there were also large numbers of Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada speaking people.

Coimbatore came under Muslim rule in the 13th century AD and was a province of the Vijayanagar Empire. After the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire, Coimbatore was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks till 17th century. A series of wars between the Kingdoms of Kingdom of Mysore of Madurai Nayak dynasty resulted in the region coming under the control of Mysore kings till the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Third Mysore War in 1792, Coimbatore became a part of British India. The district was founded in 1805. In 1868 Nilgiri District was segregated. The Avinashi taluk was formed when Karur was separated from the district and merged with Trichinopoly District. In 1927 and 1929 other readjustments were made. In 1956 the Kollegal taluk was transferred to Mysore State. In 1975 and 1979 some subtaluks were promoted to taluks, including Satyamangalam, Perundurai and Mettupalayam, so that Coimbatore district ended up with 12 taluks, but before the end of 1979 the six taluks of Bhavani, Gopichettipalaiyam, Satyamangalam, Erode, Perundurai and Dharapuram, were segregated to form Erode district.

M. (1961) \\"The beylicate in Ottoman Egypt during the seventeenth century\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 24(2): pp. 214-248, page 242, Governorship Halil Pasha assumed office by arriving in Egypt in October 1631. =Mecca war= On 17 March 1632, he received intelligence that Arab armies had been on their way from Yemen to Ottoman-held Mecca with intentions to conquer it, and that they had indeed successfully conquered it and sacked it, killing the Sharif of Mecca, among others. When Halil Pasha told this news to his troops in Cairo, one emir, Kasım Bey, volunteered to lead an expedition to Mecca to take the city back from the Yemenis. Halil Pasha agreed, further assigning him assistants and organizing the troop officers and ranks for the war. He made emir Ridwan Bey al-Zulfiqar the head of the land-based troops to Mecca and the amir al-hajj (\\"leader of the hajj caravan\\"), making him responsible for the food and water of the pilgrims' animals en route to Mecca. As the Ottoman army of Kasım Bey approached that of the Yemenis in Wadi Fatimah valley, a scout for the Yemenis, Kör Mahmud, scoped out the Ottoman army from behind a mountain. Seeing that it was too numerous to overcome, the Yemeni army retreated to Wadi Abbas valley and hid in a fort named Turbet. Meanwhile, Kasım Bey's Ottoman army entered Mecca, finding only 100 enemy troops who had not fled in time. After summarily executing them, the Ottoman army performed the ceremonies of Hajj, and then set out in search of the Yemeni army. In the same fashion, the Ottoman troops sailing to Jeddah found it deserted of enemy troops and took the city without resistance. After seven days of trekking, Kasım Bey's army located the Yemeni army's tents at the foot of the Turbet fort and engaged them in combat, in which the Yemenis lost about 100 men. The next day, Kasım Bey ordered his troops to attack the Yemenis by hiding at the wells that supplied their army with water. This plan proceeded successfully, causing the Yemenis over 200 casualties that day, most from thirst. The Yemenis finally capitulated and surrendered, meeting Kasım Bey's requests for them to turn over to him Kör Mahmud and his brother. Kasım Bey allowed the Yemenis to leave the fort; only 300 of the original 1000 remained alive. Returning to Mecca, the four chiefs of the Yemeni troops were put to death. This was followed by seven days of celebration, and when the Ottoman troops returned home to Cairo in August 1632, five more days of celebration occurred. =After the war= Halil Pasha's rule was reported to be a time of plenty for Egypt, with the price of corn falling 75%. One of Halil Pasha's acts was to put to death a Jew named Yakub, who had allegedly been putting stress on the populace with his usury. When Halil Pasha left office on 1 April 1633, the shops in Cairo were closed for a week in mourning of the end of his term. Later life After Halil Pasha returned to Istanbul, the sultan Murad IV confiscated his fortune and exiled him to Cyprus, but he later changed his mind and allowed him to continue his career as a statesman.

The texts belonging to this subgenre eulogize Dharmathakur, a folk deity worshipped in the Rarh region of Bengal. According to tradition, the earliest poet of Dharmamangal was Mayura Bhatta. The Dharmamangal texts were meant for singing during the twelve-day ritual ceremony, known as Gajan. These texts are part of a larger group of texts associated with the worship of Dharma. In addition to the Dharmamangal texts, this larger group includes a number of works known as the Dharmapurans, which narrate the story of creation and the liturgical works known as the Samjatpaddhatis.Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007). Bangala Sahityer Itihas, Vol.II, , Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , pp.110-79 Dharmamangal The texts of the Dharmamangal comprise two narratives, * the narrative of the Puranic king Harishchandra, his queen Madana and son Luichandra. With the grace of god Dharmathakur, Harishchandra was blessed with a son Luichandra, with the condition that the son would be given away to the cult of Dharmathakur. Harishchandra forgot about the condition. Later Dharmathakur showed up as a Brahmin, and asked for the cooked flesh of Luichandra. Harishchandra and Madana killed Luichandra and served his flesh. Luichandra was later restored to life after the king and the queen accepted the Dharmathakur cult. * the narrative of exploits of a folk hero of Bengal, Lausen. Most significant poets of Dharmamangal were Rupram Chakrabarty (17th century) and Ghanaram Chakrabarty (17th-18th century). Other poets of Dharmamangal include Khelaram Chakrabarty, Shrishyam Pandit, Dharmadas, Ramdas Adak, Sitaram Das, Yadunath or Yadavram Pandit, Maniklal Ganguli, Ramchandra Bandyopadhyaya, Narasimha Basu, Prabhuram Mukhopadhyaya, Hridayram Sau, Shankar Chakrabarty, Ramnarayan and Ramkanta Ray. Dharmapuran The texts of Dharmapuran begin with narrative of creation. The other narratives included in these texts are the narrative about Shiva, the hagiographies of Minanatha and Gorakshanatha, the narrative of Ganga, the narrative of Sada Dom and Ramai Pandit, the description of the atrocities of Dharma in Jajpur and the narrative of king Harishcahndra. The significant poets of Dhramapuran or Anilpuran were Ramai Pandit and Sahadeb Chakrabarty. Liturgical works The most significant liturgical work is the Dharmapujavidhan, ascribed to Ramai Pandit as well as to Raghunandan.

Construction and acquisition Beaumere II as Edward Franklin Albee IIs private motorboat Beaumere prior to World War I. She carries a life ring amidships bearing her earlier name Madge II.Beaumere II was built as the private motorboat Madge II in 1914 by the Gas Engine and Power Company and the Charles L. Seabury Company at Morris Heights, the Bronx, New York. She later was renamed Beaumere. On 29 June 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired Beaumere under a free lease from her owner, the vaudeville impresario Edward Franklin Albee II (1857–1930), for use as a section patrol vessel during World War I. The Navy took delivery of her from Albee on 18 July 1917. The Navy added the Roman numeral II to her name and commissioned her as USS Beaumere II (SP-444) on 22 October 1917 with Chief Boatswain A. Anderson, USNRF, in command. United States Navy service Assigned to the 3rd Naval District, Beaumere II operated principally from the New York Navy Yard, the Barge Office at Battery Park, and the Marine Basin at Ulmer Park in Brooklyn, New York, as a despatch boat for the rest of World War I and into early 1919. She spent her entire naval career carrying passengers between various locations on the shores of the East River and North River, to Staten Island, and as far north as West Point, New York, on the Hudson River. During portions of April, May, June, and September 1917, and again in January 1919, she alternated with the patrol boat as despatch boat at the Barge Office. She interspersed these active operations and stand-by periods with upkeep at the Marine Basin. Among the naval officers Beaumere II transported numerous times were Rear Admiral Cameron McRae Winslow, Inspector of Naval Districts on the Atlantic Coast, Rear Admiral Nathan R. Usher, Commandant of the 3rd Naval District, and Ushers chief of staff, Captain Louis R. de Steiguer, who was a frequent passenger. Other distinguished passengers included Vice Admiral DeWitt Coffman and his staff, on a trip from the New York Navy Yard out to the French Navy armored cruiser Dupetit-Thouars on 27 June 1918; Major General J. Franklin Bell, United States Army, who was embarked with a small party for an excursion up the Hudson River to West Point on 1 September 1918; Admiral William S. Benson, the Chief of Naval Operations, whom Beaumere II transported to the transport on 17 October 1918; and the Brazilian Ambassador to the United States E. H. DeGama and his wife, whom Beaumere II took out to the armored cruiser USS Pueblo (Armored Cruiser No.7) on 22 October 1918 for the start of DeGamas journey back to Rio de Janeiro. Perhaps Beaumere IIs most eventful trip occurred on 10 July 1918 with Captain DeSteiguer embarked. She was en route the Barge Office at Battery Park when she encountered a heavy swell caused by the passage of an outward-bound battleship. Water entered Beaumere IIs engine room through an open port, short-circuiting the port motor. Although hampered by having to proceed on one engine, Beaumere II continued on her way and delivered DeStiguer to the Barge Office safely. Disposal Beaumere IIs final voyage while in commission was to Pier 72 in New York City on 15 February 1919. After being decommissioned there, Beaumere II was stricken from the Navy List on 24 February 1919 and returned to Albee the same day. Later career Reverting to her original name, Beaumere, she remained under Albees ownership through 1929, after which she became the property of the Marine Sales and Service Company, of New York City. Her last owner appears to have been a Joseph White, through 1949, after which time the name Beaumere disappears from contemporary yacht registers.

The line constitutes part of the Beijing–Kunming passageway. Route The high-speed rail line connects Xian, in the Wei River Valley, Hanzhong, in the Han River Valley, and Guangyuan, Jiangyou and Chengdu in the Sichuan Basin. In the Qin Mountains, it has of tunnels, including six over in length. The railwonay passes under ecologically-sensitive areas including the Taibaishan and Hanzhong Crested Ibis National Nature Reserves, which are home to the endangered giant panda, golden snub-nosed monkey, takin and crested ibis. Over much of its length, the Xi'an–Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line largely parallels existing railways: the Yangpingguan–Ankang railway in southwestern Shaanxi (between Hanzhong and the Yangpingguan junction), and the Baoji–Chengdu railway in Sichuan (from Yangpingguan to Chengdu). However, the section from Xi'an to Hanzhong, crossing in tunnels under the Qin Mountains, follows an entirely new direct route. High speed rail reforms meant direct Chengdu-Lanzhou and Chongqing-Xi'an services would use a combination of Xi'an–Chengdu high-speed railway and Chongqing–Lanzhou railway from where they met at Guangyuan. This would negate the need to build a separate direct Chongqing-Xi'an or Chengdu-Lanzhou lines. , Chongqing Ribao, 2012-09-28 However, with the announcement of the expanded 8+8 high speed rail grid, the two originally planned lines were reinstated in the masterplan. The Chengdu- Xi'an HSR have to cross the Qin Mountains; to achieve that, trains must climb continuously at 2.5% inclination (2.5 meters up per 100 meters run) for 47 kilometers. Since most HSR trains with 250 km/h maximum speed are not equipped with sufficient redundant power to maintain max speed climbing, trains scheduled to run between Chengdu and Xi'an using 250 km/h max speed equipments have to reserve extra time for the tunnel. However, for trains that continue to Beijing via Xi'an-Zhengzhou High Speed Rail and Guangzhou-Beijing High Speed Rail, an equipment capable of 350 km/h operations must be utilized to reach regular speed on the Zhengzhou-Beijing part. With redundant power equipped for 350 km/h operations, they lose less speed going up the tunnel, thus spending less time; this has reportedly caused these trains to have to reduce speed to maintain proper separation.

He was noted for exposing the photographs of the Cottingley Fairies taken in the early 20th century as a hoax. Crawley was born in 1926 in Bow in London, and moved with his parents to Southend-on-Sea when he was four years old, later moving to Leigh-on-Sea. He was educated at Westcliff High School for Boys, and during World War II he was evacuated to Derbyshire where he was placed with a miner and his family. Already skilled at the piano, Crawley convinced his hosts to purchase a piano to allow him to continue practising.Staff. \\"Geoffrey Crawley, who has died aged 83, was a scientific journalist specialising in photography and in 1982 exposed the world's longest-running photographic hoax – the myth of the so-called Cottingley Fairies.\\", The Daily Telegraph, November 7, 2010. accessed November 10, 2010. As a child he learned photography from his father. He showed early talent at the piano, and pursued a performance career. He studied French and German at Selwyn College, Cambridge. Ill health forced him to abandon both his plans to become a professional musician and his studies. Crawley enjoyed a long career with BJP, joining in the 1960s as a contributor. He became the technical editor, and was promoted to editor in 1967, a position he held for 21 years. Following the sale of the magazine, he reassumed the position of technical editor, continuing until 2000, when he was in his seventies. In 2000 he moved to the Amateur Photographer, where he was a contributor until shortly before his death. In the 1980s, he published a series of articles debunking the Cottingley Fairies hoax, a series of photographs that had been taken by Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths starting in 1917 that purported to show the girls together with actual fairies and were used by Arthur Conan Doyle and others as evidence of the existence of supernatural entities.Simanek, Donald E. \\"Arthur Conan Doyle, Spiritualism, and Fairies \\", Lock Haven University, January 2009. Accessed November 8, 2010. While there were longstanding claims that the photographs were hoaxes, Crawley undertook \\"a scientific and analytical approach\\" to analyzing the images starting in the 1970s. After studying the capabilities of some of the cameras that had been used to take the photos, Crawley concluded that they would have been unable to capture images as sharp as the ones in the purported unaltered photographs. In a series of articles published in the British Journal of Photography in the early 1980s, Crawley concluded that the images had been manipulated and that the fairies were a hoax. The cousins would later admit that one of the girls had copied images of fairies from a book onto cardboard cutouts that were then photographed. Frances insisted that the final photo in the series was genuine, though Elsie acknowledged that they were all fakes. Crawley died at the age of 83 on 29 October 2010 at his home in Westcliff-on-Sea. He was survived by his wife, Carolyn and his son Thomas .

It has a length of through the provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi Province, traversing the north-south axis of the former, and will accommodate trains traveling at speeds up to . Travel time between the two terminal cities will be reduced from 16.5 hours to about three hours. Construction began on 3 December 2009 and was expected to cost ¥96.3 billion. The line was scheduled to be completed by 2013 or 2014. The Taiyuan-Xi'an section of the railway was opened on July 1, 2014; the Taiyuan-Yuanping section was opened on September 28, 2018; and the Datong-Yuanping section is currently not newly constructed but using quadruple tracks of North Tongpu Line between Yuanping West and Huairen East. Such service commenced on May 1, 2019. Route The high speed rail line will run down the length of Shanxi Province from Datong in the north through Shuozhou, Xinzhou, the provincial capital Taiyuan, Jinzhong, Linfen and Yuncheng. It crosses the Yellow River at Yongji, enter Shaanxi and reach Xian via Weinan and Lintong. As of early 2020 most of the high-speed line is finished, but the section between Huairen East and Yuanping West runs on the 153 kilometre-long Hanjialing–Yuanping railway, a four-track section of the Datong–Puzhou railway. The third and fourth tracks were built for passenger traffic with a design speed of 160 kilometres per hour and were opened on 29 March 2014. A new section of high-speed line, the Datong–Yuanping high-speed railway, is being built to replace it. Another short section of main line runs through and . The whole line now forms part of the Beijing–Kunming passageway of the 8+8 HSR Grid, now under development. The section between Xi'an and Xinzhou (where the proposed Xiong'an–Xinzhou high- speed railway—Xiongxin HSR—would branch off to Xiong'an) forms part of its main line, while the section between Xinzhou and Datong forms part of the Beijing–Zhangjiakou–Datong–Taiyuan branch. Together with the Shijiazhuang–Taiyuan high-speed railway, the Taiyuan-Xi'an section of the Datong–Xi'an passenger railway provides a potential more direct route for high-speed passenger trains between Beijing and Xi'an (and points west) than the usual route via Zhengzhou (1092 km via Taiyuan vs. 1212 km). However, as of early 2015, this route appears to be slower than the one via Zhengzhou, and does not seem to be used by any direct Beijing-Xi'an trains. Instead, some services run from Beijing via Taiyuan to the southwestern Shanxi (mostly Yuncheng), while others run between Taiyuan and Xi'an.

A second and larger replacement tower was built on the same site in 1896. It is the fourth oldest extant lighthouse in Western Australia and was Australia's first rotating beam lighthouse. A shipwreck which was partly caused by poor communications and misunderstood signals from the lighthouse prompted the construction of another lighthouse on the island in 1900. Location selection and obelisk Rottnest Island is the largest and northernmost of several islands near the Port of Fremantle. It is from the mouth of the Swan River and is generally the first land sighted by ships arriving from the west. The island is long, and at its widest point with a total land area of . The lighthouse site is at the highest point of the island at Wadjemup Hill, with the tower base above sea level. It is west of the Thomson Bay settlement and about south-west of the Geordie Bay settlement. Between 1837 and 1843, Commander John Clements Wickham led an expedition in with Lieutenant John Lort Stokes to chart sections of the Australian coastline. During the voyage, Fremantle was visited seven times and in the course of one of these visits on 25 March 1840, Stokes wrote in his journal > \\"We moved the ship to Rottnest Island, to collect a little material for the > chart and select a hill for the site of a lighthouse. The one we chose lies > towards the South east end of the island bearing N76°W (true) twelve miles > and a quarter from the .\\"Moynihan (1988) p.3. In October 1840, Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe, together with Wickham and Stokes published Sailing Directions for the Navigation About Rottnest Island. The document appeared in the Government Gazette and included > \\"Rottnest Island ... may now be distinguished from the mainland and Garden > Island by a white obelisk, 15ft in height, with a pole in the middle, of the > same length, which has recently been erected on its highest part near the > centre of the island.

Original tower Plan of the 1840s lighthouse Stokes returned to Fremantle in the Beagle in April 1843 and wrote > \\"In the forenoon of the 23rd we saw the lighthouse of Rottenest ; and > regarded it with great interest, as the work of the aborigines imprisoned at > the island.\\" Rottnest had been used as a prison for aborigines since 1838. Superintendent of Public Works Henry Trigg designed the first lighthouse and laid the foundation stone in January 1842. Perth builder Bayley Maycock oversaw construction of the tower at a cost of £500 and used labour provided by the prisoners and locally quarried limestone. Construction seemed to be quite protracted for reasons which are unclear--possibly because of resistance by the Prisoner's Superintendent Henry Vincent who disliked outside meddling on the island.Moynihan (1988) p.12. The first keeper, Samuel Thomas, was appointed on 18 January 1849--two years before the light was lit. Thomas's duties initially included operating a system of signalling using flags and flares to indicate the arrival of ships. Different signals and flag combinations indicated ships to the north or south of the island and these were monitored from a pilot's lookout at Bathurst Point on the North-Eastern extremity of the island and then relayed to Arthur Head at Fremantle. Four flagpoles were built at the lighthouse for signalling.Moynihan (1988) p.17. The flags were about square. When confirmation of a ship's arrival was received, the lookout man at Arthur Head raised a blue flag for the information of Fremantle residents. Vincent wrote to Colonial Secretary Henry Revett Bland on 25 August 1849, that \\"... the Tower of the Litehous is all finesh...\\". The conclusion of construction coincided with the closure of the island prison establishment and the removal of inmates back to the mainland. The aboriginal prison population did return however, between 1855 and 1931. The tower's completed height was shorter than the design, and commissioning was finally completed in 1851 when the revolving lamp and clockwork mechanism were fitted. Unusually for the period as most lighthouse lamps and mechanisms came from England, the machinery for the revolving catoptric light was designed and built in Fremantle. Assistant Surveyor-General Augustus Gregory designed the mechanism which comprised two sets of three oil-burning lamps, each with a silvered parabolic reflector. In 1850, a contract was let to Alfred Carson to construct the revolving apparatus at a cost of £43. The official opening on 1 June 1851 coincided with the twenty-second anniversary of the Colony and the opening of another lighthouse at Arthur Head. The light was visible for and had a characteristic five-second flash followed by a 55-second eclipse. The entire apparatus rotated once every two minutes. It was operated by a clockwork mechanism and the lamps consumed 3 gallons of coconut oil per week. In 1862, colza oilMoynihan (1988) p.13.From tourist information plaques at Wadjemup Hill and later in the century, kerosene were used as fuel. The octagonal lantern was high, and glazed with 160 panes of thick glass. The Argus reported on 31 July 1851 > \\"The light will consist of two groups of three powerful lamps each; the > whole revolving once in two minutes, and showing a flash of light of five > seconds' duration every minute, with intervals of 55 seconds of darkness. > The centre of the light is 197 feet above high water level, and at the > height of 18-feet may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 7 leagues.\\" The now demolished lighthouse keeper's quarters and a storeroom were constructed nearby. Thomas Carter succeeded Samuel Thomas as keeper in January 1853. The following year, on hearing that a vacancy for the keeper's position had occurred, John Duffield Senior wrote to the Colonial Secretary on 17 January asking that his son Samuel be considered. Governor Charles Fitzgerald approved Samuel Duffield's appointment as the third Rottnest lighthouse keeper the following day. Duffield, his wife and four children took up residence with an initial pay of £44 per year rising to £88 per year at his retirement in 1879 with a pension of £33 6d 8d. Duffield was the longest-serving lighthouse keeper at Rottnest. The lighthouse keeper lived an isolated existence, being required to be on duty at all hours. This would have been exacerbated by the absence until 1866 of a permanent road between the Thomson Bay settlement and the lighthouse.Somerville (1966) In 1863 the Admiralty issued its first publication of the west coast of Australia in The Australia Directory Vol. 3. The light was described as revolving and flashing for five seconds in every minute, and that it could be seen for on a clear day at an elevation of .Moynihan (1988) p.15. As to signalling, The Directory stated > \\"On the approach of a vessel by day, the lightkeeper makes a signal to the > pilot stationed at the north-east extreme of the island [Bathurst Point], > showing whether the vessel is about to enter the channel North or South of > Rottnest Island., the pilot will then proceed onboard. A vessel arriving at > Rottnest Island at night, and requiring a pilot, should show her position by > lights, blue lights or rockets, or by firing guns, when the lightkeeper will > give notice to the pilot, who will board the vessel as quickly as > possible.\\"Moynihan (1988) p.16. Repairs to the tower were made in 1879 and a new lens from England was ordered the following year. These works totalling £100 were approved in the Legislative Council in 1880. In March 1881 a new first order dioptric lamp was fitted and in 1887 a locally made revolving apparatus was installed.Moynihan (1988) p.33. However, the Harbour and Light Department described the light as being \\"behind the times\\". A first-order holophotal lantern with an estimated cost of £3,900 was ordered in 1891. The same year £6,000 was placed in the Government's budget estimates for a new lighthouse which had been under consideration for some time.  New tower  Official opening of the second lighthouse on 17 March 1896. The original and smaller lighthouse adjacent was demolished soon afterwards. A section of the lens Tenders for the new tower were accepted in October 1894 for £3,237 4s. 9d. from Messrs Parker and Rhodes and construction commenced in March 1895. The foundation stone was laid on 25 April 1895 by the Premier of Western Australia, Sir John Forrest and included the placement of a glass bottle in a niche in the stone, containing newspapers, coins and copies of plans of the new lighthouse. It was designed by British engineer William Douglass with construction overseen by the colony's Engineer-in-Chief, C. Y. O'Connor. Douglass also designed the Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse which was built between 1895 and 1896. The Leeuwin lighthouse was opened in December 1896. Construction of the new tower alongside the original lighthouse was completed in 1896 and on the occasion of its opening on 17 March The West Australian newspaper reported > \\"The light is a first order Holophotal Revolving Light of 920 millimetres > focal distance constructed by Messrs.

The superstructure is above this and comprises of hard limestone. The outer diameter is about at ground level and the walls are thick. At the top of the tower the inner diameter is and the walls excluding capping are thick. The lantern house is high. Stone for the new tower was transported to the site from a quarry at Nancy Cove, about South-West, along a tramway built for the task. The light characteristic was initially a flash for 3 seconds and a 17-second eclipse. There being eight lens panels, the apparatus revolved every 2 minutes 40 seconds. The new tower almost doubled the height of the previous one and accommodated a more powerful candle power lamp which was visible for .Moynihan (1988) p.35. At the opening ceremony the Governor Sir Gerard Smith referred to the lighting of the lamp as \\"this new light symbolises the progress and vigour of the colony\\". At the same ceremony, Premier Forrest said > \\"The lighthouse is not only a light to guide the mariner to our shores but > also a magnificent milestone on the road to the progress of the colony ... a > symbol to lead the people of the country on to great and noble deeds.\\" The existing lighthouse keeper's house was built at about the same time and the old tower was demolished a short time after the new tower was commissioned. The head keeper at the time of the opening was William Brown and his assistant keepers were David Mitchinson and David Baird. In the year ended June 1908 the wick burners were replaced by a Chance incandescent petroleum vapour burner and the light output was increased from to candle power. This was increased to candles in February 1927 and the current mercury float pedestal and clockwork (now electrified) mechanism was installed in March 1929.Moynihan (1988) p.134. At the same time, the light characteristic was changed to a 0.4 second flash with a 4.6 second eclipse. The revolution time was thus 40 seconds. Electrification was done on 15 January 1936 and power increased to candles.Moynihan (1978) p. 134. states that the light was increased to candle power in 1936. All other sources consulted state candelas and as do almost all first order lighthouses worldwide. The higher figure is therefore assumed to be an error. The light characteristic changed to 0.2 second flash with a 7.3 second eclipse. The apparatus revolution time became one minute.  City of York incident  On 12 July 1899 the lighthouse was involved in a major shipwreck event, when a British owned barque City of York was wrecked off a reef to the north of the island. The ship had sailed from San Francisco with a cargo of timber and was en route to Fremantle when it was seen by the lighthouse keeper at 4:30 p.m. about distant. Conditions were stormy with blinding rain. The keeper signalled news of the sighting to the head pilot at Thompson Bay who readied himself and his pilot boat to go to the assistance of the ship once it signalled for a pilot. At 6:45 p.m. the ship had still not signalled for a pilot and the assistant lighthouse keeper challenged the ship by lighting a flare-up at the base of the lighthouse, meaning for the ship to stand off until the pilot had arrived. The captain however mistook the signal as being from a pilot boat itself and that it was the international code signifying that the ship should continue towards it (the pilot boat). He unwittingly sailed straight towards the shallow reefs which surround the island. 11 men including the captain drowned and the ship was lost. Another ship, the Carlisle Castle, was also lost in the same storm, but on the southern side of the island. Between 24 and 26 people, all on board, were drowned. There was no indication of the lighthouse having played a role in its loss. A second Rottnest lighthouse at Bathurst Point was built in 1900 on the north-east of the island partly in response to the incident, as well as other shipping disasters in the area.

The building is used nowadays for occasional accommodation for University and other scientific research groups working on the island.  Tourism and modern operations  Wadjemup Lighthouse was converted to automatic operations in November 1986 and is currently operated to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The last lighthouse keeper left the island in 1990. It is a popular tourist site with volunteer guides offering hourly tours of the precinct and to the top of the tower with information on the site's history. There are 155 steps to the top and the tour has views of the coastline around the island and back to the mainland around the Perth metropolitan area. The lantern is a diameter Chance Brothers device with a focal radius 8-panel catadioptric lens from the same company. It rotates once every 60 seconds on a mercury float pedestal. It is powered by 240-volt electricity from the island's mains supply and has a 2.5kVa diesel backup system. The light is above sea level and has a nominal range of and geographical range of . Its current light characteristic is a single flash of 0.07 seconds every 7.5 seconds with an eclipse of 7.43 seconds.

Although nothing remains of it today, the general location retains its cultural significance from the first half of the twentieth century as a theatre precinct, thanks to the nearby construction of Queensland Performing Arts Centre (QPAC) in 1985. Its name lives on in the new Cremorne Theatre, one of the venues within QPAC.  Location  The Cremorne Theatre was located on the river side of Stanley Street, South Brisbane, between Peel and Melbourne Streets, just to the north of where the Victoria Bridge crossed the Brisbane River from the city (). The street alignments were changed with the South Bank development in the 1980s, with Stanley Street removed for much of its length from Vulture Street up to today's Stanley Place. The old Theatre site is under the current Queensland Art Gallery, not far from the 1985 QPAC theatre complex. QPAC's site on Melbourne Street adjoins the Cultural Centre Tunnel which turns under what would have been that street's intersection with Stanley Street and then follows the old street alignment past the Cremorne Theatre site.Stanley Street, Brisbane History =Prior to the theatre= The theatre when it opened in 1911 was originally called the Cremorne Gardens, taking the name from a previous venue at the Stanley Street site. The name connects Brisbane to a riverside \\"pleasure garden\\" tradition from the Cremorne Gardens in London (1845–1877) and its Australian equivalents such as Cremorne Gardens, Melbourne (1853–1863); Sydney (1856–1862); Albany (1896–1910), Kalgoorlie (1907 – current) and Perth (1895–1914) WA; and in Queensland: Rockhampton Bernard Pene adopted the name Cremorne Gardens for this facility by the following June. (1863 – 1886 Note that Cremorne Gardens continued as a sports ground into the 1890s, but this seems to be the end of the facility as a professionally run pleasure garden.), Mackay (1886–1958) and Charters Towers (1902 – 1910? There is no definitive mention of the Cremorne Gardens on Trove in The Northern Miner after this date.). The current South Bank development itself can be seen as a modern equivalent to the Cremorne Gardens concept, at a scale much closer to the originals in London and Melbourne. These pre-1911 Brisbane Cremorne Gardens, were likely, given the site size, much more modest than their antecedents. The first mention of them is being advertised as a concert venue for a pantomime company and a violin concert in 1902. The venue is also referred to in the Advertisement as O'Connor's Gardens. J.D. O'Connor was the publican of O'Connor's Hotel in Stanley Street in 1902. J.D. O'Connor's father-in-law, John Graham, had owned land in South Brisbane since 1842, and had run hotels in the vicinity from 1866 to 1896. In 1888 John Graham established Graham's Family Hotel in Stanley Street, South Brisbane and held the licence until 1896, Graham's Hotel, Stanley Street, during the 1893 floods when it was transferred to his son-in-law, who changed the name to O'Connor's Hotel. There is a report in 1903 of O'Connor's Hotel having gardens on an extensive site and including a theatre called the Cremorne Gardens: > \\"There is a great area of ground, and every part of it is judiciously > utilised. Between the frontages in Stanley and Grey streets are carpets of > green grass and a wealth of tropical foliage, amidst which are scattered > rustic seats and gas jets. ... There is even a theatre, known as Cremorne > Gardens, used occasionally for public entertainments, and frequently for > social gatherings.\\" Despite this report of a \\"theatre\\" existing in 1903, the historical sources cited in the next section all agree that the theatre was built in 1911. However, it is clear that a venue called Cremorne Gardens which included garden features was used for public performances for some years prior to 1911. Cremorne residence on Hamilton Hill, Brisbane, ca. 1906 In 1905, J.D. O'Connor built a home, Cremorne, Hamilton, which appears to have been named after this part of his business. The house survives today as a heritage-listed villa at 34 Mullens Street, Hamilton, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The Cremorne Gardens at O'Connor's Hotel continued as a concert and light theatre venue until 1909 when J.D. O'Connor retired and sold his business. =The theatre is built= Cremorne Theatre Brisbane, circa 1934 Brisbane's Cremorne Theatre (originally known as the Cremorne Gardens) was built in 1911 by variety entrepreneur Edward Branscombe as part of an Australia-wide circuit of open-air theatres designed especially for his Dandies costume comedy companies. Originally an open-air structure with seating for about 1,800, the Cremorne Theatre opened on 5 August 1911 with a light program of music and sketches under the title \\"The Dandies.\\" The newspaper, The Brisbane Courier, reported: > \\"...the goodly number of patrons present noted with satisfaction this well > arranged auditorium, the whole place, upon which the title of 'Cremorne' has > been bestowed, wearing an air of neatness, brightness and comfort.\\"This > quote was cited from Smith, Christopher. Treading the Boards: A survey of > theatre buildings in Brisbane 1847–1998, Public Programs Unit, Queensland > Performing Arts Trust, 1999, p. 43. Eight months later, a company, The Dandies Limited, was floated to buy the \\"Cremorne Gardens\\" site, which had an 88-foot frontage to Stanley Street, and also the theatrical business. The Prospectus claimed that £5,000 of improvements had been made to the property. Brisbane's subtropical climate meant that the theatre's use was frequently interrupted by rainfall and it was closed temporarily in 1917 while weatherproof awnings were erected. The theatre was at first managed, and then after its sale in 1916 by Branscombe's company, owned and operated, by John Neil McCallum,https://ozvta.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/cremorne-theatre- bris-1842014.pdf  Cremorne Theatre History entry Australian Variety Theatre Archive Popular Culture Entertainment: 1850–1930 Clay Djubal 2011 the father of Australian actor and producer, John McCallum.

From 1949 onwards, local groups used it for productions. In particular, The Brisbane Opera Society and the Theatre Guild of Queensland appeared there regularly. It was in fact with the Brisbane Opera Society, under the musical direction of George English, that arguably Australia's most famous operatic tenor Donald Smith (tenor), sang his first operas. Some of these operas included \\"Merry England\\" by Edward German, \\"The Bohemian Girl\\" by Michael William Balfe, \\"Maritana\\" by William Vincent Wallace, Gunoud's \\"Faust\\" and Ruggero Leoncavallo opera \\"Pagliacci\\". John McCallum leased the theatre to Universal International Pictures in 1951 and by mid-1952 the building had been converted for use as offices and storage facilities for film distribution. The last recorded program is for a production by the Musical & Theatre Guild of Queensland of \\"The Desert Song\\" on 3 May 1952.

Stein 1878 is a species of colonial green algae in the order Volvocales. The V. carteri life cycle includes a sexual phase and an asexual phase. V. carteri forms small spherical colonies, or coenobia, of 2000-6000 Chlamydomonas-type somatic cells and 12-16 large, potentially immortal reproductive cells called gonidia. While vegetative, male and female colonies are indistinguishable; however, in the sexual phase, females produce 35-45 eggs and males produce up to 50 sperm packets with 64 or 128 sperm each. The genome of this species of algae was sequenced in 2010. Volvox carteri is a significant model organism for research into the evolution of multicellularity and organismal complexity, largely due to its simple differentiation into two cell types, versatility in controlled laboratory environments, and natural abundance.  Differentiation  Volvox carteri is a useful model organism for understanding the evolution and developmental genetics of cellular differentiation, in part because asexual colonies possess only two cell types. Approximately 2000 biflagellated somatic cells form a monolayer at the surface of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cannot divide, rendering them mortal. They facilitate motility in response to changes in light concentration (phototaxis), which is detected via an orange photoreceptor-containing eyespot. Gonidia, by contrast, are immobile, embedded in the ECM interior, and are potentially immortal due to their ability to divide and participate in reproduction. Three key genes are known to play significant roles in the somatic-gonidium dichotomy: glsA (gonidialess A); regA (regenerator A); and lag (late gonidia). These genes are believed to carry out germ-soma differentiation during development in a general order: # gls specifies cell fate based on size # lag genes facilitate gonidial development in large cells # reg genes facilitate somatic development in small cells The glsA gene contributes to asymmetric cell division that results in the designation of large cells that develop into gonidia and small cells that develop into somatic cells. Gls mutants do not experience asymmetric division, a key component for creating gonidia, and thus are composed only of somatic swimming cells. The lag gene plays a role in specialization of gonidial initials. If mutations disable the lag gene, large cells specified by glsA will develop as somatic cells initially but then de-differentiate to become gonidia. Determination of somatic cells is controlled by the transcription factor regA. The regA geneencodes a single 80 amino acid-long DNA-binding SAND domain that is expressed in somatic cells after embryonic development. regA acts to prevent division by inhibiting cell growth via downregulation of chloroplast biosynthesis, and represses expression of genes necessary for germ cell formation. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular relative of V. carteri, is known to possess genes related to regA. This suggests that the regA gene originated before proper cellular differentiation in Volvox and was likely present in an undifferentiated ancestor. In this case, the function of regA in V. carteri most likely arose due to changes in expression pattern from a temporal (environmental response) state to a spatial (developmental) state.  Genomics  The V. carteri genome consists of 138 million base pairs and contains ~14,520 protein-coding genes. Like many other multicellular organisms, this alga has a genome rich in introns; approximately 82% of the genome is non-coding. The V. carteri genome has a GC content of approximately 55.3%. Over 99% of the volume of a V. carteri colony is made up of a glycoprotein-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Several genes involved in ECM construction and ECM proteins have been identified in V. carteri. These genes account for the expanded inner layer of the cell wall (ECM) and the count and diversity of genes encoding VMPs (Volvox matrix metalloproteases) and pherophorins (ECM protein families). Volvox has multiple sex-specific and sex- regulated transcripts, including MAT3, an rb-homologous tumor suppressor that displays evidence of sex-specific selection and whose alternative splicing is sexually regulated. Sexual reproduction V. carteri can reproduce either asexually or sexually. Thus, it is a facultatively sexual organism. In nature, Volvox reproduces asexually in temporary ponds in spring, but becomes sexual and produces dormant over-wintering zygotes before the ponds dry up in the summer heat. V. carteri can be induced to reproduce sexually by heat shock treatment. However, this induction can be inhibited by antioxidants indicating that the induction of sex by heat shock is mediated by oxidative stress. It was further found that an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that induces oxidative stress also induced sex in V. carteri. Nedelcu and Michod and Nedelcu et al. It has been suggested that oxidative DNA damage caused by oxidative stress may be the underlying cause of the induction of sex in their experiments. Other agents that cause DNA damage (i.e. glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde and UV) also induce sex in V. carteri. These findings lend support to the general idea that a principal adaptive function of sex is repair of DNA damages.Birdsell JA, Wills C (2003).

The fruit bodies, or mushrooms, have a conical brownish cap up to in diameter atop a slender stem up to long. It has a white partial veil that does not leave a ring on the stem. American mycologist Alexander H. Smith first described the species in 1937 as a member of the genus known today as Psathyrella; it was transferred to Psilocybe by Rolf Singer in 1958. Psilocybe pelliculosa is found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or clusters along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland, and also in Norway. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P. pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences in the form of the fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics. Taxonomy The species was first described scientifically by Alexander H. Smith in 1937 as Psathyra pelliculosa, based on specimens he collected in Washington and Oregon. The type specimen was collected near Tahkenitch Lake, Oregon, in November 1935. In a 1941 publication, Smith revised his opinion, and considered the species to be the same as Hypholoma silvatica (later Psilocybe silvatica), as he thought that the slight differences between the two were of no taxonomic significance. After reevaluating these two species in addition to several others closely related, Rolf Singer and Smith later reestablished the taxon and transferred it to Psilocybe in 1958. Psilocybe authority Gastón Guzmán classified the species in the section Semilanceatae, a grouping of related species characterized by having roughly ellipsoid, usually thick-walled spores, and lacking pleurocystidia.Guzmán (1983), p. 342. The specific epithet pelliculosa is derived from the Latin pellicula, meaning \\"film\\", and refers to the gelatinous pellicle of the cap. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"conifer Psilocybe\\" or the \\"striate Psilocybe\\". Description The cap of P. pelliculosa is initially sharply cone-shaped, and expands slightly over time to become broadly bell-shaped, but it never expands to become completely flat. The cap margin is pressed against the stem initially, and for a short time is appendiculate (has partial veil fragments hanging from the margin). The caps of mature specimens are smooth, sticky, and have translucent radial striations that reach dimensions of in diameter. The color ranges from umber to isabella (dark dingy yellow-brown) when the mushroom is moist, and changes to pinkish- buff when dry. The cap margin can have a greenish-gray tinge. The cap cuticle is a thin gelatinous covering that can be peeled off. The gills have an adnate attachment to the cap, are narrow to moderately broad, closely spaced, and eventually separate from the stem. Young gills are cinnamon-brown in color, with lighter edges, but darken in maturity because they become covered with the dark spores. The stem is long by thick, and roughly equal in width throughout except for a slightly enlarged base. The lower region of the stem is brownish in color and has silky \\"hairs\\" pressed against the stem; the upper region is grayish and pruinose (lightly dusted with powdery white granules). The flesh turns slightly bluish or greenish where it has been injured. The application of a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide solution on the cap or flesh will cause a color change to pale to dark yellowish to reddish brown; a drop on the stem produces a less intense or no color change. The spore print is purplish brown. Under the microscope, the spores appear dull purple-brown. They are ellipsoid to somewhat egg-shaped, and, according to Singer's original description, measure 8–10 by 4–5 μm. A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia, Canada, instead reported a larger spore size range of 10–13 by 6–7 μm. The spores have an apical germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 22–35 by 7–10 μm. There are abundant cystidia that form a sterile band on the edges of the gills (cheilocystidia); these cystidia are smooth, inflated, and fusoid-ventricose (enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends) with an sharp tip, and measure 25–30 by 6–9 μm. The cap cuticle (an ixocutis) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal, gelatinized, wavy, hyaline hyphae that are 0.8–5.5 μm in diameter. =Similar species= Psilocybe semilanceata The overall stature of the fruit bodies of P. pelliculosa is generally similar to those of Mycena, Galerina, or Hypholoma. Smith noted a superficial resemblance to Psathyrella fagicola, based on similarities in the nature of the cap cuticle, the coloring, and the stem base covered in silky fibers. Psilocybe pelliculosa may be distinguished from Psathyra fagicola by the presence of a partial veil, firm gills, and smaller fruit bodies. P. pelliculosa is frequently mistaken for the widespread P. semilanceata, but the latter can be distinguished by its larger spores and a conical, papillate cap. Another similar species is Psilocybe silvatica, and a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between the two species. P. silvatica, found from New York to Michigan and north to Canada, has longer spores. P. pelliculosa has a general resemblance to Hypholoma dispersum,Stamets (1996), pp. 135–6. a species found in northern North America and Europe. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of P. pelliculosa grow in groups or clusters on moss, forest debris, and humus in coniferous forests. The fungus prefers to fruit in disturbed areas such as trails and abandoned forest roads;Stamets (1996), p. 2. it is not commonly found in grasslands.Guzmán (1983), p. 357–9. It is known from the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it has been collected in California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and it is widely distributed in British Columbia, Canada. It is also found in northern Europe, a single collection from Finland. The fungus often fruits along forest paths and abandoned logging roads where alders and firs are growing. Fruit bodies tend to appear in late summer to early winter after cool, wet weather. Psychoactivity Psilocybe pelliculosa contains the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, and is used as a recreational drug. In terms of psychoactive potency, Stamets considers the species \\"relatively weak\\". Psilocybin levels have been reported to range from 1.2 to 7.1 milligrams per gram of dried mushroom, while baeocystin was measured at 0.04%. According to some reports from the 1960s, the fungus does not produce psilocybin when fruit bodies are cultivated in the laboratory.

In mathematics, the rational points on the unit circle are those points (x, y) such that both x and y are rational numbers (\\"fractions\\") and satisfy x2 + y2 = 1\\\\. The set of such points turns out to be closely related to primitive Pythagorean triples. Consider a primitive right triangle, that is, with integer side lengths a, b, c, with c the hypotenuse, such that the sides have no common factor larger than 1\\\\. Then on the unit circle there exists the rational point (a/c, b/c), which, in the complex plane, is just a/c + ib/c, where i is the imaginary unit. Conversely, if (x, y) is a rational point on the unit circle in the 1st quadrant of the coordinate system (i.e. x > 0, y > 0), then there exists a primitive right triangle with sides xc, yc, c, with c being the least common multiple of the denominators of x and y. There is a correspondence between points (a, b) in the x-y plane and points a + ib in the complex plane which is used below. Group operation The set of rational points on the unit circle, shortened G in this article, forms an infinite abelian group under rotations. The identity element is the point (1, 0) = 1 + i0 = 1\\\\. The group operation, or \\"product\\" is (x, y) * (t, u) = (xt − uy, xu + yt). This product is angle addition since x = cos(A) and y = sin(A), where A is the angle that the vector (x, y) makes with the vector (1,0), measured counter-clockwise. So with (x, y) and (t, u) forming angles A and B with (1, 0) respectively, their product (xt − uy, xu + yt) is just the rational point on the unit circle forming the angle A + B with (1, 0). The group operation is expressed more easily with complex numbers: identifying the points (x, y) and (t, u) with x + iy and t + iu respectively, the group product above is just the ordinary complex number multiplication (x + iy)(t + iu) = xt − yu + i(xu + yt), which corresponds to the point (xt − uy, xu + yt) as above. =Example= 3/5 + 4/5i and 5/13 + 12/13i (which correspond to the two most famous Pythagorean triples (3,4,5) and (5,12,13)) are rational points on the unit circle in the complex plane, and thus are elements of G. Their group product is −33/65 + 56/65i, which corresponds to the Pythagorean triple (33,56,65). The sum of the squares of the numerators 33 and 56 is 1089 + 3136 = 4225, which is the square of the denominator 65. =Other ways to describe the group= ::G \\\\cong \\\\mathrm{SO}(2, \\\\mathbb{Q}). The set of all 2×2 rotation matrices with rational entries coincides with G. This follows from the fact that the circle group S^1 is isomorphic to \\\\mathrm{SO}(2, \\\\mathbb{R}), and the fact that their rational points coincide. Group structure The structure of G is an infinite sum of cyclic groups. Let G2 denote the subgroup of G generated by the point . G2 is a cyclic subgroup of order 4. For a prime p of form 4k + 1, let Gp denote the subgroup of elements with denominator pn where n is a non-negative integer. Gp is an infinite cyclic group, and the point (a2 − b2)/p + (2ab/p)i is a generator of Gp. Furthermore, by factoring the denominators of an element of G, it can be shown that G is a direct sum of G2 and the Gp. That is: ::G \\\\cong G_2 \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{p \\\\, \\\\equiv \\\\, 1 \\\\, (\\\\text{mod } 4)} G_p. Since it is a direct sum rather than direct product, only finitely many of the values in the Gps are non-zero. =Example= Viewing G as an infinite direct sum, consider the element ({0}; 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0, ...) where the first coordinate 0 is in C4 and the other coordinates give the powers of (a2 − b2)/p(r) + i2ab/p(r), where p(r) is the rth prime number of form 4k + 1\\\\. Then this corresponds to, in G, the rational point (3/5 + i4/5)2 * (8/17 + i15/17)1 = −416/425 + i87/425. The denominator 425 is the product of the denominator 5 twice, and the denominator 17 once, and as in the previous example, the square of the numerator −416 plus the square of the numerator 87 is equal to the square of the denominator 425. It should also be noted, as a connection to help retain understanding, that the denominator 5 = p(1) is the 1st prime of form 4k + 1, and the denominator 17 = p(3) is the 3rd prime of form 4k + 1\\\\. The unit hyperbola's group of rational points There is a close connection between this group on the unit hyperbola and the group discussed above. If \\\\frac {a + ib}{c} is a rational point on the unit circle, where a/c and b/c are reduced fractions, then (c/a, b/a) is a rational point on the unit hyperbola, since (c/a)^2-(b/a)^2=1, satisfying the equation for the unit hyperbola. The group operation here is (x, y) \\\\times (u, v)=(xu+yv, xv+yu),and the group identity is the same point (1, 0) as above. In this group there is a close connection with the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine, which parallels the connection with cosine and sine in the unit circle group above. =Copies inside a larger group= There are isomorphic copies of both groups, as subgroups (and as geometric objects) of the group of the rational points on the abelian variety in four-dimensional space given by the equation w^2+x^2-y^2+z^2=0. Note that this variety is the set of points with Minkowski metric relative to the origin equal to 0\\\\. The identity in this larger group is (1, 0, 1, 0), and the group operation is (a, b, c, d) \\\\times (w, x, y, z)=(aw-bx,ax+bw,cy+dz,cz+dy). For the group on the unit circle, the appropriate subgroup is the subgroup of points of the form (w, x, 1, 0), with w^2+x^2=1, and its identity element is (1, 0, 1, 0). The unit hyperbola group corresponds to points of form (1, 0, y, z), with y^2-z^2=1, and the identity is again (1, 0, 1, 0). (Of course, since they are subgroups of the larger group, they both must have the same identity element.)

Bernheim discovered the enzyme system of tyramine oxidase during her doctorate research at the University of Cambridge in 1928, and her research has been referred to as \\"one of the seminal discoveries in twentieth century neurobiology\\".  Early life and education  Bernheim was born under the name Mary Lilias Christian Hare in Gloucester, England on 28 June 1902. However, she was referred to as \\"Molly\\" by those around her. As a child, Bernheim was raised in India. She obtained higher degrees of BA, MA, and PhD from the University of Cambridge in England. After finishing her undergraduate, Bernheim received the Bathurst Studentship to work on her PhD research in the Department of Biochemistry at the Newnham College of the University of Cambridge.  Discovery of monoamine oxidase  As a doctoral student, Bernheim was aware of the limited research which had been conducted on the catabolism of tyramine, a naturally occurring monoamine compound obtained from the amino acid tyrosine. Keeping in mind the availability of newly enhanced techniques for the analysis of oxidative processes, she decided to study the manner in which the addition of tyramine affected oxygen uptake in tissues. During the course of her work, Bernheim used rabbit liver extracts and obtained the enzyme by adding kaolin to the liver extracts at pH 6.5. Following this, crude tyramine was procured by heating tyrosine in the presence of the catalyst diphenylamine. The extracted enzyme was added to tyramine, in the presence of water and buffer, and the Barcroft technique was used to observe the amount of oxygen consumed by tyramine. She discovered that the oxidation of tyramine did take place, with the observation that one atom of oxygen was absorbed per molecule of tyramine present. This observation indicated the presence of an enzyme system within the studied liver extracts, which Bernheim named tyramine oxidase, since it was involved in the oxidation of tyramine. In addition to the discovery of the enzyme system, Bernheim observed several unique properties of the tyramine oxidase system. She noted that the methylene blue dye used in the experiment was not reduced. This observation indicated that the tyramine oxidase system, unlike other enzyme systems, was not able to use the dye as a hydrogen acceptor. Additionally, the oxidative process within this enzyme system was seen to be resistant to the addition of cyanide. This observation showed that the tyramine oxidase system was an exception to Warburg's statement, which claimed that direct oxidation could not occur unless atmospheric oxygen was activated by iron. Instead, the system was seen to produce hydrogen peroxide, indicating that molecular oxygen acted as a hydrogen acceptor in the system. Bernheim also detected that the enzyme facilitated the occurrence of deamination in tyramine, along with the process of oxidation. Prior to her discovery, tyramine had not been studied extensively from a biochemical perspective. = Importance of monoamine oxidase discovery = Breakdown of Norepinephrine, which belongs to the catecholamine family. Monoamine oxidase is depicted in the blue box on the left. Following her discovery, Bernheim predicted that tyramine oxidase was important for the oxidative deamination of tyramine, thus allowing for the detoxification of extra amines absorbed from the intestines. This prediction was proven correct by later research, which showed that patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors had toxic reactions to the consumption of food rich in tyramine. However, subsequent research indicated that the enzyme was involved in the oxidative deamination of additional monoamine neurotransmitters, including Catecholamines and histamine, as shown in the figure. The enzyme was eventually renamed as monoamine oxidase, indicating that the enzyme catalysed the oxidative deamination of the class of monoamines. After the discovery of monoamine oxidase (MAO), numerous studies were conducted to determine the biological importance of monoamines. Due to the significance of MAO in the inactivation of monoamine neurotransmitters, MAO dysfunction is believed to cause several psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. Upon the discovery that the MAO inhibitor iproniazid resulted in mood elevation, and thus could be used as an effective anti-depressant, there was a marked increase in pharmacological research on drugs regulating monoamine activity. Despite the fact that MAO inhibitors were eventually replaced by tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of depression, there is still enormous interest in the function of MAO. The discovery of different MAO subtypes has led to research on selective MAO subtype inhibitors, which have been shown to exhibit reduced side effects and greater specificity during inhibition. These MAO subtype inhibitors are being used in the treatment of geriatric depression and as potential replacements for MAO reuptake inhibitors. Additionally, the discovery of MAO in blood platelets has led to research on the function of platelet enzyme activity as an indicator of MAO dysfunction.  Duke Medical School faculty  In 1930, Bernheim was appointed as a member of the original faculty of Duke Medical School. When she began at Duke, Bernheim was notably one of few women in the Department of Biochemistry, either as a student or faculty member. She eventually became a full professor at Duke, and was teaching graduate students, medical students, and nursing students. During her time at Duke, the number of women in the medical school classes increased significantly from one or two women in a class of seventy-five students to women comprising more than half of the class. At the time of her death in 1997, she was the final surviving member of the original faculty of Duke Medical School.  Personal life  While at Cambridge, Hare met fellow graduate student Frederick Bernheim, and eventually married him on 17 December 1928. Over the course of her career, Bernheim had authored over sixty papers. Beyond biochemistry, Bernheim had interests in botany and flying. She published a book \\"A Sky of My Own,\\" in which she details her journey into the field of flying, and describes her experience as a pilot and flight instructor. Bernheim was recognised for her contributions to scientific research, and she was honoured at the Ciba Foundation symposium held in 1975 for her discovery of monoamine oxidase. Although she retired in 1983, she remained in a teaching position until her death on 19 November 1997 at the age of 95.

They are Indian Hindustani music artists who play instrumental Indian flute music. Early life Born into a well-known family of musicians in Allahabad, the Chatterjee sisters were prompted to learn flute by their parents Robin and Krishna Chatterjee, who were classical Hindustani vocalists. Robin, whose work led the family to live in Afghanistan for a time, suggested to his daughters that they become flautists, to fulfill a dream he had never been able to live up to. After returning to India, the sisters began their flute training under the tutelage of Pandit Bholanath Prasanna. In their teenage years, they began studying with flautist guru Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia. After completing their basic education, the sisters were awarded the Nuffic scholarship from the Indian Embassy in The Netherlands. They studied world music at the Rotterdam Conservatory, earning a certification with distinction for Uitvoerend Musicus (Performing Musician) and Docenten Musicus (Music Teacher) in 1998. Returning to India, they then completed a Sangeet Prabhakar (bachelor of music degree) from Prayag Sangeet Samiti in Allahabad in 2001. They were honoured with the performance medals for flute, with Suchismita getting the gold and Debopriya earning the silver medal. They continued at Prayag Sangeet Samiti, earning a Sangeet Pravin (master's degree of music) in 2005 with their medal positions reversed—Debopriya received gold and Suchismita, silver. They are both married and have children. While Suchismita lives in Pune, Debopriya makes her home in Mumbai. Career In 1995, the sisters debuted in Bombay at the Sampoorna Yugal Sangeet Ratri music conference. The program was telecast and earned them recognition for their performance of Indian classical music on the bansuri. They have played as a duo and were also accompanied their guru, performing flute concerts not only in India but abroad as well. They continued to win accolades from various public platforms where they performed. The sisters have also provided background music for TV serials such as Afsar Bitiya, Balika Vadhu and Crime Patrol. They believe that playing as a duo, known in Indian classical music as jugalbandi, is an advantage on the flute, as the instrument cannot be tuned, forcing the artist to adjust to the instrument. They consider their skills to be complementary, as they claim to have different strengths. As of 2016, the sisters are in their mid-thirties and enjoy a reputation as popular female flautists in India. Concerning this, Suchismita says: \\"I think it is due to a lack of prominent women flautists that girls these days don't think of it as an instrument to be played by women... We had no woman role model when we were growing up. One of the things we can do to change that is teach other children ourselves\\". To that end, the sisters have worked with several organisations, like the Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Amongst Youth, to give interactive performances for students in order for them to learn about India's musical heritage. In January 2014, the sisters gave a presentation combining talk and musical demonstrations at a cultural programme organized by the Symbiosis Institute of Mass Communications of Pune. They consider the flute to be \\"a full-fledged member of the Indian classical music family\\". The sisters hold that at its root, the flute is a folk instrument with a history embedded by legends of the Mahabharata period when Krishna wooed gopis with his bansuri or flute. Debopriya Chatterjee received a Sangeet Natak Academy award in the Hindustani Instrumental category as a flute artist from the Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar (Prize to Young Artists) in 2008. Both are graded artists of Aakashwani. They were honored as Sur Mani at the Kal Ke Kalakar conference in 2001. They have also been featured performers at Swami Haridas Sangeet Sammelan, a noted Indian classical music conference.

Both refused to bear arms. \\" Albert Merz belonged to the Merz family of southern Germany who were leading members of what was then known as the Urchristen (\\"Primitive Christian\\"),The German Christadelphians largely ceased using this name and adopted the Anglicized name Die Christadelphians in the early 1980s after the appearance of the Universal Life religion which also used the name. which was the German name for the Christadelphian church in Germany. The Urchristen church had its German origins due in part to the efforts of a Stuttgart tradesman Albert Maier who had travelled to the United States before World War 1 and had been introduced to Christadelphian beliefs while residing in America. Albert Maier subsequently joined the Christadelphian church there and then returned to Germany to the Stuttgart area before start of hostilities. His efforts to introduce others to Christadelphian teaching was instrumental in establishing the Christadelphian church in southern Germany. After the Nazi rise to power in 1933, the Christadelphian church, or as they were then known - the Urchristen, attracted particular attention for their pro-Jewish views and their belief that God would restore the Jews to a national homeland in Israel.Bogner \\"Das Jahr 1933, ein Schicksalsjahr der Weltgeschichte, brachte auch für uns einschneidende Veränderungen. Hitlers Feindschaft gegen die Juden richtete sich auch gegen uns, weil wir Freunde Israels sind. Einige Brüder, die zum Wehrdienst eingezogen werden sollten, verweigerten diesen und wurden deshalb zu je eineinhalb Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt.\\" The first member of the Merz family to be incarcerated was August Merz who was condemned to a concentration camp for religious and political prisoners in 1938, where he survived six years until the camp was liberated in 1945. The next was Rudolf Merz who was committed to an insane asylum for his pacifist views. He too survived.Bogner \\"Dann kam der zweite Weltkrieg. Nun wurde Bruder August Merz ins Konzentrationslager gebracht, wo er sechs Jahre bis zum Kriegsende ausharren musste. Sein Bruder Rudolf wurde in eine Irrenanstalt eingewiesen und dort ebenfalls bis zum Kriegsende festgehalten.\\" Although all three brothers were conscientious objectors, only Albert received the death penalty. The different fates of the three brothers show how Nazi treatment of objectors changed in World War II. Albert Merz was called up for military service in early 1941, but immediately refused on the basis of conscientious objection as his brothers had done before him. He was sent to the Brandenburg-Görden Prison where he was executed on April 3, 1941.Bogner \\"Ende des Jahres 1940, im zweiten Kriegsjahr, ist Bruder Albert Merz zum Wehrdienst aufgerufen und nach Kriegsdienstverweigerung am 4.

New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics 14(3):427–468. Geology The exposed bulk of Turbidite Hill consists of a very thick diabase (dolerite) sill that is part of the Ferrar Dolerite. The summit of Turbidite Hill consists of a relatively thin layer of sedimentary rock of the Buckley Formation (Coal Measures), which is part of the Beacon Supergroup. This layer is either a large block of sedimentary rock enclosed within a diabase sill or a layer of sedimentary rock lying between two sills.Isbell, J.L., G.M. Seegers, G. Gelhar, and P. MacKenzie (1994) Stratigraphy of Upper Carboniferous and Permian rocks exposed between the Byrd and Nimrod Glaciers. Antarctic Journal of the U.S. 29(5)35-36. At Turbidite Hill, the Buckley Formation consists of cross-bedded medium- and coarse-grained sandstone, thin silty carbonaceous sandstone, muddy siltstone, and thin coal seams. The sandstone exhibits cross-bedding, convoluted bedding, and cross-laminations. Beds of sandstone with laminated bases that grade upward into ripple-drift laminated and convoluted siltstone are common. Sandstones, which are sometimes graded, overlie each of these beds. The basal few centimeters of the muddy sandstones frequently consist of a contorted mud-flake breccia derived from the underlying siltstone and is contorted by load structures. Silicified peat, silicified logs, and fossil leaf compressions and impressions have been found in the Buckley Formation at Turbidite Hill and Mount Cerberus and in the Geologists Range and Black Nunataks.

It is located from Alipurduar, the nearest town. The Bhutan King used the fort to protect the portion of famous Silk Route connecting Tibet with India, via Bhutan. Still later during the unrest in the occupation of Tibet, hundreds of refugees arrived at the place and used the then abandoned fort as a place of refuge. History Its origin is uncertain. Before the occupation of the fort by the British, it was a point of contention between the King of Bhutan and the Cooch Kings. =British occupation= The British on invitation of the Cooch King intervened and captured the fort which was formally handed over to the British on November 11, 1865 as part of Treaty of Sinchula. The British reconstructed the fort from its bamboo wood structure to stone structure. The fort was to later be used as a high security prison and detention camp in the 1930s; it was the most notorious and unreachable prison in India after the Cellular Jail in Andaman. Nationalist revolutionaries belonging to the Anushilan Samiti and Yugantar group such as Krishnapada Chakraborty were imprisoned there in the 1930s. Forward Bloc leader and ex-Law Minister of West Bengal, Amar Prasad Chakraborty, was also imprisoned at Buxa Fort in 1943. Besides, some communist revolutionaries and intellectuals like the poet Subhash Mukhopadhyay were imprisoned here in the 1950s. =Tibetan refugee crisis= Drepung was one of the most celebrated monasteries in Tibet, and with over 10,000 monks before the Chinese invasion. But in March 1959, Chinese troops tasked with quelling the Tibetan uprising moved aggressively against the monastery; Only a few hundred monks escaped to India. These expatriate monks, representing all the diverse Tibetan orders, first set up a monastic study center and refugee camp in Buxa Fort, on the grounds of the jungle-bound former prison camp. In 1966, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs was alerted to the conditions of the Buxa refugee camps, and it became apparent that the Tibetan refugees would have to be relocated to a more hospitable place. Initially reluctant, a message from the Dalai Lama, urging them to think of the future and to strive for sufficiency, and the option of settling near other Tibetan refugees convinced the monks to move, and in 1971 the monks moved to their new locations at Bylakuppe and Mundgod in the state of Karnataka. Geography =Location= Buxa Fort is located at . =Area overview= Alipurduar district is covered by two maps. It is an extensive area in the eastern end of the Dooars in West Bengal. It is undulating country, largely forested, with numerous rivers flowing down from the outer ranges of the Himalayas in Bhutan. It is a predominantly rural area with 79.38% of the population living in the rural areas.

Born in Zagreb, Croatia (which was at the time part of Austria-Hungary) Gavella finished high school in his hometown before enrolling at the University of Vienna where he studied philosophy and German studies. He graduated and subsequently earned a doctorate there in 1908, after which he returned to Zagreb. In 1909 he was employed by the National and University Library in Zagreb. He began writing theatre reviews the following year, published in the local German-language daily Agramer Tagblatt, for which he contributed from 1910 to 1918. During this time he was also an active member of the HAŠK sports society, and is known for refereeing the opening match of the first ever Croatian association football league championship in September 1912 played between HŠK Croatia and Tipografski ŠK at HAŠK's ground which later became Maksimir Stadium. In 1914 Gavella began directing at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb (HNK) and in the 1930s his essays on theatre theory were published in several cultural magazines, including the short-lived literary magazine Danas edited by Miroslav Krleža (which was launched in January 1934 in Belgrade and had only five issues before being banned by Yugoslav authorities in May 1934). Gavella had greatly influenced the development of HNK in the following decades as he became director of Drama at the theatre and directed a number of plays and operas and was instrumental in setting up HNK's in-house drama school. His tenure at HNK was also marked by his emphasis on performing plays written by Croatian authors (such as Marin Držić, Ivan Gundulić, Tituš Brezovački, Miroslav Krleža and Milan Begović) along with world-renowned authors (like William Shakespeare, Luigi Pirandello and Richard Wagner). After World War II Gavella spent several years directing in Bratislava, Ostrava and Ljubljana before returning to Zagreb once again in 1949. For his work in Ljubljana (namely, the direction of plays Deep are the Roots by James Gow and Arnaud d'Usseau and A Month in the Country by Ivan Turgenev, and the opera Jenůfa by Leoš Janáček), Gavella was awarded the Prešeren Award, the highest Slovenian prize for artistic achievements, in 1949. Upon returning to Zagreb, he established the Academy of Theatre Arts (, present-day Academy of Dramatic Art) in 1950. Three years later, dissatisfied by the conservative approach to theatre at HNK, Gavella was one of the founders of the alternative Zagreb Drama Theatre in May 1953, which had its first premiere in October 1953 with a production of Golgotha by Miroslav Krleža (the theatre later adopted its current name Gavella Drama Theatre in honor of their founder in 1970). In 1959 he won the inaugural annual Vladimir Nazor Award for achievements in theatre, and was made a member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (the present-day Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in 1961. Gavella died the following year aged 76 and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery. During his career Gavella directed around 270 plays, operas and operettas, and authored a number of essays about Croatian playwrights and poets such as Držić, Mažuranić, Šenoa, Vojnović and Krleža. His writings on the history of Croatian theatre and the theory of theatre were compiled in several books, some of which were published posthumously. He also translated a number of plays and librettos into Croatian (including works such as Shakespeare's Macbeth, which he translated for his 1957 production of the play).

Ludwig von Gerdtell was born into an aristocratic Prussian family, his father and grandfather were officers in the Potsdam Guards Regiment. He did not follow this tradition and studied law, then theology with an emphasis on New Testament Studies. From 1902 to 1908 he worked as a traveling secretary for the German Student Christian Association. In 1908/09 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Erlangen with his work on Rudolf Eucken's position on early Christianity. He came to the conclusion that the statements of the New Testament church and the state disagreed. Between 1905 and 1928 he published six titles in the series Brennende Fragen der Weltanschauung für denkende moderne Menschen (Burning questions for modern- minded people) dealing in a critical manner with dogmas and interpretations. He decided that the church needed reform on the basis of the New Testament and was initially close to the Baptists but broke with them and SCM in the summer of 1909. He continued for a period friendship with Eberhard Arnold in Leipzig.Markus Baum Against the wind: Eberhard Arnold and the Bruderhof 1998 p62, p259 \\"Then, if von Gurten were to be identified as Ludwig von Gerdtell, the episode must have taken place in 1902 ... In any event, the description of \\"von Gurten\\" corresponds in its main characteristics with Ludwig von Gerdtell: \\" Then in 1912 Gerdtell was introduced by a friend in London to the Christadelphians in Birmingham, in particular Professor Thomas Turner, and through him began to associate with the German Christadelphians in Stuttgart and Berlin, from 1912-1930.Bogner, G. Geschichte der Christadelphians in Deutschland (1) \\"In Berlin hatte Bruder Ludwig Knupfer in Gemeinschaft mit Bruder Dr. von Gerdtell eine Gemeinde gegründet. Bruder Knupfer hat durch viele Übersetzungsarbeiten sehr viel an der Schaffung einer christadelphischen Literatur in Deutsch mitgewirkt und viele Jahre lang die Herausgabe einer Monatsschrift zur Verkündigung des biblischen Evangeliums geleitet. Bruder Dr. von Gerdtell war ursprünglich bei der Baptistengemeinde. Sein Studium der Bibel führte ihn jedoch zu Wahrheitserkenntnissen, die dem ursprünglichen Evangelium, wie es die Christadelphians vertreten, entsprechen. Als er diese Erkenntnisse der Baptistengemeinde vortrug, war der Bruch mit ihr unvermeidbar geworden. Er dachte zunächst, mit seiner Erkenntnis in Deutschland allein zu stehen. Er selbst berichtet darüber folgendes: „Ein in London lebender englischer Freund von mir, dem ich mein Neuverständnis des apostolischen Evangeliums im Jahre 1912 mündlich auseinandergesetzt hatte, sagte mir damals, dass ich mit meinen vermeintlich völlig einsam stehenden Überzeugungen keineswegs so allein dastünde, wie ich damals glaubte, sondern dass es in Birmingham, London und an vielen anderen Orten Englands, Amerikas, Afrikas und Australiens Kreise gäbe, welche meine Auffassung des Urchristentums teilten. Unter anderen wurde mir damals auch der Name von Herrn Professor Turner als einer Persönlichkeit genannt, die auf demselben Glaubensstandpunkte wie ich stünde. Diese kurze Mitteilung führte nach Beendigung des Weltkrieges erst zu einer Korrespondenz zwischen Herrn Professor Turner und mir und schließlich zu meiner zweimaligen Einladung nach Birmingham, der ich beide Male Folge gab.” From 1926-1928 the German Christadelphian Albert Maier arranged for Gerdtell to lecture to large audiences in Stuttgart.Gustav Bogner Geschichte der Christadelphians in Deutschland \\"In den Jahren 1926 bis 1928 hielt Bruder Dr. von Gerdtell auf Einladung von Bruder Albert Maier in Esslingen und Stuttgart öffentliche Vorträge. \\" Gerdtell also came into contact with the Disciples of Christ in America and influenced the association.Douglas Allen Foster The encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell movement: Christian Church 2004 Page 310 \\"Some thirty years later this interest in Germany was given new life when an outspoken German theologian from Berlin named Dr. Ludwig von Gerdtell captured attention in America. Shortly thereafter, under the leadership of Dean E. Walker, an organization in the U.S. who wanted to support his efforts. Then Gerdtell increasingly came to associate with the Disciples of Christ. Gerdtell was a staunch opponent of Adolf Hitler's policies from the 1920s spoke more and more openly against the Nazis. In January 1934, he made a comment while shopping at the local tobacco shop at Schöneiche Berlin to the effect that Hitler was synonymous with war. Subsequently, he was denounced by a neighbor. Only because of the courageous intervention of municipal policeman Max Dittrich was it possible for Gerdtell to escape during the night to avoid arrest and the following day. After flight through Switzerland, Italy and England, he arrived in the United States. All his property was confiscated. With the assistance Dean E. Walker he found employment teaching at the Department of Religion of Butler University in Indianapolis. After the Second World War he founded the European Evangelistic Society.

Like his father Count Dracula, Alucard is a vampire, a mythological creature that lives by sucking the life force from living creatures. Alucard was first performed by Lon Chaney Jr. in Son of Dracula and has since been featured in other films, comics, television shows, video games and other forms of media. The name \\"Alucard\\" is \\"Dracula\\" spelled backwards. Creation Alucard was created by Universal Studios' Robert Siodmak and his brother Curt for their 1943 film Son of Dracula. They made the name \\"Alucard\\" by spelling \\"Dracula\\" backward. Son of Dracula is the third film in Universal's Dracula trilogy, preceded by Dracula (1931) and Dracula's Daughter (1936). Like Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Wolf Man, it is an example of a monster movie with no novelization history. In Son of Dracula Alucard is the first son of Count Dracula, King of the Vampires, and is \\"Prince of Vampires\\", later revealed to be Dracula himself. At the beginning of the film, Alucard is a middle-aged man who is invited to the US, where he meets Katherine Caldwell, a woman who secretly dates and marries him. However, when her jealous boyfriend, Frank Stanley, attempts to kill Alucard, the bullets pass through him and hit Katherine. News of the incident reach Professor Lazlo, who suspects that this may be a case of vampirism. Meanwhile, Alucard turns Katherine into a vampire. When confronted, Katherine says that she still loves Frank but wanted immortality, and tells him how to destroy Alucard. Frank sets Alucard's coffin on fire, killing him. Since Son of Dracula, the character has not appeared in a Universal film. In other media * Alucard appears in the 1967 film Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horrors. * Although Alucard wasn't mentioned by name, he appears as Count Dracula's son in Mad Mad Mad Monsters. Here, however, he is called \\"Boobula\\". Count Dracula's son was with his father when Baron Henry von Frankenstein invites them to the wedding of the Monster and his Bride at the Transylvania Astoria Hotel. * In the Hammer film Dracula A.D. 1972, Dracula’s present day servant uses the surname Alucard. * Alucard is a central character in some of the Castlevania video games by Konami. His first appearance in the game series was in the 1989 prequel Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse as he teams up with Trevor Belmont to stop Dracula. Alucard also appears in the 1997 game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night as the main playable character. In Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow he appears under the guise of \\"Genya Arikado\\", an enigmatic government agent. In the Lords of Shadow saga, he appears as a playable character in Mirror of Fate, where he and Trevor are effectively merged into a single being, and reappears in Lords of Shadow 2 as an ally. Alucard continues to appear in various games under the Castlevania label. * Alucard is the protagonist in the Hellsing manga and anime series created by Kouta Hirano. He is not the son of Dracula, but rather both Count Dracula of Bram Stoker's novel as well as Vlad III Tepes of Wallachia. * Alucard is the name of a vampire who began to absorb other monsters to become a nearly-unkillable demon in the manga Rosario + Vampire by Akihisa Ikeda. * Herschell Gordon Lewis' movie A Taste of Blood is also known as \\"The Secret of Dr. Alucard\\", although it does not feature any character named Alucard. * Alucard is the male protagonist in Master of Mosquiton, an anime predating Hellsing, where he is awoken by the blood of Inaho, making her his master. The OAV set & the TV Series depict his personality very differently. *In Batman v.

It is administered via subcutaneous injection once daily to help control the blood sugar level of those with diabetes. It has a duration of action that lasts up to 42 hours (compared to 18 to 26 hours provided by other marketed long-acting insulins such as insulin glargine and insulin detemir), making it a once-daily basal insulin, that is one that provides a base insulin level, as opposed to the fast- and short-acting bolus insulins. Insulin degludec is a modified insulin that has one single amino acid deleted in comparison to human insulin, and is conjugated to hexadecanedioic acid via gamma-L-glutamyl spacer at the amino acid lysine at position B29. In 2017, it was the 265th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Side effects A significant side effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia. A meta-analysis of clinical trials published in July 2012 found 39 to 47.9 events of hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose <56 mg/dL) per patient year, with higher rates in the more concentrated degludec formulation. Rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia ranged from 3.7 to 5.1 events per patient year. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Insulin degludec is an ultra-long acting insulin that, unlike insulin glargine, is active at a physiologic pH. The addition of hexadecanedioic acid to lysine at the B29 position allows for the formation of multi-hexamers in subcutaneous tissues. This allows for the formation of a subcutaneous depot that results in slow insulin release into the systemic circulation. =Pharmacokinetics= Insulin degludec has an onset of action of 30–90 minutes (similar to insulin glargine and insulin detemir). There is no peak in activity, due to the slow release into systemic circulation. The duration of action of insulin degludec is reported as being longer than 24 hours. When taken at the same time of day, this long (but under 48 hour) duration can result in an overlap from one dose to the next, resulting in greater insulin action then. if the overlap should be during sleep, there is a risk of lower blood sugar, so it is important to dose in the morning so that the overlap will be when users are eating and otherwise checking their blood sugar. The dose should be titrated during this overlap period as well. Effectiveness profile Studies have shown that patients taking insulin degludec needed to take significantly smaller doses of basal insulin than those taking insulin glargine U100, while achieving similar blood glucose levels. Insulin degludec also has the ability to be mixed with other insulins, thereby improving glycemic control. This cannot be done using current long-acting insulins. A physician involved in the trials was quoted as saying, > This allows the creation of a novel formulation that retains the smooth > control of a long-acting basal with rapid-acting mealtime control from > insulin aspart. This 2-component insulin retains the ultralow risk > characteristics of degludec with simultaneous mealtime coverage. History Insulin degludec has been filed for registration in the United States. Novo Nordisk hopes to begin marketing the insulin analog in 2015 or 2016 after the completion of additional cardiac safety studies requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2013. Insulin degludec received FDA approval 25 September 2015 and marketing began on 26 January 2016. Clinical trial data =Type 1 diabetes mellitus= Insulin degludec was studied as an alternative to insulin glargine as part of a basal-bolus regimen in the BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1 trial. 629 patients with type 1 diabetes were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either insulin degludec (n=472) or insulin glargine (n=157) in addition to mealtime insulin aspart. Patients in the degludec treatment arm were switched from their basal insulin to insulin degludec in a 1:1 ratio, with a 20-30% dose reduction in patients receiving multiple basal doses per day. After 52 weeks, patients treated with insulin degludec produced a similar reduction in HbA1c (0.40% vs. 0.39%) meeting the criteria for noninferiority. Adverse events were similar in the two treatment arms; however, rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia (between midnight and 6am) were 27% lower in patients treated with insulin degludec (3.91 vs. 5.22%,p=0.024). The reduction in the incidence of hypoglycemia was seen as a therapeutic benefit, as hypoglycemia is often a dose limiting toxicity in insulin therapy. =Type 2 diabetes mellitus= In the BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 2 trial, insulin degludec was studied as an alternative to insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 995 patients were randomized to receive either insulin degludec (n=755) or insulin glargine (n=251), in addition to either mealtime insulin aspart, metformin, and/or pioglitazone. Patients in this trial had an average HbA1c of 8.3–8.4%, and 49–50% were on a regimen consisting of basal-bolus insulin plus oral antidiabetic medications. After 52 weeks, insulin degludec was found to be noninferior to insulin glargine, providing a similar HbA1c lowering effect (−1.10 vs. −1.18%). Overall rates of hypoglycemia were significantly lower with insulin degludec (11.09 vs. 13.63%/yr, p=0.0359), including cases of nocturnal hypoglycemia (1.39 vs. 1.84%/yr, p=0.0399). Pharmacoeconomics Given the treat-to-target nature of the BEGIN trial program, much of the health economic analysis of insulin degludec has focussed on short-term cost-effectiveness based on differences in insulin dosing and hypoglycemic event incidence rather than differences in glycemic control. The first cost-effectiveness analysis of this nature was conducted from a societal perspective in the Swedish setting in 2013, finding that insulin degludec would be cost-effective relative to insulin glargine in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes as part of either a basal or basal-insulin regimen.

Role in starting WWF Victor Stolan, born 1893 in Czechoslovakia,BRITISH COMMITTEE FOR REFUGEES FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND CZECH REFUGEE TRUST FUND DOCUMENTS AT THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE wrote to Julian Huxley, the author of three articles about the disappearance of wild life in Africa that first appeared on 13 November 1960 in The Observer with \\"The germ of the idea that was to result in the birth of the World Wildlife Fund\\". In this letter, dated 6 December 1960, Stolan argued that an international appeal aiming to raise millions of pounds should be set up on behalf of all wild species threatened by extinction. It \\"urged Huxley to put him in touch with a \\"single and uninhibited mind… with whom ideas can be developed and speedilly [sic] directed towards accumulating some millions of pounds without mobilising commissions, committees etc as there is no time for Victorian procedure\\". Huxley responded by putting him in contact with Max Nicholson who saw the logic of his argument and encouraged Victor to write a memorandum about setting up such a fund. This memorandum has been described as \\"brilliant, lengthy and eccentric\\". It argued that help should be sought from the Pope and Archbishop of Canterbury: \\"Nobody is in too high a place to lend a hand to defend creation.\\" He also argued that \\"new tycoons\\" be asked for money to create a \\"shining monument in history\\". Nicholson checked the plausibility of setting up such a fund by showing the memorandum to Guy Mountfort, the head of a major advertising agency. This was, as \\"Nicholson later acknowledged, a turning point. As a result, in May 1961, a meeting was held that included Peter Scott (the WWF's first chairman) as well as the three initiators. Exclusion In the spring and summer of 1961 there were more meetings but Victor Stolan came to be excluded from them. In a letter to Huxley, Nicholson wrote, \\"Mr Stolan is rather too much the naive enthusiast and rather too little the practical man of affairs to be very much help,\\" Stolan's history as an hotelier was also counted against him: \\"an unfortunate experience with a country hotel\\". Nicholson also made prejudicial remarks about his Czechoslovakian background. Another factor could have been that unlike all the other founders of the WWF, Stolan was not like them an ornithologist nor earlier involved in conservationism. Victor Stolan died within a few years of the founding of the WWF.

He had once been a Methodist, but had become disillusioned with religion. His Christadelphian employer in Oregon [Thomas Rogers], observed him distributing atheistic literature, signed ‘a seeker after Truth’ and invited him to his home, and they spent long hours discussing the Bible. Alb ert Maier listened attentively and knew he had found what he was looking for. He was baptized by Bro. Rogers in November 1885.” 1 Owen, Stanley Into All the World, p.33, Crowmell Press, Trowbridge UK, 1998 (self- published by the author) 1 . Maier returned to Obertürkheim in Stuttgart in the mid-1890s with the intention of preaching there, but found little interest so sold his house and prepared with his mother to emigrate permanently. He left two converts: 27-year-old Friedrich Weber (30 April 1899) and, in Schmalkalden near Kassel, Henriette Britzius, who with her husband emigrated to Birmingham, England and remained a bridge between British and German Christadelphians into her old age. Following the death of his mother in the USA, Maier returned to Germany, carrying his own translations of booklets by John Thomas and Robert Roberts, and Thomas Williams' book „Der Welt Erlösung” translated by A. H. Zilmer and Johann G. Miller. With materials in German, and the help of Weber, Maier was more successful. He founded the first Urchristen Gemeinde in Kornwestheim and in Stuttgart-Gaisburg. After the First World War in 1922 Maier met Johannes Reich a preacher of the Neuapostolische Gemeinde, and Reich and most of his congregation were rebaptised. New Gemeinde appeared in Nufringen, Reutlingen, Pfullingen, Ludwigsburg und Kirchheim am Neckar.Bogner \\"An verschiedenen Orten in Deutschland entstanden auch kleinere Gruppen, z.B. in Nufringen, Reutlingen, Pfullingen, Ludwigsburg und Kirchheim a. N. Bei den erstgenannten Gruppen war der tragende Geist Bruder Albert Maier und in Kirchheim a. N. Bruder Johannes Reich.\\" At the same time Ludwig von Gerdtell, who had made direct contact with Professor Thomas Turner of the English Fraternal Visitor magazine, was leading a Gemeinde in Berlin with the Christadelphian Ludwig Knupfer. Gerdtell was originally with the Baptists, and for a time would be with the Christadelphians, though following his outspoken engagement in politics - and the reporting of a statement made in a local grocer's shop in 1934 that \\"Hitler is synonymous with war\\",German Wikipedia sources: Im Januar 1934 äußerte er sich beim Einkaufen im örtlichen Tabakladen von Schöneiche bei Berlin dahingehend, dass Hitler gleichbedeutend mit Krieg sei. he had to flee via Spain to America. Maier was more circumspect. Although the Christadelphians were suspect for their pacifism, and pro-Jewish interpretations of prophecy, Maier maintained a \\"strangers and pilgrims\\" attitude to Germany's politics, with the result that most of the Christadelphians avoided arrest until war broke out and conscription was introduced; several were imprisoned and Albert Merz was executed in April 1941.Botten, J.

Also used as anti-aircraft ships, the Sperrbrecher suffered heavy losses in the war. Operational history Sperrbrecher were used extensively by the Germans in World War I. The Imperial Fleet had a total of thirty Sperrbrecher for clearing mine streets – eight were lost during the war. Some of these ships were equipped with airplanes, such as Rio Negro, Plauen or Wigbert. In World War II officially designated as 'Special Purpose Merchant Ships', although termed by the Royal Air Force as Heavy Flak Ships,Paterson 2004, p. 165. the Sperrbrecher were converted from merchant ships for their special role, were primarily crewed by merchant seamen. Often their cargo holds were filled with buoyant material to aid in flotation in case of hitting a mine and the bows were strengthened. Ships converted to the Sperrbrecher type were usually fitted with heavy anti-aircraft armament and often carried barrage balloons. The primary use of the Sperrbrecher was to escort other vessels through cleared paths in defensive minefields, for the purpose of detonating any mines that might have strayed into the passageways.Williamson 2009, p. 19. The ships of the Sperrbrecher type were, early in the war, used to clear suspected enemy minefields by simply sailing through them. Even with the strengthened hull and buoyant material the ships suffered heavy losses and with the advent of acoustically and magnetically fused mines, they became ineffective.Paterson 2004, pp. 164–165. Later in the war the Sperrbrecher type ships were used to escort U-boats in and out of harbour. Due to their capable dual purpose armament and respectable fire control a Sperrbrecher was also an able surface combatant, significant enough to deter a RN escort destroyer from engaging for fear of receiving \\"a bloody nose\\". To counter newer, magnetically fused mines, some ships of the Sperrbrecher type were equipped with a large electromagnet in their bows.Ridley 2006, p. 14. Referred to as the VES system, this was to detonate magnetic mines well clear of the vessel, the design specifications calling for a distance of from the hull at detonation.Breyer 1994. Careful military intelligence work by the Royal Navy resulted in a method to defeat this method of minesweeping, sinking several Sperrbrecher through the careful fusing of mines laid as traps, their fuses desensitised to be activated only when the sweeping vessel was directly above them.Ridley 2006, pp. 14–15. Over one hundred vessels, mostly merchant ships of around and larger displacement, were converted as Sperrbrecher and it is estimated that around 50 percent of the vessels converted were lost during the war. During World War II only one commander received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for services on a Sperrbrecher. Korvettenkapitän of the Reserves Karl Palmgreen received the award on 3 August 1941 as commander of Sperrbrecher IX and I.Fellgiebel 2000, p. 332. After the war some Sperrbrecher were converted back to merchant duties, a number remaining in service until the 1970s.

Plot In 2010, two Japanese Americans lon \\"HIRAMATSU FARM\\", Jiro Hiramatsu (Tsunehiko Kamijo) and his late older brother's wife Shinobu Hiramatsu (Kaoru Yachigusa) were watching Ichiro Suzuki play baseball at the stadium in Seattle. They were invited to meet their younger sister who was separated from the family in 1940, Sachi Ota (Meguko Kishi). Sachi's daughter-in-law, Keiko Ota (Keiko Horiuchi) made the case that Sachi will be able to meet Jiro and Shinobu for the first time in seventy years. Firstly, Sachi rejected meeting her family living in the U.S. again, because she was thinking that she and her late older sister were cast out from her parents. However, Sachi wanted to meet Jiro and Shinobu because of her having the operation for breast cancer. Sachi hadn't told her grandchild and Keiko's son Naoto Ota (Tsubasa Kato) who is a fan of the baseball player Ichiro Suzuki that she was born and raised in the U.S. Japanese Americans tells the story of a family of Japanese immigrants who moved to the United States. In 1912, the end of the Meiji period, Chokichi Hiramatsu (younger role: Tsuyoshi Kusanagi) moved to the United States with Kazuma Nonaka (Ukon Ichikawa), his wife Kinue Nonaka (Yo Yoshida) and two children because of poverty. However, anti-Japanese immigrants sentiment and believing the Yellow Peril was raising in the U.S., because of not only the characteristics of Japanese immigrants like working too much and having many children but also the Japanese victory over the Russo-Japanese War. Chokichi worked at the canning factory introduced by Isamu Okada (Nenji Kobayashi) who is a relative man of Nonaka, but he resigned that and worked various farmlands as a day laborer during seven years in order to send his salaries to his family living in Shimane. Later, he married Tomo Murakami (younger role: Ayako Imoto) who came from Niimi, Okayama recommended by Nonaka who had run a laundry in Seattle with his wife and children after giving up farming. Properly speaking, her elder sister intended to marry Chokichi, but she moved to Tokyo with her partner, so Tomo married Chokichi as her elder sister's substitute. Chokichi and Tomo were given vast farmland by the American elderly woman whom a son lives in New York because her only son wouldn't become a farmer. However, Chokichi and Tomo who were Issei couple couldn't get U.S. nationality. They had first boy, Nisei child who could acquire the citizenship of the United States and they also wanted their first son to become a Japanese American man like a bridge between both countries Japan and the U.S. Chokichi Hiramatsu (older role: Kiichi Nakai) and his wife Tomo Hiramatsu (older role: Pinko Izumi) had four children who could acquire the U.S. nationality as Nisei, two sons and two daughters, first son Ichiro Hiramatsu (double role: Tsuyoshi Kusanagi), second son Jiro Hiramatsu (Kenichi Matsuyama), first daughter Shizu Hiramatsu (Saki Terashima), second daughter Sachi Hiramatsu (Umika Kawashima). Ichiro had studying the law at the university to become a lawyer who helps Japanese Americans who are discriminated against by white Americans. He met Japan's consular official's daughter Shinobu Matsuzawa (Yukie Nakama) there. Chokichi made his two daughters Shizu and Sachi go back to his home in Shimane, Japan, but Chokichi's older brother Ryosuke Hiramatsu (Toranosuke Kato) sent Shizu to her aunt Fusa (Eri Fuse) living in Hiroshima, he also sent Sachi to her aunt Toki (Kaoru Sugita) living in Okinawa separately from each other. When the war between Japan and the U.S. broke out, Shizu and Sachi were bullied by the school's students and their aunt's family, being told to \\"Go Back To America !\\" because of the enemy country's persons. Shinobu's father consular official Matsuzawa was ordered to return Japan from the consulate in the US, but Shinobu ran away from the Japan-US exchange ship, swimming in the sea because she loved Ichiro and wanted to marry him, she engaged in the hard work of farming to become Ichiro's wife. Ichiro's mother Tomo allowed that, but Ichiro's father Chokichi didn't firstly. When the attack on Pearl Harbor (Pacific War) broke out on 7 December 1941, Chokichi was arrested by the FBI as an enemy alien. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the policy of the internment of Japanese Americans living in the West Coast, not only Issei who couldn't acquire the United States nationality but also Nisei who obtained the U.S. citizenship, Japanese Americans encountered racism against Japanese diasporas and segregation. Tomo, Jiro, Ichiro and Shinobu were confined in the Manzanar internment camp, they shared one room with a gardener in California Daisuke Komiya (Takashi Sasano) and his son Hiroshi Komiya (Akiyoshi Nakao). Japanese Americans in the internment camps managed the environment of living like the toilets, the cafeterias, the schools and the farmland themselves. The U.S. government asked two main questions so-called the 'Loyalty Registration', the Question #27 asked: \\"Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty wherever ordered?\\" and Question #28 asked: \\"Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America and faithfully defend the United States from any or all attack by foreign or domestic forces, and forswear any form of allegiance or obedience to the Japanese emperor, or any other foreign government, power, or organization?\\", for Japanese Americans in order to send them to the front in the WWII because of the shortage of the soldiers. Tomo wanted her children, especially Ichiro to answer \\"No\\" and \\"No\\". However, not only Tomo but also Jiro, Ichiro and Shinobu answered \\"Yes\\" and \\"Yes\\". Ichiro joined the 442nd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army to live as Americans. After starting of his military exercises, Chokichi was discharged and sent his family confined in Manzanar. Daisuke Komiya and Nonaka couple were sent to the Tule Lake Segregation Center and were deported to Japan because they answered \\"No\\" and \\"No\\". Ichiro was killed in the Vosges Mountains, France, Western Front of the European theatre of World War II as a soldier of the 442nd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army. He received the Bronze Star Medal after his death in the battle. Shinobu had given birth of a boy Ken Hiramatsu, but Ken had never seen his father Ichiro. In the ending of WWII, Sachi experienced the Battle of Okinawa as the member of the girls students' nursing. After the suicide of the General of the Imperial Japanese Army Mitsuru Ushijima, she was helped by Hiroshi Komiya who was a translator in Okinawa and the Corporal of the United States Marine Corps.

The University was created in 1900 and the department founded in 1902.University of Birmingham, The School of Metallurgy and Materials: 'Our history' He was instrumental in the early development of the sclerometer for testing hardness of metals. He retired in 1926. He was also a leading member of the Christadelphian church. Turner was born in Ladywood, Birmingham in 1861. He married Christian Smith of Edinburgh in 1887 and had two sons and two daughters. He studied metallurgy at the Royal School of Mines in London, and won the annual De la Beche medal awarded in memory of the school's founder. Turner was demonstrator at Mason Science College from 1883, then 1887 lecturer in metallurgy, a new science that \\"was to develop greatly under his guidance during the next forty years.\\" From 1894-1902 he was Director of Technical Instruction to Staffordshire County Council, but in 1902 was chosen as the first Professor of Metallurgy in the newly established University of Birmingham. He retired in 1926 but continued to publish and lecture. His most notable work was seminal research in the influence of silicon in cast iron. He was a founder member of, and later president of the Institute of Metals, vice president of the Iron and Steel Institute, and on the Advisory Committee of the Imperial Institute. He was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1925.

Municipal Museum Kampen) is a museum situated in the Old Town HallSite Stedelijk Museum Kampen of Kampen. The collection has four main topics: water, religion, justice and the House of Orange-Nassau. There are also five to six temporary exhibitions on contemporary art a year.  History of the Old Town Hall  =Exterior= The original Old Town Hall dates from around 1350. Here, from the Middle Ages until the French occupation justice was spoken by magistrates and councils. The building was built in the Lower Rhine Gothic-style so characteristic of the German Hanseatic towns: a rectangular shape, simple decorations and windows in arch niches. The building stood free with an entrance on the south side. This entrance is now closed by the construction of the New Town Hall next to it. On the south side was also the landing from which the city government announced decisions and where criminals were presented to the people. =Fire= During the night of February 4 to 5, 1543 the Old Town Hall burned out. Only the outer walls, vaults and a portion of the floor remained intact, but badly battered. Very soon the rebuilding began and one year later the exterior was finished. From that moment on the Old Town Hall has two different architectural styles: the aspiring lines of the late Gothic mingle with the horizontal lines that are typical of the Renaissance. The decorations are made in stone. The images on the west facade were created by the Amsterdam sculptor J. Polet jr. and date from the thirties of the 20th century. They replace the badly damaged medieval images that are currently in the Koornmarkt gate on display. From left to right, they suggest: Charlemagne, Alexander the Great, Temperance, Faith, Justice and Charitas.  Collection  The permanent collection of the Stedelijk Museum Kampen has four main topics: water, religion, justice and the House of Orange. There are also five to six temporary exhibitions on contemporary art a year. = Water = Kampen became rich through the water. The water made trade possible to faraway places, where a lot of money was earned. But water also provided a threat. In the rooms with the topic 'Water', the history of Kampen and the water is shown. The old Hanseatic League, the rise and fall of the Hanseatic city, the sea level rise in our times; Kampen living with water. = Religion = Religion has always been very present in Kampen. Until the Reformation Kampen was a Roman Catholic town. There were large churches and monasteries in the old town. After the Reformation Kampen became Protestant and two theological universities were founded. Much has been preserved from this period. This can be seen in the rooms with the theme 'Religion'. = Justice = Early in the Middle Ages Kampen obtains city rights. From the Schepenzaal (The Alderman Hall) the city was governed and justice was spoken. This old hall of 1545 is the showpiece of the museum. The hall has been unchanged for over hundreds of years and can be visited. The museum rooms on 'Governance' and 'Justice' show how Government and Justice worked in those early days. = House of Orange-Nassau = The Stedelijk Museum Kampen has painted portraits of all the rulers and kings from the House of Orange-Nassau. The members of the House of Orange-Nassau are all painted in full length, from head to toe.  The use of Multimedia  With a handheld computer and headphones you can make a journey through time and visit the collection. Voices and images of Kampen tell the story of the city. The tour is currently available for adults in Dutch. The Stedelijk museum also provides a tour which takes you outside past historical places and events in the city during one and a half hour. The display shows historic photographs and video of the place where you are situated at that moment. A comprehensive explanation is given by well known inhabitants. Modern technology and history make it possible to show the city in the museum and the museum in the city. By using the multimedia tour visitors can not only enjoy inside, but also outside the city's colorful history. As one of the first museums in the Netherlands the Stedelijk Museum Kampen uses this kind of multimedia tour.

Other versions describe the Guiana Shield separated from the Amazonian Shield by a depression, and the Saharan Metacraton as a part of this West African Craton. The São Francisco Craton is an ancient craton in the eastern part of South America. The craton crops out in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Bahia. It includes a number of blocks of Archean basement, separated by orogenic belts. The belts are characterized by sedimentary basins and passive continental margins containing granite intrusions. The Paleoproterozoic (about 2.5 to 2.0 Ga) was the source of orogenic belts and the current configuration of the craton. The São Francisco Craton around 1.0 Ga ago was in the south of the supercontinent Rodinia, and after the fragmentation of Rodinia in the late Proterozoic (700 Ma) became a member of the supercontinent Gondwana until it fragmented in the Jurassic (about 180 Ma). The subsequent opening of the Atlantic Ocean left Southern Africa in the Congo Craton and the São Francisco block in South America. The ancient Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts of the São Francisco Craton contain many economically important minerals, particularly those containing iron (as in the Iron Quadrangle) and gold, and are a major source of income for the mining industry in Brazil.

According to the genealogy of the Takeda clan, Yonekura Nobutsugu descended from Minamoto no Kiyomitsu, also called Takeda Kiyomitsu. In the late Heian period, he settled in Koiwasuji Yonekura, Yatsushiro district, Kai Province and called himself 'Yonekura'. According to \\"Koyo Gunkan\\" (record of the military exploits of the Takeda family), Yonekura Shigetsugu was the 'Ashigaru Taisho' (General of the Foot Soldiers), and he died at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. Yonekura Harutsugu was the eldest son of Shigetsugu. He was given the character of 'Haru' by Takeda Harunobu (Shingen). On April 28, 1569, he died at the second Battle of Satta Toge. Yonekura Tadatsugu succeeded the family estate after the death of his elder brother Harutsugu. He was the leader of the Mukawashu warriors troop. When the Takeda clan was destroyed in 1582, Oda Nobunaga prohibited the former retainers of the Takeda clan from being employed by him, so he hid his younger brothers in Kiriyama, Totomi Province on the advice of Tokugawa Ieyasu. In the same year, when the Tenshojingo War broke out, he was recruited by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and played an active role in the battle against the Hojo clan. In 1584, he received a property in Kai province, and after the Battle of Ueda (1585) he was given additional properties, and in 1590, he was transferred to Hachigata (Musashi Province). Yonekura Yoshitsugu died at the Siege of Osaka. (1637–1699) was favored by Shōgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, and rose rapidly through the ranks until he reached the post of Wakadoshiyori in 1696. The additional revenues provided by this office qualified him to join ranks of the Daimyō, and he became the first lord of Kanazawa Domain in Musashi Province. He was subsequently transferred to Minagawa Domain in Kōzuke Province. His line died out with his grandson (1683-1712), but a son of his relative Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, descending from the Takeda and the Mukawashu, was selected to inherit the family name, taking the name Yonekura Tadasuke and was transferred back to Musashi-Kanazawa Domain in 1722. During the Bakumatsu period, the 8th (and final) Daimyō, Yonekura Masakoto, sided with the new Meiji government in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration. After the abolition of the han system, he became a viscount (shishaku) under the kazoku peerage system. References * Papinot, Edmond. (1906) Dictionnaire d'histoire et de géographie du japon.

The site is located approximately 2 kilometres from Melbourne’s Central Business District. The complex opened in 2004 and its primary function is to support Victoria's film and television industry and attract international and Australian productions to Melbourne. It is one of three major studios in Australia, the others being Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast and Fox Studios Australia in Sydney. The facility is in an expansion phase, with construction to begin in late 2020 on a super stage (Stage 6) that will be comparable to the largest stages in the Southern Hemisphere. Background The push for Melbourne to build a major studio complex arose in the late 1990s amid concern that it was \\"losing some of its media city position to arch-rival Sydney and to the Gold Coast\\". The strategic objectives were that construction of a major studio complex would represent Melbourne's maturity and global ambitions, develop production capacity to its next stage, and service the needs of the local film and television industry. At the time, Melbourne had a number of smaller facilities with sound stages, but did not have a large state-of-the-art complex. History Construction began in 2003 on a parcel of land provided by the Victorian government in the Docklands precinct. The studios were a partnership between the Victorian government and a private consortium, Central City Studio Holdings. The complex opened in April 2004 under the name Melbourne Central City Studios and that year hosted the Australian feature film production, Hating Alison Ashley. In 2005, the American-backed Ghost Rider became the first international production at the studios and, with a budget of around $120 million, was the biggest feature film ever to be made in Victoria. However, the number of international productions in the first few years of operation did not live up to expectations, partly because of the fluctuating Australian dollar. In 2008 the private consortium withdrew and the Victorian government took control of the facility. In 2009 the Victorian government and the studios commissioned the 'Future Directions' study, which reaffirmed the government's commitment to retaining ownership of the facility and led to a $10 million infrastructure upgrade. In October 2010 the complex changed its name to Docklands Studios Melbourne, formally adopting the name by which the studios were commonly known. In the same year, the Nine Network announced plans to relocate its television production to Docklands Studios, following the closure of its outmoded facility in Bendigo Street, Richmond. =Recent history= Docklands Studios Melbourne is used by domestic and international productions of all sizes. In recent years its five stages have housed Australian feature films such as The Dressmaker and Winchester, small screen projects Millionaire Hot Seat and Dancing With the Stars, and international productions Upgrade, The Whistleblower, and Preacher (Season 4). Many films have used the complex as a production base while shooting on location, including Lion, Ride Like a Girl, and True History of the Kelly Gang. In August 2019 it was revealed that two major TV series, Shantaram for Apple TV and Clickbait for Netflix would be filmed at the studios. In October 2019 it was announced that Dick Cook Studios, founded by former Walt Disney chairman Dick Cook, would set up its Asia-Pacific production base at the lot. Its first two projects are a film based on the Ranger's Apprentice book series by Australian author John Flanagan, and The Alchemyst, based on The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel by Irish author Michael Scott. At the same time the Victorian Government unveiled plans to build a super stage at the complex, to allow the studios to host large-scale blockbusters while still providing world-class facilities for smaller TV and film projects. The $46 million stage is expected to be open for business in late 2021. Since 2009 the CEO of the complex has been former film producer and former Fox Studios Australia Director of Operations, Rod Allan. Facilities The studio complex consists of five sound stages with a total area of 6,318 m² (68,000 square feet), various production offices, a workshop divided into bays of different sizes and parking for 800 vehicles.

Though he played other matches for Glamorgan's second eleven, he made only one further first-class appearance in a single match in 1936.

Gabi (born 10 December 2005), also known as Boon- Chooi, is the first elephant conceived in Israel through artificial insemination. His 6-hour birth was viewed by over 350,000 people in 108 countries via live web streaming on the website of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, which coordinated the pregnancy and birth through its elephant artificial insemination program. Background The Asian Elephant enclosure at the zoo was constructed in 1993 with the help of Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek's Jerusalem Foundation, which also raised funds to bring in female Asian elephants from Thailand at a cost of $50,000 apiece. The zoo obtained its bull elephant as a 5-year-old in September 2001 from the Ramat Gan Safari. The zoo named its bull elephant \\"Teddy,\\" and one of its female elephants, \\"Tamar,\\" in honor of the mayor and his wife. However, attempts to mate Teddy with the female elephants did not produce a natural birth. After years of research and in response to requests by other organizations for the zoo to take part in a trial, Dr. Gabi Eshkar, chief veterinarian of the zoo, initiated the elephant artificial insemination project. Tamar was selected for the project and her reproductive cycle was closely monitored. When the timing was right, sperm was obtained from Emmett, a bull elephant living in the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, England, and flown to Israel on dry ice. The pregnancy was achieved after four tries over two years. The project was carried out in conjunction with a team from the Reproduction Management Institute for Zoo Biology and Wildlife Research of Berlin. At age 20 Tamar was considered a high-risk pregnancy case, as elephants normally begin conceiving between the ages of 12 and 15, and this was Tamar's first pregnancy. Throughout the 21-month pregnancy, dozens of ultrasounds were taken of the elephant's long reproductive system; some of these ultrasounds were published on the zoo's website to whet public interest. Physicians at the obstetrics and gynecology department of Hadassah Medical Center analyzed blood samples to monitor the pregnancy and predict the onset of labor, which they pinpointed to the day. Birth and early life The year-old Gabi (left) with his mother Tamar in the elephant enclosure, January 2007. The birth of Gabi was viewed by over 350,000 people in 108 countries via live web streaming on the zoo's website. The veterinarians halted the webcast at the 4-hour mark, fearing complications from labor. After consulting with two overseas veterinarians and a gynecologist in Israel, the zoo's head veterinarian gave Tamar a calcium injection, massaged her body, and tied down her leg to speed up the birth. Two hours later, Gabi was born. The calf, weighing in at , was born at 6:10 a.m. on Saturday, 10 December 2005. Concerns that Tamar, who was raised in captivity, would not bond with her calf proved groundless. Right after the birth, veterinarians wrapped the newborn calf in towels and sawdust to warm him, and then handed him over to his mother, who nursed him. Zookeepers named the baby elephant after Dr. Gabi Eshkar, who had been killed in a traffic accident in 2004. Gabi was an instant hit with zoo visitors. His playful and energetic nature made him one of the zoo's main attractions. Always on the go, his keepers found him hard to pin down for weigh-ins, and he often acted up while the other elephants were going about their daily routine. On 15 December 2006 the zoo held a first-birthday party for Gabi, complete with balloons and presents for visitors and a birthday cake for Gabi prepared by professional chefs at the Tadmor School for Hotel Management. Move to Turkey Gabi (left) and Tamar, October 2009. Gabi lived in the same enclosure with his mother Tamar and the zoo's three other female elephants for nearly 5 years. By 2010, however, Gabi was growing increasingly aggressive and anti-social -- typical behavior for a 5-year-old bull elephant. The zoo decided to send him to the Gaziantep Zoo in Turkey, where it is hoped he will sire his own offspring and thereby increase the number of Asian elephants in captivity. For several months before the move, zookeepers trained Gabi to enter and remain inside the special cage built for the sea voyage. On Sunday night, 3 October 2010, Gabi was sent by truck to the Port of Haifa, where he was joined by two other Asian Elephants, a hippopotamus, zebras and several lemurs from the Ramat Gan Safari. On October 4, the entire group was shipped to Turkey. The animals arrived the next day and were sent by truck to Gaziantep. Gabi and the other two elephants are the first elephants at the Gaziantep Zoo. Other fertilization attempts In 2007, the Jerusalem Zoo successfully impregnated another of its female elephants, Abigail. In July 2009, however, the 32-year- old elephant and her unborn calf died during complications from labor.

It produces over 26 million ounces and sells over 29 million ounces of silver mined by other companies (including Barrick Gold and Goldcorp) as a by-product of their main operations. In 2016 Silver Wheaton reported attributable production totaling 30.4 million ounces of and 353,700 ounces of . The Company also reported record silver and gold sales for the year, generating net earnings of US$195 million on operating cash flows of $584 million. In Q1 2017 Silver Wheaton reported attributable production totaling 6.5 million ounces of silver and 84,900 ounces of gold, equal to 12.5 million silver equivalent ounces. The Company reported net earnings for the quarter of $61 million or $0.14 per share. On May 10, 2017, Silver Wheaton says shareholders approved a company name change to Wheaton Precious Metals, effective immediately. History Silver Wheaton was established in 2004. It was previously controlled by Goldcorp until December 7, 2006 when Goldcorp's sale of 18 million shares reduced its ownership to 48%. On February 14, 2008 Goldcorp divested itself completely of Silver Wheaton, selling 108 million shares for C$1.566 billion. Silverstone Resources, acquired in 2009 previously traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol SST (delisted May 25, 2009 just after the takeover) as a Tier 1 stock (the exchange's premier tier). Contracts Although most agreements it makes are short-term contracts, at least one with the Penasquito mine in Mexico lasts the length of the mine's life. Until the third quarter of 2012 all of the gold it sold came from the Minto Mine in the Yukon, acquired in mid-2009 following the Cdn $190 million acquisition of Silverstone Resources Corp. In 3q2012 it started receiving gold from HudBay's 777 polymetallic mine in Manitoba . In 2013 it began receiving gold from 3 new mines: Sudbury (33,000 oz), Salobo (29,100 oz), and Constancia. Average realized price for gold produced at 777 was $1390 which is similar to Minto however, average realized cash cost is 32% higher at mine 777 ($400 vs $303). In total, there are 15 agreements with 11 different companies; being able to pay a large portion of the contract price in cash initially, and having already developed extensive relationships with mining companies, helps it gain access to the commodity. In 2013 the average price paid per ounce of pure silver was $4.12 up from $4.06, $3.99, $3.97 in 2012, 2011, 2010. Penasquito (one of the largest silver deposits in the world, Silver Wheaton's 25% interest would rank in the top 25 silver mines in the world) will give the company an average of 7 million ounces annually for 22 years (begins early production in 2010-2011). In 2013 Penasquito produced 6.216 million ounces for Silver Wheaton (down from 6.572m in 2012, 5.284m in 2011) at a cost of $4.02 per ounce (up from $3.99, $3.93). Like over half of the world's silver producing mines, the Penasquito mine also produces lead, copper and zinc. In 2013 company production totaled 35.823 million ounces (26.754 million of that pure silver +0%, the rest being gold) 22.0% higher than 2012, 41.2% more than 2011, +110% vs 2009. In 2013 it sold 29.963 million ounces of silver equivalent (+9.6%) at an average price per ounce of $23.58 ($31.09 in 2012, $34.65 in 2011). In 2013 the unit price paid for pure silver was up six cents to $4.12 (incl gold $4.65) while the realized price was down 717 cents to $23.86 (incl gold $23.58). In 2011 though the unit price paid per silver equivalent ounce was only five cents higher at $4.09 it sold each ounce for 67.6% more, in 2010 it was 36.6% more. Total revenue was down 17% in 2013, up 16% in 2012, up 72% in 2011. Mines The silver it has agreed to purchase is in Mexico (40%), Portugal (20%), USA (10%), Chile (9%), Peru (9%), Argentina (7%), Sweden (4%), Greece and Canada (about 1%). Silver Wheaton doesn't own or operate the mines but the contracts it has with their owners gives it full access to any silver (gold at the Minto Mine) mined there. The six mines from which the company gets most of its silver are : San Dimas, Penasquito, Barrick (made up of five parts), Yauliyacu, Zinkgruvan, Cozamin and Minto. In addition there are six other smaller mines that contribute about 22% of the total. The San Dimas mine was sold by Goldcorp in the summer of 2010 to Mala Noche Resources Corp. (later renamed Primero Mining) for half a billion dollars complicating things for Silver Wheaton which had already made an agreement with Goldcorp for the silver. In response Silver Wheaton agreed to a new contract agreement. The Penasquito mine which began producing in September 2010 (and has a mine life of 22 years) is Mexico's largest open pit mine. \\\\- The agreement it has with Barrick Gold involves the silver produced at 4 mines; Pascua Lama, Lagunas Norte (Peru), Pierina (Peru) and Veladero (Argentina). The deal involving the Lagunas Norte, Pierina and Veladero mines was made in September 2009, required an initial deposit of $212.2 million, gives Silver Wheaton 100% of the silver produced and ends at the conclusion of 2013. The Pascua-Lama mine (at the border of Chile and Argentina) contract gives Silver Wheaton access to a quarter of the silver produced there from 2013 to 2017 and could raise silver sales by 30%. \\\\- Subsidiary Silverstone Resources Corp. owns 100% of the life of mine silver produced at mines in Neves-Corvo and Aljustrel, Portugal. The Lundin Mining owned Neves-Corvo mine located near the Iberian Pyrite Belt is primarily a copper and zinc producer. \\\\- Mine 777 in Manitoba belongs to HudBay Minerals. The mine was the source of 62.8% of Silver Wheaton's gold produced in 2012. In the last quarter alone it accounted for 19,615 ounces of gold, more than Silver Wheaton's other gold mine produced over the entire year (18,600 oz). When converted to silver equivalent using the gold to silver ratio, gold from 777 accounted for 40.5% of the increase in total production in 2012.

Gibfield, Howe Bridge and Chanters collieries exploited the coal mines (seams) of the middle coal measures in the Manchester Coalfield. The Fletchers built company housing at Hindsford and a model village at Howe Bridge which included pithead baths and a social club for its workers. The company became part of Manchester Collieries in 1929. The collieries were nationalised in 1947 becoming part of the National Coal Board. History =Fletcher Burrows= In 1776 Robert Vernon Atherton of Atherton Hall leased the Atherton coal rights to Thomas Guest from Bedford and John Fletcher of Tonge with Haulgh, Bolton forbidding them to mine under the hall. The Fletchers had mining interests in Bolton and Clifton in the Irwell Valley from Elizabethan times. Matthew Fletcher's family owned most of Clifton in 1750 including the Ladyshore and Wet Earth collieries. During the early 19th century the Fletchers worked several pits around Howe Bridge. In 1832 John Fletcher's son Ralph, who lived at the Haulgh in Bolton, died leaving his pits at Great Lever to his son, John who had built up the Lovers' Lane pit, and divided the business in Atherton into shares for his sons, John, Ralph, James and his nephew John Langshaw. The company was then known as \\"John Fletcher and Others\\". The company developed the Howe Bridge Collieries and sank three shafts in the 1840s when James Fletcher was the manager. The family acquired land and property in Atherton and between 1867 and 1878 Ralph Fletcher controlled the business. Abraham Burrows became a partner in 1872 and the company became Fletcher Burrows and Company. John Burrows was the company's agent from 1878 to 1900 when Leonard Fletcher took over. In 1916 Clement Fletcher took over and remained with the company for 45 years. The Fletcher Burrows Company was considered to be a good employer as well as having a reputation for good management, in the 1870s it built homes at Hindsford and the model village at Howe Bridge for its workers. The houses were designed by a Dutch architect. and some properties at Howe Bridge are now part of a conservation area. A public bathhouse, shops and a social club were part of the village. The workers, some of them pit brow women who worked on the pit brow screens sorting coal, were provided with hampers or turkeys at Christmas by the company. The Fletchers also contributed to the cost of St Michael and all Angels Church at Howe Bridge in 1877. In 1867 company employee Edward Ormerod developed and patented the \\"Ormerod\\" safety link or detaching hook, a device that has saved thousands of lives in mines. The company was a supporter in setting up the first Mines Rescue Station in Lancashire at Howe Bridge in 1908. In 1921 Heath Robinson visited the company's pits and was commissioned to produce its 1922 calendar. =The collieries= Among the old small pits working around Howe Bridge in the early 19th century were the, Old Endless Chain pit at Lovers Lane, the Old Engine Pit, the New Engine Pit (a gin pit), Marsh Pit, Little Pit, Sough Pit and Crabtree Pit. Colliers who worked for the Fletchers were entitled to free ale at the end of their shifts at the Wheatsheaf. In 1774 coal was sold for 2d. a basket but the price had risen to 5d. by 1805. The largest of the early pits owned by the Fletchers which eventually became the Howe Bridge Collieries were Lovers' Lane Colliery which lasted until 1898 and the Eckersley Fold pits. The Crombouke Day-Eye, a drift mine or adit dates from the 1840s when a drift was driven into the Crombouke and the Brassey mines at a gradient of 1 in 5. The Crombouke and Eckersley Fold pits closed in 1907. The company sank the deep mines of Howe Bridge Colliery in 1845. Three shafts were sunk to the Seven Feet mine, the Victoria pit where coal was wound at 447 feet, the Puffer for pumping water at 435 feet and the Volunteer, the upcast ventilation shaft. Howe Bridge Colliery was taken over by Manchester Collieries and closed in 1959. Gibfield Colliery's origins are in a shaft sunk to the Trencherbone mine in 1829 next to the Bolton and Leigh Railway line which opened in 1830. The colliery was served by sidings near Bag Lane Station. In 1872 the colliery was expanded when a new shaft was sunk to access the Arley mine at 1233 feet. A third shaft was sunk after 1904 accessing nine workable coal seams between the Arley Mine and the Victoria or Hell Hole mine while the original Gibfield shaft was used for ventilation. The first pit-head baths in the country were built at Gibfield in 1913. Gibfield closed in 1963 and the site was cleared. Chanters Colliery in Hindsford was sunk in 1854 in an area where coal had been mined for centuries from small pits. One of these pits, the Gold Pit which closed before 1800 was reputed to have had an engine. The colliery was modernised and developed in 1891 when two shafts were sunk first to the Trencherbone Mine at 1121 feet and deepened to the Arley Mine at 1832 feet in 1896. These shafts accessed 12 coal seams. Coal screens and a washery were built, and steel headgear and a new winding engine installed by 1904. The colliery was continually developed and modernised and lasted until 1966. =Merger= In 1927 Robert Burrows proposed a merger of several local colliery companies including the Atherton Collieries operating west of Manchester. As a result Manchester Collieries was formed in 1929. In turn when the coal industry was nationalised in 1947 Manchester Collieries became part of the National Coal Board's Western Division, No1 (Manchester) Area. A reorganisation in 1952 moved the Atherton Collieries into No2 (Wigan) Area. Colliery railways and locomotives Ellesmere in preservation After 1830 Lovers Lane colliery was connected to the Bolton and Leigh Railway at Fletchers sidings north of Atherleigh. The Fletchers built a tramroad to a landsale yard at Stock Platt Bridge in Leigh where their coal was sold. This tramroad constructed to standard gauge was converted to narrow gauge hauled by horses before 1850. The Fletchers decided to extend this short branch to the Bridgewater Canal in 1857. A basin at Bedford was built and the railway constructed from Stock Platt through Bedford via a tunnel, 889 feet long, built by the cut-and-cover method. A new line from Howe Bridge to the east of the turnpike was built to the tunnel by May 1861 and the old tramway was removed. The Fletchers bought two locomotives for use on this line, Lilford and Ellesmere, from Hawthorn's in Leith. They had reduced chimneys as the tunnel height was restricted. The tunnel operated for 70 years although in the later years its use declined and the track was lifted in 1952. The workshops at Gibfield Colliery built a 0-4-0 saddle tank in either 1888 or 1893 which probably worked to Bedford basin. It had no cab and a reduced chimney and was named Electric. Chanters was connected to the Manchester and Wigan Railway line built by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), in 1864 between Tyldesley and Howe Bridge Station by a short branch provided by the LNWR. Fletcher Burrows bought another Hawthorn's locomotive Atherton and in 1878, a six coupled saddle tank locomotive, Collier, from Manning Wardle in Leeds. Vulcan, a 0-6-0 saddle tank, was bought from the Vulcan Foundry in 1892 A replacement for Lilford with the same name was bought from the Hunslet Engine Company in 1897 and in 1909 the company bought its largest locomotive, another 0-6-0 saddle tank, Atlas from Pecketts in Bristol. Two saddle tank locomotives, Carbon a 0-4-0 in 1920, and in 1923 Chowbent a 0-6-0 were bought from Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. in Kilmarnock. In 1927 0-6-0 saddle tank Colonel was bought from Hunslets.

Biography Born in the spring of 2008, Snip Nua was a racing greyhound who became famous because she featured in the BBC television show Three Men go to Ireland, which was broadcast over the Christmas holidays in December 2009. The show was eagerly anticipated in Ireland as it promised to provide good publicity for both Greyhound racing and Irish tourism, and was even referenced on the Irish tourist board website. Due to its inclusion in the television programme, Snip Nua's performance at Mullingar Greyhound stadium in the Three Men Go to Ireland race was watched by an estimated 5-7 million people in the UK alone. Fior Gael syndicate Snip Nua was owned by a 16-member syndicate, Fior Gael. In Ireland, syndication is a popular way of spreading the cost and responsibility of greyhound ownership. The Fior Gael syndicate was made up of a group of professionals and business people, among them barristers, lawyers, and journalists. Notable members of the syndicate included Frank McNally, business editor of The Irish Times, and comedian Dara Ó Briain. Ó Briain once described his membership of the syndicate as his worst financial investment. He claimed that despite owning six dogs in seven years the syndicate had only had one win. At the time of the Three Men show, Snip Nua was the syndicate's latest dog. She appeared to be a promising racer who might break the syndicate's poor run of success, and in her first races, the young dog indeed put in some strong performances Death and legacy Snip Nua's career as a professional racer was short; on 14 December 2009 she was euthanized after sustaining a hock injury at Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium.

He advises the Trades Union Congress on economics and taxation, and is a long- standing member of the Tax Justice Network. He is a Professor of Practice in International Political Economy at City University London. Early life Richard Murphy was born in 1958 and brought up in Ipswich. His undergraduate degree was in Economics and Accountancy at the University of Southampton, and further trained at KPMG becoming a Chartered Accountant. Career For much of his early career he was an accountant in Downham Market, Norfolk. In 1985 he co-founded an accountancy firm which became Murphy Deeks Nolan. The company was sold in 2000. Murphy was also the founder of a company that became the European distributor for the game Trivial Pursuit. Murphy has since admitted that the manufacturing operation he set up in Ireland to manufacture Trivial Pursuit was there to avoid UK taxation, something of which he is now ashamed and was a turning point in his career towards anti-tax avoidance campaigning. Since 2003 Murphy has become more involved in economic and taxation policy issues. He was a co-founder of the Tax Justice Network. He is the director of Tax Research LLP. However, because Tax Research LLP is a Limited Liability Partnership he is technically the designated member rather than a director. The only other member of Tax Research LLP is Mrs Jacqueline Murphy. Murphy was named by International Tax Review as the seventh most significant person having influence on tax policy, practice and administration in 2013. In 2009, Murphy lost a libel claim by Lord Ashcroft and associated businesses where he misunderstood an article posted on an unrelated website and published a blog post claiming that Lord Ashcroft's Belize bank provided \\"tax evasion services\\". In September 2015, Murphy was appointed Professor of Practice in International Political Economy in the Department of International Politics at City University London, as a part-time appointment involving research and teaching. Previously he had been a visiting fellow at University of Portsmouth Business School, the Centre for Global Political Economy at the University of Sussex, and at the Tax Research Institute at the University of Nottingham. He was the founder of, and remains on the Board of Directors of, the Fair Tax Mark. Public policy He is an advocate of Modern Monetary Theory. He thinks it could be applied to, though not essential for, a Green New Deal. =Tax= Murphy is a promoter of financial reform, with specific emphasis given to tax avoidance/evasion. He estimates that \\"£25 billion is lost annually from tax avoidance\\". This is substantially larger than HM Revenue and Customs' estimate of £2.7 billion, and his estimate has been dismissed by HMRC. Murphy claims that HMRC insiders have suggested to him that £300 million additional investment in the department could recoup £8 billion in unpaid tax. His methodology has been criticised by other groups, including the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation in their December 2012 publication The Tax Gap for Corporation Tax, and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which cited his estimate of the corporate tax gap for the TUC as one which was \\"likely overstated (possibly by a wide margin)\\". Murphy advocates \\"country by country reporting\\", as a means to increase financial transparency to reduce tax avoidance and evasion. In 2013, the OECD and G8 endorsed a form of country-by- country reporting. Murphy is in favour of a land value tax, which would tax land based only on its value, and not on the buildings on it, in order to discourage land hoarding and promote building in areas in need of more housing. It is also very difficult to evade. He has written in favour of removing high-denomination notes such as the £50 note as they are used widely for tax evasion, saying \\"there is not a shadow of a doubt that vast amounts of cash\\" are used for illegal purposes. =Involvement in \\"Corbynomics\\"= In August 2015, many of Murphy's ideas were taken up as proposed policies by Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour Party leadership election. Corbyn was elected and became Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition, his economics policies were dubbed \\"Corbynomics\\". This included a policy called People's Quantitative Easing. \\\\- a broader development of a policy Murphy launched in 2010, called Green Quantitative Easing. Corbyn also cited Murphy's estimate of there being £120 billion of missing tax revenue as part of the economic plan issued during his election campaign stating that this was enough to \\"double the NHS budget\\". In addition, Corbyn adopted several of the remedies that Murphy has advocated (including country-by-country reporting) to address this revenue gap. Murphy later clarified that in his view not all of the missing revenue was \\"recoverable\\", and that \\"at best\\" £20 billion of it could be collected. Murphy was notably not part of Labour's Economic Advisory Committee, which was set up after the leadership election in September 2015. Murphy was an informal adviser to Corbyn, though it is reported that he had hoped to have a position on the Labour Party Treasury Team. Murphy said in June 2016 that those demanding a change in the Labour leadership were correct, \\"even if I will not agree with much of their reasoning\\". Corbyn had \\"not provided a vision of what his leadership will deliver\\", and concerning Labour's economic policies: \\"we have so far heard almost nothing that really progresses the ideas outlined last summer\\". A few weeks later, Murphy criticised Corbyn's track record further writing \\"there was no policy direction, no messaging, no direction, no co-ordination, no nothing\\". In a response to a question raised in the House of Commons, Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell stated with regard to Murphy \\"He is not the economic adviser and never has been, because we doubted his judgment, unfortunately. He is a tax accountant, not an adviser. He is actually excellent on tax evasion and tax avoidance, but he leaves a lot to be desired on macroeconomic policy\\". =Scotland= Murphy is a vocal critic of Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland as a report on the state of the Scottish economy. Murphy stated, \\"Revenue Scotland is still struggling to work out which people are tax resident in Scotland and it has no clue at all on what corporation tax, VAT or other taxes are due, precisely because no-one has to declare those taxes separately for Scotland. It’s the same with imports and exports: no-one knows what these are because there are no border posts at Carlisle, Berwick-on-Tweed or Stranraer. On investment and savings, we’re equally clueless.\\" He added, \\"25 of the 26 income figures in a set of accounts are estimates extrapolated from data for the UK as a whole and some consumer surveys.\\" At a subsequent appearance before the Holyrood, Finance and Constitution Committee, Murphy was however criticised for being unable to justify some of these claims. Media commentary Murphy writes for The Guardian. In 2001 Murphy wrote an article in The Observer recommending that parents set up a personal service company for their nanny, as an alternative to illegal cash-in-hand payments, to avoid income tax and national-insurance contributions. Murphy has been described by the Daily Mirror journalist Kevin Maguire as an \\"heroic figure\\" and the Guardian journalist Polly Toynbee has called him a \\"tireless campaigner\\".

He was also considered a wit. His comic and satirical verses, written in correspondence with James Smith, were published in 1656. He figures prominently in the Diary of Samuel Pepys; Pepys, who reported directly to Mennes at the Navy Office, thought him an incompetent civil servant but a delightful social companion. Career He was the third son of Andrew Mennes of Sandwich, Kent, and Jane Blechnden. Educated at his local grammar school in Sandwich, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, Mennes went to sea and in 1620 saw action off Dominica fighting Spanish warships.John Mennes at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. In 1628 he was given command of and later he commanded , HMS Red Lion, , , and . In August 1641 he took Queen Henrietta Maria to safety in Hellevoetsluis in the Netherlands and was knighted by King Charles I for doing so and in July 1642 he refused to accept the parliamentary takeover of the fleet. In 1643, once the King had lost the Navy, he transferred to the Army and became a general of artillery and in 1644 he became Governor of North Wales. In 1645 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief at the Downs until 1649. In 1650 he left England to join the exiled Court abroad. =Mennes and Samuel Pepys= In November 1661, following the Restoration of the monarchy, he was commissioned Vice Admiral and Commander in Chief in the Narrow Seas, and Captain of and commander of the Fleet taking the Earl of Peterborough to occupy English Tangier. This appears to have been his last active Commission. Before the voyage, he had been appointed Comptroller of the Navy. Samuel Pepys, who as Clerk of the Acts reported directly to Mennes, described him as \\"ill at ease\\" in this role (which in fairness to Mennes has been described as \\"impossibly burdensome\\") and when exasperated by Mennes' incompetence, as he all too frequently was, would refer to him in his Diary as a \\"coxcomb\\", \\"dolt\\", \\"dotard\\" and \\"old fool\\". Outside office hours, however, Pepys admitted that Mennes, with his skills as a poet and mimic, was the best of company. Pepys describes a memorable evening when Mennes and John Evelyn engaged in a mimicry contest; Mennes with great generosity admitted that Evelyn was the winner. Pepys's kindest judgment on him (when he was wrongly thought to be dying in 1666) was that he was a \\"good, honest, harmless gentleman, but not fit for office\\". Dissatisfaction with Mennes became general, and sporadic efforts were made by his colleagues to have him removed, without success. It is generally thought that he owed his survival to the increasingly bitter attacks on the Navy Board in the House of Commons: the King was reluctant to sacrifice Mennes, as this might have led to an all out attack on the administration of one of the most important Departments of State. Even Pepys was prepared in 1670 to defend Mennes in public before the House of Commons as a man of great integrity who had worn out his health in the service of the Crown.The Diary of Samuel Pepys He died in London in 1671, aged 71, while still in the post of Controller. The bulk of his estate passed to his nephew Francis Hammond. Poetry A 1683 edition of poems by Mennes His poetry was published in a collection entitled Musarum Deliciæ or the Muses's Recreation, in 1656. Mennes's verses appear to have been written for amusement in correspondence with Dr. James Smith, whose replies were also included. Both were light and satirical in tone. The publisher, Henry Herringman, stated that the poems had been collected by him from \\"Sir John Mennis and Dr. Smith's drolish intercourses.\\" Another anthology called Wit Restored was published in 1658. This contains verse letters from Smith to Mennes, \\"then commanding a troop of horse against the Scots.\\" Another piece was written to Mennes \\"on the Surrender of Conway Castle.\\" A satirical poem on John Suckling's feeble military efforts at the Battle of Newburn is attributed to Mennes. Mennes was himself satirised by John Denham, whose poem about Mennes going from Calais to Boulogne to \\"eat a pig\\" is mentioned by Samuel Pepys in his diary.Robert Bell, Lives of the most eminent literary scientific men of Great Britain, Longmans, 1839, p.56. Shakespeare anecdote According to Thomas Plume Mennes told him that he had once met William Shakespeare's father John Shakespeare, describing him as a \\"merry cheeked old man\\" who said of his son that \\"Will was a good honest fellow, but he durst have cracked a jest with him at any time.\\"Kate Pogue, Shakespeare's Family, Greenwood, 2008, p. 24. As Katherine Duncan-Jones points out, this is impossible, since Mennes was two years old when John Shakespeare died. She thinks Plume may have been recording an anecdote related by Mennis taken from his father.Katherine Duncan-Jones, Ungentle Shakespeare: Scenes from His Life, Cengage Learning EMEA, 2001, p.8 Family In 1641 he married Jane Liddel (died 1662); she may have been his second wife. They had no children. In his later years, according to Pepys, his widowed sister Mary Hammon or Hammond (died 1668), mother of Francis Hammond, kept house for him. In addition to his nephew Francis he had at least two nieces to whom he left legacies; his niece Elizabeth Hammond was his executrix.

History  Saint Benedict Center began in 1941 as a student center in an old furniture store in Harvard Square on the corner of Bow and Arrow Streets, just a half a block from the Harvard Yard. It was directly across the street from the Romanesque front porch of St. Paul Church, Cambridge's renowned \\"university church\\". The three original founders were Catherine Goddard Clarke, Avery Dulles (then a Harvard Law student), and Christopher Huntington, a Harvard dean. Catherine Clarke went on to help found the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Avery Dulles entered the Jesuit Order and later became a Cardinal, and Christopher Huntington became a priest on Long Island, New York. Fr. Leonard Feeney later became the head of the Saint Benedict Center. The center was engaged in controversy with the Church over his interpretation of extra ecclesiam nulla salus (referred to as Feeneyism, meaning \\"outside the Church there is no salvation\\") which led to a lack of clarity regarding the center's status in the Catholic Church. Under the direction of Feeney, Clarke and others organized into a religious community called the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In January of 1958, the group moved from Cambridge to the town of Harvard. Differences in governance ultimately led to most of the Brothers becoming Benedictines and most of the Sisters reorganizing as the Sisters of Saint Benedict Center, Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. =Canonical recognition= The brothers' community gained canonical recognition as a Pious Union in 1975 and a Benedictine Priory dependent on the Swiss-American Congregation in 1980. The Priory became independent in 1990. In 1993, the Priory became a full-fledged abbey and the monks elected Right Reverend Gabriel Gibbs, OSB, as first abbot. The Saint Benedict Abbey follows the Benedictine Rule and is governed by the Benedictine Confederation.

Together with his long-time business partner Allan Johnston, he formed the Australian advertising agency Mojo which enjoyed much local and some international success in the 1980s and whose name survived till 2016 as Publicis Mojo, the Australian subsidiary of the French multinational advertising and communications company holding Publicis Groupe.Mojo Brand disappears Advertising pedigree Morris' father Carl Morris was one of the Australian servicemen who upon return from World War II formed the Melbourne ad agency United Service Publicity - he was the agency's Production Manager. The US agency group Needham Harper Steers entered the Australian market in 1967 by taking a stake in United Service Publicity and changed its name in 1972 to USP Needham, whose lineage can be directly traced to today's Melbourne office of DDB Worldwide. Alan Morris' brother Don Morris AO is also an advertising executive and the two worked together at a number of points in their careers with Don being significantly involved in the life of the Mojo agency. Career Morris' first job was as a copywriter in Canada while travelling. On his return to Australia he joined Rogers Holland and Everingham and then Mullins Clarke and Ralph, where he was creative director and had a shareholding. In the mid-1970s he took to freelancing and at one point was teamed with writer Allan Johnston at Hertz Walpole in Sydney.

The Mojo approach to TV advertisements used a colloquial and irreverent style, often with a catchy jingle to simple accompaniment. Contrasting against the clipped and British-imitating style of voice presenters on Australian TV up till that point, Mojo ads highlighted Australian idiom and its laconic accent. Ads such as \\"I’m as Australian as Ampol”, \\"Hit 'em with the Old Pea Beau\\" (insectide), \\"Everybody loves Speedo”, \\"I Can Feel a Fourex Coming on\\", \\"Every Amco tells a Story\\" (for Amco jeans) all came out of the Mojo agency in the 1980s. The use of Peter Allen's I Still Call Australia Home to promote Qantas was developed at Mojo in the late 1980s and until 2011 this campaign concept was still used by Qantas and its ad agencies.

The style was popular between late 1950s and early 1960s.Armando Siahaan, Jengki Homes for a Free Indonesia , The Jakarta Globe, October 26, 2009 Jengki style reflected the new influence of the United States on Indonesian architecture after hundreds years of the Dutch colonial rule. It can be interpreted as a tropical interpretation of American post-war modernist suburb houses. Johan Silas, a native architect, speculates that this distinctive architecture is an expression of the political spirit of freedom among the Indonesians, which translated into an architecture that differs from what the Dutch had done. History =Early form= Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij staff's housing in Kebayoran Baru. Jengki style first appeared with the development of new satellite town Kebayoran Baru. Construction of the area was finished in 1955.Kebayoran Baru, Riwayatmu Dulu , Kompas 29 Juli 2006. These houses, which were made for the staffs of BPM oil company, were known for its bold character and playful angles. For example, middle class houses in Kebayoran were designed with square or rectangular layout, but the first floor is tilted forward to protect the facade of the lower level from the sun. Lower-level official houses in Kebayoran make use of front patio. Similar houses were built in other cities where the BPM operates, e.g. Balikpapan. =Development of a new style= The style was further developed in the 1950s. Bold use of color is introduced, while playful angles and steep unusual roofs characterized houses of this period. It is also becoming more and more influenced with the American mid- century modern style. At this period, the particular style was known in Indonesia as Yankee-type or Jengki style due to its heavy American influence. It can be interpreted as a tropical interpretation of American mid-century Googie style. Buildings in Jengki style were mostly designed by construction companies or architecture students of Bandung Institute of Technology, where the first Department of Architecture in Indonesia was established in 1951. Initially established under Dutch professors, they had to leave in the mid 1950s during the second wave of repatriation due to political turmoil in newly independent Indonesia. For a short period some German professors managed the department, but by the end of the 1950s it was taken over by Americans and Indonesian graduates from American universities. Consequently, the architecture graduates of ITB are most influenced by American architecture. Among those graduates are Djelantik, Harjono Sigit, Johan Silas and Harry Winarno Kwari. This influence was possibly brought through American teachers working at the Department of Architecture at Bandung Institute of Technology in the mid-1950s. Characteristic Essentially, Jengki style rejected the strict cubic geometric forms that the Dutch had used before World War II. Jengki style made use of unusual shapes, such as pentagons, and sharp bold angles. Asymmetrical roofs and facades, playful cut-out doors and windows, and oddly tilted roofs and eaves were imbued with a spirit of cheerfulness and freedom. They were associated with an expression of the political spirit of freedom among the Indonesians. Frances Affandi, the executive director of the Bandung Heritage Society, says that the structures are \\"... charming and noteworthy, but underresearched, underdocumented and underappreciated.” Examples Many Jengki style buildings have been demolished but examples remain across Indonesia, particularly in the capital Jakarta, and in the Javan cities of Bandung, Yogyakarta, Solo and Semarang, as well as outside Java – in Medan, Biak, Makassar and Balikpapan.

Rumoh Aceh (Acehnese: \\"Aceh house\\") is a type of traditional vernacular house found in the Aceh Province in Indonesia. It is basically a wooden pile dwelling. Rumoh Aceh is also known as krong bade, which may actually refer to the rice granary (krōng, \\"storage\\" + padé, \\"rice\\") and not the house. Rumoh Aceh is the largest and tallest of all vernacular house type found in the Aceh Province, the others are the Rumoh Santeut and the Rangkang. The Rumoh Aceh reflects the culture of the Acehnese people. These houses can still be found in the periphery of Banda Aceh, although they are on the verge of extinction. The house and its perimeter The frontal side of a Rumoh Aceh, the main entrance stairways is visible, leading to a roofed front terrace. Rumoh Aceh is a pile dwelling erected over posts which rest on flat stones or concrete plinth. It is constructed of timbers, topped with a wooden gabled roof which is covered with either thatched palm leaves or corrugated metal. Rumoh Aceh are found scattered in a traditional kampung (Acehnese: gampong) with no specific pattern; however, they are always aligned with their gables positioned toward the east and west. The exterior can be ornamented with woodcarvings of floral or geometric patterns, usually found in the triangular gables, around the windows and on the boards. The triangular gable decoration consists of an ornamented triangular wooden screen which slant outwards and is perforated to allow cross ventilation. The houses' entrances are located on the non-gabled (north or south) sides. This entrance is a steep staircases leading to a roofed front terrace (Acehnese: seulasa, \\"veranda\\"). The space below the house is used for storing goods such as timber for construction, firewood, crops, or bicycles; or for a resting area, with benches. The house area is marked by perimeter hedges or fences. Occasional trees provide shade into the house's courtyard. The rice granary (Acehnese: krōng padé, \\"rice storage\\") is a small rice granary located under or beside the house. Unlike rice granaries in Java, which hold sheaves of rice, rice granaries in Aceh hold unhusked rice. Wealthier Acehnese may build a wooden gateway entrance (Acehnese: keupaleh) at the entrance of the house area. Interior layout Rumoh Aceh are always oriented with their gables facing east and west. The east-west direction may originally have been connected with life-death - this sacred-profane symbolism is commonly found in Indonesia. After the Islamization of Aceh, the west direction is sometimes associated with the direction of Mecca. The interior of a Rumoh Aceh is divided into three sections: the front (the northern or southern breadth of the house, where the entrance stairs are located), the middle (the central breadth of the house), and the rear (similar to the front, but on the opposite side). These separate areas are divided by wooden partitions; a corridor connected the front section with the back section through the middle section. The front section (Acehnese: seuramou keu, \\"front terrace\\") is basically a long spacious gallery. Steep entrance stairs connect the front section of the house with the outdoors. The Acehnese name of this section, the \\"front terrace\\" or \\"front veranda\\", refers to former times when this section used to be completely open. Nowadays, the section is completely enclosed, though it may have some windows. The front section is identified with the \\"male\\" realm of the house; similar symbolism is found throughout the Indonesian archipelago to refer to the section of a house where public-related activities, such as receiving guests and reading the Qur'an, are held. The section is also the area where young men sleep. The rear section (Acehnese: seuramoe likoot, \\"back terrace\\") is similar to the front section, in that it is a spacious long gallery, but lacks a main entrance. It is the most private part of the house, where women of the house do their cooking activities. The rear section is identified with the \\"female\\" realm, associated with family matters. The rear section may be expanded to add more space for cooking (Acehnese: rumoh dapu, \\"kitchen house\\"). The middle section (Acehnese: rumah inong, \\"parental house\\") consists of a corridor (Acehnese: rambat) connecting the front section and the rear section through the center of the house, and bedrooms. Bedrooms are located on both side of this corridor, to the east and west, toward the gables. The east-side bedroom, used for the daughter, is known as anjong. The west-side bedroom, the main bedroom of the household, is known as jurei. The bedrooms can be accessed from the back section via doorways. The entire middle section is built about half a meter higher than the front section and back section, the difference in elevation is clearly visible from the outside of the house. One of the bedrooms functions as a ceremonial nuptial chamber, where daughters and their husbands will reside during the first years of their marriage. One can see the middle section as the most important part of the house, in relation to the lower sections of the male front section and the female rear section, a place for a bedroom where procreation may takes place. Construction Acehnese traditional house in Piyeung Datu village, Montasik district, Aceh Besar regency Rumoh Aceh are made entirely of wood, without nails. Traditionally, the floors are made of feather palm planks, the walls of thin woven bamboo, and the roof of thatched sago palm leaves. The entire construction is erected over pile construction which stands on stones. The ground under the house is compacted and made a bit higher than the area around the house, the soil is prevented from seeping away by edgings around this compacted soil. In the colonial era, the edgings were made of bottles planted into the ground bottom- up. When a daughter reached the age of seven, her father will start collecting building materials for the construction of the house where his daughter will live with her future husband. According to Acehnese custom, the girl has to live with her husband in the house of her mother until the first child is born. Afterwards she is allowed to move to her own house, within the compound of her mother. When her parents died, the daughter will acquire the rice fields and her parents' house. House construction begins with the erection of posts for the tallest middle section of the house, and then followed by the shorter posts for the front and rear section. Two of the house posts are named the \\"king post\\" (Acehnese: tameh raja) and \\"queen post\\" (Acehnese: tameh putrou) respectively. Both are located between the middle section and the front section, the \\"king post\\" on the right (north) side, the \\"queen post\\" on the left (south) side. A small piece of gold is inserted into the \\"queen post\\", either at its top or on one of the floor binders when mortised through the \\"queen post\\" and fixed by the wooden tenon. These posts are set as if they are still living trees, with the trunk base at the bottom and crown tip above. The last to be built are the roof plates. Ropes are used to fix the roof plates to the beams in such a way that the roof can be detached quickly in case of fire. Woodcarving decorations are not part of the construction phase, as such constructions are added much later. Determining the starting time of the construction is a crucial matter in the Acehnese culture. The house owner engages a traditional carpenter in the particular month thought to be the most auspicious to begin construction. Several rituals are carried out during the construction process: first when the posts and beams are erected, second when the main house building is constructed, and third after the construction is completed. The first ceremony is the sprinkling of raw materials such as uncooked rice and water at the site, completed with a small meal. The second ceremony is a ceremonial meal for the assistants of the carpenter, usually fifteen in number. The third and last ceremony is a big ceremonial feast served for as many people as the owner wants to invite. Acehnese people use traditional units for the house construction. The primary units are the jaroe (finger), paleut (width of the back of the hand), and hah (cubit). Secondary units are the jeungkai (distance between the spread-out thumb and middle finger), lhuek (length of the whole arm), and deupa (fathom). Decline Aceh Museum featuring the traditional Rumoh Aceh, in the background is a modern interpretation of the Cakra Donya roof. Unlike the traditional houses of the Balinese, the Rumoh Aceh is on the verge of extinction due to lack of the good timber required for their construction and their impracticality for modern lifestyle. The most reasonable reason is perhaps an interest in change: people living in traditional houses are associated with poverty, compared to the seemingly higher status of modern people living in modern houses. Several Acehnese architects have attempted to modernize the traditional architecture of Aceh. One attempt is to replicate the roof canopy of the Cakra Donya bell (an ancient relic in Aceh) into the auditorium of the State Museum of Aceh. This reinterpretation of the Cakra Donya roof was completed by Wim Sutrisno, a local architect. The Cakra Donya roof style has become popular in Aceh and can be found decorating the gates to hotels or bus shelter roofs. The gable roof has also been reinterpreted in many buildings, often with double gable screens, complete with a protruding wooden screen.

Background Matur was born to an Alevi Kurdish family on 14 September 1968 in the ancient Hittite city of Kahramanmaraş in Turkey's Mediterranean Region. Her first school education was in her village; later she attended the long-established Lycée in the region's most important cultural center Gaziantep. These years were spent living with her sisters far from their parents. She studied Law at Ankara University, but has never practiced. In her university years, she was published in several literary periodicals. Reviewers found her poetry \\"dark and mystic\\". The shamanist poetry with its pagan perceptions, belonging to the past rather than the present, of her birthplace and the nature and life of her village, attracted much attention. Books Her first book, Rüzgar Dolu Konaklar (Winds Howl Through the Mansions), published in 1996, unrelated to the contemporary mainstream of Turkish poets and poetry, won several literary prizes. Her second book, Tanrı Görmesin Harflerimi (God Must Not See The Letter of My Script) in 1999 was warmly greeted. Two further books, appeared at the same time in 2002, Ayın Büyüttüğü Oğullar (The Sons Reared by the Moon) and Onun Çölünde (In His Desert), have been continuing the distinctive language and world of imagery special to herself and her poetry. Her poem has been translated up to 17 languages. She has a translated book, which published by ARC in England, called in the Temple of a Patient God. Her translated book in German and French published in Luxembourg by PHİ Publishing House. Her last book, İbrahim’in Beni Terketmesi (Leaving of Abraham), published in March 2008, was considered by the critics to be her best book ever. In that book, her new way of imagery was considered as mystique. She created a personal ontology and a personal mythology inspired by the thousands year of Sufi Tradition. May 2009, she has published an album-book called Doğunun Kapısı: Diyarbakır (The Gate of East: Diyarbakir). The book is about the city called Diyarbakir, which is ancestral homeland of Kurdish and Armenian people. She has written a history of the city, which is nearly 3000 years old. Through her poetic text and the photos you can see the history of the city form ancient time to present. The book is considered by the critics, as one of the best book ever written about an Anatolian city. In 2010, she published Kader Denizi (Sea of Fate) with the photographs taken by Mehmet Günyeli after the exhibition of Sea of Fate in the prestigious galleries in Istanbul and Ankara. In 2010, she contributed to Son Defa with a monologue about love, played by Tiyatro Oyunevi and to Özgürlük (Freedom) with a poem called Dağ (Mountain), published with the cooperation of Amnesty International. In February 2011 she published her recent book called Dağın Ardına Bakmak (Looking Behind the Mountain) which is her first prose book. It is about the PKK Guerillas. For the book, she went to steep Kandil Mountain, where PKK is located and hided, for making interviews with the guerrillas, fight against the Turkish Army. The book is the first attempt to show off the personal stories and traumas of the guerillas behind the frontiers in the war. Journalism Since 2005, she writes regular articles for the Op-Ed of daily newspaper called Zaman as a columnist. She sometimes appeared in an English circulated newspaper Today's Zaman. Mainly, she writes about Kurdish politics, Armenian issue, daily politics, minority problems, prison literature, and women issues. She also runs of a cultural foundation called DKSV (Diyarbakır Cultural Art Foundation) which is located in Diyarbakır. She is conducting social projects with children, women and the younger population who were removed from their village. She is making a TV programme which called ATLAS is about culture, art and politics.

Club career =Valladolid= Born in Zamora, Castile and León, García was a Real Valladolid youth graduate. He made his senior debut with the reserves in the 2006–07 season, in Segunda División B. On 4 April 2010, García made his first-team – and La Liga – debut, coming on as a 34th-minute substitute for Marquitos in a 0–2 home loss to Villarreal CF. The campaign ended in relegation, and that would be his only competitive appearance with the main squad. =Salamanca= On 23 July 2010, García moved to Segunda División club UD Salamanca on a two-year deal. He made his official debut on 29 August, replacing Kike for the last minutes of a 1–1 home draw against Córdoba CF. García scored his first professional goal in his only start of the season, netting the first in a 2–2 home draw against CD Numancia on 4 June 2011. He totalled only 124 minutes of action, again experiencing relegation.

She held a chair in social psychology at the University of Münster (1980–1997) before taking up a chair in social psychology at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena in 1997.

Kessler (eds.), Intergroup Relations: The Role of Motivation and Emotion (pp. ix-xii) Hove: Psychology Press. Research Her research addressed the social psychology of social identity and relations between social groups, in particular she investigated determinants of negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors as well as determinants of tolerance, acceptance, and appreciation of outgroups. While employing both experimental and field research, Amélie Mummendey and colleagues investigated social psychological issues of high social relevance such as the “positive-negative-asymmetry” in social discrimination and strategies to cope with threatened or negative social identities.Mummendey, A., & Otten, S. (1998). Positive-negative asymmetry in social discrimination. European Review of Social Psychology, 9, 107-143.Mummendey, A., Kessler, T., Klink, A., & Mielke, R. (1999). Strategies to cope with negative social identity: Predictions by social identity theory and relative deprivation theory. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 7, 229-245. Amélie Mummendey was particularly interested in determinants of both discrimination and tolerance between social groups, conflict and cooperation, constructive versus destructive coping with social change, threats to social identities and limitations of tolerance and affiliation of outgroup members. Amélie Mummendey and colleagues empirical findings as well as a number of new theoretical models developed by them have been published in numerous books and prestigious journals. She died on 17 December 2018.FAZ.net: Professorin Dr. Amelie Dorothea Nummendey verstorben Ingroup Projection Model Together with Michael Wenzel, Amélie Mummendey developed the ingroup projection model (IPM).Mummendey, A., & Wenzel, M. (1999). Social discrimination and tolerance in intergroup relations: Reactions to intergroup difference. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, 158 -174. The IPM holds that members of one group always compare themselves to members of another group (e.g., Germans and Italians) by constantly using as a frame of reference a common superordinate group (e.g., Europeans). When a superordinate category is salient, subgroup members tend to project characteristics of their subgroup identity onto the prototype of the superordinate category. Therefore, members of one’s own subgroup appear to be good representatives – better members – of the superordinate category, while out-group members appear to be poorer representatives. Consequently, outgroup members are derogated and discriminated because they appear to deviate from the desired characteristics of the superordinate category. A number of empirical studies support the main claims of the model and recent developments of underlying motivational and cognitive processes contribute to a deeper understanding of ingroup projection.Wenzel, Mummendey, & Waldzus (2007). Superordinate identities and intergroup conflict: The ingroup projection model. European Review of Social Psychology, 18, 331-372. Current research investigates, among other things, new pathways for the reduction or avoidance of ingroup projection and therefore possibilities to foster intergroup tolerance.

In her last years, she broke completely with the theology of her teacher Rudolf Bultmann. Life Eta Linnemann studied Protestant theology in Marburg, Tübingen and Göttingen from October 1948 to July 1953. In August 1953 she presented at the Georg- August-Universität Göttingen for the First State Examination, and in August 1957, the Second State Examination. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover commissioned Linnemann to write interpretations of biblical texts for religious education. From this work arose her dissertation on the parables of Jesus - Gleichnisse Jesu, Einführung und Auslegung - with which she was promoted to a doctor of theology summa cum laude in July 1961 at the Church University Berlin-Zehlendorf. Between 1961 and 1966 she taught at the seminar for church service in Berlin-Zehlendorf, in 1967 she was appointed as Visiting Professor at Braunschweig University of Technology. In February 1970, Eta Linnemann worked in Marburg with Rudolf Bultmann and Ernst Fuchs on studies on the Passion story. On 10 August 1971, she was awarded an honorary professorship of New Testament at the Theological Faculty of the Philipps- University Marburg. The following year, the Braunschweig University of Technology appointed her to the chair of theology and methodology of religious education. Linnemann was a member of the international society Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas. Linnemann caused a stir in 1978 when, due to a conversion experience in November 1977 according to her own statement, she renounced the historical-critical method, and asked readers to destroy her previous publications.Eta Linnemann. Historical Criticism of the Bible: Methodology or Ideology? — Reflections of a Bultmannian turned Evangelical. Trans. Robert W. Yarbrough. Grand Rapids: Baker, 1990. 20pp. From 1983, at the age of 60, she departed Germany for Indonesia to train pastors at the Theological University of the Indonesian Mission community in Batu. In her book \\"What is credible - the Bible or the Bible criticism\\" Linnemann claimed in 2007, citing an unnamed ear witness, that Rudolf Bultmann on his death bed had recanted his critical views. A real proof of that assertion, however, so far (as of 2009) remains only an echo in Bultmann's research. Eta Linnemann lived her last years in the Loga district of Leer. Influence Linnemann rejected Markan priority and favored the Independence View of the synoptic gospels. One of Linnemann's views to find support among conservative English speaking scholarship, notably F. David Farnell, was her rejection of a Q (source) for the synoptic Gospels in favour of an explanation following the Jewish requirement of Deuteronomy 19:15 that \\"on the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed\\".Robert L. Thomas Three views on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels, 2002 p. 255, and p. 322 \\"Farnell 's third axiom notes, quoting Linnemann, that the reason for four independent Gospels stems from the legal principle of Deuteronomy 19:15b: \\"[O]n the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed.\\"\\" Selected publications * Bibel oder Bibelkritik?

He was born in Dublin and educated at Belvedere College and University College Dublin. He was called to the bar in 1926 and became a Senior Counsel in 1940. He served as Attorney General of Ireland from 1942 to 1946 when he was appointed a judge of the High Court where he served until his death in 1959. He was generally considered the best Irish Chancery judge of his time with a particular knowledge of trade union law and the law of charities. Despite the inevitably dry subject matter of many of his judgements, some of them display a considerable sense of humour.For example his view in Roundabout Ltd. v Beirne [1959]I.R.435 that the Courts do not object to legal subterfuges as long as they are successful. He was the High Court judge in the celebrated Constitutional test case O'Byrne v Minister for Finance[1959]I.R. 435 on the interpretation of the guarantee that a judge's salary shall not be reduced, a subject which remains controversial today. Dixon's ruling that notwithstanding the guarantee judges are liable to pay income tax was upheld by a majority of the Supreme Court.

At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Dibër. It is situated on the mountain Dešat, near the border with North Macedonia. History The village was first mentioned in 1467 in Ottoman records. In 1583, it was recorded as having 18 Christian and four Muslim residents. Of all of the local villages during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, while still under the Ottoman Empire, only Herebel and Kërçisht i Sipërm were populated by Bulgarian Exarchists, while the rest were populated by Muslims. Several members of the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps were born in Herebel.„Македоно-одринското опълчение 1912-1913 г. Личен състав“, Главно управление на архивите, 2006, стр. 251.

Linguists Klaus Steinke and Xhelal Ylli consider the overall census results to be accurate and reflective of much of the ethnic and religious demographics of the area during that time, \\"Bin Vergleich der beiden oben erwähnten Quellen mit der von den Österreichern während des ersten Weltkrieges durchgeführten Volkszählung, die zweifellos glaubwürdig ist, da sie sich auf eine direkte Befragung der Bevölkerung in den Jahren 1916-1918 stützt, zeigt Unstimmigkeiten.\\"; p.250. \\"Albaner A, Bulgaren B, Zigeuner Z, Sonstige S, Zigeuner Z, Musl.

Toward the end of the 1920s the Orthodox Slavic speaking population was located in only two villages of the Maqellarë area, Kërçisht i Epërm and Herebel while in the 1930s the population decline of Orthodox Slavophones continued. During the 2000s linguists Klaus Steinke and Xhelal Ylli seeking to corroborate villages cited in past literature as being Slavic speaking carried out fieldwork in villages of the area. The village of Herebel has only 6 Orthodox Slavic speaking families made up of 3 larger households of around 20 individuals each. \\"Seit Ende der 20er bis Anfang der 30er Jahre findet man nur noch Angaben für Gorno Krăčišta und Ărbele. Die demographische Entwicklung der 30er Jahre, nämlich der Rückgang des slavophonen Bevölkerungsanteils, der meist aus Orthodoxen bestand, hat sich fortgesetzt, wie die aktuell ermittelten Zahlen zeigen. In Herbel wohnen nur noch sechs orthodoxe Familien. Eigentlich sind es drei Großfamilien mit rund 20 Personan, die noch die südslavische Mundart sprechen.\\" Linguists Steinke and Ylli also noted that unlike the Gollobordë region, the villages of the Maqellarë administrative unit area do not have any Muslim Slavic speaking inhabitants. p. 252. \\"Anders als in den Dörfern Gollobordas sind in diesem Gebiet keine Spuren von slavophonen Muslimen zu finden.

The conflict started in the 1970s following tension between the native indigenous Assamese people and the Indian government over alleged neglect, domination, subjugation, political, social, cultural, economic exploitation and internal colonisation through its federal centre in Delhi. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of 12,000 United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) members and 18,000 others. Several organisations contribute to the insurgency including the ULFA, the Adivasi National Liberation Army, Karbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF) and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) with ULFA perhaps the largest of these groups, and one of the oldest, having been founded in 1979. The ULFA has attacked Hindi-speaking migrant workers and a movement exists favouring secession from the Republic of India. The alleged neglect and economic, social, cultural and political exploitation by the Indian state are the main reasons behind the growth of this secessionist movement. The ULFA seeks to establish a sovereign Assam via armed struggle. MULTA on the other hand seeks to establish an Islamic state in India via jihadist struggle of Muslims of both indigenous and migrant origin. The Government of India banned the organization in 1990 and classifies it as a terrorist group, while the US State Department lists it under \\"Other groups of concern\\". Founded at Rang Ghar, a historic structure dating to the Ahom kingdom on April7, 1979, the ULFA has been the subject of military operations by the Indian Army since 1990, which have continued into the present. In the past two decades some 30,000 people have died in the clash between the rebels and the government. Though separatist sentiment is considered strong, it is disputed if the secessionist movement continues to enjoy popular support. Conversely, assertions of Assamese nationalism are found in Assamese literature and culture. The neglect and exploitation by the Indian state are common refrains in the Assamese-language media with some reports casting the ULFA leaders as saviors. Internationally acclaimed Assamese novelist Indira Goswami has tried to broker peace for several years between the rebels and the government. In a recent development Hiren Gohain, a public intellectual, has stepped in to expedite the process. On 15 May 2019, Twelve people were injured after a grenade exploded in front of a shopping mall in Guwahati. Days later the United Liberation Front of Assam claimed responsibility for the attack, and the authorities arrested the main suspected of the attack.

Johnson (born April 10, 1958) is an American politician of the Democratic Party from Cleveland, Ohio. He is a member of Cleveland City Council representing Ward 10, and previously served as councilman for Ward 8 from 1984 to 1990 and later as a member of the Ohio Senate, from 1990 to 1998. Johnson was raised in the Collinwood neighborhood and graduated from Collinwood High School. He holds a bachelor's degree in communications from Kent State University and a J.D. degree and a master's degree in political science from Case Western Reserve University. He also attended John Carroll University and Cornell University. Johnson was seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party in the 1990s, and announced his candidacy in 1998 to replace retiring Representative Louis Stokes in the U.S. House of Representatives. A few weeks after his announcement, however, he was indicted on federal charges of extortion. FBI agents said between 1994 and 1996 Johnson accepted $17,000 in campaign contributions and personal loans in exchange for using his influence to land state licenses for grocers. He was convicted in November 1998 and began his sentence in 2000 after losing an appeal, serving 15 months in prison and a halfway house. On January 17, 2017, Johnson announced his candidacy for Mayor of Cleveland in the 2017 election. Career In 1984, Johnson was appointed as Councilman for Ward 8 as then-councilman Michael White was appointed to the Ohio State Senate. Johnson was then elected as the Ward 8 Councilman 90 days later and re-elected in 1985 and 1989.

He was recognized by community groups for his leadership. After Mayor Campbell's election loss in 2005, Johnson started his company, Prime Strategy Group, a political consultant firm. In 2008, after citing his successful post-conviction career, he received from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas an expungement that sealed his record. In 2008, the Ohio Supreme Court unanimously reinstated his law license. Johnson became a candidate for the Cleveland Ward 8 City Council position in 2009, and was elected in November of that year.

In response to increasing gun violence in Cleveland, Johnson remains a leader in the fight to reduce violent crime, and continues to call for a public/private partnership to respond to this city crisis. In 2016, Johnson supported raising the minimum wage in Cleveland to $15 per hour, believing that income inequality continues to be a major problem in Cleveland. As he has done in past elections, Johnson is an active supporter of national, state and local Democratic candidates for elected office. In 2016, he was the Ohio African American Vote Coordinator for the Presidential campaign of former Secretary of State, Hillary R. Clinton.

In the late 15th century he was the subordinate of Kemal Reis, the most important sea man of the Ottoman Empire during the reign of Beyazid II. He took service under Ottoman Empire as a captain. He then worked in Egypt under Mamluk rule and after the death of Kemal Reis in 1511, he sailed to Barbary coast (North West Africa) to attend the forces of Oruç Reis, an Ottoman privater who had established his own state. He took part in the conquest of Algiers in 1516. After the death of Oruç Reis in 1518, Oruç's brother Hayreddin Barbarossa voluntarily accepted the suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan Selim I . So Aydın Reis returned to Ottoman service.Biography portal Battle of Formentera One of the most important projects of the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century was evacuation and resettlement of some of the Muslims and Jews from the former Al Andalus lands after the defeat of the last Arab stronghold in Spain by Isabella I of Castile. Aydın Reis participated in this project and in 1529, in collaboration with Salih Reis, he began transferring Muslims from the port of Oliva, east Spain to Ottoman lands. But Spanish fleet chased them. So Aydın Reis landed the passagers in Balearic Islands and engaged with Spanish fleet near the isle Formentera in which the Spanish fleet was defeated and Rodrigo Portuondo, the commander died in the combat. History makes little mention the day when Aydin reis took on Spain's eight large war galleys with his much smaller fleet which by all the rules of war, should have gone the other way, and defeated them (Ernle Bradford, \\"The Sultans Admiral\\"). Later years  After the battle of Formentera, he was called to İstanbul to be rewarded by Suleyman I (so called the Magnificent). After Hayreddin Barbarossa was appointed as the admiral of the Ottoman navy, Aydın Reis was promoted to be the commander of the fleet in Algiers. He participated in the conquest Tunis in 1534 (to be lost to Spain the next year.) He died in Bone (modern Annaba, Algeria in 1535) from natural causes.

Family He was the eldest son of Sir Guylford Sligsby, Comptroller of the Navy (died 1631) and Margaret Water or Walter of York. His father was one of the many children of Sir Francis Slingsby and Mary Percy, sister of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland.Betham, William Baronetage of England London 1805 Vol. 5 p.26 He grew up at Bifrons in Canterbury, where his father, who came originally from Scriven in North Yorkshire, had purchased an estate.

Career Slingsby was elected Member of Parliament for Carysfort in the Irish House of Commons in 1634.Guildford Slingsby at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He later became lieutenant of the ordnance office and vice- admiral of Munster. =Secretary to Strafford= About the same time he entered Parliament, he entered the Lord Deputy's household as his personal secretary. It is possible that his cousin Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, who was then one of Strafford's closest friends, recommended him. He proved to be an excellent secretary and also became a close friend of Strafford.Wedgwood p.338 When Strafford was impeached, he asked Slingsby to join him in London, and throughout the trial which ended in Strafford's attainder and execution, Slingsby provided invaluable support, as well as giving evidence on his behalf. There were unconfirmed reports that Slingsby had attempted to arrange Strafford's escape from the Tower of London. It has been suggested that Slingsby may have been part author of the Brief and Perfect Relation of the Answers and Replies of Thomas Earl of Strafford to the Articles exhibited against him by the House of Commons, which was published in 1647. =Friendship with Strafford= Strafford's affection and regard for Slingsby are clear from his final letter to him:Wedgwood p.384 > Keep out of the way till I be forgotten and then your return may be with > safety...God direct and prosper you in all your ways; and remember there was > a person whom you were content to call master that did very much value and > esteem you and carried to his death a great stock of his affections for you.

It lies 2.3 miles (3.7 km) north- east from Lymington, its nearest town. The Groaning Tree of Baddesley In his Remarks on Forest Scenery, published in 1791, local author William Gilpin relates the history of \\"the groaning-tree of Badesly\\". He explains how around the year 1750 a local villager in South Baddesley frequently heard a sound like a \\"person in extreme agony\\" behind his house.William Gilpin, (1791), Remarks on forest scenery, and other woodland views (relative chiefly to picturesque beauty), illustrated by the scenes of New Forest in Hampshire, pages 162–164 He eventually discovered that the noise emanated from an elm tree. Within a few weeks the fame of the tree was such that people came from far and wide to listen to the tree, including Frederick, Prince of Wales and Princess Augusta. Many explanations were offered, both natural and supernatural for the phenomenon, but no adequate explanation could be found. The groaning continued, intermittently, for \\"eighteen or twenty months\\", until the owner decided to bore a hole in the trunk in an attempt to discover the cause. The tree never groaned again, and eventually the tree was deliberately uprooted, but nothing unusual was found.

They are used primarily in the United States, but are occasionally used in Canada and Mexico. They are an alternative to traffic cones which are smaller and easily hit by vehicles. Drums tend to command more respect from drivers than cones as they are larger, more visible, and give the appearance of being formidable obstacles. Construction barrels are typically bright orange and have four alternating white and orange reflective bands. However some regions, such as the province of Ontario, Canada, use black stripes instead of white. Most have a rubber base that prevents the barrel from tipping over during high winds. Construction barrels have a handle at the top so they can be easily picked up and carried. The handle also allows crews to install barricade lights to increase visibility. The product makes up a $90 million industry in the United States. Until the late 1980s, construction crews typically used 55-gallon steel drums to guide traffic through construction areas. They were painted orange and white and filled with sand or water to keep them in place. Because the drums were steel and weighed down with sand or water, extensive damage would occur to vehicles striking them. Plastic barrels that are commonly seen on American roadways today began emerging in the late 1970s and 1980s; steel 55-gallon drums were largely phased out by the 1990s and may no longer be used as traffic control devices in the US. By 1981, the drums were mainly a two-piece plastic design that included the top piece of the drum and a base that was filled with sandbags. The same year, an updated version of the invention was released by PSS; it included a flange to allow sandbag placement on the outside of the drum which made it easier to maneuver. In 1985, PSS released the modern-day version of the construction barrel, the LifeGard® drum. The LifeGard® utilized the sidewall of a recycled truck tire at its base to keep the drum securely in place on the roadway. This design is the most common one in use today.

The wilderness was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System when the United States Congress passed the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act in 2006 (Public Law 109-362). The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the agency in charge. The wilderness is broken into two sections. The Red Mountain unit is dominated by Red Mountain and the Cedar Creek (South Fork Eel River) drainage. Elevations range from at the southwest end along Cedar Creek to , less than three miles away at the top Red Mountain. Terrain is generally steep, consisting of rugged drainages dropping abruptly into Cedar Creek canyon. A small area of fairly gentle slopes is found near the summit. A zone of reddish soil occupies the central part of the area and contrasts sharply with the surrounding landscape. These unusual soils have resulted in a unique vegetation cover of several species of pine and cypress trees intermixed with a low brush understory. Rare and endangered plant species occupy the landscape covered by these ultrabasic soils. These rare plants have been isolated over space and time on serpentine rock near the summit of Red Mountain. This edaphic sky island holds the northern range extension of Sargent cypress (Cupressus sargentii). This is also the only location to find Red Mountain buckwheat (Eriogonum kelloggii) and Red Mountain stonecrop (Sedum eastwoodiae). Much of the area is designated and Research Natural Area (RNA) / Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). The red soil on Red Mountain is in the Littlered series. It is an Ultisol, a Haplohumult, with nearly 50% iron oxides. The main iron oxide is goethite (FeOOH), with enough hematite(Fe2O3)to make the soil red. The southern section called Cahto Peak unit consists of several Douglas fir forest watersheds, one of which is so pristine that it has been designated a Biosphere Reserve, a National Natural Landmark, and a Hydrologic Benchmark. Much of the area is designated a RNA / ACEC.

Constructed in 1860 on of land, the structure was inaugurated on 1 February 1897.  History  A firman issued by Nizam Sikandar Jah established the city of Secunderabad after his name in 1806. To honour the progress achieved by the British officers stationed at Secunderabad Cantonment in Hyderabad, the erstwhile British government established of land for this purpose in 1860. A 120-ft high clock tower was constructed in a park of in 1896. The tower was inaugurated by Resident Sir Trevor John Chichele Plowden on 1 February 1897. The clock on the tower was donated by Dewan Bahadur Seth Lachmi Narayan Ramgopal, a businessman. In 2003, the tower was placed on a demolition list drawn up by the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad to accommodate the increasing traffic. A senior official at this civic agency of the Government of Andhra Pradesh said that they were trying their best not to demolish this structure. In 2006, the park housing the tower was chosen for renovation by the same agency. Carried out at a cost of , the park's size was reduced to widen the roads. In addition, the tower was renovated, the park was landscaped with lawns and hedges, and a waterfall was installed. The renovation was completed in 2005, and the park was inaugurated by then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy in 2006. A martyr's memorial was also established inside the park in memory of the first police firing in 1969 during a separate Telangana agitation. Within a year after this, two of the tower's four clocks experienced technical problems and stopped working. The tower was declared a heritage structure in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad. It was as a result of the efforts put by the civic agency at sites like this tower that the proposal to seek UNESCO Heritage status for Hyderabad was revived. In 2006, the 200-year celebrations of the formation of Secunderabad were organised by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The clock tower was chosen as the subject of the logo, which was designed by a local firm. The outline of the Clock Tower was first conceived by the students of a city architectural college. A short cinema film of 9 minutes, 30 seconds by director Mani Shankar was released as a part of this celebration. The film, which relates the history of the city, features the clock tower in it. The park housing the tower also served as a venue for promoting various citizen-centric events such as a children's film festival, awareness programs among others.

His father was Prince Louis William Geldricus Ernest of Bentheim and Steinfurt; his mother was Juliane Wilhelmine of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg He studied in Marburg under Johann Stephan Pütter. In 1817, he succeeded his father as Prince of Bentheim and Steinfurt. In 1821, the Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda line of the family sued him, claiming to have better rights to the counties of Bentheim and Steinfurt. The court case about the parts of the counties in Prussia lasted until 1829; the trial about the parts in Hanover lasted even longer. Prince Alexius ultimately won both court cases. Incidentally, the County of Bentheim had been pledged to Hanover long before his reign. In 1823, Alexius redeemed this loan. He began the restoration of the run-down Bentheim Castle. He built a spa around the sulphur-rich springs in the town of Bentheim. The town would change its name to Bad Bentheim in 1979, to reflect its status as a spa town. Alexius was a member of the provincial parliament of the Prussian province of Westphalia. In 1847, he became a member of the short-lived United Parliament. In 1854, he officially became a member of the Prussian House of Lords; however he was never an active member.  Marriage and issue  In 1811, he married Wilhelmina of Solms-Braunfels, first daughter and child of William Christian Carl, 3rd Prince of Solms-Braunfels. They had six children, including his heir Louis William.  References  * Christina Rathgeber (ed.): Die Protokolle des Preußischen Staatsministeriums 1817–1934/38, vol. 1: 19. März 1817 bis 30.

Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature. The condition has been linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant. Treatment of the hypokalemia, followed by correction of the hyperthyroidism, leads to complete resolution of the attacks. It occurs predominantly in males of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent. TPP is one of several conditions that can cause periodic paralysis. Signs and symptoms An attack often begins with muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is followed by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or the early hours of the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected. Attacks may be brought on by physical exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why attacks are more common in summer when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur during a period of rest immediately after exercise; exercise may, therefore, be recommended to abort an attack. There may be symptoms of thyroid overactivity, such as weight loss, a fast heart rate, tremor, and perspiration; but such symptoms occur in only half of all cases. The most common type of hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease, may additionally cause eye problems (Graves' ophthalmopathy) and skin changes of the legs (pretibial myxedema). Thyroid disease may also cause muscle weakness in the form of thyrotoxic myopathy, but this is constant rather than episodic. Causes =Genetics= Genetic mutations in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) have been described in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in a different part of the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single- nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4). Of people with TPP, 33% from various populations were demonstrated to have mutations in KCNJ18, the gene coding for Kir2.6, an inward-rectifier potassium ion channel. This gene, too, harbors a thyroid response element. Certain forms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)--especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8--are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays a central role in the immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain whether this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known autoimmune disease. =Thyroid disease= The most common underlying form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome due to an autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis, toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Mechanism ATP in doing so. The muscle weakness and increased risk of irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles. It is not clear how the described genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females. TPP is regarded as a model for related conditions, known as \\"channelopathies\\", which have been linked with mutations in ion channels; the majority of these conditions occurs episodically. Diagnosis Hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels) commonly occurs during attacks; levels below 3.0 mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often found to be decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced. TPP is distinguished from other forms of periodic paralysis (especially hypokalemic periodic paralysis) with thyroid function tests on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism. Treatment The non-selective beta blocker propranolol can rapidly improve the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including attacks of TPP. In the acute phase of an attack, administration of potassium will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised as the total amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for potassium levels to overshoot (\\"rebound hyperkalemia\\"); slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced. The effects of excess thyroid hormone typically respond to the administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline and its effect on the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated. Treatment of the thyroid disease usually leads to resolution of the paralytic attacks. Depending on the nature of the disease, the treatment may consist of thyrostatics (drugs that reduce production of thyroid hormone), radioiodine, or occasionally thyroid surgery. Epidemiology TPP occurs predominantly in males of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent, as well as Thais, with much lower rates in people of other ethnicities. In Chinese and Japanese people with hyperthyroidism, 1.8–1.9% experience TPP. This is in contrast to North America, where studies report a rate of 0.1–0.2%. Native Americans, who share a genetic background with East Asians, are at an increased risk. The typical age of onset is 20–40. It is unknown why males are predominantly affected, with rates in males being 17- to 70-fold those in females, despite thyroid overactivity being much more common in women. History Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal After several case reports in the 18th and 19th centuries, periodic paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed the high rate of thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon has been used as a diagnostic test. In 1974 it was discovered that propranolol could prevent attacks. The concept of channelopathies and the link with specific ion channel mutations emerged at the end of the 20th century.

Constituent members include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, United States Virgin Islands, Virginia, and West Virginia. Early history The creation of the SSEB can be traced to the Southern Governors Conference meeting in Point Clear, Alabama, which on October 20, 1955 approved the \\"Point Clear Plan\\" whereby Southern states would coordinate the possible development of civilian uses of nuclear energy in the region. The agreement led to Florida Governor LeRoy Collins convening a preliminary energy conference on January 25, 1956 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Also attended by Tennessee Governor Frank Clement, representatives of fifteen Southern and Border states, as well as nuclear energy experts, additional meetings were held at Raleigh, North Carolina, Aiken, South Carolina and a March 1, 1956 meeting in Miami, Florida. Under the auspices of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), Gov. Collins convened a \\"Work Conference on Nuclear Energy at Redington Beach, Florida on August 1, 1956, which urged Southern governors to create \\"statewide atomic energy citizens advisory committees\\". These efforts resulted in the creation of a Regional Advisory Council on Nuclear Energy\\" (RACNE), which first convened in Atlanta on February 1–2, 1957, with representatives from 14 states in attendance. Administrative support for the Council, originally provided by SREB, was transferred to the Council of State Governments's regional office. By September 1961, with eight states having ratified a RACNE-drafted proposed interstate compact, RACNE became the \\"Southern Interstate Nuclear Board\\" (SINB), the precursor to the SSEB, which then was officially sanctioned by enactment of Public Law 87-563, filed by Senator Albert Gore, Sr., of Tennessee and signed into law by President John F.

Forming out of an upper-level low pressure system on November 29 near the island of Rarotonga, or roughly 1,470 mi (2,365 km) southeast of Fiji, Trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in the same general area for over a week. Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65 km/h (40 mph). After finally succumbing to wind shear on December 2, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later. As a result of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains impacted the same area for more than a week, resulting in severe flooding. Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. Following an assessment of the damage, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino. Meteorological history Tropical Cyclone Trina was identified by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), on November 18, 2001 as an upper-level low west of Rarotonga, an island situated roughly 2,355 km (1,465 mi) east-southeast of Fiji. Little development took place over the following ten days as the low gradually made its way to the surface. Situated in a region of relatively low wind shear, the system acquired subtropical characteristics before deep convection formed around its center. Late on November 29, the FMS upgraded the low to a tropical depression and assigned it the identifier 01F. However, the system later entered an area unfavorable to tropical cyclogenesis, consisting of increasing shear and marginally warm sea surface temperatures, estimated between . Drifting westward, convection managed to increase despite unfavorable conditions, as the low passed roughly 45 km (30 mi) southwest of Rarotonga on November 30. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, stating a \\"good\\" chance of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48 hours. Although the center remained partially devoid of convective activity, the system was declared Tropical Depression 06P by the agency within hours of the alert. Later on November 30, the depression further intensified into a tropical cyclone and was given the name Trina by the FMS. At this time, gale-force winds were only present in one quadrant of the storm. In previous years, gale-force winds had to be present all around the center for the system to receive a name. Upon receiving its name, Trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) along with a barometric pressure of 995 mbar (hPa; 29.38 inHg). Remaining nearly stationary, Trina succumbed to strong wind shear during the evening of November 30. The JTWC only classified Trina as a tropical storm for 12 hours before downgrading the system and issuing their final advisory early on December 1. However, according to the FMS, the system retained gale-force winds through December 2, by which time it was situated about 70 km (45 mi) northwest of Mangaia. Now significantly displaced from any convective activity, the remnants of Trina persisted in the same general area for several more days before completely dissipating. Impact and aftermath Cyclone Trina succumbing to wind shear hours after being named on November 30 Following Tropical Depression 01F's upgrade to Tropical Cyclone Trina on November 30, the Cook Islands were placed under a cyclone alert. Gale warnings were also put in place for the islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia for several days. Air New Zealand flights and many social events were canceled to ensure public safety. Due to the low intensity of the storm, the main threat was not wind damage, although gusts up to 100 km/h (65 mph) were reported in Rarotonga. Owing to the slow movement of the storm, heavy rains associated with Trina fell on Mangaia for nearly eight days, resulting in widespread flooding. Parts of the island were inundated with up to of water, destroying nearly 95% of the taro crop and drowning numerous livestock. Several of the islands' main roads were washed out and a few reports of landslides were made. The flooding on Mangaia was regarded as the worst in almost 50 years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due to the amount of soil being washed out to sea. Despite initial reports that the local water supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents. Offshore, a sailboat was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and was on the verge of sinking. The sailor managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore. The flooding on Mangaia persisted for nearly a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, the full extent of damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National Disaster Management Council, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from the United Nations was eventually requested on December 12, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply. A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the United Nations to assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm. By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands. In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was later retired.

The word was coined by Petr Skrabanek and James McCormick. The authors asserted that there is some degree of overdiagnosis of scoliosis in school, which causes ethical, social, and economic damage to the welfare of children.Gérvas J. Escuoliosis. Acta Sanitaria. 2010-07-26 Such overdiagnosis is called \\"schooliosis\\" by some academics. Schooliosis is a type of disease mongering.PLoS Medicine Disease Mongering Collection. PLoS Medicine. 2006/04/11. Preventive medical screening in school or college may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of scoliosis that triggers a series of unnecessary medical interventions on adolescents. There can be diagnostic and therapeutic cascades involving several specialists, which can end with iatrogenic damage to a healthy child with a normal back. The risks are unnecessary overexposure to X-rays (repeated diagnostic X-rays), rehabilitation techniques with side effects (traction), stigmatizing orthopaedic treatment (braces for back injury) and costs in time, travel, etc. The term has also been used in a non-medical sense for students' inability to imagine themselves as graduates.

Today, right now — instead of striving for the essence of the ozone, you give yourself to it with all your heart, beat by beat. No matter where you are – in small or larger zones — do not engage in measuring your soul, don't rage! When every tree branch radiates its love in the eternal prayer to the Sun, may no one cast a shadow from above — not treason, and not strontium. Don't run! Be still, be quiet, thus remain: if only every tiny bird, or even little dew of pain reflected in the eyes of the Eternal Son with love. Only in pure and silent inflorescence that lies now at His feet, you will cognize a fiery wing of parting and an assurance that you’ve overcome and can defeat yourself.

For instance, the natural numbers are semi-infinite considered as a subset of the integers; similarly, the intervals (c,\\\\infty) and (-\\\\infty,c) and their closed counterparts are semi-infinite subsets of \\\\R. Half-spaces are sometimes described as semi-infinite regions. Semi-infinite regions occur frequently in the study of differential equations.Bateman, Transverse seismic waves on the surface of a semi-infinite solid composed of heterogeneous material, Bull. Amer.

For instance, one might study solutions of the heat equation in an idealised semi-infinite metal bar. A semi-infinite integral is an improper integral over a semi-infinite interval. More generally, objects indexed or parametrised by semi-infinite sets may be described as semi-infinite.Cator, Pimentel, A shape theorem and semi-infinite geodesics for the Hammersley model with random weights, 2010. Most forms of semi-infiniteness are boundedness properties, not cardinality or measure properties: semi-infinite sets are typically infinite in cardinality and measure.

The film is a screwball comedy, in which Christy Sloane (Parker) is a legal secretary from San Francisco who is sent to Los Angeles to inform radio host Peter Lockwood (MacMurray) that he has just inherited $2 million. Plot Christabel \\"Christy\\" Sloane (Parker) is a legal secretary in San Francisco whose desire for finer things is hampered by her desperate financial straits, causing her to lament to her coworker Patsy (Una Merkel) that she needs to find a millionaire to marry. Her boss orders Christy to go to Los Angeles to inform Peter Ulysses Lockwood (MacMurray) of an inheritance of 28,000,000 pesos ($2,000,000) that a deceased uncle has bequeathed him and obtain the necessary legal documents. The pragmatic Patsy sees the assignment as the opportunity Christy has been waiting for and counsels her to romance the heir before telling him of his good fortune. Christy is not inclined to a gold digger, but Patsy's words ring in her ears as she makes the journey. Unbeknownst to her, Peter is \\"the Sunshine Man,\\" the self-promoting and simpering host of a radio program on which he offers syrupy homilies and moral tales about \\"spreading the sunshine around\\" (often linked to the products of his sponsors). Christy arrives on Peter's wedding day as he is scurrying to get dressed for the ceremony and finish packing for a honeymoon cruise to Honolulu with his bride, heiress June Chandler. When Christy knocks on Peter's apartment door, she is surprised by his good looks and impulsively swoons in his arms. The half- dressed Peter, baffled by the mysterious woman's appearance and with his living room cluttered by his luggage, carries her to his bed. Christy \\"awakens\\" and acts seductively, but Peter, in reality a notorious ladies' man, believes she is mentally unstable and is unmoved. Just then his friend, psychiatrist Roland \\"Doc\\" Cook (Richard Carlson), who despite his irritation over losing June to Peter is to be best man at the wedding, enters the apartment and assumes that Peter is having one last fling before his marriage. While Christy is trying to explain her mission from his bathroom, Peter is in the living room trying to convince Doc that appearances are not what they seem and does not hear her. Christy follows Peter and Doc to the Chandler mansion where the wedding is being held. Doc refuses to be part of the wedding, and a bewildered Christy inadvertently gives the impression that she is Peter's girl friend, whom he has abandoned for June. Christy's erratic behavior and insistence that Peter has inherited a fortune in pesos convince everyone that she is unbalanced. The wedding is called off until Peter can clear himself by driving Christy to Doc's clinic in La Jolla to confirm her instability. During the trip, fog rolls in and Peter drives off the highway onto a beach, where he loses the car keys. The wet and weary couple are found by a group of Mexican railroad workers, who, mistaking them for newlyweds, welcome them into their crew car on a nearby siding. After enjoying a night of dancing and drinking tequila with the Mexicans, Peter and Christy go out into the moonlight and kiss. In the morning, Peter apologizes to Christy for making the advances as the car is being towed to La Jolla. Doc talks with Christy, who explains everything, and confirms the truth with her boss. Doc bemoans the fact that while his clinic is facing financial ruin, Peter has just come into a fortune of his own, but also deduces that Christy is in love with Peter. Hoping to regain June for himself and Peter for Christy, Doc conspires with her to perpetuate her \\"illness\\" for 24 hours while he tricks Peter into \\"letting her down gently\\" in order to effect a cure. After putting up Peter in his own room and installing Christy in the same hotel, Doc summons June, who finds Peter again succumbing to Christy's charms. Doc, however, persuades June that Peter was just following Doc's therapy. The glum Doc and Christy get drunk together in the hotel bar, where one of Peter's Sunshine Man broadcasts makes Doc want to make him \\"eat his words.\\" They approach Peter and June to \\"share\\" their bottle of tequila. After several drinks, Peter, still believing that he is humoring Christy, is cajoled by the jealous June and intoxicated Doc to pledge his entire inheritance to various La Jolla charities, including Doc's clinic. The next morning, a hungover Peter is awakened by the press and a stream of well-wishers, all congratulating him on his generosity. Upon learning that he really did inherit two million dollars and has given it away, Peter is dumbfounded and believes he owes Christy an apology for thinking that she was crazy. June angrily warns him not to see her again but he knocks on Christy's door anyway, only to see her leaving. Peter chases her into a train station, where she hides in the ladies room. Peter declares his love for her, and literally smokes her out with burning newspapers. The happy couple escape pursuing police and reporters by jumping aboard a train carrying their Mexican friends.

On the Cape is the Rodoni Castle, built by Skanderbeg in 1463. and a Saint Anthony Church. Further south in the bay between the cape and Rrushkull Reserve there exist several beach resorts like Fshati Turistik Lura while Lalzit Bay Resort is under construction. Name The name Redon appears in ancient inscriptions found in Santa Maria di Leuca (present-day Lecce), and on coins minted by the Illyrian city of Lissos, suggesting that he was worshipped as the guardian deity of the city, and probably as a sea god. The fact that Redon was always depicted on coins wearing a petasos demonstrates a connection with travelling and sailing, which led historians to the conclusion that Redon was the deity protector of travellers and sailors. Indeed, the inscriptions of Santa Maria di Leuca were carved by the crews of two Roman merchant ships manned by Illyrians.; Inscriptions mentioning Redon were also found on coins from the Illyrian cities of Daorson and Scodra, and even in archaeological findings from Dyrrhachium after the establishment of a Roman colony there. His name keeps on being used in the Albanian Kepi i Rodonit, which could be analysed as an Illyrian sanctuary dedicated to the god of the sailors in the past.

The development includes three retail units (Rolex, McLaren Automotive and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank) totalling and 86 residential properties marketed with prices starting at around £20 million. Ownership The building is owned by Project Grande (Guernsey) Limited, a joint venture between the Christian Candy-owned CPC Group and Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, former Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar. Graham Stirk led the team at Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners who designed the building, built by Laing O'Rourke It was financed via a £1.15 billion development loan from Eurohypo AG. Candy & Candy were the development managers and interior designers for the scheme. History Search for Enlightenment Planning consent for the building was granted in June 2006. Demolition of the previous building on the site - the 1950s office block Bowater House - took place between July and December 2006. Construction work began in January 2007. The superstructure of the building was completed in March 2009. Fitting-out of the building began in April 2009. In August 2010, a penthouse in the development was rumoured to be sold for £140 million, making it the most expensive residential property in Britain. It was also announced that McLaren Automotive would be opening a car showroom in the building in early 2011. As part of the construction of One Hyde Park, a new entrance to Knightsbridge tube station was built. This opened in December 2010 In January 2011, a newspaper report at the time of the development's launch party indicated that according to Land Registry records the sale of only five properties had been completed. As of 2013, there was little evidence of people actually living in the complex. In September 2013 it was reported that a one- bedroom apartment in the complex worth £5.25m had been repossessed. The sculpture Search for Enlightenment by Simon Gudgeon was unveiled on 19 January 2012 to mark the first anniversary of One Hyde Park. The bronze sculpture is of two human profiles, one male and the other female and faces Hyde Park and the Serpentine.  Tax issues In November 2011 it was reported that only nine out of the 62 apartments that had been sold at One Hyde Park were registered with Westminster City Council for Council Tax. Despite prices ranging from £3.6 million for a one-bedroom flat to £136 million for a penthouse, only four properties were paying the full £755.60 a year Council Tax plus the £619.64 Greater London Authority charge (collectively below the national average), while five were paying the Council Tax at the 50% reduction for a second home. Westminster North MP Karen Buck stated: \\"When council spending is under unprecedented pressure, it is scandalous that residents in luxury apartments can avoid their share of council tax liability.

Perioperative nurses work closely with surgeons, anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, surgical technologists, and nurse practitioners. They perform preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care primarily in the operating theatre.http://www.Healthtimes.com.au Perioperative nursing offers some of the most exciting, demanding, and well-paid work in the nursing world. Also known as operating room nurses or OR nurses, perioperative nurses are registered nurses (RNs) who work in hospital surgical departments, day-surgery units (also called ambulatory surgery units), clinics, and physicians' offices. They help plan, implement, and evaluate treatment of the surgical patient and may work closely with the patient, family members, and other health care professionals.  Becoming a perioperative nurse  To work in the OR in a preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative nursing role, you must have a degree in nursing and pass the NCLEX-RN licensing exam. Your nursing education should include supervised clinical experience in surgical nursing, critical care or emergency room care to show you know what it takes to work in a fast- paced, high-stakes care environment. Many hospitals offer perioperative internship programs to gain this practice experience. These can include AORN's Periop 101 curriculum,Periop 101 curriculum, AORN a widely recognized program that offers RNs exposure to the latest surgical nursing standards of care and is used in over 2,500 hospitals across the United States.  Perioperative nursing salary  Surgical nursing salaries start just under $70,000 for staff nurses and can increase to well over $100,000 for OR nurses working in advanced clinical and administrative positions. Saturday, May 30, 2020 Perioperative nursing roles Perioperative nurses may perform several roles depending on the country they practice in, including circulating, instrument (or scrub) nurse, preoperative (or patient reception) nurse, Post Anaesthetic Care Unit or recovery nurse, registered nurse first assistant (RNFA), and patient educator.http://www.acorn.org.au =Circulating nurse= The circulating nurse is a perioperative nurse who assists in managing the nursing care of a patient during surgery. The circulating nurse observes for breaches in surgical asepsis and coordinates the needs of the surgical team. The circulating nurse is not scrubbed in the case but rather manages the care and environment during surgery. =Instrument nurse= An instrument (scrub) nurse is a perioperative nurse who works directly with the surgeon within the sterile field. The instrument nurse manages the sterile equipment, anticipates the surgeon's needs, and passes instruments and other items required during the procedure. Other duties include surgical site skin preparation, sterile draping, suctioning, irrigation, and retraction. The title comes from the requirement to scrub their hands and arms with special disinfecting solutions. =RN First Assistant= An RNFA is the surgeon's assistant and is extremely qualified in providing extended perioperative nursing care. The role also includes preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care of the patient. =Perianaesthesia nursing= The perianaesthesia nurse (recovery nurse) provides intensive nursing care to patients after they wake from anaesthesia. This nurse cares for and monitors patients to make sure they are not nauseated or disoriented.

A., The Preparation of Crystalline Zirconium Phosphate and Some Observations on Its Ion Exchange Behaviour. J Inorg Nucl Chem 1964, 26 (1), 117-129. Zirconium phosphates have high thermal and chemical stability, solid state ion conductivity, resistance to ionizing radiation, and the capacity to incorporate different types of molecules with different sizes between their layers. There are various phases of zirconium phosphate which vary in their interlaminar spaces and their crystalline structure. Among all the Zirconium phosphate phases the most widely used are the alpha (Zr(HPO4)2∙H2O) and the gamma (Zr(PO4)(H2PO4)∙2H2O) phase. Zirconium phosphate have been widely used in several applications such as: drug delivery,Díaz, A.; David, A.; Pérez, R.; González, M. L.; Báez, A.; Wark, S. E.; Zhang, P.; Clearfield, A.; Colón, J.

Crystal structure Zirconium phosphate crystal structure was elucidated by Clearfield and coworkers in 1968 by the single-crystal method.Clearfield, A.; Smith, G. D., Crystallography and structure of α-zirconium bis(monohydrogen orthophosphate) monohydrate. Inorg. Chem. 1969, 8, 431-436. The layered structure of α-Zirconium phosphate consists of Zr(IV) ions situated alternately slightly above and below the ab plane, forming an octahedron with the oxygen atoms of the tetrahedral phosphate groups. Of the four oxygen atoms in the phosphate groups, three are bonded to three different Zr atoms, forming a cross-linked covalent network. The fourth oxygen atom of the phosphate is perpendicular to the layer pointed toward the interlayer region. In the interlayer region is localized a zeolitic cavity where a basal water molecule resides, forming a hydrogen bond with the OH group of the phosphate that is perpendicular to the layer. The alpha phase of zirconium phosphate is under the P21/n space group, with cell dimensions of a = 9.060 Å, b = 5.297 Å, c = 15.414 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 101.71° and Z = 4.21 The basal interlayer distance for the α-Zirconium phosphate is 7.6 Å, where 6.6 Å is the layer thickness and the remaining 1 Å space is occupied by the interstitial water molecules in the interlayer gallery. The distance between adjacent orthophosphates on one side of the layer is 5.3 Å.Troup, J. M.; Clearfield, A., Mechanism of ion exchange in zirconium phosphates. 20. Refinement of the crystal structure of α-zirconium phosphate. Inorg. Chem. 1977, 16, 3311-3314. There are two phosphates in each ab plane in the surface layer forming a “free area” of 24 Å2 associated to each phosphate group.Clearfield, A.; Costantino, U., Layered Metal Phosphates and their Intercalation Chemistry. In Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry, 1 ed.; Alberti, G.; Bein, T., Eds. Pergamon: New York, 1996; Vol. 7, pp 107-149. For the gamma phase (γ-Zirconium phosphate), unfortunately, an appropriate single crystal for single-crystal structure determination has been futile to obtain. In 1995 Clearfield and coworkers elucidated its structure using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) and the Rietveld refinement method.Poojary, D. M.; Shpeizer, B.; Clearfield, A., X-Ray-Powder Structure and Rietveld Refinement of γ-Zirconium Phosphate, Zr(PO4)(H2PO4)∙2H2O. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1995, 111-113. The structure of γ-Zirconium phosphate consists of Zr(IV) atoms octahedrally coordinated to four different oxygen atoms of an orthophosphate. The other two resting octahedral position of the Zr(IV) atoms are occupied by two different dihydrogen phosphate groups. The orthophosphate molecules are located alternatively above and below the ab main plane and the dihydrogen phosphates are in the layer edges crosslinked by two of their oxygen atoms to two different zirconium atoms. The remaining two hydroxyl groups of the dihydrogen phosphate are pointing toward the interlayer gallery forming a pocket where a hydrogen bond is formed with the interlayer water molecules. The basal interlayer distance for γ-Zirconium phosphate is 12.2 Å, and the area surrounding the dihydrogen phosphate on the surface of the layers is 35 Å2.Curini, M.; Rosati, O.; Costantino, U., Heterogeneous Catalysis in Liquid Phase Organic Synthesis, Promoted by Layered Zirconium Phosphates and Phosphonates.

History The Wriezener Bahnhof was built in 1903 at the end of a short spur from Lichtenberg station, as the dedicated terminus of the Wriezener Bahn (Berlin-Wriezen-Godkównow in Poland), opened in 1892. From 1903 to 1924, it was a simple Bahnsteig (platform) part of the Schlesischer Bahnhof,The modern Ostbahnhof named Schlesischer Bahnhof (Wriezener Bahnsteig), and it was not until 1924 that it was renamed \\"Wriezener Bahnhof\\". In 1949 the station was closed to passenger traffic and used as a goods and mail station. Historical infos on www.eisenbahn-berlin.de In 2005 the tracks were removed and, in late 2006, a Metro supermarket and a Hellweg store were built in its place. Nowadays the area, owned by Deutsche Bahn, is probably earmarked for future estate projects. Future projects in the area of the Wriezener Bahnhof (on DB website) The old station building is the only surviving structure, and two roads (Am Wriezener Bahnhof and Wriezener Karree) remind us of the existence of the station.

A member of the Teschen branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Bohemia, Hungary, and Tuscany by birth, she renounced her titles in 1909 upon her marriage to Prince Jerome Radziwiłł. Background and early life Archduchess Renate was the second daughter of Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria and his wife, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Princess of Tuscany. Both of her parents were closely related to Emperor Franz Joseph. Renata’s father was a grandson of Archduke Karl of Austria who had led the Austrian army against Napoleon Bonaparte. Her father was also a brother of Queen Maria Christina of Spain. Renate’s mother, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Princess of Tuscany was a granddaughter of Leopold II, the last reigning Grand Duke of Tuscany, and of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. Archduchess Renate was educated by private tutors with a special emphasis on languages. She learned German, Italian, English, French and, from 1895, Polish. Her father had followed a career in the Austrian Navy and Renate spent her formative years primarily in Istria in the then Austrian port of Pula on the Adriatic. Her father was very wealthy and the family had a winter residence in the island of Losinj in the Adriatic, a palace in Vienna and in 1895 her father inherited from Archduke Albert vast properties in Galicia. From 1907 the family’s main residence was in Żywiec Castle in western Galicia. Marriage Archduchess Renate and her husband Prince Jerome Radziwill, 1909 Archduke Charles Stephen put aside his career in the navy and centered his ambitions in creating a Polish branch of the house of Habsburg. He encouraged all of his children to become Polish and Archduchess Renata ended up marrying one of Poland's richest landowners, Prince Jerome Radziwill. Their engagement was announced in September 1908. The Radziwiłł family was one of the most distinguish families of Poland, but since he did not belong to a ruling family, Renata had to renounce all of her titles, along with the style of Imperial and Royal Highness. They signed a prenuptial agreement and separation of property. The wedding took place on 15 January 1909 in the chapel at Żywiec Castle. They had six children and lived at Balice Castle, one of the Radziwiłł estates. Her eldest son, Dominik, eventually married Princess Eugénie of Greece and Denmark in 1938. With the defeat and dissolution of the Austrian Hungary Empire after World War I, the destiny of her family was even more closely linked to Poland. Archduchess Renata lived at Balice Castle in Poland, where she died on 16 May 1935. Her husband outlived her for ten years. Prince Jerome remarried. Towards the end of World War II, Prince Jerome was captured by Russian troops and he was taken behind the Iron Curtain. He died in a concentration camp in May 1945. The Radziwiłł properties were all lost. Children Archduchess Renate and Prince Jerome Radziwiłł had six children: *Princess Maria Teresa Radziwiłł (19 January 1910 - 1973 ) *Prince Dominic Rainer Radziwiłł (23 January 1911 – 19 November 1976); married, firstly, Princess Eugénie of Greece and Denmark and had issue.

Based in Manchester, England, the label have recently released their 120th release as of January 2019, and will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2019. The label also run a management arm, Melodic European Labels, which manages a number US & Australian labels in Europe, such as Carpark & Daptone. The current active Melodic roster includes artists such as W. H. Lung, Working Men's Club, Stephen Steinbrink, Cool Ghouls, Working for a Nuclear Free City, and L. Pierre. Acts that have been represented by the label include Man Of Moon, The Drink, Febueder, Dark Dark Dark, K-X-P, Malcolm Middleton and David Shrigley, Paume, Archie Pelago & Grenier, Patterns, Howes, The Soundcarriers, Windmill, Michael A Grammar, The Longcut and Eddy Current Suppression Ring. Melodic's first release was the debut EP from Pedro (aka James Rutledge) in 1999. Over the years the label has been active they have released records for the likes of Baikonour, Topo Gigio, Department of Eagles, The Isles, Outputmessage, Harrisons, ARMS, The Earlies, Micah P Hinson, the Nine Black Alps, Dungen, Minotaur Shock and Psapp. The label's latest release, which came out on 5 April 2019, was the debut album from Manchester trio W. H. Lung, a long-awaited psych-rock / post-punk release. The record is the 9th in the DINKED Edition limited vinyl series. They recently announced the signing of two new acts, Strawberry Guy & The Cool Greenhouse, along with the upcoming debut EP of Strawberry Guy, which will be released 27 September.  History  Label manager & founder David Cooper started in the industry at Pomona, a music PR company then based in Hebden Bridge. Before deciding to set up his own label to release the debut EP of ambient electronic musician Pedro. In its early years, the label went on to release singles and albums for electronic artists Minotaur Shock, L.Pierre (A guise of Arab Strap's Aidan Moffat) and Baikonour. The first release to move away from the electronic music that at that point defined the label was the debut 7\\", of Sheffield indie band The Harrisons. At that time a peer of The Arctic Monkeys, the band were a leading force in the so-called New Yorkshire scene. By the time The Harrisons had released their debut album in 2008, a large proportion of the Melodic roster were showcasing a more guitar-leaning side to the label. By signing Manchester bands Working For A Nuclear Free City & The Longcut, along with New Yorkers The Isles & Department Of Eagles, a new era of Melodic was born. Working For a Nuclear Free City signed to Melodic Records in 2006, and released their self- titled debut album the same year, the first of four albums they would put out on Melodic. Spanning 10 years, their entire career was spent with Melodic, with the band gaining attention throughout, particularly for 2007 single 'Rocket'. Nottingham Kraut-Rock / Psych-Pop band The Soundcarriers were signed to the label in 2009, and released their first two albums on Melodic. In the following years, releases included more L. Pierre content, as well as new acts Dark Dark Dark and K-X-P, the former of which was to find critical and commercial success with their albums Wild Go and Who Needs Who, as well as with a 2014 soundtrack album for the film Flood Tide. More recently, Stephen Steinbrink has been the flagship artist for the label, releasing all three of his albums through Melodic, and his brand of well-crafted indie-folk has seen him earn critical acclaim from the likes of Pitchfork and Loud & Quiet. His debut 'Arranged Waves' was released in 2014, followed by 'Anagrams' in 2016 and last year's 'Utopia Teased'. During that period, there was also time for albums from US garage acts Cool Ghouls & Bonny Doon, two albums for London's The Drink, as well as the final L. Pierre album, '1948-'. Released only on vinyl with no sleeve, '1948-' was a concept album based around the first ever vinyl record, which is heavily sampled throughout the LP. This year, Melodic has taken a heavy focus on local artists, signing West Yorkshire trio Working Men's Club, as well as releasing the debut LP from Manchester's W. H. Lung this April. Working Men's Club's debut single Bad Blood sold out of its initial pressing on pre-order, and spent a month and a half on the BBC 6 Music playlist. The young band take cues from Orange Juice and Talking Heads, and are currently touring the UK, impressing crowds with their high energy, instrument-swapping live sets. W. H. Lung's debut album Incidental Music was released on 5 April 2019, selling out both its limited clear vinyl and its DINKED edition. Coming out to critical acclaim, the album received glowing reviews from Loud & Quiet, Q Magazine, Mojo, Uncut & The Guardian. The band will tour the UK in May to support the album. The label have recently signed another north-west based young artist, the Dream-pop singer Strawberry Guy. The debut EP of Strawberry Guy will be released through Melodic on 27 September.

Born in Llanharan Worgan was notable for becoming the Welsh featherweight champion in 1944. Personal history Worgan was born in Llanharan in 1917 and was one of six brothers. A coal miner by occupation, he worked at the local pit, Llanharan Colliery. In 1959 he and his wife Dilys became owners of the Bear Inn in Llantrisant and kept the establishment until his retirement in 1985.Witts (1988) p. 219Llantrisant:Public houses Llantrisant.net Boxing career Although Worgan had no history of boxing in his family, he became interested in the sport when he was given a pair of boxing gloves by his only sister, Elizabeth.Lee (2009) p. 245 He turned professional at the age of 18 and in his career is reported to have fought in approximately 150 bouts, though as of 2010, BoxRec has only 51 recorded contests.Witts (1988) p. 218 He began training in the small Turberville room on Chapel Road just off Llanharan Square, before moving to the High Corner yard. His trainers at this time were Billy Watkins and Bert Harris. On his way to his 1944 challenge for the Welsh featherweight title, Worgan met several of Britain's best fighters. He lost to two lightweight ex-champions, Len Beynon in 1939 and Cuthbert Taylor in 1940, but he also took wins over George Pook, a future South-West featherweight champion and Warren Kendall who would become Welsh lightweight champion in 1948. Worgan made headlines in 1941 when he faced the World number two Ritchie \\"Kid\\" Tanner of British Guyana, beating him on points. In 1942 Worgan, now under the management of ex-fighter Billy \\"Kid\\" Hughes, faced his most notable adversary Nel Tarleton. Tarleton was the Commonwealth champion who in 1934 lost on points to Freddie Miller for the NBA title in 1934. The match was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March and was scheduled for eight rounds. The match went the distance with Worgan losing on a points decision. Despite being beaten Worgan later commented that 'Nel was one of the greatest in the game.' Worgan faced Tarleton on another two occasions, losing both on points decisions, in Liverpool in 1942 and Nottingham in 1943. On 11 November 1944, Worgan fought Tommy Davies from Nantyglo for the vacant Welsh featherweight title. The fifteen-round match was contested in Newport, south Wales with Worgan taking the bout on points. Worgan continued fighting until 1949 with irregular results.

[26 June 1644 N.S.]) - 30 June 1670) was the youngest daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Princess Henrietta Maria of France. Fleeing England with her mother and governess at the age of three, Henriette moved to the court of her first cousin, King Louis XIV of France, where she was known as Minette.Barker, p. 75 She married her other cousin Philippe I, Duke of Orléans and became known Fils de France,Barker, p. 72 but their relationship was marked by frequent tensions over common suitorsBarker, p. 78 Very clever, Henrietta was instrumental in negotiating the Secret Treaty of Dover against the Dutch Republic in June 1670, the same month as her unexpected death. Jacobite claims to the British throne following Henry Benedict Stuart's death descend from her daughter Anne Marie, Queen of Sardinia. Infancy in England A posthumous painting by Peter Lely of Princess Henrietta commissioned by her brother King Charles II and presented by him to Exeter Guildhall, in the Council Chamber of which it still hangs today, in recognition of her birth in Bedford House, Exeter, the town house of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford who had given her mother refuge during the dangerous years before her father's execution in 1649 Princess Henrietta was born on 16 June 1644, on the eve of the Second Battle of Newbury during the Civil War, at Bedford House in Exeter, a seat of William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford (1613–1700), who had recently returned to the Royalist side. Her father was King Charles I of England, her mother the youngest daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici. All her life, Henrietta would enjoy a close relationship with her mother, Queen Henrietta Maria. Her connections with the court of France as niece of King Louis XIII and cousin of Louis XIV would prove to be very useful later in life. Shortly before the birth of Henrietta, her mother had been forced to leave Oxford for Exeter, where she had arrived on 1 May 1644. Many thought she would not survive the birth due to her state of health at the time.Cartwright, p. 3 After a particularly difficult birth, the princess was put in the care of Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton, known at that time as Lady Dalkeith.Cartwright, p. 4 For the safety of the infant princess, the queen decided to make her way to Falmouth and then return to France to ask Louis XIV to assist her husband's war efforts. Arriving at Falmouth in mid-July, the queen was informed that the infant princess had been taken ill with convulsions, from which she recovered. On 26 July, Henrietta met her father, Charles I of England, for the first time. Prior to his arrival, the king had ordered that the princess would be baptised in accordance with the rites of the Church of England, and she was baptised Henrietta at Exeter Cathedral on 21 July.Fraser, p 32 A canopy of state was erected in honour of her dignity as a Princess of England.Cartwright, p. 5 Henrietta was moved to Oatlands Palace outside London, where the princess and her household lived for some three months before fleeing secretly in June 1646, Lady Dalkeith ensured Henrietta's safe arrival in France where she was re-united with her mother.Cartwright, p. 13 Life and marriage in France While living at the French court, the princess was given the name Anne in honour of her aunt, the French queen Anne of Austria. When she first arrived, she was known as Henrietta d'Angleterre or the princesse d'Angleterre in France. She and her mother were given apartments at the Louvre, a monthly pension of 30,000 livres and the use of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. This lavish establishment soon diminished as all the money Queen Henrietta Maria received was given to her husband in England or to exiled cavaliers who had fled to France.Cartwright, p 18 During the Fronde, the civil war that raged in France between 1648 and 1653, Henrietta and her mother stayed at the Louvre. In February 1649, Henrietta's mother was informed of the execution of her husband Charles I, who had been beheaded on 30 January. At the end of the Fronde, Queen Henrietta Maria and her daughter moved into the Palais Royal with the young Louis XIV and his mother and brother Philippe. At the same time, Queen Henrietta Maria decided to have her daughter, who had been baptised in the Church of England, brought up as a Catholic.Cartwright, pp. 25 - 28 With the arrival of Henrietta's brother, Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester, in 1652, their small court was increased. Henrietta as Minerva holding a painting of Monsieur, by Antoine Mathieu After the Fronde was over, the French court made it a priority to find a bride for the young king of France. Queen Henrietta Maria hinted at the idea of a union between Henrietta and Louis, but Queen Anne rejected the idea, preferring instead her niece by blood, Maria Theresa of Spain.Fraser, p. 67 Louis and Maria Theresa married in June 1660, after which Queen Anne turned her attentions to her unmarried son Philippe. While residing at the Château de Colombes, Henrietta Maria's personal residence outside Paris, mother and daughter heard of the restoration of the monarchy in England under Henrietta's brother Charles II of England,Cartwright, p. 68 and they returned to Paris. This change of fortunes caused the flamboyant Philippe, a reputed bisexual who had been party to a series of sexual scandals, to ask Henrietta to marry him. Prior to this, rumours at court stated that Henrietta had received various proposals from Charles Emmanuel of Savoy and the Grand Prince of Tuscany but nothing came of them as a result of her status as an exile.Cartwright, p. 62 An impatient Philippe was eager to make sure he married Henrietta as soon as possible, but Queen Henrietta Maria was intent on going to England to sort out her debts, secure a dowry for Henrietta and prevent the Duke of York's announcement of his marriage to Anne Hyde, a former maid-of-honour to the Princess Royal.Cartwright, p. 67 During this time, Henrietta became distraught when her brother the Duke of Gloucester died of smallpox in September 1660.Cartwright, p. 69 In October, Henrietta and her mother embarked at Calais for Dover, where they stayed at Dover Castle. The French court officially asked for Henrietta's hand on 22 November and her dowry was arranged. Charles II agreed to give his sister a dowry of 840,000 livresBarker, p 125 and a further 20,000 towards other expenses. She was also given, as a personal gift, 40,000 livres annually and the Château de Montargis as a private residence.Cartwright, p 70 Henrietta's return to France was delayed by the death from smallpox of her elder sister Mary, Princess of Orange. She finally left England in January 1661. She and Philippe signed their marriage contract at the Palais Royal on 30 March 1661; the ceremony took place the next day.Cartwright, p 81 The marriage was elaborately celebrated and she and her husband moved into the Palais des Tuileries.Cartwright, p 90 As she had married Monsieur, Henrietta was styled Madame, la duchesse d'Orléans.Fraser, 321 The marriage started well and Philippe seems to have been a doting husband. A year into the marriage, Henrietta gave birth to a daughter later baptised Marie Louise. The paternity of the child was doubted by some of the court, who insinuated Louis XIV or the Count of Guiche was the father. Henrietta and Guiche may have started an affair early in her marriage, despite his having been an alleged former lover of Philippe.Cartwright, p 106 These flirtations caused a once-adoring Philippe to become intensely jealous and he complained to Queen Anne. Soon after, Louis started an affair with one of Henrietta's ladies-in-waiting by the name of Louise de La Vallière, who had joined her household at the end of 1661 and had protected Henrietta with regard to the affair of Guiche. The couple's next child was a son born in July 1664 who was given the title Duke of Valois. The son, however, died in 1666 of convulsions after being baptised Philippe Charles hours before death. The loss of the little Duke of Valois affected Henrietta greatly.Barker, p 115 She gave birth to a stillborn daughter in July 1665,Mitford, p 87 but another daughter was born in 1669 who was baptised Anne Marie in 1670. In 1666, her husband's most prominent alleged lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine, became attached to the Orléans householdCartwright, p 239 - Lorraine would often vie for power within Philippe's household, an unusual arrangement for the time. Henrietta has often been praised as a cultured princess and her correspondence with Moliere, Racine, La Fontaine, Bussy-Rabutin and others is notable.Cartwright, p 179 She was also a lover of gardening, and it was she who created a water garden at the Palais Royal.Fraser, p 76 Henrietta also amassed a large and prestigious picture collection that included paintings by Van Dyke and Corregio.Fraser, p 77 Her active personality has caused historians to think that she showed signs of Anorexia nervosa.Fraser, p 155 Late in 1669, Henrietta lost her mother Queen Henrietta Maria, who died after having taken an excessive quantity of opiates as a painkiller.White, Michelle A: Henrietta Maria and the English Civil Wars. Aldershot, Ashgate Publishing, 2006, p 193 Henrietta was devastated, and the situation was not helped by Philippe's immediate rush to claim all her possessions before she had even been buried. =Secret Treaty of Dover= Henrietta was instrumental in diplomatic negotiations between her native England and adopted France. Her brother Charles II, to whom she had always been very close (it was he who gave her the nickname Minette), had been trying to establish a closer relationship with France since 1663, but it was not until 1669 that he set the wheels in motion by openly admitting that he would become a Catholic and vowing to bring England back to Catholicism. Henrietta was eager to visit her homeland and Louis XIV encouraged her in order for the treaty to take place. Philippe, however, annoyed with Henrietta for flirting with Guiche and his previous lovers, remained adamant that she should not be allowed to go complaining to Charles II that she should remain at his side in France. Appealing to Louis XIV, she managed to arrange to travel to England, where she arrived in Dover on 26 May 1670, remaining there until 1 June, the day the treaty was signed.Fraser, p 151 Charles was to abandon England's Triple Alliance with Sweden and the Dutch Republic in favour of assisting Louis XIV in conquering the Dutch Republic, which he claimed for his wife Queen Marie Thérèse as part of her unpaid dowry. Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that ran through the Dutch Republic. The treaty did not become public until 1830.Fraser, Antonia: Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1979, p 276 After her time in England, she returned to France on 18 June.Cartwright, p 336 Death, burial and aftermath In 1667 Henrietta began complaining of an intermittent, intense pain in her side. Beginning in April 1670, according to reports, Henrietta began having digestive problems so severe that she could consume only milk.Baron, p. 214 Returning to France after the treaty, Henrietta went to stay at Saint Cloud with her husband on 26 June.Fraser, p 153 On 29 June, at five o'clock, Henrietta drank a glass of iced chicory water. According to reports, immediately after drinking the water she felt a pain in her side and cried out, \\"Ah! What a pain! What shall I do! I must be poisoned!\\"Cartwright, p 345 She immediately assumed she had been poisoned and asked both for an antidote and for someone to examine the chicory water. She was given common contemporary treatments for colic, as well as anti-poisons. The royal family arrived at Saint Cloud having heard the news within hours. Bishop Bossuet was called and later administered Extreme Unction. At 2 o'clock in the morning of 30 June 1670, Princess Henrietta died. The Chevalier de Lorraine and the Marquis d'Effiat were rumoured by many to be accomplices in poisoning Henrietta, among them Philippe's second wife, Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine,H. F.

Henrietta was interred at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis on 4 July, another service was held on 21 July. All chief public bodies including the Parliament, courts of Law, Assembly of the Clergy, and the City Corporations were represented, as well as members of the nobility and general public. Queen Maria Theresa was present with the emeritus King of Poland, John II Casimir, and the English Ambassador, the Duke of Buckingham. French Princes of the blood were present as well as masses of the nobility. \\"Last of all came the members of Monsieur and Madame's household, bearing torches in their hands. A mausoleum, surrounded with altars and silver urns, and adorned with a crowd of mourning allegorical statues, among which Youth, Poetry and Music were conspicuous, had been erected in the centre of the choir. There the coffin rested, covered with cloth of gold, edged with ermine, and embroidered with the arms of France and England in gold and silver. Everyone having taken their places hundreds of candles burst into flame giving a cloud of incense; and the Archbishop of Reims assisted by other bishops, began the Mass, which was chanted by the King's musicians organised by Lully.\\"Cartwright, p 383 Monsieur married again in 1671 to Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, who, like Henrietta, was descended from Mary, Queen of Scots, sharing James VI of Scotland and I of England as a common ancestor.Barker, p 123 Monsieur and the \\"new Madame\\" would have a further two surviving children. Henrietta's eldest daughter Marie Louise died, like her mother, at the age of 26 in Spain in 1689.Fraser, p 277 The circumstances of her death were almost identical to those of her mother's death, and she was also believed to have been poisoned.Baron, p. 215 Anne Marie married in 1684 and was the mother of some eight children, the eldest of whom, Princess Maria Adelaide, was the mother of Louis XV. Monsieur himself would die in 1701.Barker, p 234 Her descendants include Jacobean claimants to the English throne, Henri, Count of Paris, the Orléanist pretender to the French throne, the king of Spain, the king of the Belgians, the grand duke of Luxembourg and the pretender to the Italian throne.Barker, p 239 Issue daughter of France #Marie Louise d'Orléans (26 March 1662 - 12 February 1689) married Charles II of Spain, no issue. #Miscarriage (1663).Weir 2011, p. 254. #Philippe Charles d'Orléans, Duke of Valois (16 July 1664 - 8 December 1666) died in infancy. #Stillborn daughter (9 July 1665). #Miscarriage (1666). #Miscarriage (1667). #Miscarriage (1668).Weir 2011, p. 255. #Anne Marie d'Orléans (27 August 1669 - 26 August 1728) married Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy (future king of Sardinia) and had issue.

It is known from a single species, T. ruthae, first described in 1998 from the Middle Triassic Chañares Formation in Argentina. Partial remains have been found from deposits that are Anisian-Ladinian in age. Long known mostly from osteoderms, vertebrae, and fragments of the skull, specimens described in 2017 provided much more anatomical details and showed that it was a fairly large predator. Tarjadia predates known species of aetosaurs and phytosaurs, two Late Triassic groups of crurotarsans with heavy plating, making it one of the first heavily armored archosaurs. Prior to 2017, most studies placed it outside Archosauria as a member of Doswelliidae, a family of heavily armored and crocodile-like archosauriforms. The 2017 specimens instead show that it belonged to the Erpetosuchidae.  Etymology  The genus name Tarjadia is derived from Sierra de los Tarjados, the closest mountain range to the outcrops of the Los Chañares Formation where remains have been found. The type species T. ruthae was named in honor of Ruth Romer, wife of the American paleontologist Alfred Romer, who led a Harvard expedition to Los Chañares in 1964 and 1965. Ruth went with Alfred on the expedition and was the first woman to work in the locality.  History  The first remains of Tarjadia from the Chañares Formation were mentioned by Alfred Romer in 1971. He recognized two types of osteoderms from the formation, which he tentatively attributed to the rauisuchian Luperosuchus because of their large size and similar appearance to scutes of other rauisuchians. In 1990, more complete osteoderms were found from the formation, as well as associated vertebrae. Three years later, in Romer's collections at Harvard University, remains of a skull were found in association with an osteoderm that was similar to the ones described in 1971 and 1990. This allowed Tarjadia to be erected as a new genus, distinct from Luperosuchus. = Specimens = The initial 1998 description of Tarjadia ruthae listed several specimens: * PULR (Museo de Paleontologia at Universidad de La Rioja) 603 (holotype):6 complete osteoderms, 3 osteoderm fragments, and at least 6 fragmentary vertebrae. * MCZ 9319: A fragmentary skull roof and braincase, a fragment of the lower jaw, and an osteoderm fragment. * MCZ 4076: 4 osteoderms. In 2016, Ezcurra considered MCZ 4077 (a partial femur and osteoderm fragments), which had previously been referred to Luperosuchus and even used in a study of the histology of that genus, as actually referable to Tarjadia. Additional specimens from various parts of the Chañares Formation were described in 2017, greatly expanding knowledge of the animal. These specimens include: * CRILAR ( Centro Regional de Investigaciones y Transferencia Tecnológica de La Rioja, Paleontología de Vertebrados)-Pv 463b: 6 osteoderm fragments. * CRILAR-Pv 477: A partial skeleton, not including the skull. * CRILAR-Pv 478: A partial skeleton, including a partial skull. * CRILAR-Pv 479: The tip of a dentary, 7 vertebrae, 2 osteoderms, and rib fragments. * CRILAR-Pv 495: A nearly complete skull and lower jaws. * CRILAR-Pv 564: 2 vertebrae, 2 teeth, and other fragments. * CRILAR-Pv 565: A partial skeleton including the rear part of a skull. * CRILAR-Pv 566: A partial braincase. Description = Osteoderms = Tarjadia has been diagnosed on the basis of its osteoderms, or bony scutes, the most common material that has been found of the genus. The paramedian osteoderms, which overlie the back to either side of the midline, are thick and rectangular. Their medial edges are serrated, allowing the two rows to suture tightly together. Smaller, more rounded osteoderms are thought to have been placed to the sides of the paramedians, although no articulated remains bearing these lateral osteoderms have been found to prove this. Both the paramedian and lateral osteoderms are deeply pitted. The paramedian osteoderms are thickest at the center and medial edges, with spongy bone between the compact outer layers. = Skull = The bones of the skull table are very thick. Like the osteoderms, they are covered in coarse pitting. The surfaces of these bones also bear perforations for blood vessels, especially around the edges of the orbits, or eye sockets. The parietal bones, which lie between two openings on the skull table called supratemporal fenestrae, have a distinctive sagittal crest. On the underside of the parietals, there is a depression for the olfactory bulb of the brain, responsible for the perception of smell. An olfactory channel leads up to this depression and can be seen on the underside of the frontal bones. The fragmentary occipital area of the skull (the base of the skull) shows part of the boundary of the foramen magnum (through which the spinal cord enters the skull), channels for the vestibular system (part of the inner ear responsible for balance), and holes for the semicircular canal (also part of the vestibular system). These holes and channels are found on the supraoccipital bone. The exoccipitals and opisthotics are also known in Tarjadia, and form the paraoccipital processes, two projections for the attachments of muscles that open the lower jaw. These processes form notches that may be tympanic fossae, cavities of the middle ear. = Vertebrae = The vertebrae of Tarjadia have centra, or central bodies, that are about as long as they are high. The centra have concave ventral surfaces and depressed lateral surfaces. The neural spines that project upward from the centra are laterally compressed, but have distal portions that expand into a flattened table with a groove on its upper surface. Above the flat tables of the neural arches lie the paramedian osteoderms, which also form a flat surface. Thick transverse processes on some vertebrae suggest that they make up the sacrum, the area of the spine that attaches to the pelvis. The six vertebrae known from Tarjadia probably represent the posterior dorsals, sacrals, and first caudals, comprising the end of the back vertebrae and the beginning of the tail vertebrae. Classification Comparisons between Tarjadia and other Triassic archosaurs and archosauriforms were made in its initial 1998 description. The archosauriforms Doswellia and Euparkeria, as well as the archosauriform family Proterochampsidae, all have heavy armor over the dorsal vertebrae and existed around the same time as Tarjadia. Proterochampsids do not have ornamented osteoderms like Tarjadia, nor do they have two rows of osteoderms on either side of the back (most proterochampsids, with the exception of Cerritosaurus and Chanaresuchus, have only a single row on either side). While Euparkeria has a pair of osteoderms overlying each vertebra, similar to the condition seen in Tarjadia, its osteoderms aren't ornamented. Ornamented paired osteoderms are seen as derived conditions in Doswellia and crurotarsan archosaurs. Some studies have not considered Tarjadia to be a close relative of Doswellia because of differences in the structure of the vertebrae. Moreover, Tarjadia possesses a prefrontal bone in the skull which is absent in Doswellia. Among crurotarsans, vertebrae that are each overlain by a single row of pitted, paired osteoderms as in Tarjadia are seen in aetosaurs, phytosaurs, and Crocodylomorpha. Tarjadia has been distinguished from aetosaurs by its apparent lack of an anterior articular lamina (a depressed region along the front of each osteoderm), and clear differences in the skull tables. Tarjadia differs from sphenosuchians and proterosuchians, the two main Triassic crocodylomorph groups, in that its osteoderms lack any clear structures on the anterior edges of the osteoderms. In the case of sphenosuchians, the anterior edge of the osteoderm forms a process or \\"lappet\\", while in protosuchians, the anterior edge has a depressed band similar to those of aetosaurs. Out of all Triassic crurotarsans, the osteoderms of Tarjadia bear the closest resemblance to those of phytosaurs; they have a similar shape and are also heavily pitted. Moreover, the skull roof of is also pitted in phytosaurs. However, Tarjadia can be distinguished from all phytosaurs in that it has differently shaped parietal bones. The strong sagittal crest on the parietals of Tarjadia is not seen in any phytosaur. When it was first erected in 2011, the family Doswelliidae was proposed to include Doswellia, Archeopelta, and Tarjadia. Synapomorphies, or unique features of the group, include coarsely pitted and incised osteoderms and an anterior articular lamina. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Ezcurra et al. (2017) did not confirm a close relationship between Tarjadia and Doswellia; instead, Tarjadia was recovered as an erpetosuchid pseudosuchian archosaur. The cladogram of the strict consensus tree from the study is given below.
