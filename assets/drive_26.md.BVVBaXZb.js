For this range we have to apply Incompressible Navier Stokes and Euler equations but the work would be much easier if we find a Unified Method for solving both the flows. Unified method can also lead us towards much more accuracy and efficiency. Why the standard method for solving Compressible flows fails? The basic cause of failure for the Compressible Flow methods is the stiffness of the governing Equations.  Conservation of Mass  \\\\frac{\\\\partial{}\\\\rho{}}{\\\\partial{}t}+ abla{}.\\\\left(\\\\rho{}V\\\\right)=0  Conservation of Momentum  \\\\rho{}\\\\frac{DV}{Dt}=- abla{}p+ abla{}.\\\\tau{}+\\\\rho{}f  Conservation of Energy  \\\\rho{}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial{}h}{\\\\partial{}t}+ abla{}.\\\\left(hV\\\\right)\\\\right]=-\\\\frac{Dp}{Dt}+ abla{}.\\\\left(k abla{}T\\\\right)+\\\\Phi{} One way to fix this problem is to change the governing equation; known as Preconditioning; which can also increases the accuracy. The other cause for the break down is Pressure because it is not taken into account as primary unknown. For making the governing equation workable for both the Compressible and Incompressible flows, following things needs to be corrected:- • Usage of Dimensionless Pressure thereby removing the difficulties faced while solving for very low Mach Number • Use non Conservative form of energy which increases the efficiency. • Discretization of the mass conservation equation • Use MUSCL and Runge Kutta time stepping  Governing Equation  = Conservation of mass = {\\\\rho{}}_pp_t+{\\\\rho{}}_TT_t+m_x=0 = Equation of state = {\\\\rho{}}_p=\\\\gamma{}M_r^2/T {\\\\rho{}}_T=-\\\\frac{\\\\rho{}}{T} = Momentum Equation = m_t+{(um+p)}_x=0 By using the dimensionless pressure and equation of state the governing equation can be best described as : T_t+{(uT)}_x+\\\\left(\\\\gamma{}-2\\\\right)Tu_x=0  Finite Volume Scheme  For the above specified governing equations the finite volume scheme*Eymard, R.

Biography  Kristensen was born in Riis Mark, Ousted on 20 August 1887 as son of farmer Johannes Kristensen and 43-year-old wife Karen Marie née Nielsen and baptized in Ousted church on the 20th Sunday after Trinity the same year. In addition to being a member of the Hvidsten group Kristensen was also a coach builder. The group helped the British Special Operations Executive parachute weapons and supplies into Denmark for distribution to the resistance. In March 1944 the Gestapo made an \\"incredible number of arrests\\" including in the region of Randers where a number of members of the Hvidsten group were arrested. The following month De frie Danske reported that several arrestees from Hvidsten had been transferred from Randers to Vestre Fængsel. On 29 June 1944 Kristensen and seven other members of the Hvidsten group were executed in Ryvangen.  After his death  On 15 July 1944 De frie Danske reported on the execution of several members of the Hvidsten group. Six months later the January 1945 issue of the resistance newspaper Frit Danmark (Free Denmark) reported that on 29 June the previous year Kristensen and seven other named members of the Hvidsten group had been executed. On 5 July 1945 Kristensen's remains and those of five others from the group were found in Ryvangen and transferred to the Department of Forensic Medicine of the university of Copenhagen where an inquest the same day showed that he was executed with gunshot wounds to the chest. The remains of the two remaining executed members of the group, Marius Fiil and his son Niels had been found in the same area three days before. On 10 July he was together with the seven other executed group members cremated at Bispebjerg Cemetery. In 1945 a memorial stone over the eight executed members of the Hvidsten group was raised near Hvidsten Inn.Memorial stone for the Hvidsten group in Hvidsten Similarly a larger memorial stone for resistance members including the eight executed members of the Hvidsten group has been laid down in Ryvangen Memorial Park.Memorial stone in Ryvangen for resistance members including the Hvidsten group Portrayal in the media * In the 2012 Danish drama film Hvidsten Gruppen (This Life) Søren Peter Kristensen is portrayed by Arne Siemsen.

Cancelled 2018 and 2020 World Series Prior to the 2017 America's Cup, several of the competing syndicates Oracle Team USA, Land Rover BAR Team UK, Team France, Softbank Team Japan, Metro Artemis Team Sweden signed an agreement to hold World Series prior to the next two America's Cups, then scheduled for 2019 and 2021. These two World Series would be used as selection series to determine which teams would compete at the 2019 and 2021 Louis Vuitton Cups Challenger Selection Series. These two seasons would have used the AC50-class yachts, instead of the AC45 or AC45F classes. However, the winner of the 35th America's Cup, Emirates Team New Zealand was not a signatory to the agreement for the 36th and 37th America's Cup, making these plans obsolete.

Such materials include natural biodegradable polymers, synthetic biodegradable polymers, and biodegradable blends. The use of biodegradable materials is a long-term solution to landfill pollution that can significantly help protect the natural environment by replacing the synthetic, non-biodegradable polymers found in athletic footwear. Problem of non-degradable waste The United States athletic shoe market is a $13 billion-per-year dollar industry that sells more than 350 million pairs of athletic shoes annually. The global footwear consumption has nearly doubled every twenty years, from 2.5 billion pairs in 1950 to more than 19 billion pairs of shoes in 2005. The increase in demand for athletic shoe products have progressively decreased the useful lives of shoes as a result of the rapid market changes and new consumer trends. A shorter life cycle of athletic footwear has begun to create non-degradable waste in landfills due to synthetic and other non-biodegradable materials used in production. The considerable growth in industrial production and consumption has made the athletic footwear industry face the environmental challenge of generated end-of-life waste. Ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer The athletic shoe midsole is one of the main contributors that lead to a generation of end-of-life waste because it is composed of polymeric foams based on ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). EVA is a polyolefin copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate that provides durability and flexibility, making it the most commonly used material found in athletic shoe midsoles.Chen, Nan. \\"The Effects of Crosslinking on Foaming.\\" Diss. U of Toronto, 2012. Abstract. (2012): n. pag. Print. Although the synthetic polymer is a useful material for the athletic shoe industry, it has become an environmental concern because of its poor biodegradability. EVA goes through an anaerobic decomposition process called thermal degradation that often occurs in landfills resulting in releases of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air.Costache, Marius C., David D. Jiang, and Charles A. Wilkie. \\"Thermal Degradation of Ethylene- vinyl Acetate Copolymer Nanocomposites.\\" Polymer 46.18 (2005): 6947-958. Web. VOCs \\"contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone, which is harmful to humans and plant life.\\"Albers, Kyle, Peter Canepa, and Jennifer Miller. \\"Analyzing the Environmental Impacts of Simple Shoes.\\" Diss. U of Santa Barbara, 2008. Abstract. (2008): n. pag. Print. Thermal degradation of EVA is temperature-dependent and occurs in two stages; in the first stage acetic acid is lost, followed by the degradation of the unsaturated polyethylene polymer. Thermal degradation of EVA by allylic scission. Environmental impact The environmental impacts of athletic shoe degradation in landfills \\"are inextricably connected to the nature of the materials.\\" The production of many petroleum-based products, such as EVA, used to manufacture athletic shoes result in serious environmental pollution of groundwater and rivers when disposed into landfills. When disposed of in landfills, athletic footwear can take up to thousands of years to naturally degrade. EVA athletic shoe midsoles can be kept in contact with moist soil for a period of 12 years and experience little to no evidence of biodeterioration.Katarzyna Leja, Grazyna Lewandowicz. \\"Polymer Biodegradation and Biodegradable Polymers-a Review.\\" Polish Journal of Environmental Studies 2nd ser. 19.2010 (2012): 255-66. Web. Although there are some that are taking initiatives to produce environmentally friendly athletic footwear, most of the footwear industry's response to this increasing problem of end-of-life shoe waste has been negligible. In order to reduce post-consumer waste and improve environmental properties of athletic shoes, biodegradable materials can help to replace synthetic polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate with the ability to compost at the end-of-life phase. Biodegradable materials \\"Biodegradation is a chemical degradation of materials provoked by the action of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae.\\" Although there are many materials categorized as biodegradable, there has been an increasing interest of biodegradable polymers that can lead to waste management options for polymers in the environment. These biodegradable polymers can be broken down into three categories: natural biodegradable polymer, synthetic biodegradable polymer, and biodegradable blends. =Natural biodegradable polymers= Natural biodegradable polymers are formed in nature during growth cycles of all organisms. When searching for natural fibers to replace synthetic materials in athletic shoes, the major natural biodegradable polymer that offers the most potential are polysaccharides. Starch is a polysaccharide that is useful because it readily degrades into harmless products when placed in contact with soil microorganisms.Díaz, Angélica, Ramaz Katsarava, and Jordi Puiggalí. \\"Synthesis, Properties and Applications of Biodegradable Polymers Derived From Diols and Dicarboxylic Acids: From Polyesters to Poly(Ester Amide)S.\\" International Journal of Molecular Sciences 15.5 (2014): 7064-7123. Academic Search Complete. Web. 20 Oct. 2014. Enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. Starch is not often used alone as a plastic material because of its brittle nature, but is commonly used as a biodegradation additive. Many plasticizers use starch- glycerol-water to modify starch's brittle nature.Wang, Xiu-Li, Ke-Ke Yang, and Yu-Zhong Wang. \\"Properties of Starch Blends with Biodegradable Polymers.\\" Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part C: Polymer Reviews 43.3 (2003): 385-409. Web. Biodegradation of this blend was tested and was found that by the second day the degraded carbon had already attained about 100% of the initial carbon of the sample. =Synthetic biodegradable polymer= Aliphatic polyesters are a diverse family of synthetic polymers of which are biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic.Renard, E., V. Langlois, and P. Guérin. \\"Chemical Modifications of Bacterial Polyesters: From Stability to Controlled Degradation of Resulting Polymers.\\" Corrosion Engineering, Science and Technology 42.4 (2007): 300-11. Web. Specifically, poly (lactic acid) has low melt strength and low viscosity properties that are similar to EVA midsoles in athletic shoes. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is part of the polyester group and can go through thermoplastic and foaming processes.Chandra, R. \\"Biodegradable Polymers.\\" Progress in Polymer Science 23.7 (1998): 1273-335. Web. Along with its good mechanical properties, its popularity is based on the non-toxic products that it becomes when it decomposes through hydrolytic degradation.Albertsson, Ann-Christine. Degradable Aliphatic Polyesters. Vol. 157. Berlin: Springer, 2002. Print. Hydrolytic degradation of PLA generates the monomer lactic acid, which is metabolized via the tri-carboxylic acid cycle and eliminated as carbon dioxide. Hydrolytic Degradation of the aliphatic polyester, PLA. =Biodegradable blends= Most synthetic polymers are resistant to microbial attack because of their physical and chemical properties. However, they can become biodegradable when introducing natural polymers such as starch. Natural polymers introduce ester groups that attach to the backbone of non-biodegradable polymers, making them more susceptible to degradation. Due to biodegradable polymers having limited properties; blending synthetic polymers can bring economic advantages and superior properties.Ma, Jianzhong, Liang Shao, Chaohua Xue, Fuquan Deng, and Zhouyang Duan. \\"Compatibilization and Properties of Ethylene Vinyl Acetate Copolymer (EVA) and Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) Blend Based Foam.\\" Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 71 (2014): 2219-234. Academic Search Complete. Web. Insertion of an ester group into vinyl polymer. End-of-life management Although total elimination of post-consumer waste is not encouraged by any current change- causing agent due to the enormous change in infrastructure that the elimination of waste requires and the consequent lack of profitability for those agents, proactive approaches to reduce the enormous amount of waste that 350 million pairs of athletic shoes create can make a difference in the environment. Biodegradable materials, such as biodegradable polymers, are a viable solution to aid in avoiding the end-of-life athletic footwear waste consumption.Song, J. H., R. J. Murphy, R. Narayan, and G. B. H. Davies. \\"Biodegradable and Compostable Alternatives to Conventional Plastics.\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 364.1526 (2009): 2127-139. Web. open access The major advantage of introducing biodegradable polymers to athletic footwear is the ability to compost with other organic wastes for it to become useful soil attendant products. An alternative short-term approach to end-of-life management is recycling activities in the footwear industry. One major shoe manufacture, Nike Inc., created Reuse-A-Shoe program that involves recycling discarded athletic shoes by grinding and shredding the shoes to produce a material called Nike Grind, which can be used in surfacing for tennis and basketball playgrounds or running tracks. Currently, the Reuse-A-Shoe program recycles approximately 125,000 pairs of shoes per year in the United States. Recycling and composting are two major proposed solutions to end-of-life management. However, the use of biodegradable materials is a long-term solution that can significantly help protect the natural environment by replacing synthetic, non-biodegradable polymers found in athletic footwear.

At the age of 18, she was taken in by her adoptive family as a filla de anima, a soul-child, a traditional Sardinian adoption. In contrast to the usual age of between 10 and 14 years, Murgia's adoption was delayed because of her natural father's opposition. Murgia attended the Lorenzo Mossa Oristano institute for technical studies, and then joined the Institute of Religious Studies of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Oristano to study theology. Murgia taught religious studies at middle and grammar schools in Oristano for six years. Career =Literary= Michela Murgia's first work, Il mondo deve sapere, was published in 2006. This was a satire on the telemarketing call centre, highlighting the economic exploitation and psychological manipulation of its workers. The book was dramatised for the stage by David Emmer and starred Teresa Saponangelo. It was also filmed by Paolo Virzì, and released in 2008 as Tutta la vita davanti. In 2008, Murgia wrote a travel book on her native Sardinia, Viaggio in Sardegna. Murgia's 2009 novel, Accabadora, gained several awards including the Mondello International Literary Prize and the Molinello Award for First Fiction. L'incontro, a novella, appeared in 2012. In 2013, Murgia co-authored a book titled L'ho uccisa perché l'amavo’. Falso! with Loredana Lipperini, which tackled the issues of violence on women in Italy.

Uniforms for members of the kazoku peerage and civil officials were officially set.  History  1869 Imperial visit to Tokyo When the Meiji Restoration began, those working to build the new government were wearing a diverse array of different clothing based on their social status during the previous Edo period. Nobles had their court wear and informal , samurai had the distinct and dress, and members of Westernized military forces had their Western-style uniforms. For example, during the Emperor's visit to Tokyo in 1868, opinions were divided between the high officials Nakayama Tadayasu and Date Munenari. Nakayama argued that ikan should be worn only when departing and when entering the castle, while kariginu would be worn en route; Date held that kariginu should be worn only when entering the castle, with and hitatare both allowed en route. As a result, it was decided that both kariginu and hitatare would be allowed en route, with ikan also permitted when entering the castle. Furthermore, the colors and designs on the ikan, kariginu, and hitatare were all unique to each individual, destroying the visual unity of the procession. Meanwhile, the soldiers guarding it were dressed in Western-style uniforms, but were not at all accustomed to the clothing. Ernest Satow commented that their slovenly appearances ruined the solemnity of the procession. This lack of uniformity was once again evident on the Emperor's repeat visit the next year. The situation was clearly untenable, and so after the election of officials to the new government in summer 1869, the Minister of Justice Saga Saneharu was put in charge of the problem. In a meeting of the legislature that winter, Iwakura Tomomi proposed deliberation over the court dress for governmental officials that Saga and his helpers had come up with. However, as this design was based on the former dress of court nobles, it met with opposition from those of samurai descent. In order to resolve this disorder, the was released on October 17, 1871. In order to quiet the kazoku still attached to traditional styles of dress, the order claimed that ikan and similar kinds of clothing were weak, and Japan should go back to the styles of the time of Emperor Jimmu and Empress Jingū. The \\"styles of that time\\" meant tight sleeves and narrow hakama, and so the order implied that Western-style dress, complying to these standards, had much in common with the essential garb of the Japanese themselves. Calling back to the spirit of Jimmu's legendary founding of the country, it appealed for the creation of a new uniform. On December 12, 1872, the Dajō-kan released an edictDajō-kan Edict No. 339 of December 12, 1872. . View here. implementing regulations for the uniforms of civil officials and nobles, and on December 29 of that year another edictDajō-kan Edict No. 373 of December 29, 1872. . View here. determined regulations for their wearing. The new official uniforms were indeed designed based on the court uniforms used in Europe at the time. The first of these edicts also designated white tie dress as the court dress of choice for those not entitled to any particular court uniform, such as private citizens. The uniforms for members of the Imperial Family were first decided by an edict of the Dajō-kan on February 22, 1873, and then updated in 1876 and 1911. After the Peerage Act of July 7, 1884, divided the existing kazoku into five ranks, the Ministry of the Imperial Household further established the uniforms for these new subcategories. On October 29 of the same year, another edict of the Dajō-kan created gown-type court uniforms for senior officials within palace agencies like the Board of Chamberlains and Board of Ceremonies. From 1888 to 1889, various other personnel were outfitted with uniforms and assigned court uniforms. The Imperial Household Agency's uniforms underwent major changes in 1911 and 1928. Fusako Kitashirakawa in the manteau de cour On June 23, 1886, provisions were set to determine formal Western wear for women. In order from most to least formal, these were the manteau de cour, robe décolletée, robe mi-décolletée, and robe montante. On December 4 of the same year, the designs of the court uniforms for civil officials were modified, but the designs for junior officials were not updated. Because the officials were responsible for providing their own court uniforms, the cost had been too much for junior officials. From this point on, junior civil officials wore standard white tie court dress. The difference in price was extreme: when the official Kikuchi Takeo ordered both a three-piece suit and his court uniform at the same shop, the suit cost 28 yen and the uniform 220 yen. On March 2, 1908, an Imperial edict established substitute court uniforms for diplomats dispatched to the tropics or very hot areas. Later, on September 29, 1926, another Imperial edict established alternative court uniforms and court dress for Japanese officials in the South Pacific. All of these consisted of white tunics. Old news footage shows officials of the South Pacific Mandate, including Kōki Hirota, in these clothes.Kōki Hirota is seen in Japan News No. 111 and No. 166; in No. 24 Although their names differed, naval and military officers also had dress corresponding to court uniforms. Unlike civil officials, military officials were allowed to wear their uniforms to personal ceremonies such as marriages and funerals. These various kinds of court uniforms continued to be used at court functions and ceremonies even into the Shōwa period, at events like the Imperial enthronement and the first visit of Emperor of Manchukuo Puyi to Japan.Video of Puyi's welcome at Tokyo Station（YouTube） However, as the strain of war continued, opportunities for their use became rarer and rarer. When Mitsumasa Yonai became Prime Minister during the Second Sino- Japanese War, his morning dress could not be tailored in time for the appointment, and he wore a naval uniform in its place at his official investiture.Concerned that becoming prime minister while still an active naval officer would infringe upon the Emperor's supreme command authority, Yonai transferred to the first reserve. His naval full uniform is on display at the Morioka Memorial Museum of Great Predecessors. After the war, Imperial Household Agency edicts and the pertinent Dajō-kan edicts were abolished, on May 2, 1947,Imperial Household Ordinance No. 12 of May 2, 1947. and July 1, 1954,Law No. 203 of July 1, 1954. respectively. The Empire of Japan's court uniforms disappeared with them, but similar male uniforms do remain in use around the world, including in France, various South American countries, and Thailand.  Court uniforms for civil officials  Genrōin members in 1879, wearing various court uniforms for civil officials by the 1872 designs. Three of the highest subcategories of civil officials were allocated specific court uniforms: , , and . These uniforms were officially decided by edict of the Dajō-kan on December 12, 1872. The Iwakura Mission, which had departed Japan earlier, also gathered information on uniform design via Hayashi Tadasu. However, the mission had no time to wait for a final decision before an audience with Queen Victoria. They therefore ordered uniforms in England, based on the designs they had been discussing with the homeland. Unfortunately, the designs they reported back were determined to be impossible to create in Japan's still-immature Western clothing stores and were not adopted directly. The versions ultimately decreed by the Dajō-kan differed considerably from the Iwakura mission's prototypes. The Dajō-kan's edicts were still incomplete as a form of law, and the details of the original edict itself were in some areas insufficient, so variations were visible depending on the manufacturer. There were also problems with the uniforms themselves. The pants for chokuninkan were designated as being white, but in Europe white pants were only worn in court uniforms on special occasions. This issue was even pointed out by Otto von Bismarck when the Iwakura mission visited Germany. On September 18, 1877, an edict of the Dajō-kan brought these pants into line with the coats, changing them to the same black wool material. Aiming to set clear and unified standards for the uniforms, the regulations were amended on December 4, 1886, by an order of the Ministry of the Imperial Household. Pictures and diagrams were published in an official telegram, and related manufacturers were provided with sample illustrations printed in color. The amendment was targeted at the uniforms for senior officials. Those of junior officials were not addressed and instead died out. A minor amendment from the same office on December 10, 1892, modified the side decorations on the uniforms of sōninkan. Correspondence between the Cabinet's chief clerk Kawasaki Takashi and Under-Secretary of the Army Hajime Sugiyama suggests that further modifications to civil officials' uniforms were being considered at the time of the 1928 changes to the uniforms of the Imperial Household Agency.

Those used on the coat rather than the hat decoration also had a raised rim about three rin (0.9 millimeters) across. ; Vest : A wool vest; white for chokuninkan, dark gray for sōninkan, and navy blue for hanninkan. After the September 18, 1877, edict of the Dajō-kan, black was also allowed for chokuninkan and sōninkan. ; Trousers : Wool trousers; white for chokuninkan, dark gray for sōninkan, and navy blue for hanninkan.

After the establishment of the five ranks (duke, baron, etc.) within the kazoku peerage, however, heads of titled households wore uniforms specific to their titles. According to the of May 4, 1887, people possessing the or above were entitled to treatment comparable to that of titled peers. Specifically, the junior first rank was to correspond to the title of duke, the senior second rank to a marquis, the junior second rank to a count, the senior third rank to a viscount, and the senior fourth rank to a baron. The uniforms for ranks above the fourth conformed to those of chokuninkan, and those for the senior fifth rank and above to those of sōninkan. However, they were decorated only with mon emblems, with no additional foliage scrollwork embroidery, and with one mon emblem, two sun (about six centimeters) in diameter, affixed at the small of the back. In the 1872 version, the hat plumage was black even for those above the fourth rank, and the stripes on the trousers were composed of embroidered lines of five bu (about 15 millimeters) across in a raimon pattern, while people of the fifth rank and below had single stripes of the same width. An edict of the Dajō-kan on October 8, 1877, added black wool trousers, and a May 27, 1911, Imperial Household ordinance changed the hat plumage for those of fourth rank or above to white.

Emperor Meiji in clothes based on a civil official's court uniform The continuing Westernization of the Emperor's clothing, food, and living conditions after the Meiji Restoration led to the need for Western , or Imperial garb. This was prepared in 1872, and resembled the court uniforms for civil officials. At the time, the Emperor still had a topknot, and so his hat was designed to contain it. However, the foreign government advisor advised that the emperor of France wore a military general's uniform, rather than that of a civil official. Shortly thereafter, new military-style gofuku, called or , were created. These gogunpuku were used until October 11, 1880, when another edictDajō-kan Edict No. 55 of October 11, 1880. of the Dajō-kan created a new uniform called the , based on the uniform of a general in the Japanese army. The 1880 edict was replaced on November 14, 1913, by an Imperial Household ordinance.Imperial Household Ordinance No. 9 of November 14, 1913. Along with a redesign of the army uniform-based outfit, a version based on naval uniform was also introduced. After this, the army- and navy-style uniforms were redefined and the corresponding ordinance modified whenever the base army and navy uniforms were themselves updated. When Japan lost the Second World War and the Imperial Japanese Army was dissolved in 1945, a new Imperial uniform was established.Imperial Household Ordinance No. 37 of November 7, 1945. However, this new uniform was abolished on May 2, 1947, along with all other Imperial Household Edicts.

Court uniforms for the Imperial Family  When the court uniforms for the Imperial Family were first established on February 22, 1873,Dajō-kan Edict No. 64 of February 22, 1873. the designs were more or less the same as those for court ranks, but with the paulownia crests replaced with the chrysanthemum seal. This made the Imperial Family's uniforms difficult to distinguish from those for court ranks, and so on October 12, 1876,Dajō-kan Edict No. 125 of October 12, 1876. they were updated with chrysanthemum foliage scrollwork. In 1911, the Imperial Household Ordinance on Imperial Family DressImperial Household Ordinance No. 3 of May 26, 1911. was promulgated, and an additional clause in it abolished the pertinent Dajō-kan edicts of 1873 and 1876. This order defined two levels of formal dress, changed the chrysanthemum foliage scrollwork to use a sakura motif instead, and specified fully closed mandarin collars. However, as Imperial Family members were now supposed to wear the uniforms of their offices if they held any, and most princes were appointed as officers in the military or navy unless there was a reason not to,Imperial Household Ordinance No. 2 of 1910. . Article 17. most wore military uniforms, and these new uniforms for the Imperial Family saw little actual use.

In 1886, the Imperial Guard were assigned both regular and court uniforms, and in 1888 the rest of the institutions of the Ministry of the Imperial Household were allocated their own. In 1889, chokuninkan and sōninkan of the Crown Prince's Household got both formal and informal court uniforms,Ministry of the Imperial Household Order No. 26 of December 23, 1889. and in 1891 escort dress was created for high officials in the Agency.Ministry of the Imperial Household Order No. 3, Part 1, of November 24, 1891.

Description Hairlike pondweed is an aquatic perennial that dies back each winter into a large number of asexually produced resting bodies called turions. There are no rhizomes. It produces slender, cylindrical or slightly compressed, branching stems usually less than a metre in length but occasionally up to 2 m. The submerged leaves are long and very narrow, typically 16–80 mm long and 0.3–1 mm wide, with the midrib occupying up to 70% of the width of the leaf near the base. They are rigid and green turning darker with age. There are no floating leaves. The inflorescence is a short spike of 3–5 flowers arising from the water on a slender peduncle. This species readily hybridizes with several other species of Potamogeton including P. berchtoldii (P. × franconicus G.Fisch.), P. pusillus (P. × grovesii Dandy & G.Taylor) and P. compressus (P. × ripoides Baagøe). Hairlike pondweed is diploid, with 2n=26 chromosomes. Hairlike pondweed is one of the more distinctive fine-leaved pondweeds due to the characteristically stiff leaves dominated by the midrib and open but tightly rolled stipules. However, it tends to be rarer than other fine-leaved species and often grows in mixed beds with other fine-leaved water plants such as P. pusillus and Zannichellia palustris, so it may be overlooked. Taxonomy Potamogeton trichoides (trichoides = 'hairlike') was named by the German botanists Adelbert von Chamisso and Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal in 1827. Hairlike pondweed is one of the fine-leaved pondweed clade (series Graminifolii), and related to similar species such P. pusillus. Distribution Potamogeton trichoides is native to the western Palaearctic and Africa. It occurs in northern Europe (Austria, Britain, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy (including Sicily), Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, Russia, the Baltic States), North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt), eastern and southern Africa (South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe). There are outlying populations in the Canaries, the Caucasus, and Russia east of the Urals. Ecology and conservation Hairlike pondweed grows predominantly in standing water including ponds, lakes, ditches, canals and slow-flowing rivers and streams. It is usually restricted to calcareous water of rather high conductivity and is tolerant of high nutrient levels. It is often an early succession species, colonising newly created habitats such as ditches and flooded gravel pits, but sometimes is abundant in alkaline, low altitude lakes. It often grows with other nutrient tolerant macrophytes such as Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton crispus, P. pusillus and Ranunculus circinatus. In Britain, hairlike pondweed is thought to be stable or possibly increasing. However, it is placed in various threat categories in parts of its range, for example it is Vulnerable in the Czech Republic, and Germany (although still widespread along all major river systems there), and Critically Endangered in Switzerland. Cultivation Potamogeton trichoides is not in general cultivation, and is of little garden merit.

She also wrote many children’s books and books for those in the profession of providing library service to children and youth. Early life Olcott was born in 1872 in Paris, France near the Garden of the Batignolles. She later lived in Albany, New York at both her parents' and grandmother's houses; this was followed by years in the country suburbs of Albany where she was tutored by her parents who provided her with a formative education. Her father, Franklin Olcott, born in America, but educated in Göttingen and Würzburg in Germany, worked in the American Consular Service. He tutored her in German and the classics. Her mother, Julia Olcott, translated children’s stories from French. According to Olcott, her father's strong vocabulary, love for poetry, and researcher’s mind and her mother's fine critical powers, delicate feelings for words, and eager mind, helped to develop her intellectual skills and analytical abilities and had a strong influence on her writing. Olcott mentions the importance that her religious influences as a child had upon her writing as well. Her grandmother's formal and dignified religious influence was present alongside her parents’ Bible readings and daily prayers. She earned her high school certificate through Regents Examinations before taking entrance examinations for the New York State Library School where she graduated in 1896. Career =Librarian= Olcott was an assistant librarian of the Brooklyn Public Library from 1897–1898. She then became the first librarian to develop and head the Children's Department at Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and to organize a formal training program known as The Training School for Children's Librarians. Her children's department was a laboratory where she and her staff tested methods, evolved standards, and worked out problems regarding reading engagement, content selection, and material organization. Her team's results were published and shared with other libraries and schools; her educationally minded staff with two expert bibliographers helped eventually create what became her Carnegie-supported Training School for Children's Librarians. Olcott started outreach programs to bring books into homes, schools, detention centers, and beyond. Her efforts helped a large immigrant population at the time learn how to adapt to a new country. She promoted the idea of having home libraries for children, and she and her colleagues would set up a reading hour where groups of children would meet in a home in the community to be read to by the librarians. =Writer= In 1911 Olcott left both Pittsburgh and her position of librarian and moved back to New York to write books for children, and books on how to be an effective children's librarian. She wrote and edited more than 24 volumes, which sold in her lifetime for more than a half million dollars. She was asked to write the section \\"Library Works with Children\\" for the American Library Association 1914 Manual of Library Economy.

Background Hyde was born in Ottawa, in 1946, and is the son of the artist and film-maker, Laurence Hyde. During the 1960s, Hyde played a leadership role in the Canadian New Left, especially The Student Union for Peace Action, and his writing has always had a strong political element. His first novel, The Red Fox (1985), was a spy novel published in more than twenty countries, with a historical background that ranged from the Comintern in the 1930s to the development of an ultra-nationalist right in contemporary Russia. China Lake (1992) was set at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake (now the Naval Air Weapons Station). Its theme is the interface between science and the military, and its background is the development of rocketry from the Nazi era into the Cold War. Formosa Straits (1995) is set in China and Taiwan during the closing days of the Mao era, while Double Helix (1995) involves the development of a sex-selective contraceptive vaccine. Anthony Hyde's brother, Christoper Hyde (1949-2014) was also a novelist, author of The Wave (1979), A Gathering of Saints (1996) and other books. Writing as Nicholas Chase, the Hyde brothers together wrote Locksley (1983), a historical novel about Robin Hood. Hyde has written one non-fiction book, Promises, Promises (1997), that examined the role of political promises in Canadian political life. Hyde has written one novel outside of the thriller genre, A Private House (2007), about the psychological, sexual and religious adventures of two women, set in contemporary Havana. Hyde's Picture This (2007), written for ABC Literacy Canada, is part of the Good Reads Series of books, a program that provides exciting reading material for adult literacy classes.

He represents Jalisco as a federal deputy from the first electoral region to the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress. Life Sesma Suárez obtained his undergraduate law degree from the Universidad del Valle de México and his master's degree in economics from the UNAM; he worked at the law firm of Sesma, Sesma and McNesse. His career in PVEM politics began in 2001, when he began a three-year stint as the PVEM's Director of Institutional Relations. In 2005, he became the national PVEM's Secretary of Social Communication, a post he would hold through 2008. In 2006, Sesma Suárez was elected as an alternate deputy to the LX Legislature of the Mexican Congress for Sara Isabel Castellanos Cortés, representing San Luis Potosí from the second region. Castellanos permanently left the Chamber of Deputies effective April 26, 2007, prompting Sesma to be sworn in as a new federal deputy. In a two-year span, he served on seven commissions, including Economy; Special on the National Rural Accord and the Agriculture Chapter of the Free Trade Agreement; Foreign Relations; Government; Agriculture and Ranching; Culture; and Human Rights. Sesma returned to a legislature in 2012, this time as a local deputy to the VI Legislature of the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District. He was the PVEM parliamentary coordinator and presided over the Environmental Preservation, Ecological Protection and Climate Change Commission, in addition to serving on others dealing with the justice system, health and political reform. While a deputy, circus leaders slammed him for being a hypocrite; while he promoted measures that prohibited the use of animals in circuses, his wife posed for a photo shoot featuring mounted animals and fur coats. In 2015, Sesma Suárez was returned to the federal Chamber of Deputies, this time for the LXIII Legislature from Jalisco in the first region. He is the PVEM parliamentary coordinator and sits on the Political Coordination Board, as well as on the Jurisdictional, Rules and Parliamentary Practices, and Constitutional Points Commissions.

He studied with James Olney, who was the Voorhies Professor of English and an editor of The Southern Review. Academic contributions In an interview with Alexander, Bre Garrett summarizes his contributions to the field of composition studies: \\"Across almost two decades of work in the profession, Jonathan Alexander has contributed to vast conversations in the field of composition, and he has paved deliberate routes for cross- disciplinary studies that intersect sexuality, literacy, and technologies. Across a sea of publications directed toward diverse audiences, Jonathan has remained attentive to the relationship among bodies, poetic rhetorics, and platforms of public communication. In this interview, Jonathan provides readers with a forward-looking perspective about the possibilities and openness of composition as a complex research field, yet he also reflects on the challenges and constraints, some self-imposed, that composition now faces as an established discipline. Jonathan accounts for his inaugural moment as a researcher in composition, recalling how he discovered a methodological space where he could remain committed to his ongoing interest in sexuality studies, and integrate, what was at the time, his emerging interest in computerized pedagogies. Jonathan’s entrance in the profession coincided with critical cultural moments that adhered to his scholastic goals: Harriet Malinowitz’s 1995 publication of Textual Orientations, the visibility of computers and composition as a recognized research field, and a pedagogical orientation toward the “social turn.” As a teacher and administrator, Jonathan frequently questions and assesses—and must account for—composition's objects of study. He asks that as a field we continue asking the very question of what constitutes writing, and he calls for researchers to re-examine histories of actual composing practices. In his published work, both print texts and conference presentations, he experiments with form and poetic style, and he designs, often collaboratively, textual spaces that make explicit the place and performance of bodies in literate acts, bodies in rhetorical motion.\\" He was editor of College Composition and Communication from 2015-2020. He is also a frequent contributor to the Los Angeles Review of Books.

It argues that while supernatural claims made by religion are false, some aspects of religion are still useful and can be applied in secular life and society. Religion for Atheists was published in the UK in hardback edition by Hamish Hamilton, and in the US by Pantheon. Religion for Atheists was a New York Times non-fiction bestseller, and has been widely reviewed, with mixed results. Content Alain de Botton, c. 2012 Religion for Atheists has a general format in which de Botton describes a problem in society, discusses how religions (particularly Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism) have attempted to solve this problem, and proposes secular alternatives. Religion for Atheists draws on the work of the 19th century philosophers Auguste Comte, Matthew Arnold and John Stuart Mill. Religion for Atheists particularly pays attention to the way religions draw people's minds to ideas through annual ceremonies and rituals such as Christmas or the Day of Atonement. Religion for Atheists asserts that religions know that people are fundamentally children, in need of comforting and repeated guidance on how to live. The book is divided into ten chapters: Wisdom without Doctrine, Community, Kindness, Education, Tenderness, Pessimism, Perspective, Art, Architecture and Institutions. In an interview with New Scientist, de Botton stated his aim for atheists reading the book: \\"I want to make sure atheists are deriving some of the benefits of religion.\\" The chapter on \\"Kindness\\" discusses the tensions between libertarianism and paternalism. It argues that freedom has become vital in Western political thinking, and discusses suspicion of the idea that the state should talk about how we should behave to each other. De Botton contrasts this with religions, which he describes as having ambitious ideals about how people should treat each other. He suggests that religious ethics grew out of pragmatic needs, and that because they were key to our survival that it became important to protect them by pretending that they were divinely inspired. He sums up by saying that people simply have to be reminded that \\"the most mature and reasonable parts of us\\" (p. 80) want us to live this way. De Botton suggests the example of the Scrovegni Chapel, which has paintings of the \\"cardinal virtues\\" and their corresponding vices. People sitting in the church would think about their own relationships to these virtues and vices while they sat under a painting of God. De Botton suggests that advertising for values should be displayed in public spaces. The chapter on \\"Pessimism\\" describes that modern society, with its continual message of progress and improvement, seems to promise permanent happiness, but that we are still vulnerable to heartbreak and despair, even as our ancestors were. De Botton argues that religious pessimism allows religious people to be grateful for small successes, whereas \\"the secular world is not well versed in the art of gratitude\\" (p. 188). In the \\"Institutions\\" chapter, De Botton describes organised religions as being efficient at spreading their message, having financial clout and enacting social change, and compares them to corporations. Publication Religion for Atheists was published in the UK in hardback edition by Hamish Hamilton (later also by its parent Penguin), and in the US by Pantheon and Vintage International. A Greek translation has been published by Pataki, and a Swedish translation has been published by Brombergs. Reception Critical reception of the book has been mixed. It was the most-reviewed book of the week in January 2012, according to The Bookseller. David Brooks finds that the book makes atheism \\"kind of boring\\", like a \\"spiritual handicap\\".https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/alain-de-bottons- religion-for-atheists.html Terry Eagleton describes the book as an attempt to \\"hijack other people's beliefs, empty them of content and redeploy them in the name of moral order, social consensus and aesthetic pleasure\\". Angus Wood says that De Botton's proposed solutions feel \\"trite or feel crassly commercial\\", and that transferring the authoritarian methods of religion to a secular world looks \\"like indoctrination\\". Martha Gill, after reading Religion for Atheists, feels that \\"as a spiritual guide, de Botton offers as much opportunity for growth as a hard-boiled egg\\". Joe Winkler recommends A.C. Grayling's The Good Book, The Joys of Secularism, and Bertrand Russell's A Free Man's Worship over this book. Winkler finds the omission of positive psychology confusing in the book, and criticises De Botton's assumption that \\"because the mechanics used in a religious setting work, and have worked for thousands of years, they will work in a secular setting\\", and describes this assumption as naive at best and \\"slightly totalitarian\\" at worst. Despite his criticisms, Winkler recommends Religion for Atheists because he finds the book eloquent and thought- provoking. Christopher Hirst writes of the book: \\"De Botton has reduced religion to a mechanism\\", and describes the tone of the book as \\"bossy, but readable\\". James Croft describes the book as having a lack of balance, and under-valuing the achievements of humanity. Barney Zwartz says \\"De Botton selects areas of need - community, kindness, education, tenderness, perspective, architecture and art - and draws out detailed, practical lessons.\\" José Teodoro suggests the book is \\"subtly condescending in the way it demands that everything in our shared environment constantly remind us that we’re not alone in our anxieties and disappointments\\". The Economist, in a comparison with Roger Scruton's The Face of God, writes that de Botton \\"often stretches a good idea beyond its elastic limit\\". John Armstrong regards this book as not being part of 'militant Atheism', not arguing whether religion is true or not, but looking at its effects in people's daily lives. Stephen Cave, writing for the Financial Times regards a theme of Religion for Atheists to be \\"we are less grown-up than liberal societies assume we are and frequently in need of guidance, reassurance and tenderness\\". Richard Holloway, writing for the Literary Review notes that when examining the purpose of religion in life, \\"Along the way he rethinks the nature and purpose of higher education and national cultural policy.\\" and feels that the audience of the book is \\"a lot of uneasy believers [who] will welcome it like a well of water in a dry place\\". Marc Mohan suggests that an \\"ideal reader\\" of this book would be a religious person who doubts, but is hesitant to stop being religious because they fear that a life without religion is a life without ethics. The Telegraph's Tom Payne writes that the author continues from Ovid's assertion on the utility of gods: \\"It’s useful that there are gods, and that’s why we believe in them\\". According to Payne, De Botton argues that religion provides useful boundaries, in addition to inspiring a sense of awe. Payne praises De Botton's prose and charm, but notes that De Botton seems to find libertarianism distasteful. Payne describes the book as being both prescriptive and optimistic, but sums it up in the book's central premise - the hope that religion can be made to 'really suit us'. Charles Moore, writing for The Telegraph, states that De Botton's purpose in the book is to study religions and learn from them. Moore states that De Botton \\"has an instinctively religious grasp of the power of paradox\\" in that the concept of original sin is depicted in the book as \\"comforting\\". Moore suggests that De Botton knows that his suggested secular solutions to the problems of life are \\"mostly a bit silly\\", and notes that while De Botton discusses failed attempts at secular religion, like August De Comte's, De Botton 'does not seem to ask himself why' they failed. For Moore, religious 'uses' come from the 'truth' at the heart of religions, and De Botton does not recognise this. When published in the United States, the book placed on the New York Times' best seller list for hardcover non-fiction.https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers- books/2012-03-25/hardcover-nonfiction/list.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/best- sellers-books/2012-04-08/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html The reviewer for Bookmarks notes that critics have considered de Botton to be closer to C.S. Lewis and Augustine in his views, rather than the atheists Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, and that De Botton seems to delight in being subversive in Religion for Atheists, giving the book three stars out of five.Botton, Alain de. \\"Religion for Atheists.\\" Bookmarks May–June 2012: 56+. Literature Resource Center. Web. 27 Feb. 2015. A.N. Wilson, who had been an atheist but converted to Christianity, criticized first the amount of illustrations and blank pages in the book. Wilson sums up de Botton's argument as being that religion is too serious to be confined to the General Synod, and describes this argument as attractive - although noting that the 'Education' chapter is the least convincing. Still, Wilson is glad for the optimism in the book. An early review by Kirkus suggests that De Botton's message is that religions take care of two important needs which secular society has not been able to - the need for community and the need for consolation in the face of life's problems. The reviewer describes De Botton's examples from religions as being 'cherry- pick[ed]', and states that De Botton's secular alternatives are less than persuasive, and 'insulting'. The reviewer notes that De Botton discounts the achievements of civic culture such as libraries, and regards it as a poorer work than De Botton's The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work and The Architecture of Happiness. Jeremy Biles considers De Botton's goal to be to keep philosophy in everyday life. Biles compares Religion for Atheists unfavorably to De Botton's The Consolations of Philosophy, saying that Religion for Atheists seems at times \\"willfully blind\\" to aspects of reality, describing the book as a \\"hopeful fantasy\\". Biles criticizes the generalizations in the book, and De Botton failing to address how \\"politics and power\\" keep the dogmatic parts of religion together with the parts of religion De Botton says should be emulated in a secular fashion. James DeRoche, writing for Library Journal, states that many of De Botton's benefits of religion may have escaped atheists' view before, although religious people might take \\"some of this[the book] for granted\\". It is described as a book that will promote discussion between atheists and religious people. The reviewer for the Journal of Ecumenical Studies recommends Faitheist: How an Atheist Found Common Ground with the Religious over Religion for Atheists, criticizing Religion for Atheists for not providing citations for its quotes, and describes the book as a \\"glib and finally unconvincing proposal\\".

This can occur, for example, when an allogeneic transplantation patient develops an immune reaction to donor antigens, or when the body responds inappropriately to self antigens implicated in autoimmune diseases.. It must provide absence of specific antibodies for exactly that antigenes. Research using animal models in transplantation and autoimmune diseases has led to early-phase human trials of tolerogenic therapy for autoimmune conditions like Type 1 Diabetes. Dendritic cells in tolerogenic therapy Tolerogenic therapies employ the inbuilt tolerance mechanisms of a class of immune cells called dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are divided into two main subsets: # Mature dendritic cells are immunogenic. Their physiological role is to bridge innate and adaptive immune responses by presenting antigens to T-lymphocytes. In the presence of an inflammatory environment, which usually accompanies infection or tissue ‘danger’ signals, dendritic cells are activated (mature) and present foreign antigens to the T cells, initiating an appropriate immune response. # Semi-mature dendritic cells are tolerogenic. Conditions including the absence of an inflammatory environment result in the incomplete maturation of dendritic cells. Their influence on T-lymphocytes follows a different mechanism which induces tolerance, rather than immunogenicity. Tolerogenic therapies are based on the principle that inducing the semi-mature phenotype in dendritic cells and then exposing them to the target antigen should allow antigen-specific induction of T-cell tolerance. Tolerogenic dendritic cells induce tolerance through several mechanisms. Once stimulated, the dendritic cells migrate to the draining lymph node and present antigens to T cells via interaction of MHC class II-antigen complexes on the dendritic cell with T cell receptors on the T cell. This can induce T cell clonal deletion, T cell anergy or the proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Collectively, these mechanisms produce tolerance to specific antigens, which should help to prevent autoimmunity, but could therefore also be used as a therapy to induce tolerance to specific antigens implicated in autoimmune disease, or donor antigens in transplant patients. Mechanisms of therapy Several methods of inducing tolerance based on this approach are currently being explored. Ex vivo tolerogenic dendritic cells can be induced through the addition of cytokines, pharmacological agents or genetic engineering techniques after their extraction from the patient. The DCs are then pulsed with the specific antigen to which tolerance is desired and these, now tolerogenic, cells can be injected back into the patient. Alternative methods include the direct injection of an inducing agent to induce semi-mature DCs in vivo. Animal models Studies have suggested a role for tolerogenic dendritic cells in the treatment of diseases like type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis. In animal models of Diabetes mellitus (NOD mice), GM-CSF induces resistance by increasing the frequency of regulatory T cells which can suppress T cell proliferation through their T-cell receptors. GM-CSF treated mice were found to have a semi-mature phenotype of dendritic cells which were inefficient at inducing antigen specific cytotoxic T cells compared to controls. In multiple sclerosis research, EAE mice were completely protected from symptoms when injected with dendritic cells matured with TNF-α and antigen specific peptide compared to controls. T regulatory cells of mice treated with TNF-α produced IL-10, a cytokine which is able to inhibit the Th1 response therefore protecting against the Th1 dependent autoimmune EAE. Mouse models of autoimmune thyroiditis showed that a semi-mature phenotype of dendritic cells is maintained after mouse thyroglobulin immunization in GM-CSF treated but not control mice. IL-10 produced by T regulatory cells was important in suppressing the mouse thyroglobulin specific T cell response and therefore protecting against Experimental autoimmune thyroiditis in mice. Phase I studies into the safety and efficacy of tolerogenic DC therapy in humans have demonstrated the appropriateness of the therapy for further research. Future research will consider the effectiveness of tolerogenic therapies in a number of planned clinical trials into autoimmune diseases.

In addition to being a member of the Hvidsten group Iversen was also a veterinarian. The group helped the British Special Operations Executive parachute weapons and supplies into Denmark for distribution to the resistance. In March 1944, the Gestapo made an \\"incredible number of arrests\\" including in the region of Randers, where a number of members of the Hvidsten group were arrested. The following month De frie Danske reported that several arrestees from Hvidsten had been transferred from Randers to Vestre Fængsel. On 29 June 1944, Iversen and seven other members of the Hvidsten group were executed in Ryvangen.  After his death  On 15 July 1944 De frie Danske reported on the execution of several members of the Hvidsten group. Six months later the January 1945 issue of the resistance newspaper Frit Danmark (Free Denmark) reported that on 29 June the previous year Iversen and seven other named members of the Hvidsten group had been executed.

He was a son of Ímar and a member of the Uí Ímair. Biography Sitriuc succeeded his brother Sichfrith as King of Dublin in 888.Downham p. 25 For most of Sitriuc's reign, and for the decade preceding it, Dublin was weakened by internal strife and dynastic feuds. Sichfrith had been a victim of these; he was killed by an unnamed kinsman of the Uí Ímair.Downham p. 25, Annals of Clonmacnoise s.a. 888, Annals of Ulster s.a. 888, Chronicon Scotorum s.a. 888 However, despite these problems the Dubliners fought successful wars against the forces of Leinster and the Southern Uí Néill. In 893 Sitriuc was challenged for the control of Dublin by one Jarl Sichfrith, with both claiming the title of king.Downham p. 25, Annals of Ulster s.a. 893 Sitriuc and Sichfrith left Dublin separately that year for military campaigns in Britain, and although Sitriuc returned a year later it is unknown which of the two, if either, retained the title of king. Sitriuc was killed by a number of other unnamed Vikings in 896.Annals of the Four Masters s.a. 896, Annals of Ulster s.a. 896 His death coincided with the death of two other prominent Vikings, Glúntradna son of Glúniarann and Amlaíb, grandson of Ímar, marking a serious drop in the political stability of the kingdom.Downham p. 26, Annals of Ulster s.a. 896, Annals of the Four Masters s.a. 896, Chronicon Scotorum s.a. 896 It has been speculated the aforementioned Glúniarann succeeded Sitriuc as king. Family Sitriuc was a son of Ímar and had at least two brothers, Bárid and Sichfrith, both of whom were Kings of Dublin before him.Downham pp. 24–28 Ímar is considered by some authorities to be identical to Ivar the Boneless, a Viking leader and a commander of the Great Heathen Army which invaded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England in 865. According to the Norse sagas he was one of the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, and his brothers included Björn Ironside, Halfdan Ragnarsson, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and Ubba.Holman p. 106 Ímar had at least five grandsons, Ragnall, Ímar, Sitric Cáech, Amlaíb, and Gofraid, but their parents are unidentified, so it is not possible to say which, if any, were the children of Sitriuc.Downham pp. 28–29 Notes References Citations Bibliography   Accessed via Internet Archive.

Santiago is a Democrat representing the 53rd Assembly District, which encompasses parts of Downtown Los Angeles and East Los Angeles. Santiago is a member of the California Latino Legislative Caucus. Prior to being elected to the Assembly in 2014, he was a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees. He also served as District Director to former Assembly Speaker John Pérez. Net Neutrality Bill Co-Authorship Santiago co-authored S.B. 822 alongside Senator Scott Wiener, legislation that would strengthen net neutrality protections in California. Hours after being signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, a Motion for Preliminary Injunction was filed by the Department of Justice. Both parties have agreed to wait until a separate court case in the D.C. Circuit Court is decided before moving on. As part of the agreement, the law is not currently being enforced and the injunction was withdrawn. After passing the California Senate, S.B. 822 was amended by Miguel Santiago in June 2018.https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/06/20/us/ap-us-net-neutrality- california.html SB-822 would restore Obama-era rules that the Republican- controlled Federal Communications Commission rolled back in December, 2017. Santiago's amendments removed all provisions of the bill's net neutrality protections that were not in the text of the 2015 Open Internet Order, leaving in only those that were in the two-pages of rules. This prompted the bill's original sponsor, Senator Scott Wiener, to pull his support for his own bill and declare that it had been \\"hijacked\\" and that he was \\"not interested in passing a bill that is watered down so severely.\\" The changes also included deleting a large section of definitions, which critics claim could make it more difficult for California's attorney general to prosecute violations of the legislation.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the- switch/wp/2018/06/20/californias-net-neutrality-legislation-just-got-watered- down-in-a-big-way/ The amendments, published less than 12 hours before the hearing, were approved 8-0[6] by the Communications and Conveyance committee, which Santiago chairs, on June 20, 2018. That vote occurred before Wiener could argue against them and before any testimony. After the testimony, the amended bill was approved 8-2. Opponents of the amended version stated that Santiago's changes would create loopholes through which broadband providers could charge fees to content providers while exempting their own content from any data caps. Proponents of the changes contend that without them broadband providers would not be allowed to offer free mobile data that doesn't count against users' caps, harming consumers, and that net neutrality in general would discourage providers from improving their network infrastructure. Representatives of major ISPs continue to oppose the bill, even in its amended form. State Assemblyman Miguel Santiago has received over $60,000 from telecom lobbyists, with AT&T; and Comcast being the top telecom contributors, over the course of his assembly career.https://votesmart.org/candidate/campaign- finance/151853/miguel-santiago#.WyhL_xJKhE4%5D However, Wiener said that despite the \\"strenuous disagreement here, [...] it’s not about campaign contributions\\" and that the telecoms \\"spent a lot of money in California targeting members with Twitter and Facebook ads, doing robo-calls to seniors telling them their bills are going to go up, that this bill is going to make your monthly payment go up. They flooded the capitol with lobbyists.\\" On June 6, 2018, Santiago released a press statement saying that his amendments were intended to help \\"deliver a bill that could withstand legal challenges from the telecommunications industry\\" and that \\"we ran out of time\\" to reach an agreement with Wiener. Knowing Wiener would not support the changes, the committee \\"took action to insert amendments without his consent to keep the bill moving.\\" Santiago expressed regret at the \\"legislative maneuverings\\" required to advance the bill and that he does not \\"envision policy being created in this manner.\\" The public response was intense, and Santiago stated that his family had received threats and that offensive memes smearing his wife and children had been shared online. 2014 California State Assembly  2016 California State Assembly  2018 California State Assembly  2020 California State Assembly  References  External links  * * Campaign website Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:California Democrats Category:Downtown Los Angeles Category:Politicians from Los Angeles Category:Living people Category:American politicians of Mexican descent Category:1973 births Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Miguel Santiago"},{"id":"44521501","text":"Seløyna or Seløy is an island in Øygarden municipality in Vestland county, Norway.

As seen from Etzel (mountain), Frauenwinkel protected area at Seedamm and the wooden lake bridge in the foreground, Zürichsee to the right, Obersee to the left. Lindenhof respectively Schlossberg vineyard and Bühler-Allee as seen from the harbour area towards Seedamm Lindenhof as seen from Kempraten on a photochrome of 1899 Lido and historic stable of the Deer park Lindenhof tophill area  Geography  Lindenhof hill (its eastern part is called Herrenberg) dominates the old city of Rapperswil, a locality of the municipality of Rapperswil-Jona in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland. Being a moraine remain of the last Glacial period in Switzerland, the area was created as a rocky conglomerate about 20,000 years ago. Its northwestern slope towards the bay of Kempraten on Zürichsee lakeshore is named Schlosshalde, and Schlosshügel, the opposite side of the longish hill, is dominated by the vineyard of that name and Rapperswil's 'official' rose garden towards the harbour area respectively Seedamm and Obersee lakeshore. In all, the around long and about wide hill, is surrounded on three sides by water, and rises about above lakeshore level; just the small eastern Herrenberg area is connected with the landside Altstadt und 19th-century extensions of the city of Rapperswil. Endingerhorn is the name of the western side of the longish mountain where the monastery is situated. In the south, just a few dozens meters away, at the landing gate of the Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) operate passenger vessels on the lake towards Zürich, and the nearby situated Rapperswil railway station is a nodal point of the Südostbahn (SOB) and S-Bahn Zürich railway operators.  Points of interest  Lindenhof (literally: Tilia court) is named after the Tilia trees planted there probably in the 13th century AD by the House of Rapperswil. As of today, it's a public square, a park respectively an arboretum and a playground, known for its remarkable view over both parts of the lake: Zürichsee, Lützelau and Ufnau island, and Zimmerberg–Albis–Felsenegg–Uetliberg and Pfannenstiel towards Zürich, as well as Obersee and Buechberg, Speer–Chüemettler–Federispitz mountains towards the Glarus Alps, and also the Seedamm area and the reconstruction of the lake bridge towards Hurden–Frauenwinkel–Etzel (mountain). Around the hill, there leads the so-called Bühler-Allee and some small pathways on lakeshore, where the Rapperswil lido (Seebad) is also located. At Schlosshügel the Deer park towards Kempratnerbucht is located, established in 1871; it houses usually between 10 and 20 Dama dama's. Endingen houses the early 17th-century Capuchine monastery, and the medieval fortifications. At the Schlossberg vineyard (first mentioned in 981 AD) and at the Einsiedlerhaus there are also the rose gardens situated. Hintergasse at the southernly base of the hill, is probably the oldest street in Rapperswil, and is flanked by medieval houses and estates, and further small private Rose gardens. Among other traditions, Eis-zwei-Geissebei is celebrated on Lindenhof, at the Rathaus and Castle when in the evening all regional Guggenmusik (carnival marching bands) gather to celebrate a roaring concert. The Rapperswil Castle, built in the early 13th century by Rudolf II and Rudolf II von Rapperswil, houses the Polenmuseum and the Poland memorial column. Inside the castle's palais, there is located the Schloss Restaurant having a rather expensive cuisine, but there's yet no tourist shop, kiosk or snack bar. Just a few meters easterly of the three- cornered castle, the about 800 years old Stadtpfarrkirche (parish church) and its cemetery chapel named Liebfrauenkapelle (built in 1489) are situated at the Herrenberg street, as well as the Stadtmuseum Rapperswil-Jona, a former small castle, and later part of the 15th-century northeasterly town wall towards Engelplatz. The latter is the former late medieval bastion and the eastern end of the Lindenhof hill and Rapperswil's historical core.

Renewal  In June 2012 the citizens of Rapperswil (Bürgerversammlung) voted to re-design the tophill Lindenhof area, but the proposal was too extensive, so a stripped-down variant was accepted in December, reducing the costs down from 1 million to 380,000 Swiss Francs. Some of the old trees had been cut down in winter 2010/2011 as they were fungal infestated; instead of two rows of trees there was one realized, and in addition, the rose bushes at the castle were preserved. Lindenhof remained an open area, and the slopes got shady promenades thanks to new plantings. The historic metal railing at the viewing platforms were retained and supplemented with fall protection as they no longer met the safety requirements; the project was managed by Hager & Partner. The Deer park also was remodeled, and the mammals got a rebuilt stable and more space for retreats.  Literature  * Peter Röllin: Kulturbaukasten Rapperswil-Jona: 36 Museen ohne Dach.

When Royce was elected to the U.S. House, she continued to work for him, putting in a total of 21 years as the congressman's community liaison and director of Asian affairs. During much of that time she also appeared regularly on her own television show, “LA Seoul with Young Kim,” and her own radio show, “Radio Seoul,” on which she discussed political issues affecting Korean Americans. =California Assembly= She was elected to the Assembly in 2014, defeating Democratic Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva.

Kim opposed a California law \\"requiring schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice and participate in sports by their gender identity rather than their anatomical gender.\\" She opposed the law over concerns that new school facilities could need to be constructed, additional spending could be required, students could change their identity \\"on a whim\\", and that male-to- female transgender students would have an unfair advantage in sports. She has said transgender individuals \\"deserve to be respected\\" but that she does not believe that LGBT individuals were born with their identities or orientations.

He taught at University of California, Riverside for 42 years and retired as executive vice chancellor. Sherman is known for his studies of malaria.  Early life  Sherman, the son of Russian immigrants Morris and Anna Sherman, graduated from James Monroe High School and enrolled in City College of New York (CCNY) with the goal of becoming a high school biology teacher. Influenced by his professors (James Dawson, William Tavolga, and Herman Spieth particularly) Sherman pursued a graduate degree at University of Florida under the tutelage of W.C. Allee. Sherman's studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the Army as a medical technician. After training at Fort Dix, Fort Sam Houston, and Valley Forge Army Hospital he was sent to overseas to work in army laboratories in Austria and Germany. Upon completion of his military service Sherman chose to teach high school in Yonkers rather than return to graduate school in Florida. While taking graduate courses through CCNY Sherman spent the summer of 1957 at Marine Biological Laboratory where he met his future wife, Vilia Gay Turner. In pursuit of his growing interest in protozoology, Sherman enrolled at Northwestern University to earn his doctorate.  Career  In 1962 Sherman was recruited by his former professor Herman Spieth to join the faculty of University of California, Riverside as an assistant professor. In 1966 Sherman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the field of molecular and cellular biology. He was promoted to associate professor in 1967 and full professor in 1970. For many years Sherman taught a basic course in parasitology for pre-med students. Sherman reports that while teaching science courses for non-majors, he gave lectures dressed in costume to impersonate famous scientists to increase student interest. By 1981 Sherman became the dean of the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences and would go on to serve as executive vice chancellor of UCR. After retiring from teaching in 2005 Sherman joined the Scripps Research Institute and at present is a Visiting Professor in the School of Medicine at the University of California at San Diego.  Publications  Sherman was the author of several books and more than a hundred academic papers. Sherman is most known for popular science books about microbiology with particular emphasis on malariology. In 2005 Sherman edited a textbook, Molecular approaches to malaria, noted for its inclusion of material following the 2002 complete genomic mapping of Plasmodium falciparum. Sherman's 2007 book Twelve Diseases that Changed Our World has been commented upon for its approachable style, having been written for novices and casual readers rather than academic audiences. Similarly, his 2009 The Elusive Malaria Vaccine has been reviewed as being engaging for the lay audience as it describes the history of malaria, particularly in the search for a vaccine. Described by one reviewer as \\"a story for all curious readers\\", Sherman's 2011 Magic Bullets to Conquer Malaria was criticized for a lack of either scientific or historical rigor although the book tells interesting stories of malariology.  * *  References  Category:University of California, Riverside faculty Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:1933 births Category:21st-century American biologists Category:Malariologists Category:Educators from New York City Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Living people Category:Scientists from New York (state) Category:James Monroe High School (New York City) alumni ","title":"Irwin Sherman"},{"id":"44521690","title":"Shawn Fonteno"},{"id":"44521692","text":"Gustave, baron de Romand, photographed by André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri Gustave du Bois, baron de Romand (1810—1871A Notice biographique sur M. le B[ar]on Gustave de Romand by Raincelin de Sergy appeared in 1853.) was a respected amateur French entomologist, a member of the Société entomologique de France. who was prominent in the political arena.

With the outbreak of World War II, he was granted an emergency commission on 20 September 1939 as a second lieutenant in the North Irish Horse, Royal Armoured Corps. In October 1939, he was granted the acting rank of captain. In December 1939, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and appointed the officer commanding A Squadron. He was killed in action in Italy on 24 October 1944, aged 37, and is buried in the Coriano Ridge War Cemetery near Riccione. Peerage His father, Arthur O'Neill, and grandfather, Edward O'Neill, 2nd Baron O'Neill, were Members of Parliament representing Mid Antrim and Antrim respectively in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. As the 2nd Baron O'Neill's eldest surviving son, Shane's father was heir to the title of Baron O'Neill. At his birth, Shane became second in line to the title of Baron O'Neill. However, his father died in action during World War I and he therefore became his grandfather's heir. He succeeded to the title after his grandfather's death in 1928, becoming the 3rd Baron O'Neill. As a hereditary peer with a Peerage of the United Kingdom, he was able to sit in the House of Lords. Though he had inherited the title in 1928, he first took his seat in the Lords on 3 April 1930. In 1937 he attended the Coronation of George VI at Westminster Abbey and paid homage to him with the other Lords Temporal.

This is normally greater where the railway or road is curved; raising the outer rail or the outer edge of the road creates a banked turn, thus allowing vehicles to maneuver through the curve at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible if the surface is flat or level.  Rail  Nuremberg–Ingolstadt line Track lubrication on a reverse curve in an area prone to movement due to wet beds On railways, cant helps a train steer around a curve, keeping the wheel flanges from touching the rails, minimizing friction and wear. The main functions of cant are the following: * Improve distribution of the load across both rails * Reduce wear on rails and wheels * Neutralize the effect of lateral forces * Improve passenger comfort Railway superelevation at work The necessary cant in a curve depends on the expected speed of the trains and the radius. However, it may be necessary to select a compromise value at design time, for example if slow-moving trains may occasionally use tracks intended for high-speed trains. Generally the aim is for trains to run without flange contact, which also depends on the tire profile of the wheels. Allowance has to be made for the different speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make flange contact with the inner rail on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment. Many high-speed lines do not permit slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads. In some cases, the impact is reduced by the use of flange lubrication. Ideally, the track should have sleepers (railroad ties) at a closer spacing and a greater depth of ballast to accommodate the increased forces exerted in the curve. At the ends of a curve, the amount of cant cannot change from zero to its maximum immediately. It must change (ramp) gradually in a track transition curve. The length of the transition depends on the maximum allowable speed; the higher the speed, the greater length is required. For the United States, with a standard maximum unbalanced superelevation of , the formula is this: :v_{max}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{E_a + 3}{0.00066d}} where E_a is the superelevation in inches, d is the curvature of the track in degrees per 100 feet, and v_{max} the maximum speed in MPH. The maximum value of cant (the height of the outer rail above the inner rail) for a standard gauge railway is approximately . For high-speed railways in Europe, maximum cant is when slow freight trains are not allowed.2002/732/EC. *, Commission Decision of May 30, 2002 concerning the Technical Specification for Interoperability Track unbalanced superelevation (cant deficiency) in the United States is restricted to , though is permissible by waiver. The maximum value for European railways varies by country, some of which have curves with over of unbalanced superelevation to permit high-speed transportation. The highest values are only for tilting trains, because it would be too uncomfortable for passengers in conventional train cars. = Physics of track cant = Ideally, the amount of cant E_a, given the speed v of a train, the radius of curvature r and the gauge w of the track, the relation :v^2 = \\\\frac{E_a rg}{\\\\sqrt{w^2 - E_a^2}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{E_a rg}{w} must be fulfilled, with g the gravitational acceleration. This follows simply from a balance between weight, centrifugal force, and normal force. In the approximation it is assumed that the cant is small compared to the gauge of the track. It is often convenient to define the unbalanced cant E_u as the maximum allowed additional amount of cant that would be required by a train moving faster than the speed for which the cant was designed, setting the maximum allowed speed v_{max}. In a formula this becomes :v_{max}\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(E_a + E_u)rg}{w}}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(E_a + E_u)g}{dw}} with d=1/r the curvature of the track, which is also the turn in radians per unit length of track. In the United States, maximum speed is subject to specific rules. When filling in g=32.17\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ft/s^2}, w=56.5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{in} and the conversion factors for US customary units, the maximum speed of a train on curved track for a given cant deficiency or unbalanced superelevation is determined by the following formula: :v_{max}\\\\approx\\\\frac{3600}{63360}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{32.17\\\\cdot 12(E_a + E_u)}{56.5\\\\cdot d\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{1200\\\\cdot180}}} \\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{E_a + E_u}{0.00066 d}} with E_a and E_u in inches, d the degree of curvature in degrees per 100 feet and v_{max} in MPH. = Examples = In Australia, the Australian Rail Track Corporation is increasing speed around curves sharper than an radius by replacing wooden sleepers with concrete ones so that the cant can be increased. = Rail cant = The rails themselves are now usually canted inwards by about 5 to 10 percent. In 1925 about 15 of 36 major American railways had adopted this practice.  Roads  Steeper cants or cambers are common on residential streets, allowing water to drain into the gutter In civil engineering, cant is often referred to as cross slope or camber. It helps rainwater drain from the road surface. Along straight or gently curved sections, the middle of the road is normally higher than the edges. This is called \\"normal crown\\" and helps shed rainwater off the sides of the road. During road works that involve lengths of temporary carriageway, the slope may be the opposite to normal – for example, with the outer edge higher – which causes vehicles to lean towards oncoming traffic. In the UK, this is indicated on warning signs as \\"adverse camber\\". On more severe bends, the outside edge of the curve is raised, or superelevated, to help vehicles around the curve. The amount of superelevation increases with its design speed and with curve sharpness. =Off-camber= An off-camber corner is described as the opposite of a banked turn, or a negative-bank turn, which is lower on the outside of a turn than on the inside. Off-camber corners are both feared and celebrated by skilled drivers. Handling them is a major factor in skilled vehicle control, both single-track and automotive; both engine-powered and human-powered vehicles; both on and off closed courses; and both on and off paved surfaces. On race courses, they are one of a handful of engineering factors at the disposal of a course designer in order to challenge and test drivers' skills. Off-camber corners were described by a training guide for prospective racers as \\"the hardest corners you will encounter\\" on the track. Many notable courses such as Riverside International Raceway combine off-camber corners with elevation and link corners for extra driver challenge. On the street, they are a feature of some of the world's most celebrated paved roads, such as The \\"Dragon\\" (US 129) through Deals Gap and the \\"Diamondback\\" (NC 226A) in North Carolina, Route 78 in Ohio, Route 125 in Pennsylvania, Route 33 in California, and Betws-y-Coed Triangle at Snowdonia National Park in Wales. To mountain bikers and motorcyclists on trails and dirt tracks, off-camber corners are also challenging, and can be either an engineered course feature, or a natural feature of single-track trails. In cyclocross, off-camber sections are very common as the courses snake around ridges, adding difficulty. Camber in virtual race circuits is carefully controlled by video game race simulators to achieve the designer's desired level of difficulty.

At the same time women were granted the right to stand for election to Parliament, the first place in the world. Social Purity Society Social Purity Society The Women's Suffrage League evolved from the Social Purity Society, an organisation that was concerned about the social and economic difficulties many women faced. The Society campaigned for fairer treatment of women by the law, and greater legal protection for young women. Thanks to the Society the age of consent for girls was raised to 16 and the age of young people in brothels was regulated. Members of the Society and similar movements of the period, notably temperance advocates including the W.C.T.U., realised that the key to affecting social change was parliamentary representation. This led the establishment of the Women's Suffrage League of South Australia with the view of initiating a movement for the enfranchisement of women.

It was built from 1888 to . It is also known as Gloralgar Flats and Milton Terrace. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building was constructed as a two-storeyed brick row of six houses in 1888-9 by Brisbane builder Joseph Blain Cook. In September 1888 Cook had acquired from squatter John Frederick McDougall the title to subdivisions 1 to 6 of the Milton House estate, a section of prime real estate along the Milton Reach of the Brisbane River. He raised a mortgage of on the property to finance construction of the terrace. The first house was erected in late 1888, and the remainder of the row was completed in 1889. The architect is unknown. The terrace was built as a rental property, the Queensland Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act of 1885 prohibiting the granting of titles to individual terrace houses. The enterprise reflected the economic optimism of the late 1880s, but within two years of construction Cook was declared insolvent and the terrace passed to his mortgagees. By 1895 the row was known as Milton Terrace, and with its river views and breezes and proximity to the centre of town, it remained one of Brisbane's more prestigious rental addresses until well into the twentieth century, attracting mainly professional and white- collar tenants. The house adjacent to Park Road was occupied by the Rourke family from about 1895 to 1905. They owned the terrace at that period and it is likely they were responsible for adding a southwestern verandah and dome room. By 1920 each house had been subdivided into at least two flats, and builder Simon Smith, who acquired the property in 1923, may have been responsible for removing the front parapet and installing dormer windows. By 1928 a tennis court had been established in the southwestern yard. This is no longer extant. In the thirties the name Milton Terrace was lost, and by the end of the decade the houses were known collectively as Gloralgar Flats. During the Second World War the flats are believed to have been rented by army authorities for officer accommodation. In the postwar period the verandahs were enclosed and the six houses were converted into twenty-seven flats, which were considered something of a bohemian retreat. Despite its decline, the building remained a visual landmark along Coronation Drive, and in 1984 it was refurbished and recycled as offices and a restaurant.  Description  Cook Terrace, 1945 Cook Terrace consists of six two-storeyed rendered brick houses, each with an attic and sub-floor. The attics are contained within a corrugated iron mansard roof, which is divided by continuations of the party walls, which also separate the front and back verandahs. Each attic is lit by a single dormer at the rear and a pair at the front. The latter appear to have been added at a later date, and a high front parapet of repeating circles, which partly obscured the roof, probably was removed at the same time. Each house also has two double chimneys rising above the western dividing walls. The front elevation is unified by supporting timber posts and capitals with cast- iron valances, brackets and balustrading, much of which has been replaced but not to the original pattern, along ground and first floors. The first floor verandahs are roofed with convex iron and overhang slightly those of the ground floor, and were glazed in 1984. A rendered front wall and stepped approaches separate the terrace from the street pavement. Each house is constructed to an identical floor plan. On the ground floor an entrance to the side leads to the hallway from which two rooms open - originally drawing and dining rooms. These are divided by folding cedar doors, with a bay window which overlooks the river from the front room. At the far end of the hallway a cedar staircase leads to the first floor and attic. On the first floor a broad arch separates the two main rooms, which were intended probably as bedroom and sitting room. Two sets of French doors open onto the front verandah from the main room and a smaller adjacent room, which likely was the dressing room, to its right. The rear room is lit by a triple window. The attic also is divided into a front and back room, but the partitioning is plasterboard and no evidence of any original division is visible. Interior finishes to each house include cedar joinery, plastered walls, marble fireplace surrounds in the ground floor rooms and tessellated entrance tiles. Air-conditioning, sound- proofing, electronic security systems and signage, were introduced during the 1980s renovation. Each house has a detached timber two-storeyed service wing, accessed from the rear verandah. Externally they remain substantially intact, but have been gutted. Glazed terracotta paving tiles, bearing the name \\"J Petrie\\" (most likely a reference to John Petrie) on the reverse, line the courtyards between the kitchen houses. Around the turn of the century the western house was remodelled to include: a verandah extension with decorative timber elements of the Federation period along the side wall; a \\"dome room\\" rear addition which features a high coffered ceiling with arched timber ribs, tongue-and-groove lining boards, chair rail, and fireplace with its original picture tiles; and pressed metal ceilings and ornamental pillars with capitals in the archway of the two ground floor rooms. Cook Terrace is situated on one of the busiest arterial roads linking the western suburbs with the centre of the city. However, the river view remains undisturbed, and the mature fig tree in the grounds at the corner of Park Road and Coronation Drive contributes to the nineteenth century ambience.  Heritage listing  Cook Terrace was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Completed in 1889, Cook Terrace provides evidence of the 1880s boom era confidence in Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Cook Terrace is substantially intact, including attached timber service wings which are rare, and survives as one of few nineteenth century terraces in Brisbane. The continuation of the masonry party walls above the roof line, is an uncommon type of construction in attached row housing in Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Cook Terrace is substantially intact, including attached timber service wings which are rare, and survives as one of few nineteenth century terraces in Brisbane. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Cook Terrace is prominently located fronting Coronation Drive, and contributes to the Coronation Drive riverscape and streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cook Terrace is a local landmark and has a strong association for the people of Brisbane with Milton history, both 19th century and more recent 20th century, particularly when Cook Terrace was converted to flats and attracted a student clientele in the 1960s and 1970s.

It was situated just west of downtown, near Third Street and Vermont Avenue. Bimini Baths contained a natatorium, swimming pools, swimming plunge, Turkish baths, a medical treatment department, and bottling works. History In the 19th century, the area was a marsh with natural hot springs. The waters were discovered during oil drilling exploration. They were discovered by a man who was boring for oil at a depth of under of solid white marble. Named after the Bahamian island of Bimini, the venue was owned and operated by Dr. David W. Edwards, president and treasurer of the Bimini Water Company; and David W. Edwards, Jr. served as vice president and secretary. The company was founded December 31, 1902. In 1903, the bath house opened. In the following year, Bimini Hotel was built across the street, and the spring waters were pumped to it. In 1917, J. J. Warrick was manager of the baths and sanitarium. An outdoor pool was added to the baths in 1921. Mexicans were only allowed into the Bimini Baths \\"when it was too dirty for whites to swim in\\" it. Besides the baths, the Bimini Water Company delivered plain and carbonated water to Los Angeles residents. The company provided the water prior to 1915 when the city mains installation occurred. The business went bankrupt in 1951 and the buildings were demolished in 1956. In the present day, the springs area has become Bimini Slough Ecology Park, featuring native plant stands and a creekbed. The hotel has become headquarters for the Mary Lind Foundation. Hot springs The well was reported to yield 100 gallons a minute of water at a temperature of 104 °F. The primary alkalinity of the water gave it a peculiar soft feeling that led to the nickname, \\"the velvet baths.\\" The well was drilled deep in Tertiary age sediments that make up the oil formation in this locale. Containing no sulphur, it carries a large quantity of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride, with some potassium chloride, magnesium carbonate, iron, alumina, and free carbonic acid. Architecture and fittings The large wooden building contained a 50-yard main pool, a separate pool for women, and other private pools. In addition, the venue had a cafe, pool observation balcony, and 500 dressing rooms. The original building was destroyed in 1905 during a fire. It was rebuilt in 1906 in Mission revival style by a design of Thornton Fitzhugh. The new construction featured a Turkish Bath, additional pools, and rooftop gardens. The bathing resort also featured a sanitarium. Tub baths and three large swimming plunges were available for the public. A sanitarium hotel nearby was under the same management.

Maier, Plasmonics, Fundamentals and Applications (Springer, New York, 2007). where electrons oscillate at the surface of a metal due to strong resonant interactions with the electric field of incident light. Due to the high scattering rate of electrons, ohmic losses in plasmonic signals are generally large, which limits the signal transfer distances to the sub-centimeter range, unless hybrid optoplasmonic light guiding networks, or plasmon gain amplification are used. Both surface plasmon polaritons propagating along the metal-dielectric interfaces and localized surface plasmon modes supported by metal nanoparticles are characterized by large momentum values, which enable strong resonant enhancement of the local density of photon states,S.V. Boriskina, H. Ghasemi, and G. Chen, Materials Today, vol. 16, pp. 379-390, 2013 and can be utilized to enhance weak optical effects of opto-electronic devices. Current Issues One of the biggest issues in making plasmonic circuits a feasible reality is the impractically short propagation length of surface plasmons. Typically, surface plasmons travel distances only on the scale of millimeters before damping diminishes the signal.Brongersma, Mark. \\"Are Plasmonics Circuitry Wave of Future?\\" Stanford School of Engineering. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2014. . This is largely due to the unique dispersion relation of surface plasmons, which shows that as confinement increases, resistive damping increases; thus, propagation length decreases. Researchers are attempting to reduce losses in surface plasmon propagation by examining a variety of materials and their respective properties. New promising low-loss plasmonic materials include metal oxides and nitrides as well as graphene. Another foreseeable barrier plasmonic circuits will have to overcome is heat; heat in a plasmonic circuit may or may not exceed the heat generated by complex electronic circuits. It has recently been proposed to reduce heating in plasmonic networks by designing them to support trapped optical vortices, which circulate light powerflow through the inter-particle gaps thus reducing absorption and Ohmic heating, S.V. Boriskina \\"Plasmonics with a twist: taming optical tornadoes on the nanoscale,\\" chapter 12 in: Plasmonics: Theory and applications (T.V. Shahbazyan and M.I. Stockman Eds.) Springer 2013 In addition to heat, it is also difficult to change the direction of a plasmonic signal in a circuit without significantly reducing its amplitude and propagation length. One clever solution to the issue of bending the direction of propagation is the use of Bragg mirrors to angle the signal in a particular direction, or even to function as splitters of the signal. Finally, emerging applications of plasmonics for thermal emission manipulation and heat-assisted magnetic recording leverage Ohmic losses in metals to obtain devices with new enhanced functionalities. Waveguiding Optimal plasmonic waveguide designs strive to maximize both the confinement and propagation length of surface plasmons within a plasmonic circuit. Surface plasmon polaritons are characterized by a complex wave vector, with components parallel and perpendicular to the metal-dielectric interface. The imaginary part of the wave vector component is inversely proportional to the SPP propagation length, while its real part defines the SPP confinement. The SPP dispersion characteristics depend on the dielectric constants of the materials comprising the waveguide. The propagation length and confinement of the surface plasmon polariton wave are inversely related. Therefore, stronger confinement of the mode typically results in shorter propagation lengths. The construction of a practical and usable surface plasmon circuit is heavily dependent on a compromise between propagation and confinement. Maximizing both confinement and propagation length helps mitigate the drawbacks of choosing propagation length over confinement and vice versa. Multiple types of waveguides have been created in pursuit of a plasmonic circuit with strong confinement and sufficient propagation length. Some of the most common types include insulator-metal-insulator (IMI), metal-insulator-metal (MIM), dielectric loaded surface plasmon polariton (DLSPP), gap plasmon polariton (GPP), channel plasmon polariton (CPP), wedge surface plasmon polariton (wedge), and hybrid opto-plasmonic waveguides and networks. Dissipation losses accompanying SPP propagation in metals can be mitigated by gain amplification or by combining them into hybrid networks with photonic elements such as fibers and coupled-resonator waveguides. This design can result in the previously mentioned hybrid plasmonic waveguide, which exhibits subwavelength mode on a scale of one-tenth of the diffraction limit of light, along with an acceptable propagation length.M. Z. Alam, J. Meier, J. S. Aitchison, and M. Mojahedi, \\"Super mode propagation in low index medium\\", Paper ID: JThD112, CLEO/QELS 2007. Coupling The input and output ports of a plasmonic circuit will receive and send optical signals, respectively. To do this, coupling and decoupling of the optical signal to the surface plasmon is necessary. The dispersion relation for the surface plasmon lies entirely below the dispersion relation for light, which means that for coupling to occur additional momentum should be provided by the input coupler to achieve the momentum conservation between incoming light and surface plasmon polariton waves launched in the plasmonic circuit. There are several solutions to this, including using dielectric prisms, gratings, or localized scattering elements on the surface of the metal to help induce coupling by matching the momenta of the incident light and the surface plasmons. After a surface plasmon has been created and sent to a destination, it can then be converted into an electrical signal. This can be achieved by using a photodetector in the metal plane, or decoupling the surface plasmon into freely propagating light that can then be converted into an electrical signal. Alternatively, the signal can be out- coupled into a propagating mode of an optical fiber or waveguide. Active Devices The progress made in surface plasmons over the last 50 years has led to the development in various types of devices, both active and passive. A few of the most prominent areas of active devices are optical, thermo-optical, and electro-optical. All-optical devices have shown the capacity to become a viable source for information processing, communication, and data storage when used as a modulator. In one instance, the interaction of two light beams of different wavelengths was demonstrated by converting them into co-propagating surface plasmons via cadmium selenide quantum dots. Electro-optical devices have combined aspects of both optical and electrical devices in the form of a modulator as well. Specifically, electro-optic modulators have been designed using evanescently coupled resonant metal gratings and nanowires that rely on long-range surface plasmons (LRSP). Likewise, thermo-optic devices, which contain a dielectric material whose refractive index changes with variation in temperature, have also been used as interferometric modulators of SPP signals in addition to directional-coupler switches. Some thermo-optic devices have been shown to utilize LRSP waveguiding along gold stripes that are embedded in a polymer and heated by electrical signals as a means for modulation and directional-coupler switches. Another potential field lies in the use of spasers in areas such as nanoscale lithography, probing, and microscopy. Passive Devices Although active components play an important role in the use of plasmonic circuitry, passive circuits are just as integral and, surprisingly, not trivial to make. Many passive elements such as prisms, lenses, and beam splitters can be implemented in a plasmonic circuit, however fabrication at the nano scale has proven difficult and has adverse effects. Significant losses can occur due to decoupling in situations where a refractive element with a different refractive index is used. However, some steps have been taken to minimize losses and maximize compactness of the photonic components. One such step relies on the use of Bragg reflectors, or mirrors composed of a succession of planes to steer a surface plasmon beam. When optimized, Bragg reflectors can reflect nearly 100% of the incoming power. Another method used to create compact photonic components relies on CPP waveguides as they have displayed strong confinement with acceptable losses less than 3 dB within telecommunication wavelengths. Maximizing loss and compactness with regards to the use of passive devices, as well as active devices, creates more potential for the use of plasmonic circuits.

Medical indemnity is a form of professional indemnity coverage defined by Australian legislation – the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 and is a type of general insurance (see Insurance in Australia). In the UK, this type of professional indemnity for healthcare practitioners is generally referred to as ‘professional indemnity’ and in the USA, ‘medical negligence insurance’. In Australia, the term ‘medical indemnity’ can be used to refer to all healthcare indemnity (e.g. dental, allied health, medical), not just that provided for medical doctors. However, there are only six Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority (AHPRA) listed insurers that provide medical indemnity insurance cover to medical practitioners.Medical Board of Australia, Approved List of Insurers, http://www.medicalboard.gov.au/Registration-Standards.aspx Australian medical practitioner medical indemnity providers include: * Avant * Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company (distributed by Tego Insurance) * Guild Insurance Limited (oral and maxillofacial surgeons only) * MDA National Limited (MDAN) * Medical Indemnity Protection Society (MIPS) * Medical Insurance Australia Group (MIGA) Industry bodies include the Insurance Council of Australia and the Medical Indemnity Industry Association of Australia.  Background of medical indemnity in Australia  Following the UK model from the late nineteenth century, Australian doctors have protected themselves through establishing state-based mutual organizations collectively called Medical Defense Organizations (MDOs). These medical defense organizations traditionally provided discretionary coverage, rather than coverage under a contract of insurance. On 31 May 2002, the Australian Government announced a strategy to improve transparency in the medical indemnity industry, make medical indemnity a viable commercial product and bring medical defense organizations (MDOs) away from discretionary coverage and into the fold of all insurance under the prudential framework. This strategy was brought about because of the medical indemnity crisis of 2002.Parliament of Australia (2002), Explanatory memorandum, Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill_em/misapsb638/memo1.html  Medical indemnity crisis of 2002  In April 2002, Australia's largest medical indemnity insurer, UMP, entered voluntary administration with unfunded group liabilities of $455 million.Ruth pollard, Sydney Morning Herald, UMP comes out of its 18-month coma, November 11, 2003 The Australian Government responded by providing an initial capital guarantee of $35 million until 30 June 2002, but by November 2003 this had become a comprehensive support package.Loane Skene, Paul Nisselle, The medical indemnity crisis: a lawyer’s perspective, Medicine Today, 2002 3(6): 77-80, Article Extract = Background to the crisis = MDO's traditionally offered occurrence-based discretionary coverage. That meant that at the discretion of the Board, a member would be granted assistance for claims arising from incidents that occurred while they were a member. This type of coverage is the protection of choice for the majority of UK health practitioners. Most MDOs did not fully fund the projected ‘incurred but not yet reported’ (IBNR) claims liabilities that are consequent upon providing occurrence-based coverage. The often fierce competition between MDOs and commercial insurers also inhibited the drive for appropriate IBNR funding. As a consequence of changes in accounting standards, some indemnity providers were found to be at risk of not being able to meet future liabilities.The Treasury, Australian Government, Review of the competitive neutrality in the medical indemnity insurance industry Report – March 2005, ‘Introduction’, http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/965/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=02_intro.asp In the years leading up to the crisis, there was a significant increase in all types of liability claims including medical indemnity claims.

The justification for the bail-out package was that UMP was too important rather than too large – notably, the Australian Government did not bail out HIH which collapsed at a similar time but was a much larger enterprise.Benton E.

Importantly all medical indemnity coverage now had to be provided as insurance; only by Australian authorized insurers; and the cover offered changed from claims-incurred to claims-made insurance. This provided a better way for insurers to estimate liabilities, hence, stabilize the industry.  Medical indemnity today  Medical Indemnity in Australia stabilized following the introduction of the Federal Government initiatives Tort reforms and better than predicted run-off of IBNR claims liabilities. In a report from the Australian Government just three years after UMP received a bailout package from the Government, the industry was described as healthy: “In March 2005, it is clear that the total of all the initiatives introduced by both state and federal governments, the oversight of the regulators, APRA and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and, most importantly, by the medical indemnity industry itself, has brought the industry back to a state of health surprisingly quickly. All the insurers have reached — or are well on the way to reaching — the capital APRA requires. Tort law reform seems to have had a significant effect in reining in the previous trends to ever-escalating claims. There is a strong spirit of both cooperation and healthy competition in the industry”.The Treasury, Australian Government, Review of the competitive neutrality in the medical indemnity insurance industry Report – March 2005, ‘Current stat of the Medical Indemnity Industry’, http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/965/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=03_state.asp References Category:Healthcare in Australia ","title":"Medical indemnity in Australia"},{"id":"44522347","text":"Mat Snow (born 20 October 1958) is an English music journalist, magazine editor, and author.

It was built from . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Milton House was erected in 1852 or 1853 for retired Queen Street chemist Ambrose Eldridge. It was the first substantial house in the area and soon a local landmark, being prominent in early views of Brisbane. It was the base for Eldridge's experimental farming when the Moreton Bay region was struggling to establish itself, and later for John Frederick McDougall's considerable pastoral holdings in the area. Ambrose Eldridge was a Sydney chemist who arrived in Moreton Bay in late July 1847 to work in John Taggart's Medical Hall, a chemist shop in Queen Street. Taggart sold the business to Eldridge, who took over from 1 October 1849, and developed the business as a chemist, druggist, oilman, and grocer. In the late 1840s and 1850s, Eldridge adopted an active and enthusiastic role in the development of Brisbane and Queensland. He was prominent in the Separation movement and served on a wide variety of local committees (for most of which he was a founding member), including those of the Hospital, the proposed Brisbane Market (1851), the Moreton Bay Steam Navigation Company, the Moreton Bay Horticultural Society, the Brisbane Exchange, the Northern Districts Agricultural and Pastoral Association, the Moreton Bay Immigration and Land Company (first chairman of directors in 1855-56), and the Moreton Bay Building Society, which was dissolved in 1854 to re-emerge as the Moreton Bay Permanent Investment and Building Society in 1855. He was active in promoting local issues such as a bridge over Breakfast Creek, a committee to communicate between the electors of Moreton Bay and their representative in the New South Wales Legislative Council in Sydney, a survey of the Brisbane River entrance and bar, direct emigration to Moreton Bay, government funding to churches, and regularly subscribed to rewards for the discovery of gold in the Moreton and Darling Downs districts. He was a prominent member of St John's Anglican Church, and an active participant in the Brisbane School of Arts and Sciences and the Moreton Bay Musical Society. During the early 1850s his business flourished and he acquired a number of Brisbane town and suburban allotments. Eldridge was a well-respected townsman with a clear commitment to the development of Brisbane at political, civic, economic and social levels, but he was also something of a visionary. Like the indomitable Dr John Dunmore Lang, who envisioned a Moreton Bay populated by yeomen farmers, Eldridge was determined to prove that agriculture in the Northern Districts of New South Wales was economically viable. In the second half of 1851, Eldridge, who had little knowledge of farming, purchased Western Suburban Allotments 4 to 11, totalling over , along the northern bank of the Brisbane River, just beyond the town boundary. Here, at what he named Milton Farm, Eldridge experimented with cotton growing, hoping to prove that agriculture at Moreton Bay could be sustained and profitable. Whilst not the only Moreton Bay resident to experiment with cotton-growing at the time, he was initially one of the most successful. Cotton was a logical crop with which to experiment – it was one of the principal import of Great Britain, and an important basis of her manufacturing industry, and if grown successfully at Moreton Bay, would ensure the prosperity of the Northern Districts of New South Wales, and enhance local aspirations for Separation. By September 1852, five acres of the Milton land had been cleared, and were planted the following month with seeds of the finest Sea Island Cotton. At the close of 1852, Eldridge retired from business, selling the Medical Hall and devoting his time to the Milton experiment. It is likely that Milton House was erected about this time. By June 1853 the first crop of Milton cotton was being picked, yielding at least 20 bales. Eldridge reported in the local press that, not including the cost of land and land clearing, he had expended in the experiment, and had made a profit of . That December he was awarded first prize of by the New South Wales Government, for samples of the cotton sent to Sydney in a government-sponsored competition. Two years later he sent samples of the Milton cotton to the Paris Exhibition of 1855, where it was highly acclaimed. In 1853, Eldridge expanded his efforts to promote profitable local farming, taking up on long lease approximately at Eagle Farm. By late 1854 this land had been cleared, and in March 1855, Eldridge announced his intention of removing to Eagle Farm, and selling the Milton Estate. The Eldridges resided at Milton through the remainder of 1855, but the property, including a mansion house was sold and transferred to pastoralist John Frederick McDougall in January 1856, for . For Eldridge, the move spelt disaster. The experiments at Eagle Farm appear to have failed, and by 1859 he had returned to the chemist business, opening a shop at Ipswich. He died in 1860, leaving his family penniless. Manning family on the steps of Milton House, 1868 John Frederick McDougall, a member of the first Queensland Legislative Council, farmed the Milton Estate, adding large western suburbs leaseholds to his holding, and enlarging the house considerably. From 1864 the McDougalls resided at Rosalie Station and let Milton. Tenants included Arthur Manning, the Colonial Under-Secretary; Henry Walsh, MLC and speaker of the Legislative Assembly; and James Crombie. The house gave its name to the local suburb, while neighbouring Rosalie took its name from McDougall's Darling Downs property, bearing testament to the one time extent of his holdings in the western suburbs. Milton Farm was sold to the Queensland Investment and Land Mortgage Co. Ltd in 1885 and subdivided for residential development, at which time the newly created streets of McDougall, Manning, Walsh and Crombie were named after previous owners or occupiers of Milton House. The Commissioner of Police, David Thompson Seymour, bought an area of nearly two acres, including the house, in 1887, but sold it the next year to Dr Hugh Bell, a noted physician and consultant at the Brisbane General Hospital for forty years. In 1904 the property was purchased by grain merchant William Siemon and his family, who renovated the premises in 1922. In 1955 the Siemon family gave the property to the Presbyterian Church, which used Milton House as a hostel for women college students until 1983. The building subsequently became part of the Kings Row Corporate Park development, at which time it was refurbished to resemble its outward appearance of the 1860s.  Description  The hip-roofed house is Colonial Georgian in style and plan, having a typical front doorway with segmented sidelights and an arched fanlight, and a symmetrical arrangement of rooms about a central hallway on each floor. The ground floor has wide, open verandahs on three sides. Two service rooms run across the rear of the core, incorporating pavilion wings of the side verandahs. The walls are of brick, which is lime rendered and jointed to give the impression of stone. A three-roomed cellar is constructed of rough rubble walling, and entered by steps on the south side of the verandah. The roof shingles have been replaced with corrugated iron. Internally, the narrow cedar staircase has shaped handrails and stick-balusters (replacements), the vestibule features an ornate plaster ceiling, and the dining room has an early 20th century pressed metal ceiling. The first floor, with narrow stick- balustraded verandahs on three sides, originally accommodated bedrooms. These verandahs are accessed by French doors, though the louvred shutters have not been reinstated. Fireplaces remain in the ground floor rooms but have been enclosed upstairs. They lead to dominant chimney-stacks which are set diagonally to the ridge of the wide hipped roof. Milton House was originally built as a homestead, high on the riverbank overlooking the surrounding property. Photographs taken in the 1860s show a line of palms between two Norfolk Island pines and a pathway edged with shrubbery leading down towards the river. All of these plantings seem to have disappeared by the 1950s. The present garden and lawns to the front and sides of the house were planted at the time of the building's refurbishment but include mature poinciana and jacaranda trees. The rear of the house opens onto a newly built tennis court, swimming pool and outdoor entertaining area. The river facade can be glimpsed from Coronation Drive, framed by modern office blocks.  Heritage listing  Milton House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Milton House is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, being associated with important early agricultural experimentation in pre-separation Queensland, associated with the pastoral development of the western suburbs prior to closer settlement in the 1860s and as one of the oldest surviving houses in Brisbane and the first substantial house in the western suburbs. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Milton House demonstrates rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage, being one of the few surviving pre-Separation houses in Brisbane, numbered with Newstead House, Bulimba House and Shafston House and as a rare example of 1850s Colonial Georgian architecture in Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Milton House survives sufficiently in form, feature and material, to be important in demonstrating the principal features of Colonial Georgian architecture adapted to local climatic conditions, notably through the inclusion of verandahs and French doors on three sides. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Milton House has a special association with the local community with the house giving its name to the local suburb, with the neighbouring suburb of Rosalie perpetuating the association with the second owner of Milton House, JF McDougall and as an early local landmark, still visible from the arterial river road to the western suburbs.

Started in Summer 1963, it soon attracted the attention of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. By December 1963, he was calling for its expansion. Operation Hardnose expanded and continued to report on the Ho Chi Minh trail even as American military intelligence activities mounted against the communist supply artery. In an attempt to adapt technology for use by illiterate Lao Theung, some of the U.S. Air Force's survival radios were modified by the CIA for use by their spies. By 1968, Operation Hardnose was being marginalized by use of other intelligence systems, such as air- and ground-based electronic sensors. Also, with the advent of the AC-130 Spectre gunship, which both generated its own targets as well as struck them, there was little use for Hardnose spotting enemy vehicles. Hardnose faded into insignificance after that.  Background  The Kingdom of Laos moved toward independence from the French following World War II. Having paid little attention to fostering local government during their colonization of Laos, the French left a nation woefully short of expertise and leadership. Nor were the French successfully coping with a Lao communist insurrection sponsored by the Vietnamese communists at the time they left Laos. However, the United States, which had assumed an ever greater burden of funding the Royal Lao Government, assumed the counter-insurgency effort against the communists. The resultant Laotian Civil War predated the Vietnam War; unlike in Vietnam, the Laotian war had to be fought under an assumption of secrecy because of the existence of an international treaty, the Geneva Conference (1954). So it was that the Central Intelligence Agency came to support and wage the Lao counter- insurgency.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 13–24.  Operation Hardnose  Operation Hardnose was a road watch operation spying upon the Ho Chi Minh trail that began during the Laotian Civil War. The original concept of the operation was presented to President John F. Kennedy in January 1963.Prados 1998, pp. 37–38. In Summer 1963, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case agent Mike Deuel shifted his base of operations from Nakhon Phanom, Thailand to Pakse, Laos. He acquired promising local agents from the Operation Pincushion program. After advanced training at Phitsanulok, Thailand, in Autumn 1963 the agents were assigned to road watch duties in the section of the Ho Chi Minh trail that ran through Military Region 4 of Laos. They based themselves near Houei Sai on the Bolaven Plateau. Aided by Team T of the Police Aerial Resupply Unit, the Lao Theung spies were so successful that within two months, their efforts were being lauded by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. By December 1963, McNamara was calling for Hardnose's expansionConboy, Morrison, p. 119.Prouty, p. 10. after a whirlwind two-day visit to Vietnam.Gibbons, pp. 211–212. By May 1964, Operation Hardnose had 20 espionage teams surveilling roads and manning radios in the vicinity of Saravane, and southwards to the Cambodian border. By the turn of the year, there were calls for further expansion of Hardnose; additional Thai PARU trainers were brought in.Conboy, Morrison, p. 120. By September, the Hardnose road watchers had reported 5,000 People's Army of Vietnam troops moving south along the Ho Chi Minh trail. This was half again as many infiltrators as had been reported for all of 1964. The quickly growing transportation network included a new road in progress, Route 911, which would trim a third of the distance between the Mụ Giạ Pass and Tchepone.Conboy, Morrison, p. 142. In September 1964, the Southeast Asia Coordination Meeting—a monthly session of U.S. ambassadors, CIA officials, and Department of Defense higherups—decided that Military Assistance Command, Vietnam should be running its own patrols into Operation Hardnose territory. On 7 March 1965, General William Westmoreland tasked the MACV-SOG with cross-border forays from South Vietnam into Laos.Prados 2000, pp. 97–98. On 23 April 1965, Ambassador to Laos William H. Sullivan protested the new project as being what he deemed to be a rerun of the failed Operation White Star. Nor were ground incursions into the Laotian war the only influence of the Vietnam War on Lao operations. The Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound air operations zones were carved out of the Laotian Barrel Roll area and turned over to MACV to run from Vietnam. MACV-SOG also wanted to sponsor a guerrilla base zone east of the Bolovens Plateau between it and the Vietnamese border.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 142–143. By September 1965, MACV-SOG had overcome Sullivan's misgivings concerning Lao neutrality, and had Operation Shining Brass patrols probing the Ho Chi Minh trail from South Vietnam.Prados 2000, pp. 101–102. In October 1965, Mike Deuel had served his three-year tour of duty in Laos. On the 11th, Deuel took his replacement on an orientation flight to distribute the teams' payroll in Salavane. After their departure from there, their Air America Sikorsky H-34's engine quit some outbound. The bodies of the helicopter's occupants were recovered from the crash by Auto Defense Choc militia on 14 October 1965. By late 1965, Operation Hardnose was expanding again. In late October, a team of 21 Royal Thai Special Forces (RTSF) instructors had joined Hardnose at their newly opened base southeast of Houei Kong. North of there, Siberia Training Camp was established northeast of Savannakhet. This camp also received an allotment of RTSF trainers for Hardnose; the RTSF also duplicated the Hardnose program with its own Thai-operated Operation Star of four six-man road watch teams. In February 1966, three unmarked Operation Pony Express CH-3C helicopters were supplied to replace Air America in aerial transport of the Hardnose and Star teams. That same Spring, four teams were captured during a fortnight as the PAVN ramped up counter-surveillance. Eleven more Pony Express helicopters were assigned in June 1966. However, the road watch operations were handicapped by the agents' low level of education, and by language barriers. In the latter half of 1966, there were ten Thai Star teams operating.Conboy, Morrison, p. 144. A contingent of 50 specially recruited Thai agents was heli-lifted in teams into the Ho Chi Minh trail; after three months of failure, the teams were disbanded.Conboy, Morrison, p. 145. Various means of keeping track of traffic on the Ho Chi Minh trail were tried by the teams. In early 1967, the CIA's Technical Services Division forwarded a magnetic traffic sensor to be placed on the trail; however, it failed to keep accurate count or quit entirely. Finally, the CIA altered a U.S. Air Force survival radio into the Hark-1 radio, which had pictures of enemy troops and trucks next to push buttons. A road watch agent who could neither read nor write clicked a button for every soldier or truck counted; the tallies could be then be radioed to a relay aircraft overhead by the touch of another button.  The Hark-1 program  In essence, Hark-1 superseded Operation Hardnose. New CIA trainers were forwarded to the old Hardnose camps in early 1967. The Hark-1 trainer who appeared in February found a troubled situation; the Thais were wrapped up in their Operation Star to the neglect of the CIA's road watch program. A Thai Special Forces Team was promptly dedicated solely to training road watchers, and training facilities for them were expanded. After losing a Continental Air Services, Inc pilot in a fatal crash on 12 March 1967, the Hark-1 program had Air America take over the duty of supplying the airborne radio link to the Hark-1s.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 145–146. The Hark-1 Teams now operated in three zones. The southernmost of these sectors centered on Tchepone, but extended southward to Cambodia. The central section of Hark-1 Teams targeted the Mụ Giạ Pass area; during 1967, 15 teams operated there, with two rotating station within the pass itself. The third Hark-1 zone was Nape Pass. By contrast with American reconnaissance teams, the Lao often unobtrusively hiked long distances into their operational area instead of being inserted by helicopter.Conboy, Morrison, p. 147. Nor were the Lao limited to team service; by now, they had begun to take over recruit training from the Thais.Conboy, Morrison, p. 146. Hark-1 teams stayed in place as long as they went undiscovered and had supplies; some stayed on station for months. Other than occasional cameras, and a short-lived experimentation with night vision scopes, they were sparsely but adequately equipped. The 1967 traffic count showed a 165% increase in trucks on the Trail compared to 1966. Some 4,260 southbound vehicles, and 4,200 northbound, were noted between October 1967 and June 1968. By mid-1968, each of the three Hark-1 zones had about 25 teams in the field.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 147–148. However, U.S. pilots claimed 6,600 trucks destroyed along the trail during the same period. This mismatch in numbers, combined with a sensor surveillance program begun in late 1967, cast doubt on the accuracy of the road watch teams. More importantly, the February 1968 advent of AC-130 Spectre gunships with all their onboard electronic surveillance rendered ground observation largely obsolete. A new military intelligence processing center called Task Force Alpha opened at Nakhon Phanom to collate all sources of information from the trail. By Summer 1969, the road watch teams were dwindling away.Conboy, Morrison, p. 148. The ever-increasing countermeasures of enemy foot patrols and use of tracker dogs also had its effect. In any event, the U.S. air effort against PAVN trucks had reached its limit; it became obvious that no matter the true truck count, air strikes were not going to halt the infiltration. In February 1970, a newly arrived case officer took over the roadwatch program in Military Region IV which had never stopped carrying out roadwatching missions. Based on experience at CIA Headquarters (the road watch reports, having outlived any usefulness, were being ignored) and during his first months running it in-country he shut down roadwatching missions and for the remainder of his two-year assignment he used the former roadwatching assets for other intelligence collection missions.

One account of the enthusiasm after the victory over the Mississippi A & M Aggies that year reads '“If the Orange and Blue can show the same punch and the same speed against a heavier team, it is not believed that the Tigers will have to lower her colors to any team this year,” a story said. Injuries became a concern when 220-pound right guard F.W. Lockwood and 194-pound end G.E. Taylor had knee and ankle problems. Taylor didn't return. “These are the heaviest players on the Auburn squad and their loss deprives the line of any advantage it might have had because of superior weight.”' Lockwood was selected to coach Donahue's all-time Auburn team.

He served as Minister of Industry (1974–1979) and of Public Highways (1979–1980) during the Ferdinand Marcos' government. He later served as member of the Senate of the Philippines from 1987 to 1992. Early life Vicente Tirona Paterno was born in Quiapo, Manila on November 18, 1925 to Jose P. Paterno and Jacoba Encarnacion Tirona. Educational life He is graduate of De La Salle high school class 41 and later on earned his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of the Philippines in 1948 and obtained Master of Business Administration at Harvard University in 1953. Paterno was a lecturer in graduate school of U.P., La Salle and Ateneo de Manila from 1954 to 1962. Personal life He is survived by his wife Baby, his children Judy, Mailin, Maite, Victor and Tina, and his eight grandchildren. Career In October 1982 he founded Philippine Seven Corp. He is known for becoming the first general manager of Phinma and the first Filipino treasurer of Manila Electric Company (Meralco). Paterno started Philippine Seven Corporation in 1982. Popularly known as 7-Eleven, the convenience store has over 1,200 branches in the country. He served as independent director for different companies such as City Resources Phil Corp., Benpres Holdings Corp., Metro Pacific Tollways Corp., Cityland Development Corp. and of First Philippine Holdings. He eventually resigned as his health failed. Paterno won several awards – the 1982 MAP Management Man of the Year, the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Emperor of Japan, and the 2013 Ramon V. del Rosario Award. Political life He was elected as a representative to the Batasang Pambansa following his resignation from the late stronghold former President Ferdinand Marcos’ Kilusang Bagong Lipunan. At the time, he criticized the administration’s response to the assassination of opposition Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. He then became chairman of the National Citizens’ Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) in Metro Manila during the 1986 presidential elections. Afterwards, Paterno, a graduate of the Harvard Business School, was appointed Deputy Executive Secretary for Energy from April 1986 to February 1987, and Chairman of the Philippine National Oil Company from March 1986 to February 1987. Then President Corazon Aquino convinced him to run for senator. He succeeded and served from 1987 to 1992. Death and legacy Former Senator Vicente Paterno died at 8:40 in the morning Friday. He was 89 years old. A report by radio dzBB said the remains of the late senator will be brought to Sanctuario de San Antonio after the cremation at Heritage Park. The wake will start Friday night. Malacañang mourned the death of the former senator, saying the nation has lost a distinguished public servant and exponent of principled governance. “We extend our deepest sympathy to his widow and children; his passing is a loss to the country but his enduring example will remain a constant source of pride for his loved ones and the Filipino people whom he served so well,” deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said in a press statement. She said that as chairman of the BOI and Minister of Public Highways in the Marcos administration, Paterno refused to surrender his independence or integrity and contributed to the rebuilding of the nation after the EDSA Revolution as president of the PNOC. “A respected businessman, he served on the boards of numerous corporations in addition to his family’s own enterprises. Throughout his public life, whether in the halls of government or the boardrooms of the private sector, he was an exponent of honesty, efficiency, faith and love of country,\\" she added. Valte said also notable was Paterno's advocacy of good governance as one of the prime movers in the formation of the advocacy group, Former Senior Government Officials.

Most taxonomic authorities lump this species and the eastern cattle egret together (called the cattle egret), but some (including the International Ornithologists' Union separate them. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century. It is a white bird adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Western cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal. The adult cattle egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases. Taxonomy Breeding adult B. i. ibis with neck retracted. The cattle egret was first described in 1758 by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae as Ardea ibis, but was moved to its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error. Despite superficial similarities in appearance, the cattle egret is more closely related to the genus Ardea, which comprises the great or typical herons and the great egret (A. alba), than to the majority of species termed egrets in the genus Egretta. Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons Egretta caerulea, little egrets Egretta garzetta and snowy egrets Egretta thula have been recorded. Description The cattle egret is a stocky heron with an wingspan; it is long and weighs . It has a relatively short thick neck, a sturdy bill, and a hunched posture. The non-breeding adult has mainly white plumage, a yellow bill and greyish-yellow legs. During the breeding season, adults of the nominate western subspecies develop orange-buff plumes on the back, breast and crown, and the bill, legs and irises become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing. The sexes are similar, but the male is marginally larger and has slightly longer breeding plumes than the female; juvenile birds lack coloured plumes and have a black bill. The positioning of the egret's eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological studies suggest that the species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water. This species gives a quiet, throaty rick-rack call at the breeding colony, but is otherwise largely silent. Distribution and habitat Range expansion in the Americas (click to magnify). The cattle egret has undergone one of the most rapid and wide reaching natural expansions of any bird species. It was originally native to parts of Southern Spain and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa and humid tropical and western Asia. In the end of the 19th century it began expanding its range into southern Africa, first breeding in the Cape Province in 1908. Cattle egrets were first sighted in the Americas on the boundary of Guiana and Suriname in 1877, having apparently flown across the Atlantic Ocean. It was not until the 1930s that the species is thought to have become established in that area. The species first arrived in North America in 1941 (these early sightings were originally dismissed as escapees), bred in Florida in 1953, and spread rapidly, breeding for the first time in Canada in 1962. It is now commonly seen as far west as California. It was first recorded breeding in Cuba in 1957, in Costa Rica in 1958, and in Mexico in 1963, although it was probably established before that. In Europe, the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century it expanded back through the Iberian Peninsula, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe; southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981 and Italy in 1985. Breeding in the United Kingdom was recorded for the first time in 2008 only a year after an influx seen in the previous year. In 2008, cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into Ireland for the first time. The massive and rapid expansion of the cattle egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a commensal relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and dispersive, and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species has been seen as a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia, Marion Island, the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in Fiji in 2008. In addition to the natural expansion of its range, cattle egrets have been deliberately introduced into a few areas. The species was introduced to Hawaii in 1959. Successful releases were also made in the Seychelles and Rodrigues, but attempts to introduce the species to Mauritius failed. Numerous birds were also released by Whipsnade Zoo in England, but the species was never established. Although the cattle egret sometimes feeds in shallow water, unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey. Migration and movements Flying in Dallas with a twig in its beak for its nest. Some populations of cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult for this species. In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas. Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non-breeding season. Young birds are known to disperse up to from their breeding area. Flocks may fly vast distances and have been seen over seas and oceans including in the middle of the Atlantic. Jacutinga, Minas Gerais state, Brazil Status This species has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of . On the other hand, the expansion and establishment of the species over large ranges has led it to be classed as an invasive species (although little, if any impact has been noted yet). Breeding Cattle egret egg. Adult feeding a nestling in Apenheul zoo A non-breeding adult eating a frog in The Gambia Juvenile on Maui (note black bill). The cattle egret nests in colonies, which are often, but not always, found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises and cormorants. The North American breeding season lasts from April to October. In the Seychelles, the breeding season of the subspecies B.i. seychellarum is April to October. The male displays in a tree in the colony, using a range of ritualised behaviours such as shaking a twig and sky-pointing (raising his bill vertically upwards), and the pair forms over three or four days. A new mate is chosen in each season and when re- nesting following nest failure. The nest is a small untidy platform of sticks in a tree or shrub constructed by both parents. Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing is rife. The clutch size can be anywhere from one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. The pale bluish-white eggs are oval-shaped and measure . Incubation lasts around 23 days, with both sexes sharing incubation duties. The chicks are partly covered with down at hatching, but are not capable of fending for themselves; they become capable of regulating their temperature at 9–12 days and are fully feathered in 13–21 days. They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2 weeks, fledge at 30 days and become independent at around the 45th day. The cattle egret engages in low levels of brood parasitism, and there are a few instances of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted. The dominant factor in nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa third and fourth chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. Feeding The cattle egret feeds on a wide range of prey, particularly insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. In a rare instance they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6 times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations like railway lines. A cattle egret will weakly defend the area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and continue foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15 steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food. The cattle egret may also show versatility in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on the eggs and chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration it has also been reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food. Relationship with humans B. i. seychellarum waiting for scraps at the fish market of Victoria, Seychelles. A conspicuous species, the cattle egret has attracted many common names. These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals, and it is known variously as cow crane, cow bird or cow heron, or even elephant bird or rhinoceros egret. Its Arabic name, abu qerdan, means \\"father of ticks\\", a name derived from the huge number of parasites such as avian ticks found in its breeding colonies. The cattle egret is a popular bird with cattle ranchers for its perceived role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets reduced the number of flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii. Not all interactions between humans and cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, and it has been implicated in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.

Early life Ambrose Eldridge was born about 1815 in England, the son of John York Eldridge.  Queensland years  Ambrose Eldridge was a Sydney chemist who arrived in Moreton Bay in late July 1847 to work in John Taggart's Medical Hall, a chemist shop in Queen Street. Taggart eventually sold out to Eldridge, who took over from 1 October 1849, and developed the business as a chemist, druggist, oilman, and grocer. In the late 1840s and 1850s, Eldridge adopted an active and enthusiastic role in the development of Brisbane and Queensland. He was prominent in the Separation movement and served on a wide variety of local committees (for most of which he was a founding member), including those of the Hospital, the proposed Brisbane Market (1851), the Moreton Bay Steam Navigation Company, the Moreton Bay Horticultural Society, the Brisbane Exchange, the Northern Districts Agricultural and Pastoral Association, the Moreton Bay Immigration and Land Company (first chairman of directors in 1855-56), and the Moreton Bay Building Society, which was dissolved in 1854 to re-emerge as the Moreton Bay Permanent Investment and Building Society in 1855. He was active in promoting local issues such as a bridge over Breakfast Creek, a committee to communicate between the electors of Moreton Bay and their representative in the Legislative Council in Sydney, a survey of the Brisbane River entrance and bar, direct emigration to Moreton Bay, government funding to churches, and regularly subscribed to rewards for the discovery of gold in the Moreton and Darling Downs districts. He was a prominent member of St John's Anglican Church, and an active participant in the Brisbane School of Arts and Sciences and the Moreton Bay Musical Society. During the early 1850s his business flourished and he acquired a number of Brisbane town and suburban allotments. Eldridge was a well-respected townsman with a clear commitment to the development of Brisbane at political, civic, economic and social levels, but he was also something of a visionary. Like the indomitable Dr John Dunmore Lang, who envisioned a Moreton Bay populated by yeomen farmers, Eldridge was determined to prove that agriculture in the Northern Districts of New South Wales was economically viable. In the second half of 1851, Eldridge, who had little knowledge of farming, purchased Western Suburban Allotments 4 to 11, totalling over 30 acres, along the northern bank of the Brisbane River, just beyond the town boundary. Here, at what he named Milton Farm, Eldridge experimented with cotton growing, hoping to prove that agriculture at Moreton Bay could be sustained and profitable. Whilst not the only Moreton Bay resident to experiment with cotton-growing at the time, he was initially one of the most successful. Cotton was a logical crop with which to experiment – it was one of the principal import of Great Britain, and an important basis of her manufacturing industry, and if grown successfully at Moreton Bay, would ensure the prosperity of the Northern Districts of New South Wales, and enhance local aspirations for Separation. By September 1852, five acres of the Milton land had been cleared, and were planted the following month with seeds of the finest Sea Island Cotton. At the close of 1852, Eldridge retired from business, selling the Medical Hall and devoting his time to the Milton experiment. Side view of Milton House with the Manning family on the verandah, 1868 Eldridge erected Milton House in 1852 or 1853. It was the first substantial house in the area and soon a local landmark, being prominent in early views of Brisbane. It was the base for Eldridge's experimental farming when the Moreton Bay region was struggling to establish itself, and later for John Frederick McDougall's considerable pastoral holdings in the area. By June 1853 the first crop of Milton cotton was being picked, yielding at least 20 bales. Eldridge reported in the local press that, not including the cost of land and land clearing, he had expended £38 in the experiment, and had made a profit of £14. That December he was awarded first prize of £30 by the New South Wales Government, for samples of the cotton sent to Sydney in a government-sponsored competition. Two years later he sent samples of the Milton cotton to the Paris Exhibition of 1855, where it was highly acclaimed. In 1853, Eldridge expanded his efforts to promote profitable local farming, taking up on long lease approximately 400 acres at Eagle Farm. By late 1854 this land had been cleared, and in March 1855, Eldridge announced his intention of removing to Eagle Farm, and selling the Milton Estate. The Eldridges resided at Milton through the remainder of 1855, but the property, including a mansion house was sold and transferred to pastoralist John Frederick McDougall in January 1856, for £2,300. For Eldridge, the move spelt disaster. On 28 September 1856, his wife Mary after giving birth to a son at Eagle Farm. The farming experiments at Eagle Farm appear to have failed, and by 1859 he had returned to the chemist business, opening a shop at Ipswich.

The 1914 Vols were retroactively awarded a national championship by 1st-N-Goal, though this remains largely unrecognized. One account of the Sewanee game reads \\"Mush Kerr played a wonderful game in the line as did Capt. Kelly. The work of the Tennessee line was easily the feature of the contest, and Sewanee early discovered that it was practically useless to rely on line plunges to gain ground.\\" Educator After completing his formal education, Kerr was coach and teacher of Mathematics and science at Amory, Mississippi. He resigned that position to join the teaching staff at Tennessee Polytechnic Institute at Cooksville.

Atlantic Cod were originally found in the Atlantic Ocean, along the borders of both Canada and England and all the way down to the southern United States. Heavy fishing in these areas, in the late 1800s and early 1900s led to a massive decline in Cod population. Today, they are grown in onshore temperature controlled, seawater tanks as eggs and eventually taken to sea cages when more developed. The majority of these artificial environments found in Canada, are located in British Columbia, New Brunswick and as well as Newfoundland and Labrador. It takes about 6 months for the fish to hatch followed by a 2 to 3-year period for them to reach their maximize selling size, therefore taking an average of 3 years for a fish to reach market which is 3 to 5 kg. According to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2014) in 2013 1 kg of Cod was being sold for on average $7.12 fish. Overall, Atlantic Cod are a relatively recent farmed fish, however are gaining popularity due to price, nutrition and feed to growth ratio. Raising Atlantic Cod In our modern society almost all fish, including Atlantic Cod, are now produced through aquaculture. Aquaculture is defined as \\"the rearing (raising) of aquatic animals or the cultivation of aquatic plants for food\\". The raising of Atlantic Cod starts with the selection of the best female stock breed. These fish are selected from previously grown market fish, located in off shore sea cages. They are selected based on weight; typically the heavier the fish the more eggs it can produce. The female fish are breed in onshore tank facilities and can produce 450,000 eggs per kg of body weight. After separating the females, the eggs are incubated in a temperature controlled tank for about 14 days until hatching. The baby cod or 'larvae' are then transferred to larval tanks. During this stage the larvae are feed yolk from a yolk sack for 3 to 4 days. After this period, once the larvae have grown large enough, they are fed tiny planktonic animals (ground plankton). Then after a duration of 35 to 40 days of being fed planktonic animals, the larvae should have undergo metamorphosis and are now considered fish. They are removed from the larval tanks and put into circular tanks in an onshore facility. They remain in this stage for 6 months or until they are 10 to 20 grams or centimeters in length. After they have reached this, size a microchip is sometimes inserted into the fish to monitor growth and collect information. Finally the fish are taken to sea cage sites via industrial trucks and barges. In the sea cages the Cod will grow until they reach market weight which can take 24 to 36 months. During that period all fish are fed, and cage sites cleaned on a daily basis to maintain the healthiest standards. Facilities and equipment In commercial aquaculture there are two main areas of farming: the onshore facility and the offshore sea cages. In the onshore facility there are a number of storage tanks that are key to the early development of Cod and many other cold water fish. These livestock storage include: the incubators (where eggs are fertilized and allowed to hatch), the larval tanks (slightly larger tanks where the larvae is grown), the circular tanks (last stage before fish leave the onshore facility, where metamorphosis occurs) and finally storage tanks where the fish can be temporarily stored as they are transported from truck, to boat, to sea site. Before the fish are taken to sea cage sites, some companies insert microchips into the fish to monitor population and patterns in the fish to improve the raising for future generations. The microchips are removed once fish are ready for market. After being transported to the ocean via private company or government ships, the fish are gently poured into a sea cage. There are many different types of sea cages depending on the location and style of aquaculture. Some common sea containers include: aqua pod (completely sealed bubble), open water (with the hope that the fish will naturally return), sea cages (simple netting tied to the ocean floor), and raceways (often in rivers or ponds). Some facilities (non-coastal regions) contain land based re circulation where all fish are in an indoor water circulated facility. The most common of these however is the sea cages, due to its inexpensive and ability to hold lots of fish. Finally with any of these sites a vacuum system must be present at the bottom of the water facility to absorb fish feces and to circulate the water. This prevents any chance of disease and improves water quality. Labor In both onshore and offshore facilities Cod require daily maintenance. In the onshore facility an estimated team of 4 or 5 laborers are required for daily tasks, which include: feeding planktonic animals, regulating tank temperatures, monitoring health of fish (removing any sick fish), and general maintenance to the water facilities. One must also consider labor for transport, which would include a truck driver, a machine operator (fork lift/crane for moving fish) and a team operating a sea barge (is located far enough off shore). Transport and sea cage crew included would be an estimated 10 people depending on the size of the operation. Inputs As mentioned earlier in the egg stage of development, Cod are fed yolk, followed by planktonic animals (ground plankton) in the larvae stage, and finally a pellet feed after leaving the onshore facility. The pellets fed to Atlantic Cod are mostly grain based, which are made of fish oil, bone meal, vitamins and minerals. Atlantic Cod have a 1 kg of feed to 1 kg of weight gain ratio. In some open water environments, this ratio is even more efficient, because Cod will eat other small natural organisms in the water. Cod fish are actually carnivorous animals and will even eat each other if prevalent size ratios are available. However aquatic farms have recently been trying to turn Atlantic Cod's carnivorous diet to a more herbivorous one; as already done in chickens This would drastically lower the already low price of feed for future generations. ;Nutritional information Once market size is reached, Atlantic Cod fish offer a bounty of nutrients including a surplus amount of complete proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, iron and B vitamins. A serving or 98g of Atlantic Cod offers us 40% of our daily protein intake, while at the same time containing low sodium levels Atlantic Cod when compared to other meat have a much lower level of saturated fat, while still holding a high protein level. In comparison, 98g of chicken provides about 18g of protein (under 40%). ;Benefits to Canada Atlantic Cod gives a direct 8000 full-time jobs in Canada and this number is growing. More jobs are becoming available due to increase in demand for fish. In 1986 Canadian Aquaculture production was valued at 35 million, by 2006 it was valued at 912 million and this pace is still growing as illustrated in figure 1. The jobs being created by this industry are also 90% located in rural, Aboriginal or small coastal cities. Just one example of this is in B.C, Kitasoo First Nation community, where aquaculture helped reduce unemployment to zero from 80 percent. Also an analysis by Indian and Northern Affairs determined that 61 First Nations could support salmon farms, 130 could develop trout farms and 123 would have access to clam, mussel and oyster farming. ;Constraints After the near extinction of natural Atlantic Cod in the wild, strict laws were made to prevent fishing of any sort. This led to aquaculture. However, the fishing industry in Canada is severely limited and regulated. 73 pieces of federal and provincial legislation regulates what is exactly allowed. Any new aquaculture of any sort is not allowed in Ontario. Only coastal areas like British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador or New Brunswick are free to build more fish farms under permission from the government. Environmental sustainability Aquaculture (fish farming) is used for all Atlantic Cod production, so that the environment and natural (wild) fish species are essentially unaffected. Fish are sold without further processing, so little to none of the animal is wasted. The only environmental concern from Atlantic Cod is excess nutrients produced in their feces. If left un-filtered in natural environments, these feces could lead to denitrification. However, in almost all commercial fish farms, feces are utilized (via vacuum) as liquid fertilizer, to be used for farm activities. Other beneficial environment factors are: factories are not required for further processing and feed source has minimal requirements from environment. Finally aquaculture developments need in-depth environmental review which includes Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA), to prevent harm from ocean habitats. Organic Atlantic Cod is also available as an alternative product. These fish are prohibited from antibiotics, herbicides, GMOs, parasiticides and practices that minimize negative effects on the environment. Alternative products Aquaculture in Canada has a variety of different products to offer. In Canada the top aquaculture products are Salmon and mussels followed by trout. Although these products are popular in North America, they would be too expensive in a developing country. An affordable alternative could be Canadian Arctic Char, or Canadian Farmed Talapia. Both fish are farmed in Canada and have similar environment friendly regulations and benefits as Atlantic Cod does to Canada.

In 1843, the Harvard Corporation officially adopted it as a seal, and the seal in use today is very similar. Extension School The coat of arms for the Harvard Extension School was approved in 1983. At the top of the shield the three books spelling out Veritas (Latin, \\"truth\\") represent graduate education; a similar arrangement is seen on the arms of Harvard's law school, medical school, and other graduate schools. Instead of a straight line separating it from the rest of the shield, as is found in the other schools, a line with six arcs pointing up was used instead. A silver chevron was used to represent undergraduate education, a device used in the shield of Harvard College in the 17th to 19th centuries. Two bushels of wheat are included to represent John Lowell's stipulation that courses should not cost more than two bushels of wheat. A golden lamp symbolizes both learning and the fact that some classes are taught at night. References Sources  * *Harvard University. Corporation. Seals, 1650-[1926].

Early life Giles Guthrie was born in Westminster, London on 21 March 1916. His father was Connop Thirlwall Robert Guthrie, a merchant banker and public servant, and his mother was Eila Mary Guthrie (née McEacharn), eldest daughter of Sir Malcolm McEacharn, an Australian shipping magnate and former Mayor of Melbourne. He was educated at Eton College and at Magdalene College, Cambridge. His father, Connop, had served as an officer during the early stages of World War I but following injury, managed the American operations of the Ministry of Shipping. He took up business roles after the war, directing City General Trust before purchasing North Central Wagon Company in a joint venture with Prudential Assurance in 1928. He served as North Central Wagon Company's chairman from 1928 to 1939. Connop was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1918 New Year Honours for his war service with the Ministry of Shipping, and the Guthrie baronetcy was created for Connop in the 1936 New Year Honours. Flying career Guthrie learned to fly on the de Havilland Tiger Moth whilst a student at Eton College aged 16, and was awarded his Private pilot licence on turning 17. He continued flying whilst at Cambridge, taking ownership of a Percival Vega Gull, an aircraft he flew extensively in 1936 and 1937, competing in several competitions as a co-pilot to Charles Gardner. Their partnership culminated in their victory in the 1936 King's Cup Race. C. W. A. Scott and Giles Guthrie (as co-pilot) won The Schlesinger African Air Race (a race between Portsmouth and Johannesburg) in 1936, flying Guthrie's Vega Gull. The Guthrie Wing of King's College Hospital was named in his honour to commemorate their victory. Guthrie replaced his Vega Gull with the Percival Mew Gull, a dedicated racing aircraft, in 1937, and in the same year, he was awarded his commercial pilot license. Gardner and Guthrie retained the King's Cup Race in 1937, having flown the Mew Gull. He piloted the Mew Gull himself in 1938, coming second to future Supermarine Spitfire test pilot Alex Henshaw, who was also flying a Percival Mew Gull. They both completed the course at an average speed well in excess of , Henshaw at and Guthrie at . He went to work for British Airways, where he held a number of roles in the traffic and commercial departments. His fluency in French and German meant he was stationed in Paris, Berlin and finally Warsaw, with his posting there lasting until 29 August 1939, two days before the German invasion of Poland and four days before the formal declaration of war between the United Kingdom and Germany. =World War II= World War II would see Guthrie serve as a pilot with the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm. He trained at HMS Raven (Eastleigh) before joining 808 Naval Air Squadron. His first posting with 808 Naval Air Squadron was on dockyard and Scapa Flow protection duties, flying Fairey Fulmars from various bases around the British coast. 808 Naval Air Squadron was next assigned to the aircraft carrier together with 807 Naval Air Squadron, operating in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theatres. This posting lasted from September 1940 to November 1941, when Ark Royal was sunk by an enemy torpedo. Guthrie was on board at the time. 808 Naval Air Squadron pilots, including Guthrie, would also fly Hawker Hurricane aircraft from Gibraltar during this time. Guthrie and other personnel aboard HMS Ark Royal were recognised for their gallantry in the Mediterranean; Guthrie was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his involvement in a sortie defending a Maltese convoy from enemy action, despite being significantly outnumbered by enemy aircraft. The sinking of Ark Royal saw 808 Naval Air Squadron merge with 807 Naval Air Squadron and disband, reforming a year later. Guthrie did not join the merged 807 Naval Air Squadron; instead he returned to the UK and joined the Naval Air Fighting Development Unit (NAFDU) operating from RAF Duxford, alongside their RAF counterpart, the Air Fighting Development Unit. There, Guthrie was involved in flight testing almost every single- and twin- engined aircraft entering service with the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm, and involving himself in development work, such as testing the Wilbur R. Franks designed G-suit in Supermarine Seafires. Guthrie remained with the NAFDU until the end of the war, by which time he had risen to second in command and promoted to acting lieutenant commander. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (OBE) in the 1946 New Year Honours. He flew a Chrislea Ace and a Stinson Reliant from Gatwick Airport after the war, but increasing demands on both his time and that of Gatwick Airport resulted in his eventual retirement from flying, and he let his pilots licence lapse after 1953. Business career Guthrie had initially been offered a role with British Overseas Airways Corporation immediately after the war, but the death of his father on 28 September 1945 made this difficult and he would instead manage the Guthrie family's business interests, which included the shareholding in North Central Wagon Company. He was appointed to the board of North Central in August 1946, at their annual general meeting. He initially asked Edward Heath in 1946 to join North Central as the deputy chairman, with a view to him taking over as chairman, but Heath, who was interested in running for Parliament, thought moving from London to Rotherham, where North Central was based, would be damaging to his political ambitions and turned down the offer. Guthrie, in addition to his North Central role, served as managing director of the merchant bank Brown, Shipley & Co., and he would again offer Edward Heath a role, in 1949, as a trainee banker. The role was to provide a source of income for Heath, who had already been selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Bexley, and who would be elected to Parliament at the 1950 General Election, held in February. Guthrie took up the deputy chairman role at North Central Wagon Company himself, serving from 1960 to 1964. He also served on the board of Radio Rentals until 1964, and served on the board of Prudential Assurance Company from May 1963 to January 1964. He was appointed to fill the vacant seat on the Prudential board created by the death of Donald Fergusson in March 1963, and it was widely expected he would become Prudential's chairman. =Aviation industry= His knowledge of aviation and finance made him an ideal candidate for board positions with the state-owned British airlines; firstly he was appointed to the board of British European Airways in April 1959 then in 1963, he was appointed to the board of British Overseas Airways Corporation, where he took over from Matthew Slattery as chairman and Basil Smallpeice as managing director, taking the additional title of chief executive. He took up his position on 1 January 1964, relinquishing all but his British European Airways board appointment when taking up the BOAC role; the Government wished for closer co-operation between BOAC and BEA, and it was agreed that Guthrie would remain on the BEA board to facilitate this. Guthrie joined the Air Registration Board (predecessor of the Civil Aviation Authority) in September 1964, serving as an airline representative. He was appointed at the same time as his predecessor at BOAC, Matthew Slattery and aircraft engine designer Stanley Hooker. He also served on the executive committee of the International Air Transport Association from 1964 to 1968. BOAC was suffering from significant financial problems when Guthrie took over, and the airline had run at a loss from 1958 through to 1963, returning to profitability in 1963–1964. BOAC's debt stood at approximately £80 million by 1964, all financed by the government. This indebtedness was further exacerbated by the airline being ordered by the government to purchase British-built aircraft it had little or no requirement for, and as a result, a capital borrowing facility of £180 million was made available in 1961–1962 to finance the purchase of 35 Vickers VC10 jet aircraft. The plans to acquire the Vickers VC10, which would eventually call for a fleet of 45 to be purchased by 1967, resulted in the resignations of Matthew Slattery, Guthrie's predecessor as chairman, and his managing director, Basil Smallpeice. They believed BOAC had no requirement for all the aircraft ordered, that the Vickers VC10 would be too expensive to operate, and that the government's 'Buy British' policy would prevent the airline from returning to profitability. Guthrie was employed specifically to tackle the financial issues at the airline and restore its long-term profitability. His initial proposals involved complementary decisions to reduce the number of destinations and routes served, and scaling back the size of the fleet, which was planned to reach 100 aircraft by 1970. Guthrie initially planned for a fleet of 39 aircraft by 1967, consisting of the 12 Vickers Standard VC10s which had been delivered or which were under construction, and 27 Boeing 707s. This would be achieved by cancelling the order for 30 Vickers Super VC10 aircraft and purchasing 6 additional Boeing 707 jets instead, with more ordered if needed. His final request when taking up his appointment was that the airline's debt of £80m should be written off by the government, and the company refinanced, as if it was a new start-up. Julian Amery, Minister of Aviation agreed to the majority of Guthrie's plan, the only major exception being the outright cancellation of the Vickers VC10, which wasn't authorised. The routes to South America were divested to British United Airways, the debt owed to government was written off and refinancing of the airline completed with an investment of £30m from the government. Amery allowed the order for 30 Super VC10s to be reduced to 17 aircraft; three of the remaining aircraft were diverted to the Royal Air Force and the remaining 10 airframes cancelled during early production, which would give BOAC a fleet of 29 Vickers VC10 aircraft in total. Guthrie resumed flying and captained proving flights of the VC10, including a transatlantic demonstration to Boston. BOAC were permitted to purchase two Boeing 707 freighters during 1965 and after taking full ownership of the BOAC-Cunard joint venture, the two Boeing 707 passenger jets which Cunard Line had contributed to the joint venture (through their Cunard Eagle Airways subsidiary) passed to BOAC. Passenger growth and load factors quickly increased under Guthrie's tenure, and he invested in larger aircraft with more passenger capacity than either the Vickers Super VC10 or the Boeing 707 could provide. Boeing and Pan American World Airways had worked together to develop the Boeing 747 and it quickly became apparent that to compete with Pan American on the north Atlantic routes, BOAC would need to operate either the Boeing 747 or a broadly comparable jet. Guthrie successfully resisted pressure to purchase a proposed double-deck variant of the Vickers Super VC10, and was given permission to place an order for six Boeing 747-100 aircraft in August 1966. Guthrie's tenure at BOAC was marred by a two fatal incidents; the first, BOAC Flight 911, occurred in March 1966 when a Boeing 707 experienced clear-air turbulence whilst overflying Mount Fuji in Japan. The crash resulted in the deaths of all 124 passengers and crew, the most deadly accident involving a British airline to date. Guthrie travelled to Japan to be involved in the investigation. The second fatal accident, BOAC Flight 712, also involved a Boeing 707. The aircraft suffered an un-contained engine failure during takeoff; returning to Heathrow, the engine separated from the wing, causing the wing to catch fire. The aircraft cabin was destroyed by fire, and five people were killed. Guthrie would attempt to deal with industrial relations issues and strike action which affected BOAC, like many state-owned companies in the 1960s and 1970s. He was largely successful and left the company with only a pay dispute with pilots unresolved, an issue that would continue on for several more years, delaying the Boeing 747's introduction by a year to 1971. He was responsible for cutting the executive headcount by a quarter, and more than 3,000 staff made redundant, with some being replaced by the new computer systems he introduced to streamline the business. He announced in May 1968 that he did not wish to be re-appointed for a second five-year term as chairman and chief executive of BOAC, relinquishing his BOAC appointment and related board positions at the end of 1968. BOAC had made £62 million in profits since 1964 and generated cash reserves of almost £80 million at the time of his announcement. Guthrie, when interviewed in The Times days before his formal resignation, explained that the airline had public dividend capital of £50 million, the government loan capital of £30 million and £61 million in cash reserves, and with an expected profit of £12 million to £15 million in 1968–1969, BOAC's finances would be almost exactly where he had intended them to be when he took up his role in 1964; he wanted £80 million in capital and £80 million in reserves at the end of the five-year period running from 1964 to 1968. He also indicated the problems inherent with the separate BOAC and BEA structures during this interview, something that would be resolved when BOAC and BEA merged to form British Airways in March 1974. Other interests Guthrie's exit from BOAC allowed him to establish Air Transport Insurance and Air Transport Guarantee, mutual self-insurance pools owned by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Air Transport Association of America with the purpose of partially insuring their members new Boeing 747 aircraft. He would serve as Air Transport Insurance and Air Transport Guarantee's chairman alongside director-general Clarence Pell until 1971. In 1966, the Guthries survived an armed robbery attempt at their Gatwick home and Giles wife, Rhona, was shot when she tried to disarm a burglar who was aiming a gun at Giles. He believed that Rhona had saved his life in the process. The armed robbery prompted the Guthrie family to move to the Channel Island of Jersey the same year. They purchased a sizeable house situated in its own valley, and Rhona, Lady Guthrie set about renovating the overgrown gardens. Guthrie once again became involved in local government after his move to Jersey, he served as the chairman of a Water Inquiry Board set up by Jersey's Public Works Committee. He had previously served as a magistrate in West Sussex in 1955. He was a keen sportsman; he played cricket for Lowfield Heath Cricket Club, prior to the expansion of Gatwick Airport which resulted in the village of Lowfield Heath being redeveloped. He was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club and of the Royal Yacht Squadron where he owned and raced several yachts. Guthrie and other members of the Royal Yacht Squadron were interested in challenging for the Americas Cup in 1961, but decided against mounting a challenge. Guthrie would have led a syndicate owning one of four boats, the fastest of which would have gone forward to challenge the New York Yacht Club for the trophy.

His family name is Shapiro, his stage name is Guidall a permutation of Gedalyah, his Hebrew name. Guidall's father was a pharmacist, and his four brothers also went into the medical profession. Guidall bucked the trend and went into theater. He received a master's degree in social work in his 50s, going on to provide counseling during the day while acting at night. He heard about audiobook narration through a fellow actor. Guidall lives in White Plains, New York and narrates his works in a small basement studio in nearby Irvington, New York. He typically takes 3 to 4 days to complete a book. His narrations include Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow in 1986, and then again in 2014 as a new recording. Guidall said the book took about 1 month working full-time daily and was one of his most difficult works. Guidall says he reads all his books beforehand and seeks to understand the book, not to just impart information but emotion and performance. Guidall says many narrators are \\"just reading out loud. They don't have an emotional underpinning. There’s a rhythm to speech in terms of what's implied. If it's raining in the book, there’s got to be something about the voice that evokes the rain.\\" Guidall says audiobook narration \\"expands the author's intent, brings it into an immediacy.

Life and career He is the son of Aizik Guberman (writer, poet) and his wife Etya (teacher). From 1947 to 1952 Guberman studied at the Institute of Electrical Communications, Odessa, USSR, graduating in radio engineering. From 1952 to 1958 he worked as field geophysicist in the Soviet oil industry. From 1958 to 1961 he studied as a postgraduate at the Oil and Gas Institute in Moscow. In 1962 he received a PhD. in nuclear physics, followed by a PhD. in applied mathematics in 1971. In 1971 he was appointed for full professorship in computer science. After authoring the first applied pattern recognition program in 1962, Guberman specialized in artificial intelligence implementing principles of Gestalt perception in computer programs for geological data analysis. In 1966 he was invited by the outstanding mathematician of the XX century Prof. I. Gelfand to lead the Artificial Intelligence team in Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He applied the pattern recognition technology to earthquake prediction, oil and gas exploration, handwriting recognition, speech compression, and medical imaging. From 1989 to 1992 Guberman held the chair professorship at Moscow Open University (Department of Geography). Since 1992 he is living in the US. Guberman is the inventor of the handwriting recognition technology implemented in the commercial product by the company \\"Paragraph International\\" founded by S. Pachikov, and used today by Microsoft in Windows CE.cf. In-Q-Tel communication, June 3, 2003 He is author of core technologies for five US companies, and owns a patent on speech compression.Patent information Achievements =Handwriting recognition= The common approach to computer handwriting recognition was computer learning on a set of examples (characters or words) presented as visual objects. Guberman proposed that it is more adequate for the psycho-physiology of human perception to present the script as a kinematic object, a gesture, i.e. synergy of movements of the stylus producing the script. Guberman, S., Rosenzweig V., The algorithm for recognizing handwritten texts. Avtomatika iTelemekhanika (Automation and Telemechanics), 1976, No. 5, 122-129. http://www.mathnet.ru/links/bf03dbbad5ab64f2c87620b72bfc7c89/at7838.pdf. Primitivs Transformation of lettersThe handwriting consists of 7 primitives. The variations, which characters undergo during the writing, are restricted by the rule: each element can be transformed only into his neighbor in the ordered sequence of primitives. During the evolution of Latin-like writing acquired resistance to natural variations in character shape: when one of the primitives is substituted by his neighbor the interpretation of the character does not change to another one. Based on this approach two USA companies Paragraph and Parascript developed the first commercial products for on-line and off-line free handwriting recognition, which were licensed by Apple, Microsoft, Boeing, Siemens and others.

The difference is that in the classical mirroring phenomena the motor response appears in parallel with the observed movement (“immediate action perception”), and during the handwriting recognition the static stimulus is transformed into a time process by tracing the path of the pen on the paper. In both cases the observer is trying to understand the intention of the correspondent: “the understanding of what the person is doing and why he is doing it, is acquired through a mechanism that directly transforms visual information into a motor format”Rizzolatti G, Fabbri-Destro M. Mirror neurons: From discovery to autism. Exp Brain Res (2010) 200:223–237 DOI 10.1007/s00221-009-2002-3. = Speech parallel coding= The speech is traditionally presented as a time sequence of phonemes - vowels and consonants Jakobson R., Waugh R., (2002). The Sound Shape of Language. Walter de Gruyter. https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/10801. Each vowel is mainly determined by the relationship between the volume sizes of the front and the back of the voice tract. The ratio is defined by 1) horizontal position of tongue (back–forth), 2) the position of the lips (back- forth), and 3) the size of pharynx that can extend the cavity of the voice tract far back. Most consonants can be described with 3 parameters: 1) place of articulation (lips, teeth and so on), 2) time pattern of interaction with the voice tract (explosive or not), and 3) voiced or not voiced sound. Because of the inertia of the articulatory organs (tongue, lips, jaw) any phoneme interferes with the neighbors and changes its sounding (co-articulation). As a result, each phoneme sounds different in different context. Guberman presents the parallel model of speech production Guberman S. and Andreevsky E.., 1996, from Language pathology to Automatic Language Recognition ... and Return. Cybernetics and Human Knowing, 3, 41–53.. It states that vowels and consonants are generated not in sequence but in parallel. The two channels manage two different gropes of muscles, which together define the geometry of the voice tract, and, respectively, voice signal. The separation is possible because the generation of vowels and of consonants involves different muscles. For the vowels [o], [u] the lips are managed by muscles Mentalis and Orbicularis Oris for protrusion and rounding, and for [i], [e] by Buccinator and Risorius for retracting the lips. The tongue participate in creating the vowels by innervating Superior Longitudinal and Vertical for lifting and for moving the whole tongue back and forth, and Genioglossus for all consonants articulated in the front of the mouth )when jaw is fixed)USLA Linguistics. Muscles of the Speech Production Mechanism https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/manual%20files/appendixb.pdf. For the lip consonant [p], [b], [v], [f] the lips are managed by Labii Inferioris and Orbicularis Oris muscles for moving the lips and the jaw up and down, and Zygomaticus Minor for moving the lower lip back for [v], [f]. From the hypothesis of Parallel Phonetic Coding follows: 1\\\\. Because the vowels are defined as a particular ratio of front and back volumes of voice tract, the vowels are present at any moment of the speech (even during silence – the neutral vowel [ə] when no muscle of the voice tract is innervated). 2\\\\. Any consonant in speech appears on the background of a vowel. The last consonant in the word, is pronounced on the background of the neutral vowel [ə]. In clusters the consonants are produced in parallel with [ə] except the last one. In the past in Russian writing after consonant at the end of the word has to be written a special character denoting the neutral vowel – Ъ (the rule was canceled in 1918).(N) Writing words soda and word in parallel code 3\\\\. The correct written code for words soda and word is shown in (N) where the number of vowels in syllable reflects the relative duration of the vowel. Such coding is used in Hebrew: in the word יצֵירֵ (peace) two points under characters denote vowel [e]). In Arabic the two channels carry different functions: the consonant stream keeps the meaning, (the root), and the vowel stream either modify the meaning of the root, or expresses a grammatical category: kitab means “book”; katib “writer”; ia-ktub-u “he is writing”; ma-ktab “school”. =Giant oil/gas fields exploration = Prognostic map of Andes of South America published in 1986. Red and green circles – sites predicted as future discoveries of giant oil/gas fields. Red circles – where giants were really discovered. Green ones are still underdeveloped.In the '70s and '80s Guberman developed an artificial intelligence software and the appropriate technology for geological applications, and used it for predicting places of giant oil/gas deposits.

The model proposed by Prof. Yury Pikovsky (Moscow State University) assumes that petroleum moves from the mantel to the surface through permeable channels created at the intersection of deep faultsPikovsky Y. Natural and Technogenic Flows of Hydrocarbons in the Environment. Moscow University Publishing, 1993. The technology uses 1) maps of morphostructural zoning (method proposed and developed by Prof. E.Rantsman), which outlines the morphostructural nodes (intersections of faults), and 2) pattern recognition program that identify nodes containing giant oil/gas fields. It was forecasted that eleven nodes, which had not been developed at that time, contain giant oil or gas fields. These 11 sites covered only 8% of the total area of all the Andes basins. 30 years later (in 2018) was published the result of comparing the prognosis and the realityGuberman S., Pikovsky Y. The field test confirms the prognosis of the location of giant oil and gas fields in the Andes of South America made in 1986. Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0553-1.. Since publication of the prognostic map in 1986, only six giant oil/gas fields were discovered in the Andes region: Cano–Limon, Cusiana, Capiagua, and Volcanera (Llanos basin, Colombia), Camisea (Ukayali basin, Peru), and Incahuasi (Chaco basin, Bolivia). All discoveries were made in places shown on the 1986 prognostic map as promising areas. The result is convincingly positive, and this is a strong contribution in support of abiogenic theory of oil origin. =D-waves theory= In the middle of the 20th century, the attention of seismologists was attracted by the phenomenon of chains of earthquakes consistently arising along big faultsMogi K. Migration of seismic activity. Bull. EarthquakeRes.Inst., 46, 53, 1968.Wood M.D. and Allen S.S. Nature,244, 5413, 1973.. Later it was interpreted as waves of tectonic strain E. V. Vilkovich, Sh. A. Guberman, and V. I. Keilis-Borok, Tectonic strain waves along large faults. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 219(1), 77 (1974). K. Mogi, Bull. Earthquake Res. Inst. 46, 53 (1968). In 1975 Guberman proposed the D-waves theory that separates the local processes of stress accumulation and the triggering of earthquakes.Guberman, Sh A. \\"On some regularities of the occurrence of earthquakes.\\" Doklady Akademii Nauk. Vol. 224. No. 3. Russian Academy of Sciences, 1975. The basic postulates of this theory are: a) a strong earthquake changes the distribution of mass in the Earth’s core and accordingly its rate of rotation ω; b) at times when ω reaches a local minimum the disturbances occur at both poles, which propagate along meridians at a constant rate of 0.15°/year (D waves); c) A strong earthquake occurs at the place where tectonic stresses have accumulated, and at a time when two D waves (from poles N and S) have met at that point. (Fig ). This hypothesis and its consequences were supported by seismological data. Alaska D-waves 1\\\\. The postulate c) is presented at the plot ( ) where φ is a latitude of a strong earthquake, and T is its time of occurrence. Each line presents a D-wave travelling the Earth with constant speed 0.15°/year triggering along the way strong earthquakes. The dots present the strong earthquake in the Aleutian Islands and Alaska (magnitude M ≥ 7.0). Similar results were demonstrated for California, South-eastern Europe, Asia Minor, Southern Chile, South Sandwich Island, New Zealand, France and Italy Sh.A. Guberman. D-waves and earthquakes. Computational Seismology, Vol. 12, Allerton Press Inc., 1979.The probability that this can happen by chance is < 0,025 in each case. 2\\\\. The source of irregularity in Earth rotation could be a strong earthquake, which displaced huge masses of rocks, and China: A chain of strong earthquakes triggered by D-waves (180–1902 A.D.)for keeping the rotational moment of the Earth constant the angular speed of rotation ω has to be changed Gross, R.S., 1986. The influence of earthquakes on the Chandler wobble during 1977–1983G. GeophysJ. ., E5, 16l-177. Rochester, M.G., 1984. Causes of fluctuations in the rotation of the Earth. Phil. Trans.R. Soc. Lond. A 313, 95-105. Because of the low speed of the D-waves (0.15°/year), it takes more than 200 years after occurrence to reach the areas where earthquakes with magnitude M >8 occur. To test the postulate b) very long time interval of seismological records is needed. In China, the seismic history has been documented for a very long period of time (from 180 A.D.). The time-space relations between the 6 strongest documented earthquakes in China are presented at the plot. The earthquake #1 created at the poles two D-waves. The one moves from the North Pole, and in 332 years triggered the earthquake #2; the second wave moves from the South Pole, and in 858 years achieved the location of the earthquake #4, and so on (see the graph). In total, the average deviation of the position of the D-wave at the time of the event and the location of the triggered earthquake is 0.4°, which is less than the error in determining the position of the epicenter of the historical earthquakes. 3\\\\. From the hypothesis of D-waves it follows that epicenters of the strongest earthquakes can predominantly occur at the discrete D-latitudes (90/2n)·i (i = 0, 1, 2, …), with n ≤ 5 Guberman, S., Confinement of strongest earthquakes of the circumPacific belt to specific latitudes, Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, vol. 265, No. 4, 840–844, 1982. . To test this statement the areas of high seismicity on the Earth were divided in stripes parallel to D-latitudes of order <= 4 each 5.625° width (see the map). Position of strong earthquakes relative to the D-latitudes In 43 regions earthquakes with M ≥ 8.0 occurred, in each region the strongest earthquake was chosen, and in 31 regions the epicenter of the strongest earthquake are located close to the D-latitude, i.e. located in the stripe around the D-latitude 1° wide. The stripe is 1° wide, and occupies 0.36 part of the area of each region, which is 5.625° wide. If the epicenters are randomly scattered over each of the 43 regions, the expected number of epicenters, which will occur close to the D-latitude would be 43 x 0.36 = 15, and the probability that 31 epicenter will be located inside the stripe is less than 0.005. The earthquakes are an essential part of tectonic movements on the Earth. It was shown that strong earthquakes occur in the intersection of faults – morphostructural nodes . It means that not only the earthquakes are located near the D-latitudes, but also the big morphostructural knots do as well. Combining it with Prof Pikovsky’s hypothesis that the morphostructural knots are pipes that deliver the oil from the mantle to the crust of the Earth follows that big oil/gas fields has also be predominantly located at the discrete D-latitudes. It was proved in Guberman S., Pikovsky Y. Distribution of Oil and Gas Fields with Respect to Disjunktive Seismic Nodes. Izvestia, Earth Physics.v. 20, N 11, 1983 ., and the appropriate parameter (distance to the D-latitude) was used in the search for giant oil/gas fields (see above). The fact that the strong earthquakes occur on discrete D-latitudes influences the tectonic configuration of the net of tectonic faultsGeberman S., Zhidkov M., Rantsman E.Seismicaly Active Latitudes and Transverse Morphostructural Lineaments of the Ands Mountain Belt. Vycheslitel'naya Seismologia, v. 16, 1984.. It was also found that in the morphostructural knots happens most accidents on oil, gas, and water pipelines, and railroad railsRantsman E., Glasko M.

Kandel E. I. Kandel. Functional and Stereotactic Neurosurgery, Springer, 1989(one of the pioneers in surgical treatment of hemorrhagic strokes) turned to the outstanding mathematician Prof. I.Gelfand for help in comparing the effectiveness of these two treatments. Guberman was chosen as the main architect of the project. First, it was decided changing the goal: instead of choosing the best treatment in general finding the best treatment for a particular patient – conservative or operational (“treat the patient not the disease”). For this it was decided to use the pattern recognition technology developed in the past for geology (see above). Two decision rules have to be developed: 1) for predicting the outcome (life or death) of the conservative treatment of the particular patient, 2) for predicting the outcome (life or death) of the surgery of the same patient. The decisions are based on neurological and general symptoms collected at the first 12 hours after the patient arrived in the hospital. The obtained decision rules were preliminary tested for two years: the collected data were send to the computer, and the two prognoses (forecasted outcomes of the operation and the conservative treatment) were placed in the patient’s file. A month later the computer predictions were compared with the outcomes. The overall result – 90% correct predictions. Then followed the clinical implementation: the computer decisions were immediately sent to the surgeon on duty who makes the final decision. In five years 90 patients received computer forecastsGelfand et al. Mathematical prediction of hemorrhagic stroke outcomes to establish indications for surgical treatment.

For 5 patients the computer warning was neglected (for different reasons), and all 5 died. In 5 cases it was strongly recommended avoiding operation. 3 of them were treated accordingly and survive, 2 of them were operated contrary to the computer advice and died.

In animal sibling rivalry, individuals compete for parental care or limited resources, which can sometimes result in siblicide.Krebs, J. R., and N. B. Davies. An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1993. Print. Sibling rivalry occurs in many different forms. Siblings may compete for resources in a prenatal and/or post-birth environment. The degree of rivalry varies, ranging from a low level of violence in non-aggressive to the killing of kin in siblicide.  Function of behavior  Blue-footed booby nesting with multiple eggs. If more than one egg hatches successfully, the chicks may compete with each other for food and attention from parents. When there are multiple offspring in a single brood, the potential for sibling rivalry arises due to competition for food and parental attention. Natural selection may favor behaviors that allow an individual offspring to gain more resources, even if the behavior decreases a sibling's fitness. Competition for food and resources can be seen in many bird species. For example, blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) siblings often exhibit aggression towards each other, with older chicks pecking at younger chicks. This behavior increases when there are food shortages, indicating more intense competition.Drummond, Hugh and Cecilia Garcia Chavelas. \\"Food Shortage Influences Sibling Aggression in the Blue- Footed Booby.\\" Animal Behaviour 37.5 (1989): 806-19. Print. In other bird species, siblings compete for food through manipulation of parental behavior rather than direct aggressive acts. Increased parental attention may mean more food for the offspring, favoring the development of begging behavior in nestlings. American robin (Turdus migratorius) chicks compete for food provided by their parents through louder and more prominent cheeps or other vocalizations, with the most food given to chicks exhibiting the most intense begging behavior.Smith, Henrik G., and Robert Montgomerie. \\"Nestling American Robins Compete with Siblings by Begging.\\" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 29.4 (1991): 307-12. Print. Sibling rivalry may not seem to align with the kin selection theory, which predicts that altruistic behaviors may evolve if inclusive fitness benefits (including those of relatives) from such behaviors outweigh the costs.Smith, J. Maynard. \\"Group selection and kin selection.\\" Nature 201 (1964): 1145-1147. Theoretically, helping relatives would allow individuals to spread genes related to their own. However, some species may show sibling rivalry when the fitness costs outweigh the benefits of helping relatives. Sibling relatedness can influence degree of rivalry. Canary nestlings are more selfish and competitive if other nestlings are less related.Kilner, R.M. “Mouth colour is a reliable signal of need in begging canary nestlings.” Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 264 (1997): 779-804. Print When offspring beg for more food from their parents, they also are “competing” with their future siblings by decreasing the fitness of parents, reducing their ability to invest in future offspring. This is known as interbrood rivalry, which can lead to parent–offspring conflict.  Siblicide  Siblicide is a consequence of sibling rivalry, and its occurrence may be due to a variety of factors, such as food shortages and limited parental care. Killing a sibling could be advantageous for an animal because it monopolizes more resources through the elimination of a competitor. Moreover, there are different types of siblicide. For example, obligate siblicide is the unconditional killing of a sibling. In species of birds that exhibit this behavior, the larger chick commits the act of siblicide. On the other hand, facultative siblicide refers to situations in which the death of a sibling does not always occur, but is usually motivated by environmental factors such as limited resources.Anderson, David J. \\"Evolution of Obligate Siblicide in Boobies. 1. A Test of the Insurance-Egg Hypothesis.\\" The American Naturalist 135.3 (1990): 334. Web. Facultative siblicide is exhibited by the previously discussed case of the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). In this species, senior chicks may sometimes eliminate siblings when there are food shortages. During these shortages, chicks exhibit higher levels of pecking, but this aggression decreases when food levels are brought back to sufficient levels.Anderson, David J.; “Evolution of obligate siblicide in boobies: A test of the insurance egg hypothesis”; The American Naturalist, Vol. 135, No. 3 (March 1990); pp. 334-350. In some species, parents have evolved behaviors to take advantage of siblicide to increase their own fitness. For example, the laughing gull exhibits asynchronous hatching patterns in order to cut parental losses. In this species, birds that lay their eggs at different times produce, on average, a larger number of fledglings per nest in comparison to birds with synchronous hatches.Hahn, D. Caldwell. \\"Asynchronous Hatching in the Laughing Gull: Cutting Losses and Reducing Rivalry.\\" Animal Behaviour 29.2 (1981): 421-27. Print. Staggered hatching creates chicks in different stages of growth. Older, and thus larger, chicks kill their younger siblings, reducing brood size and allowing the parent to concentrate efforts when food is scarce. Once the brood is reduced, sibling rivalry decreases because there are fewer competitors, benefitting the surviving offspring. This also benefits the parents by minimizing unproductive parental investment in offspring that are unlikely to be successful. This is especially advantageous during food shortages when parents are unable to adequately feed all offspring. = Spotted hyena sibling aggression = Spotted hyenas interacting aggressively. Siblicide in this species is facultative, and it is triggered when competition increases due to limited resources. Siblicide has also been noted in mammalian species. For instance, spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) have been known to exhibit facultative siblicidal behavior. Intense sibling aggression begins only a few minutes after birth and then continues for a few days.Frank, Laurence G., Stephen E. Glickman, and Paul Light. \\"Fatal sibling aggression, precocial development, and androgens in neonatal spotted hyenas.\\" Science 252.5006 (1991). Web. The function of sibling aggression is to establish and maintain rank relationship between litter mates, but this aggression does not always lead to sibling death.Wahaj, Sofia and K.E. Holekamp. \\"Functions of sibling aggression in the spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta.” Animal Behaviour 71.6 (2006): 1401-1409. Print. However, during periods of intense feeding competition, aggression can escalate to siblicide.Wahaj, Sofia A.,Ned J. Place, Mary L. Weldele, Stephen E. Glickman and Kay E. Holekamp. \\"Siblicide in the Spotted Hyena: Analysis with Ultrasonic Examination of Wild and Captive Individuals.\\" Behavioral Ecology 18.6 (2007): 974-984. Web. Spotted hyena aggression demonstrates how facultative siblicide can be triggered by environmental factors. = Intrauterine cannibalism = Intrauterine cannibalism (see also: cannibalism) occurs when siblings eat each other in the embryonic phase. This can take the form of embryophagy when siblings eat embryos, and oophagy, when siblings eat eggs.Clutton-Brock, Tim H. The evolution of parental care. Princeton University Press, 1991 Intrauterine cannibalism can benefit embryos by providing increased nutrition. Fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) populations exhibiting intrauterine cannibalism have embryos that develop more quickly into larvae due to nutritional supplementation from feeding on siblings.Buckley, David, Marina Alcobendas, Mario García-París, and Marvalee H. Wake. \\"Heterochrony, cannibalism, and the evolution of viviparity in Salamandra salamandra.\\" Evolution & Development 9.1 (2007): 105-115. Lamnoid shark embryos have adaptations to facilitate intrauterine cannibalism in the form of precocious teeth, which they use to feed on intrauterine eggs and siblings after their yolk supply is used up.Hamlett, William C., Allison M. Eulitt, Robert L. Jarrell, and Matthew Kelly. \\"Uterogestation and Placentation in Elasmobranchs.\\" Journal of Experimental Zoology 266.5 (1993): 347-67. Print. In sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus), the first embryo to reach a certain size, referred to as \\"the hatchling,\\" will always consume the smaller, less- developed siblings in the womb.Chapman, Demian D., Sabine P. Wintner, Debra L. Abercrombie, Jimiane Ashe, Andrea M. Bernard, Mahmood S. Shivji, and Kevin A. Feldheim. \\"The Behavioural and Genetic Mating System of the Sand Tiger Shark, Carcharias Taurus, an Intrauterine Cannibal.\\" Biology Letters 9.3 (2013). Print. Because the first embryo may have a different father from the eaten embryos, this form of siblicide early during development may be indirectly involved in male competition. This phenomenon of embryonic cannibalism may play a role in sexual selection, as males compete post-fertilization for paternity.Chapman, Demian D., Sabine P. Wintner, Debra L. Abercrombie, Jimiane Ashe, Andrea M. Bernard, Mahmood S. Shivji, and Kevin A. Feldheim. \\"The Behavioural and Genetic Mating System of the Sand Tiger Shark, Carcharias Taurus, an Intrauterine Cannibal.\\" Biology Letters 9.3 (2013). Print. Thus, intrauterine cannibalism in sharks may reflect not only sibling rivalry, but also male competition for successful mating with females, which is an example of sexual selection. Non-lethal competition Not all forms of sibling rivalry in animals involve direct aggression or death of a sibling. This is not an extremely aggressive form of rivalry; however, it still results in reduced sibling fitness. Suckling piglets often exhibit strong competition for access to their mother's teats through armed sibling rivalry. = Fetal programming in sheep = Fetal programming (see also: Barker’s Hypothesis) refers to the persisting effects in adult life caused by the fetal environment. In sheep, competition for resources within the uterus may lead to impaired reproductive abilities and different body composition. Sheep that were born 600 grams lighter than their twins have an impaired reproductive ability - the lighter the sheep weighed in comparison to their twin, the more impaired. Although the sheep are not competing physically like in intrauterine cannibalism, the disparity in birth weight suggests an overall fitness difference.Casellas, J., and G. Caja. \\"Fetal Programming by Co-Twin Rivalry in Sheep.\\" Journal of Animal Science 92.1 (2014): 64-71. Print. = Sibling rivalry among suckling piglets = Domestic piglets (Sus scrofa) have been shown to exhibit different forms of non-lethal competition such as uterine competition. The relative development of the embryo in the uterus can affect their chance of survival. Pig embryos follow different developmental paths because during estrus, sows will ovulate the majority of their follicles during a short period of time and then a few during a longer period of time.Pope W.F., S. Xie, D.M. Broermann, and K.P. Nephew. “Causes and consequences of early embryonic diversity in pigs”. Journal of Reproduction and Fertility (Suppl) 40:251–260. Print. This pattern causes a difference in development, so the less developed embryos are less likely to survive. Competition also exists over space in the uterus of the sow. The central portion of the uterus is the most crowded and the site of the greatest competition. This competition prevents some embryos from fully growing, often resulting in a low birthweight that may put piglets at a disadvantage once out of the womb.Pope W.F., S. Xie, D.M. Broermann, and K.P. Nephew. “Causes and consequences of early embryonic diversity in pigs”. Journal of Reproduction and Fertility (Suppl) 40:251–260. Print. Neonatal competition also exists among piglets as they directly compete against their siblings for their mother’s teats only hours after their birth.Hartsock T.G., and H.B. Graves. “Neonatal behavioral and nutrition-related mortality in domestic swine.” Journal of Animal Science 42 (1976): 235-41. Print. Competition is responsible for 43% of piglet neonatal death due to starvation. Under normal conditions (i.e. stable environment, average litter size), larger piglets appear to have an advantage in survival partially due to their ability to win more fights against smaller piglets over access to teats.Drake, Anna, David Fraser, and Daniel M. Weary. \\"Parent-Offspring Resource Allocation in Domestic Pigs.\\" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 62.3 (2008): 309-19. Print. It is believed that teeth in piglets evolved as a product of an evolutionary arms race caused by sibling competition, resulting in armed sibling rivalry. Teeth become more important when the litter size is larger than normal, causing increased competition. In these situations, the teeth can help the individual piglet compete against siblings.Fraser, David, and B. K. Thompson. \\"Armed Sibling Rivalry among Suckling Piglets.\\" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 29.1 (1991): 9-15. Print.  Role of the parent and interbrood conflict  Great tit chicks beg for food from their parents, but their proximity to parents often determines amount of feeding. As a result, chicks compete for optimal feeding location within the nest. Sibling rivalry can be mediated and/or encouraged by parents, especially in bird species. Sibling rivalry can also have a negative impact on the parent and the fitness of future offspring due to interbrood conflict which may lead to parent–offspring conflict. This conflict may force parents to exert extra energy at the expense of future broods. Parents may play a passive role in encouraging sibling rivalry. The most common case is in food distribution. When parent birds distribute food, they do not favor any individual offspring. Great tits (Parus major) preferentially distribute food from similar locations, so offspring compete for those prime spots closest to the feeding site where they will get more food, leading to unequal growth of offspring. This behavior exemplified in the young can be interpreted as an optimal foraging strategy driven by scramble competition.Kolliker, M., Richner, H. “Navigation in a cup: chick positioning in great tit, Parus major, nests.” Animal Behavior, 68 (2004), 941-948. Alternatively, parents may take an active role in mediating the intensity of rivalry between siblings. Again, great tit parents can choose what location to distribute food to as a means of controlling competition between nestlings. When parents feed chicks at one or two feeding locations in the nest, the distance between the male and female parents influences the level of competition between nestlings. In other words, parents may decrease sibling competition by varying the locations within the nest that receive food. Interbrood conflict occurs when the current brood demands more at the expense of future broods. This sibling rivalry can lead to parent–offspring conflict, in which there are different optimal levels of parental investments whether viewed from the parental or offspring perspective. Biological signalling theory suggests that young can communicate with parents to maximize the amount of food they can get. Therefore, young that need or want more food may solicit or beg at higher levels. Parents can respond to this by providing more food, but this is based on the assumption of honest begging, in which chicks beg only when they actually need more food. However, if all the young start soliciting at higher levels, this incurs a cost on the parents because they will need to expend more energy searching for food. The increased travel to and from the nest may attract predators as well. These factors reduce the energy and resources parents have for future offspring. This is an example of where nestling intrabrood competition can influence the parents' investment in future broods.Godfray, H. C.

History Ellen Leggett developed implicit theories of intelligence in 1985. Her paper \\"Children's entity and incremental theories of intelligence: Relationships to achievement behavior\\" was presented at the 1985 meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association in Boston. As a result, Dweck and her collaborators began studying how individuals unknowingly (or implicitly) assess their own intelligence and abilities through interaction and interpretation of their environment. It was assumed that these assessments ultimately influenced the individual's goals, motivations, behaviors, and self-esteem. The researchers began by looking at students who were highly motivated to achieve, and students who were not, though the levels of self- achievement were not clarified. They noticed that the highly motivated students thrived in the face of challenge while the other students quit or withdrew from their work, but critically, a student's raw intelligence did not predict whether a student was highly motivated or not. Rather, they discovered that these two groups of students held different beliefs (or implicit theories) about intelligence, categorized as entity or incremental theories, which affected their classroom performance. Entity theory vs. incremental theory Carol Dweck identified two different mindsets regarding intelligence beliefs. The entity theory of intelligence refers to an individual's belief that intelligence and ability are fixed traits. For entity theorists, if perceived ability to perform a task is high, the perceived possibility for mastery is also high. In turn, if perceived ability is low, there is little perceived possibility of mastery, often regarded as an outlook of \\"learned helplessness\\" (Park & Kim, 2015). However, the incremental theory of intelligence proposes that intelligence and ability are malleable traits which can be improved upon through effort and hard work. For incremental theorists, there is a perceived possibility of mastery even when initial ability to perform a task is low. Those who subscribe to this theory of intelligence \\"don't necessarily believe that anyone can become an Einstein or Mozart, but they do understand even Einstein and Mozart had to put in years of effort to become who they were\\". This possibility of mastery contributes in part to intrinsic motivation of individuals to perform a task, since there is perceived potential for success in the task. Individuals may fall on some spectrum between the two types of theories, and their views may change given different situations and training. By observing an individual's motivation and behavior towards achievement, an individual's general mindset regarding intelligence is revealed. About 40% of the general population believe the entity theory, 40% believe the incremental theory, and 20% do not fit well into either category.Elliot, A., & Dweck, C. S. (2005). The handbook of competence and motivation. New York: Guilford. Performance level on a task is not always predetermined by an individual's mindset. Previous research on the subject has shown that when faced with failure on an initial task, those with an entity theory mindset will perform worse on subsequent tasks that measure the same ability than those with an incremental theory mindset (Park & Kim, 2015). However, a 2015 research study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin found that when the subsequent task measured a different ability, entity theorists performed better than incremental theorists. In certain situations, the incremental theorists studied were self-critical about the previous failure; these thoughts disrupted their performance on the subsequent task. Incremental theorists' reactions to failure are traditionally seen as an \\"adaptive response\\", meaning they link the failure to insufficient effort and therefore search for ways to improve their performance. If there is no opportunity for improvement on the task, such as in the research study, thoughts of doubt about the failure affect future performance (Park & Kim, 2015). For the individuals who believed in an entity theory of intelligence, there were no such feelings of doubt when performing the second task because they perceived the task as not measuring the ability that they lacked on the initial task. After the first failure, self-critical thoughts are less likely to linger in their minds while performing the second task; the study points out that \\"entity theorists will not necessarily feel helpless because the second task does not measure the ability they think they lack\\" (Park & Kim 2015). Therefore, in this study, entity theorists performed better on the subsequent task than did incremental theorists if the measured ability was different. Motivation toward achievement =Different types of goals= An individual's motivation towards achievement is shaped by their implicit theory of intelligence (and their related implicit theories about domain-specific aptitudes) and its associated goals. J.G. Nicholls proposed two different types of goals related to achievement. Task involvement goals involve individuals aiming to improve their own abilities. Ego involvement goals involve individuals wanting to better themselves compared to others. Dweck modified Nicholls' ideas by proposing performance goals and mastery goals. Performance goals are associated with entity theory and lead individuals to perform actions in order to appear capable and avoid negative judgments about their skills. Mastery goals are associated with incremental theory and lead individuals to engage and work in order to gain expertise in new things.Dweck, C.S., & Elliott, E.S. (1983). Achievement motivation. In P. Mussen and E.M. Hetherington (Eds.), Handbook of child psychology. New York: Wiley. =Response to challenge= Individuals who believe they have the ability to grow and add to their knowledge gladly accept challenges that can aid in growth towards mastery. Individuals who believe their abilities are fixed will also accept and persist through challenges as long as they feel they will succeed and their abilities will not be questioned. However, when these individuals lack confidence in their abilities, they will avoid, procrastinate, or possibly cheat in challenging situations that might make them appear incompetent. These behaviors can lead to a sense of learned helplessness and stymied intellectual growth. =Attribution of failure= Attribution of failure and coping with that failure are highly related to mindset. Individuals who subscribe to an incremental view will attribute a failure to not yet having learned something, looking at something from the incorrect perspective, or not working hard enough. All of these problems can be corrected through effort, leading incrementalist individuals to continually seek any situation that will intellectually better themselves. Also they are more likely to engage in remedial action to correct mistakes if necessary. Those with fixed intelligence views attribute failure to their own lack of ability. =Self-regulated learning= Individuals with an incremental mindset will take feedback and channel that into determination to try new strategies for solving a given problem, a large part of self-regulated learning (or learning to effectively guide your own studies). As a result, incrementalist individuals are more effective at self-regulated learning, ultimately leading them to be more productive at developing plans for learning and making connections between topics which promotes deeper processing of information.Dweck, C.S., & Master, A. (2008). Self-theories motivate self- regulated learning. In D. Schunk & B. Zimmerman (Eds). Motivation and self- regulated learning: Theory, Research, and Applications. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Self-esteem Incrementalist individuals generally have positive and stable self-esteem and do not question their intelligence in the face of failure, instead remaining eager and curious.Dweck, C.S. (1999). Self-Theories: Their role in motivation, personality and development. Philadelphia: Taylor and Francis/Psychology Press. Individuals with entity beliefs mostly attribute failure or having to exert effort to a lack of ability. Therefore, if they do not succeed at some task, they are unlikely to seek similar tasks or will quit trying. They believe that putting in effort will undermine their competence because if they were smart enough to begin with, they would not need to put in effort. These individuals will limit themselves to situations where they believe they will succeed and may limit themselves in the face of negative feedback, which they will likely interpret as a personal attack on their ability. These individuals' self-esteem as well as their enjoyment of a task may suffer when they encounter failure and the associated feelings of helplessness. Many children who see failure as a reflection of their intelligence will even lie about their scores to strangers to preserve their self-esteem and competence, since they connect their judgments of self to their performance. Students who see the value of effort do not show such a tendency. The majority of what are considered \\"best students\\" are often concerned with failure.Leggett, E. L. (1985, March). Children's entity and incremental theories of intelligence: Relationships to achievement behavior. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association, Boston Students who achieve a great deal of academic success early on might be most likely to believe their intelligence is fixed because they so frequently have been praised regarding their intelligence. They may have faced fewer opportunities for setbacks and do not have much experience persisting through errors. Longitudinal research shows that individuals who endorse entity beliefs experience decreasing self-esteem throughout their college years, while individuals who endorse incremental beliefs experience an increase. Development Implicit theories of intelligence develop at an early age and are subtly influenced by parents and educators and the type of praise they give for successful work. Typically it has been assumed that any sort of praise will have a positive impact on a child's self-confidence and achievement. However, different types of praise can lead to the development of different views on intelligence. Young children who hear praise that values high intelligence as a measure of success, such as \\"You must be smart at these problems,\\" may link failure with a lack of intelligence and are more susceptible to developing an entity mindset. Often children are given high praise for their intelligence after relatively easy success, which sets them up to develop counterproductive behaviors in dealing with academic setbacks, rather than fostering confidence and the enjoyment of learning. Praise for intelligence connects performance with ability, rather than effort, leading these individuals to develop \\"performance\\" goals to prove competence. However students who receive praise valuing hard work as a measure of success, such as \\"You must have worked hard at these problems,\\" more often pursue mastery goals that underlie an incremental mindset. Subtle differences in speech to children that promote non-generic praise (i.e. \\"You did a good job drawing\\") versus generic praise (i.e. \\"You are a good drawer\\"), lead children to respond to later criticism in a way that demonstrates an incremental mindset. Shifting from entity to incremental mindset to improve achievement Understanding differences between those who believe in entity theory versus incremental theory allows educators to predict how students will persevere in a classroom. Then, educators can change behaviors that may contribute to academic shortcomings for those with entity tendencies and low confidence in their abilities. While these implicit beliefs regarding where intelligence comes from are relatively stable across time and permeate all aspects of behavior, it is possible to change peoples' perspectives on their abilities for a given task with the right priming. Dweck's 2006 book Mindset: How You Can Fill Your Potential focuses on teaching individuals how they can encourage thinking with a growth mindset for a happier and more successful existence.Dweck, C.S. (2006). Mindset. New York: Random House - Be Positive To All Your Problems =Elementary-aged students= Given the opportunity for fifth graders to choose their own learning tasks, when primed towards gaining skills, they will pick challenging tasks. When they are primed towards assessment, they will pick tasks that they think they will be successful at to show off their abilities. Thus, they will forgo new learning if it means the possibility of making mistakes. If the situation is framed in a manner that emphasizes learning and process rather than success, mindset can be altered. =Middle school-aged children= Transitioning between elementary school and middle school is a time when many students with an entity theory of intelligence begin to experience their first taste of academic difficulty. Transitioning students with low abilities can be oriented to a growth mentality when taught that their brains are like muscles that get stronger through hard work and effort. This lesson can result in a marked improvement in grades compared to students with similar abilities and resources available to them who do not receive this information on the brain. =College-aged students= One consequence for individuals experiencing the stereotype threat (or worrying about conforming to a negative stereotype associated with a member of one's group) is that they will also experience an entity mindset. College students are able to overcome this negative impact after participating in an incremental thinking intervention, afterwards reporting higher levels of happiness according to the theory. Predictive power of knowing an individual's theory =Success in school and on tests= An individual's implicit theory of intelligence can predict future success, particularly navigating life transitions that are often associated with challenging situations, such as moving from elementary to middle school. Students followed throughout their middle school careers showed that those who possessed growth mindset tendencies made better grades and had a more positive view on the role of effort than students who possessed fixed mindset tendencies with similar abilities, two years following the initial survey. Those with theoretical entity beliefs worry more about tests even in situations where they have experienced some success, spend less time practicing before tests, and thus have shown reduced performance on IQ tests relative to others in their environment. If the situation is framed in a manner that emphasizes learning and process rather than success, mindset can be altered. Individuals with fixed mindsets may engage in less practice in order to allow themselves an excuse besides low ability for potentially poor performance in order to preserve their egos. Students who have learning goals (associated with incremental beliefs) are more internally motivated and successful in the face of a challenging college course. After the first test in a course, those who possess learning goals are likely to improve their grades on the next test whereas those with performance goals did not. =Negotiation skills= Incrementalist individuals tend to have stronger negotiating skills, believing that with effort a better deal can be reached. This finding may have implications for more favorable working conditions for those with incrementalist beliefs. =\\"Easily learned = easily remembered\\" heuristic= According to theory, individuals who believe their intelligence can grow think about information in their world differently even outside of academic challenges, seen by use of a different heuristic when making judgments of learning (JOLs), or estimates of learning. Those with entity views are generally guided by the principle \\"easily learned\\" means \\"easily remembered,\\" which means that when learning information, these individuals will make low JOLs when a task is difficult. Those with incremental views did not follow this \\"easily learned\\" means \\"easily remembered\\" principle and gave higher judgments to more difficult tasks, perhaps believing that if more effort is put into the learning because it is harder, those items will be better remembered. Other behaviors governed by implicit theories Research into implicit theories of intelligence has led to additional discoveries expanding the idea of entity vs incremental mindset to other areas outside of just intelligence. Views about intelligence are just a single manifestation of a more general entity or incremental mindset which reveals a great deal about a person's view of the world and self. Generally those with entity views will see all characteristics, in addition to intelligence, as innate and static while those with incremental views see characteristics as malleable. Entity beliefs lead to more stereotyping, greater rigidity in prejudiced beliefs, and difficulties during conflict resolution. Incremental views are connected to more open beliefs and amenability during conflict resolutions.Dweck, C.S. & Ehrlinger, J. (2006). Implicit theories and conflict resolution. In M. Deutsch & P.T. Coleman (Eds.), Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice, (pp. 317-330). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. In intimate relationships, those who possess an incremental mindset tend to believe that people can change and exhibit more forgiveness than those with entity mindsets. Similarly, those with entity beliefs are likely to endorse the fundamental attribution error more than those with incremental views, who tend to focus much more on the situation than internal characteristics of an individual.Dweck, C.S. (2011). Implicit theories. In P. Van Lange, A. Kruglanski, & T. Higgins, Eds. (Eds.), The Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.

It was designed by Benjamin Backhouse and built from 1865 to 1959. It is also known as St Francis Theological College and Bishopsbourne. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Old Bishopsbourne This two-storeyed stone residence was constructed in 1865-68 for Edward Tufnell, the first Anglican Bishop of Brisbane (1860–74), as his See house. It remained the home of the Anglican primates of Brisbane until 1964. In 1862 Tufnell, on behalf of the Anglican Church, received from Emmeline Leslie a gift of of eucalypt woodland along the Milton Road. The site was earmarked for a See house. During a short sojourn in England, Tufnell raised for the Brisbane Diocese. Despite popular opposition to the expense, of this was spent constructing Bishopsbourne. The architect was Benjamin Backhouse, who had practised in Geelong, Ballarat and London, before arriving in Brisbane in 1861. Backhouse left Brisbane for Sydney in 1868, but in the short time he was resident in Queensland, his work was prolific, ranging from houses to churches to school to hotels to commercial and warehouse premises. Among these works were a number of substantial Brisbane residences – such as: * Cintra House at Bowen Hills in 1863-64 * Fernberg at Bardon * Baroona at Rosalie in 1866 and several ecclesiastic buildings, including: * the first All Saints Anglican Church on Wickham Terrace, erected in 1861-62 * St Stephen's School and convent in 1862 * St Mary's Convent at Ipswich in 1863-63 * the second St Stephen's Cathedral, commenced in 1863-64 * the first St Mary's Catholic Church at Warwick, erected 1863-65 In the mid-1860s he designed National Schools at Toowoomba, Warwick, Condamine, Laidley, Goondiwindi, Nanango, Bald Hills, Bowen, Maryborough and Fortitude Valley for the Queensland Board of Education. He also designed the first Brisbane Grammar School in Roma Street, constructed 1868-69. During construction of the residence, much of the indigenous woodland was cleared. Remnants of survive, but most of the eucalypts are secondary growth. Garden beds for flowers, vegetables and fruit were established in the 1870s. Hoop and Bunya pines, staghorns and elkhorns were introduced at this period as well. Pencil pines were planted after 1912. In the 1870s, porphyry and sandstone gateposts were erected on Milton Road, defining the entrance to the carriage approach to the See house. A timber chapel designed by diocesan architect Richard George Suter was constructed in the grounds , but was replaced in 1912 by the current stone building (Old Bishopsbourne Chapel). In 1886 Brisbane architects Banks and Carandini designed a two-storeyed brick and stone kitchen/service wing to replace an earlier wooden structure. During the 1930s a number of significant changes were made to the grounds of Bishopsbourne. Land fronting Milton and Baroona Roads and Heussler Terrace was subdivided and sold, reducing the area to . Stone terraces along the eastern and western slopes were constructed, using relief labour. These were planted with shrubs, annuals and a bougainvillea hedge, but have been largely grassed over since. In 1936 St Francis' Theological College was transferred from Nundah to the grounds of Bishopsbourne, where a wooden dormitory and classroom building was constructed. Two brick and concrete structures were erected for the College in 1959, one being the vice-principal's residence and the other an award-winning library. Some restoration work at Bishopsbourne was undertaken in 1962, particularly of the cedar joinery. However, in 1964 Archbishop Philip Strong moved to Eldernell (formerly Farsley) at 39 Eldernell Terrace, Hamilton, which became the new Bishopsbourne, and the former See house at Milton became part of St Francis' Theological College. The 1860s core was refurbished as the principal's residence, and the 1880s service wing was converted into quarters for the vice-principal. During the 1980s, pressure for increased student accommodation resulted in the construction of a number of two-storeyed, brick, semi-detached townhouses in the grounds of St Francis' Theological College. A new timber administration building and a set of timber townhouses were constructed in the early 1990s. In April 2007, Archbishop Phillip Aspinall sold the Hamilton Bishopsbourne for $11.2 million and moved to a residence in Ascot costing $2.6 million, which has also been renamed Bishopsbourne.  Description  Old Bishopsbourne is a large, two-storeyed residence constructed of local porphyry and sandstone. The style is a blend of derived and vernacular elements. On both floors, French casement windows with fanlights open from the main rooms onto wide verandahs, which are enclosed externally by Gothic stone arches, creating a cloistered atmosphere. The second storey verandah balustrade is constructed of cast iron fashioned in an inverted arch pattern. The hipped roof is slated with four tall chimney- stacks. Small louvred gablets ventilate the roof. Internally the sandstock brickwork is cement rendered and lime plastered, with little ornamentation. All the internal joinery, including high folding doors which retract into the walls, is of Queensland red cedar. The ground floor comprises a small vestibule separated by a cedar and etched glass screen from a broad hallway running the length of the house; three rooms to the right used for drawing room and study functions; three rooms to the left which open to one large dining area; an enclosed section of the front verandah which now contains a bathroom; and a modern kitchen at the rear. The upstairs has been converted into the principal's quarters, containing six bedrooms, two bathrooms, a lounge and a kitchen. A two-storeyed brick and stone annexe with a corrugated iron roof, formerly the service wing, is attached at the rear. The iron balustrade pattern of the main building is repeated around the annexe verandahs, the lower level of which incorporates a deep timber valance. Underneath both the main building and the annexe are large cellars, intended originally as larders and storage space. While an ongoing building programme has resulted in substantial changes to the site, sufficient grounds and mature trees remain to sustain the garden setting ambience, and the residence itself remains largely intact. The 1870s gateposts survive, but only fragments of the early garden beds. The 1930s stone terracing survives. Other significant buildings within the grounds include: * Old Bishopsbourne Chapel (1912), a Gothic style, gable-roofed stone building * the 1936 St Francis' Theological College Building, a gable-roofed and verandahed, interwar hostel-type timber building * St Francis' Theological College Library Building (1959), a postwar International style brick, concrete and glass structure with ecclesiastical undertones. The endeavours by successive architects to incorporate gable and arch motifs within their contemporary designs has created a sense of harmony within the grounds.  Heritage listing  Old Bishopsbourne was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Old Bishopsbourne (St Francis Theological College) and its substantial grounds, which include early garden fragments, early gateposts, a 1912 Robin Dods designed stone chapel, 1930s terracing and a number of buildings associated with St Francis Theological College (from 1936), is significant historically as one of the oldest ecclesiastical precincts in Queensland. Old Bishopsbourne, a purpose-designed See house constructed 1865-68, is significant historically for its strong association with the mid-19th century consolidation of the Anglican Church in Queensland, and with the Anglican Bishops and Archbishops of Brisbane for nearly a century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Old Bishopsbourne is an accomplished and aesthetically appealing building with a simplicity of design and austerity of decoration which reflect its function and purpose as an ecclesiastical residence. It is important as a major work by prominent architect Benjamin Backhouse, and one of the more intact of his surviving Brisbane works. The 1936 theological college accommodation and lecture room building is a good example of interwar hostel-type accommodation, and the award-winning 1959 college library building is a fine example of International style in Brisbane. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Old Bishopsbourne is a Milton landmark, still visible in the western vista from Petrie Terrace. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The 1936 theological college accommodation and lecture room building is a good example of interwar hostel-type accommodation, and the award-winning 1959 college library building is a fine example of International style in Brisbane. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has had a strong association with the work of the Anglican Church in Queensland for over 130 years, and each of the buildings in the grounds illustrates further consolidation of the Anglican church in this state.

Forrester III (born July 13, 1937) is an American cardiologist. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he received his medical training at the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, and Harvard University. During the 1970s through 1990s, his research led to three major advancements in the practice of cardiology. Later in his career, he would return to UCLA, this time as a professor, while simultaneously being the Chief of the Division of Cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Forrester has published hundreds of papers and manuscripts dealing with the subject of cardiology, and is the recipient of numerous awards, including being the second person to ever receive the Lifetime Achievement Award of the American College of Cardiology in 2009. Early life and career His secondary school education was in the small central Pennsylvania town of Camp Hill, where his father was a doctor. He received his bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College in 1959, and his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1963. Following internship at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and internal medical residency at UCLA-Harbor Medical Center, he completed his cardiology fellowship at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital. In the late 1960s he was appointed Director of Cardiovascular Research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Career 1970s–1990s Forrester directed a multimillion- dollar National Institute of Health research program called a Specialized Center of Research in Ischemic Heart Disease at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. During this 20-year period Cedars-Sinai cardiology was ranked first in the western United States by U.S. News and World Report, a position which it continues to hold through the present day. Forrester's research led to three advances that altered the practice of cardiology. In the 1970s, he directed the development of hemodynamic monitoring at the bedside, using a balloon- tipped catheter he maneuvered through the heart. He used these measurements to create a method of care for patients with acute myocardial infarction that became known as the Forrester hemodynamic subsets. Hemodynamic monitoring allowed doctors to repeatedly measure the effect of drugs on the function of the heart at the bedside, and revolutionized the care of critically ill patients. The second advance came in the early 1980s, when Forrester and George Diamond created the field of probability analysis for coronary heart disease, which became known as the Diamond-Forrester method for interpreting diagnostic tests. Their approach integrated a patient's pre-test likelihood of having disease with the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test to calculate a patient's post-test likelihood of disease. The method is now used worldwide in cardiology. The third major advance to which Forrester contributed came in the early 1990s: Forrester led a team that developed coronary angioscopy, a method for seeing inside a living patient's coronary arteries using a thin flexible fiberoptic catheter. His team discovered the presence of small, partially occlusive blood clots in patients with unstable angina (now called acute coronary syndrome), leading to the modern implementation of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in this condition. Later career In later years Forrester became Professor of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine, the George Burns and Gracie Allen Professor of Cardiovascular Research, and Chief of the Division of Cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. In these roles, he served as mentor for several hundred cardiologists, a number of whom are currently leaders in cardiovascular medicine. Forrester has published over 400 full-length scientific manuscripts and book chapters dealing with these topics. In 2009, he was the second-ever recipient of the American College of Cardiology’s highest honor, the Lifetime Achievement Award.{} Additional honors include Cable News Network's 10 Medical Scientists to Watch (1989), the Leon Goodman Award for excellence in laser research, the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award of the American Heart Association in Los Angeles, the Jan Kellerman Award for research in preventive cardiology, and the 2011 Simon Dack Award for Outstanding Scholarship from the Journal of American College of Cardiology.{} The following year he was the annual awardee for the Camp Hill High School Wall of Honor. In 2013 he received the annual Pioneer of Medicine Award from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. At the award ceremony, his colleagues created a 10-minute video describing his career and his contributions to their own careers. In 2014 he was chosen to deliver the lecture celebrating the American College of Cardiology's 65th Anniversary.{} In 1949-2014: 65 Years of Cardiovascular History, he described the people and events that changed the care of heart disease in his lifetime. He is the author of The Heart Healers: The Misfits, Mavericks, and Rebels Who Created the Greatest Medical Breakthrough of Our Lives, published in September, 2015 by St. Martin's Press. The book, which appeared as an Amazon best seller in its category, is a historical memoir of his personal relationships with the pioneers who created heart surgery, defibrillators, pacemakers, coronary care units, heart imaging, and angioplasty, and tells stories about the emotional impact of these lifesaving advances on his individual patients. In 2019 he received the annual Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Lifetime Achievement Award.

He became the progenitor of the prominent Kiszka family. He was sent on frequent diplomatic missions to the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Kingdom of Poland. He attempted to negotiate peace during the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars and supported a closer union between Poland and Lithuania. During the Second Muscovite–Lithuanian War (1500–03), he successfully defended Smolensk and became Great Hetman (commander of the army) until Konstanty Ostrogski escaped Russian captivity in 1507. Kiszka helped to subdue the Glinski rebellion in 1508. Shortly before his death, Kiszka also became Grand Marshal of Lithuania. Biography Kiszka's father Piotr Strumiłło died in 1486 and he inherited his positions. Kiszka started his political career as a stolnik (royal pantler) and starosta of Lida in 1488. His further career was related to the favor of Alexander Jagiellon who became Grand Duke in 1492 and marriage to the daughter of Petras Jonaitis Mangirdaitis and the last heiress of the influential Mantigirdai family. During his first years, Grand Duke Alexander appointed 11 Grand Duke's marshals, among them Kiszka, which signified his desire to build an inner circle. =Diplomatic career= Kiszka was sent on his first diplomatic mission in spring 1490. He presented a protest to Ivan III of Russia who harbored and protected Princes Vorotynsky and Belsky who had defected from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During the reign of Alexander, Kiszka served as a diplomatic envoy to the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Kingdom of Poland almost annually. The first of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars ended in 1494 and resulted in substantial territorial losses for Lithuania. Alexander's marriage to Helena of Moscow, daughter of Ivan III of Russia, gave Moscow further pretexts to interfere in Lithuanian affairs. During that tense time, Kiszka was a member of delegations dealing with Russian matters in 1494, 1495, 1498, and 1500. In early 1494, Kiszka received Russian envoys who came to Poland to negotiate the marriage between Alexander and Helena. In early 1495, together with other members of the Lithuanian Council of Lords, he met and greeted Helena on her way to Vilnius. In 1498, hostilities with Russia resumed – Russian army attacked Mtsensk and other locations. In June 1498, Kiszka accompanied by traveled to Moscow in an unsuccessful attempt to broker peace. The full Muscovite–Lithuanian War broke out in 1500 and Kiszka once again attempted to negotiate peace in March 1500. Kiszka was also sent to diplomatic missions to Poland in 1492, 1495, and 1496. In August 1492, he represented Grand Duke Alexander at the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland where Alexander's brother John I Albert was elected as King. In 1501, Kiszka supported the proposed Union of Mielnik which would have united Poland and Lithuania into a single state. The union was inspired by the continuing Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars, particularly the defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha, and Lithuanian desire to secure Polish military support against Russia. Kiszka also attended Sejms in Radom (1505) and Lublin (1506). After the death of Alexander, Lithuanian nobles elected his brother Sigismund as Grand Duke of Lithuania in September 1506. Together with Bishop Wojciech Radziwiłł and voivode Jan Zabrzeziński, Kiszka attended the Polish Sejm in Piotrków Trybunalski that elected Sigismund as King of Poland in December 1506. In general, Kiszka was a strong proponent of a closer union between Poland and Lithuania. =Military career= Kiszka's first military experience was during the Polish–Ottoman War (1485–1503). In 1497, King John I Albert organized an invasion of Moldavia. Lithuanians refused to join the campaign but Grand Duke Alexander sent a small force of volunteers and hired men commanded by Kiszka. The Polish forces were ambushed and defeated in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. In 1499, Kiszka became regent of Smolensk and ordered improvements to Smolensk Kremlin. When the Muscovite–Lithuanian War resumed in 1500, Kiszka commanded a 500-men regiment in the Battle of Vedrosha. Lithuanians, commanded by Konstanty Ostrogski, suffered a great defeat and many Lithuanian nobles, including Kiszka's brother-in-law, were killed. Kiszka then devoted his attention to preparing Smolensk for a Russian assault. For his successful command of the defense during almost the three- month Siege of Smolensk in 1502 he was promoted to the Great Hetman (military commander). A six-year truce with Moscow was concluded in early 1503 and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost about a third of its territory. Kiszka became entangled in a political conflict with royal favorite Michael Glinski and was temporarily removed from the Lithuanian Council of Lords in 1505. In August 1505, Kiszka scored a victory against the invading Crimean Khanate near Haradok. As the Great Hetman, he was supposed to command Lithuanian troops in the Battle of Kletsk against the Crimean Khanate in August 1506 but was unable due to poor health. In summer 1507, Konstanty Ostrogski escaped from Russian service and was reinstated as the Great Hetman. To compensate, Kiszka was appointed as starosta of Hrodna in 1508. When the war with Moscow resumed in 1507, Kiszka organized the defense of Polotsk. During the Glinski rebellion, he defended Minsk and helped to drive out Glinski's forces. His last military commands were near Orsha (18 July 1508) and Vyazma. For his loyal service, Kizska was appointed as Grand Marshal of Lithuania after the death of Mikalojus Kęsgaila in 1512. Dąbrowa coat of arms Family Kiszka was a son of Piotr Strumiłło, starosta of Drohiczyn and Lida, whose ancestors hailed from Mazovia. Kiszka married Anna, daughter of Jan Kuczuk, Grand Duke's marshal, but she died within a few years. Around 1490–1492, he married Sophia Anna, daughter of Petras Jonaitis Mangirdaitis, Voivode of Trakai. The marriage to the last heiress of the influential Mantigirdai family provided a career boost and increased Kiszka's wealth. Kiszka owned large properties across the Grand Duchy, including Ciechanowiec in present-day Poland, Nesvizh, Iwye, , , Lakhva in present-day Belarus, Olyka in present-day Ukraine. His son Piotr was ranked as the 10th wealthiest noble in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania according to the 1528 military census. Kiszka was buried in Ciechanowiec. Kiszka had three known children: *Barbara Kiszka (from first marriage) who married Jerzy Radziwiłł in 1504 *Piotr Kiszka (died in 1534) who became Voivode of Polotsk and Elder of Samogitia *Anna Kiszka (died in 1533) who married Stanislovas Kęsgaila and Jan Radziwiłł References Category:1510s deaths Stanislaw Category:Lithuanian diplomats Category:Great Hetmans of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Grand Marshals of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ","title":"Stanisław Kiszka"},{"id":"44524019","text":"Ursula Koch (1 July 1941 in Zürich, citizen of Zürich) is a former Swiss politician, and was the first women president of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SP).  Early life Born and raised in Zürich, Ursula Koch attended Sekundarschule in the municipality of Stäfa on Zürichsee lake shore. Thereafter she worked as a domestic helper in Lausanne, the so-called Welschlandjahr which at that time usually teenage women absolved in western Switzerland (Welschland) to improve the knowledge of the French language.

Political career  = Kantonsrat and Stadtrat Zürich = As member of the Cantonal Council (Kantonsrat), the legislative assembly of the canton of Zürich, for the SP of the canton of Zürich, Ursula Koch refused, as dedicated woman's politician, the traditional male-oriented oath to the Vaterland and instead pledged allegiance on the Mutterland of office in 1979, but was re-elected until 1986. Beginning in 1986, Ursula Koch was voted as member of the Zürich City Councillor (Stadtrat), the executive board of the city of Zürich. She acted as superintendent of the engineering department (Bauamt II or Hochbaudepartment), i.e. Ursula Koch was responsible for all building construction works in Zürich until 1998. Ursula Koch opposed intensively the opening of the former industrial zones for the construction of more commerce buildings, in favor of more accommodation buildings at moderate prizes; therefore her statement \\"City (of Zürich) is built\\" (in German: Die Stadt Zürich ist gebaut!) on 16 March 1988 to the members of the SIA association,SIA, in German: Schweizerischer Ingenieur- und Architektenverein, literally: Association of the Swiss engineers and architects. the parent organization of Swiss engineers and architects, became her best-known saying. At the 1999 national Council elections, Ursula Koch reached with 122,846 votes the second best result in Switzerland. Despite the top result, the inner-party disputes not declined. As Nationalrätin for the SP party, Ursula Koch was voted by the citizens of the canton Zürich as member of the Nationalrat, the Swiss lower parliament's house, from 6 December 1999 to 10 May 2000, when she resigned for reasons of health. = President of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SP) = On 28 June 1997 Ursula Koch was elected by the members of the SP Switzerland at an extraordinary party congress in Thun, and won, despite lack of political experience at the national level, against Andrea Hämmerle, and succeeded the popular but controversy longyear SP president Peter Bodenmann. From 1997 to April 2000, Ursula Koch was the president of the SP, even being the first women president of the national section of the Swiss social democratic party (SP). After her election as president of the party, Ursula Koch encountered massive rejection of their person, according to own information, and the conflict took place increasingly via media reaching its first peak in March 1998, when the general secretary Barbara Häring resigned. Party colleagues of the so-called \\"Bodenmann-Clan\\" (named after the previous party president) criticized an increasing lack of concept and the absence of the SP in the Swiss political arena. The crisis culminated after a closed-door meeting of the SP executive board on 19 February 2000: the reconciliation within the party leadership did not materialise, and on 15 April Ursula Koch retired by the party leadership and from the parliament due to health reasons. As president of the political party SP, and therefore member of the so-called Elefantenrunde – meaning the presidents of the five most 'important' political parties in Switzerland – Ursula Koch participated at the first live stream broadcast from the Federal Palace of Switzerland (Bundeshaus) in late 1999. Since 2000, she is no more charged in a political office, and in November 2000 Ursula Koch married her long-time life partner.  Publications  * Ursula Koch-Pomeranz: I.

It was designed by Robin Dods and built in 1912 by Hall & Myers. It is also known as St Francis' Theological College Chapel and Chapel of the Holy Spirit. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The stone chapel at Old Bishopsbourne (St Francis' Theological College) was erected in 1912, replacing an earlier timber building of exposed studs designed by diocesan architect Richard George Suter and constructed about 1870. Archbishop Donaldson, arriving at Bishopsbourne in December 1904, recognised the need to replace the original chapel, which had fallen into disrepair. In 1912 Donaldson commissioned diocesan architects Hall and Dods to design a chapel which would harmonise with the house and grounds. Robin Smith Dods produced the design, and the chapel was constructed under his supervision by builders Hall and Meyers. It was dedicated in 1912. Dods practised in Brisbane from 1896 to 1916. With this chapel he displayed a mastery of materials and form, proving that simplicity of construction and design can be as powerful as more elaborate structures. Since 1936 the chapel has been carefully maintained by generations of St Francis' Theological College students. A loft and restored pipe organ, which were donated from a neighbouring church, were installed at the western end of the chapel in 1971. While Anglican schools in Queensland generally have a chapel, few would be as old as St Francis', and even fewer would be of local stone.  Description  Archbishop Halse with other clergy at the Bishopbourne Chapel, 1954 The chapel is constructed of Brisbane tuff, to a simple rectangular plan . The ambience created is that of a medieval shrine blending with Queensland vernacular and derived stylistic elements of the early 20th century. thick walls with buttresses support a steeply pitched, slate-clad roof. The roof structure of six timber trusses is exposed. The chapel is lit by long, narrow, Gothic windows in the bays between the buttresses. These windows are unusual in that the lower sections of the openings are unglazed, and are fitted with tongue and groove timber shutters to assist with ventilation and light. A side porch projects over the entrance, which leads to a small vestry. This is divided from the entrance and interior generally by a timber screen. The floor is above ground level and is covered with red concrete. At the east end the floor originally rose to the sanctuary in the traditional five steps, but the top step has been removed to allow the altar to be detached from the rear wall and to stand free. The chapel is simply furnished and displays a minimum of adornment. The sanctuary is panelled in silky oak, and decoration of the timber altar is limited to gilded motifs of Australian flora. The loft at the western end has been installed sympathetically.  Heritage listing  Old Bishopsbourne Chapel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Historically it is significant for its close association with the Anglican Archbishops of Brisbane for over 50 years, and with the theological college since 1936. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is important for its rarity of function, fabric and setting in Brisbane, and remains an integral element in the historic Old Bishopsbourne (St Francis Theological College) ecclesiastical grouping.

It was built from 1892 to 1893. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2000.  History  The Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd was constructed in 1892. The architect is unknown, however, it is possible that the design may be attributed to the work of John Hingeston Buckeridge, architect for the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane from 1886–1902. Buckeridge lived in Sydney from 1892 and managed the design of church buildings from there. Reverend John Vincent, the first chaplain in the penal settlement of Moreton Bay, then part of the Diocese of Newcastle, arrived in 1829. Up until the late 1840s, parishioners held services in makeshift buildings, open-air services and in private homes. In 1848 land was chosen in the present Queen's Park in George Street for the first Anglican Church in Brisbane, St John the Evangelist. With the establishment of the Colony of Queensland in December 1859, it became necessary to form a new diocese within the Anglican Church. The Bishop of the new Diocese of Brisbane, Reverend Edward Wyndham Tufnell, arrived in September 1860. Tufnell brought with him six young clergymen, including the Reverend Thomas Jones who played an important part in the early days of the Church of the Good Shepherd and other churches of the diocese. By 1870, the Parish of Toowong had been formed and Brookfield was included as a remote part of that parish. By this time, Brookfield was settled by farmers and timbergetters who had arrived in the area in the late 1850s and 1860s. The Reverend Robert Creyke administered to the remote areas of the large parish. A centre for worship was established at Indooroopilly in 1887 and the Church of St Andrew was formally opened by William Webber, Anglican Bishop of Brisbane, on 25 August 1889. It is possible that Hedley Allen Dunn was the architect of this church. On 9 January 1890, the Parish of Toowong was divided and the boundaries of the Indooroopilly Parish were fixed, making Brookfield a remote part of the Indooroopilly Parish. Even with a change in Parish boundaries, the Anglican parishioners of Brookfield were still required to travel some distance to church. During one of his visits to Brookfield for services the Reverend Arthur Richard Rivers encouraged the local people to construct a church, and consequently, a Building Committee was established. The land that was acquired for the building of a church, on the corner of Brookfield and Boscombe Streets, had been surveyed for sale in 1859. It was originally part of a land grant farmed by John McGrath, who obtained the Deed of Grant in January 1861. It was in October 1892 that the Building Committee purchased the land, for , from the owner, William Thomas Gee. On 21 November 1892, the solicitors, Wilson, Newman-Wilson and Hemming, forwarded to the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane the Certificate of Title for the land on which the Church of the Good Shepherd was to be built. The church cost to build and was consecrated on Easter Monday 2 April 1893. The architect of the church is unknown, though, it is likely that it was not designed directly by John Hingeston Buckeridge, the Diocesan Architect. There were, however, plans drawn by Buckeridge which Bishop Webber made available to some Building Committees. These plans were intended to assist in costing and assessing sizes, and the Church of the Good Shepherd may have been based on one of these plans. To reduce costs the interior was originally unlined, revealing the studwork, and the timber was oiled rather than stained or painted. The gable roofs of the church were originally clad with \\"stringy-bark\\" shingles. The north vestry appears to have been added after the building was opened and may account for the presence of chamferboards on the internal south wall of the vestry. The later addition of vestries was not uncommon was usually related to funding availability. Sometime in the 1930s, the shingle roof was replaced by iron sheeting and in the early 1950s, the interior walls were lined and painted. The chancel interior was clad with \\"masonite\\" and louvre windows were installed on either side of the altar. During the 1960s, further maintenance work was carried out and the church was repainted and rewired. The sanctuary was relined with clear-finished, horizontal pine boards and the floor around the vestry and pulpit was repaired. During this time the church floor was sanded and varnished. In 1968, the Parish of Kenmore, Brookfield and Moggill was formed. During the 1980s, stained glass was installed and the church was repaired once more. The adjacent parish hall was built in 1985 to the designs of architect Philip Gough. The church bell, originally located outside the vestry, was moved to a position north of the west porch.  Description  Rear view, 2009 The Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd is a single-storey, timber church set on wooden stumps, sited on a rise to the northern side of Brookfield Road. It comprises a four-bay nave, a chancel and a north vestry and west porch. There is a separate sanctuary with an independent roof and raised floor. The church measures twelve metres by six metres, excluding the vestry and porch, and has a seating capacity of approximately eighty. The church is clad externally in white painted chamferboards. The east window is an under-scaled triplet and the taller flanking windows are set in square frames. The glass in the east windows, including the centre panel depicting the Good Shepherd, was installed in 1981. The west gable wall is characterised by the central west porch and the scalloped timber barge boards. The apex of the west wall has a vent opening with a pointed arch head and is fitted with timber louvres. The gable of the west porch is clad in weatherboards and the porch walls are open above the timber railing. The four lancet windows in each of the nave side walls comprise two centre pivoting timber-frame windows each with a central transom. The gable roofs of the nave and west porch are sheeted with corrugated iron painted red. The roofs over the nave and the porch have decorative scalloped timber bargeboards. Internally, the nave has an open timber ceiling comprising tied principal rafters, purlins and diagonally laid boards. All ceiling timbers in the nave have been painted. The interior walls of the nave have been lined in sheet material with cover battens over the joints and painted. The unpainted timber ceiling over the sanctuary follows the polygonal plan and reveals rafters and diagonal boarding. Two metal tie rods restrain the sanctuary walls at eave level. The pointed arch chancel arch, somewhat awkwardly integrated with a square opening to the sanctuary, is surmounted by a louvred gable vent. The sanctuary walls have been clad in clear finished, horizontal pine boards. The suspended timber floor has east–west laid boards. The Church is surrounded by mature conifers and eucalypts. The Parish Hall (1985) is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.

Many simple timber churches were constructed throughout Queensland, this example is distinguished by the quality of its design and by its visual cohesion with other historic buildings in the area, including the Uniting Church, constructed in 1871, Brookfield School, established in 1874 and the Brookfield cemetery, established in 1872. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a place of public worship for over 100 years, the Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd has social value for the local Anglican community.

It is also known as Mount Coot-tha Reserve. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2007.  History  Mount Coot-tha Forest is part of the Taylor Range which forms a backdrop of hills to the city of Brisbane, and is the best known vantage point from which to view Brisbane and surrounds, offering sweeping views of the city, Moreton Bay, Stradbroke Island and the southern ranges. Since the 1870s the area has been extensively utilised in a number of ways including as a timber reserve, a vantage point, a place of recreation, for gold mining, as a military site and for television broadcasting. It is now predominantly used as a recreation and picnicking area and is the broadcasting site for several television stations. It forms part of Brisbane Forest Park. The Taylor Range was originally named Glenmorrison Range by the explorer John Oxley in 1823. In the earliest recorded visit to Mount Coot-tha by European explorers, including surveyor Allan Cunningham, on 6 July 1828, this range was referred to as Glenmoriston's Range and Sir Herbert Taylor's Range by the colonial botanist, Charles Fraser, and as Glenmorriston's Range by Captain Patrick Logan, Commandant of the penal settlement at Brisbane. Fraser's journal describes in detail the species of trees found there, and that the view from the south-east to north-west was extensive and very grand. During the decades following the commencement of free settlement in Brisbane in 1842, Mount Coot-tha appears to have been highly valued as a vantage point for recreation and survey and as the source of fresh water streams. The area was originally known as One Tree Hill after all the vegetation on the knoll was cleared except for one large gum tree. When Reverend Bell made an application in 1865 to purchase land on One Tree Hill, it was refused with the Surveyor General noting it was required for trigonometrical purposes, and moreover was frequently used by the people of Brisbane for recreation on account of the extensive views and fresh air. Thus Mount Coot-tha's value as a vantage point and a place of recreation was recognised at an early stage in the city's development. In 1860 Brisbane Forest Park was investigated for gold prospecting opportunities through the government funded Gold Exploration Expedition. The findings of the expedition was that, with one or two exceptions, there were no discoveries worthy of notice. Despite this, gold prospectors persisted and a number of small claims were established. It was 1894 before the first claim was recorded in Mount Coot-tha Forest and seemed to have been a tentative affair, not proceeding beyond the initial explorations. In 1933 it was cleaned out and retested. The remains of these attempts are still evident on the eastern bank of Ithaca Creek. Gold prospecting continued intermittently in Mount Coot-tha Forest until the early 1950s but no significant finds were recorded. Some remnants of these activities remain with a number of shafts, open cuts and a trolley line dating from the early 1950s. The Taylor Range provided a source of good timber and One Tree Hill was first proclaimed a reserve for railway purposes on 21 February 1873 in order that the source of timber could be secured for development of the railway from Ipswich to Brisbane. In 1880 the timber reserve was cancelled and the area was re-designated as a Reserve for a Public Park under the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1861. One Tree Hill, including of surrounding bush land, extending from Toowong Cemetery to Gap Creek, was placed in the care of a body of trustees and declared a reserve for public recreation. The site was renamed Mount Coot-tha in 1883 with the name being thought to derive from the aboriginal word for native honey, ku-ta. The Trust oversaw numerous works projects in the Reserve including fencing, road construction and clearing vegetation. In 1884 the Trust recorded the attendance of some 9000 visitors to the area between April and December demonstrating its popularity with the public. Mount Coot-tha Forest became even more accessible to the public with the granting of the Saturday half- holiday in Queensland, as part of the Factories and Shops Act 1900. The half- holiday was the beginning of the weekend as an institution, and together with public holidays, the popularity of recreation areas and activities increased. The traditional route up Mount Coot-tha, and now one of the main access roads, is Sir Samuel Griffith Drive. Originally people walked up Mount Coot-tha and from this a track developed. By the 1870s some adventurous people were driving up with horses and carriages. When the area became a public park in 1880, the track was improved to become a steep and windy road that traversed Mount Coot- tha in a circular route, a popular route for walkers, buggies and the occasional motorist. This track formed the basis of Sir Samuel Griffith Drive, named after one of the more eminent trustees, Sir Samuel Griffith, twice Premier of Queensland, from 1883 to 1888 and then again from 1890 to 1893. By the 1920s it was a favoured scenic circuit regularly utilised by motoring day- trippers and for car rallies and in the early 1930s was dedicated as a public road. Looking at the view has been the most popular and continuing form of recreation on Mount Coot-tha and in 1886, to accommodate people's needs, a shelter shed and water tank were erected on the area of the present Mt Coot- tha Lookout. In 1901 a pedestal and directional dial, identifying elements of the panorama, were installed. For many years this small feature was a landmark for visitors to the lookout and was a precursor to the directional plate located on the modern lookout platform. A small timber kitchen was later built in 1912. A larger kiosk was constructed c.1918 and formed the basis of the present kiosk. In 1928 the kiosk was enlarged and a two-storey timber extension for living quarters was added. The early shelter shed and small kitchen were demolished. During World War II the lookout was converted to military use. In 1949 and 1950 further work and extensions were carried out including a circular drive, new entrance, raised viewing platform, lounge and lavatories, extensions to the living quarters and construction of a timber tankstand. Prior to the First World War, two dams were built on the gully formed by East Ithaca Creek, in the area now known as J.C. Slaughter Falls. It is unclear when and by whom the dams were constructed although records show them being in place by 1913. The dams were appreciated as a scenic picnic spot and by bird-watchers, wildlife enthusiasts and amateur artists. The destruction of the lower dam by flood in 1916 did not detract from the appeal of the setting and it \\"remained a spectacular ruin\\" below the new dam, erected in 1921. By the mid-1950s the area had fallen into disrepair and the surviving dam was demolished in the late 1960s or early 1970s. In 1974, following extensive improvements along East Ithaca Creek gully, J.C. Slaughter Falls Park, named in honour of the Town Clerk and City Administrator from 1940 to 1967, was opened. In the West Ithaca Creek area a similar development was completed in the late 1970s and was named after the local pioneering landowner Captain Henry George Simpson. In 1919, following some years of financial difficulties, the Trust was disbanded and the Reserve was transferred to the Toowong Town Council. In 1925, the Queensland Parliament passed the City of Brisbane Act 1924 to set up a single local government in Brisbane. This led to control of Mount Coot-tha passing to the newly formed Brisbane City Council. The first elected mayor was Sir William Jolly and part of his election promise was the extension and improvement of the park system, including the securing of vantage points like Mount Coot-tha. Therefore, under the Jolly administration, the area of the Reserve expanded dramatically, acquiring more than . On his retirement Jolly stated that he felt that securing Mount Coot- tha Reserve was one of his administration's most important achievements. During the Second World War, the Mount Coot-tha Forest was turned over for military use and served as a mine storage and assembly depot. They redirected water from several of the creeks in the area to provide water for the military. Personnel from the 55th US Naval Construction Battalion and the RAAF Magnetic and Acoustic Mines Section were based at the depot, with the major camp area lying on the eastern point of the Forest near the present Hoop Pine picnic area. In 1944 the facility was dismantled and moved to Darwin although work was carried out on the building and mine depots until 1945. Rehabilitation of the area commenced in late 1946. A number of features installed by the military such as some concrete slabs, concrete channeling, footbridges and terracing still remain. The concrete slabs have been incorporated into the picnic areas as the floors of picnic shelters and as the floor of the open air chapel at J.C. Slaughter Falls. The 1950s saw the introduction of television to Australia and by 1959 Channel Nine and Channel Seven both commenced broadcasting in Brisbane resulting in Brisbane City Council giving permission for the construction of transmission towers on Mount Coot-tha. Eventually two more towers were constructed for Channel Ten and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The three towers for the commercial television stations, Channel Seven, Channel Nine and Channel Ten, are located on private freehold land along with their respective studio facilities. The fourth tower, used by the ABC, is on land owned by the Brisbane City Council. The towers are highly visible from many parts of Brisbane, even at night as they are mounted with blinking warning lights for aviation purposes. The towers are not included in the entry in the Heritage Register. Apart from its many different land uses by the people of Queensland, Mount Coot-tha Forest provides an area of natural habitat for plants and animals. Its topography provides a variety of habitats for vegetation and for many species of fauna, including three rare species of owl - Powerful owl (Ninox strenua), Masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae) and Sooty owl (Tyto tenebricosa). Mount Coot-tha Forest has an extensive and diverse history of uses and associations since the late 1800s to the present including as a timber reserve, a vantage point, a place of recreation, for gold mining, as a military site and for television broadcasting. Its predominant use now is as a recreation and picnicking area and it is the broadcasting site for several television stations.  Description  Mount Coot-tha Forest is one of Brisbane's largest natural areas, with over of open eucalypt forest just 15 minutes drive from the CBD. Flanking the south-western suburbs of Brisbane lies the Taylor Range, the southern end of which ends abruptly at Mount Coot-tha. It is located approximately west of Brisbane CBD and abuts the suburbs of Enoggera, The Gap, Ashgrove, Bardon, Rainworth, Toowong, Taringa, Chapel Hill, Kenmore Hills and Brookfield. It is primarily accessed by Simpsons Road, Mount Coot-tha Road, Sir Samuel Griffith Drive, Dillon Road, Gap Creek Road and Gold Creek Road. The vegetation of Mount Coot-tha is mainly associated with dry eucalypt forest including the species, Spotted gum (Corymbia varigata), Grey gum (Eucalyptus propinqua), Forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis) and Narrow-leafed ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra). Various species of acacias, including Brisbane Golden Wattle (Acacia fimbriata) and Broadleaf Wattle (Acacia implexa) are predominant in the understorey shrubs along with grass trees Xanthorrhoea species. Native grasses, primarily Kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra) and Blady grass (Imperata cylindrica) make up the minimal ground cover. Sir Samuel Griffith Drive is a two lane circuit of the outer edge of Mount Coot-tha. It has an undulating circuit through open forest and offers shifting views of the city. It is a renowned tourist drive, providing access to many picnic areas and vantage points in Mount Coot-tha Forest. Gold mining related remnants include a wooden trolley line, well, wooden shaft structure, battery site, concrete plinth, iron cover, dam, sump and ore dump. Second World War remnants include concrete slabs and a number of creek crossings, concrete drains and footbridges at the J.C. Slaughter Falls and Hoop Pine Picnic Grounds. There is also a \\"Detonator Locker\\", cut into a hillside and partially covered with earth, beside one of the walking tracks in J.C. Slaughter Falls Park. It is formed by curved corrugated iron, rolled to an elliptical profile. The manufacturer's stamp \\"Manufactured by the American Rolling Mill Co. Middleton Ohio\\" is still clearly visible. The back wall of the shelter is formed by tray-profile sheet metal. A steel frame surrounds the opening. There is a section of steel frame inside the shelter, which appears to have been built to reinforce the structure. The ABC broadcast tower and associated structures (located on Lease A on SP122735) are not included in the entry in the Heritage Register.  Heritage listing  Mount Coot-tha Forest was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mount Coot-tha Forest is an early example of the importance that the Queensland public placed upon recreational, scenic and environmental values. It has been used as a vantage point since the first recorded European ascent of Mount Coot-tha in 1828. Since then, the growing popularity of visiting the summit has reflected the emergence of leisure and recreation time for the general populace, and the advent and popularity of the motor car. The area has been continually used and enjoyed by the public since the early development of Brisbane. It is also important for demonstrating a range of different land uses such as a reference point for surveying, timber reserve, gold mining and military activities that are representative of Queensland history while retaining its original values. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The remnants of gold mining in Mount Coot-tha Forest represents a now uncommon aspect of Queensland's history. While gold prospecting was once a common way of life in Queensland, the proximity of gold prospecting activity so close to Brisbane is uncommon. These remnants are the only physical evidence left of the attempts to establish a fledgling gold industry at Mount Coot-tha. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The remnants of gold mining activity have the potential to yield information about the nature and scope of the activities that took place in Mount Coot-tha Forest which will contribute to an understanding of how the area was used over time. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Mount Coot-tha Forest is important because of its aesthetic significance as a prominent scenic and landmark element in the cityscape and affords spectacular views in all directions, as well as views to the mountain, particularly from the city. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The recreational, scenic and environmental attributes of Mount Coot-tha Forest have been valued by the people of Brisbane since the early days of European settlement in Brisbane. The use of the area for leisure activities was strengthened with the legislation of the Saturday half day holiday in 1900 which heralded the beginning of the traditional weekend. The picnic areas and walking tracks are evidence of the continuity of recreational activities in Mount Coot-tha Forest since the late 1800s to the present and the area is popular with different recreational groups including scouts, bushwalkers, runners and mountain bike riders. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Mount Coot-tha Forest has strong association with former Queensland Premiers Sir Samuel Griffith, who was a trustee, and Sir William Jolly who, through his administration in the mid 1920s, was instrumental in maintaining and expanding Mount Coot-tha Forest and played an important role in ensuring the area was preserved for the enjoyment of the Queensland public into the future.

Cassidy got the bill when the bartender cashed his check the night before. The bartender recalls getting it from jewelry store proprietor Charlie Daggett. Cassidy goes to Cooper and begs him to keep publishing The Guardian, offering him a story that will sell many newspapers for weeks. Cooper insists he print it in The Record or else he will turn him over to the police for withholding information. Cassidy flees. Cassidy decides to track down the kidnappers. He sneaks in past a protective police cordon to see Ellen Frazier and, posing as a lawyer, persuades her to leave with him and identify the crooks if she can. She does not recognize Daggett, but he tells Cassidy who gave him the $100: a Mrs. Lovelake. Mrs. Lovelake's husband, a doctor, recalls receiving the bill from a patient with a knife wound, a black boxer named James Alley. Ellen leaves while Cassidy is questioning Daggett, but later returns after he sees the Lovelakes. He convinces her to go to Davie Bryant at the newspaper, where she will hopefully be safe, but she is abducted at gunpoint on the street. Meanwhile, Cassidy goes to see Alley, but finds himself at his wake. It turns out he was run over by a car. His widow Ruby reluctantly admits she got the money from a friend of singer Lorna Travers, but does not know his name. Posing as a treasury agent, Cassidy gets the name from Travers, none other than Cooper. Cooper got the $100 as part of his winnings at Arno's gambling house. Arno is an old friend of Cassidy's; he points the reporter to two gangsters as the likely source of the bill. However, this information makes him realize his brother Phil must be mixed up in the kidnapping, so Arno reluctantly tips off the crooks that Cassidy is coming. Cassidy is easily captured. Phil Arno, who had laundered money for the criminals, gets a guilty conscience and helps Cassidy and Ellen escape death at the cost of his own life. Cassidy breaks the story for his paper. Cooper then decides not to close The Guardian after all.

Risks of this nature are typically excluded from traditional commercial general liability policies or at least are not specifically defined in traditional insurance products. Coverage provided by cyber-insurance policies may include first-party coverage against losses such as data destruction, extortion, theft, hacking, and denial of service attacks; liability coverage indemnifying companies for losses to others caused, for example, by errors and omissions, failure to safeguard data, or defamation; and other benefits including regular security-audit, post-incident public relations and investigative expenses, and criminal reward funds. Advantages Because the cyber-insurance market in many countries is relatively small compared to other insurance products, its overall impact on emerging cyber threats is difficult to quantify. As the impact to people and businesses from cyber threats is also relatively broad when compared to the scope of protection provided by insurance products, insurance companies continue to develop their services. As insurers payout on cyber-losses, and as cyber threats develop and change, insurance products are increasingly being purchased alongside existing IT security services. Indeed, the underwriting criteria for insurers to offer cyber-insurance products are also early in development, and underwriters are actively partnering with IT security companies to develop their products. As well as directly improving security, cyber-insurance is enormously beneficial in the event of a large-scale security breach. Insurance provides a smooth funding mechanism for recovery from major losses, helping businesses to return to normal and reducing the need for government assistance.BIGS (2017) Finally, insurance allows cyber- security risks to be distributed fairly, with the cost of premiums commensurate with the size of expected loss from such risks. This avoids potentially dangerous concentrations of risk while also preventing free- riding. Disadvantages Information Technology is an inherent facet of virtually all modern businesses, the requirement for a separate product only exists because of a deliberate scoping exercise which has excluded theft and damage associated with modern technologies from the existing product lines. Bruce Schneier has postulated that existing insurance practices tend to follow either the \\"Flood or Fire\\" modelhttps://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/04/cybersecurity_i_1.html however Cyber events don't appear to be modeled by either of these event types, this has led to the situation where the scope of Cyber Insurance is further restricted to decrease the risk to the underwriters. Compounding this is a paucity of data relating to actual damage correlated with the type of event, a lack of standards associated with the classification of events, and a lack of evidence associated with the efficacy of \\"Industry best practices\\".https://www.wired.com/story/cyberinsurance-tackles-the-wildly- unpredictable-world-of-hacks/ Insurance relies upon sound actuarial data against a largely static background of risk. Given that these don't exist at present it is unlikely that either the buyers of these products will achieve the value outcomes that they desire. This view of the market is reflected in the current market state where standard exclusions result in a situation where \\"An insurer could argue they apply to almost any data breach\\".https://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150515/NEWS06/150519893 History  Early works in the 1990s focused on the general merits of cyber- insurance, or protocols borrowed from digital cash to enable risk reallocation in distributed systems. In the late 1990s, when the business perspective of information security became more prominent, visions of cyber-insurance as a risk management tool were formulated. Although its roots in the 1980s looked promising, battered by events such as Y2K and the 9/11 attacks, the market for cyber-insurance failed to thrive and remained in a niche for unusual demands. Coverage is tightly limited, and clients include SMBs (small and medium businesses) in need of insurance to qualify for tenders, or community banks too small to hedge the risks of their online banking operations. If not the first, at least one of the first, cyber liability policies as we now call them was developed for the Lloyd's of London market in 2000. The policy was spearheaded by Keith Daniels and Rob Hamesfahr then attorneys with the Chicago, IL law firm of Blatt, Hammesfahr & Eaton. Working closely with Ian Hacker, then a Lloyd's underwriter, and Ted Doolittle and Kinsey Carpenter, then brokers with Kinsey Carpenter, a San Francisco, CA insurance broker, the policy provided third-party coverage along with business interruption coverage. In those early days, it was thought that a big risk would be for a company to negligently transmit a virus that could infect other companies' systems who would then bring suit against the original company as well as business interruption. The policy was one of the first, as well, to include first-party and third-party coverages in the same form. While such errors & omissions have likely happened, suits against organizations on this basis have proven to be rare. The focus of forms that have developed since 2000 has been on business interruption, payment of fines and penalties, credit monitoring costs, public relations costs, and the cost of restoring or rebuilding private data, and they continue to expand and evolve today. Also, technology errors & omissions policies are now sold with third-party coverage to organizations, such as programmers and technology installers who could get sued if their advice or product fails to be satisfactory to their clients. Other early entrants to the cyber market included American International Group (AIG) and Chubb. Today, more than 80 companies are competing in the cyber market. Even a 2002 conservative forecast, which predicted a global market for cyber- insurance worth $2.5 billion in 2005, turned out to be five times higher than the size of the market in 2008. Overall, in relative terms, the market for cyber-insurance shrank as the Internet economy grew. In practice, several obstacles have prevented the market for cyber-insurance from achieving maturity; absence of reliable actuarial data to compute insurance premiums, lack of awareness among decision-makers contributing to too little demand, as well as legal and procedural hurdles have been identified in the first generation\\" of cyber-insurance literature until about 2005. The latter aspect may cause frustration when claiming compensation for damages. Furthermore, entities considering cyber-insurance must undergo a series of often invasive security evaluation procedures, revealing their IT infrastructures and policies. Meanwhile, witnessing thousands of vulnerabilities, millions of attacks, and substantial improvement in defining security standards and computer forensics calls into question the validity of these factors to causally explain the lack of an insurance market.  Types  * Network Security - Insurance against cyber attacks and hacking attacks. * Theft and fraud. Covers destruction or loss of the policyholder’s data as the result of a criminal or fraudulent cyber event, including theft and transfer of funds. * Forensic investigation. Covers the legal, technical, or forensic services necessary to assess whether a cyber attack has occurred, to assess the impact of the attack, and to stop an attack. * Business interruption. Covers lost income and related costs where a policyholder is unable to conduct business due to a cyber event or data loss. * Extortion. Provides coverage for the costs associated with the investigation of threats to commit cyber attacks against the policyholder’s systems and for payments to extortionists who threaten to obtain and disclose sensitive information. * Reputation Insurance : Insurance against reputation attacks and cyber defamation. * Computer data loss and restoration. Covers physical damage to, or loss of use of, computer- related assets, including the costs of retrieving and restoring data, hardware, software, or other information destroyed or damaged as the result of a cyber attack. * Information Privacy. Covers organizational liability(ies) arising from actual or alleged non-compliance with any worldwide cyber, information privacy, or identity-related regulation, statute, or the law. For example, this coverage part would cover an organization's legal defense, and ultimate monetary settlement, resulting from a regulatory claim alleging such organization was non-compliant with any covered privacy regulation, such as the \\"right to (personal information) erasure\\" governed within the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.https://medium.com/at-bay/is-your- clients-cyber-insurance-policy-gdpr-ready-eb42b3be8afa Current need  The infrastructure, the users, and the services offered on computer networks today are all subject to a wide variety of risks posed by threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses, spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by these threats, network users have traditionally resorted to antivirus and anti-spam software, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the resulting negative impact of the anomalies. Despite improvements in risk protection techniques over the last decade due to hardware, software, and cryptographic methodologies, it is impossible to achieve perfect/near-perfect cyber-security protection. The impossibility arises due to a number of reasons: * Scarce existence of sound technical solutions. * Difficulty in designing solutions catered to varied intentions behind network attacks. * Misaligned incentives between network users, security product vendors, and regulatory authorities regarding protecting the network. * Network users taking advantage of the positive security effects generated by other users' investments in security, in turn, themselves not investing in security and resulting in the free-riding problem. * Customer lock-in and first-mover effects of vulnerable security products. * Difficulty to measure risks resulting in challenges to designing pertinent risk removal solutions. * The problem of a lemons market, whereby security vendors have no incentive to release robust products in the market. * Liability shell games played by product vendors. * User naiveness in optimally exploiting feature benefits of technical solutions. Given the above-mentioned inevitable barriers to near 100% risk mitigation, the need arises for alternative methods for risk management in cyberspace. To highlight the importance of improving the current state of cyber-security, US President Barack Obama issued a cyber-security executive order in February of 2013 that emphasizes the need to reduce cyber-threats and be resilient to them. In this regard, some security researchers in the recent past have identified cyber- insurance as a potential tool for effective risk management. Cyber-insurance is a risk management technique via which network user risks are transferred to an insurance company, in return for a fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Examples of potential cyber-insurers might include ISP, cloud provider, traditional insurance organizations. Proponents of cyber-insurance believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability to the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here the term ‘self-defense' implies the efforts by a network user to secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus and anti-spam software, firewalls, using secure operating systems, etc. Cyber-insurance has also the potential to be a market solution that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (individuals/organizations), policymakers, and security software vendors. i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn profit from appropriately pricing premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, policymakers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the security software vendors could experience an increase in their product sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers. A key area to manage risk is to establish what is an acceptable risk for each organization. Practicing 'duty of care' helps protect all interested parties - executives, regulators, judges, the public who can be affected by those risks. The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides practices and principles to help balance compliance, security, and business objectives when developing security controls. Existing issues  Consequently, during 2005, a “second generation\\" of cyber-insurance literature emerged targeting risk management of current cyber-networks. The authors of such literature link the market failure with fundamental properties of information technology, specially correlated risk information asymmetries between insurers and insureds, and inter-dependencies. Information asymmetry has a significant negative effect on most insurance environments, where typical considerations include inability to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk) types, i.e., the so-called adverse selection problem, as well as users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so-called moral hazard problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in security to counter risks generate positive externalities for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions, thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes it spans only one or two entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much easier. =War exclusion clauses= Like other insurance policies, cyber insurance typically includes a war exclusion clause - explicitly excluding damage from acts of war. While the majority of cyber insurance claims will relate to simple criminal behaviour, increasingly companies are likely to fall victim to cyberwarfare attacks by nation-states or terrorist organizations - whether specifically targeted or simply collateral damage. After the US and UK, governments characterized the NotPetya attack as a Russian military cyber- attack insurers are arguing that they do not cover such events. Current work  Current work regarding the existence of cyber-insurance markets is few. Among the important ones are the works by (i) Lelarge and Bolot, (ii) Pal, Golubchik, Psounis, and Hui, (iii) Johnson et al., and (iv) Shetty, et al. These works first comment on the free-riding behavior of Internet users without the presence of cyber-insurance. The works by Lelarge et al and Shetty et al present the benefits of cyber-insurance in incentivizing Internet users to invest appropriately in security; however, their works address restricted market types. Lelarge et al do not model information asymmetry in their work. Shetty et al prove that cyber-insurance markets are inefficient under conditions of information asymmetry. Johnson et al discuss the role of the joint existence of self-insurance and market insurance on the adoption of the different types of insurance by users. In most recent work, Pal et al prove the inefficiency of cyber-insurance markets under conditions of partial information asymmetry and correlated risks and show the existence of efficient markets (both regulated and unregulated) under premium discrimination. Availability As of 2014, 90% of the cyber-insurance premium volume was covering exposure in the United States. Although at least 50 insurance companies have cyber-insurance product offerings, the actual writing is concentrated within a group of five underwriters. Many insurance companies have been hesitant to enter this coverage market, as sound actuarial data for cyber exposure is non-existent. Hampering the development of this actuarial data is inadequate disclosure regarding cyber attacks by those affected. After a significant malware incident in 2017, however, Reckitt Benckiser released information on how much the cyberattack would impact financial performance, leading some analysts to believe the trend is for companies to be more transparent with data from cyber incidents. With cyber insurance premiums expected to grow from around $2 billion in 2015 to an estimated $20 billion or more by 2025, insurers and reinsurers are continuing to refine underwriting requirements. Market immaturity and lack of standardization are two reasons why underwriting cyber products today make it an interesting place to be in the insurance world. Not only do you have an insurance marketplace that’s trying to reach a standard and accommodate the needs of today’s insured, but you also, at the same time, have a rapidly developing exposure landscape and capacity available.

The first Europeans to arrive on Catalina claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Over the years, territorial claims to the island transferred to Mexico and then to the United States. During this time, the island was sporadically used for smuggling, otter hunting, and gold-digging. Catalina was successfully developed into a tourist destination by chewing gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr. beginning in the 1920s, with most of the activity centered around the only incorporated city of Avalon, California. Since the 1970s, most of the island has been administered by the Catalina Island Conservancy. Pre-European settlement Prior to the modern era, the island was inhabited by people of the Gabrielino/Tongva tribe, who, having had villages near present-day San Pedro and Playa del Rey, regularly traveled back and forth to Catalina for trade. The Tongva called the island Pimu or Pimugna and referred to themselves as the Pimugnans or Pimuvit. Archeological evidence shows Pimugnan settlement beginning in 7000 BCE. The Pimugnans had settlements all over the island at one time or another, with their biggest villages being at the Isthmus and at present-day Avalon, Shark/Little Harbor, and Emerald Bay. The Pimugnans were renowned for their mining, working and trade of soapstone which was found in great quantities and varieties on the island. This material was in great demand to make stone vessels for cooking and was traded along the California coast. Archaeologists have learned much about these tribes from middens, ancient dumps where they tossed everything they no longer needed. These middens can today be identified by mounds of crumbled abalone shells. It is estimated that there are over 2,000 middens on Catalina Island, only half of which have been discovered. Evidence from these middens indicate that around 2000 BCE as many as 2,500 lived on Catalina Island.Baker, Gayle. \\"Catalina Island\\", HarborTown Histories, Santa Barbara, California, 2002, p. 7, (print), 978-0-9879038-0-8 (on-line) European explorers Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo The first European to set foot on the island was the Portuguese explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who sailed in the name of the Spanish crown. On October 7, 1542, he claimed the island for Spain and christened it San Salvador after his ship (Catalina has also been identified as one of the many possible burial sites for Cabrillo). Over half a century later, another Spanish explorer, Sebastián Vizcaíno, rediscovered the island on the eve of Saint Catherine's day (November 24) in 1602. Vizcaino renamed the island in the saint's honor. The colonization of California by the Spanish coincided with the decline of the Pimugnans. They suffered from the introduction of new diseases to which they had little immunity and the disruption of their trade and social networks caused by the establishment of the California missions. By the 1830s, the island's entire native population were either dead or had migrated to the mainland to work in the missions or as ranch hands for the many private landowners. Franciscan friars considered building a mission there, but abandoned the idea because of the lack of fresh water on the island. While Spain maintained its claim on Catalina Island, foreigners were forbidden to trade with colonies. However, it lacked the ships to enforce this prohibition, and the island served as home or base of operation for many visitors. Hunters from the Aleutian Islands, Russia, and America set up camps on Santa Catalina and the surrounding Channel Islands to hunt otters and seals around the island for their pelts. The pelts were then sold for high prices in China. Smuggling also took place on the island for a long period of time. Pirates found that the island's abundance of hidden coves, as well as its short distance to the mainland and its small population, made it suitable for smuggling activities. Once used by smugglers of illegal Chinese immigrants, China Point, located on the south western end of Catalina, still bears its namesake. Mexican land grant Governor Pío Pico made a Mexican land grant of the Island of Santa Catalina to Thomas M. Robbins in 1846, as Rancho Santa Catalina. Thomas M. Robbins (1801–1854) a sea captain who came to California in 1823, married the daughter of Carlos Antonio Carrillo. Robbins established a small rancho on the island, but sold it in 1850 to José María Covarrubias. A claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853, and the grant was patented to José María Covarrubias in 1867. Covarrubias sold the island to Albert Packard of Santa Barbara in 1853. By 1864 the entire island was owned by James Lick, whose estate maintained control of the island for approximately the next 25 years. In the fall of 1857 the whaler Charles Melville Scammon, in the brig Boston, rendezvoused with his schooner-tender Marin in the \\"snug harbor\\" of Catalina (some have suggested Avalon Bay but it's more likely Catalina Harbor). They left on November 30 for Laguna Ojo de Liebre to become the first to hunt the gray whales breeding there. Catalina's gold rush Three otter hunters, George Yount, Samuel Prentiss, and Stephen Bouchette, are responsible for the Island's short-lived gold rush. Yount found promising samples and, shortly before he died in 1854, told some discouraged 1849 Gold Rush miners. Samuel Prentiss, Catalina's first non-native permanent resident, was told of a buried gold treasure. He died in 1854 after spending 30 years unsuccessfully digging for it. Just before he died, he told Stephen Bouchette of the treasure. That same year, news of Yount's promising sample began to circulate. Bouchette staked a claim and announced he had found a rich vein. He secured generous backing and spent more than $10,000 for extensive tunnels stretching over 800 feet. Some believe that there was little, if any, gold and that the claim was a ruse to get loans to dig for the lost treasure. In 1878, he and his wife loaded all they could onto a sailboat and were never seen again. Experts are still unable to determine if they found the buried treasure, were lost at sea, or simply returned to the mainland. Word of Yount's promising samples, combined with Bouchette's well-funded claim, brought hopeful miners, and, by 1863, boom towns briefly dotted the hills. In less than one year, 10,000 feet of claims were registered, and 70 miners were actively mining these claims. Tunnels were dug by hand, and miners camped out with only one store and saloon to supply their needs. Challenged by hardship, they did enjoy the convenience of homing pigeons that delivered messages to the mainland in 45 minutes, while mail took 10 days. In 1864, the United States federal government, fearing attempts to outfit privateers by Confederate sympathizers in the American Civil War, ended the mining by ordering everyone off the island. A small garrison of Union troops was stationed at the Isthmus on the island's west end for about nine months. Their barracks stand as the oldest structure on the island and are currently the home of the Isthmus Yacht Club. Although evidence of gold on Catalina is inconclusive, the promise of a gold-rich bonanza fueled speculation for the next few decades. Early developers (1860–1919) In the 1860s, German immigrant Augustus William Timms ran a sheep herding business on Catalina Island. One of his vessels, the Rosita, would also ferry pleasure seekers across the channel to Avalon Bay for bathing and fishing. The settlement in Avalon was then referred to as Timms' Landing in his honor. By the summer of 1883, there were thirty tents and three wooden buildings at Timms' Landing. Tourists enjoying the waters off Catalina in 1889 The Island Mountain Railway at Avalon on Santa Catalina Island was an incline cable railway on the side of a hill. It operated from 1904–1918. By the end of the 19th century, the island was almost uninhabited except for a few cattle herders. At that time, its location just from Los Angeles—a city that had reached the population of 50,000 in 1890 and was undergoing a period of enormous growth—was a major factor that contributed to the development of the island into a vacation destination. The first owner to try to develop Avalon into a resort destination was George Shatto, a real estate speculator from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Shatto purchased the island for $200,000 from the Lick estate at the height of the real estate boom in Southern California in 1887. Shatto created the settlement that would become Avalon, and can be credited with building the town's first hotel, the original Hotel Metropole, and pier. Though early maps labeled the town Shatto, Shatto's sister-in-law Etta Whitney came up with the permanent name of Avalon. This name was pulled as a reference from a poem by Lord Tennyson called \\"Idylls of the King\\" about the legend of King Arthur. Shatto laid out Avalon's streets, and introduced it as a vacation destination to the general public. He did this by hosting a real estate auction in Avalon in 1887, and purchasing a steamer ship for daily access to the island. In the summer of 1888, the small pioneer village kicked off its opening season as a booming little resort town. Despite Shatto's efforts, in a few years he had to default on his loan and the island went back to the Lick estate. Avalon's oldest remaining structure, the distinctive Holly Hill House, was built on a lot purchased from Shatto and his agent C.A. Summer for $500 in 1888. Peter Gano, the engineer who built Catalina's first freshwater system, built it by himself, hauling material he had brought on his boat up the hill with the help of an old circus horse, Mercury. When it was complete in 1889, he asked the woman he loved to join him. As she refused to move to an island, he remained there alone. Restored after a fire in 1964, it is a well-known Avalon landmark. Captain Banning driving first stage on Santa Catalina Island, ca.1895–1900The sons of Phineas Banning bought the island in 1891 from the estate of James Lick and established the Santa Catalina Island Company to develop it as a resort. They had a variety of reasons for doing this. They wanted Catalina's rock to build a breakwater at Wilmington for their shipping company. They had also just built a luxurious new boat, the Hermosa, to bring tourists to the Island. If tourism failed, this investment was at risk. By owning Catalina, they would not only get their rock, but also money from tourists for their passage as well as everything on the island. The Banning brothers fulfilled Shatto's dream of making Avalon a resort community with the construction of numerous tourist facilities. They built a dance pavilion in the center of town, made additions to the Hotel Metropole and steamer-wharf, built an aquarium, and created the Pilgrim Club (a gambling club for men only). Although the Bannings' main focus was in Avalon, they also showed great interest in the rest of the island and wanted to introduce other parts of Catalina to the general public. They did this by paving the first dirt roads into the island's interior, where they built hunting lodges and led stagecoach tours, and by making Avalon's surrounding areas (Lovers Cove, Sugarloaf Point and Descanso Beach) accessible to tourists. They built two homes, one in Descanso Canyon and the other in what is now Two Harbors, the latter now being that village's only hotel. Just as the Bannings were anticipating the construction of a new, Hotel Saint Catherine, their efforts were set back on November 29, 1915, when a fire burned half of Avalon's buildings, including six hotels and several clubs. The Bannings refused to sell the island in hopes of rebuilding the town, starting with the Hotel Saint Catherine. The hotel would be located on Sugarloaf Point, the unique, picturesque, cliff bound peninsula at the north end of Avalon's harbor. It was blasted away to begin the construction of the hotel with its annex being in Descanso Canyon. These plans failed due to lack of funding and, in the end, the hotel was built in Descanso Canyon. In 1919, due to debt related to the 1915 fire and a general decline tourism during World War I, the Bannings were forced to sell the island in shares. Wrigley ownership (1919–1975) William Wrigley, Jr. took control of Avalon in 1919 One of the main investors to purchase shares from the Bannings was chewing-gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr. Preceding his purchase, he traveled to Catalina with his wife, Ada, and son, Philip. Reportedly, Wrigley immediately fell in love with the island and, in 1919, bought out nearly every share-holder until he owned controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Company. Wrigley devoted himself to preserving and promoting the island, investing millions in needed infrastructure and attractions. Wrigley built a home overlooking Avalon on Mount Ada, named after his wife, so he could oversee his work. When Wrigley bought the island, the Hermosa II and the were the only steamships that provided access to the island. In order to encourage growth, Wrigley purchased an additional steamship, the SS Virginia. With some adjustments, it was renamed the SS Avalon. He also foresaw the design of another steamship, the which was launched on the morning of May 3, 1924. These steamships would deliver passengers to Catalina for many years. One of Wrigley's first priorities was to create a new and improved dance pavilion for the island's tourists. Wrigley used Sugarloaf Point, which had originally been cleared for construction by the Banning Brothers, to build the dance hall which he named Sugarloaf Casino. It served as a ballroom and Avalon's first high-school. Its time as a casino was short, however, for it proved too small for Catalina's growing population. In 1928, the Casino was razed to make room for a newer Casino. Sugarloaf Rock was blasted away to enhance the Casino's ocean-view. On May 29, 1929, Wrigley completed the new Catalina Casino, built in the Art Deco style. The lower level of the Casino houses the Avalon Theater. The upper-level houses the world's largest circular ballroom with a diameter dance floor. Throughout the 1930s the Casino Ballroom hosted many of the biggest names in entertainment, including Benny Goodman, Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, and Gene Autry. Wrigley also sought to bring publicity to the island through events and spectacles. Starting in 1921, the Chicago Cubs, also owned by Wrigley, used the island for the team's spring training. Players stayed at the Hotel St. Catherine in Descanso Bay and played on a ballfield built in Avalon Canyon. The Cubs continued to use the island for spring training until 1951, except during the war years of 1942–45. In another effort to bring publicity to the island, Wrigley established the Wrigley Ocean Marathon on January 15, 1927, offering a reward to the first person to swim across the channel from the mainland. The award was won by Canadian swimmer George Young, the only finisher. Following the death of Wrigley, Jr. in 1932, control of the Santa Catalina Island Company passed down to his son, Philip K. Wrigley, who continued his father's work improving the infrastructure of the island. Philip continued his father's work in the improvement of the infrastructure of the City of Avalon. During World War II, the island was closed to tourists and used for military training facilities. Catalina's steamships were expropriated for use as troop transports and a number of military camps were established. The U.S. Maritime Service set up a training facility in Avalon, the Coast Guard had training at Two Harbors, the Army Signal Corp maintained a radar station in the interior, the Office of Strategic Services did training at Toyon Bay, and the Navy did underwater demolition training at Emerald Bay. In September 1972, 26 members of the Brown Berets, a group of Chicano activists, traveled to Catalina and planted a Mexican flag, claiming the island for all Chicanos. They asserted that the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty between Mexico and the United States did not specifically mention the Channel Islands. The group camped above the Chimes Tower on the point above the Casino near Avalon and were viewed as a new tourist attraction. Local Mexican-Americans provided them with food after they used up their own supplies. After 24 days a municipal judge visited the camp to ask them to leave. They departed peaceably on the tourist boat, just as they had arrived. On February 15, 1975, Philip Wrigley deeded 42,135 acres of the island from the Santa Catalina Island Company to the Catalina Island Conservancy that he had helped to establish in 1972. This gave the Conservancy control of nearly 90 percent of the island. The balance of the Santa Catalina Island Company that was not deeded to the Conservancy maintains control of much of its resort properties and operations on the island. It owns and operates many of the main tourist attractions in Avalon, including the Catalina Visitors Country Club, Catalina Island Golf Course, Descanso Beach Club and the Casino Ballroom. Recent history (1975–present) Actress Natalie Wood drowned in the waters near the settlement of Two Harbors under questionable circumstances over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in 1981. Wood and her husband, Robert Wagner, were vacationing aboard their motor yacht, Splendour, along with their guest, Christopher Walken, and Splendour captain, Dennis Davern. In 2011, thirty years after the actress' death, the case was reopened, partially due to public statements made by Davern. Catalina Island Interior In May 2007, Catalina experienced the 2007 Avalon Fire. Greatly due to the assistance of 200 Los Angeles County fire fighters transported by U.S. Marine Corps helicopters and U.S Navy hovercraft, only a few structures were destroyed, yet of wildland burned.Sahagun, L. and S. Quinones. 2007. Catalina fire lays siege to Avalon: Hundreds of residents and tourists are forced to flee the island. Los Angeles Times. 11 May. In May 2011, another wildfire started near the Isthmus Yacht Club and was fought by 120 firefighters transported by barge from Los Angeles. It was extinguished the next day after burning . In February 2011, water regulators cited the city for letting tens of thousands of gallons of sewage reach the ocean in six spills since 2005. A report in June 2011 by the Natural Resources Defense Council listed Avalon as having one of the 10 most chronically polluted beaches in the United States. The pollution was caused by the city's sewer system, made of century-old clay and metal pipes. By 2011, city had spent $3.5 million testing and rehabilitating sewer lines, but the water was no cleaner. In February 2012, a cease and desist order was issued against the City for illegally discharging polluted water into the bay. After the cease and desist order, the city invested an additional $5.7 million on sewer main improvements and inspection and tracking systems. As a result of these efforts, the 2014 report showed that water quality had improved, and Avalon Beach was removed from the list of the most polluted beaches. In 2014, the Santa Catalina Island Company was working on a number of redevelopment and remodeling projects, including a spa, aquatic facility, community center, new hotel, and 120 new homes. The largest project was a new $6-million museum building on Metropole Street to replace the old location in the Casino building. Some community members, including a then-member of the City Council, expressed concerns about the pace of the changes to the town. On November 7, 2019, the Santa Catalina Island Company permanently shuttered the Casino Movie Theater. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the island was closed to tourists.

After his defeat, his general Li Tai (李台) arrested him and delivered him to the Southern Tang army to be executed.  Rebellion against Southern Han  Little is known about Zhang Yuxian's background. What is known that he served as a minor official at the county government of Boluo County (博羅, in modern Huizhou, Guangdong) when, in an incident not well-explained in the written history, a god was said to have descended to the household at Keshan Township (刻杉鎮) in Boluo County, and the god, which was not visible to humans but was speaking out loud, was making many prophecies about the future. Zhang went to pray to the god and he remained there, serving the god fervently.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. As of 942, Southern Han was ruled by the emperor Liu Bin. There were many groups of bandits in Xun Prefecture (循州, in modern Huizhou). The bandits, who were disorganized but wanted greater organization, went to pray to the god. The god responded, \\"Zhang Yuxian should be your lord.\\" The bandit leaders thereafter supported Zhang to lead the overall movement, and he took the title of \\"King of the Eight Kingdoms of Middle Heaven\\" and established a government. His army attacked the coastal region and took much of the territory. However, it was said that he himself was young and lacked strategies. He took reports from the generals but had little direction for them. Liu Bin reacted by sending his brothers Liu Hongchang the Prince of Yue and Liu Honggao the Prince of Xun to command an army against Zhang. However, Zhang's army defeated them and surrounded them. Only through the efforts of the officer Chen Daoxiang (陳道庠) were the two princes able to escape. Most of Southern Han's eastern prefectures fell to Zhang, including Xun. However, in summer 943, the Han general Wan Jingxin (萬景忻) defeated Zhang's army at Xun.  Campaign against Southern Tang  After the defeat by Wan Jingxin, Zhang Yuxian prayed to the god to ask what to do next. The god replied, \\"Capture Qian Prefecture [(虔州, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi, then ruled by Southern Tang)], and you will accomplish great things. Zhang thereafter led his followers over the Nan Mountains and headed for Qian. Southern Tang's military governor of Baisheng Circuit (百勝, headquartered at Qian), Jia Kuanghao (賈匡浩), did not anticipate this happening and was not prepared. Zhang, whose followers were said to be over 100,000 by this point, captured many counties of Qian Prefecture and defeated its army, such that Jia was forced to close its gates to defend it. Zhang set up his headquarters at Baiyun Cave (白雲洞, in modern Ganzhou) and built a palace and government buildings; from there, he sent his army out to raid the surroundings. The Southern Tang emperor Li Jing sent the officer Yan En (嚴恩) to lead an army against Zhang, with the official Bian Hao serving as Yan's army monitor. Bian, under the advice of his strategist Bai Changyu (白昌裕), was successful against Zhang. Zhang again prayed to the god, but the god no longer answered, causing much panic among his followers. Under Bai's advice, Bian opened up a road through the forest and attacked Zhang from the rear. Zhang abandoned his army and fled to his general Li Tai. Li, realizing that the god was no longer speaking to Zhang, instead arrested Zhang and surrendered him to the Southern Tang army. Zhang was taken to Southern Tang's capital Jinling and executed there.  Notes and references  * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 66. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283.

It was built from 1918 to . It is also known as One-Tree-Hill. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  Mount Coot- tha is part of the Taylor Range which forms a backdrop of hills to the City of Brisbane, and is the best known vantage point from which to view the city and surrounds. Mount Coot-tha was previously known as One-Tree-Hill, a reference to when the hill terminated in a bare knoll with a solitary large tree at the summit. The Taylor Range was originally named Glenmorrison Range by the explorer John Oxley in 1823. In July 1828, this range was referred to as Glenmoriston's Range and Sir Herbert Taylor's Range by the colonial botanist Charles Fraser, and as Glenmorriston's Range by Captain Patrick Logan, Commandant of the penal settlement at Brisbane. The first recorded ascent by European explorers was on 6 July 1828, with Fraser, Captain Patrick Logan and explorer Allan Cunningham. Fraser's journal describes in detail the species of trees found there, and that the view from the south-east to north-west was extensive and very grand, presenting an immense thinly wooded plain, whose surface was gently undulated, and clothed with luxuriant grass. A request to purchase One-Tree-Hill in 1865 was refused, and the Surveyor-General replied that it would be required for trigonometrical purposes, and was moreover a point to which inhabitants of this city frequently repaired for recreation on account of the extensive view and fresh air. The Taylor Range provided a source of good timber and One-Tree-Hill was first proclaimed a reserve for railway purposes on 21 February 1873 in order that the source of timber could be secured for development of the railway from Ipswich to Brisbane. In 1880, One-Tree-Hill, together with the surrounding area of , was placed in charge of a body of Trustees as a reserve for public recreation. It was at this time that the name was changed to Mount Coot-tha. Mr HW Radford, Clerk of the Parliament, and Honorary Secretary to the Trustees of the Public Recreation Reserve, questioned a descendant of earlier members of the aboriginal tribe that frequented that area and discovered that the aboriginal name for the area was Coot-tha or Kuta, the aboriginal name for honey or the place of honey. Hence the name change to its official title of Mount Coot-tha. The summit was accessed by walking tracks, and by the 1870s some visitors were driving up with horse and carriages. When Mount Coot-tha became a reserve for public recreation, the track was improved to become a steep and windy road. The surviving one-tree was surrounded by a protective fence and in 1886 a shelter shed and water tank was built. Mount Coot-tha was proclaimed a reserve for native birds on 20 December 1890. The Saturday half-holiday was legislated for in Queensland as part of the 1900 Factory Act. The half-holiday was the beginning of the weekend as an institution, and together with public holidays the popularity of recreation areas and activities increased. With the advent of the motor car, motoring itself became a recreation activity. By 1918 it could be asserted that the steep rough bridle tracks of years ago were replaced with well-made roads and paths so that pedestrians and motorists could attain the highest points of Mount Coot-tha with the utmost ease. This road later became Sir Samuel Griffith Drive. In 1918 the Trustees of the Reserve requested that the Greater Brisbane Council take over the administration of the area and at this time it is believed that a new kiosk was built next to the existing shelter shed. = The Kiosk = Mount Coot-tha Kiosk, 2011 The first recorded shelter shed at Mount Coot-tha appears to have been an open sided timber structure and water tank. In May 1886, the Courier reported the completion of the shed, stating the site selected not being unduly exposed, whilst commanding the favourite outlook. Tables, forms, and tanks are all fixed up and the fireplaces are in progress, and as soon as a rainfall gives a supply of water, picnicking parties can avail themselves of all the conveniences provided. The wife of the caretaker of the reserve, who lived in a house about a quarter of a mile below the summit, operated a small kiosk where teas were served to visitors. A small timber kitchen had been built adjacent to the shelter shed by c.1912. A larger open sided kiosk was constructed on the northeast side of the shelter shed c.1918, and this kiosk forms the basis of the present structure. A 1928 plan by Alfred Herbert Foster, Brisbane City Architect 1925-32, shows the position of the shelter shed and adjacent open sided kiosk, and indicates that the small kitchen may have been relocated to form a detached kitchen wing serving the kiosk. A 1928 design signed by Reyburn Jameson, Brisbane City Assistant Architect 1926-29, repeated the plan form of the existing kiosk to double its size and provide for a two-storeyed timber extension to the northwest to accommodate living quarters. The shelter shed and small kitchen were demolished, the prominent fleche and chimney were added, and the roof resheeted with red fibro cement tiles. The open balustrade nature of the kiosk changed at this time, with the inclusion of sliding multi-paned timber sashes above hand rail level and a fibro cement balustrade below. The enlarged kiosk reflected the increasing popularity and visitor numbers to Mount Coot-tha, and the proliferation of motor transport. A 1949 design by Brisbane City Architect Frank Gibson Costello shows extensions and alterations to the kitchen and caretakers wing with the annotation town water supply to be extended to high level tank located in a suitable position having in mind the future development of this site. Further work was carried out in 1950, with a design by Costello in May showing a circular drive, new entrance, lounge and lavatories, and later that year extensions to the living quarters and the construction of a high-level timber tankstand. The present terra-cotta roof tiles date from post 1950. As City Architect, Costello also designed the adjoining lookout and raised viewing platform which are typical of the quality of his work for the council, which included the sub-stations at Hamilton, Ashgrove and Newmarket, and the Eagle Farm Pumping Station. More recently, some internal partitioning has occurred and an entrance pergola and signage have been constructed. = The Lookout = Mount Coot-tha Lookout, 1930 Looking at the view has been the most popular and continuing form of recreation on Mount Coot-tha, and in 1882 the Duke of Clarence and Prince George (later King George V) commemorated their visit to Mount Coot-tha by planting two Moreton Bay Fig trees on the summit. By 1902 the viewing spot had been formalised by the erection of a stone pillar topped with a metal plate engraved with directional lines pointing to distant landmarks and views. There were also protective railings and a pay-as-you-look telescope. Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York enjoy a morning at Mt. Coot-tha April 1927 A small viewing gazebo with an ogee shaped roof, stone base, open balustrades, pergola entrance, and housing a telescope was constructed c.1918. In 1927 the Duke and Duchess of York were photographed visiting Mount Coot-tha standing at the direction finder. A 1950 design by City Architect Frank Gibson Costello shows a raised viewing platform with a concrete canopy on a stone base, with a large radiating lookout platform above a stone retaining wall. The stand of trees at the summit were cleared for the construction of the lookout platform. The 1950 scheme showed a drinking fountain in place of the current direction finder, and a direction finder located on the raised viewing platform.  Description  The Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Kiosk are located at the summit of Mount Coot-tha fronting Sir Samuel Griffith Drive to the southeast. The Kiosk The kiosk, located to the north of the lookout, is a single-storeyed timber building on a stone base with a terra-cotta tiled gable and half-gable roof. The roof has a prominent central fleche ventilator, terra-cotta finials and chimney pots, and half- timbered gables. The building has evolved from an open sided kiosk, and the main section is formed by two adjoining similar kiosk structures, with a two- storeyed service wing to the rear and an addition to the northeast. The kiosk section has sliding multi-paned sash windows which can be concealed within the solid balustrade below, and multi-paned fanlight glazing above. The balustrade has fibrous cement panels with timber mouldings. The service wing and northeast addition have weatherboard cladding, with a brick base to the northeast. A tall timber framed tankstand is located to the north of the building. The Lookout The lookout is located at southern and highest end of the site, with views from the south to the northeast. It consists of a large radiating lookout platform above a porphyry stone retaining wall, surrounded by metal balustrading with a raised viewing platform at the southern end. The octagonal raised viewing platform is located on a stepped base of concentric paths and garden beds with porphyry stone retaining walls. The platform has a terrazzo floor with an inlaid brass star pattern and a concrete canopy supported on steel posts. A carpark is located to the west of the lookout. Mount Coot-tha Lookout, 2011  Heritage listing  Mount Coot-tha Lookout & Kiosk was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Kiosk site has been recognised as the best vantage point from which to view the surrounding area since the first recorded European ascent in 1828. Since this time, the growing popularity of visiting the summit has reflected the emergence of leisure and recreation time for the general populace, and the advent and popularity of the motor car. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Kiosk is important as a building which has evolved to meet the changing requirements of use, but has retained the integrity and character of the original structure. The evolution of the Kiosk is displayed in its cohesive and legible form, with the c.1918 structure forming the basis of the present building. The Lookout is representative of a 1950s interpretation of the functionalist idiom. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Both structures are representative of the high quality of civic architecture produced by the Brisbane City Council Works Department and of the City Architect.

This technique builds on the principle of electrowetting, which has proven useful in liquid actuation due to fast switching response times and low power consumption. Where traditional electrowetting runs into challenges, however, such as in the simultaneous manipulation of multiple droplets, OEW presents a lucrative alternative that is both simpler and cheaper to produce. OEW surfaces are easy to fabricate, since they require no lithography, and have real-time, reconfigurable, large- scale manipulation control, due to its reaction to light intensity.  Theory  The traditional electrowetting mechanism has been receiving increasing interest due to its ability to control tension forces on a liquid droplet. As surface tension acts as the dominant liquid actuation force in nano-scale applications, electrowetting has been used to modify this tension at the solid-liquid interface through the application of an external voltage. The applied electric field causes a change in the contact angle of the liquid droplet, and in turn changes the surface tensions across the droplet. Precise manipulation of the electric field allows control of the droplets. The droplet is placed on an insulating substrate located in between an electrode. Optoelectrowetting against traditional electrowetting diagram The optoelectrowetting mechanism adds a photoconductor underneath the conventional electrowetting circuit, with an AC power source attached. Under normal (dark) conditions, the majority of the system's impedance lies in the photoconducting region, and therefore the majority of the voltage drop occurs here. However, when light is shined on the system, carrier generation and recombination causes the conductivity of the photoconductor spikes and results in a voltage drop across the insulating layer, changing the contact angle as a function of the voltage. The contact angle between a liquid and electrode can be described as:Need citation : \\\\cos\\\\big(\\\\theta(V_A)\\\\big) = \\\\cos\\\\big(\\\\theta(0)\\\\big) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{d \\\\gamma_{LV}}\\\\right)V_A^2 \\\\, where VA, d, ε, and γLV are applied voltage, thickness of the insulation layer, dielectric constant of the insulation layer, and the interfacial tension constant between liquid and gas. In AC situations, such as OEW, VA is replaced with the RMS voltage. The frequency of the AC power source is adjusted so that the impedance of the photoconductor dominates in the dark state. The shift in the voltage drop across the insulating layer therefore reduces the contact angle of the droplet as a function of the light intensity. By shining an optical beam on one edge of a liquid droplet, the reduced contact angle creates a pressure difference throughout the droplet, and pushes the droplet's center of mass towards the illuminated side. Control of the optical beam results in control of the droplet's movement. Using 4 mW laser beams, OEW has proven to move droplets of deionized water at speeds of 7mm/s. Traditional electrowetting runs into problems because it requires a two-dimensional array of electrodes for droplet actuation. The large number of electrodes leads to complexity for both control and packaging of these chips, especially for droplet sizes of smaller scales. While this problem can be solved through integration of electronic decoders, the cost of the chip would significantly increase. Single-sided continuous optoelectrowetting (SCOEW) Droplet manipulation in electrowetting-based devices are usually accomplished using two parallel plates which sandwiches the droplet and is actuated by digital electrodes. The minimum droplet size that can be manipulated is determined by the size of pixilated electrodes. This mechanism provides a solution to the size limitation of physical pixilated electrodes by utilizing dynamic and reconfigurable optical patterns and enables operations such as continuous transport, splitting, merging, and mixing of droplets. SCOEW is conducted on open, featureless, and photoconductive surfaces. This configuration creates a flexible interface that allows simple integration with other microfluidic components, such as sample reservoirs through simple tubing. It is also known as open optoelectrowetting (O-OEW). Optoelectrowetting using a photocapacitance Optoelectrowetting can also be achieved using the photocapacitance in a liquid-insulator-semiconductor junction. The photo- sensitive electrowetting is achieved via optical modulation of carriers in the space charge region at the insulator-semiconductor junction which acts as a photodiode – similar to a charge-coupled device based on a metal-oxide- semiconductor. Types of applications =Clinical diagnostics= Electrowetting presents a solution to one of the most challenging tasks in lab-on-a-chip systems in its ability to handle and manipulate complete physiological compounds. Conventional microfluidic systems aren't easily adaptable to handle different compounds, requiring reconfiguration that often results in the device being impractical as a whole. Through OEW, a chip with one power source can be readily used with a variety of substances, with potential for multiplexed detection. =Optical actuation= Photoactuation in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has been demonstrated in proof-of- concept experiments. Instead of a typical substrate, a specialized cantilever is placed on top of the liquid-insulator-photoconductor stack. As light is shined on the photoconductor, the capillary force from the drop on the cantilever changes with the contact angle, and deflects the beam. This wireless actuation can be used as a substitute for complex circuit-based systems currently used for optical addressing and control of autonomous wireless sensors See also * photoelectrowetting References External links * Demonstration of SCOEW on a lab-on-a-chip * O-OEW droplet acutation testing at Purdue University Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Nanotechnology Category:Biotechnology ","title":"Optoelectrowetting"},{"id":"44524546","text":"The Glass Castle is a 2017 American biographical drama film directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and written by Cretton, Andrew Lanham, and Marti Noxon.

They praised the performances of its cast, particularly Larson, but criticized the emotional tones and adaptation. The film grossed $22 million in North America. Plot As a child, Jeannette Walls lives a nomadic life with her painter mother Rose, her intelligent but irresponsible father Rex, older sister Lori, and younger brother Brian. While cooking unsupervised, Jeannette is severely burned. At the hospital, a doctor and social worker question her home life, but Rex distracts the staff and escapes with Jeannette. The family leaves town, and Jeannette is enchanted by Rex’s plans for the family’s dream house, a glass castle. The family soon includes Jeannette’s infant sister Maureen, and remains on the move for years, eventually relocating to a dilapidated house in Utah. Jeannette nearly drowns when a drunk Rex aggressively teaches her to swim. He assaults the lifeguard, forcing the family – now pursued by the law and with no money – to go to Welch, West Virginia, where the children meet their grandparents and uncle Stanley. Rex moves his family into a ramshackle house in the wilderness, living without running water, gas, or electricity. When the family has not eaten in days, Rex takes their remaining money to buy food, but returns home drunk after a fight. Sewing up his wound, Jeannette asks him to stop drinking, and Rex ties himself to his bed, successfully enduring withdrawal. He lands a job as a construction worker and the family enjoys a comfortable Christmas. The parents attend the funeral of Rose’s mother in Texas, leaving the children with their grandparents in Welch. The sisters discover Irma sexually assaulting Brian and attack her, but are pulled away by Stanley. When their parents return, Rex refuses to listen to his children about the incident. The family returns home and he resumes drinking, leading to a violent altercation with Rose. Jeannette is unable to convince her mother to leave Rex, and the siblings promise to care for each other and escape their poverty. As a teenager, Jeannette is drawn to journalism. The siblings save enough money for Lori to leave for New York City, infuriating Rex; Jeannette prepares to do the same. Irma dies, and after the funeral, Jeannette is pulled into her father’s scheme to hustle his acquaintance Robbie at pool. He loses to Rex and reveals Jeannette’s plan to move to New York City. She accompanies Robbie upstairs and he attempts to rape her, but she shows her scars from her childhood burns and leaves. At home, she discovers her father has stolen her savings, but escapes home anyway. Attending college in New York City, Jeannette faces financial difficulties and prepares to drop out, but Rex arrives with a pile of gambling winnings, telling her to follow her dreams. By 1989, Jeannette is a gossip columnist for New York magazine and engaged to marry David, a financial analyst. At dinner with a client of David’s, Jeannette lies about her parents. On the way home, she sees her now homeless parents dumpster diving. She later meets with her mother, who is dismissive of her engagement. Jeannette and David visit her family at the abandoned building where her parents are squatting. Brian, now a police officer, and Lori live comfortably, but Maureen has moved in with their parents. Rex and David drunkenly arm wrestle and David wins, but Rex punches him in the nose. Returning home, David tells Jeannette that he wants nothing more to do with her parents. Maureen calls Jeannette to explain that she is moving to California. At her engagement party, Jeannette discovers that her parents have owned valuable land – now worth almost $1 million – since she was a child, but chose never to sell. Furious at Rex’s refusal to admit to the pain he caused his family, Jeannette bans him from her life. Some time later, Jeannette is unhappily married to David. Rose reaches out to tell her Rex is dying, but Jeannette refuses to see him. At dinner with another of David’s clients, Jeannette finds the courage to reveal the truth about her parents. She races to her father, and they reconcile before he dies. The following Thanksgiving, Jeannette – now a freelance writer living alone – celebrates with her family, reminiscing about Rex’s unconventional life.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A−\\" on an A+ to F scale. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers said the film \\"peddles easy uplift instead of cold, hard truths\\" and gave it two stars out of four, saying, \\"Hollywood has a knack for sanitizing books that deserve better. In the case of The Glass Castle, it's a damn shame.\\" Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times also gave the film two out of four stars and was equally critical for its presentation, writing: \\"...a film that presents overwhelming evidence of Rex and Rose Mary as appalling human beings for 90 percent of the journey, and then asks us to give them a break? No sale.\\" References External links * Category:American films Category:Films about journalists Category:Films about writers Category:Films based on American novels Category:Biographical films about journalists Category:Biographical films about writers Category:American biographical drama films Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:2017 biographical drama films Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films directed by Destin Daniel Cretton Category:Films shot in West Virginia Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Squatting in film Category:2017 drama films ","title":"The Glass Castle (2017 film)"},{"id":"44524566","text":"Barbara Bond (born August 9, 1962) is an American former rugby union player.https://www.world.rugby/tournament/1110/teams/2583 She captained the at the first Women's Rugby World Cup in 1991.

David Hawk, chief of AXE, is asked by the head of British intelligence to assassinate Richard Philston – former head of MI6 who subsequently defected to Russia. It is rumored that Philston will venture out of Russia to organize a massive sabotage operation in Japan. Hawk suspects that the British government really wants Philston arrested and charged with treason but that Cecil Aubrey, current head of MI6, wants Philston murdered as revenge for Philston’s seduction of Aubrey's wife and her subsequent suicide. Meanwhile, Carter is kidnapped from his apartment by four young Japanese women (Tonaka, Kato, Sato, Mato). Tonaka is the daughter of Kunizo Matu - Carter's martial arts teacher and former Japanese secret service agent – who saved Carter's life in London many years ago. The women insist Carter come to Tokyo immediately. Upon arrival, Carter is given the identity of Pete Fremont, a drunken American journalist, and meets Kunizo Matu. Matu has recently contacted Cecil Aubrey about the presence of Richard Philston in Tokyo. He too is aware of Philston's plan to use Chinese communist infiltrators led by Johnny Chow to organize widespread sabotage in Japan. Matu asks for Carter's help to kill or capture Philston. Matu objects to the Chinese communists using Matu's discriminated underclass – the Eta or Burakumin – as scapegoats for sabotage plots by foreign powers. Before Matu can reveal Philston's location in Tokyo he is killed by an assassin. Carter gives chase but loses the gunman in the San'ya slums. Carter receives a parcel from Johnny Chow – a severed human breast which Carter assumes is Tonaka's. A note instructs Fremont to meet Johnny Chow in Ginza. Before he can get there, Carter (as Fremont) is picked up by minders and taken to a large house in the suburbs where he meets Philston. Philston requires the services of a journalist with wide connections. He will pay Fremont USD 50,000 (worth more than $340,000 in 2014)http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ to plant a story in the world's press. The Emperor of Japan is to be assassinated and Fremont is to ensure that Chinese communists are blamed. Philston sends Carter to meet Johnny Chow. Chow is unaware of the assassination plot. He thinks Fremont is being employed to plant stories about the Eta as the organisers of the sabotage plot. When he arrives at Chow’s base he finds Tonaka. She is unharmed and has been working with Chow. Tonaka reveals that she is a colonel in Chinese intelligence. She is a communist agitator working with Johnny Chow to encourage the Eta to overthrow the imperialist Japanese. Carter is taken to the basement of a dockside warehouse where he finds Kato dead inside a torture device similar to an iron maiden. Carter is handcuffed, drugged and left under guard. He reawakens 24 hours later and escapes by breaking his own hand to remove the handcuffs. He races to the Tokyo Imperial Palace to warn the Emperor. Johnny Chow and Tonaka are outside the palace grounds leading a mob to try to break into the palace while a citywide power outage takes place. Carter shoots Chow and Tonaka is killed when mounted police charge the rioting mob. Carter enters the grounds and finds his friend from the American embassy assisting the police. The embassy official tells Carter that the Emperor is not in residence today. He is at his personal shrine in Fujiyoshida. Philston has fooled everyone. Carter commandeers a car and drives to the shrine 30 miles away. Carter arrives at the shrine and stalks Philston among the grounds. Carter catches up with Philston just as he enters the shrine and finds the Emperor in prayer. Carter kills Philston with his knife. The Emperor thanks Carter and gives him a medallion as a token of thanks. Carter uses the Emperor's camera to take a photo of Philston.

She is portrayed by Zooey Deschanel. Conception and development Movie actress and singer-songwriter Zooey Deschanel was in the process of developing an HBO show when she read the New Girl pilot script and responded to the material. The character of Jess was not specifically written for Deschanel, but the producers found it a great match and did not need a lot of fine-tuning. With the support from Fox, Meriwether wanted to make Jess a unique, interesting and funny female character that would have been the side character on other shows. Deschanel became a producer on the show and helped build the character, requesting to not play the classic wife character who would be ignored by the guys she tries to keep out of trouble. Meriwether's goal was to write about herself from an honest perspective, with Jess mirroring her at the start and later Deschanel until Jess turned into a \\"hybrid of me and Zooey, the writers, and the editor\\". Deschanel described Jess as a part of her, especially in regards to \\"the sort of enthusiasm and optimism\\" of her youth. She does not shy away from playing embarrassing scenes or being unattractive, and Kasdan said that \\"This show advocates for the attractive dork.\\" Although Meriwether had always imagined the show as an ensemble show, Fox would later focus its first marketing push on Deschanel and gave the show the promotional tagline \\"Simply Adorkable.\\" Speaking of the show Zooey Deschanel claimed that her character in New Girl resembles a younger version of herself. She said \\"I think Jess as a person, and the way that her personality is, has some of myself and especially some of my younger self,\\" she suggested. \\"[She resembles] my 13-year-old self.\\" Deschanel added that Jess will explore her lost youth after she is dumped by her long-term boyfriend. \\"I have to find a new support system, so I'm basically living my 20s as I approach my 30s,\\" she explained. Character storyline Jess grew up in Portland, Oregon. Her parents, Bob (Rob Reiner) and Joan (Jamie Lee Curtis), are divorced, and she has an older sister named Abby (Linda Cardellini). Her best friend, Cece (Hannah Simone) moved to Los Angeles in their late teens/ early twenties and some time after, Jess followed her and got a job as a school teacher. She dated Spencer (Ian Wolterstorff), her boyfriend of six years, but discovered he had been cheating on her and left him. She answers an ad on Craigslist and moves into a loft she shares with Nick Miller (Jake Johnson), Coach (Damon Wayans Jr.) , and Schmidt (Max Greenfield). She mentions that since the breakup she would be watching Dirty Dancing on video repeatedly. She exhibits several quirks such as breaking into song or doing random impressions of television characters. She works as a sixth grade teacher, covering multiple subjects from science and art to sex education. She also plays guitar and writes songs, as shown in the episode \\"Bully\\". During season 1, she dates several different men, including: music teacher co-worker Paul Genzlinger (Justin Long), whom her roommates think is a male version of Jess; and Russell Schiller (Dermot Mulroney), a divorced father of one of her students. At the start of season 2, she is laid off from her school job. She hooks up with a guy named Sam Sweeney (David Walton) who prefers an open relationship and is later revealed to be a pediatrician. After trying some random part-time jobs such as a food server for a casserole shop, she gets a job in adult education where she teaches creative writing. Midway through the season, she and Nick are getting along when they spontaneously kiss in the episode \\"Cooler\\". Towards the end of season 2 she lands a job as a substitute teacher at Coolidge Middle School. She and Nick eventually have sex in \\"Virgins\\". After several episodes where they try to figure out what their relationship is, they agree to become a couple in the season 2 finale. In season 3, Jess continues her relationship with Nick, but after a tumultuous visit from Abby, she and Nick realize their life goals diverge too much and they have spent more time arguing, and break up in the season 3 episode \\"Mars Landing\\". She also struggles to fit in with the cool teachers at the school, but eventually befriends them, later becoming a vice-principal. In season 4, she gets in a relationship with Ryan Geauxinue (Julian Morris), a science teacher from England, but they struggle with a school policy that forbids administrator-teacher relationships. They break up after attempting a long- distance relationship. In season 5, Jess gets sequestered for jury duty, and is absent for several episodes in which Deschanel went on maternity leave. After returning, Jess starts dating Sam again. She becomes a vice-principal at another school. Towards the end of the season, Sam realizes he is in love with former schoolmate Diane, and breaks up with Jess, noting that Jess still harbors feelings for Nick. In season 6, Jess is part of a singles group, and develops a relationship with Robby McFerrin (Nelson Franklin), whom the rest of her roommates and friends like. In the episode \\"The Hike\\", when she and Robby learn that they share relatives in Connecticut, they realize they are third cousins, and thus end their relationship. She also becomes principal of the private school where she had taught. At the end of season 6, after Nick has broken up with Reagan (Megan Fox), she and Nick reunite as a couple. Three years later, in the season 7 premiere, Jess and Nick return to the loft after Nick's European book tour, where she sported a nose ring. They are still not engaged or married. Jess takes a job with Russell's company, and in the episode \\"Lillypads\\", it is revealed her circumstances from leaving the private school were complicated. On the night of a home visit to adopt a dog they were waiting two years for, Nick proposes to her, and she accepts. The night before the wedding, she and Nick sleep together but it leads to a series of unlucky circumstances and they marry in a hospital hall while Winston's wife Aly (Nasim Pedrad) is giving birth to their child. One month later, as she and Nick move to a smaller apartment, she has the entire gang bid their farewells to the loft by playing one last game of “True American“. During their game a brief flashforward reveals that she and Nick will eventually have a son. Reception Deschanel has received one Emmy and three Golden Globe nominations for her role on the show. She has also been nominated multiple times for Favorite Comedic TV Actress at the People's Choice Awards.

The Castro was one of the first gay neighborhoods in the United States. Having transformed from a working-class neighborhood through the 1960s and 1970s, the Castro remains one of the most prominent symbols of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activism and events in the world. Location San Francisco's gay village is mostly concentrated in the business district that is located on Castro Street from Market Street to 19th Street. It extends down Market Street toward Church Street and on both sides of the Castro neighborhood from Church Street to Eureka Street. Although the greater gay community was, and is, concentrated in the Castro, many gay people live in the surrounding residential areas bordered by Corona Heights, the Mission District, Noe Valley, Twin Peaks, and Haight-Ashbury neighborhoods. Some consider it to include Duboce Triangle and Dolores Heights, which both have a strong LGBT presence. Castro Street, which originates a few blocks north at the intersection of Divisadero and Waller Streets, runs south through Noe Valley, crossing the 24th Street business district and ending as a continuous street a few blocks farther south as it moves toward the Glen Park neighborhood. It reappears in several discontinuous sections before ultimately terminating at Chenery Street, in the heart of Glen Park. History Castro Street was named after José Castro (1808–1860), a Californian leader of Mexican opposition to U.S. rule in California in the 19th century, and alcalde of Alta California from 1835 to 1836. The neighborhood known as the Castro, in the district of Eureka Valley, was created in 1887 when the Market Street Railway Company built a line linking Eureka Valley to downtown. In 1891, Alfred E. Clarke built his mansion at the corner of Douglass and Caselli Avenue at 250 Douglass which is commonly referenced as the Caselli Mansion. It survived the 1906 earthquake and fire which destroyed a large portion of San Francisco. =Early years= Up to the 19th century, the areal possession of the Russian Empire in North America included the modern-day U.S. state of Alaska and settlements in the modern-day U.S. states of California (1 settlement) and Hawaii (3 settlements, starting in 1817). These Russian possessions were collectively and officially referred to by the name Russian America from 1733 to 1867. Formal incorporation of the possessions by Russia did not take place until the establishment of the Russian-American Company (RAC) in 1799. In 1809–1917, Finland was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire and was officially referred to as the Grand Duchy of Finland. During this era, the operations of both merchant and naval fleets as well as construction of naval vessels, relied heavily on Finnish know-how, seamen and officers. At the time, Russia was a relatively young naval power, gaining gradually access to the Baltic Sea only after the city of Saint Petersburg was founded on its coast in 1703, becoming officially part of Russia only at the end of the Great Northern War (1700–1721) in 1721.Maria Jarlsdotter Enckell, Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800–1867 . p. 108. In 1839, Sitka Lutheran Church, the first Protestant congregation on the west coast of the Americas and the first Lutheran congregation on the entire Pacific Rim was founded in Sitka, Alaska, by Finns who worked for the Russian-American Company. From the start, in 1840–1865, three consecutive Finnish pastors served this pastorate: Uno Cygnaeus (1840–1845), Gabriel Plathan (1845–1852) and Georg Gustaf Winter (1852–1865). The Finns Aaron Sjöstrom and Otto Reinhold Rehn served as the parish organists/sextons during this period.Maria Jarlsdotter Enckell, Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800–1867 . In 1841, under the governorship of Russian America by Finnish Arvid Adolf Etholén (1840–1845) (promoted to rear admiral in 1847), the Russian-American area of Fort Ross in Bodega Bay, California, was sold to Johann Sutter. On January 24, 1848, the first California gold was discovered on Sutter's land in Coloma, California, leading to the California Gold Rush, after news of this were spread abroad, mainly by the Finnish seamen in the service of the Russian-American Company. During the final three decades of the existence of Russian America, Finnish Chief Managers (\\"governors\\") of Russian America included Arvid Adolf Etholén (a.k.a. Etolin) in 1840–1845 and Johan Hampus Furuhjelm in 1859–1864.Etholén, Arvid Adolf (1798–1876) Chief Manager of Russian America in 1840–1845, rear admiral, explorer (in Finnish).Johan Hampus Furuhjelm Chief Manager of Russian America in 1859–1864, admiral, explorer (in Finnish). A third Finn, Johan Joachim von Bartram, declined the offer for the five-year term between 1850 and 1855.

In addition to Etholén, Furuhjelm and Niebaum, a number of Finns had become household names in the social circles of San Francisco by the time when the Finnish corvette Kalevala anchored in San Francisco on November 14, 1861. Accordingly, Kalevala's visit in the city received a very warm welcome and created much attention.M. J. Enckell, The Finnish migration to and from Russian Alaska and the Pacific Siberian Rim 1800–1900. Siirtolaisuus - Migration, April 2002. pp. 16–22. Turku, 2002. A festive dinner party arranged in honor of Admiral Popoff and the naval officers of the Russian Pacific Fleet visiting San Francisco in 1863. In 1863, a six-vessel Russian Imperial Navy squadron, a part of the Russian Pacific Fleet, sailed via Vladivostok to the West Coast of the United States, to help defend the waters there against a possible attack by the United Kingdom or France, during the American Civil War (April 12, 1861 – May 10, 1865).1863-1864 Russian Fleet Expedition to North America Latter Half of the 19th Century – The Ironclads – rusnavy.com In addition to the Finnish- built corvette Kalevala now returning to the U.S. West Coast, this squadron included three other corvettes, Bogatyr, Rynda and Novik (Russian: \\"Новик\\"), as well as two Finnish-built clippers, the sister-ships Abrek (Russian: \\"Абрек\\") and Vsadnik (Russian: \\"Всадник\\"), both built in the southwestern Finnish town of Pori and launched in 1860. Finnish officers serving in the squadron included Theodor Kristian Avellan, who later became the Minister of Naval Affairs of the Russian Empire (similar role to Great Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty).Avellan, Theodor Kristian, Finnish generals and admirals in the Russian Armed Forces, 1809–1917 (in Finnish). Among Finnish officers participating in the expedition were also Mr. Enqvist and Mr. Etholén (not Governor Etholén of Russian America). At the time when Finnish Sea Captain Gustave Niebaum, the founder of Inglenook Winery (1879) in Rutherford, California, was busy conducting business in the San Francisco Bay Area and Alaska – from the late 19th to the early 20th century –, both places had considerably large Finnish settlements. As the Governor of Russian America from 1858 to 1864, Finnish Johan Hampus Furuhjelm helped pave way for the American Alaska purchase, just like Gustave Niebaum did as the Consul of Russia for the United States in San Francisco in 1867 (at the time Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy of Russia), when Alaska became part of the United States of America. During his governorship of Russian America, Furuhjelm put an end to the hostilities involving groups of the native peoples of Alaska, and he succeeded in abolishing the Alaskan Ice Treaty with San Francisco. According to a contract which had been signed, Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price. The problem was that the product melted down on the way to the warmer climates. The ice contract became very awkward for the Russian colony. Furuhjelm arranged for a new contract to sell ice to San Francisco: 3,000 tons at $25.00 a ton. Officially registered Finnish Club No. 1 was established in the Castro District of San Francisco in 1882. Soon after, two \\"Finnish Halls\\" were erected nearby. One was located at the corner of 24th Street and Hoffman Street. The other hall was located on Flint Street, on the \\"Rocky Hill\\" above Castro, an area densely populated by Finns at the time, consequently nicknamed Finn Town. In 1899, the First Finnish Lutheran Church was founded on 50 Belcher Street, in what then was considered part of the Eureka Valley district of San Francisco, but what is located on the outskirts of what today is best known as the Castro District. Next to it, on September 17, 1905, the cornerstone was laid for the Danish St. Ansgar Church at 152 Church Street, between Market Street and Duboce Avenue. During the April 18, 1906, San Francisco earthquake and its aftermath, the parsonage served as a feeding station and hospital. In 1964, St. Ansgar merged with First Finnish Lutheran Church. The name for the united church, St. Francis Lutheran Church, was derived from San Francisco. Before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, nearly all the kids attending the McKinley school (now McKinley Elementary School) at 1025 14th Street (at Castro) were Finnish. Following the earthquake, a large number of Finns from San Francisco and elsewhere moved to Berkeley, where a Finnish community had been established already before the earthquake. A large part of the early Berkeley population was Finnish.Lutheran Church of the Cross . The brick and wood frame of the St. Francis Lutheran Church building survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and then was used for several months as an infirmary. Following the earthquake, the same year, Finns founded the Lutheran Church of the Cross in Berkeley, at University Avenue, where the Lutheran congregation still operates today.Lutheran Church of the Cross - homepage. In c. 1910, a bathhouse called Finnila's Finnish Baths began serving customers in the Castro District, at 9 Douglass Street. Its opening as an official business serving the general public took place in 1913. In 1919, the business moved to 4032 17th Street, a half block west from the busy Castro Street. In 1932, the business moved again, now to 2284 Market Street. In 1986, after having been stationed in the Castro District for over seven decades, the business moved the final time, now to 465 Taraval Street in the San Francisco's Sunset District, where it continued as Finnila's Health Club, serving women only.Edna Jeffrey Biography and synopsis of her novel, Till I'm with You Again. Despite public outcry and attempts to prevent the closing of the popular Finnila's Market Street bathhouse, the old bathhouse building was demolished by Alfred Finnila soon after the farewell party held in the end of December 1985. Today, the Finnila family owns the new Market & Noe Center building at the location of the old bathhouse, in the corner of Market and Noe Streets. =Change of character= From 1910 on, the Castro District of San Francisco and some of the surrounding areas was known by the term Little Scandinavia, because of the large number of the residents in the area originating from Finnish, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish ancestry. The 1943 novel Mama's Bank Account by Kathryn Forbes focused on a Norwegian family living in the area in the 1910s. Forbes' book served as the inspiration for John Van Druten's 1944 play I Remember Mama. The play was adapted to a Broadway theater production in 1944; to a movie in 1948; to a CBS Mama television series running from 1949 until 1957; to a Lux Radio Theater play in the late 1950s; and to a Broadway musical in 1979.\\"I Remember Mama, 1979\\" Internet Broadway Database listing, accessed March 24, 2012 \\"Mama's Bank Account\\" reflected a (then) Eureka Valley neighborhood, where for generations Norwegians worshiped at the Norwegian Lutheran Church at 19th and Dolores streets, and met for fraternal, social events, and Saturday night dances at Dovre Hall, 3543 18th Street, now the Women's Building. The Cove on Castro used to be called The Norse Cove at the time. The Scandinavian Seamen's Mission operated for a long time on 15th Street, off Market Street, just around the corner from the Swedish-American Hall, which remains in the district. In the 1920s – during prohibition – the downstairs of the Swedish- American Hall served as a speak-easy, one of many in the area. \\"Unlicensed saloons\\" were known as speak-easies, according to an 1889 newspaper. (A newspaper in Cheney, Washington) They were \\"so called because of the practice of speaking quietly about such a place in public, or when inside it, so as not to alert the police or neighbors\\". Scandinavian-style \\"half-timber\\" construction can still be seen in some of the buildings along Market Street, between Castro and Church Streets. A restaurant called Scandinavian Deli operated for decades on Market Street, between Noe and Sanchez Streets, almost directly across the street from Finnila's. Receiving an influx of Irish, Italian and other immigrants in the 1930s, the Castro gradually became an ethnically mixed working-class neighborhood, and it remained so until the mid-1960s. There was originally a cable car line with large double-ended cable cars that ran along Castro Street from Market Street to 29th St., until the tracks were dismantled in 1941 and the cable car line was replaced by the 24 MUNI bus. The Castro is at the end of the straight portion of the Market Street thoroughfare, and a mostly residential area follows Market Street as it curves and rises up and around the Twin Peaks mountains. =LGBT community= The U.S. military discharged thousands of gay servicemen from the Pacific theatre in San Francisco during World War II (early 1940s) because of their sexuality. Many settled in the Bay Area, San Francisco and Sausalito.Shilts, Randy. The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk, p. 51 In San Francisco, an established gay community had begun in numerous areas including Polk Street (which used to be regarded as the city's gay center from the 1950s to the early 1980s), the Tenderloin and South of Market. The 1950s saw large numbers of families moving out of the Castro to the suburbs in what became known as the \\"White flight\\", leaving open large amounts of real estate and creating attractive locations for gay purchasers. By 1963, the Castro's first gay bar was opened called the \\"Missouri Mule\\". The Castro's age as a gay mecca began during the late 1960s with the Summer of Love in the neighbouring Haight-Ashbury district in 1967. The two neighbourhoods are separated by a large mountain, topped by Buena Vista Park. The hippie and free love movements had fostered communal living and free society ideas including the housing of large groups of people in hippie communes. Androgyny became popular with men even in full beards as gay hippie men began to move into the area. The 1967 gathering brought tens of thousands of middle-class youth from all over the United States to the Haight which saw its own exodus when well-organized individuals and collectives started to see the Castro as an oasis from the massive influx. Many of the hippies had no way to support themselves or places to shelter. The Haight became drug-ridden and violent, chasing off the gay population, who looked for a more stable area to live. The gay community created an upscale, fashionable urban center in the Castro District in the 1970s. Many San Francisco gays also moved there in the years around 1970 from what was then the most prominent gay neighborhood, Polk Gulch, because large Victorian houses were available at low rents or available for purchase for low down payments when their former middle-class owners had fled to the suburbs. Harvey Milk, here with his sister-in-law in front of Castro Camera in 1973, had been changed by his experience with the counterculture of the 1960s. His store was used as his campaign headquarters and remains a tourist destination to date. By 1973, Harvey Milk, who would become the most famous resident of the neighborhood, opened a camera store, Castro Camera, and began political involvement as a gay activist, further contributing to the notion of the Castro as a gay destination. Some of the culture of the late 1970s included what was termed the \\"Castro clone\\", a mode of dress and personal grooming that exemplified butchness and masculinity of the working-class men in construction—tight denim jeans, black or sand combat boots, tight T-shirt or, often, an Izod crocodile shirt, possibly a red plaid flannel outer shirt, and usually sporting a mustache or full beard—in vogue with the gay male population at the time, and which gave rise to the nickname \\"Clone Canyon\\" for the stretch of Castro Street between 18th and Market Streets. There were numerous famous watering holes in the area contributing to the nightlife, including the Corner Grocery Bar, Toad Hall, the Pendulum, the Midnight Sun, Twin Peaks, and the Elephant Walk. A typical daytime street scene of the period is perhaps best illustrated by mentioning the male belly dancers who could be found holding forth in good weather at the corner of 18th and Castro on \\"Hibernia Beach\\", in front of the financial institution from which it drew its name. Then at night, after the bars closed at 2 AM, the men remaining at that hour often would line up along the sidewalk of 18th Street to indicate that they were still available to go home with someone (aka The Meat Rack). The area was heavily impacted by the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s. Beginning in 1984, city officials began a crackdown on bathhouses and launched initiatives that aimed to prevent the spread of AIDS. Kiosks lining Market Street and Castro Street now have posters promoting safe sex and testing right alongside those advertising online dating services. In 2019, San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Rafael Mandelman authored an ordinance to create the Castro LGBTQ Cultural District; the ordinance was passed unanimously.  Attractions  Rainbow flags, which are commonly associated with gay pride, are hung as banners on streetlights along the road.Shilts, Randy (1982).

One of the more notable features of the neighborhood is Castro Theatre, a movie palace built in 1922 and one of San Francisco's premier movie houses. 18th and Castro is a major intersection in the Castro, where many historic events, marches, and protests have taken and continue to take place. A major cultural destination in the neighborhood is the GLBT History Museum, which opened for previews on Dec. 10, 2010, at 4127 18th St. The grand opening of the museum took place on the evening of Jan. 13, 2011. The first full-scale, stand-alone museum of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history in the United States (and only the second in the world after the Schwules Museum in Berlin), the GLBT History Museum is a project of the GLBT Historical Society.Koskovich, Gerard (2011-01-11), \\"First GLBT History Museum in the United States opens in San Francisco's Castro district\\" ; posted on Dot429.com; retrieved 2011-01-14. The F Market heritage streetcar line turnaround at Market and 17th-streets where the Jane Warner city parklet sits. Across Castro street is the Harvey Milk Plaza in honor of its most famous resident with its iconic giant flag pole with an oversized rainbow flag, symbol of the LGBT community. Below street level is the main entrance to the Castro Street Station, a Muni Metro subway station and a multitiered park. Milk's camera store and campaign headquarters which were at 575 Castro has a memorial plaque and mural on the inside of the store, now housing the Human Rights Campaign Action Center and Store. There is a smaller mural above the sidewalk on the building showing Milk looking down on the street fondly. Across Market Street from Harvey Milk Plaza, and slightly up the hill, is the Pink Triangle Park – 17th Street at Market, a city park and monument named after the pink triangles forcibly worn by gay prisoners persecuted by the Nazis during World War II. Harvey's was formerly the Elephant Walk, raided by police after the White Night Riots. Twin Peaks is the first gay bar in the city, and possibly the United States, with plate glass windows to fully visibly expose patrons to the public is located at the intersection of Market and Castro. The Hartford Street Zen Center is also located in the Castro, as well as the Most Holy Redeemer Catholic Church, 100 Diamond Street. Special events, parade and street fairs that are held in the Castro include the Castro Street Fair, the Dyke March, the famed Halloween in the Castro which was discontinued in 2007 due to street violence, Pink Saturday discontinued in the Castro in 2016, and the San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival. A LGBTQ Walk of Fame, the Rainbow Honor Walk, was installed in August 2014 with an inaugural twenty sidewalk bronze plaques representing past LGBTQ icons in their field, who continue to serve as inspirations. The walk is originally planned to coincide with the business district of the Castro and eventually include 500 bronze plaques. The main business section of Castro St from Market to 19th street were under reconstruction and repaving in 2014 to address a number of neighborhood concerns. The area has heavy vehicular traffic as well as many visitors. As part of the work the sidewalks were widened and new trees were planted. Additionally 20 historical cement etchings covering from the inception to the area being settled to the 2010s sweeping gay marriage movement victories were installed in September 2014. =Castro Street History Walk= A separate sidewalk installation, the Castro Street History Walk (CSHW), is a series of twenty historical fact plaques about the neighborhood—ten from pre-1776 to the 1960s before the Castro became known as a gay neighborhood, and ten “significant events associated with the queer community in the Castro”—contained within the 400 and 500 blocks of the street between 19th and Market streets.Castro Street History Walk – Planet Castro They were installed at the same time as the inaugural twenty RHW plaques. The CSHW goes in chronological order starting at Harvey Milk Plaza at Market Street, up to 19th Street, and returning on the opposite side of Castro Street. The $10,000 CSHW was paid for by the Castro Business District (CBD) which “convened a group of local residents and historians to work with Nicholas Perry, a planner and urban designer at the San Francisco Planning Department who worked on the sidewalk-widening project and lives in the Castro” to develop the facts.Bay Area Reporter :: Online Extra: Political Notes: Meetings set to discuss Castro history project Each fact was required to be about the neighborhood or the surrounding Eureka Valley.

LGBT tourism Pride flag at the corner of Market, Castro, and 17th Street San Francisco has a large and thriving tourist economy due to ethnic and cultural communities such as Chinatown, North Beach, Haight-Ashbury and the Castro. The Castro is a site of economic success that brings in capital all year round with many events catered to the gay community along with everyday business. The Castro is a \\"thriving marketplace for all things gay\\" meaning everything in the area is catered to people who identify with LGBT culture and other associated meanings to the word gay. There are cafes, the Castro Theater, and many businesses that cater to or openly welcome LGBT consumers. These establishments make the Castro an area of high spending and lead to high tourist traffic. In addition to the city's locals, people travel to visit the shops and restaurants as well as the events that take place, such as the Castro Street Fair. Events such as the fairs drum up business for the community and bring in people from all over the nation who visit solely for the atmosphere the Castro provides. People who do not necessarily feel comfortable expressing themselves in their own community have the freedom to travel to places such as the Castro to escape the alienation and feel accepted. There is a sense of belonging and acceptance that is promoted throughout the district to accommodate non-heteronormative people that many LGBT travellers are attracted to. The Golden Gate Business Association (GGBA) was created in 1974 to help promote the Castro as a place for tourists, but also San Francisco and LGBT businesses as a whole. The GGBA sought to gain local political power and hoped to achieve their gains through an increase in gay tourism. This association formed the San Francisco Gay Tourism and Visitor's Bureau in 1983. Politically, the Bureau was neoliberal and focused on economic interests while denying poverty and prejudice. The LGBT tourism industry drives and benefits the economy due to the constant influx of consumers.

It is mainly distributed in central and southern China, but can also be found in some southeast Asian countries. The leaves and stems are used to make a herbal tea called \\"moyeam\\". The product has been popular in China for generations and is now consumed in some other countries . The English name \\"moyeam\\" comes from the Chinese name \\"茅岩莓\\" (Pinyin:máo yán méi). Most moyeam is grown in Zhangjiajie, a mountainous region in Hunan Province in central China. Plant features Moyeam germinates in the spring and fades in the autumn. There is no significant difference between its primary and secondary roots. Stems and leaves are glabrous, and stem diameter is about . The largest annual production is in early summer, followed by autumn. Average annual growth is . The dorsal leaves are gray in the spring. Leaflets are thin, papery, or herbaceous, long, narrow, oblong, oval or needle-shaped. Their margins are coarsely toothed. Young stems and leaves are light reddish purple. Production and processing The method of processing this plant was developed by the Tujia minority group 600 years ago. It involves plucking, withering, rolling, and fermenting the leaves. The fresh leaves should be withered within five hours to avoid oxidization and loss of nutrients. The rolling step produces its distinctive \\"white frost\\" color and enhances the flavor. Unoxidized \\"white\\" moyeam is also produced, but the more demanding production process for white moyeam (similar to the method by which green tea is produced) makes it more expensive than traditional moyeam. Its distinctive taste is slightly bitter with a strongly sweet aftertaste; the slightly grassy flavor is somewhat different from other common teas in China. Use In Tujia settlements, it is common to prepare this tea in a similar manner as green tea and drink it directly for a naturally sweet flavor. Nutritional values and chemical composition Moyeam is rich in flavonoids, primarily dihydromyricetin; the average level in this plant can reach 40%. It is becoming more popular with Chinese people, particularly among health-conscious consumers, due to its high level of flavonoids. It does not contain the antioxidant epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) found in green tea. Geographical environment Moyeam grows in Zhangjiajie's high mountains at 800-1500 m in elevation. The water, air and soil are isolated from contamination. The red sandstone soil is rich in nutrients, which is very conducive to the formation of flavonoids, vitamins and trace elements in this plant. Similar plants are also found in other provinces of China, mainly south of the Yangtze River. A few studies have also mentioned its growth in southeast Asia countries. History In 1385, it was given to the king of the Tujia minority as a present that was claimed to cure diseases. At that time, it was named \\"heaven tea\\". In 1837, during the Qing dynasty, it was given to the Emperor of China as a present from the Tujia. The Emperor found that the tea had amazing health effects, so he ordered that the tea be exclusively for himself. Moyeam is still made using the 600-year-old method of the Tujia. It is said that only females are taught how to make it.

It is a follow up to the 2011 feature film Captain America: The First Avenger, and is the fourth Marvel One-Shot short film. The film is directed by Louis D'Esposito from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, and stars Hayley Atwell as Carter, along with Bradley Whitford and Dominic Cooper. In Agent Carter, Peggy Carter sets out on a solo mission to acquire the mysterious Zodiac while facing sexism post-World War II at the SSR, a precursor to S.H.I.E.L.D. A Marvel One-Shot featuring Peggy Carter was in the works for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co- president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark. The short was released on the home media release of Iron Man 3, and was received positively by critics and the audience from an earlier screening at San Diego Comic-Con. It won a Golden Reel Award. This response led to ABC ordering a television series expansion of the short; Marvel's Agent Carter aired from January 2015 to March 2016, over two seasons. Plot One year after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, Agent Peggy Carter is now a member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR). She faces sexism from her boss, Agent John Flynn, who treats her condescendingly and keeps her compiling data and code breaking while assigning field cases to the male agents. The SSR's main concern is the mysterious Zodiac, which they have been unable to recover for some time. One night alone in the office while the men are out together, Carter answers the case line to hear of the location of the Zodiac. Though three to five agents are recommended, Carter decides to go to the location herself. Fighting off multiple guards, Carter is able to retrieve the Zodiac, a mysterious serum, herself. The next day, Flynn reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission, and dismisses the indignant Carter as just an \\"old flame\\" of Captain America's who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. However, before he can officially punish her, the case line rings again, this time with Howard Stark on the other end, who informs Flynn that Carter will co-head the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D. In a mid-credits scene, Dum Dum Dugan is seen poolside with Stark, marveling at two women wearing the newly created bikinis. Cast Production on the short began when Hayley Atwell agreed to reprise her role from Captain America: The First Avenger. * Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter: An SSR agent forced to work in data analysis and code breaking since the end of World War II, Carter reprises her role from Captain America: The First Avenger. On the character starring in her own short film, director Louis D'Esposito said that Marvel always wanted to do a Peggy Carter short since the character \\"was a fan-favorite and a Marvel Studios favorite\\". D'Esposito enjoyed the moment when Carter uses her compact to view the bad guy, which was ad libbed during filming, because \\"that's the essence of what she's about and what the film's about. Not only is she—especially in that time—a woman in a man's world, she still maintains her femininity\\". * Bradley Whitford as John Flynn: Carter's SSR boss. * Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark: The co-head and -founder of S.H.I.E.L.D., Cooper reprises his role from Captain America: The First Avenger. In the short, as an easter egg, Stark is seen wearing the same robe that his son Tony wears in Iron Man 2. Neal McDonough reprises his role of Timothy \\"Dum Dum\\" Dugan from previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and Chris Evans appears as Steve Rogers / Captain America via archive footage from The First Avenger. Shane Black, director and co-writer of Iron Man 3, voices the \\"Disembodied Voice\\", the caller on the other end of the case line. Production =Development= In August 2011, Marvel Studios announced that a couple of short films would be released direct-to-video, which were designed to be self-contained stories and known as Marvel One-Shots. Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said \\"It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features.\\" One of the ideas developed as a potential One-Shot was a spin-off from Captain America: The First Avenger, following the story of Peggy Carter after the events of that film. The idea was looked at again when Marvel was deciding on a short film to produce for the home media release of Iron Man 3 in 2013, and it was chosen for the spot, dependent on actress Hayley Atwell's availability. Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, who directed the previous One-Shot, Item 47, returned as director, while writer Eric Pearson also returned from the previous One-Shots. D'Esposito noted that the short had twice the budget of Item 47, but the same amount of shooting time so \\"the scope of it is much bigger. It's set in a period, there are more actors involved, the scale's bigger, there are three fight scenes—we've never had that in any of [the previous One-Shots].\\" Atwell agreed to the project after watching Item 47, and due to her love for the character and potential \\"to show off some of her skill sets\\" that were not seen in the film. Atwell worked for three days with the stunt team to rehearse the pre- choreographed fight sequences for the short. D'Esposito elaborated on the decision to focus on Carter, saying, \\"It's telling the best story, and finding that story we want to tell—whether it's connectivity to the Marvel Universe, or it's highlighting a character. In the case of Hayley, it's a little bit of both. We wanted to tell Peggy Carter's story—she's been left back in the '40s. Announcing to the world that she was running S.H.I.E.L.D. with Howard Stark is a great connectivity.\\" =Filming= Agent Carter was filmed over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget did not allow for a storyboard artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when it was found that the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet. D'Esposito chose to differentiate the short from The First Avenger by avoiding the sepia tone used for that film by director Joe Johnston, instead using a cooler blue color. The production used two old lenses (for both night and day) that gave the short some \\"better\\" lens flares that D'Esposito felt gave the period setting a more modern feel. D'Esposito used a Steadicam or a camera dolly for the action sequences, to avoid a \\"quick cutty or blurry or shaky\\" feel. D'Esposito said that the crew was ultimately \\"pushing our limit\\" to get the planned shots on schedule, and he eventually realized that he \\"wasn't going to get every shot and I wasn't going to get every punch and kick, so what we do is get the optimum\\". =Post-production= Visual effects shots of 1940s New York from Captain America: The First Avenger were reused in the short for budgetary reasons. D'Esposito noted the sequence where Carter comes \\"flying with the gun into the door\\" and the last fight, when Carter is \\"being attacked by the big guy\\", were both created with visual effects elements after they ran out of time to complete filming on them on set. In early 2013, Marvel approached visual effects company Perception to create the main-on-end title sequence for the short. Visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal was told to retell the story of the short in 90 seconds, so she decided to use stylized versions of imagery from the period and the short itself. A mixture of 2D and 3D animation was used to achieve a final 2D look. Music Composer Christopher Lennertz, who previously collaborated with D'Esposito on the One-Shot Item 47, composed the music for Agent Carter. Like the rest of the short, D'Esposito wanted the music to reflect the period setting, but to have a modern feel to it as well, so he sent Lennertz Johnny Rivers' \\"Secret Agent Man\\" as a reference track, despite it having been released in the 1960s, since it had the feel and sentiment D'Esposito was looking for. Release Agent Carter was first shown in full at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International. It was then released on the Iron Man 3 home media, first on September 3, 2013 in digital download form, and then on Blu- ray and 3D Blu-ray on September 24, 2013. D'Esposito said that it was decided to release the short along with Iron Man 3 because \\"the time was right\\", with the Iron Man 3 home media being released before the opening of Captain America: The Winter Soldier in theaters. It is also included on the bonus-disc of the \\"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\\" box set, which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as the other Marvel One-Shots. The collection features audio commentary from D'Esposito and Atwell, and was released on December 8, 2015. Reception Rosie Fletcher of Total Film noted that the short was well received by the audience at Comic Con, and praised Atwell's performance. She said the short \\"looks great and packs some euphoric action moments\\". Andy Hunsaker at Crave Online gave the short a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it a fun treat that \\"gives its title character the send-off she deserves\\", and hoping that it would lead to further female-focused properties from Marvel. IGN's Scott Collura called Atwell \\"the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun.\\" He felt the short seemed more of a proof-of-concept that female-based superhero projects could work, but that \\"Atwell never loses touch with her feminine side\\" either. The Movie Ramblings review of the short highlighted its \\"short, sharp and witty script mixed with some equally sharp action\\" and D'Esposito's direction, naming it the best Marvel One-Shot at that point. Flickering Myth called the short \\"a great effort. A nice, compact story that gives us a lot of great moments with the character.\\" The reviewer felt Flynn made a \\"great foil\\" to Carter, and also noted the \\"great cameos and a post credit scene that should put a smile on everybody's face....Agent Carter is another great Marvel offering that shows how committed they are to the idea of an expanded universe where these great characters get time to shine.\\" The short won the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound & Music Editing: Direct to Video – Live Action. Television series Marvel's Agent Carter, a television series inspired by the short film also starring Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, was ordered by ABC on May 8, 2014, and began its first season of eight episodes on January 6, 2015. Dominic Cooper and Neal McDonough also reprised their role of Stark and Dugan in the series, while D'Esposito directed the first episode, and Christopher Lennertz returned to compose the music. The series was created by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, writers on the Captain America films, with Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, and Chris Dingess serving as showrunners. The series takes place in the middle of the short, before Carter learns that she will be co-head of S.H.I.E.L.D., where she secretly assists Stark with a mission, unbeknownst to the SSR. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, consisting of 10 episodes. ABC canceled Agent Carter on May 12, 2016.

Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World: Ecology and Conservation. Washington, DC: Island, 2011. Print. The Valdivian forest is one of the few forested regions in the world with climate conditions to be considered a temperate climate. Its ecological systems provide habitat for a clustering of some of the highest biodiversity in the world. Many of the species are endemic to Valdivia and are descendants of Gondwana Species. For example, Araucaria araucana or \\"Monkey Puzzle Tree\\", and Fitzroya cupressoides \\"Alerce\\". Due to the region's unique landscape and biodiversity millions of visitors come to the area annually. National Parks in the region provide opportunities for many tourism operations. In an effort to help preserve and expand conserved areas Ecotourism or Sustainable Tourism plays a vital role. The economic benefits affect not only the park areas but also the local communities. Ecotourism accounts for 4.6% of Chile's GNP.Prideaux, Bruce, ed. \\"Rainforest Tourism, Conservation & Management: Challenges for Sustainable Development.\\" The Earthscan Forest Library From Routledge (2014): n. pag.

The top three destinations in those areas are the Coguillio National Park, the Villarica National Park, and the Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park. The last of those hosts 25% of all visitors to Chile. Protected areas Approximately 14.1 million hectares of the Valdivian forest is in the Chilean government conservation park system SNASPE.Auchard, Anibal, and Pablo Villarroel. \\"Protected Areas in Chile: History, Current Status, and Challenges.\\" Natural Areas Journal 22 (2002): 318-30. 2002.

La Corporación Nacional Foresta (CONAF), a Chilean government agency under the Ministry of Agriculture, make decision on forest policies and sustainable forest management.\\"Quiénes Somos.\\" CONAF. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Nov. 2014. Funding is provided by several sources including government funding, park fees, and private investments. SNASEP conservation land is divided into four different categories (1) Virgin Region Reserve (2) National Park (3) National Reserve (4) National Monument. Within National Parks CONAF identifies and assigns land into six different zones: *Intangible *Primitive *Extensive *Intensive *Special Use *Recuperation Each of these zones have guidelines as to status and type of ecosystem and what kinds of activities may take place within that zone. Intangible and Primitive zones have little to no human interaction, although some allowances are made for scientific research and education purposes. Extensive zones act as separation between other zones and infrastructure such as major road ways. Intensive and Special Use zones have experienced the heaviest recreation traffic and supporting infrastructure. These can include service and recreation facilities, as well as administration buildings. Recuperation zone is an interim designation, assigned to areas that have experienced a major disturbance and are in the process of recovering vegetation. A majority of protected land is in small holdings. These tracts are held in the hands of private owners and are not included in an inventory of lands. Some private buyers buy land to help protect it. Recent numbers show land bought for conservation by private owners Doug and Kris Tompkins totals around .5 million hectares. Recently Chile \\"establish[ed] the first Marine and Coastal Protected Areas, including one along the Valdivian coastline, to increase the amount of protected coastline.\\" Ecotour excursions Excursions generally fall under one of two categories: organized or independent. Organized excursions are booked through a tour company and include any of the following activities: sport fishing, whale watching, zip lining, and guided bird watches. These types of tours are the most effective way to increase exposure to an area. Local visitors and independent travelers participate in activities such as camping and hiking that is not an officially organized event. The coastal waters off the coast of Valdivia offer many opportunities to experience its unique marine ecosystem. For example, sport fishing is a growing million dollar enterprise. The vital whale feeding and breeding habitat off of Chiloe Island is a big draw for tourists to see whales up close. Other companies offer trekking on sections of the Patagonia Icefield. Lodges and overnight options are available through various local and international companies.  Local and indigenous peoples The land of the indigenous Huilliche and Pehuenche people offers many opportunities for ecotourism development. Like many local communities sustainable tourism provides a supplementary form of income. Through various services and operations tourism not only boosts the economy but also provides an environment to educate and share local and traditional culture and knowledge about ecological systems and management. Such models as Community Based EcoTourism (CBET) encompasses a variety of organizational set ups (networks, co-ops, and associations etc.) which help communities work with other organizations to maximize resources and facilitate communication.Zalamea, Felipe. \\"A Different Approach: The Good Living Tourist Model.\\" The International Ecotourism Society. N.p., 19 June 2013. Web. 15 Nov. 2014. Such infrastructure allows open channels of communication and exchange of resources between people on the ground and larger organizations such as NGOs. In order to maintain constant revenue, a community must not become a monoeconomy which could collapse in the event of economic downturn. Communities must manage the increased pressure to put stress on natural resources to accommodate visitor numbers. There is also a need to ensure that money stays in the local economy by reducing the number of international companies or their scope in the tourism. When it comes to policy making, small communities benefit greater from bottom up government, by reducing opportunities for exploitation of natural resources and by preserving the integrity of the flora and fauna. Problems and solutions The Chilean government spends a significant amount of resources promoting ecotourism. A major critique by researchers is that the support for planning and management is not sufficient. There is a need for an increase in the number of park rangers, as well for additional planning and management training and education, in particular training with a higher emphasis on science/biology/ecology and humanities. Agencies such as the US Forest Service provides training for park rangers and gives planning and management advice.\\"US Forest Service: International Programs.\\" US Forest Service, n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2014. Research by graduate students from the University of North Carolina have evaluated accredited (by National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) or Society of American Foresters (SAF)). There are also park and recreation degree programs from various universities through the US and internationally whose researchers have included interviews and surveys performed by Chilean park managers. These programs stress the importance of communication skills, multilateral cooperation, natural resource management, and outdoor recreation service skills. Another problem with the park system is the lack of stable money flow. Some of park funding comes from the government. However an increasing amount comes from private investment, which can fluctuate. Also, private investment comes with political and social pressures that may or may not be in the best interest for the goal of conservation. With the growing economic incentive of ecotourism increasing numbers of foreign companies move into and circulate revenue out of the Chilean economy.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Glentworth, a single-storeyed, high-set timber residence, stands on the original Bayswater subdivisions purchased by Katherine Mary Pery in 1879. The Hon. Cecil Standish Stackpole Pery was a clerk in the titles office. In 1888 the Chalk family bought the property, which remained their home until the mid-1960s. Michael Chalk was a highly successful bus proprietor, whose business provided vital communication links between the western suburbs and the city. In 1967 the property passed to the Salvation Army, which resold it in 1975. The residence remains a family home. The home has since been renovated with modern extensions added to the rear of the property. The existing frontage design has been maintained and is a prime example of an 1880s Queensland timber colonial residence.  Description  Glentworth is a single-storeyed timber house on stumps, with a central axial corridor and wide verandahs to three sides. It has a pyramid-shaped, corrugated iron roof crowned by a large timber finial. Convex iron-sheeted verandah roofs are separated from the main roof by a small cornice and paired timber console brackets. Verandah decoration is restrained: slender timber posts with capitals and brackets; cross-braced timber balustrading; and a timber fretwork pediment of intricate design crowned by another tall timber finial, above the entrance. The cladding is of wide chamferboards, and linings and partitions are of vertically jointed tongue and groove. Externally the house retains its original character, although little remains of the 19th century garden layout. Glentworth is situated above a gently rising lawn bordered by tall palms and trees, and is visible for a considerable distance from the north. It dominates the vista at the top of Agars Street, and is associated visually with Boondah, Baroona and other early timber residences in Howard Street, Rosalie.

It was apparently designed by Richard Gailey and built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 June 1993.  History  This single-storeyed weatherboard house stands on land which was alienated in 1879 by George Blaxland Mott and subdivided after his death in 1882. Ellen Wickham, widow of Captain John Clements Wickham, the governing official of Moreton Bay settlement until 1859, bought the site and lived there in a house called Manchonlas until her death in 1896. This dwelling was razed about 1906 and was replaced by Boondah c.1907, apparently to a design by notable architect Richard Gailey. By 1907 Fenton Robinson was living at this address and the property remained with the Robinson family until 1967 and was acquired by the present owners in 1972.  Description  Boondah is a single-storeyed weatherboard house with a corrugated iron gabled roof. The building sits on concrete stumps with timber batten infill and is sited on a ridge with the ground sloping to the northeast. The symmetrical north elevation has two corner octagonal ogee shaped cupola's with tall timber finials and a central front entrance porch with a projecting gable roof.

It was designed by Benjamin Backhouse and built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The original residence, called Baroona, was designed by Benjamin Backhouse and built in 1866 for William Draper Box on land which the architect had alienated in 1861 and Box acquired in 1865. The property extended from Baroona Road on one side to the outskirts of Torwood on the other. Box had arrived in Brisbane in 1862 to establish a Queensland branch of his father's mercantile firm, and lived at Baroona until 1885. He was a member of the Queensland Club and of the Queensland Legislative Council from 1874 until his death in 1904. During subsequent years the house was rented by two prominent politicians. Hon. John Donaldson Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly was in residence from about 1886 to 1889, followed by Sir Robert Philp of Burns Philp and Co, the Queensland Premier from 1899 to 1901. William Melbourne Watts, Land Commissioner, purchased the house in 1899 and sold it to Emily and Cornelius Geaney in 1919. Geaney was the City Mutual Life Insurance Company manager and his family retained the property until 1951 when Dr and Mrs Hill became the owners. It was sold again in 1984. The building was extensively modified by successive owners including the addition of rooms, brick render, eastern verandahs, fretwork gable, northern porch and a modern kitchen. The name Baroona is also used for the main road, the locality and the municipal ward.  Description  Driveway to Baroona, ca. 1885 Baroona is a single-storeyed rendered masonry building with a corrugated iron gabled roof. The building sits on a level hilltop site and has verandahs to the east and southeast, and to portions of the north and south elevations. The gables have timber finials and decorative bargeboards with the eastern bay gable featuring timber fretwork. Verandahs have corrugated iron skillion roofs and the north verandah has an entrance porch with projecting gable. The east and southeast verandahs sit on timber stumps and have latticed valance and cast iron balustrades. The south verandah has timber arches with lattice infill and opens off a hall with a corrugated iron barrel vault roof which is lined with tongue and groove boards. This vault has glazing to the western end and a central square raised skylight. The building has sash windows and French doors open onto the verandahs with exposed windows having timber shutters. A brick cellar is located on the southern side, a carport is attached to the southwest and a separate rendered masonry garage with a corrugated iron gabled roof and decorative timber finials and bargeboards is located to the west. The grounds include a lawn tennis court to the north, mature trees to the west and south and a stone embankment to the northeast.  Heritage listing  Baroona was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.

Such rotary transfer machines are used for producing a large lot of parts in fairly short cycle times. Operation In rotary transfer machines, the workpieces are located and clamped in pallet type fixtures that are indexed in a circular path. During one cycle, sequential machining operations are performed simultaneously on the workpieces. The indexed table turns vertically or horizontally, and its movement could be continuous or intermittent. As the indexing table turns, the subsequent machining operation is repeated on the workpiece which was just machined by the previous station. This design combines automated part feed with simultaneous operations, enabling rapid completion of parts. Applications Rotary transfer machines are commonly used for mass- production of metal parts in the automotive industry and for pneumatic and hydraulic fittings. The parts can range from simple to complex, depending on the layout of the machining tool, which is often custom designed for manufacturing of a single part or family of parts. Rotary arrangement presents a compact arrangement which saves floor space. Annual production capacity of one rotary transfer machine can range from 100'000 units to tens of millions of units. Rotary transfer machines can generally cope with all standard machining operations like turning, milling, drilling, reaming, threading, recessing, marking, deburring, etc... for sizes ranging more or less from a fingernail up to a backpack.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1882 to 1888 by J Smith & Sons. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Queensland Club building was constructed between 1882-84. The club was established in December 1859 following the apparent success of the North Australian Club in Ipswich, and coinciding with the establishment of Queensland as a separate colony. Adopting the British tradition of private clubs for influential members of the community, it provided a recreational venue and accommodation for men of common interests and socio-economic backgrounds. Members were mainly pastoralists, politicians, and business and professional men. The club met initially in small premises in Mary Street. As membership increased, a larger venue was required and in 1881 the club purchased three allotments on the corner of George and Alice Streets, which was known as Hodgsons Corner. FDG Stanley, a member of the club, was appointed architect. The proximity to the seat of government made it an appropriate locale for the new club premises. Stanley's plans were modified by the members and finally approved in March 1882. The contractor was J Smith and Sons and the contract sum was . The building was opened in June 1884 and contained 41 members' bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a clubroom, dining room, billiard room, smoking room, visitors room, offices and the necessary kitchens, servants rooms and toilets, providing a \\"home away from home\\" for society's male elite. In September 1888 the club purchased the adjoining site in Alice Street for , and stables, laundry and a bottle house were erected. Three years later these buildings were demolished and a bowling green established. The green remained mostly unused and in 1900, it was converted to a tennis court. In 1973, a green ban was imposed on the Queensland Club by the Builders Labourers Federation to stop its destruction to make an office block, along with green bans on The Mansions and Bellevue Hotel. In 1985 a fire caused damage to the club premises and changes to the room layout of the upper floor bedrooms were carried out in conjunction with the repair work. Minor renovations were undertaken during 1990-91.  Description  The Queensland Club, located on the corner of Alice and George Streets diagonally opposite Parliament House, is a three-storey rendered brick building incorporating Italianate elements. The building is a broad 'H'-shape in plan form, with its long elevation to Alice Street and one side to George Street. The main entry is in the central part of the building beneath a deep porch. There are verandahs on two levels across the front and down the side of each wing. These are supported by Tuscan columns on the ground floor and slender Corinthian cast iron columns on the first floor. The balustrades on both levels are of decorative cast ironwork. At the end of each wing is a projecting bay window on the ground and first floor level with open balustrade above. Quoins punctuate the corners of the building and there are banded piers on either side of the entry. Above the third level the building has an open parapet and large ornate urns at the corner of each wing. A classical pediment topped by a finial is located above the entry. The main entry has a large semi-circular fan-light. On the ground floor the windows are double hung sashes and on the first floor French-lights. The grounds contain mature trees and tennis court. The spacious entrance hall has a staircase with cast iron balustrading. The ground floor contains large and lofty reception rooms and a dining room in the northern wing. The joinery is of cedar with restrained plasterwork mostly original. The upper floors contain guest rooms. Both street frontages are fenced with a low rendered masonry retaining wall with square piers and cast iron balustrade infill. The Alice Street main entrance features an ogee shaped cast iron arch with a central light fitting and swing gates. A section of the George Street carpark is bounded by a wire fence and a large fig tree is located in the Alice and George Street corner garden.

The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Queensland Club is significant for its special association with the work of architect FDG Stanley, a member of the Queensland Club.

Her work has been exhibited internationally, and she has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors; the city of Suzhou has named an art institution after her (the Xiao Hui Wang Art Museum), a rare honor for a living artist. She has been profiled by the prestigious Hong Kong magazine Phoenix Weekly as one of the Top Fifty Most Influential Chinese Worldwide. She has been a professor at Shanghai's Tongji University since 2003, where she runs the Xiao Hui Wang Art Center. She divides her time between China and Germany. Early life Xiao Hui Wang was born in Tianjin. Her mother was a music professor and her father an engineer. She grew up during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, a hard time for \\"black\\" (politically suspect) cultural families such as hers. In 1978, she enrolled at Tongji University to study architecture, receiving a bachelor's degree in the discipline in 1983. A few years later, in 1986, she received a Masters in Architecture from the same university, and married classmate (and promising architect) Yu Lin. Subsequently, as recipients of scholarships from the German government, both she and her husband moved to Germany to study further. Between 1987 and 1991, she studied a PhD at the Technical University of Munich; and between 1990 and 1992, she studied at the Munich Film Academy. In 1991, on the way to Prague, a fatal car crash took her husband's life and left Wang in the hospital. Having dabbled in photography since she was 13, she unexpectedly began to document her recovery visually. As the days went on, she took pictures of her hospital bed, of herself in her recovering state, of her hospital room, of her doctor, of friends who visited her. This critical experience gradually transformed her, giving her life new meaning and influencing her decision to become a professional artist. Professional life In 1992, after her recovery, she began holding photographic exhibitions again. Her first one during this period was held in Munich. The second one, in 1993, was held in Berlin. Aside from her photographic activities, she also began working on numerous film and television projects in Europe. She wrote scripts for the Bayerischer Rundfunk series Kulturen der Welt in that same year; then, in 1993, she was a consultant for the Sino-German documentary Families in Beijing: Courtyard House. In 1994, she wrote and directed her surrealistic art film The Broken Moon, efforts which won awards in Germany and Austria.http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2001/1213/pr21-1.html In 1995, she was the artistic supervisor for The Chair, a Sino-Japanese production, and wrote a screenplay called Blue Candle Burnt Out. She directed a documentary film on Peking Opera in 1996. In 1997, she held three photographic exhibits, two in Germany and one in China; six more would follow between 1998 and 2001, one in Switzerland, two in China and the rest in Germany. She won three awards during this time. In 2001, she was invited to become a professor at her alma mater, Tongji University, and founded the Xiao Hui Wang Art Center in 2003. In 2008, the Center won the international design competition for the 2010 Shanghai Expo Urban Footprint Theme Pavilion. Wang's growing reputation led to further work with international brands (Christofle, BASF, BMW, Cartier, A. Lange & Söhne, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Audi and Van Cleef & Arpels among others) and large-scale art projects from Chinese local governments. =Cooperation with Brands= In 2004, Wang organized an exhibition of her works (titled Boundless) for BMW in Munich. The exhibition attracted over 90,000 people, 5% of the city's population at the time. She also presided over a series of tie- in events titled \\"Dialogue between East and West\\", broadcast live on television. In attendance were Christian Ude (Mayor of Munich) and his wife Edith von Welser-Ude, Chinese Minister of Technology Wan Gang, Marketing Director of BMW Germany Dr. Wolfgang Armbrecht, architect Albert Speer Jr., writer Tilman Spengler, Prof. Dr. Guan Yuqian and banker Peter von Guretzky. In 2005, BASF invited her to organize a creative photography contest. Over 26,000 submissions were received. In 2010, Wang was asked by BMW MINI to design the \\"Car of Dreams\\". Its unveiling, MINI RELOADED, was part of the 2010 Dream Plan, a corresponding, highly publicized event in Shanghai which showcased 10000 Dreams, her multimedia work that centered on the written, painted, photographed and videotaped aspirations of 10,000 youths. The opening ceremony attracted 1000 visitors. In 2011, Wang became the first Asian artist to design and produce limited-edition silver goods for renowned silverware brand Christofle (other artists who had worked with the brand in this manner are Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, Roger Tallon and Andree Putman).

Manfred Schneckenburger has described her as \\"an icon of progress for the younger generation despite the Chinese consciousness of tradition\\".Manfred Schneckenburger, \\"The Liberated Camera\\", Introspection, Hirmer, Munich, 2012, p. 24 Her work has mainly focused on three great, occasionally overlapping themes: aestheticism, vitality and humanity. Art critic Beate von Reifenscheid, in an essay about her, wrote that: \\"Xiao Hui Wang's photography has been characterized by an especially penetrating quality of vision – one that tells us about people, about the contexts of their lives, about existence at the limits of psychological endurance, about loneliness and despair. However, she also traces the beauty of the human figure in her photos, the erotic tension between man and woman, the lives of women in seedy 'clubs', and even the eroticism of flowers, whose charged sexuality goes beyond that of Robert Mapplethorpe's black-and-white photographs\\".Beate von Reifenscheid, \\"Introspection\\", Introspection, Hirmer, Munich, 2012, p. 14 Zhang Jianxing, Chairman of the Tianjin Photography Association, considers it immanently metaphorical, writing \\"Why are Xiao Hui Wang's many moments so powerful?

These islands have the colloquial name of the ABC Islands and are a part of the Alexander Archipelago. This brown bear population has a unique genetic structure, which relates them not only to brown bears but to polar bears as well. Its habitat exists within the Tongass National Forest, which is part of the perhumid rainforest zone. Morphology The ABC Islands bears have the appearance of the typical Alaska Peninsula brown bear, which includes milk chocolate-colored fur and a humped back, with a large size and reputation to match. Although the bear is commonly a milk-chocolate color, it can range from blonde to black. Along with the humped back, the bears also have a slightly dished profile to the face. The bears have long front claws. Adult males on average will weigh , with adult females weighing on average . Adult height will range on average from at the shoulder. Habitat As these bears reside within the Tongass National Forest, the bears depend on species that are found within the ecosystem of the Tongass. Two of the common tree species in this ecosystem include the Sitka spruce and the western hemlock. Diet The ABC Islands bears depend on a diet of various flora and fauna that is endemic to the region. For flora this includes grasses; other plants like bulbs; berries like salmonberries and blueberries; and mushrooms. For fauna this includes animals like voles, mice, squirrels, and salmon. Behavior The ABC Island bears are usually solitary creatures, except in areas with plentiful food sources. Areas with abundance of staples of their diet may cause attraction by multiple bears. The ABC Islands bears will reach sexual maturity on average at the age of four to seven years, with mating occurring between May and July. Winter hibernation for these bears occurs between the months of October until April, with June at the latest. Pregnant females will give birth to cubs in the den in January or February, with an average litter size of two to three cubs. The cubs remain with the mother for up to three years, during which time she will not get pregnant. Relationship to polar bears This brown bear retains all of the physical attributes and behavior associated with the brown bear, however, they do carry mitochondrial DNA that shows a match closer to polar bears than brown bears. =Studies=  1996 A study was conducted on the phylogeography of the brown bears in Alaska, specifically the subspecies that exist within Alaska. The study showed that there was no recent flow of genes from Admiralty to any other islands or mainland. The research for the study began in 1982, when bears on Admiralty were equipped with collars and tracked. These bears did not leave the island during the time. It was believed to be related to strong currents existing in the waters around the island which prevented the bears from swimming to nearby land masses. The study was also looking at the possibility of refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum, in which the Cordilleran Ice Sheet covered much of the Pacific coast. It is believed that certain populations existed only on the ABC Islands.  2011 A study on matrilineal polar bear hybridization in relationship to Irish lineage was conducted. The study used the ABC Islands population to support their hypothesis. Comparisons have shown that the ABC Islands had polar bears present during the Last Glacial Maximum, but Ireland most likely did not have proper habitat. Bone isotopic data shows that Irish bears had a similar terrestrial diet to late Pleistocene brown bears from Alaska, and not similar to the marine diet of polar bears. Thus it is shown that the Irish bears have common ancestry with polar bears and the ABC Islands bears. 2012 An international study led by Penn State University and the University of Buffalo has estimated that polar bears split from brown bears between 4 million and 5 million years ago. This would have been due to climate changes, which included ice ages. Hybrids have also been documented within the Northern Beaufort Sea of Arctic Canada. This is an area where the range of polar bears overlaps with the range of brown bears. Data was collected using the entire genome of three brown bears and one black bear in comparison to one modern polar bear and one polar bear remains estimated at 120,000 years old. Data shows that the brown bears and polar bears were isolated at the same time in which black bears became their own species. Brown bears and polar bears continued to remain isolated for a long period of time, theorized due to the presence of ice, before recent changes allowed polar bears and brown bears to interbreed again. It is estimated that polar bears and brown bears began to interbreed again about 160,000 years ago. The study shows that previous estimates of polar bears only existing 600,000 years ago was wrong, and that they have in fact been around much longer – four to five million years ago. This research analysis in particular discovered more genetic similarities between the polar bears and ABC Islands brown bears. This indicates that the study of the ABC Islands bears is also important to understanding the evolution of the polar bear. 2013 Research under Beth Shapiro (Associate Professor) at University of California, Santa Cruz shows that around 6.5% of the X chromosomes from the ABC Islands bears have recently come from polar bears, in contrast to 1% of the ABC Islands bears' genomes containing polar bear DNA. The study was conducted using seven polar bears, two brown bears, and one black bear to gather ancestral alleles. Based on research using various simulation scenarios, the team concluded that the ABC Islands bears descended from polar bears that gradually converted into brown bears through hybridization of male brown bears dispersing from the Alaskan mainland. It is believed that the present polar bear DNA stems from a group of polar bears that were stranded in Southeast Alaska at the end of the last ice age, and the bears were stranded due to receding ice. This would happen with male brown bears swimming over to the islands and mating with the female polar bears. The study from University of California, Santa Cruz shows that episodes of gene flow between polar bears and brown bears occurred only in isolated populations, without affecting the larger polar bear population, compared to prior hypothesis of past hybridization affecting all polar bear genes to contain brown bear genes as well. Prior studies have shown that the ABC Islands brown bears are the descendants of polar bears from male-dominated brown bears. The researchers of this study present a model that derives them from a population of polar bears that were stranded after the last glacial period, where brown bears migrated to the island and interbred, leaving the phenotype and genotype of these bears to be primarily brown bear. The research team hypothesizes that this may be a common outcome due to climate change or when an isolated species becomes overrun with an outside species that is able to form hybrids. Final results show that polar bears have no evidence of brown bear ancestry in their genes and ABC Islands bears show clear ancestry of polar bear genes. Fossil remains from the Last Glacial Maximum(LGM) show that there was no habitat suitable for brown bears to occupy during this time, this includes the area with which they need to inhabit. However, fossils in this area did show a concentration of marine mammals, especially ringed seals, which are a common staple to polar bears diet. Threats Conflict with humans is a major staple of disturbance to population numbers for the species. Conflict can include bears entering city populations or threatening hunters on the islands. Other possible disturbances include climate change. As this subspecies of brown bear proves, climate change can have an effect on the species overall.

Perak at that time was part of the British-administered Federated Malay States. He later played a prominent role of adopting the Perak's state anthem, Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan which was later used as the national anthem of Malaysia. Family He married Raja Tipah Binti Almarhum Sultan Shahabuddin Ri'ayat Shah Saifullah and then divorced. He had seven sons and three daughters: # Raja Chulan # Raja Abdul Malek # Raja Ahmad Hisham Tauphy son his Said # Raja Abdul Rahman # Raja Abdul Hamid # Raja Hussein Perak War Sultan Abdullah at Batak Rabit on Perak river, June 1874. Abdullah Muhammad Shah II of Perak was appointed as the 26th Sultan by the British after the signing of Pangkor Treaty on 20 January 1874. After this agreement, he was called Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah II. He stayed at Batak Rabit. Exile to the Seychelles In 1875, he was accused of being involved in the murder of British Resident JWW Birch and exiled to the Seychelles on 21 July 1876. Perak anthem & future Malaysian national anthem La Rosalie, a popular song composed by French lyricist, Pierre-Jean de Béranger (1780–1857) became a popular French melody and was prominent on the island of Mahé, in what is now the Seychelles. The song's popularity spread across the Indian Ocean and reached as far as Maritime Southeast Asia early in the 20th century. During his exile in the Seychelles, he adopted the melody as the Perak Royal Anthem, which is the present-day Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan. At the time of independence, each of the eleven states that made up the Federation of Malaya had their own anthem, but there was no anthem for the Federation as a whole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, at the time the Chief Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, organized and presided over a committee for the purpose of choosing a suitable national anthem. On his suggestion, a worldwide competition was launched. 514 entries were received from all over the world including a special submission from recording artist Is'real Benton. None were deemed suitable. Next the committee decided to invite selected composers of international repute to submit compositions for consideration. The composers chosen were Benjamin Britten, Sir William Walton who had recently composed the march for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, the American opera composer Gian Carlo Menotti and Zubir Said, who later composed Majulah Singapura, the anthem of Singapore. They were all turned down too. The Committee then turned to the Perak State Anthem. On 5 August 1957, it was selected on account of the \\"traditional flavour\\" of its melody. New lyrics for the national anthem were written jointly by the Panel of Judges— with the Tunku himself playing the leading role. Death Sultan Abdullah lived for a time in Singapore and then in Penang. In 1922, he was allowed to return to Kuala Kangsar, where he died soon after on 22 December 1922. He was interred at Bukit Chandan and was conferred the posthumous title of Marhum Habibullah.

In 1070, Guillaume, son of Archambaud IV of Bourbon (died 1095) became Seigneur of Montluçon and built a fortress on a castrum. The English occupied the Castle of Montluçon from 1171 to 1188. After that invasion, Philip Augustus handed it over to the Bourbon family. The latter transformed it into a stronghold. The remainder of the castle was built starting from 1370, at the heart of the Hundred Years' War, by Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. The edifice was surrounded by a double row of ramparts, was drilled by four doors and counted forty-one watchtowers. During the unification of the Bourbonnais to the crown of France, during the reign of Francis I, the castle was abandoned. Louis II Duke of Bourbon, was the main contributor to the construction of the castle. It was started during the Hundred Years' War, but people still worked on it on the eve of the Renaissance. In the first half of the 14th century, Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and his successors raised the big abode, more or less such as it is today. The square tower, the opening of the East facade, the North wing and the Clock Tower are dated from the middle of the 15th century and belong to three construction campaigns, the two first ones being very close to each other. Finally, during the last half of the 15th century, the gallery was raised on the court, and the North inside was embellished. These varied constructions, even though quite modern, enable us to follow the well-known evolution that was produced in the French military architecture during the 15th century. Louis II came up with the idea of a real fortified castle that he couldn’t achieve, and which was embellished by his successors, with a gallery, an elegant turret and wide openings, became a place of pleasure for the last Dukes of Bourbon. It has been abandoned since 1527. After 1662, the princes of Condé, became lords tenants of crown lands of the Bourbonnais, conceded the castle to a farmer and they became totally disinterested by it. This one is in a very poor shape according to Nicolas de Nicolay who observed that \\"without really taking care of the roof the castle fell in ruins, which was a \\"big shame\\". Coat of arms of Montluçon During the Revolution, only the coats of arms of the Dukes of Bourbon were destroyed from the Clock Tower. Then the police court, took its place in one of the rooms of the castle which, because of its size, served also as a place of meeting for the General Assembly of the inhabitants. The city of Montluçon bought the castle from Louis Joseph (the Prince of Condé at the time) on 8 April 1816 in order to do an infantry barracks. From that moment, the most deplorable demolitions happened.  Architecture  The castle got rid of its wood gallery to make room to concrete constructions. The inside was reworked many times for the installation of a court, an auditorium and offices for the city hall of Montluçon. To sum up, the castle of Montluçon, rebuilt during the very end of the 14th century had to suffer, after having known a moment of splendor, a three centuries period where nobody lived there. During the whole 19th century followed a period of demolitions still more disastrous. In 1935, the city of Montluçon restored the castle. From that restoration, only the wood gallery was carried out. Indeed, the gothic style skylight has been poorly restored and recovered by cement, as well as the room from the second floor of the donjon. A room that seemed to be the former bedroom of the Good Duke, Louis II of Bourbon, and in which he died in August 1410. In that room, there is a barrel vault in semicircle, raised, lowered on two arches. That vault is curious, because it is a rib vault with two additional branches, which go from each angle from the wall face, in order to end in the main keystone.A large stone at the top of an arch that locks the other stones in place This layout is caused by the fact that there is a hearth with cut section, the keystone which complete the whole of that room is composed of four fleurons shining all around a coat of arms and reunited by small arches in trefoil. The walls from that room are also covered by cement. The rock’s jointures of the castle of Montluçon are all renovated with cement as well, which cannot be considered as authentic. The ceilings from the main rooms of the castle were renovated with panelings, which were recovered, for some of them, by metal frames installed during the restoration of the 1930s. The castle was registered as one of the historical monuments the 15th of May, 1926.

The Bishop and political leader John Colenso famously summed him up as \\"a keen knife, liable to shut upon the hand that used it, and therefore to be used with caution\\". Early life and jail Statham was born on 6 February 1844, in Everton, Liverpool. He was a sickly child and was mostly home-schooled. He then entered Liverpool's cotton industry, at a time when the American Civil War was causing cotton speculation. He stole a large amount of his company's money in 1865, claiming he was affected by an \\"over-balanced mind\\". He then fled to continental Europe, disguised as a Catholic priest, but nonetheless suspiciously accompanied by a female \\"dancer\\" companion. He was soon caught and sentenced to 18 months hard labour. Unstable and hypersensitive, Statham wrote The Fiery Furnace (1895) about his mental state, and underwent a brief religious conversion during his time in jail. After a few months as a lay preacher, he gave it up to write poetry, and then became a newspaper editor to the Liverpool Albion. Writer and editor in South Africa =Natal Witness (1877-1879)= In 1877, he was invited to serve as editor to the Natal Witness, in southern Africa. He was fiercely independent and highly controversial as editor. A radical liberal anti-imperialist, who sided with the Boers in the Anglo-Boer War and with the Zulus in the Anglo-Zulu War, he was deeply unpopular and even made enemies of some people who shared his liberal views. The imperial policy under Lord Carnarvon was to enforce a system of confederation onto the states of southern Africa, bringing them together under British rule and preempting a feared \\"general and simultaneous rising of Kaffirdom against white civilization\\".M. Meredith: Diamonds, Gold and War. Simon & Schuster. 2007. Statham famously summed up the local perception of Carnarvon's plan for the region: He (Carnarvon) thought it no harm to adopt this machinery (Canadian Confederation System) just as it stood, even down to the numbering and arrangement of the sections and sub-sections, and present it to the astonished South Africans as a god to go before them. It was as if your tailor should say — \\"Here is a coat; I did not make it, but I stole it ready-made out of a railway cloak-room, I don't know whether you want a coat or not; but you will be kind enough to put this on, and fit yourself to it. If it should happen to be too long in the sleeves, or ridiculously short in the back, I may be able to shift a button a few inches, and I am at least unalterably determined that my name shall be stamped on the loop you hang it up by.\\"F. Statham: Blacks, Boers, & British: A Three-cornered Problem. MacMillan & Co. 1881. p.239. Statham's attacks on the imperial policy became so severe that they brought on fears for the owner of the newspaper, which led him eventually to clash with Statham. =Cape Post (1879-1880)= In December 1879, he resigned and moved to the Cape Colony, to become editor to the newly founded radically liberal Cape Post newspaper of Patrick McLoughlin. This newspaper had been founded, with the support of leaders such as John X. Merriman, John Molteno and Charles Fairbridge, in order to counter the belligerent and expansionist mood of the time, and to encourage spontaneous unity in southern Africa (as opposed to an enforced confederation under outside control). His paper quickly became controversial during the notorious \\"Koegas affair\\" (1879–80). This concerned the murder of five San people (Bushmen) by farmers, near the northern frontier. In the subsequent murder trial, the farmers were acquitted, and the resulting outrage focused on Attorney General Thomas Upington. The Cape Argus and Cape Post accused Upington of deliberately allowing the trial to take place in a racist and hostile town that would be expected to acquit the murderers, due to prejudice and local influence. The culmination of the outrage was a public campaign, led by Saul Solomon, McLoughlin, Statham and others, accusing Upington and his colleagues of allowing white juries to acquit white murderers from murdering blacks. Upington then launched a series of libel suits against the protest leaders, which were partially successful. His friendship with some of the leading liberal figures of the Cape, such as Saul Solomon of the Cape Argus, and support from powerful anti-imperialist leaders like Merriman and Molteno, altogether could not save the Cape Post from its own financial difficulties, and it was forced to close the following year in 1880. Statham bitterly blamed his Cape benefactors for having persuaded him to relinquish his Natal position without providing his editorship in the Cape with sufficient financial backing. =Natal Witness (1881-1887)= Returning to England briefly, he moderated his radical views and wrote Blacks, Boers and British: a Three- Cornered Problem (1881), attempting to appeal to the mainstream in advocating a compromise coming together of the three population groups. The same year he was back in Natal again, where, once again, he assumed the editorship of the Natal Witness in 1881. Once again his writings were controversial, attacking the colonial establishment including the powerful Shepstone family, Sir Henry Bulwer, and Garnet Wolseley's settlement in Zululand. His writings caught the attention of the London Colonial Office which found itself repeatedly embarrassed by Statham's reports. Evelyn Ashley, the under-Secretary for colonies, resolved to dispose of the man his office dubbed \\"that pestilent journalist\\". In 1887, Statham's criminal past was revealed and made public by the Colonial Office, which even presented it in the House of Commons, causing Statham severe repercussions and immense difficulties. These were compounded by a libel suit that was filed against him by the Colonial Office, for his writings. He then lost a libel suit from J.W. Shepstone. He resigned as editor on 31 August 1887 intending to go to England to clear his name. =Natal Advertiser (1888-1890)= After another brief spell in England and a failed attempt to reinstate himself and his reputation there, he returned again to southern Africa and served as editor to the Natal Advertiser, which was based in Durban. Here he attacked the new \\"British South Africa company\\" which he saw as simply a new vehicle of imperialism in southern Africa. In 1889, Statham's predictions of the situation in that year - printed a decade earlier in 1879 - were unearthed and reprinted verbatim, due to their extraordinary accuracy. =The North (1890-1895)= Statham briefly moved to the Transvaal Republic where he edited the Transvaal Observer (1890-1891), and afterwards The Independent in Kimberley (1891–93). He had in fact been attracted to The Independent due to its name, but he quickly found out that it was in fact committed to a pro-Rhodes policy. The Star in Johannesburg offered him an editorship position, but he refused due to its pro-Rhodes agenda, preferring unemployment to endorsing an ideology he hated. For the next few years he subsisted on occasional income from articles he wrote, and lived in poverty. Writings in Europe (1895-1899) Statham returned to Europe in 1895, as representative of the Transvaal Republic, and served as the republic's press attaché in London. His writings were intent on refuting the propaganda which was filling the British press at the time with regards to the South African situation. He prophesied that the Jameson Raid would be followed by a renewed imperial attempt to incorporate the Boer republics. His propaganda work during the Boer war led to trouble with the police again, this time as a spy, as he was followed and his mail watched. At this time, he wrote the fiery political books Mr Magnus (1896), In South Africa as It Is (1897), Paul Kruger and his Times (1898) and The South African Crisis: the Truth about the Transvaal (1899), in which he attacked Cecil Rhodes, De Beers, and the chartered British South Africa Company (BSAC). The British government's granting of the BSAC's royal charter to occupy and administer what became Rhodesia was, Statham wrote, \\"the most extraordinary usurpation of power ever perpetrated, since the Popes gave over the Peruvians into the hands of Pizarro\\". Later life In later life he tried to work as a music professor and composed several music pieces, such as South African National Songs, While Table Mountain Stands (his proposed national anthem for the Cape Colony), Volkslied (anthem for the Transvaal). In addition to his anthems for the various states of southern Africa, he composed Komt broeders komt! as a proposed anthem for a united South Africa. He died of kidney failure in Surrey in March 1908.http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=94124&back;=S. Haw: Bearing witness: the Natal Witness, 1846–1996. 1996. References * F. R.

Intention involves mental activities such as planning and forethought. Definition Folk psychology explains human behavior on the basis of mental states, including beliefs, desires, and intentions. Mental mechanisms, including intention, explain behavior in that individuals are seen as actors who have desires and who attempt to achieve goals that are directed by beliefs. Thus, an intentional action is a function to accomplish a desired goal and is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire. There is also a theoretical distinction between intentionality (intentional actions), and a mental state of intention for the future. Searle (1983) labeled these as intention-in-action and prior intention respectively. Prior intentions reflect forethought about intentions-in-action; prior intentions do not need to be carried out to be considered intentions. An unfulfilled intention is a prior intention that has no action associated with it. Astington (1993) outlined the connections between mental states (desires, beliefs, and intentions) and actions carried out by an individual in order to reach a goal; these connections are referred to as the Intentional Chain. The proposed connective chain is that desire causes intention, which causes action, which causes outcome. The Intentional Chain maps the linking of a desire to the satisfaction of a goal via the intermediary intention. The development of an understanding of intention Psychological research suggests that understanding intentions of others may be a prerequisite for a higher- level understanding of other people's minds or theory of mind. Theory of mind research attempts to map how children come to understand the mind as a representational device for the world. This research has focused on the development of knowledge that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own. A basic ability to comprehend other people's intentions based on their actions is critical to the development of theory of mind. Understanding intention is thought to be pivotal in understanding social contexts in numerous ways. First, acquiring an understanding of intention is important for development in that it helps children conceptualize how people and animals differ from objects. Much of behavior is caused by intentions, and understanding intentions helps to interpret these behaviors. Second, intentions are integral to an understanding of morality. Children learn to assign praise or blame based on whether actions of others are intentional. Intention is also necessary to understand and predict the plans and future actions of others. Understanding the intentions and motives of others aids in the interpretation of communication, and the achievement of cooperative goals. Social, cognitive and developmental psychological research has focused on the question: How do young children develop the ability to understand other people's behaviors and intentions? = Intentional acts in infancy and childhood = From an early age, typically- developing children parse human actions in terms of goals, rather than in terms of movements in space, or muscle movements. Meltzoff (1995) conducted a study in which 18-month-olds were shown an unsuccessful act. For instance, children watched an adult accidentally under or over shoot a target, or attempt to perform an action but their hand slipped. The aim of the study was to determine whether the children were able to interpret the intention of the adult, regardless of the actual action performed. Young children have a tendency to imitate other people's actions. The outcome measure was what the child chose to re-enact—the actual event (literal motions), or the adult's goal, which was not accomplished. The results of the study suggested that 18-month-olds are able to infer unseen goals and intentions of others based on their actions. Infants who saw unsuccessful attempts at a target act and infants who saw the target act imitated the act at a higher rate than infants who saw neither the act nor an attempt. Similar paradigms were conducted with children 9 months old and 15 months old. Nine-month-olds did not respond to the unsuccessful attempt demonstrations; however, 15-month-olds acted similarly to the 18-month-olds. This suggests that between 9 months and 15 months of age the ability to infer intentions in other people develops. The development of understanding intention has also been studied in toddlers. As mentioned previously, an intentional action is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire. In that case, what was intended can be interpreted as a function of an understanding for what was desired. When outcomes are achieved without the action of the individual directed at the goal, intention is not attributed to the actor; rather, the event is considered an accident. Research by Astington and colleagues (1993) found that 3-year-olds are skilled at matching goals to outcomes to infer intention. If another individual's goals match an outcome, 3-year-olds are able to conclude that the action was done “on purpose.” Conversely, when goals do not match outcomes, the children labeled the individual's actions as accidental. Children may come to distinguish between desire and intention when they learn to view the mind as a medium for representations of the world. Astington argues that initially desire is undifferentiated from intention in that both function as a goal state. Children then develop a more mature command of understanding other's intentions when they are able to represent an action as caused by a prior intention that is separate from desire. Thus, research suggests that by the age of fifteen months, humans are capable of understanding intentional acts in others. The ability to distinguish between intention and desire develops in early childhood. Gestures and object-directed actions have also been studied in connexion with the development of the understanding of intention. The development of the ability to use gestures and object-directed actions in social situations has been studied from numerous perspectives, including the embodiment perspective and the social-cognitive perspective. =Gestures and object-directed intentions= Gestures are often recognized as a tool indicative of higher social reasoning. In order to engage in or understand a gesture, an individual has to recognize it as an indicator of an object or event separate from the self or the actor. It is thought that pointing, especially declarative pointing (i.e. pointing intended to direct and share intention rather than request an object), reveals the understanding of others as attentional and intentional agents (e.g. Liszkowski, Carpenter, & Tomasello, 2007). This understanding is indicated by object-directed reactions to pointing (rather than focusing on the hand). Pointing is also thought to denote perspective-taking ability and understanding of intention, as the individual must be able to understand that the actor is attending to the object and, perhaps most importantly, that the actor is attempting to communicate information regarding the referent. The development of pointing is thought to reach a critical stage at around 9 to 12 months in normally developing children (e.g. Leung & Rheingold, 1981; Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Schaffer, 2005). Liszkowski and colleagues (2004) found that human children begin to point at around one year of age and do so with a multiple motives, including sharing attention and interest. Earlier pointing may be different in nature and is thought to develop from a learned association between reaching and adult responsiveness to the child's desire for a referent object. Thus, it seems pointing may be more complex than a straightforward indicator of social understanding. Early pointing may not indicate an understanding of intention; rather it may indicate an association between the gesture and interesting objects or events. However, an understanding of intention may develop as the child develops a theory of mind and begins to use pointing to convey meaning about referents in the world. = Embodiment perspective = The embodiment hypothesis holds that cognition arises out of an individual's physical interactions with the environment. In this way, environment and behavior are an integral part of cognition and what psychologists conceive of as ‘mental representations’ are indistinguishable from perception and action (e.g. Smith, 2005). The ontogenetic development of social cognition may be thought of as intertwined with the development pointing actions. According to this perspective, gestures are not just indicators of development but play a key role in how children come to develop advanced social cognition, including understanding of object-directed relations and human intention. In particular, engaging in physical actions oneself may provide insight into the structure of another's actions (eventually leading to a more nuanced understanding of another's mind). One method of determining developmental relations between actions and an understanding of social nuances behind actions is to assess correlations between infants’ reactions to actions and the frequency with which infants produce actions. Children are generally able to produce actions around the same time they are considered to be capable of understanding the actions in others. For instance, Woodward and Guajardo (2002) found a correlation between children's ability to produce points (either during the experience or based on parental report of pointing at home) and their understanding of object-directed pointing (as evidenced by a preference for looking at a new object rather than a new hand path in a habituation paradigm) by 12 months. In addition, Brune and Woodward (2007) found that infants who produce object-directed points tended to have an understanding of pointing and infants who engaged in shared attention tended to have an understanding of eye gaze. Although the findings are correlational, they support the idea that actions may facilitate cognitive understanding. It is unclear whether self- produced pointing gestures causally influence an understanding of pointing as relational; however, there is experimental evidence which suggests that infants supported in a new action skill will subsequently develop an understanding of that action. For instance, infants allowed to grasp objects with Velcro mittens gained an understanding of object-directed grasping. = Social-cultural perspective = A social-cultural perspective includes the notion that not just actions, but partaking in social interactions and cooperation (both observing and acting) are key to both ontogenetic social development and responsible for larger cultural institutions, symbol systems, and other human social abilities (e.g. Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005). This social-cultural perspective is derived from the Vygotskian view that higher cognitive functions originate in relations between individuals. The strict version of this view is that these functions are social actions that have been internalized. Pointing, according to Vygotsky, starts out as an attempt to grab a desired object. Then, a transitional gesture develops in which the individual reaches toward the object when it is desired as a cue to another to retrieve it. This transitional gesture, says Vygotsky, is an important step toward language in that participation in these social interactions are internalized and become an understanding of the psychological functions of others. Thus, pointing is an example of the internalization process that occurs over a long series of developmental events. These gestures help children to gain an understanding of triadic interactions, as the gestures go from being simply about the objects to being specifically directed at people and conveying intention toward others. Tomasello and colleagues proposed a social-cultural perspective for understanding human affinity for advanced social cognition (e.g. Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005). This view takes from Vygotsky's theory the idea that social interactions (such as pointing) are not just indicative of higher cognitive functions, such as understanding intention, but play an important role in shaping them. They argue that advanced cognitive abilities are derived from the tendency to cooperate and engage in collaborative activities (e.g. Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005). It was originally suspected that such foundational cognitive skills leading to advanced social understanding lie in the human ability to understand another's intention. Humans seem to have an affinity for figuring out what others are perceiving, intending, desiring, believing, etc. For example, the use of symbols requires the ability to understand another's action and attention on an entity in the world. However, understanding intentions is unlikely to be a species-specific ability. Tomasello and colleagues argue that it is possible to break down the advanced understanding of shared intentionality into two developmental pathways that eventually become intertwined: # The ability to understand others as goal-directed and intentional agents and # A species-unique tendency to share emotions, events, and activities. Other species, such as great apes, understand the basics of intentionality; however, they do not exhibit behavior that suggests a willingness to engage in shared attention. This claim may be further investigated by examining the functional origins of pointing. It is possible that the pointing exhibited by other species is different in purpose and origin from the pointing said to be indicative of a developing psychological understanding. The former, referred to as imperative pointing, was originally described by Vygotsky (1978) as pointing which begins in an attempt to reach for a desired object. When another retrieves the desired object, the individual learns to associate the gesture (typically hand and all fingers extended outward) with a communicated intention to acquire the desired object. However, research suggests not all points develop in this way. A study by Bates, Camaioni and Volterra (1975) distinguished between imperative and declarative gestures. Imperative gestures were described as those directed at an adult in order to obtain an object, while declarative gestures were those simply intended to obtain adult attention. Both types of gestures are social in nature; however, declarative pointing is thought to be linked to more advanced social understanding. Declarative gestures may involve more complex social and cooperative skills, linked to the development of communication skills (e.g. Liszkowski et al., 2005). For instance, Camaioni and colleagues found that declarative pointing was related to an understanding of adult's intentions, while imperative gestures were not related. According to a social- cultural perspective, it is not the actions of pointing themselves, but the tendency to engage in cooperative actions (as indicated by elements such as shared intentionality and declarative pointing) that determines the advanced social-cognitive status of normally developing humans. These cooperative actions reveal an understanding of intention and may be for the sole purpose of interacting or cooperating rather than achieving an end. It may be that declarative pointing (typically exhibited by normally developing children but not children with autism), rather than imperative pointing, is indicative of the tendency to engage in the cooperative interactions believed to be important for developing advanced social-cognitive understanding. This fits in with Tomasello and colleagues’ conception that triadic social interactions in which child and adult engage in cooperative actions with shared intention are not only indicative of advanced social-cognitive ability but critical to the development of it. During these interactions, children gradually begin to conceptualize both first- and third-person perspectives, gaining a “bird’s eye view” of social interactions. Both the embodiment and social cultural perspectives share the principle that gestures are not just indicators of development, but play an important role in how children come to understand object-directed relations and human intention. Gaze and attentional acts Research suggests that faces are pivotal in offering social cues necessary for children's cognitive, language, and social development. These cues may offer information on another's emotional state, focus of attention, and potential intentions (For a discussion see Mosconi, Mack, McCarthy, & Pelphrey, 2005). Intention may be ascribed to an individual based on where in space that individual is attending. Intention is understood not only through actions and the manipulation of objects, but by tracking eye movements. Research in this area is focused on how humans develop the understanding that eye gaze indicates that the observer may be psychologically connected to the referent. Even as infants, humans are able to follow the gaze of others. Further research has aimed to test whether infants are simply inclined to look in the direction of head movements, without any real understanding of another individual's psychological state. Brooks (1999) found that children do not direct attention simply toward the visual hemisphere of novel head movements; rather, children as young as 15 months attend to object-directed eye gaze, suggesting that children are attending to referents to which others attend, and are not simply gazing in a similar direction. These results support the idea that infants understand eye gaze as an indicator of another individual's psychological state, which is a basic component of understanding that others may have intentions separate from one's own. Biological motion and inferring intention Neuroimaging research suggests that biological motion is processed differently from other types of motion. Biological motion is processed as a category in which individuals are able to infer intention. An evolutionary perspective of this phenomenon is that humans survived on the basis of being able to predict the internal mental states and potential future actions of others. Research on biological motion has found cells in the primate superior temporal polysensory area (STP) that respond specifically to biological motion. In addition, there are brain regions, including the superior temporal sulcus, that respond to biological but not non-biological motion. These findings suggest that humans may have a biologically-based affinity for spotting and interpreting purposeful, biological motions. In one experiment, 18-month-olds observed either a human or a mechanical arm attempting to perform actions, but failing to achieve a goal. The children imitated the action to complete the intended goal when the arm was human, but not when it was mechanical. This suggests that from a young age, humans are able to infer intention specifically as a biological mechanism between motions and goals. Humans have a tendency to infer intention from motion, even in the absence of other distinguishing features (e.g. body shape, emotional expression). This was demonstrated in a study by Heider and Simmel; they had observers view videos of moving triangles, and found that participants tended to attribute intentions and even personality traits to the shapes based on their movements. The movement had to be animate, meaning self-propelled and non-linear. Johansson devised a way to study biological motion without interference from other characteristics of humans such as body shape, or emotional expression. He attached dots of light to actors' joints and recorded the movements in a dark environment, so that only the dots of light were visible. The Johansson figures, as they came to be known, have been used to demonstrate that individuals attribute mental states, such as desires and intentions to movements, that are otherwise disconnected from context. Simulation theory The simulation hypothesis holds that in order to understand intention in others, individuals must observe an action, and then infer the actor's intentions by estimating what their own actions and intentions might be in the situation. Individuals connect their own actions to internal mental states through the experience of sensory information when movements are carried out; this sensory information is stored and connected to one's own intentions. Since internal mental states, such as intention, cannot be understood directly through observing movements, it is hypothesized that these internal states are inferred based on one's own stored representations of those movements. This theory is supported by research on mirror neurons, or neural regions, including the premotor cortex, and parietal cortex, that activate both when individuals are engaging in an action, and when they are observing the actions of others. This suggests individuals may be simulating the motor movements via internal representations of their own motor movements. Thus, research indicates that humans are hard-wired to notice biological motion, infer intention, and use previous mental representations to predict future actions of others. Intentions and behaviors Although human behavior is extremely complex and still remains unpredictable, psychologists are trying to understand the influential factors in the process of forming intentions and performing actions. The theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior are comprehensive theories that specify a limited number of psychological variables that can influence behavior, namely (a) intention; (b) attitude toward the behavior; (c) subjective norm; (d) perceived behavioral control; and (e) behavioral, normative and control beliefs.Fishbein, M., Bandura, A., Triandis, H. C., Kanfer, F. H., Becker, M. H., & Middlestadt, S. E. (1992). Factors influencing behavior and behavior change (Report prepared for the National Institute of Mental Health).Bethesda, MD: National Institute of Mental Health. In the theory of reasoned action, intention is influenced by people's attitude toward performing the behavior and the subjective norm. However, the level of perceived control is believed to be influential on people's behavioral intention along with their attitude and subjective norms, according to the theory of planned behavior. Not surprisingly, in most studies, intention is driven by attitudes to a greater extent than by subjective norms.Eagly, A. H., & Chaiken, S. (1993). The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers The predictive validity of the theory of Reasoned Action has been examined in numerous studies that have previously served as literature for at least three quantitative reviews. Ajzen and Fishbein (1973) reviewed 10 studies and reported a .63 average correlation for the prediction of behavior from intentions and a mean multiple correlation of .76 for the equation predicting intentions from both attitudes and norms. With similar objectives but larger samples, Sheppard et al.'s and van den Putte's meta-analyses estimated correlations of .53 and .62 for the prediction of behavior and multiple correlations of .66 and .68, respectively, for the prediction of intentions.van den Putte, B. (1991). 20 years of the theory of reasoned action of Fishbein and Ajzen: A meta-analysis. Unpublished manuscript. University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands All these studies have reflected the strong correlation that exists between people's attitudes, social norms and their intentions, as well as between their intention and the prediction of their behaviors. However, these correlations do not remain unchanged across all the conditions in people's life. Although people are likely to develop intentions to perform the action in question if they have a favorable attitude and perceive the behavior as controllable, then people's perception of control would be irrelevant to intentions when people have negative attitudes and perceive normative pressure not to perform certain actions. Research has also shown that people are more likely to perform an action if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. Their intentions to perform the action appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors. The very first one is your intention. Whether you have a positive attitude towards drinking as it can help you relieve stress and enjoy your time can greatly influence your attitude towards drinking after work. The next factor is the subjective norms around you. The level of intention to drink after work you are most likely to develop is influenced by whether significant people around you also hold favorable attitudes towards drinking and whether society tends to reward people who can drink. The last factor is the level of perceived behavioral control you have towards your intended behavior, more specifically how much confidence you have in controlling how much you will drink. If all of these factors tend to enhance your intention to have some drinks after work, you are more likely to do so. The longer you maintain the behavior of drinking after work, the stronger and more consistent your original intention will become. As a result, the greater the likelihood you will have some drinks in the future. How people think about and verbally communicate their own intentions also impacts these intentions. For example, asking a question about prior behaviors using the imperfective aspect of language seems to be able to bring out stronger intentions to perform such a behavior in the future. According to the World Atlas of Language Structures, \\"Imperfective Aspects\\" refers to a specific form of language structure used for reference to the present and the future but also for ongoing and habitual events in the past. For example, ‘He writes/is writing/wrote/was writing/will write letters.’Östen Dahl, Viveka Velupillai. 2013. Perfective/Imperfective Aspect. In: Dryer, Matthew S. & Haspelmath, Martin (eds.) The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Retrieved from http://wals.info/chapter/65 on 2015-07-15. People are more likely to interpret the event as ongoing, and likely to resume the action in the future when it has been described with the imperfective verb aspect. Similarly, using present tense to describe an action as ongoing may strengthen intentions to perform the same action in the future.Liroz, F. (2010). Web created by F. Liroz Professor in Spanish Language Department at American School of Madrid, Spain, (date Feb. 6, 2012), http://fernando.liroz.es/m/estverbo.htm Previous research has showed that both information on past behavior and their attitude towards such behavior play crucial roles in predicting people's future behavioral tendency. Recent research done by Carrera and others concluded that verb tense may not have direct influence on intentions, however it could still affect the type of information used as a basis of behavioral intentions.

Early life and family James Stein was closely associated with Scottish nobility. A scion of an important whisky distilling family, he was born c.1804 in Scotland, a son of John Stein (b.1769-c.1814), of Kilbagie, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, a London banker and member 1796-1802 of the House of Commons for Bletchingley. James Stein’s sister, Anne Duff (Stein) (1788-1859), Countess of Fife, was married to General Sir Alexander Duff.Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia, Vol 1. page 191. Their son James was created Baron Skene, whose son Alexander, 1st Duke of Fife, married Princess Louise, eldest daughter of King Edward VII. In 1829, the distillery interests of Stein’s father and uncles, who had earlier been much connected at Canonmills with whisky distillers James and John Haig, struck financial difficulties and all related partnerships were dissolved.Scottish Jurist, 8 June 1829, Vol. 1. pp 227-228. Young James Stein, having the benefit of a good education, then sought to make his own fortune in Australia, arriving at Sydney in September 1833 on the ship Sir John Roe Reid. Australia and overlanding He then engaged in squatting pursuits in New South Wales as a pioneering grazier, firstly in the Goulburn district and then in the Yass district. Being an accomplished cross-country rider, Stein was actively involved in the local hunt club as a participant and organizer of the Argyle Hounds. Along with other 'sporting gentleman' he rode horses in both match races and steeplechases.The Australian, 31 October 1837, page 3. His neighbor and friend at Yass was William Hardy, brother of John Richard Hardy (1807–58), Yass newspaper editor and police magistrate.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hardy-john-richard-3715 In 1839 in Sydney he joined up with several other young gentlemen of the Yass district, namely Charles Campbell, Evelyn Sturt, and William Hardy in a livestock overlanding venture. By then, within this group and more commonly, he was called Jamie Stein. They hired 24 men and during April to July 1839 overlanded 5,000 sheep, as well as 200 head of cattle and twenty horses, from Bathurst to Adelaide, this being the first livestock overlanding party to follow the Murrumbidgee River.The Australian, 23 April 1839, page 2. With 513 ewes from this flock, Stein and Sturt then went into a short-term pastoralism partnership at Meadows, just south of Adelaide. Campbell and Stein then became close business associates, jointly undertaking a further two overland livestock expeditions during 1839-40.South Australian Register, 29 August 1840, page 2. Pastoralism in Mid-North South Australia In 1841, following the 1839 explorations and discoveries of John Hill and Edward John Eyre in South Australia's Mid North, both Campbell and Stein took out occupation licences there and pioneered their own sheep runs. Campbell's was at Hill River, while Stein's run extended from Mount Horrocks, through the Farrell Flat district around the headwaters of the Wakefield River, stretching over surrounding rolling hills and plains to include parts of Burra Creek. Other parts of that creek were on the pastoral run of William Peter of Gum Creek, near present Manoora. Among Stein's shepherds, watching his flocks upon the unfenced run, were several \\"Afghan\\" men, also described as \\"coolies\\", originally brought as servants from India by E.B. Gleeson, a settler at nearby Clare. They are reputed to have named Burra Burra Creek, a part of Stein's run, although this etymology is strongly disputed. It was here that in 1845 William Strear (or Streair), a shepherd employed by Stein, found the ore sample that led to discovery of the fabulously profitable Burra copper mines, although Stein gained no personal profit. Kadlunga Estate The base of Stein’s holdings was Kadlunga homestead, which he founded in a vale beneath Mount Horrocks, about three kilometres west of present Mintaro. An early partner (and successor) in Stein’s Mid North pastoralism ventures was John Oakden, a nephew of Colonial Treasurer Osmond Gilles. At times Oakden managed Kadlunga Station for Stein, while at other times he leased it from Stein (or from Stein’s creditors). Stein participated prominently in community life in the Mid North, including as a promoter and judge of horseracing events, magistrate, and (until his resignation in 1853) as Justice of the Peace. Not wishing to seem partisan, he participated in multiple fraternal lodges including Oddfellows and Freemasonry. He was fondly remembered as 'the life and soul' of any celebration.Tolmer, Alexander, Reminiscences, etc, (London, 1882) Vol. 1., pp 149-150. During that period, despite apparent wealth and influence, he carried increasing debts and mortgaged his wide-ranging estate. His declaration of insolvency in September 1848 was an irreparable step.Register, 9 September 1848, page 3. His Kadlunga Station later became a merino sheep stud and Percheron horse stud, being successively owned by John Chewings (1816–79), Sir Samuel Way (1836-1916), and then Sir John Melrose (1860-1938).Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia, Vol 1. page 183. Impoverished later life In the mid-1850s Stein moved to the South East of South Australia. For the next twenty years, in contrast to the sharp dress, wealth, and eminence of his early life, Stein’s life was marked by destitution and then invalidity. Nevertheless, he was an aristocrat to the end, recognised for maintaining a proud, gentlemanly, and genial demeanour, while still being visited by influential friends.Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia, Vol 2. page 32. Employed as a humble pound keeper at The Springs Ponds near Millicent, he enforced the Livestock Impounding Act while residing in a mere hut. Suffering prolonged feeble health, he died at Mount Gambier on 27 October 1877, aged 73 years.Border Watch newspaper, 31 October 1877, page 2. There is no record that he had ever married. His detailed biography and portrait appear in Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia.Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia, Vol 2. page 32. His portrait photograph is also held by the State Library of South Australia. Legacy The original picturesque stone homestead buildings of Kadlunga estate, founded by Stein, remain a tribute to pioneer builders. The reputation of Kadlunga became much enhanced in the hands of later owners as a place of Australian national significance, being a famed sheep, cattle, and horse stud associated with a succession of prominent South Australians, each adding intrinsic architectural features. Kadlunga was listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1978. Stein Hill, 605m, a prominence in the north Mount Lofty Ranges about 7.5 kilometres south east of Burra, bears his name. Stein Hill is part of the Stein Hill Land System which represents the east facing slopes of the Burra Hills south of the Burra - Morgan road.

The theory  According to Leroux, human excrement has remarkable fertilising properties, which society fails to harness. The human waste that is otherwise discarded would fertilise agricultural production sufficient to cover society's progressively increasing food consumption.[Pierre Jannet, J. F. Payen, Auguste Alexandre Veinant] Bibliotheca Scatologica, ou catalogue raisonné des livres traitant des vertus faits et gestes de très noble et très ingénieux [Paris: Imprimerie Guiraudet et Jouaust, 1849], p. 79. Leroux posits the existence of a natural law dependent on the circulation of human excrement back through the agricultural process and which maintains a necessary balance between soil fertility and inexorable population growth.Bibliotheca Scatologica, p. 79. In the Revue de l'ordre social (No. 1, 1850, p. 6), Leroux responded to his critics, summing up his theory as follows: \\"Si les hommes étaient croyants, savants, religieux, ajoute-t-il, au lieu de rire, comme ils le font, du socialisme, ils professeraient avec respect et vénération la doctrine du circulus. Chacun recueillerait religieusement son fumier pour le donner à l’état, c’est-à-dire au percepteur, en guise d’impôt ou de contribution personelle. La production agricole serait immédiatement doublée, et la misère disparaîtrait du globe\\"Quoted in Bibliotheca Scatologica, p. 79. (If men were believers, learned, religious, then, rather than laughing at socialism, as they do, they would profess the doctrine of circulus with respect and veneration. Each would religiously collect his dung to give it to the state, that is, to the tax- collector, by way of an impost or personal contribution. Agricultural production would instantly be doubled, and poverty would vanish from the globe).  Origin and history of the theory  Leroux first put forward his theory of circulus in 1834, as part of an attempt to explain the failure of a Fourierist phalanstery.Donald Reid, Paris Sewers and Sewermen: Realities and Representations, Harvard University Press, 1991, p. 54. In response to Madame Baudet-Dulary, astonished at the failure of the utopian community established on her land, Fourier himself is supposed to have said: \\"Madame, donnez-moi fumier\\" (Madame, give me dung).Dominique Laporte, Histoire de la Merde, Christian Bourgois, Editeur, Paris, 1978, p. 111. Despite public ridicule,See for example Alfred Sudre, who derides Leroux's theory in Histoire du communisme: ou, Réfutation historique des utopies socialistes (4th edition, Alfred Pagny, Éditeur, Brussels, 1850, p. 309), as follows: \\"M. Pierre Leroux s’écrie: Pour renverser le Léviathan de l’économie politique, il me suffit… d’un détritus\\" (Monsieur Pierre Leroux cries out: to overturn the Leviathan of the political economy, all I need is... a piece of waste). Leroux held firm to his theory in the decades that followed and, while living in exile in Jersey after the fall of the Second Republic, he carried out experiments using his own excrement as fertiliser in an attempt to persuade the local authorities to adopt the doctrine of circulus.Paris Sewers and Sewermen, p. 55. However, Leroux's theory did gain the sympathetic ear of fellow exile Victor Hugo.Paris Sewers and Sewermen, p. 55. In the digression on the sewers of Paris in Les Misérables,\\"L'intestin de Léviathan\\", Book Five, Part Two. Hugo would seem to have been influenced by Leroux's diagnosis of socio-economic ills when he declares that the present sewerage system is \\"a misunderstanding\\" (\\"Un égout est un malentendu\\"), a negligent waste (\\"coulage\\") of public wealth (\\"la richesse publique\\"), and that were the \\"givens of a new social economy\\" (\\"les données d'une économie sociale nouvelle\\") applied to human waste, then the problem of poverty would be attenuated.Les Misérables, ed. Guy Rosa and Nicole Savy, Le Livre de Poche, 1985, vol. 2, p. 1685. But in practical terms, rather than by Leroux's vision of individual members of society willingly paying a tax in their own excrement for the sake of the common weal, Hugo's collector sewers were sooner inspired by the ideas of English social reformer Edwin Chadwick, who proposed that human waste be pumped from cities to the countryside to provide fertiliser for crops to feed those very cities, thereby completing \\"the circle and [realising] the Egyptian type of eternity by bringing as it were the serpent's tail into the serpent's mouth\\".Quoted in Paris Sewers and Sewermen, p. 56.

The border between the modern states of Switzerland and Italy extends for ,National boundary (swisstopo) from the French-Swiss-Italian tripoint at Mont Dolent in the west to the Austrian-Swiss-Italian tripoint near Piz Lad in the east. Much of the border runs across the High Alps, rising above as it passes east of Dufourspitze, but it also descends to the lowest point in Switzerland as it passes Lago Maggiore at below . History The border is a product of the Napoleonic period, established with the provisional constitution of the Helvetic Republic of 15 January 1798, restored in 1815. While this border existed as a border of Switzerland from 1815, there was only a unified Italian state to allow the existence of a \\"Swiss-Italian border\\" with the formation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, it previously comprised the borders between Switzerland and the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia and the province of Cisleithania of Austria-Hungary. There remained some territorial disputes after the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, resolved in the Convenzione tra l'Italia e la Svizzera per l'accertamento della frontiera fra la Lombardia ed il Cantone dei Grigioni of 1863.original text at admin.ch Other Swiss-Italian treaties regarding the course of the border date to 1873/4,BS 11 83, SR 0.132.454.1 1936/7SR 0.132.454.1 / AS 1969 1308 and 1941.0.132.454.2, Abkommen zwischen der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft und dem Königreich Italien über die Festlegung der italienisch-schweizerischen Grenze auf der Strecke zwischen Run Do oder Cima Garibaldi und Mont Dolent, 24 July 1941 Since 1946, it has remained unchanged as the border between the Italian Republic and the Swiss Confederacy, with the exception of minor corrections and exchanges of territory, such as the inclusion of the Lago di Lei barrage in Switzerland in the 1950s.treaty of 1952, ratified 1953 (Switzerland) and 1955 (Italy), entered into effect in 1955. In 2008 Switzerland became part of the Schengen Area, meaning that border controls were removed along this border as of 12 December 2008. However, while border guards from both countries are no longer allowed to stop travellers for the sole purpose of passport checks, they can still carry out customs checks, as Switzerland is not in the EU Customs Union. Detailed path The border as shown by Swisstopomap.geo.admin.ch separates the Swiss canton of Valais from the Italian Aosta Valley and Piedmont region, the canton of Ticino from Piedmont and Lombardy, and the canton of Grisons from Lombardy and South Tyrol. Running east from Mont Dolent, the border touches Grand Golliat and the Great St Bernard Pass and then visits a series of three-thousander peaks including Mont Velan, Mont Brulé and Tête Blanche before rising to at Dent d'Herens and to at Matterhorn, followed by Furgghorn, Breithorn, Zwillinge, Monte Rosa at , and Grenzgipfel just east of Dufourspitze at . The border now encircles the Italian Domodossola valley, passing Gonda, Monte Leone, Bortelhorn, Helsenhorn, traversed by the Simplon Tunnel connecting Brig with Varzo, Grieshorn just south of Nufenen Pass, and forming the western border of Ticino runs across Marchhorn, Basodino, Pizzo Fiorera, Wandfluhhorn, Pizzo Quadro, Pizzo di Porcaresc, Pilone and descends below running across Centovalli along a stretch of the Melezza. It rises again to Pilone peak before descending to Lago Maggiore between Brissago and Cannobio, on the left bank making landfall at Caviano and passing west of Lugano and the villages of Malcantone to Ponte Tresa at Lake Lugano. It then forms the southernmost corner of Switzerland including Chiasso, turning north again outside of Como and now forming the eastern border of Ticino running west of Lake Como, of passing Lake Lugano again west of Lugano and touching Monte Boglia, Cima di Fojorina, Gazzirola, Cima di Cugn, Pizzo Campanile, again reaching at Pizzo Quadro between Val Mesolcina and Chiavenna, and further north to Pizzo Tambo, Splügen Pass and Piz Timun. The Swiss-Italia border here has the peculiarity of including the reservoir of Lago di Lei in Italy but in an artificial salient including the reservoir's dam in Switzerland. Turning south again it traverses Val Bregaglia at Castasegna and turns east towards Cima di Castello, now forming the northern border of the Valtellina, a territory that was lost by the Three Leagues in 1797 with the formation of the Cisalpine Republic. Val Poschiavo remains part of Grisons, and is separated from Valtellina by the border passing just north of Tirano, turning north again along Piz Paradisin, Munt Cotschen, Piz da l'Acqua to the inclusion of Livigno in Italy. The border now follows the southern watershed of Val Müstair, touching Piz Murtaröl, Piz Tea Fondada, Piz Schumbraida, Piz Umbrail until it reaches the pass road connecting Vinschgau with the Valtellina and Stilfserjoch. The border now turns north for a final stretch separating Val Müstair and the Engadin from Vinschgau, South Tyrol, terminating at the Austrian-Swiss-Italian tripoint just north of Piz Lad. Illegal immigration In 2016, due to increased illegal immigration from Italy into Switzerland related to the European migrant crisis, the Swiss government cracked down on the practice, establishing more stringent controls in Swiss-bound trains and deploying helicopter and drone patrols. The government rejected calls to build a fence along the border. In April 2017, the Italian foreign ministry called the Swiss ambassador for \\"urgent talks\\" after Switzerland decided to close \\"three minor border crossings\\" during night hours.

Sell, associate professor at Drexel University School of Public Health, and was published online at OutHistory in March 2014. The essay is notable for the insights it provides into gay life, including slang, sexual practices, and relationships, in the United States during the 1930s and before, based on what Bernstein learned from his gay friends and acquaintances as well as on his wide reading and research in literary and sociological sources. LGBT historian and author Jonathan Ned Katz calls the extended essay \\"a rich document of homosexual American history\\" and notes that \\"as a sociological, anthropological, and historical survey and personal polemic, [it] anticipates and most resembles a book published eleven years after it: The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach (1951), by the married sociologist Edward Sagarin, using the pseudonym Donald Webster Cory. Like Sagarin, Bernstein accepted many of the negative clichés about homosexuals, but argued that they should not be persecuted under the law.\\" Personal life Bernstein was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, to Joseph and Rose Simon Bernstein, both of East European Jewish descent. Bernstein grew up in Salem, Massachusetts, where he graduated from high school. After Rose died in 1928 and Joseph in 1929, Bernstein and his older brother Haskell were adopted by an aunt and uncle in Albany, New York. Bernstein attended Tufts College for one year, then transferred to Union College, from which he graduated in 1933. He then spent a year at the University of Chicago, graduating with a master's degree in history in 1934. Bernstein was unable to find permanent work during the Depression, and went through a succession of temporary jobs. In January 1938, he was hired to write on history and architecture for the Federal Writers Project guidebook to the state of Massachusetts, a job he held for the statutory maximum of 18 months. In September 1940, Bernstein enlisted in the United States Army, initially being stationed in Staten Island, New York, and then was assigned to write training manuals for the Quartermaster Corps in Camp Lee, Virginia, with the rank of staff sergeant, and was eventually awarded a Good Conduct Medal. In January 1944, following an attempt to pick up a fellow soldier after attending a performance of the Ballets Russes in Richmond, Virginia, Bernstein was arrested by military police and summarily jailed, and then transferred to a psychiatric ward on base, pending his less- than-honorable blue discharge for homosexuality four weeks later. After his discharge, Bernstein eventually took a job teaching at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire, and later worked as a labor market analyst for the Maine Department of Labor, settling in Augusta, Maine, a job from which he retired in 1978. In 1946, Bernstein married Anne Fine, and subsequently had two sons, Gerald and Robert. Bernstein came out to his fiancée when he proposed to her, as he described in a 2003 interview: > I met this nice middle-class Jewish girl from the Boston area, through one > of the Nashua, New Hampshire cousins, and we clicked. It was terrific. We > were both products of the 30s, in our own early 30s. Quote, \\"I'm gay. Will > you marry me?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Although Congress scrapped the blue discharges in 1947, veterans who had received them were still ineligible for any G. I. Bill benefits or assistance from the Veterans Administration. Beginning in March 1944, Bernstein began a series of appeals of his blue discharge, doggedly refiling his appeals after repeated rebuffs from the Army, until he was finally granted a retroactive honorable discharge in 1981. To his first appeal in 1944, Bernstein attached a copy of Millions of Homos, which lay ignored and forgotten until 2010, when it was fortuitously discovered by Randall Sell in the National Library of Medicine in Washington, D. C. After Anne's death in 1991, Bernstein came out to his sons and for the next two decades was an active volunteer in numerous service organizations and gay-rights groups, including the Red Cross, American Veterans for Equal Rights, and the Maine Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance (now EqualityMaine), among others. In 1948, Bernstein had begun work at Harvard on a doctoral degree in education, but when university officials questioned his blue discharge and he told them it was for homosexuality, he was asked to leave the program. Not long before his death in 2008, Bernstein told his sons that he had willed his brain to Harvard Medical School, saying \\"If I could not get into Harvard when I was alive, at least my brain will get in.\\" Writings Except as noted, all were unpublished during Bernstein's lifetime: * \\"A Pervert Talks Back\\" (1938) * \\"They Didn't Mean Us\\" (1938) * Millions of Queers (Our Homo America) (1940) * Poems Partly Pederastic (1941) – a collection of 13 poems self-published by Bernstein * \\"My Blue Sec. 8 Discharge\\" (1944) – submitted as an open letter to Common Sense in 1944, but not accepted for publication * Letter to the Adjunct General of the U.S. Army, now in the archives of Common Sense at Yale University (1944) * Letter to the editor published in the Portland, Maine, Press Herald (1993) Published interviews: * with Mary Ann Humphrey, published in her book My Country, My Right To Serve (1990) * with Joan Radner for the Library of Congress, Veterans History Project (2002) External links * Millions of Queers (Our Homo America) – copy of original typescript (10.7 MB) * Millions of Queers (Our Homo America) – searchable text version (787 KB) References Category:1913 births Category:People from Nashua, New Hampshire Category:Military personnel from New Hampshire Category:Gay writers Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:LGBT Jews Category:2008 deaths Category:Jewish American military personnel Category:American military personnel discharged for homosexuality Category:American LGBT military personnel Category:People prosecuted under anti-homosexuality laws Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:LGBT people from New Hampshire ","title":"Allen Irvin Bernstein"},{"id":"44526448","text":"Tiparra Reef (also spell as Tipara) is a reef located in Spencer Gulf in South Australia about west of the town of Port Hughes.

Most patients are supposed to be able to choose the clinician whom they want to provide them with healthcare and that money to pay for the service should follow their choice. Before the advent of the internal market, in principle, a GP could refer a patient to any specialist in the UK. When contracts were introduced in 1990 these were called extracontractual referrals. From 1999 the concept of Out of Area Treatments was developed. These referrals were not necessarily related to choice made by a patient. Specialised treatments were not, and are not, available in every area. The regulations provide that a patient can choose to be seen by any NHS trust, public body, commercial organisation or third sector body, provided it holds a “commissioning contract” either with NHS England or a Clinical Commissioning Group when they are referred by their GP, community dentist or optometrist for treatment that is not identified as being immediately required. The Government’s mandate to NHS England for 2016-17 issued by Jeremy Hunt specifies “We want people to be empowered to shape and manage their own health and care and make meaningful choices, particularly for maternity services, people with long term conditions and end- of-life care”. History * 2002 - Patient choice pilots begin. Patients with coronary disease are offered faster care from alternative providers * 2003 - All NHS patients likely to wait more than six months for inpatient treatment, offered choice of quicker treatment at alternative provider * January 2006 - patients referred to hospital could choose between at least four hospitals. * April 2006 – launch of extended choice – patients have access to a national menu of hospitals including NHS foundation trusts, independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) and independent sector (IS) providers on what is known as the Extended Choice Network. * July 2007 – launch of Free Choice at a specialty level – patients have free choice in orthopaedics. * December 2007 - patients have free choice in general surgery, gynaecology and cardiology. * April 2008 - Under what is known as Free Choice policy, most patients have been able to choose services from any hospital provider that is clinically appropriate and meets NHS standards and costs, including NHS foundation trusts, acute trusts and many independent sector providers and their hospitals. * December 2012 National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012 * April 2014 policy extended to mental health. Guidance says \\"This means having a right to choose which team, led by a named healthcare professional, delivers their care and treatment. * October 2014 the Five Year Forward View asserts \\"We will make good on the NHS’ longstanding promise to give patients choice over where and how they receive care”. Exceptions to policy Around 80% patients referred by their GP to a first outpatient hospital appointment were eligible to choose the hospital. There are however some exceptions to hospital choice policy. These exceptions include those where speed of access is important such as suspected cancer 2 week wait referrals and urgent referrals such as suspected stroke and heart attack. Referrals to mental health and maternity services were excluded from the policy until April 2014. Patients who are detained, and serving members of the armed forces are not entitled to exercise choice. NHS Constitution The NHS Constitution includes a right to choice. It states: You have the right to make choices about your NHS care and to information to support these choices. The options available to you will develop over time and depend on your individual needs. It also repeats the requirements specified in the GP contract: You have the right to choose your GP practice, and to be accepted by that practice unless there are reasonable grounds to refuse, in which case you will be informed of those reasons. You have the right to express a preference for using a particular doctor within your GP practice, and for the practice to try to comply. CCG and NHS England are required by the regulations to “make arrangements” to give effect to the right of patients to exercise their patient choice. It is for the clinician making the referral to decide whether it is clinically appropriate. The right to choice only extends to a first appointment. It does not imply that any chosen treatment must be paid for. That would depend on the terms of the provider's contract. Spire Healthcare complained to Monitor (NHS) in 2013 that the Clinical Commissioning Groups in Blackpool, and in Fylde and Wyre were not doing enough to encourage patient choice, but their complaint was dismissed in September 2014. Comparing hospitals It is intended that patients can choose the hospital they are seen in by comparing clinical quality, waiting times, location and other patients' opinions. In order to enable patients to compare and choose hospitals the national NHS website established a hospital comparison tool. The information that users can access to compare hospital performance can include: * The number of procedures carried out * Waiting times * Average time spent in hospital * Patient outcomes (Readmission rates) * Rates of infection * Overall hospital performance (Care Quality Commission Statistics) * What patients say about their overall care * What visitors to www.nhs.uk say * Results from the national survey of inpatients * Quality of food * Car parking * Disabled access Using the hospital comparison tool is supposed to be quite simple. Users enter their postcode and the condition that they are being referred for. =Booking appointments= IN 2005 an electronic booking service known as Choose and Book was introduced across the NHS in England. This service enabled GPs and patients to shortlist a list of clinically appropriate hospitals for the patient to choose from, and lets the patient make appointments with hospitals either online or over the phone. Choose and Book was based around Directory of Services which includes the majority of NHS hospital services for GPs to shortlist for their patients to choose from. GPs were given financial incentives to use the system Choose and Book was replaced by the NHS e-Referral Service in June 2015. Maternity services The 1993 report, Changing Childbirth, called choice, control, and continuity of carer for the mother as the most important tenets of maternity care, but its recommendations were not delivered. Baroness Cumberlege conducted a review of maternity services for NHS England in 2015. Better Births, the report of the national maternity review recommended that all women should have the choice to give birth where they want, with the support of the same midwife throughout pregnancy, labour and the early weeks of motherhood, with control over a personal maternity care budget of £3,000 to be spent on the NHS care they choose. This would be driven by a personal care plan, updated during pregnancy. Every woman should have an electronic patient record which they can access and add to. Performance The proportion of patients who reported that they were offered a choice of provider rose steadily until 2010 when 32% of those responding to the inpatient survey reported that they had been offered a choice. By 2013 the proportion had fallen to 27%.

SDSN Southeast Asia Regional Hub (SDSN-SEA) SDSN networks around the world are platforms to promote and share sustainable development solutions that can be put into practice. They are crucial for the continued improvement of emerging economies in ASEAN in a way that minimizes negative impact on the environment, generates employment and inclusive growth, and helps to eradicate poverty. SDSN-SEA and SDSN Indonesia were launched in October 2013 by the then President of the Republic of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with Prof Jeffrey Sachs (Director of the Earth Institute of Columbia University and Special Consultant to UN Director-General Ban Ki-moon) and Mari Pangestu (the then Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia).

Both are members of the SDSN Leadership Council Tri Hita Karana’ Philosophy and the SDSN Goals > “Humanitarian response, sustainable development and sustaining peace are > three sides of the same triangle”. UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterre, December 2017 SDSN-SEA seeks to promote the UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals through the Balinese cultural lens of “Tri Hita Karana”, which literally means “Three Ways to Happiness” through the harmonies of people with people, people with nature and people with the spiritual. The Tri Hita Karana SDG Pyramid concept aligns the 17 Goals in a holistic three tiers signifying the need for a harmonious relationship within and across the three realms to create a better and happier world. The first ten Goals (SDG 1 to 10) represent the harmony of people with people and address social issues such as poverty, education, and health. The next five Goals (SDG 11 to 15) represent harmony with nature and address sustainability in urbanization, climate change, and biodiversity. Finally, the last two Goals (SDG 16 & 17) represent harmony with the spiritual calling for inner strength and faith to bridge peace and collaboration within and across sectors and countries. The harmonies across the three realms of social, ecological and the spiritual represent universal values. These same values are shared by other cultures such as the Chinese, Hindu, Islam and Greek for the attainment of peace and prosperity. The bridging of these pathways — the social, ecological and spiritual — in bringing forth the happiness of individuals and societies form the core of many of SDSN-SEA's programs. 2014 Regional Workshop (Partnership for Solutions) SDSN Regional Workshop (SEA, Indonesia and Australia / Pacific) The first Regional Workshop was jointly hosted by SDSN- SEA, SDSN Indonesia and SDSN Australia / Pacific. It was held in Jakarta in November 2014 and brought together leaders and experts from academia, government, business and civil society. The main partner was the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of Indonesia led by Minister Siti Nurbaya. Organizing partners were the University Indonesia Research Center for Climate Change, United in Diversity Forum (UID), Monash University in partnership with the Carbon War Room, the Australia–Indonesia Centre and the Harold Mitchell Foundation. The regional workshop primarily focused on identifying an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for Indonesia. It also looked at how progress can be measured, focusing especially on the current UN proposal for the Sustainable Development Goals. Much of the discussion was on Indonesia's future energy needs, identifying how they can be met in line with decarbonizing the energy system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and developing plans for collaborative solution initiatives.

The forum consists of a five-day workshop session where participants are equipped with skills to trigger personal and inclusive social transformation.  Happiness Festival  The Happiness Festival is hosted annually in Jakarta with support from the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), SDSN Southeast Asia, Project Semesta, and United in Diversity (UID). The festival is inspired by the SDG Pyramid to Happiness, an initiative led by the UID which frames the 17 SDGs according to the three Pathways to Happiness rooted in the ancient Balinese belief of Tri Hita Karana. The Happiness Festival aims to encourage every level of society and stakeholders to actively participate and take action in fulfilling the SDGs and solve the disharmony of social, ecological, and spiritual relationships occurring in Indonesia.  Re-weaving Indonesia's Future Dialogue “Merajut Masa Depan Indonesia”  The purpose of the Future Dialogue is to rebuild trust among the diverse communities and institutions of Indonesia to achieve a future for our common good, aligned with the UID vision defined at its conception 15 years ago. At the time, in the aftermath of the 1998 financial crises and the Bali Bomb tragedy, UID was founded to rebuild trust between the Government, the business sector, and the civil society, along with their respective related institutions. * How can we collectively prepare Indonesian human resources to readily respond to the Government's aspirations for national character building? * How can the private sector and civil society work hand-in-hand in creating a sustainable, just and inclusive country? * How do we learn to listen and understand the aspirations of the younger generations who will inherit all that we have left behind? * How can the private sector and the business community adopt ethical and responsible business practices in order to create a Better Business Better World --- a sustainable and happy world for all. The dialogue uses an approach adopted by UID for the past 15 years in its tri-sector (Government - Business - Civil Society) leadership training programmes, namely the Theory U and Systems approach of Open Mind - Open Heart - Open Will. The dialogue evokes, amongst others, the local spirit of \\"gotong royong\\" (the voluntary act of shouldering and solving problems together) and tolerance which have been the sustaining pillars of Indonesia's resilience.  The THK Bali Forum  The ‘Tri Hita Karana (THK) Forum for Sustainable Development’ with the theme of ‘Blended Finance and Innovation for Better Business Better World’ was launched in Bali around the 2018 IMF World Bank Annual Meetings. It takes place every two years. Held under the patronage of the Government of Indonesia, the aim of the THK Forum is to accelerate global action for the UN Sustainable Development Goals with the use of blended financing to mobilize private sector engagement. The first forum launched over 30 high impact projects, and mobilized up to US$10 billion for priority SDGs sectors including green infrastructure, sustainable land use, oceans, women, ecotourism and innovation in Indonesia and globally. Notable initiatives launched or catalysed by the THK Forum include: # A first-of-its-kind integrated funding platform “SDG Indonesia One”. This was launched by PT SMI, Indonesia's infrastructure finance unit under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance, to support large-scale sustainable infrastructure projects in Indonesia. SDG Indonesia One has since raised $2.46 billion in commitment. # The Billion Dollar Fund for Women. This is a global consortium of venture funds tackling the gender funding gap. Launched with around US$500 million, the initiative has already exceeded its US$1 billion target. It has seen a number of investments in high impact women- funded companies, including a number of high impact companies in Indonesia. # The Tri Hita Karana Roadmap for Blended Finance. This is a set of principles championed by the Indonesian Government and THK partners which seek to define a shared value system for the effective deployment of blended finance to support the delivery of the SDGs.  The Blended Finance and Innovation Institute (BFI)  The ambitious BFI Institute aims to overcome barriers that prevent capital from flowing to SDG-related projects in emerging markets. The BFI Institute hopes to align global partners to support the incubation of innovative financing for inclusive business and the SDGs, seeks to overcome barriers to investing in high-impact sectors in emerging markets, creates a hub of best practice for developing country infrastructure finance institutions, accelerates on-ground pipeline development (especially for natural solutions, clean energy and circular economy), and convenes leaders around catalytic financial instruments to crowd in commercial investment at scale. The institute will create shared institutional learnings across stakeholders, match-make capital to projects, catalyse leadership and forge new collaboration between public, private, civil society and academia to scale up innovation and investment for sustainable and inclusive development. The BFI Institute is expected to be officially launched in November 2020.  IDEAS  IDEAS which stands for (Innovative, Dynamic, Education and Action for Sustainability) is a collaboration between MIT and UID to implement the goals in actionable projects using the philosophy of U-theory. IDEAS Indonesia's work is aligned with SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals) asnd focuses on developing collective leadership capacity across the pillars of society. Knowing how massive and complex are our challenges of sustainable development, this capacity is critical to accelerate impact through impactful collaboration and communication between government, business, and civil society. In collaboration with MIT Sloan School of Management, each cohort of IDEAS Indonesia takes thirty prominent society leaders and thought influencers from all walks of life, crossing disciplinary and sectoral boundaries, and guides them on a learning journey to investigate deeply the systemic forces operating on our current reality, with a special focus on reflective process to understand how each sector can play a role in co-shaping a different future. These insights then serve as a guide to hatch and incubate collaborative solutions to overcome systemic hurdles holding back our society from reaching its highest future potentials as envisioned with the SDG goals. The program also relies on a strategy of growing a critical mass of alumni comprising leaders with the capacity to initiate and foster collaborative action. As IDEAS Indonesia grows, its strong alumni has continued to steward other initiatives in their own context and sector, slowly evolving society with them.

Founding It was founded in December 1879 by former Cape Argus editor Patrick McLoughlin, as an outlet for his radical liberal opposition to British imperialism. Officially, the paper's purpose was to encourage spontaneous unity in southern Africa, to counter the Colonial office's scheme to impose a system of British-ruled confederation on the region. While McLoughlin served as business manager, he co-edited it with the controversial firebrand Francis Reginald Statham who had been invited to Cape Town especially for this purpose. Both men also did much of the writing. The offices were based in Cape Town.DP McCracken: Irish journalists in South Africa: Imperial running dogs or wild geese reporters? Historia 58, 1. 2013. pp 122-138.S. Haw: Bearing witness: the Natal Witness, 1846–1996. 1996. Political controversy Although the paper received strong support from powerful local leaders like Saul Solomon, John Molteno, Charles Fairbridge and John X. Merriman, it was under strong imperial pressure, and went against the prevailing mood in much of the Cape Colony. At the time, the inclusive Molteno Government had just been overthrown, and British control (in the form of a proposed \\"Confederation\\") was being solidified across southern Africa. Resulting wars were flaring up from the Transvaal (1st Boer War) and Transkei (9th Frontier War) to Zululand (Anglo-Zulu War). Public opinion had become strongly militant since these events, and the new publication came under sustained attack - legal and public. Controversy arose quickly during the notorious \\"Koegas affair\\" (1879–80). This concerned the murder of San people (Bushmen) by farmers, near the northern frontier. In the subsequent murder trial, the farmers were acquitted, and the resulting outrage focused on Attorney General Thomas Upington. The Cape Argus and Cape Post accused Upington of deliberately allowing the trial to take place in a racist and hostile town that would be expected to acquit the murderers, due to prejudice and local influence. The culmination of the outrage was a public campaign, led by the Cape Post editors among others, accusing Upington and his colleagues of allowing white juries to acquit white murderers from murdering blacks.https://archive.org/stream/mylifesrecordaf01statgoog/mylifesrecordaf01statgoog_djvu.txt Closure The paper quickly ran into financial difficulties and was forced to close in 1880.

It was the first Church album in five years, during which time founding guitarist Marty Willson-Piper moved to Sweden and was replaced by former Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug. Kilbey said Haug was asked to join the band on the album only after he had tried for six months to contact Willson-Piper. \\"Marty wasn't kicked out or asked to leave. He went to Sweden and when I started writing to him to say let's make an album, he didn't even write back. I tried to contact him by every known means and he didn't reply, so we say he is 'unavailable'.\\" He said drummer Tim Powles had suggested Haug—a fan of The Church since his teenage years—as a new guitarist. Haug joined the band in Sydney to record and in five days co-wrote more than 20 songs. \\"Ian's enthusiasm re-energised us,\\" Kilbey said. \\"I'm not blaming Marty for this, but a certain cynicism and scepticism was shattered when Ian joined the band. Ian's all over this record; he's the prime mover behind a lot of the songs. He was always there with his guitar strapped on, suggesting 'What about this?', overdub after overdub. It's very inspiring to be part of that.\\" He told Rolling Stone: \\"We knew he was a great player but we didn't know if we could work with him. As soon as he turned up, then Peter arrived 10 minutes later, the three of us cooked up 'Miami'. We wrote it quickly and without any pain or bloodshed, so I have a real fond spot for this (song). In concert we've been doing it as the last song and it's just been slaying people. It's just what the doctor ordered for The Church. A new epic.\\" Kilbey described Further/Deeper as \\"a very energetic, up-tempo record that is very complex musically\\". He told the Sydney Morning Herald: \\"We've really explored all the parameters of what The Church could be while still remaining The Church and kind of pushing the boundaries of where our music could go and what we could do with the lyrics, the vocals and instrumentation.\\" In late 2014 The Church played numerous Australian gigs at which they played the full album. A similar tour of the USA followed in Feb 2015, with selected past songs added at various gigs. The band returned to the US in the Summer of 2015 for a co- headline tour with the Psychedelic Furs. The album was released in the US with 12 tracks and overseas with 15 tracks.

After being commander of sekban (peasant mercenaries) units in Anatolia, he was appointed first to position of sanjakbey and serçeşme of the Sanjak of Karahisar-i Sahib. In 1687 for a couple of months he was also the beylerbey of Rumelia Eyalet, which was the highest position he held.  Career  = Reign of Mehmed IV = Yeğen Osman was commander of all Anatolian sekbans. Rivalries between the janissaries and the sekbans ultimately resulted in a rebellion. After the janissaries had been defeated on the Rumelian front, they marched on Istanbul in 1687 to depose Mehmed IV. The latter took actıon to marry his daughter to Yeğen Osman and appointed him to hold the janissaries in check. In 1687 Yeğen Osman was appointed as sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Karahisar-i Sahib in exchange for providing support to the sultan with 5,000 of his men. At his insistence, he was also appointed as security chief (serçeşme) of this province. Instead to bring his forces to the front, by the middle of May 1687 he brought around 4,000 men to Istanbul and instead to defeat forces that threaten the sultan, they actually additionally threaten him. Only 1,500 of his men were sent to the front at the end of June. To satisfy appetites of ambitious Yeğen Osman and win his support the sultan made him beylerbey of Rumelia Eyalet with seat in Sofia and responsible for exceptionally important front toward Holy League. Yeğen Osman de facto remained on the position until 1689 and treated the territories he controlled as his personal fiefdom. He increased taxes to unbearable level to earn as much money as possible for himself, though he regularly denied this when he was faced with criticism. = Reign of Suleyman II =  Rebellion  Mehmed IV to be succeeded by Suleyman II who continued the policy of his predecessor towards sekbans. Yeğen Osman, as Rumelian beylerbey, rebelled against new sultan and became the main enemy of the Ottoman government. All dissatisfied sekbans gathered around him, including many from Anatolia. The sultan offered him the position of serasker of Timișoara, but he refused. Sultan appointed him as sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Bosnia and Yeğen's uncle as sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Herzegovina, but this did not satisfy his ambitions so his forces of 10,000 men continued to plunder the territories under his control, including the Ottoman Serbia and Greece. According to some sources, Yeğen Osman had more money than Ottoman treasury. In 1688 his forces, notorious because of the robbing of the population, robbed the treasury of Serbian Patriarchate of Peć hidden in Gračanica monastery. According to one letter written by Catholic bishop Peter Bogdani, Yeğen Osman Pasha threatened to cut off the head of Archbishop of Peć and Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojević because he received money from Austrians to instigate anti-Ottoman rebellion of Orthodox Serbs. To bring Yeğen Osman to heels new sultan appointed Yeğen Osman on the position of governor of Belgrade in 1688. This appointment angered Yeğen Osman, because this position was subordinated to Ottoman serdar of Hungary, Hasan Pasha. He insisted that his new position would not make him subordinated to Ottoman serdar of Hungary, nor porte itself. The struggle over position of serdar of Hungary caused deep hatred between Hasan Pasha and Yeğen Osman. When Yeğen Osman went to Belgrade with his forces he forcefully deposed Hasan Pasha by capturing his camp on the Vračar hill and putting him into prison.  Siege of Belgrade 1688  Siege of Belgrade in 1688 When the Holy Roman Empire forces besieged Belgrade in 1688, the emperor sent a letter to Yeğen Osman and offered him Wallachia to desert Ottomans and switch to their side. Since Yeğen Osman requested all of Slavonia and Bosnia, they did not make an agreement. Austrians positioned ponton bridges near Ostružnica and crossed Sava with 10,000 forces. Yeğen Osman attacked them with bulk of his forces, but Austrians repelled his two attacks, captured more land on the right bank of Sava and brought additional forces. When Yeğen Osman realized that his forces were outnumbered, he burned his camp and both Serb populated Belgrade suburbs on Sava and Danube. He then retreated to Smederevo where he spent two days looting and burning it. Yeğen Osman left Smederevo and went to Niš via Smederevska Palanka. From Niš he wrote to porte reports about the siege and requested military and financial support to defend Belgrade and to annihilate rebellious rayah. He explained that Belgrade will fall if his requests would not be met within ten days. Porte sent him 120 bags of gold and decided to mobilize Muslim population of Rumelia to deal with rebelled population of Belgrade pashalik.  Last years  Yeğen Osman, by then a Pasha, then attempted to become grand vizier. Although Yeğen Osman's ambition angered the other Ottoman statesmen they were reluctant to make an operation against Yeğen Osman for they were afraid of the exaggerated power of Osman. However, in a war council in Edirne, Selim I Giray the Crimean khan and a vassal of the Ottoman Empire called the Ottoman Porte to execute Osman Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim When this happened, the incumbent grand vizier outlawed the sekban corps, threatening soldiers who proved unwilling to disperse with execution, and a civil war ensued. The sekbans gained the upper hand, but a further volte-face of the Ottoman central administration saw Yeğen Osman be captured and executed. This did not end the sekban's rebellions, and while in 1698 the Sultan reached an agreement with the sekbans, extending them guarantees in return for future good behaviour, the agreement was rapidly broken, and sekban's rebellions continued throughout the 18th century.

As they are manifested by convention, semantic rules must first be more widely accepted to become a standard. They correspond with the SUCCESS rule set UNIFY.  IBCS Notation  IBCS Notation is the designation for the semantic rule set suggested by IBCS. IBCS Notation covers the unification of terminology (e.g. words, abbreviations, and number formats), descriptions (e.g. messages, titles, legends, and labels), dimensions (e.g. measures, scenarios, and time periods), analyses (e.g. scenario analyses and time series analyses), and indicators (e.g. highlighting indicators and scaling indicators).

The most popular and famous of the Cape journals from the 1800s, it was founded in 1851 by Professor Roderick Noble (1829-1875), a Professor of Physical Science and English at the South African College from 1859, who originally hailed from Inverness, Scotland. Professor Noble co- edited the Cape Monthly with Alfred Whaley Cole (later a local Judge from 1888 until he was forced to retire due to his deafness). In 1862 Noble retired as editor. Noble was in turn also an editor with The South African Commercial Advertiser from 1864 (at the time owned by his brother John, a clerk of the Cape Parliament from 1865), and with the Cape Argus from 1872. He also returned to editing the Cape Monthly Magazine from 1870 until his death. After Professor Noble's sudden death in 1875, aged only 46, the journal was taken over by his brother John Noble, who then served as editor until 1879.

Hodges. Attorney General Sam Olens said Georgia would \\"adhere to the ruling of the Court\\". The first couple wed just minutes after the ruling was handed down. Previously, Georgia banned same-sex marriage both by statute and by constitutional amendment. Recognition of same-sex unions Same-sex marriage has been recognized in Georgia since June 26, 2015, when the Supreme Court of the United States declared all same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges. All Georgia counties began immediately (or were either willing to) issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. domestic partner benefits either county-wide or in particular cities. Prior to the Obergefell decision, there was no state-level legal recognition of same-sex marriages, such having been prohibited by Georgia Constitutional Amendment 1 in 2004. A few municipal entities, such as Atlanta, maintained a domestic partnerships registry for city employees who were in both same-sex and opposite-sex cohabiting couples. =Federal Lawsuits= Inniss v. Aderhold On April 22, 2014, three same-sex couples and a widow filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on behalf of themselves and all unmarried same-sex Georgia couples and all Georgia residents who have married same-sex spouses in other jurisdictions. They later added another couple. Two of the four couples had married in other states, Connecticut and New Hampshire. The suit, Inniss v. Aderhold, named Deborah Aderhold, State Registrar and Director of Vital Records, as the principal defendant. District Court Judge William S. Duffey Jr. was considering the defendants' motion to dismiss. Defendants argued for an extension to file their briefs because of the volatility of cases around the country. Judge Duffey granted an extension to October 22, 2014. On January 8, 2015, Judge Duffey denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. He found that the plaintiffs were asserting they had a fundamental right to marry a person of the same sex, which is not a right protected by the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Since a fundamental right was not at issue, he explained he would assess Georgia's ban under the least restrictive standard of review, rational basis. He denied the motion because the state defendants had not yet met the rational basis standard by explaining the link between Georgia's ban on same-sex marriage and the state's interest in \\"child welfare and procreation\\". On January 20, 2015, the defendants asked Judge Duffey to suspend proceedings until the U.S. Supreme Court rules in pending same-sex marriage cases, and the plaintiffs supported that request on January 27. On January 29, the court suspended some proceedings, but allowed the parties to appeal his earlier order to the Eleventh Circuit, so that court would have a wider set of arguments to consider along with the Florida case, Brenner v. Scott. Politics The case was the subject of dispute in the 2014 re- election campaign of Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, who was defending the state's position, and his opponent Greg Hecht, who advocated not defending the state's ban on marriage rights for same-sex couples. Olens was re-elected. Public opinion According to the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), in 2015 and 2016, respectively, 45% and 51% of Georgia residents supported same-sex marriage.PRRI: American Values Atlas 2015PRRI: American Values Atlas 2016 Others polls, notably one conducted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2013, have shown that Millennials overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage, while those above 65 are mostly opposed.AJC poll: Support for gay marriage in Georgia is growing In 2017, the PRRI found that 52% of Georgians supported same-sex marriage, while 39% opposed it and 9% didn’t know.PRRI: American Values Atlas 2017 See also *LGBT rights in Georgia (U.S. state) *Same-sex marriage in the United States References Category:2015 in LGBT history Category:LGBT in Georgia (U.S. state) Georgia ","title":"Same-sex marriage in Georgia (U.S. state)"},{"id":"44527316","text":"Acleris fuscotogata is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

He was a Cornell University graduate who became Professor of Botany and was also employed as an associate cytologist for the United States Department of Agriculture. He was also an avid iris collector and wrote a book on the Iris genus. He carried out important research into plant chromosomes of iris, orchid genus and corn plants (such as maize). He was sometimes known as \\"Fitz\\" by his many friends and associates. Education and early life Lowell Fitz Randolph, was born on 7 October 1894 in Alfred, New York. Lowell's family had over 200 years of history of being deeply involved in the Seventh Day Baptist Church community, and that Lowell and his sister Vida were the first to break with that community and strong tradition and follow independent, secular paths pursuing their passion for science. Lowell was educated at local schools in Alfred and graduated from Alfred University in 1916. In 1918, he then went to Cornell University to complete his Ph.D. and work as an assistant in botany under Rollins A. Emerson and Prof. L. W. Sharp. His thesis was on the development of normal and abnormal chloroplasts in maize, which was completed under Prof. Sharp's direction in 1921. He then studied cytology with Lester in the Botany Department and minored in Plant Breeding with Emerson.Jean-Paul Gaudillière and Hans-Jörg Rheinberge (Editors) In 1920, he attend the meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago, and presented a paper to the American Naturalist Division on 'A case of maternal inheritance in Maize: Cytological Relations'. He is a member of the Association and of the Botanical Society of America. In 1907, Herbert J. Webber started the Synapsis Club, a student/faculty organization at Cornell, Prof. Emerson continued the club and encouraged his students to become members, including Randolph. He also became a member of the Gamma Alpha Graduate Scientific Fraternity and of the Cornell Biological Society. In 1921, he obtained his Ph.D. degree, in the Botany department. Career In May 1922, he published 'Cytology of Chlorophyll Types of Maize' in the Botanical Gazette, Vol. 73, No. 5, pp. 337–375.Edmund Vincent Cowdry (Editor)US Dept. of Agriculture Then he started working as Prof. Sharp's teaching assistant in the winter term of 1922. He also was an instructor in botany, until 1923, when Prof. Emerson recommended Randolph to get a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) appointment at Cornell to investigate corn chromosome cytology. He started working as cytologist (cell biologist) with the Office of Cereal Investigations, for the USDA, Several other graduate students, including George Beadle, and Marcus Rhoades, were also supported at Cornell by USDA funds. He was stationed at Cornell (while working for the Office) and so could continued his research work with corn and his association with the University's Department of Botany. In 1924, he started on an Advanced genetics course of Emerson and started to use John Belling's iron-aceto-carmine smear technique to clarify chromosome numbers. In September 1924, Barbara McClintock (a 2nd year graduate), started worked as a research assistant to Randolph, as well as a working as a teaching assistant to Prof. Sharp.Jeff L. Bennetzen and Sarah C. Hake (Editors) They then started to apply the smear technique to pollen cells of corn and hypothesized the origin of polyploidy in Maize. In 1925, they discovered a corn plant had three complete sets of chromosomes (meaning it was a triploid). They also studied the meiotic (cell division) behaviour of the chromosomes in the pollen of the corn. The results of the study were published in 1926.Esra Galun L.F. Randolph and B. McClintock 1926, 'Polyploidy in Zea mays' L. in American Naturalist, Vol.LX (666) Jan-Feb on pages 99–102. McClintock was very upset that her name appeared second in the article, since she thought that she had completed most of the research. Also their study techniques were also very different. Randolph was very careful, cautious and meticulous, where as McClintock liked to try out and modify new techniques. After she altered the Belling technique, Randolph was furious at me, and That was the beginning and end of a friendship she recalled in 1978.Nathaniel C. Comfort Randolph ended their collaboration and McClintock began to work under Prof. Sharp, who gave her more freedom. In 1926, he reported their findings at the 1926 International Botanical Congress at Cornell, and he then published 'A cytological study of two types of variegated pericarp in Maize' in Agr. Expt. Sta. Mem. Vol.102, (page 14). Between 1926 and 1927, he spent a year visiting several laboratories in Europe under a travelling fellowship of the International Education Board. In 1928, he published 'Types of supernumeracy chromosomes in Maize', in Anatomical Record Vol.41 on page 102, and published 'Chromosome Numbers in Zea mays L'.Lowell Fitz Randolph In the early 1930s, 2 technical assistants to Randolph were paid by the USDA, to maintain the stock collecting of the maize fields and assist in hand pollination. He also became interested in the chromosomes and evolution of wild and cultivated iris. He and his students at Cornell, started following up on the work on chromosome studies of garden irises by Marc Simonet at the Genetic Institute at Versailles, France in 1930s.Donald Wyman But he stilled carried on his maize research, and in 1932, he published 'Some effects of high temperature on polyploidy and other variations in Maize', in Genetics Vol.18 on page 222–229.(page656) Then in 1936, he published 'Developmental morphology of the caryopsis in maize' in J. Agric. Res. Vol.53 (pages 881-916). Randolph and his wife Fannie made several trips to Europe collecting irises. They travelled to England (between 1936 and 1939, also in 1950 and 1959), France (in 1950 and 1954), Denmark (in 1950), and Sweden (in 1950). He also led expeditions in search of new forms of iris, including Iris pumila. In 1939, he was appointed Professor of botany at Cornell, a title which he held concurrently until 1947, when he resigned from his position with the federal Department of Agriculture, so that he could concentrate his research on cytogenetics in the Department of Botany. In 1940, he published with D.B. Hand, 'Relation between carotenoid content and number of genes per cell in diploid and tetraploid corn' in J. Agric. Res. Vol.60 (pages 51–64), then Randolph did a comprehensive study of Maize 'B chromosome' inheritance in 1941. In a complaint letter to Marcus Morton Rhoades (Editor of Genetics journal) in 1942, he criticised Barbara McClintock's editing the work of a pupil of Randolph's. Calling her a prima donna, who wants to be the goddess of science and godmother to aspiring young scientists everywhere. After World War II, he began to study corn seed that had been exposed to atomic radiation at Bikini Atoll, in the Pacific Ocean. he then published the results in the Science Journal.Alexander Hollaender (Editor) In 1943, he and L.G. Cox published 'Factors influencing the germination of Iris seed and the relation of inhabiting substances to embryo dormancy' Pro.Am.Soc.Hort.Sci. Vol.43 (page284-300).Jakob Reinert and Yashpal S. Baja (Editors) He was appointed chairman of the Scientific Committee of the American Iris Society, between 1945, and 1946. He started the counting of chromosomes of iris, growing seeds in vitro and classification of the genus. He also published in 1945, 'Embryo culture of Iris seed' Bull.Am.Iris Soc. Vol.97 (page 33-45). He was still president of the Cornell University chapters of Phi Kappa Phi (between 1947–48) and Sigma Xi (between 1953–54). He also collected with Efraim Ildefonso Hernández-Xolocotzi Guzman (1913-1991) in Mexico for the Natural History Museum and Grey Herbarium. Finding and publishing Tripsacum zopilotense Hernandez-Xolocotzi, E. & Randolph, L.F. in 1950, in Guerrero, Mexico. In 1951, C.F. Konzak, Randolph and L.F. Jensen published 'Embryo culture of Barley species hybrids. Cytological studies of Hordeum sativum x Hordeum bulbosum' in J. Heredity Vol.42 (pages125-134).B. M. Johri (Editor) In 1954, he went to Europe and the Middle East on an iris hunting field trip, which included Switzerland, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Germany, Austria, Cypress, Turkey, Lebanon, and Egypt. In 1955, Randolph and his wife (Fannie), published 'Embryo culture of Iris seed', in the 'Bulletin of the American Iris Society' Vol.139 pages 7–17, this was an updated publication that he had earlier published (solo) in 1945.Indra Vasil (Editor) He also published 'Cytogenetic aspects of the origin and evolutionary history of corn' in 'Corn and Corn improvement' (G.F. Sprague Editor) pages 16–57A. Mujeeb-Kazi and L. A. Sitch During 1956 and 1959, he was made Membership Chairman for American Iris Society (AIS). He then spent six months in 1957–58 at Aligarh Muslim University in India with a Fulbright Award, as a consultant on embryo culture. In 1959, he wrote and had published Garden Irises, which has 575 pages.A. K. Singh Within the book, the chapter, 'Chromosomes of Garden varieties of Bearded Iris',(pages315-324) showed his academic interest. He also re-organised the William Dykes classification of irises, by moving certain irises into different sections and subgenra. This classification is still used by the American Iris Society.A. K. Singh He served as the vice president and then became the 9th, President of the American Iris Society from 1960 to 1962. Randolph and his wife, kept an extensive collection of iris in his garden at their home in Ithaca, which attracted many visitors. He was not only interested in irises but also orchids, specifically the genus Dendrobium. In 1960, T. Vajrabhaya and Randolph published 'Chromosome studies in Dendrobium' in Amer. Orchid Soc. Bull. Vol.29 (pages 507-517).Haruyuki Kamemoto, Teresita D. Amore and Adelheid R. Kuehnle In 1961, he published 'Cytotaxonomic studies of Louisiana Irises' in Bot Gazette Vol.123 (pages 125-133) with Jyotirmay Mitra. After nearly 40 years at Cornell, he retired in 1961, but started working part-time during the winters, at the Fairchild Tropical Garden, in Miami, Florida as a research collaborator. Including work on Tripsacum grasses, which he imported from Mexico and Guatemala. He then spent his summers back home at Ithaca. He also started working on the evolutionary history of maize. In 1966, Iris nelsonii was first published and described by Randolph in 'Baileya' (a Quarterly Journal of Horticultural Taxonomy of Ithaca, NY) 14: 150 in 1966. The species was named after Ira S. \\"Ike\\" Nelson, professor of horticulture at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, and one of the founders, and early show managers, of the Society for Louisiana Irises. Nelson collaborated with Randolph, and together they identified Iris nelsonii, and Randolph named it after Nelson. In 1966, Randolph LF and Randolph also published 'Iris species collecting trips abroad' Medianite Vol.7 Issue 4 (pages61-65).Dan H. Meckenstock In 1967, Randolph, I.S. Nelson and R.L. Plaisted published 'Negative evidence of introgression affecting the stability of Louisiana Iris species' Cornell Univ Ag. Exp. Station Mem. Vol.398 (pages 1–56). This paper reviewed the morphological and pollen fertility data collected for Iris fulva, Iris brevicaulis and Iris hexagona and other hybrid iris populations. He concluded that between the Louisiana iris species was localized hybridization.Charles W. Fox and Jason B. Wolf (Editors) In late 1970, he published 'Variation among Tripsacum populations of Mexico and Guatemala' in Brittonia Vol.22 (page 305-337). In 1976, he published 'Contributions of wild relatives of maize to the evolutionary history of domesticated maize: a synthesis of divergent hypotheses in Economic Botany, Vol.30 (pages321-345), which discounted the role of teosinte as an ancestor of maize.Duccio Bonavia Lowell died in Ithaca in 1980. Awards and honours He was award many honours including; * For his work with iris he received the Vaughn Award (named after Leonard H. Vaughan (President of a seed company and former school board president,)for outstanding contributions to horticulture from the American Society for Horticultural Science (1944). * Distinguished Service Medal from the American Iris Society (1951), * Foster Memorial Plaque (named after Sir Michael Foster of the British Iris Society (1955), with N. Leslie Cave. * Citation for distinguished contributions to horticulture from the American Horticultural Society (1962), * Bronze medal from the Internationale Gartenbauaustellung, Hamburg, West Germany (1963), * Gold medal from the American Iris Society in 1970. * The Randolph-Perry Medal, this is the highest award given by the American Iris Society, started in 2000 and is restricted to species hybrid Irises. It was named after Dr Randolph and Amos Perry (1871-1953), (Father-in- law of Frances Perry) and a British nurserymen and iris hybridizer, and the winner of the first ever Dykes Medal, named after William Rickatson Dykes. Personal life He married a fellow Cornell graduate student in Botany, Fannie C. Rane in 1922. She got her MS degree in Botany in 1923. They settled in Ithaca, and brought up three children. Robert Fitz Randolph (later of Manlius), on 20 December 1927, Elizabeth Jane (Randolph) DeMott (later of Herndon, Virginia,) and Rane Fitz Randolph. They also had nine grandchildren. His daughter, Elizabeth Jane DeMott died on 16 March 2009, after her brother Rane had died. Selected publications about Irises * Randolph, L.

He qualified as a pilot in May 1913, becoming the 497th person to be issued an Aviators' Certificate by the Royal Aero Club. He had trained at Brooklands aerodrome, on a Bristol Biplane.\\"The Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom: Official Notices: Aviator's Certificates\\". Flight, 7 June 1913, Vol. V, No. 232. p. 618. Wilson, by then a major, was assigned to the Royal Naval Division upon the outbreak of the First World War, formed from Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel not required at sea. By October 1914, he was in command of a battalion, with a corresponding promotion to temporary lieutenant-colonel. Wilson was killed in action at Cape Helles, Ottoman Turkey, in May 1915.

It was released worldwide on iOS on 21 May 2014, and on Android on 3 July 2014. Gameplay Bounden guides two players to dance using a single phone. The game features a sphere that rotates using the phone's gyroscope. The sphere has markers placed on top, lined up for the players to pick up by aligning them with the crosshair in the center of the screen. This interface shows both players how to rotate the phone together and in sync. Bounden has 8 dances in total: 4 playful, Twister- like dances made by Game Oven, aimed to get two people entangled. The other 4 are graceful, ballet-like choreographies made by the Dutch National Ballet. The game also features tutorial videos with Dutch National Ballet dancers, intended to show players how to move. Development Bounden started as an experiment to make people ‘dance’ together. After various prototypes, Game Oven found a way that was able to make two people, standing opposite of each other, move fluently and synchronously. As designing movements proved to be very difficult, Game Oven called the Dutch National Ballet to help make choreography for the game. Bounden is made in cooperation with the Junior Company of the Dutch National Ballet. The Junior Company is a group of young dancers led by dancer and choreographer Ernst Meisner, who is responsible for most of the choreography in the game. To show the collaboration with the ballet, Game Oven made a series of 'Making of Bounden' videos during the development. Game Oven presented earlier versions of Bounden at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop at the 2014 Game Developers Conference and the Penny Arcade Expo East 2014. Bounden was also selected as part of the Indiecade Showcase at E3 2014 and the European Innovative Games Showcase at GDC Europe 2014. Reception Bounden was released on May 21, 2014, and has received mostly positive comments. Many journalists praised Bounden for tricking players into dancing, bringing players closer together, and resulting in a \\"mess of limbs.\\" Los Angeles Times journalist Todd Martens noted Bounden might lead to \\"more physical contact than is likely appropriate for near- strangers.\\" References External links * Official website * Game Oven official website Category:2014 video games Category:Indie video games Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands Category:Dance video games Category:IOS games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Multiplayer video games ","title":"Bounden"},{"id":"44527612","text":"Bearmans was a small department store located in Leytonstone, London. History Blue plaque erected by Waltham Forest Council on 17 December 2012 at the site of Bearmans Department Store, 829-837 High Road, LeytonstoneIn 1898, Frank Bearman a 27-year-old draper opened a shop on the north side of Leytonstone High Street on the site of a former vicarage. By 1906 the business had purchased a nearby furniture shop, and in 1910 opened an arcade to match the larger department stores in London. Between 1908 and 1921, Frank Bearman jointly owned with J W Holdron, a store owner in Peckham, the Croydon department store Allders. During the Second World War the store survived the Blitz, and in 1957 expanded again by building a store extension in Kirkdale Road, which Bearmans claimed had the first Escalators outside London. In 1956 Frank Bearman died, and with increased competition in the area, in 1956 the Bearman Store started Lord Brummell; a high-end bespoke line to create more business. The company was sold to the London Co-operative Society for £1 million in 1962. The Co-operative continued to run the store until 1982 when they closed the operation. The building was demolished and replaced, and is now home to Matalan. A Blue Plaque has been placed on the outside of the new building reminding people of Bearmans by the Leyton & Leytonstone Historical Society.

Her father was Cambridge-educated and his opinion of farming as “the highest calling” could well have been carried by his daughter as she moved through life. Laudan’s mother was the traditional image of a farmer’s wife and cooked three meals a day for the family and the farm workers, every day of the year. This idyllic picture was noted by Laudan in an interview with The Austin Chronicle in 2013 where she comments “It created drudgery for my mother”. Her mother cooked everything from scratch and despite Laudan not being forced to help her mother cook, or her father with the farm-work, she grew up surrounded by the food processes of farm to fork. A much repeated memory during interviews with Laudan tell of her father experimenting with grinding wheat to make his own flour. He removed the husks and then attempted to grind the grains by pounding with a pestle and mortar, followed by feeding the wheat through a meat grinder and eventually striking it with a hammer on a flagstone floor. However, Laudan was drawn more towards history as a subject, which she attributes to her awareness of \\"living in history\\" while growing up. From finding flints and artefacts from Roman times scattered around the farm to playing in the cloisters of Salisbury Cathedral, Laudan felt connected to the history around her. Consequently, after time spent in Nigeria with the Voluntary Service Overseas at the age of 18, she returned to study Geology at Bristol University. Moving to University College London she attained her Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Science in 1974.  Career  Moving across the Atlantic, Laudan started her academic career teaching history of science and technology, social and economic history and world history. Initially teaching at Carnegie-Mellon, she also taught at the University of Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech and then the University of Hawaii. While living on the Island, Laudan was struck by the interconnected cuisines that created the fusion of local food and subsequently went on to write her first non-academic book The Food of Paradise which was published by the University of Hawaii in 1996. Despite being rejected by several cautious publishers the book was awarded the 1997 Jane Grigson/ Julia Child prize of the International Association of Culinary Professionals. In 1996, Laudan and her husband the philosopher Larry Laudan, both retired from academia and moved to Mexico. However, they both continued to visit America, Argentina and Spain as visiting lecturers. During her time in Mexico, Laudan worked on the ambitious task of writing her next book Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History which was published in 2012. Like her previous book it became an award-winning publication, gaining the IACP Cookbook Award for Best Book in Culinary History.

The show is a spoof of police documentaries such as Road Wars and Police Interceptors. The show first aired on 27 October 2014 on BBC One Scotland. The show aired four series, including specials, on the channel until 2017. As of series 5, which begun on 4 April 2019, the show airs on the new BBC Scotland channel. The show is directed by Iain Davidson and is narrated by Joe Hullait. Former Absolutely star Jack Docherty plays the fictional force's police chief. In November 2016, a special crossover episode made for Children in Need featured several of the show's characters meeting characters from Scottish soap opera River City. Cast and characters *Jack Docherty as Chief Commissioner Cameron Miekelson (pronounced MEE-kel-son). Miekelson is a competent Chief Commissioner, but he can occasionally be out of touch with modern values and technology. He also has a huge ego and an inflated sense of his abilities. In his free time, Miekelson enjoys writing; he has written a series of books about a police officer named Michael Cameronson. He is also regularly seen talking to his secretary, Jean (who is not seen or heard by viewers). *James Allenby-Kirk as Volunteer Officer Ken Beattie. PC Ken Beattie in Series Four. Though he devotes enormous amounts of his personal time to helping people in need of police assistance, Ken is often abused and mistreated by the public. He also has an unfortunate habit of unknowingly assisting drug dealers. *Jordan Young as PC Jack McLaren. Jack is a stereotypical ladies' man, often flirting with women on the job. His extensive physical fitness routines often help him to catch runaway criminals. *Sally Reid as PC Sarah Fletcher. Sarah is Jack's partner. She is usually very cool-headed and reasonable, as opposed to Jack, whose temper often flares up at the slightest provocation. Sarah has been an official face of the unified Scottish Police Force, which makes Jack jealous. *Karen Bartke as Sergeant Karen Anne Millar. \\"Officer Karen\\" is the desk sergeant. She is often found dealing with Bobby, the young man who often comes into her office with queries (which frequently have little to do with police work). *Ashley Smith as PC Jane MacKay. One half of the rural police team (seemingly based in the Trossachs), Jane is getting used to the slower-paced country lifestyle. She seems to be unaware of her partner Charlie's fondness for her, often completely misreading his attempts to tell her how he feels. *Chris Forbes as PC Charlie MacIntosh. Charlie hails from the rural area he polices, and is enthralled by Jane's tales of the city. He also has an unrequited crush on her. Charlie is a huge fan of the musicians Enya and Phil Cunningham, and is a keen accordionist. *Grado as PC Hugh McKirdy. One of the two traffic officers, McKirdy is often prone to tomfoolery on the job, sometimes failing to properly apprehend criminals whose crimes amuse him. *Manjot Sumal as PC Surjit Singh. McKirdy's long-suffering partner is a very no-nonsense by-the-book officer who has no qualms about stepping in and correcting his mistakes. *M.L. Stone as Maggie LeBeau. Maggie takes calls from the public, who often bombard her with ludicrous complaints and tales. *Darren Connell as Bobby Muir. A well-meaning but very dim-witted man who clearly has a crush on Officer Karen and visits her on a regular basis with various questions and complaints. Bobby lives with his Uncle Jeffy and his dog, Fridge. *Julie Wilson Nimmo as DC Megan Squire *Louise McCarthy as DC Andrea McGill. Megan's inexperienced partner. *Stuart MacPherson as Archie Pepper.

However, God was for him the supreme name, and he had devoted himself to Him. Retired in solitude, He went his way blessedly And stepped, so far from storm and waves, Calmly up to the highest heaven! Your mind was so focused on God, That you feel what is right, is good. You feel committed to the Lord, And his law only is your delight. You are the father of your flock, Its salvation is really all your joy, And you do not quiver before the labour Cowardly back like a hireling. You came from far away, To help it in fight and death, When you heard the news That a bad scourge threatened it. You care for the heart of the lovely children, You bring the adults to God, You know to combine seriousness with goodness And alleviate consoling every need. You are shining through your actions And sustain your word by them, And one never saw you drooped, You proceeded even more strongly. Noble knowledge adorns you, too, You are an expert of history, And what archives held enclosed You have often brought to light. So be God on your way, He console you, should you be scared! His grace will always meet you, May he preserve you long for us! }  Setting  The in total 143-bar long work in C major is scored for choir and soloists, and piano. The cantata is in six parts: # Recitative \\"Sankt Jodok sproß\\": bass soloist (bars 1–7) # Aria \\"In Einsamkeit zurückgezogen\\": bass soloist (bars 8–23) # Choir \\"Du bist der Vater\\": mixed choir (bars 27–79) Ziemlich langsam, gemütlich # Aria \\"Du pflegst das Herz\\": soprano soloist (bars 80–102) Langsam, mit Gefühl # Recitative \\"Nicht minder ziert\\": tenor soloist (bars 103–109) # Finale \\"Heil unserm Vater\\": mixed choir (bars 100–143) Mäßig langsam Despite it contains already own ideas of the composer, the 6-part cantata looks somewhat archaic with its two recitatives, arias and choir parts. The arias look back to baroque examples, in which a basso continuo instrument accompany the solo- singer. The choir parts – a little in the follow of Michael Haydn – refer with imitation phrases to florid counterpoint.

It aims to criminalise the intimidation of consenting adults by kangaroo courts for same-gotra marriages, inter-caste, inter- community and inter-religious marriages. Overview The first draft was presented by the Law Commission of India on 20 January 2012. The commission had also released a consultation paper on khap panchayats and honour killings, and sought public opinion on it. The commission’s consultation paper had rejected the government’s proposal that Indian Penal Code should be amended to bring honour killing under Section 300. The commission said that although the offences were already covered by the Indian Penal Code, there was nothing to prevent such assemblies from happening. The proposed bill seeks to prohibit any person or group of persons to gather and adjudicate or condemn any marriage, which is not prohibited by law, on the claims that it brings dishonour of a caste, locality or community. Marriage, as defined by the draft, also includes proposed and intended marriages. The district collector and magistrate will be given the responsibility to protect the targeted persons and prevents such illegal gatherings. Criminal intimidation will have the same definition as under the Section 503 of the Indian Penal Code. The offences under it will be cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable. The trials will be decided by a sessions judge or an additional session judge. Special courts which would be set by states in consultation with the High Courts will have the power of a session court.

A passenger service was run, but bus competition overwhelmed it after 1920 and the passenger service closed in 1935. The goods and mineral traffic continued, but it was dependent on the industries it served, and when they declined so did the business on the railway; it closed in 1964 and none of it is now in railway use. History =Before the Kilsyth and Bonnybridge Railway= Kilsyth and Bonnybridge had both become important industrial centres during the nineteenth century; the proximity of the Forth and Clyde Canal as a transport medium facilitated the development of industry, and coal mining and iron smelting had become particularly dominant. The Baird Brothers of Gartsherrie were especially prominent in Kilsyth, and they built a considerable network of mineral tramways serving their pits and ironworks. Although the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had opened in 1842, its route lay some distance to the south, and across the Forth and Clyde Canal.The E&GR; main line had a \\"Bonnybridge\\" station, but this was some considerable distance from the town. The first town in the district reached by a railway was Denny, served from the east in 1858: the Scottish Central Railway opened its branch to the town, from Larbert Junction. In 1878 the nominally independent Kelvin Valley Railway was opened, running from Kilsyth to a junction with the Campsie Branch of the North British Railway, successor to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and giving access for passengers and minerals to Glasgow over that company's lines. The following year a second section of the Kelvin Valley line was opened, running to Maryhill on the north-west margin of Glasgow, and giving access there over the Stobcross branch of the North British Railway to the new dock at Stobcross, soon to be named the Queen's Dock.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, =Authorisation= System map of the Kilsyth and Bonnybridge RailwayThe industrial potential of the tract of land between Kilsyth and Denny was attractive for exploitation. At this period there was intense rivalry between the North British Railway and the Caledonian Railway, and any proposed construction into the competitor's territory might result in hostile and costly reprisals. At length an independent concern was promoted to build a line closing the gap. The Kilsyth and Bonnybridge Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament on 10 August 1882, with capital of £130,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The line was to run from the Kelvin Valley Railway at Kilsyth to Bonnywater Junction on the Caledonian's Denny branch.H C Casserley, Britain's Joint Lines, Ian Allan Ltd, Shepperton, 1968, Evidently the proprietors had second thoughts, for in 1885 they decided to abandon the project. However they again changed their mind and continued with the construction.Glasgow Herald newspaper, 5 February 1885, cited in Ross, NBRDavid Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Although the terrain was relatively easy, the line was not constructed speedily, and in fact the Caledonian Railway built a short branch line to Bonnybridge in the meantime, opening in 1886. However the Caledonian's Bonnybridge terminus was on the south side of the Forth and Clyde Canal, limiting its usefulness. On 12 July 1887 the K&BR; obtained a further Act authorising either the NBR or the Caledonian Railway to work the line. =Operation= The Kilsyth and Bonnybridge line opened on 2 July 1888.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, Immediately prior to the opening the Company agreed with the NBR and the Caledonian to operate the railway as a \\"common line\\" with both those companies permitted to operate trains over it; the NBR had running powers to Larbert over the Caledonian Railway. Station staffing was at the expense of the K&BR; itself. Infrastructure maintenance was carried out by each company in alternate years. Site of Banknock Railway StationFollowing the opening of the line there were normally four passenger trains daily between Glasgow and Bonnybridge. The Caledonian operated onwards trains from Bonnybridge to Larbert. Ross says, in The Caledonian, page 130, that the Caledonian Railway connections were to Greenhill. This is a mistake; the Greenhill trains were from the Caledonian Railway Bonnybridge station, south of the Forth and Clyde Canal. Some NBR trains ran throughout between Glasgow and Larbert via Bonnybridge.Gordon Stansfield, Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2002, The Caledonian also owned the Forth and Clyde Canal at this time. The canal ran parallel to the railway, and the Caledonian went to considerable lengths to arrange mineral line connections to the canal, to facilitate its use by mining companies, providing stiff competition for the railway The Company planned an ambitious scheme to construct a three-mile tunnel under the Forth to Dunfermline, but the first half-year profits of £297, enabling a dividend of 0.375%, illustrated how impossible such a scheme would be. In despair the directors prepared to abandon the line,According to Thomas; this may be confusion with the 1885 proposed abandonment of construction. and obtained Parliamentary powers to do so, but business picked up a little and they did not proceed with the closure. Bridge over the Garrel Glen now utilised as part of the north Kilsyth path network In 1908 the independent staffing of the stations ceased and the railway was staffed by the NBR and the Caledonian, working together. Following the Railways Act 1921, the K&BR; ended its independent existence and the line became jointly operated between the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), as successor to the North British Railway, and the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) as successor to the Caledonian Railway. Motor bus services and improved roads encouraged the development of efficient bus services in the 1920s and use of the passenger trains declined steeply. Passenger services were withdrawn on 1 July 1935. As the mines closed freight traffic also declined and the line was closed in stages. The last section to close was between Kilsyth and Banknock, on 4 May 1964. Topography The line opened on 2 July 1888 and closed to passenger trains on 1 February 1935. Locations on the line were: * Kilsyth; Kelvin Valley Railway station; may have been renamed Kilsyth Old after opening of K&BR; line; closed 6 August 1951 (serving the Glasgow direction); * Kilsyth New; may have been known as Kilsyth Junction; * Colzium; closed 1 March 1917; Caledonian trains ceased on 1 February 1917; * Banknock; * Dennyloanhead; * Bonnybridge Central; there was a Caledonian Railway terminus station named Bonnybridge, and a North British Railway station named Bonnybridge High on the former E&GR; main line; * Dennyloanhead Junction; converged with Caledonian Railway branch from Denny.

The central burial chamber is equipped with a capstone weighing , surrounded by 23 slabs taller than a man, forming a circle. The Poskær Dolmen, as seen in this picture from 1937 (person beside it for scale) The capstone is the lesser half of a granite slab brought to Denmark from Northern Scandinavia by ice age glaciers' movements. The underside is remarkably flat, and possibly split from another half, by the dolmen builders. The other half is a slab to the northwest, placed as a capstone on another dolmen, Agri Dyssen. How these slabs were transported and erected by Stone Age people is not known. Apart from Denmark's easternmost island, Bornholm, the country has no bedrock.

The greatest advantage of cycloisomerization reactions is its atom economical nature, by design nothing is wasted, as every atom in the starting material is present in the product. In most cases these reactions are mediated by a transition metal catalyst, in few cases organocatalysts and rarely do they occur under thermal conditions. These cyclizations are able to be performed with excellent levels of selectivity in numerous cases and have transformed cycloisomerization into a powerful tool for unique and complex molecular construction.For a review on cycloisomerization reactions see: Enantioselective, transition metal catalyzed cycloisomerizations Angela Marinetti, Hélène Jullien and Arnaud Voituriez Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012,41, 4884-4908 , Critical Review . Cycloisomerization is a very broad topic in organic synthesis and many reactions that would be categorized as such exist. Two basic classes of these reactions are intramolecular Michael addition and Intramolecular Diels–Alder reactions. Under the umbrella of cycloisomerization, enyne and related olefin cycloisomerizations are the most widely used and studied reactions.Watson, I. D. G.; Toste, F. D. Chem. Sci. 2012, 3, 2899–2919. Intramolecular Michael addition A rather intuitive route to cyclic isomers is the intramolecular conjugate addition to α,β–unsaturated carbonyls (intramolecular Michael addition or IMA). Competent Michael acceptors include conjugated enones, enals or nitroalkene derivatives and examples of other acceptors are sparse.Nodes, W. J.; Nutt, D. R.; Chippindale, A. M.; Cobb, A. J. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 16016–16017. Despite IMA reactions being ubiquitous in synthesis, very few examples of asymmetric IMA transformations exist. Thiourea catalysts with pendant chiral backbones have shown to activate systems with tethered nitroalkane and ester motifs to induce asymmetric IMA.For a review on thiourea catalysis see: Zhang, Z.; Schreiner, P. R. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009, 38, 1187–1198. The utility of this transformation was demonstrated in the synthesis of cyclic γ– amino acid precursors (figure 1). It is proposed that activation occurs via H–bonding of both the nitronate and the ester to the thiourea catalyst and explains the interesting selectivity for the E–ester. center A functional stereodivergent organocatalyzed IMA/lactonization transformation in the synthesis of substituted dihydrofurans and tetrahydrofurans has been studied for its ability to construct important structural motifs in numerous natural products (figure 2).Belmessieri, D.; Houpliere, A.; Calder, E. D. D.; Taylor, J. E.; Smith, A. D. Chem. Eur. J. 2014, 20, 9762–9769. When ethers such as 3 are subject to (S)–(–)–tetramisole hydrochloride (4) catalyst the result is the syn–2,3–substituted THF while the complementary anti–product is easily accessible via a Cinchona alkaloid catalyst such as 7. center Intramolecular Diels–Alder Intramolecular Diels–Alder (IMDA) reactions pair tethered dienes and dienophiles in a [4+2] fashion, the most common being terminal substitution. These transformations are popular in total synthesis and have seen a wide spread use in advance to numerous difficult synthetic targets.Takao, K; Munakata, R.; Tadano, K. Chem. Rev. 2005, 105, 4779–4807. One such use is the application of an enantioselective IMDA transformation in the asymmetric synthesis of the marine toxin (–)–isopulo’upone (10).Johnson, J. S.; Evan, D. A. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 786–787. center The synthesis of (–)– isopulo’upone demonstrated the utility of cationic Cu(II)bis(oxazoline) complex catalyzed IMDA reactions to give bicyclic products with as many as four neighboring stereogenic centers (figure 3). A rather recent application of IMDA reactions in complex molecule synthesis is the IMDA approach to the tricyclic core of palhinine lycopodium alkaloids, a class of natural products isolated from nodding club moss.Sizemore, N.; Rychnovsky, S. D. Org. Lett. 2014, 16, 688–691. N–heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are an emerging class of organocatalysts that are able to induce Umpolung reactivity as well as normal polarity transformations, however until recently these have not been broadly used in total synthesis due to limited substrate scope.Izquierdo, J. Hutson, G. E.; Cohen, D. T.; Scheidt, K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 11686–11698. An interesting expansion in the use of these organocatalysts is the NHC catalyzed olefin isomerization/IMDA cascade reaction to give unique bicyclic scaffolds.For a review on N–heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis cascade reactions, see: Grossman, A.; Enders, D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 314–325.Kowalczyk, M.; Lupton, D. W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 5314–5317. Dienyl esters such as 11 were transformed into substituted bicyclo[2.2.2]octanes via an isomerization step stabilized by a hemiacetal azolium intermediate (13). The activation barrier of isomerization of 1,3–hexadiene through a [1,5]–shift is 41 Kcal mol–1 and is expected to increase with conjugation to the ester, thus uncatalyzed isomerization is unlikely. This provides the advantage of bypassing a high barrier of activation, providing access to previously unobtainable IMDA derivatives. center Enyne cycloisomerization Enyne cycloisomerization, an alkyne variant of the Alder-ene reaction (figure 5), is an intramolecular rearrangement of 1,n–enynes to give the corresponding cyclic isomer. center Although the rearrangement may occur under thermal conditions, the scope of the thermal rearrangement is limited due to the requirement of high temperatures, thus transition metals such as Au, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir are often employed as catalysts. As synthesis quarrels to build complex structural motifs in the presence of inductive, stereoelectronic and steric demands this rearrangement has recently been developed as a robust method for constructing carbo– and heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent chemo–, regio– and diastereoselective outcomes. There is not a single mechanism that can be used to describe enyne cycloisomerizations as the mechanism depends on reaction conditions and catalyst selection.Genêt, J. –P.; Toullec, P. Y.; Michelet, V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2008, 47, 4268–4315. Intermediates of the metal catalyzed cycloisomerization in which the metal coordinates the alkyne or alkene activating either or both are possible and are shown in figure 6. center Activation of the alkyne by complexation with the metal leading to an η2–metal intermediate such as 18 opens up the alkyne to nucleophilic attack and engenders carbocation intermediates. This Pull–push reactivity is important for understanding reactions mediated by π–acids. Complexation of the alkyne to the metal fragment depletes electron density in the bond (‘pull’), in concert with the ability of the metal to back donate (“push”) arouses the observed consecutive electrophilic and nucleophilic character to the vicinal carbon atoms of the alkyne (figure 7). center Metallacycle intermediates (19) are the result of the simultaneous complexation and activation of both partners. Hydrometallation of the alkyne giving a vinyl metal species that may in turn carbometalate the olefin is also possible (20). An example of a 1,6–enyne cycloisomerization proceeding through an η2–activated metal intermediate is given in figure 8,Newcomb, E. T.; Ferreira, E. M. Org. Lett. 2013, 15, 1772–1775. which is common for enyne cycloisomerizations mediated by Pt or Au due to their π–acidic nature. Notably, in this example chirality transfer takes place in which the absolute stereochemistry of the enyne (26) controls stereochemistry of the product (27). center Au and Pt mediated enyne cycloisomerization Alkyne activation with π–acidic metals such as Au or Pt is a conventional method in complex organic manifold synthesis, however how this activation exacts reactivity is not fully understood and thus mechanism is largely proposed on the basis of reaction outcome and theoretical calculations.Fürstner, A.; Davies, P. W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 3410–3449.For a review on gold catalyzed enyne cycloisomerization reactions, see: Jiménez–Núñez, E.; Echavarren, A. M. Chem. Rev. 2008, 108, 3326–3350. Cationic Au(I) and Pt(II) catalyst are attractive choices as they display strong Lewis acid character and the ability to stabilize cationic intermediates while being bench stable.Gorin, D. J.; Toste, F. D. Nature 2007, 446, 395–403. A versatile function of Au(I) catalyzed enyne cycloisomerization is the construction of asymmetric medium–sized rings, which is a challenge in the synthesis of ornamented molecular design. Convenient access to asymmetric 7– and 8–membered carbocycles is possible using chiral BINAP Au(I) gold catalyst, giving a wide variety of products.Watson, I. D. G.; Ritter, S; Toste, F. D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 2056–2057. center It is proposed that intramolecular cyclopropanation occurs via a 1,2–shift of the propargyl ester mediated by Au to give a syn–Au vinyl carbenoid species (29). Computational studies show that the syn–intermediate, 29, is formed under kinetic control and it is suggested that it is in equilibrium with the thermodynamically favorable cis–intermediate which may be intercepted by a nucleophile leading to vinyl cyclopropane diene products, however this is beyond the scope of this article. Vinylcycloalkenes is another functional class of products accessible through alkyne activation of enynes with π–acidic metals. PtCl2 has been shown to catalyze the formation of a variety of exotic vinylcycloalkenes from readily accessible starting materials (figure 10).Fürstner, A.; Stelzer, F.; Szillat, H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 11863–11869. center Notably, a ring expansion is observed for enynes with cyclic alkene motifs. This is rationalized by a formal insertion of the methylene group of the olefin between the two carbons of the alkyne; a mechanistic reasoning for this ring expansion has also been proposed.Zhang, L.; Sun, J.; Kozmin, S. A. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2006, 348, 2271–2296. The formation of these vinycloalkenes in concert with its ability to undergo a ring expansion was exploited to construct intermediate 36 en route to streptorubin B. A similar transformation is possible using cationic Au(I) complexes, however here one can select for vinycycloalkene products through a mechanism proceeding via an initial 5–exo–dig or bicyclepropanes can be produced via an initial 6–endo–dig.Nieto–Oberhuber, C.; Muñoz, M. P.; Buñel, E.; Nevado, C.; Cμrdenas, D. J.; Echavarren, A. M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004, 43, 2402–2406. It is suggested through DFT calculations that the 5–exo–dig cyclization is favored for Au(I) complexes as it has a lower activation barrier relative to the 6–endo–dig and indeed numerous examples of vinylcycloalkenes products produced via an initial 5–exo–dig are given (figure 11). center The reactivity can be reversed by careful selection of reaction conditions, catalyst selection and substrate. The divergent reactivity of these transition metal catalyzed cyclosiomerizations further demonstrates their synthetic utility in building unique molecular skeletons.

He is the son of the sixth president of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa and currently serves as the Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. He was a Lieutenant Commander in the Sri Lanka Navy and had been an aide-de-camp to the President. He is one of the owners of Carlton Sports Network one of the several organizations such as Carlton Pre school and Carlton rugby named after the Carlton House of the Rajapaksa. and was a former captain of the Sri Lanka national rugby union team and the Navy SC rugby team.. He currently plays for the CH & FC in the Dialog Rugby League. His usual position is Flanker, but can also switch to Number 8. On January 30, 2016, Yoshitha Rajapaksa and several senior executives of the Carlton Sports Network Channel were remanded by the Kaduwela Magistrate on charges of financial crimes including alleged charges on money laundering. Early life and family He is the second son of Mahinda Rajapaksa and Shiranthi Rajapaksa. He has two brothers – Namal and Rohitha. His paternal grandfather D. A. Rajapaksa was a Member of Parliament and Minister of Agriculture and Land in Wijeyananda Dahanayake's government. His maternal grandfather, E. P. Wickramasinghe was a retired commodore in the Sri Lanka Navy. Rajapaksa was educated at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. Naval career =Training= In 2006, he joined the Sri Lanka Navy as a cadet officer and received his basic training at the Naval and Maritime Academy where he was promoted to Midshipmen and appointed aide-de-camp to his father the President. Soon thereafter he proceed to Britannia Royal Naval College for his officer training and underwent training on board during her deployment to the Caribbean and with the Fast Attack Flotilla. In 2009, he was commissioned as an Acting Sub Lieutenant in Executive Branch of the Sri Lanka Navy.President attends the passing out parade of Britannia Royal Naval College =Decommission= In January 2015, he was decommissioned from then rank of lieutenant by his father President Mahinda Rajapaksa, soon after the latter's defeat at the 2015 Sri Lankan presidential election discharging him from the navy.Ranil works out peaceful pre-dawn transition of power with Mahinda =Suspension and investigation= Following the 2015 presidential election the Defence Secretary of Sri Lanka sent a letter to the Navy Commander directing a probe on how Yoshitha joined the Navy, how he received overseas scholarships and his alleged engagement in active politics and other activities while being a naval officer. Navy Spokesperson Commander Kosala Warnakulasuriya announced that the Navy has received a letter about Yoshitha from the Defence Secretary and that a probe will be launched into the issues being raised. Yoshitha's resignation letter has not been approved by the Navy Commander and he is serving at the Sri Lanka Navy headquarters. Investigations by a Parliamentary Committee revealed in January 2016 that Yoshitha lacked the qualifications needed for enrollment in the navy, failing to get the minimum results after sitting twice for ordinary level exams. It was further revealed that the state spent over Rs.22.23 million for his training in the United Kingdom and Ukraine. =Reinstatement and resignation= Rajapaksa was reinstated on 25 September 2019, with effect from 28 February 2016 by the Navy Commander on orders of President Maithripala Sirisena to the rank of Lieutenant which he held in 2015. He was subsequently promoted to the temporary rank of Lieutenant Commander and appointed as an ADC to a flag officer on 2 October 2019, two days before his wedding that was held per naval traditions on 4 October 2019 in Colombo. He resigned from the navy on 10 October 2020 and took up appointment as Prime Minister's Chief of Staff having worked with his father during his suspension. During his naval career, he had gained a masters degree and PhD from the National Defense University of Ukraine. =Decorations= His awards include the campaign medals Eastern Humanitarian Operations Medal, North and East Operations Medal, Purna Bhumi Padakkama, Fast Attack Craft (FAC) Squadron Pin and the Commendation Badge. Sports career =Rugby= In 2005 he made the S. Thomas' College's first XV rugby team and in his final year (2006) he captained the team. In 2009 he was appointed captain of the Navy Sports Club Rugby team (a position that he currently retains) and in 2012 Rajapaska went on to captain the Sri Lanka national rugby union team, who were the runners-up in the 2012 Asian Five Nations Division 1 tournament in the Philippines. The national team, under Rajapaska's captaincy, were then successful in winning the 2013 Asian Five Nations Division 1 competition, which qualified them to compete in the 2014 HSBC Asian Five Nations tournament in Japan (the winner of which automatically qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup). Unfortunately Rajapaksa was injured and unable to compete in the 2014 HSBC Asian Five Nations. Rajapaska was also a member of the national rugby sevens team, leading the team which won the Bowl at the 2011 Bourneo Sevens, and competing at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland. In March 2014 Rajapaska was appointed as the head coach of the Ananda College rugby team. Yoshitha Rajapaksa and his brother Rohitha Rajapaksa lost their captaincy of the Navy rugby team and the Army rugby team respectively after they were under probe for using assets under their fathers presidency. They were asked by authorities not to attend practices until further notice. =Shooting= In 2012 he won the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) President's Medal for the Standard Division at the National Handgun Championship – 2012 conducted by the National Rifle Association of Sri Lanka Controversies =Murder Allegations= On May 16, 2012 Wasim Thajudeen, a Sri Lankan rugby player, died in a suspicious car accident in Colombo. It was initially reported that his car hit a wall on the road setting the car on fire and Thajudeen perished inside the car. After the defeat of President Mahinda Rajapaksa on January 8, 2015, Sri Lankan authorities reopened the case due to new evidence, and currently investigating it as a murder. Several news outlets have alleged that Yoshitha Rajapaksa is the mastermind behind the murder because of rivalry and jealousy over a former girlfriend. However, the former president Rajapaksa denied murder allegations against his son, claiming that the investigation is politically motivated. =Financial irregularities at the CSN= He was arrested under Section 32 of the Penal Code and was remanded in January 2016 by Kaduwela Magistrate Dhammika Hemapala over the alleged financial irregularities at the CSN, where he was unable to prove the funds use to run the TV station and misuse of public funds.http://www.dailymirror.lk/104749/yoshitha-rajapaksa-remanded Yoshitha is accused of money laundering to the tune of Rs. 365 million, criminal breach of trust, forgery and undervaluing imported items obtained by CSN. FCID detectives said that they had seized Rs. 165 million from the CSN bank account which not been accounted and the alleged funds for setting up the television channel are believed to be from illegal foreign sources. Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister In October 2020, Rajapaksa was appointed Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, his father Mahinda Rajapaksa. The post was previously held by Sagala Ratnayaka, a Cabinet Minister and member of parliament. The Prime Minister's Office had clarified that the Rajapaksa's position is similar to that of an Additional Secretary.

The group took its name from the Zawiya Mountain in the Idlib Governorate. History In September 2012, Hassan Haj Ali, a defected Syrian Army captain, formed the Hawks of Mount Zawiya Brigade as a subunit of the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades. In early 2014 the Hawks of Mount Zawiya Brigade joined the Syria Revolutionaries Front but later left the SRF due to internal disputes. It was one of the founding members of the 5th Corps but it also became defunct. Since 2014 the group is supplied with BGM-71 TOW missiles from the CIA through Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey, and is one of the original and most prolific users of the missiles in Syria. At the beginning of the Russian military intervention in Syria in October 2015, the headquarters of the Mountain Hawks Brigade was hit by 20 air-to-surface missiles from the Russian Air Force. 2 months later, The Mountain Hawks Brigade clashed with the newly founded Syrian Democratic Forces in the northern Aleppo Governorate, capturing a village from the Army of Revolutionaries. Mountain Hawks Brigade fighters then took down and burned the flags of the SDF and the Army of Revolutionaries while chanting \\"Allahu Akbar\\". The group also participated along with other Fatah Halab factions in the shelling of the Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood in Aleppo. During the Northern Aleppo offensive (February 2016), a unit of the Mountain Hawks Brigade consisting of 50 fighters stationed in the town of Deir Jamal in northern Aleppo defected to the Army of Revolutionaries. The unit's commander was captured by another rebel group soon after his defection. In September 2016, the Mountain Hawks Brigade, along with the Northern Division and the 13th Division, formed the Free Idlib Army, In response to the establishment of the Free Idlib Army, a group of Mountain Hawks Brigade fighters defected to join Jabhat Fatah al-Sham in early October.US-backed rebels defect to al-Qaeda branch in Syria Al Masdar News, 5 October 2016 On 25 January 2017, the groups of fighters which left the Mountain Hawks Brigade in September 2016 for the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, returned, along with their leader, Lt.

Polish forces of the 108th Uhlan Regiment (part of Ostrołęka Group under General Bolesław Roja), supported by the 1st Maritime Rifle Regiment (Captain A. Wasowicz) clashed with Red Armys 18th Rifle Division. The battle ended in Soviet victory. On July 4, 1920, Soviet Western Front, commanded by General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, began its offensive. Polish Army tried to halt the enemy on the line of the Niemen river, but failed to do so, and prepared another defensive line, along the Narew and the Bug river. By late July 1920, Soviet 4th Army, together with III Cavalry Corps (\\"Kavkor\\") of Hayk Bzhishkyan advanced south of the border with East Prussia, towards Osowiec, Łomża and Ostrołęka. The Soviets were opposed by 4 000 Polish soldiers of the Narew/Ostrołęka Group. On August 2, the Soviets attacked Łomża, capturing it in the evening of the same day. A day before, Soviet 10th Cavalry division attacked Nowogród, defended by Polish 108th Uhlan Regiment. The battle resulted in Soviet victory, and the capture of Nowogród was of immense strategic importance, as the cavalry of Hayk Bzhishkyan crossed the Narew, and threatened the rear of Polish 1st Army, which was fighting near Zambrów. Near Sniadowo, Soviet cavalry and riflemen clashed with 4th Battalion of 4th Pomeranian Regiment. Out of 500 Polish soldiers, only 170 survived the battle: the survivors were sent to Modlin to rest. Under the circumstances, General Roja decided to send to Łomża the group of Major Bleszynski, but its counterattack failed, and Bleszynski had to retreat to Ostrołęka. On August 4, the Soviets captured Kolno, and shelled Ostrołęka. The town was defended by 1st Battalion of the 1st Maritime Rifle Regiment. Its commandant, Captain Wasowicz, tried to halt the invaders before Ostrołęka, hoping to gain enough time for the 4th Pomeranian Infantry Regiment to come to his aid. Due to Soviet numerical superiority, Polish units defending Ostrołęka had to abandon the town in the night of August 6/7, when they marched to Różan. Altogether, sailors of the Maritime Rifle Regiment lost 53 KIA. All were buried at the parish cemetery at Rzekuń, next to the bodies of 18 uhlans, killed near Zabiel. In 1928, two monuments, one dedicated to the sailors, another to the uhlans, were unveiled. Despite Polish defeat, the Battle of Ostrołęka was of significant strategic importance, as it slowed Soviet advance westwards for ten days. As a result, Polish Army Headquarters had enough time to regroup the forces, and prepare the Wieprz river counterattack (see Battle of Kock (1920)). The Battle of Ostrołęka is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"OSTROLEKA 5 VIII 1920\\".  See also  * Battle of Warsaw (1920)  Sources  * J.

He is remembered for writing a digest of The Negro Law of South Carolina.  Biography and legal career  O'Neall graduated from South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) in December 1812 and began teaching at Newberry Academy. He was admitted to practice law in May 1814 in South Carolina. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1816 from the Newberry, South Carolina area. He was elected again in 1822, and in 1824, he served as the Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives. He was first elected as a trial judge in 1828, and in 1830 was elected a judge on the South Carolina Court of Appeals. Following reforms to South Carolina's judicial branch, he was elected to serve as Chief Justice and President of the South Carolina Court of Appeals, the highest court of the state. In 1848 O'Neall (who was reported by a personal acquaintance to have owned \\"about 150\\" slaves and to have been \\"a most humane master\\") wrote a digest of the negro law of South Carolina, which he read to the State Agricultural Society. The Society directed him to submit the document to the governor, with a request that he would lay it before the legislature, at its approaching session in November 1848. His book was extremely controversial due to what was perceived by many slaveholding South Carolinians of the time to be its abolitionist-influenced advocacy of sharply reducing the number of crimes for which slaves could be put to death under South Carolina laws. The Columbia, S.C. \\"Telegraph\\" newspaper reported that the Judiciary Committee of the South Carolina state legislature declared \\"The Negro Law in South Carolina\\" to be \\"an objectionable book\\"; and the Telegraph's editors appear to have not only denounced the book for promoting \\"amalgamation\\" of the races but also to have joined calls for the book to be withdrawn from circulation. O'Neall died on December 27, 1863, and is buried in Rosemont Cemetery in Newberry, South Carolina.

Units of the Polish I Corps in Russia, commanded by General Jozef Dowbor-Musnicki, fought with the Red Army over the control of the city of Babruysk (Polish: Bobrujsk), located in eastern Belarus. On July 24, 1917, Jozef Dowbor- Musnicki, who was a General of the Imperial Russian Army and an ethnic Pole, created a Polish tactical-operational unit of the Russian Army: one of the first such units during World War One. After the October Revolution of 1917, headquarters of the Polish I Corps in Russia decided to operate in Belarus, in the area marked by the towns of Rahachow – Zlobin – Babruysk. In January 1918, the First Polish Corps, with its 30 000 soldiers, clashed for the first time with the Red Army, which pushed westwards. Polish troops captured Rahachow, but General Musnicki's target was the Babruysk with its fortress. As Musnicki stated, its capture would enable his soldiers to regroup and organize an effective defence. The siege of Babruysk began on February 2: the town and the fortress were defended by some 7000 Bolshevik soldiers, who capitulated on the next day, February 3. Poles captured large warehouses with food and ammunition. The Soviets decided to recapture the town, and initiated several assaults, all of which failed. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Soviet Russia handed Babruysk over to the Imperial German Army.

It is located at 5 Turner Street in a small wood frame building designed by John Calvin Stevens and built in 1901. It was a gift to the town from Buckfield native John Davis Long in honor of his father Zadoc, and was the town's first library. The library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The library is a single-storey wood frame structure, with a hip roof, walls sheathed in wood shingles, and a granite foundation. A slightly-projecting gable hangs over the entrance, which is centered the three-bay main facade. The doorway is flanked by sidelight windows with diamond panes, echoing a feature in the elliptical hood which surmounts the door. The gable is supported by a pair of console brackets. To the left of the entry are paired sash windows with multi-pane upper and two- pane lower; to the right there are three such windows. The interior of the library is divided into three spaces: the center has the circulation desk, the right side has a reading area, and the left side has the stacks. The stacks consist of original wooden shelving with Craftsman style pedestals at the ends. The reading room has a large brick fireplace. John Davis Long (1838–1915), a Buckfield native, served as Governor of Massachusetts in the 1880s and as United States Secretary of the Navy under President William McKinley. In 1900, he acted on an idea he had harbored for some time to provide his place of birth with a library, hiring the noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens to design the building. The property on which it stands was donated to the town, and the building was completed in 1901. Long and his relatives provided an initial collection of books. The library is one of a series designed by Stevens for a number of small Maine communities around the turn of the 20th century; the design of the Long library was influential in his work on the Rumford Public Library, and the Cary Library in Houlton, both designed in 1903.

Members have also pursued interests outside of the core curriculum in to staff weapons, longsword and small sword. Curriculum Students follow the theories and methods of the Italian and French schools of fencing as laid down by martial arts manuals of fencing instructors such as Achille Marozzo, Salvator Fabris, Giovanni dall’Agocchie and François Dancie. Though sidesword and rapier are considered as different sword forms for teaching purposes, emphasis is placed on the similarities in mechanics and theory. Lessons are instructor led with sparring elements. Members are encouraged to enter competitions and have attended events such as Longpoint, Swordfish, The Albion Cup, The Wessex League and others. History The Renaissance Sword Club was founded in 2013 by Rob Runacres, formerly an instructor at the School of the Sword . Educational Provision Members of the club lecture and provide workshops across Europe. Much of this has centred on the research on sword fighting in Early Modern France.

They deal with the relationship between maximum flow rate (\\"max- flow\\") and minimum cut (\\"min-cut\\") in a multi-commodity flow problem. The theorems have enabled the development of approximation algorithms for use in graph partition and related problems. Multicommodity flow problem A \\"commodity\\" in a network flow problem is a pair of source and sink nodes. In a multi-commodity flow problem, there are commodities, each with its own source s_{i}, sink t_{i}, and demand D_{i}. The objective is to simultaneously route D_{\\\\text{i}} units of commodity from s_{i} to t_{i} for each , such that the total amount of all commodities passing through any edge is no greater than its capacity. (In the case of undirected edges, the sum of the flows in both directions cannot exceed the capacity of the edge). Specially, a 1-commodity (or single commodity) flow problem is also known as a maximum flow problem. According to the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm, the max-flow and min-cut are always equal in a 1-commodity flow problem. =Max-flow and min-cut= In a multicommodity flow problem, max-flow is the maximum value of , where is the common fraction of each commodity that is routed, such that fD_{\\\\text{i}} units of commodity can be simultaneously routed for each without violating any capacity constraints. min-cut is the minimum of all cuts of the ratio \\\\varphi of the capacity of the cut to the demand of the cut. Max-flow is always upper bounded by the min-cut for a multicommodity flow problem. =Uniform multicommodity flow problem= In a uniform multicommodity flow problem, there is a commodity for every pair of nodes and the demand for every commodity is the same. (Without loss of generality, the demand for every commodity is set to one.) The underlying network and capacities are arbitrary. =Product multicommodity flow problem= In a product multicommodity flow problem, there is a nonnegative weight for each node v \\\\in V in graph G=(V,E). The demand for the commodity between nodes and is the product of the weights of node and node . The uniform multicommodity flow problem is a special case of the product multicommodity flow problem for which the weight is set to 1 for all nodes u \\\\in V. =Duality of linear programming= In general, the dual of a multicommodity flow problem for a graph is the problem of apportioning a fixed amount of weight (where weights can be considered as distances) to the edges of such that to maximize the cumulative distance between the source and sink pairs. =History= The research on the relationship between the max-flow and min-cut of multicommodity flow problem has obtained great interest since Ford and Fulkerson's result for 1-commodity flow problems. Hu showed that the max- flow and min-cut are always equal for two commodities. Okamura and Seymour illustrated a 4-commodity flow problem with max-flow equals to 3/4 and min-cut equals 1. Shahrokhi and Matula also proved that the max-flow and min-cut are equal provided the dual of the flow problem satisfies a certain cut condition in a uniform multicommodity flow problem. Many other researchers also showed concrete research results in similar problems For a general network flow problem, the max-flow is within a factor of of the min-cut since each commodity can be optimized separately using 1/k of the capacity of each edge. This is not a good result especially in case of large numbers of commodities. Approximate max-flow min-cut theorems =Theorems of uniform multicommodity flow problems= There are two theorems first introduced by Tom Leighton and Satish Rao in 1988 and then extended in 1999. Theorem 2 gives a tighter bound compared to Theorem 1. Theorem 1. For any , there is an -node uniform multicommodity flow problem with max-flow and min-cut \\\\varphi for which f\\\\le O\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{\\\\log n}\\\\right). Theorem 2. For any uniform multicommodity flow problem, \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{\\\\log n}\\\\right)\\\\le f\\\\le\\\\varphi, where is the max-flow and \\\\varphi is the min-cut of the uniform multicommodity flow problem. To prove Theorem 2, both the max-flow and the min-cut should be discussed. For the max-flow, the techniques from duality theory of linear programming have to be employed. According to the duality theory of linear programming, an optimal distance function results in a total weight that is equal to the max-flow of the uniform multicommodity flow problem. For the min-cut, a 3-stage process has to be followed: Stage 1: Consider the dual of uniform commodity flow problem and use the optimal solution to define a graph with distance labels on the edges. Stage 2: Starting from a source or a sink, grow a region in the graph until find a cut of small enough capacity separating the root from its mate. Stage 3: Remove the region and repeat the process of stage 2 until all nodes get processed. =Generalized to product multicommodity flow problem= Theorem 3. For any product multicommodity flow problem with commodities, \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{\\\\log k}\\\\right)\\\\le f\\\\le \\\\varphi, where is the max- flow and \\\\varphi is the min-cut of the product multicommodity flow problem. The proof methodology is similar to that for Theorem 2; the major difference is to take node weights into consideration. =Extended to directed multicommodity flow problem= In a directed multicommodity flow problem, each edge has a direction, and the flow is restricted to move in the specified direction. In a directed uniform multicommodity flow problem, the demand is set to 1 for every directed edge. Theorem 4. For any directed uniform multicommodity flow problem with nodes, \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{\\\\log n}\\\\right)\\\\le f\\\\le \\\\varphi, where is the max-flow and \\\\varphi is the min-cut of the uniform multicommodity flow problem. The major difference in the proof methodology compared to Theorem 2 is that, now the edge directions need to be considered when defining distance labels in stage 1 and for growing the regions in stage 2, more details can be found in. Similarly, for product multicommodity flow problem, we have the following extended theorem: Theorem 5. For any directed product multicommodity flow problem with commodities, \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{\\\\log k}\\\\right)\\\\le f\\\\le\\\\varphi, where is the max- flow and \\\\varphi is the directed min-cut of the product multicommodity flow problem. Applications to approximation algorithms The above theorems are very useful to design approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, such as the graph partition problem and its variations. Here below we briefly introduce a few examples, and the in-depth elaborations can be found in Leighton and Rao (1999). =Sparsest cuts= A sparsest cut of a graph G=(V,E) is a partition for which the ratio of the number of edges connecting the two partitioned components over the product of the numbers of nodes of both components is minimized. This is a NP-hard problem, and it can be approximated to within O(\\\\log n) factor using Theorem 2. Also, a sparsest cut problem with weighted edges, weighted nodes or directed edges can be approximated within an O(\\\\log p) factor where is the number of nodes with nonzero weight according to Theorem 3, 4 and 5. =Balanced cuts and separators= In some applications, we want to find a small cut in a graph G=(V,E) that partitions the graph into nearly equal-size pieces. We usually call a cut b-balanced or a -separator (for ) if b\\\\pi(V)\\\\le\\\\pi(U)\\\\le(1-b)\\\\pi(V) where \\\\pi(U) is the sum of the node weights in . This is also an NP-hard problem. An approximation algorithm has been designed for this problem, and the core idea is that has a -balanced cut of size , then we find a -balanced cut of size O\\\\left(S\\\\log \\\\frac n b -b'\\\\right) for any where and . Then we repeat the process then finally obtain the result that total weight of the edges in the cut is at most O\\\\left(\\\\frac{S\\\\log n}{b-b'}\\\\right). =VLSI layout problems= It is helpful to find a layout of minimum size when designing a VLSI circuit. Such a problem can often be modeled as a graph embedding problem. The objective is to find an embedding for which the layout area is minimized. Finding the minimum layout area is also NP-hard. An approximation algorithm has been introduced and the result is O(\\\\log^6 n) times optimal. =Forwarding index problem= Given an -node graph and an embedding of K_n in , Chung et al. defined the forwarding index of the embedding to be the maximum number of paths (each corresponding to an edge of K_n) that pass through any node of . The objective is to find an embedding that minimizes the forwarding index. Using embedding approaches it is possible to bound the node and edge-forwarding indices to within an O(\\\\log n)-factor for every graph . =Planar edge deletion= Tragoudas uses the approximation algorithm for balanced separators to find a set of O\\\\left((R\\\\log n + \\\\sqrt{nR})\\\\log\\\\frac{n}{R}\\\\right) edges whose removal from a bounded-degree graph results in a planar graph, where is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from before it becomes planar. It remains an open question if there is a polylog times optimal approximation algorithm for .

He began his career at Middlesbrough without playing first-team football for them, and also played non-league football for a number of clubs in the north-east of England, mostly in the Northern League. He played either as a midfielder or in defence, whether at full back or in his preferred position of central defender. Football career Walklate was born in Durham, He was a member of Chester-le-Street Junior Schools representative football team for two years rather than the usual one, and played for Durham County Schools at under-16 level. He began his career with Middlesbrough, but never played for their first team, and after a trial, signed for Darlington ahead of the 2000–01 Football League season. He made his debut on 2 September 2000, as a second-half substitute in the Division Three match at home to York City which finished as a 1–1 draw, and made his first start in the League Cup visit to Division One club Nottingham Forest a few days later; he was replaced at half time by eventual match-winner Stuart Elliott. He also played in the next round of the competition, as Darlington lost 7–2 to Premier League club Bradford City. His short-term contract was extended, and he made six more appearances in all competitions, the last of which was on 26 December, before being released at the end of February 2001. According to the Northern Echo's correspondent, manager Gary Bennett was having to ask players, Walklate included, \\"to fill the boots of their of their quality predecessors – but the new bunch simply weren't up to the task\\". After his release, Walklate played two Northern Premier League matches for Blyth Spartans, and then one Scottish Second Division match as a triallist for Queen of the South, in a 2–2 draw with Berwick Rangers on 25 March. He signed for the club, remained in the starting eleven for the next fixture, also against Berwick, and also a draw, and appeared in five of Queens' six remaining matches, all but one as a starter. He returned to England and joined Durham City of the Northern League, with whom he was to spend four years. He assisted the team to four successive top-six finishes, including runners-up spot in 2003–04. In his first season, they progressed through seven rounds to the semi-final of the FA Vase only to lose to Whitley Bay on aggregate score, and Walklate scored his first goal for the club in the Northern League Challenge Cup final, in which Durham beat Shildon on a golden goal to secure their first ever senior trophy. His second and third seasons were disrupted by a double leg fracture suffered during a match in March 2003; he made his first-team comeback at the end of October. He scored just twice in league matches, at each end of the 2004–05 season: the late fourth in a 4–0 win away to Billingham Town, and a lob in a 1–1 draw at West Auckland Town. Walklate spent the 2005–06 season with Bedlington Terriers, and then joined Sunderland Nissan. He stayed with Nissan for two seasons, in the second of which he received the Manager's Player of the Year award. The same year, he was a member of the Hetton Lyons team that won the FA Sunday Cup. Walklate then spent three seasons with Shildon, a few months with Bishop Auckland, and a spell with Crook Town during which he helped them win the Northern League Division Two title.

Some residents had long commuted from the rural northeastern part of the county to Brownsville. But there were times where the ferry was closed down due to either excessively high river levels, low river levels, federal government sequesters and shutdowns. In 2013, Houchin's Ferry was closed and put on a hiatus due to various reasons, which caused a hardship on Edmonson County's travel between Brownsville and the Lincoln-Ollie-Demunbruns Store area. The fire department in Lincoln held a town hall-style meeting regarding the closing of the ferry, and citizens of Edmonson County were asked to call their congressmen and register their concerns about it. Many of Edmonson County's local officials attended that meeting. The ferry was declared out-of-service in October 2013 as part of the 2013 government shutdown.Bridgehunter.com  Houchin’s FerryMayor, Jeffery P (August 14, 2015). \\"Mammoth Cave filled with geologic wonders\\".

She has been the President of Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren donated Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research from 2005 to 2017. In 2014 Dr. Aiello was elected to the American Philosophical Society. She is currently President of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists.  Biography  Beginning in 1964, Aiello studied anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, earning a bachelor's degree, and later a master's degree (completed in 1970), in Anthropology. Also while working on her BA, she spent a year (1965–66) studying abroad at the University of Göttingen. She later received her PhD from the University of London in human evolution and anatomy. Aiello remained at the University of London where she became a professor of biological anthropology starting in 1995. Also during this time, she served as the co-managing editor for the Journal of Human Evolution (1993-1999). She was also the head of the UCL Anthropology Department (1996-2002) and the UCL Graduate School (2002-2005). Aiello is among other things a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Zoological Society of London, and since 2011 a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and since 2014, the American Philosophical Society. She also has co-authored the textbook, \\"An Introduction to Human Evolutionary Anatomy” (Academic Press, 1990), which uses the fossil record to predict the ways early hominids moved, ate, and looked. She is now currently the president of the Manhattan-based Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. Overall, Aiello has had 21 publications in the fields of physiology, anatomy, and archaeology (under anthropology). She also has collaborated with 25 co-authors between 1981 and 2010.  Research areas  Aiello studies evolutionary anthropology with focuses on human adaptation and life history, as well as the evolution of the brain, diet, language and cognition, and locomotion and its energetic costs. She has also researched Paleolithic hominids and their thermoregulation and climate adaptation. In collaboration with Peter Wheeler she developed the Expensive Tissue Hypothesis, regarding early humans, according to which there is an inverse correlation between the increase in brain size during human evolution and the parallel reduction of the digestive tract as a result of richer protein animal foods. Another idea she posited, was that higher reproductive costs would be the effect of this increase in brain size, which was compensated by the females increasing in size faster than the males. She highlighted that terrestriality (movement of early hominids from forest to savannahs) is the oldest stage that led to human civilization. The second stage was bipedialism and the third is encephalization (evoking larger brains). Aiello identified social implications of meat eating; one of which is food sharing, which does not happen often in primates, which strengthens the bond between female and offspring. The other societal implication is that meat eating likely led to division of labor between males and females (males hunting, females caring for dependent young). Meat eating did not cause larger brains, but simply made them possible.Leslie Aiello, Peter Wheeler: \\"The Expensive Tissue Hypothesis: The Brain and the Digestive System in Human and Primate Evolution.\\" In: Current Anthropology, Vol 36, No. 2, 1995, pp 199-221. doi: 10.1086 / 204350 Further, Aiello emphasized that large brain, long legs, creation and use of tools, probably evolved together, but not as a single package at the beginning of the lineage of Homo, especially in Australopithecus ancestors. Therefore, early humans were able to change with their changing environmental conditions, which allowed them to survive and spread from Africa around 1.85 million years ago. Aiello has said, \\"taken together, these data suggest that species of early Homo were more flexible in their dietary choices than other species.\\" And, \\"their flexible diet—probably containing meat—was aided by stone tool- assisted foraging that allowed our ancestors to exploit a range of resources.\\" Flexibility is a hallmark of human biology.  Wenner-Gren Foundation  Aiello is currently the president of this foundation. It was founded to support anthropological research in human origins, in 1941 in New York City, New York. Every year it gives out a total of $5 million in grants to further this research. \\"One of the real welcome trends in the field has been integrating other lines of study … to give us a much richer understanding of early humans.\\" It founded the journal Current Anthropology, and continues to publish it as well. This foundation seeks to support all areas of anthropology and other related disciplines that are concerned with human development, origins, and variation.  American Association of Physical Anthropologists  Aiello is currently the President of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (AAPA). In 2016 she received the Gabriel W Lasker Service Award in recognition of excellence in service to the AAPA, its members and the field of Physical Anthropology.

He is notable for founding Quaker settlements that eventually became Newmarket and Pickering in what is now Ontario, Canada. Life and work Rogers was born into poverty in Lyme, Connecticut Colony, on May 22, 1756. His ties are to James Rogers (c. 1615-before 1687) , whom is believed to have arrived in America before 1646 from Stratford, Warwickshire, England as part of the Puritan migration to New England.https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rogers-138https://www.geni.com/people/James- Rogers-of-New-London/6000000006728052798 He was born out of wedlock to Timothy Rogers Sr. (1735-1774)http://www.geni.com/people/Timothy-Rogers- Sr/6000000033330156111 and Mary Huntleyhttps://www.newmarkettoday.ca/remember- this/a-closer-look-at-timothy-rogers-father-of-newmarket-2014643 and treated like an orphan. He spent most of his childhood hired out to earn his own keep, and had only three weeks of formal education. Though raised in Baptist circles, in his early twenties, Rogers joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Rogers and his wife pioneered farms in Danby, Vermont, Saratoga, New York, and then Ferrisburgh, Vermont. This was a common pattern in those days; the family would buy, or be granted, a plot of undeveloped land, develop it, then sell it and take the profits to buy a bigger plot. In the mid-1790s, Rogers visited fellow Quakers such as Samuel Moore in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, and Seth Coleman in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia,The Best Man for Settling New Country …the Journal of Timothy Rogers, ed. Densmore and Schrauwers, Canadian Friends Historical Association, 2000, p.80 but he decided on Upper Canada for his next frontier adventure. “In 1797 Timothy Rogers placed before his Monthly Meeting ‘a desire to go westward to look for some new settlements’. But he met with no encouragement from the overseers of the meeting so he dropped the subject for a time.” The Quakers in Canada, A History by A.G.Dorland, Ryerson Press, 1968, p.60. However, the sense of calling remained and “Rogers came to Yonge Street from Vermont in 1800…. He obviously liked what he saw, for he agreed to settle forty farms of two hundred acres each in the district. In the winter of 1800-1801, Rogers and his family moved, by sleigh in the dead of winter, to Yonge Street.\\" The Canadian Quaker History Journal No. 65, Canadian Friends Historical Association, 2000, p.1 This group of pioneers met all the conditions of land grants and by 1804, they were also recognized as an official meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. The Yonge Street settlement grew into the town of Newmarket. In 1809, Rogers started a second Quaker colony in Pickering. He believed this was his calling in life. In his journal, he declared, “It is well known I have a great gift from the Lord to settle new country; I have settled eight new farms or plantations, laid out one town, where I went first. “ Densmore and Schrauwers, p.109 There were already Quaker colonies at Pelham in the Niagara Peninsula and Adolphustown on the Bay of Quinte that had been started by refugees fleeing persecution by Patriots during the American Revolutionary War. Rogers saw the need to have a Quaker meeting house at a central location between Newmarket and the earlier colonies. The Meeting House at 17030 Yonge Street, built in 1810, still stands. Rogers started by buying 800 acres and then moving “his family from Yonge Street to Duffin’s Creek, where he operated what was probably the first grist and saw mill in the township.” Dorland, p.99 In 1810, he “went back to the United States and returned with another company of settlers who were settled in Pickering Township, east of Duffin’s Creek. For his services, Rogers received a grant of several hundred acres of land near the present village of Pickering.”Dorland, pp.99, 100 Death and legacy Rogers died in 1834, after 2 marriages and 21 children. He is buried in the Friends Cemetery at Mill Street south of Kingston Road in Ajax, Ontario. His journal has been re-published by the Canadian Friends Historical Association.

We can tell you what, when, and where, how big, how little, how hot, how cold, how fast, how slow…almost anything that you could express in numbers or other data. But the why, the why not, and the what next--answers to those questions represent the invisible, unpredictable, immeasurable context undergirding the exacting, nitty-gritty work of science. Those perspectives are not science or technology themselves, but they always hover nearby.
