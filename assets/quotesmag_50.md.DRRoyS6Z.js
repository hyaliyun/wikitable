Astle and Matt Ember, based upon the novel of the same name by Robert Kimmel Smith. It stars Robert De Niro as Ed and Oakes Fegley as his grandson Peter, along with Uma Thurman, Rob Riggle, Laura Marano, Cheech Marin, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Walken. The film is about a young boy who works to get his grandfather to move out of his room after he moves in with his family. The film was released in the United States on October 9, 2020 by 101 Studios, and abroad beginning in August 2020 by Brookdale Studios, and received generally negative reviews from critics. Plot After accidentally stealing from a grocery store due to having trouble with the self-checkouts and causing a scene with one of the workers, recently widowed Ed (Robert De Niro) is visited by his daughter Sally Decker (Uma Thurman), who wants him to move in with her family. Ed does not want to leave his house because he built it himself. Sally convinces Ed to move in with her nonetheless, and gives him her son Peter's (Oakes Fegley) bedroom. Peter is not happy about giving his room to his grandfather and being moved to the attic. Ed is welcomed by Sally's husband Arthur (Rob Riggle) and two daughters, Mia (Laura Marano) and Jenny (Poppy Gagnon). During his first day moved in, Ed spends most of his time in his new room, sitting in his chair and looking at the sky, still thinking about his late wife. Peter then tells his friends about his grandfather moving in with his family and living in his room. After a miserable first night in his new room, Peter decides to declare war. Ed agrees to war, as long as they follow the agreed upon rules of engagement: they cannot damage other people's belongings and cannot tell the family about this. Peter pulls a series of pranks, including replacing Ed's shaving cream with quick-drying foam and damaging his record player. Ed gets back at Peter with pranks including removing the screws from all of Peter's furniture and rewriting his school report. Ed turns to his friends Danny (Cheech Marin) and Jerry (Christopher Walken) for some advice. Over time, Ed begins to spend time with his granddaughters and son-in-law and learns how to use modern technology, such as self-checkouts and apps. Sally learns that Mia is dating a boy named Russell, who she does not approve of. Ed invites Jerry, Danny, and Diane (Jane Seymour) (a store worker that Ed befriended) to play dodgeball against Peter and his friends. Peter and his friends win the first round, but Ed and his team manage to beat them during the second round. However, during the third round, Danny's jaw is injured; as a result, the game is declared a tie. Later, Peter pushes the button on Ed's emergency call necklace, and Ed picks Peter up from school to take him fishing. The two discover that it is illegal to fish there. Ed then takes Peter to his old house and explains that he left some secrets in the walls. Ed learns that Peter is being bullied, so he, Danny, and Jerry throw the bully in a dumpster. At Jenny's Christmas-themed birthday party, Peter keeps his promise about not pulling any pranks. Peter rigs up an ejector seat for Ed, who is supposed to be playing the part of Santa that night. Unfortunately, a last-minute change results in Jerry being dressed up as Santa. Throughout the party, Peter and Ed are asked to help out. Instead, they continue to prank each other, including spraying bottles at each other and Peter plugging the cord to the lights as Ed checks them, electrocuting Ed. As a result of their hijinks, they inadvertently reveal their war with each other to everyone. Jerry gets ejected from his chair, resulting in further property damage and injuries to multiple guests. Ed is injured and taken to the hospital. As punishment, Arthur and Sally place Peter and Mia under \\"work arrest\\" for six months. Russell shows up; Sally initially seems angry at him, but instead welcomes him. Sally goes to pick up Ed from the hospital, but learns that he has already checked out and his brother Chuck brought him to his old house. Peter decides to make amends, and begs Ed to move back in with the family. The two finally reconcile, as Sally listens. As time passes, Ed and Peter seem to finally be getting along until Ed leaves one day to be with Diane who are now in a relationship. Peter looks on angrily, declaring a war on both them as the they leave.

The Blacksburg Volunteer Rescue Squad was established in 1950 as an all-volunteer EMS agency providing free service to a community of approximately 55,000 residents, including approximately half of Montgomery County, Virginia, and the Town of Blacksburg, which is home to Virginia Tech. The squad has approximately 120 members, including full-time community residents with other jobs and high school and college students. Mission statement We are the providers of pre-hospital emergency medical care and rescue services for the Town of Blacksburg and parts of Montgomery County.  History  Blacksburg Volunteer Life Saving and First Aid Crew, Inc. was organized in the spring of 1950, with 25 active members. The first vehicle was a Chevrolet panel truck purchased from Blacksburg Motor Company at a cost of $1,740. The vehicle was housed at the Blacksburg Esso gas station until a shed could be built near the old two-bay fire station behind the old Town Hall. The first activity report submitted to the Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads dated September 1, 1951, to September 1, 1952 listed 96 calls for that year. In 1953, due to most members also serving on the Blacksburg Volunteer Fire Department, the two groups merged becoming the Blacksburg Volunteer Fire Department and First Aid Crew. The group stayed together until January 1, 1986. At that time, due to the growth of the area and the time and training required, they split into two separate organizations. In 1957, Blacksburg Town Council provided funds for the construction of a building to house the equipment of the Blacksburg Volunteer Fire and First Aid Crew. The building on Progress Street was designed to provide space for four vehicles, a meeting hall and a storage room. In 1958, the town annexed a portion of the county, thus doubling the population and adding a considerable number of residences and business establishments. All this new territory became the responsibility of the crew. In 1969 due to state regulations, most of the area funeral homes discontinued ambulance service, placing an extra burden on the rescue crew. In 1971, the crew bought its first custom-built ambulance at a cost of about $12,000 (modern ambulances cost ~ $150,000). The crew completed its first Emergency Medical Technician's course in 1972. This growth required some expansion of the crew and of the crew hall. In 1981 the Progress Street station was expanded and the crew purchased its first Advanced Life Support ambulance. In 1986 the BVRS became an independent organization. In 1989, for the first time in its 39-year history, the squad brought home its first two trophies from the Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squad's annual convention held at Virginia Beach. The squad continues to grow at a phenomenal rate to keep up with the growth of Blacksburg. With no end in site for the town‚Äôs growth, the squad will continue to adapt and implement the latest in life saving techniques and equipment. Summer of 2016 saw BVRS move into a new purpose built station, Station 5, on the corner of Progress and Patrick Henry. In 2017, BVRS received the Virginia Governor‚Äôs EMS Award for Outstanding EMS Agency. = Major Incident =  Solar House  Sept. 30, 2003 - An accident at an apartment building known as the ‚ÄúSolar House‚Äù resulted in a fatality and multiple injuries. A punk rock concert at a Blacksburg rental house where man died and others were injured after falling from a third-story window. BVRS responded and transported many patients.  Virginia Tech Shooting  The April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, was at the time the worst mass shooting in U.S. history by one gunman where 32 students and faculty were shot and killed. BVRS responded with six ambulances and 42 BVRS members. * West Ambler Johnston - Three BVRS Advanced Life Support (ALS) members responded to a mutual aid request to West Ambler Johnston Residence Hall for two gun shot victims. One patient was transported to Roanoke Memorial Hospital‚Äôs Trauma 1 Center by BVRS. * Norris Hall - A BVRS medic was on the Blacksburg Police Emergency Response Team (ERT) team that went into Norris Hall, and he and a Virginia Tech Rescue Squad Medic initiated triage and of the victims. * ICS and Unified Command established. * After Norris Hall was cleared and secured, three BVRS members went in assess casualties and confirm status of deceased victims. * At least 17 students and faculty were transported to regional hospitals or treated on scene by the various EMS agencies that were on scene. Besides BVRS ambulances, there were ambulances from Christiansburg Rescue, Carilion Transport Services, Salem Rescue, Newport Rescue and other agencies responded with ambulances not knowing how many patients might need to be transported. After the Virginia State Police forensic examiners completed scene examination and documentation, BVRS transported or coordinated the transport of 32 victims to the Medial Examiner‚Äôs Officer in Roanoke.  Carbon Monoxide Poisoning  On Sunday, August 19, 2007, a total of 23 students were overcome by carbon monoxide in a Blacksburg apartment complex and were taken the hospital. Five of these patients were airlifted to UVA Medical Center or Duke University Medical Center for serious complications from the carbon monoxide poisoning.  Federal Mogul Explosion  December 31, 2010, three people were injured when an explosion tore open a section of the Federal-Mogul building in Blacksburg. The explosion occurred around 9:30 a.m. The first emergency responders on the scene reported at least two people with serious burns who were airlifted to Baptist Hospital at Wake Forest University in North Carolina  Cave Rescue  On a late winter afternoon in 2011, multiple fire, rescue and EMS units were dispatched to the edge of a rural farm for a patient trapped in the entrance of a cave. Before the 12-hour rescue was successfully completed at 3:00 A.M., over 50 first responders and a medical evacuation helicopter team were involved in the slow procedure of freeing the patient in 14-degree temperature.

The system originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 22, and ultimately dissipated as an extratropical cyclone near Atlantic Canada on October 10\\\\. Late on September 29, it began a period of explosive intensification that brought it to Category 5 strength early on October 1\\\\. It weakened slightly and remained a Category 4 until its landfalls in Haiti and Cuba, afterwards it traversed through the Bahamas and paralleled the coast of Florida until making landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane. Matthew later transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone on October 10. The cyclone was responsible for roughly 600 deaths (with initial reports of up to 1,600), making Matthew the deadliest since Stan in 2005, and caused $15.1 billion (2016 USD) in damages, which made it the costliest since Sandy in 2012. Matthew caused its most destructive entry as it made landfall in Haiti on October 4, causing catastrophic damage and over 500 died as a result. The storm also threatened to be the first major hurricane to strike the United States since Wilma in 2005, however it veered slightly more to the east and remained offshore. The major strike ended up coming a year later. However, torrential rainfall fell in the Carolinas, causing extreme flash flooding. Even as Matthew turned extratropical and moved away from the coast, rivers were still overflowing, and it would take many weeks for the rivers to fall back to average levels. Overall, Matthew caused $10 billion damage in the United States. Genesis GOES-13 satellite animation of the precursor wave to Matthew developing as it traversed the Atlantic basin from September 23 to 28. On September 22‚Äì23, a vigorous tropical wave, embedded within the monsoon trough, exited the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean near Guinea Bissau. The wave coincided with an upper-level trough and an isolated plume of moisture; however, little convection was present. Located unusually close to the equator, roughly 8‚Äì10¬∞N, the system was unable to acquire significant spin via the Coriolis force and struggled to develop as it moved rapidly west at . Despite this, the three top forecast models for hurricanes‚Äîthe GFS, ECMWF, and UKMET‚Äîindicated the system would likely become a tropical cyclone over the Caribbean Sea. Two days later, the wave passed south of Cape Verde, and was assessed as having a high probability of tropical cyclogenesis within five days by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). With environmental conditions favoring slow development, thunderstorm activity increased along the wave on September 25, which organized more during the subsequent days while approaching the Lesser Antilles. By September 27, the wave was producing sustained tropical storm-force winds as reported by the Hurricane Hunters, although the system lacked the closed circulation required for classification as a tropical cyclone. While the system was passing near Barbados, radar imagery in the Lesser Antilles indicated that the circulation was becoming better organized. Another Hurricane Hunters flight on September 28 confirmed that a closed circulation developed, recorded surface winds of , and observed hurricane-force gusts at the plane's level. These data in conjunction with microwave satellite imagery indicate the system became a tropical cyclone‚Äîearning the designation Tropical Storm Matthew‚Äîby 12:00 UTC that day; at this time, the storm was centered 20 mi (30 km) west-northwest of Barbados. Steered by a strong ridge over the Western Atlantic, Matthew traveled generally west with its center passing between the islands of St. Lucia and St. Vincent before emerging over the Caribbean Sea. Throughout the remainder of September 28, Matthew struggled to develop an inner-core and banding features, preventing intensification. However, deep convection gradually organized around the center. Environmental conditions ahead of the cyclone‚Äîincluding ample moisture fueled by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and high oceanic heat content‚Äîfavored at least gradual intensification, with the exception of a climatologically unfavorable zone well south of Haiti. Somewhat increased shear on September 29 displaced convection to the east of Matthew's center, leaving behind an exposed circulation. Despite this, aircraft reconnaissance that morning revealed the storm to have deepened somewhat‚Äîwith a central pressure around . Flight level winds increased to and the aircraft's stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) observed surface winds of . Rapid intensification the \\"blob\\", just east of the storm's core. By 18:00 UTC on September 29, data from aircraft reconnaissance revealed Matthew to have intensified into a hurricane‚Äîhaving sustained winds of at least ‚Äîby which time the cyclone was located 190 mi (300 km) northeast of Cura√ßao. Convection soon redeveloped over the hurricane's center and banding features to the east and northeast became better organized. A wide eye developed over Matthew's center, with reconnaissance, microwave satellite imagery, and radar imagery from Cura√ßao corroborating the increased organization. Early on September 30, Matthew began a period of rapid intensification despite strong southwesterly wind shear. The system reached Category 2 strength on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale by 06:00 UTC on September 30. During this time, the mid-level ridge to the hurricane's north shifted into the northern Caribbean, prompting Matthew to take a west-southwest track. Upper-level poleward outflow became established over the circulation while another channel began developing to the southwest; these served to ventilate the hurricane and enable further intensification. By 12:00 UTC, Matthew reached major hurricane status‚Äîhaving sustained winds of at least . Intensifying at an \\"extraordinary\\" pace, Matthew reached Category 4 strength by 18:00 UTC. The rapid intensification culminated during the overnight of September 30 ‚Äì October 1, with Matthew achieving its peak intensity at Category 5 status by 00:00 UTC on October 1, making it the first such storm in the Atlantic basin since Felix in 2007. The hurricane's satellite presentation had markedly improved, with cloud tops colder than in the central dense overcast surrounding a wide eye. Throughout the explosive intensification period, Matthew was embedded within a broad region of west-southwesterly wind shear, as calculated by the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) model using a aerial grid. Shear of this intensity normally prevents or limits storm intensification. Reduction to a aerial grid in post-storm analysis revealed significantly lower wind shear at a localized level, calculated at . As a result of the over-analyzed wind shear, the NHC did not anticipate the magnitude of Matthew's rapid intensification. Based on a peak SFMR measurement of , the NHC estimated peak winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) with a central pressure of 942 mbar (hPa; 27.82 inHg). At its peak intensity, the storm was centered less than 90 mi (150 km) north of Punta Gallinas, Colombia, at 13.4 degrees north. This made Matthew the southernmost Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin, surpassing Hurricane Ivan. Around the time of peak intensity, nighttime visible imagery from the Suomi NPP satellite revealed gravity waves over the hurricane. Matthew featured unusually abundant lightning in its eyewall. Additionally, a rare phenomenon known as lightning sprites were observed above the storm as far away as Puerto Rico. The roles of all three occurrences, if any, in the intensification of Matthew‚Äîand tropical cyclones in general‚Äîis presently unknown. =The \\"blob\\"= For several days in early October, an unusual thunderstorm complex developed to the east of Matthew. The feature drew the attention of meteorologists and was colloquially referred to as the \\"blob\\". The complex developed from a convergence zone that developed when southwesterly flow from the hurricane's counter-clockwise circulation interacting with prevailing easterlies over the Caribbean Sea. A vorticity streamer extending from the Andes northward may have played a role in the development of this feature. Dr. Stephanie Zick noted the \\"blob\\" was consistent with the stationary band complex described by Willoughby et al. 1984. Intense thunderstorms within the complex, potentially supercells, produced prolific lightning. Northward turn to Haiti and Cuba Rainbow loop of Matthew making landfall in Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula on October 4 Matthew's tenure at Category 5 status soon ceased as its eye lost definition during the morning of October 1, resulting in slight weakening. Clouds later obscured Matthew's eye and its central pressure rose; however, its core remained incredibly small with an average radius of maximum wind of . Additional weakening took place and peak winds fell to 145 mph (230 km/h) while the central pressure rose to 947 mbar (hPa; 27.97 inHg). Although meteorologists noted the potential for an eyewall replacement cycle that evening, microwave satellite imagery never indicated that one was beginning. The inner core of Matthew proved resilient and the hurricane restrengthened that night; the radius of maximum winds also contracted further to . A NOAA reconnaissance aircraft measured flight-level winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), surface winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), and a central pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg) around 21:00 UTC. During this time, the storm's motion became erratic as it entered a weakness in the ridge previously steering it west. It soon executed a small, counter-clockwise loop and turned north. After briefly remaining stationary, Matthew slowly progressed to the north-northwest early on October 2 between a trough over the Gulf of Mexico and the ridge over the western Atlantic. A large upper-level anticyclone developed over the hurricane and enabled Matthew to remain an intense system throughout the day. A dry slot developed along the southwestern edge of the circulation during the afternoon and some weakening took place; however, the storm's inner-core soon reorganized. Cloud tops cooled around the hurricane's wide eye and reconnaissance aircraft found decreasing central pressures. Concurrently, Matthew attained its secondary peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h). For unknown reasons, the southwestern quadrant of the eyewall broke apart during the overnight of October 2‚Äì3. Air Route Surveillance Radar imagery from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, showing the inner-core structure of Matthew as it crossed Haiti and Cuba on October 4\\\\. The hurricane's winds oscillated within the Category 4 range for several days as environmental conditions remained conducive to intense hurricanes. In a rare occurrence, Matthew passed directly over a NOAA buoy 42058 at 07:47 UTC; the device measured a pressure of 942.9 mbar (hPa; 27.85 inHg). Furthermore, it revealed significant upwelling of at least 3 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F) which served to limit Matthew's strength. Some intensification took place after the hurricane cleared the region of cooler water, and late on October 3, the hurricane reached its minimum central pressure of . The core had enlarged slightly by this time, with an estimated radius of maximum winds. At 11:00 UTC the next day, Matthew made landfall near Les Anglais, Haiti with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a central pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964. Despite disruption from the mountainous terrain of Haiti, the hurricane's eye remained well-defined as it traversed the Windward Passage. By 00:00 UTC on October 5, the eye of Matthew made landfall on the eastern tip of the Cuban peninsula near the town of Juaco with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a central pressure near . Winds of with gusts to were measured at Punta de Mais√≠ Airport. The Bahamas and Southeastern United States Radar loop of Matthew east of Florida late on October 6\\\\. Double eyewalls can be seen in the hurricane Matthew spent roughly five hours over eastern Cuba before emerging over the southwestern Atlantic. The hurricane's eye disappeared from infrared imagery, and it weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, due to the interaction with the terrain of Cuba. Some further weakening occurred as it traversed through the Bahamas ‚Äì whom had previously been pounded by Hurricane Joaquin a little over a year prior at a similar intensity ‚Äì but began to reintensify, with cooling cloud tops around an eye that was trying to reform. By the next morning, the central pressure had fallen to and the eye reappeared and subsequently warmed. Shortly afterwards, intensification resumed, and Matthew re-strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane later that day. The central pressure fell to , although the winds decreased slightly. Shortly afterwards, the hurricane made landfall near Grand Bahama Island with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a central pressure of . By the evening of October 6, the hurricane had begun to parallel fairly close to the coast of Florida. Throughout the night and into the early morning hours on October 7, the National Hurricane Center consistently reminded the public that \\"a small deviation of the track to the left of the NHC forecast could bring the core of a major hurricane onshore\\"; had it done so, it would have been the first to move ashore in the United States since Hurricane Wilma nearly 11 years prior. Subsequently, the hurricane again weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle. As a result, the hurricane fell below Category 4 intensity early on October 7. By 00:00 UTC on October 8, the storm weakened below major hurricane intensity, a status it had held for nearly eight days since attaining it on September 30 while in the Caribbean. By late on October 7, as Matthew advanced towards the Carolinas, paralleling the coast of Georgia, the southern eyewall of the hurricane had broken apart, as seen from Doppler radar, subsequently, the associated satellite presentation had started to become elongated. A more rapid weakening phase took place and Matthew weakened to a Category 1 hurricane just before making landfall at the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge in South Carolina with sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a central pressure of ‚Äì making it the most intense hurricane (by central pressure) to strike the United States since Hurricane Irene in 2011, until Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and the first hurricane to make landfall in the state of South Carolina since Gaston in 2004. It was also the first hurricane to make landfall north of Florida in October since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. =Unrealised turn south= The National Hurricane Center's five-day \\"cone of error\\" forecast for Hurricane Matthew at 5:00 p.m. EDT on October 6 depicting the potential clockwise loop off the Southeastern United States While the hurricane traversed the Bahamas on October 5, the complex interaction between Matthew, a trough moving off the East Coast, a ridge over New England, and then Tropical Storm Nicole near Bermuda led to unusually high uncertainty in its future track. For several days, meteorologists at the NHC forecast the hurricane to turn south while near the Carolinas and make a loop toward Florida and impact the state a second time. If such an event took place, it would have been the first such occurrence on record of a hurricane striking the east coast of Florida twice. For the loop to have taken place, a trough moving toward the Eastern United States, associated with the jet stream, would have to \\"miss\\" Matthew and not cause the hurricane to accelerate out to sea. This, in turn, would have allowed a building ridge over New England to force Matthew back south. Thereafter, interaction with Tropical Storm Nicole (via the Fujiwhara effect) would have further prevented Matthew from turning east away from land. The GFS model in particular consistently showed this scenario for several days, even taking the remnants of Matthew into the Gulf of Mexico and later Louisiana‚Äîa track reminiscent of Hurricane Betsy in 1965. Barry Keim, a climatologist at Louisiana State University, noted a large margin of error with this potential track while forecasters at the NHC declined commentary to keep focus on the immediate landfall threat. Jerry Combs of the Melbourne, Florida, National Weather Service Office reiterated the position of the NHC: \\"Right now, we're not even worried about [the potential loop]. We need to get through this first round then we can look into the possibilities and what the storm could do.\\" Demise By the time Matthew had made landfall in South Carolina early on October 8, the cyclone had begun to lose its tropical characteristics as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies. The wind field expanded and became asymmetric, and much of the deepest convection migrated to the north of the center, stretching all the way into parts of the Northeastern United States. As Matthew moved eastwards at about , its low-level circulation began to separate from its mid- to-upper circulation due to increasing wind shear. Throughout the night, the structure of Matthew began to resemble more of that of an extratropical cyclone, and by 09:00 UTC on October 9, Matthew became extratropical while located southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Due to a policy change after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the National Hurricane Center continued to issue advisories on the extratropical remnants of Matthew, due to tropical- storm force winds still affecting parts of the Carolinas. However, by 21:00 UTC, the agency terminated advisories on the cyclone while located east of Cape Hatteras. The remnants of the storm persisted for another day before they were absorbed by a cold front south of Canada on October 10.

Early life and education Ilse Berardo was born in Einbeck, Lower Saxony to Henny Everlien and Karl Everlien, an engineer. While in high school she volunteered as a Lutheran catechist in at the local parish, a role that she holds until she enrolls in University of Marburg in order to study Theology, in 1974. Berardo graduates in 1981, having presented her bachelor's thesis to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Brunswick, in the city of Wolfenb√ºttel. Ministry Ilse Berardo started out as a preacher of Madeira's Lutheran church in 1987, when the German-Speaking Evangelical Parish was established. At the time she had a special license issued by the bishop to officiate celebrations. While in Madeira Berardo has always been active at the local Lutheran church on a voluntary basis. The main dignitaries from the Lutheran Church in Portugal, as well as the Lutheran auxiliary bishop of Hannover, came to her ordination ceremony in recognition for her religious commitment to local German community. As a Pastor, Isle is also known for her extensive network of ecumenical contacts in Madeira Island.

She was born in Newark, New Jersey to Anna Lisker Mandelman and Louis Mandelman, Jewish immigrants who imbued their children with their social justice values and love of the arts. After studying art in New York City and being employed by the Works Progress Administration Federal Arts Project (WPA- FAP), Mandelman arrived in Taos, New Mexico, with her artist husband Louis Leon Ribak in 1944 at the age of 32. Mandelman's oeuvre consisted mainly of paintings, prints, and collages. Much of her work was highly abstract, including her representational pieces such as cityscapes, landscapes, and still lifes. Through the 1940s, her paintings feature richly textured surfaces and a subtly modulated, often subdued color palette. New Mexico landscape and culture had a profound influence on Mandelman's style, influencing it towards a brighter palette, more geometric forms, flatter surfaces, and more crisply defined forms. One critic wrote that the \\"twin poles\\" of her work were Cubism and Expressionism. Her work is included in many major public collections, including large holdings at the University of New Mexico Art Museum and Harwood Museum of Art. Early life Beatrice Mandelman was born on December 31, 1912, in Newark, New Jersey, to Jewish immigrant parents who imbued their children with progressive social values and love of the arts. By age 12, Mandelman had begun taking classes at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Art and determined that she would become an artist. Throughout her formative years, Mandelman developed an enduring international sensibility and absorbed influences from various forms of Modernism. In 1924 artist Louis Lozowick, a family friend, returned from a four year sojourn in Europe and Russia and was an important source of information about Russian Constructivism and other avant garde developments abroad. Mandelman met graphic designer and illustrator Robert Jonas, who introduced her to Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, and other New York vanguard artists. Education From 1930-32, Mandelman attended New Jersey College for Women in New Brunswick, part of Rutgers University, and then the Newark School for Fine and Industrial Art, where she studied with Social Realist painter Bernar Gussow. Gussow had studied in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and introduced Mandelman to Cubism and the School of Paris. Her plans to study in Paris, however, were interrupted by the death of her father in 1932 and the Great Depression, and it was not until 1948, that Mandelman was able to realize her dream of Paris, where she studied in the studio of Fernand L√©ger, became friends with Cubist painter Francis Picabia. WPA Years: 1935-1942 Between 1935 and 1942, Mandelman was employed the Works Progress Administration's Federal Arts Project (WPA), first as a muralist and later as a printmaker. In 1937-38 she was sent by the WPA to Butte, Montana, to work in the Project Art Center teaching art to children and adults. Upon returning to New York, she resumed her studies at the Art Students League to learn printmaking, and joined the WPA Graphic Arts Division. She became one of the original members of the Silk Screen Unit, who, under the leadership of Anthony Velonis, transformed what had been primarily a commercial medium into an artistic one. Her work in this new medium received an immediate and enthusiastic response. By 1941, her work was associated with the early phase of the New York School, and by the early 1940s her prints began to be acquired by museums and were included in exhibitions at major venues such as the Chicago Art Institute, Museum of Modern Art (New York) and the National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.). Mandelman worked for the WPA until 1942, when it was disbanded.Bea Mandelman: The Social Realist Prints, Harwood Museum of Art, exhibition brochure, 2012, essay by MaLin Wilson-Powell Although her style would gradually evolve from Social Realism to abstraction, her works from this period reflect a leftist political bent that continued throughout her life, and would resurface later in a series of collages against the Vietnam War that she created in the 1960s and 70s. Taos Years Mandelman married fellow artist Louis Ribak in 1942. (1902 ‚Äì 1979), a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania. While still in New York the couple became involved in the early years of the New York School, including vacationing with Jackson Pollock in the summer of 1943, as his career trajectory was taking off. Ribak also became politically active with associates who were under FBI surveillance. In 1944, Mandelman and her husband visited the artist John Sloan in Santa Fe and traveled up to Taos, which so appealed to them that they impulsively decided to settle there. By the time Mandelman and Ribak arrived, the Taos art colony was already a well- established community of mainly representational artists. Aside from Thomas Benrimo and part-time resident Emil Bisttram there were few local artists working in a Modernist vein, and no local galleries showing Modernist art. Taos offered artists the proximity to Native American culture at Taos Pueblo, spectacular natural surroundings, a low cost of living, and a geographic location that was at the crossroads between the East and West Coasts, and a convenient stopover on the route to and from Mexico. A generation earlier, during the 1920s, it was this same combination of factors that had attracted the New York socialite and arts patron Mabel Dodge Luhan to establish herself in Taos with a salon that attracted many of her day's most important Modernist artistic talents, writers, intellectuals, and activists. She took Mandelman and Ribak under her wing and included them in her book \\"Taos and Its Artists\\" (1947). Mandelman adapted well to life in the Taos art colony. She and Ribak connected with other modern artists settling in Taos in the 1940s and 1950s, such as Edward Corbett and Agnes Martin, and this group became known as the Taos Moderns. In 1947, Mandelman and Ribak founded the Taos Valley Art School, where they taught until it closed in 1953. The school attracted a convergence of New York and San Francisco Bay area artists. Many were World War II veterans taking advantage of the opportunity to study through the G.I. Bill.Witt, David L., \\"Modernists in Taos: From Dasburg to Martin\\", Red Crane Books, 2002 The school closed in 1953 after losing GI Bill funding. Mandelamn and Ribak decamped for New York where they lived from 1954-56 before returning to their home in Taos.Perspective: Beatrice Mandelman [1912-1998] Gussie Fauntleroy Western Art & Architecture, October 2012 Her work was included in the 1940 MoMA show American Color Prints Under $10. The show was organized as a vehicle for bringing affordable fine art prints to the general public. Mandelman was also included in the 1947 and 1951 Dallas Museum of Fine Arts exhibitions of the National Serigraph Society. Far from the strictures of the mainstream art world, Mandelman found the creative freedom to develop her own distinct style, which merged an Abstract Expressionist sensibility with inspiration from the light, color, landscape, and cultures of the American West. Other influences derived from Mandelman's love of adventure. She traveled widely throughout her lifetime, visiting South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa and living for extended periods in Mexico, where she and Ribak would go virtually every year to escape the cold northern New Mexico winters Like many of their contemporaries, including their Santa Fe friend, designer Alexander Girard, they were enamored of folk art and collected it. The 1950s: The Taos Moderns During these years the art world was heavily male dominated and the Taos Art Colony was no exception. In the 1950s when fellow abstractionist Agnes Martin arrived on the scene, she and Mandelman became close friends. The friendship between the two women became strained when Martin moved back to New York in 1958, and began her professional ascent. Remaining in Taos, Mandelman was disappointed in the lack of commensurate recognition her own work. Tensions aside, the friendship between Mandelman and Martin resumed in 1992, when Martin returned to Taos, where she lived until her death in 2004.Bea Remembered: Robert Ellis catalogue essay for Harwood Museum 2001 exhibition 'The Triumph of Beatrice Mandelman' Mandelman and Ribak's home served as the gathering place for an informal group of artists who began calling themselves the Taos Moderns. Key members of this group included Edward Corbett, Agnes Martin, Oli Sihvonen and Clay Spohn. Mandelman was included in a 1952 group exhibition \\"Taos Painting Yesterday and Today,\\" organized by Ted Egri, at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. It was the first museum exhibition to address the development of Modernist art in Taos. By the 1950s, Taos was home to over 200 artists and 18 art galleries. Mandelman and some other local artists organized two artist cooperative galleries, the Ruins Gallery, named in honor of the crumbling adobe that housed it, in 1952, followed by the founding of the Taos Artists' Association and its cooperative, the Stables Gallery. In 1955 Mandelman and Ribak also established Gallery Ribak, occasional public exhibitions in their home, mostly showcasing their own work and that of a few of their friends. The 1960s - 1980s Mandelman preferred to work in series, a total of 33 starting in the 1940s until her death in 1998. Interspersed were exuberant collages, a medium she first began to explore in the 1950s and continued throughout her career.Bea Mandelman: Collage, Harwood Museum of Art, exhibition brochure, essay by MaLin Wilson-Powell, 2012 After Ribak's death in 1979, Mandelman remained in Taos. The 1990s: Final Years In her final decade, Mandelman never lost her passion for art or stopped painting despite debilitating bouts with cancer. In May, 1998, two months before she died, Mandelman was featured in an article in Forbes magazine,Goff, Roberts, \\"The Arts: Hidden light\\", Forbes, 05/04/1998 which drew international attention and sales. Her spirits buoyed by recognition and sales, and propped up by her caregivers as she painted, Mandelman was able to produce thirty-one works comprising the Winter Series. She died of cancer on June 25, 1998, in her Taos home, at the age of 85. Legacy The Mandelman-Ribak Foundation was established to preserve the legacy of Mandelman and her husband. Among other activities it catalogued a half century of their work held in the Mandelman-Ribak Collection. In 2014, the collection and associated personal papers were donated to the University of New Mexico., an endowment for future exhibitions and scholarship, and the naming of the Mandelman-Ribak and Caroline Lee and Bob Ellis Galleries at the UNM Harwood Museum of Art in Taos. The University's Zimmerman Library Center for Southwest Research received the extensive personal papers of both artists, including the notes and poetry written by Mandelman over the years References Category:1912 births Category:1998 deaths Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American women artists Category:American abstract artists Category:American women painters Category:Jewish American artists Category:Artists from Newark, New Jersey Category:Artists from Taos, New Mexico Category:Art Students League of New York alumni Category:Modern painters Category:Rutgers University alumni ","title":"Beatrice Mandelman"},{"id":"51896532","text":"Grand Merdeka is a shoplots comprising shopping centre, offices and mixed multi-storey in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.

Early life Anita Georgina Edith Studdy was born about 1871 in England to Captain Henry Studdy who was a Captain the Royal Navy. She was married twice. Her first husband was Captain David Longfield Beatty. They were married on 9 January 1899 and later lived in Borodale, County Wexford, Ireland. She was his second wife. They had a son Flight Lieutenant Henry Longfield Beatty, born while they were living in Warwickshire, England on 4 March 1901. Her son died in a flying boat accident on 15 Feb 1935. Her first husband died on 4 April 1904. Career Lett was a believer that the government was not the best organisation to take control of issues like the feeding of children in school. However she was also not prepared to sit back and watch children go hungry. Lett believed, as did the organisation she helped to create, that a woman's place was in activism and the public sphere especially in areas like the Poor Law Guardians and local elected officials responsible for women's work and children's welfare. The formation of the United Irishwomen began in 1908 and it took two years until the first formal meetings occurred. At the first meeting Lett discussed the importance of healthcare, education, fashion, horticulture, the rearing of children and the dullness of rural Ireland. The organisation held that women needed to be represented in government and their right to be elected to positions. With Lett's support the organisation was also instrumental in building clubs for women to play camogie. Lett was intent on women developing the role of women and the formation of a strong Irish identity. Supporting her belief in the value of games for girls, Lett was the trainer for the Davidstown/Bree camogie team which won the district final in 1913. Later family She married Harold Lett in Enniscorthy on 27 April 1909. They lived in Ballynapierce, Enniscorthy. She had a daughter, also Anita, on 22 January 1910 with her second husband. Harold Lett was the chairman of the local board of Guardians and a staunch loyalist. Lett died in 1940 of cirrhosis of the liver two years after her husband.

Its very first flights, starting April 23, 1942, however, were Lend-Lease deliveries of American-built aircraft to Great Britain and the Netherlands. The airline performed hundreds of missions delivering munitions and personnel; and supporting USO activities from 1942 to 1945, including transporting passengers such as Bob Hope, Joe E.

The airline operated land-based aircraft, as opposed to similar airlines operating flying boats, out of Hickam Field, Guam, Guadalcanal, Australia and New Guinea. During its peak in 1943, the airline had 800 employees and operated twice-weekly flights to the South West Pacific. Consairway was reported to have flown more than 101 million ton-miles of cargo and 299 million passenger miles by its closing in 1945. The airline flew the LB-30 Liberator II, Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber, as well as a converted XB-24B that was used as a luxury airliner for the United States Army Air Forces. In 1992, the civilian employees who had worked overseas for Consairway between December 14, 1941 and August 14, 1945 received status and benefits as military veterans under the Veterans Benefits Administration.

The first modern Catholics came to Kazan in the eighteenth century and were mainly of German origin. In 1835, the first parish was founded by Polish priests, and its parishioners gathered in private homes or temporary structures. The Catholic population, mostly of Polish origin, increased steadily, and the city of Kazan ultimately granted permission to build the church in 1855. Permission to build the church came with the conditions that the church would not stand out from the surrounding buildings and would not display a strong traditional Roman Catholic architectural character. Kazan's Catholic parish dispersed during the era of communism and was reconvened in 1995, but the church was not returned to the Catholic community. Officials of the city instead authorized the use of a small chapel located in one of the city's cemeteries. Once restored, the chapel was consecrated by Bishop Pickel in 1998. A few years later, due to the removal of the wind tunnel from the old church, city authorities decided to allocate land in the center of Kazan to the Catholic community. Construction of the new church began in 2005 and took three years to complete. On 29 August 2008, the new church was consecrated during a ceremony led by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Angelo Sodano, in the presence of the Bishop Clemens Pickel, the Apostolic Nuncio Antonio Mennini, and other leaders.

Along with the mass (known or predicted) of a body, the weight is calculated. Normal gravity The acceleration due to gravity depends on the gravity of the mass, which rests inside of the object. The gravity decreases at longer distance between centers of mass. The acceleration due to gravity furthermore is influenced by the rotation of the earth. As centrifugal force increases at longer earth's axis distance, thus centrifugal force is highest at the equator and lowest the poles. The formulas for calculating the normal gravity is based on the assumption of an imagined rotationally symmetrical ellipsoid model of the earth, the surface of which is identical to an equipotential surface.

With GRS 80 the following series expansion is also introduced: :\\\\gamma_0(\\\\varphi) = \\\\gamma_a \\\\cdot (1 + c_1 \\\\cdot \\\\sin^2 \\\\varphi + c_2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin^4 \\\\varphi + c_3 \\\\cdot \\\\sin^6 \\\\varphi + c_4 \\\\cdot \\\\sin^8\\\\varphi + \\\\dots) As such the parameters are: * c1 = 5.279 0414¬∑10‚àí3 * c2 = 2.327 18¬∑10‚àí5 * c3 = 1.262¬∑10‚àí7 * c4 = 7¬∑10‚àí10 The accuracy is at about ¬±10‚àí9 m/s2 exact. When the exactness is not required, the terms at further back can be omitted. But it is recommended to use this finalized formula.  Height dependence  Cassinis determined the height dependence, as: : g(\\\\varphi, h) = g_0(\\\\varphi) - \\\\left( 3{.}08 \\\\cdot 10^{-6} \\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{s}^2} - 4{.}19 \\\\cdot 10^{-7} \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{cm}^3}{\\\\mathrm{g}\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{s}^2} \\\\cdot \\\\rho \\\\right) \\\\cdot h The average rock density œÅ is no longer considered. Since GRS 1967 the dependence on the ellipsoidal elevation h is: :\\\\begin{align} g(\\\\varphi, h) & = g_0(\\\\varphi) - \\\\left( 1 - 1{.}39 \\\\cdot 10^{-3} \\\\cdot \\\\sin^2(\\\\varphi) \\\\right) \\\\cdot 3{.}0877 \\\\cdot 10^{-6} \\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{s}^2} \\\\cdot h + 7{.}2 \\\\cdot 10^{-13} \\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{m} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{s}^2} \\\\cdot h^2 & = g_0(\\\\varphi) - \\\\left( 3{.}0877 \\\\cdot 10^{-6} - 4{.}3 \\\\cdot 10^{-9} \\\\cdot \\\\sin^2(\\\\varphi) \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{s}^2} \\\\cdot h + 7{.}2 \\\\cdot 10^{-13} \\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{m} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{s}^2} \\\\cdot h^2 \\\\end{align} Another expression is: :g(\\\\varphi,h) = g_0(\\\\varphi) \\\\cdot (1 - (k_1 - k_2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin^2 \\\\varphi) \\\\cdot h + k_3 \\\\cdot h^2) with the parameters derived from GSR80: * k_1 = 2 \\\\cdot (1 + f + m) / a = 3{.}157\\\\,04\\\\cdot10^{-7} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{m^{-1}} * k_2 = 4 \\\\cdot f / a = 2{.}102\\\\,69\\\\cdot10^{-9} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{m^{-1}} * k_3 = 3 / (a^2) = 7{.}374\\\\,52\\\\cdot10^{-14} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{m^{-2}} This adjustment is about right for common heights in Aviation; But for heights up to outer space (over ca. 100 kilometers) it is out of range.  WELMEC formula  In all German standards offices the free-fall acceleration g is calculated in respect to the average latitude œÜ and the average height above sea level h with the WELMEC‚ÄìFormel: :g(\\\\varphi, h) = \\\\left( 1 + 0{.}0053024 \\\\cdot \\\\sin^2(\\\\varphi) - 0{.}0000058 \\\\cdot \\\\sin^2(2 \\\\varphi) \\\\right) \\\\cdot 9{.}780318 \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{m}}{\\\\mathrm{s}^2} - 0{.}000003085 \\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{s}^2} \\\\cdot h The formula is based on the International gravity formula from 1967\\\\. The scale of free-fall acceleration at a certain place must be determined with precision measurement of several mechanical magnitudes. Weighing scales, the mass of which does measurement because of the weight, relies on the free-fall acceleration, thus for use they must be prepared with different constants in different places of use. Through the concept of so-called gravity zones, which are divided with the use of normal gravity, a weighing scale can be calibrated by the manufacturer before use. 700kB  Example  Free-fall acceleration in Schweinfurt: Data: * Latitude: 50¬∞ 3‚Ä≤ 24‚Ä≥ = 50.0567¬∞ * Height above sea level: 229.7 m * Density of the rock plates: ca. 2.6 g/cm¬≥ * Measured free-fall acceleration: g = 9.8100 ¬± 0.0001 m/s¬≤ Free-fall acceleration, calculated through normal gravity formulas: * Cassinis: g = 9.81038 m/s¬≤ * Jeffreys: g = 9.81027 m/s¬≤ * WELMEC: g = 9.81004 m/s¬≤  Books  * Wolfgang Torge: Geod√§sie. 2.

In 2011, she was selected by the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s as one of the 100 most influential Latino personalities. Her novels prominently feature themes of queerness while the topics of her songs range from Dominican social issues to divergent sexuality. Rita Indiana is highly recognized and awarded among the Caribbean literary scene and her viral music success has made Indiana a household name in the Dominican Republic where she is popularly referred to as \\"La Monstra\\" (the monster). Early Life and education Born in Santo Domingo in 1977, Rita Indiana is the grand-niece of the soprano Ivonne Haza and great-great-great-granddaughter of the poet and hero of the Restoration War, Manuel Rodr√≠guez Obj√≠o. She is also second cousin of the journalist √ìscar Haza and of the politician V√≠ctor Bison√≥. She was baptized in honor of her great-grandmother Rita Indiana del Castillo y Rodr√≠guez-Obj√≠o. Rita Indiana attended El Colegio Calasanz in Costa Rica, where her father has established a business. After finishing her schooling in Costa Rica, Rita Indiana continued her education in the Dominican Republic at Autonomous University in her birth city of Santo Domingo where she studied Art History. However, she left this course a year after admittance. Rita Indiana then attended Altos de Chavon School of Design but once again left her schooling and decided to pursue a career in writing.  Literary career  Rita Indiana admits to having a passion for reading and writing from a young age. The piece of literature to first spark her interest in literature was Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. She credits her style of writing for the marginalized youth to Mark Twain's similar subject matter. Rita Indiana began her writing career with short stories in the mid 1990s, shortly after leaving Autonomous University. At the age of eighteen, Rita Indiana published her first short stories in the only literary magazine in the Dominican Republic at the time. After leaving Altos de Chavon School of Design, she was able to write and publish her first novel La Estrategia de Chochueca in 2000. La Estrategia de Chochueca belongs to her trilogy La trilog√≠a de ni√±as locas, which also include Papi (2005), and Nombres y Animales (2013). These are peppered with Dominican slang and colloquialisms and center around exploring the social issues present in the Dominican Republic. This trilogy also introduced themes of nonconforming sexual identity not previously highlighted in Dominican Literature. Her early work is highly regarded for its authentic portrayal of Caribbean life and is now studied in literature courses across the United States and the Caribbean. Rita Indiana later explored the genre of science fiction with her novel La mucama de Omicunl√© (2017). She made this shift to science fiction after noticing the drastic differences in technological and social development across the Caribbean. Rita Indiana also finds that this genre lends itself to more critical social and political commentary that she has previously not been able to access in past pieces. La mucama de Omicunl√© became the first Spanish-language work to receive the Grand Prize of the Association of Caribbean Writers. In 2019, the same book, translated to English, was published as Tentacle. Her sixth novel, Made in Saturn, will be published by And Other Stories in 2020.  Music career  alt= Rita Indiana moved to Puerto Rico in the mid 2000s and began exploring the realm of music despite never taking music lessons or showing much interest in the music industry. Eventually, she produced the single \\"Altar Epandex in duo with Miti Miti\\" after discovering her ear for creating electro-meringue beats on music computer software. This single was very well received and was chosen by New York City's Daily News as one of the top 5 indie jewels of 2008. Rita Indiana's sound is heavily inspired by Dominican popular music, including meringue and salsa . She is often credited with reinventing merengue dancing through her compositions and interpretations of Afro-Caribbean rhythms and electric beats. In 2009, Rita Indiana banded with a group known as Los Misterios and together they went on to release several more singles along with a complete album titled El Juidero in 2010. This album married the sounds of analog and digital music and reached viral success across several online plat forms. Rita India y Los Misterios have become popularly followed both by people in the Dominican Republic and beyond. The subject of their music frequently feature themes of culture and sexual identity as well as social issues of the Caribbean. One of their most popular singles \\"La hora de volv√©,\\" comments on the frequent immigration of Dominicans to the United States. The songs speaks about the hardships these individuals face in the Dominican as well as the hardships they experience in the United States. It is now seen as an anthem by Dominicans all over the world as its lyrics inspire listeners to value their roots and calls on them to return home. At the height of their success, Rita Indiana y Los Misterios played at many sold-out venues, including Santo Domingo Hard Rock Caf√©. The group was also nominated for the Casandra prize in the category \\"Revelation of the Year\\" in 2010. With her band, Indiana appeared at the celebrated venue SOB's in New York and NPR included her El Juidero in their list \\"Top 10 Latin American Albums of 2010\\". She was given the nickname \\"La Monstra,\\" translated to \\"the monster.\\" Indiana released her most latest single in 2017 called \\"El Castigador\\" after going on a hiatus for several years. Indiana's primary focus is on her literary career than creating music. She admitted that she disliked the \\"pop fame,\\" and she wanted to walk the streets without being recognized everywhere she goes. Rita Indiana also appreciated the autonomy and independence of writing whereas producing music required extensive collaboration. She has stated that she feels comfortable with her decision to leave the pop music industry where her career felt as if it happened somewhat by accident. However, she continued to produce music for other artists and musicians. Rita Indiana has written songs for influential Latin American musicians Julieta Venegas and Calle 13.  Personal life and influence  At the 2010 Cassandra Awards in 2010, Rita Indiana attended the prestigious event with her partner Noelia Quintero, whom she held hands with and kissed throughout that evening. Rita Indiana was met with public backlash and criticism. Many media outlets expressed disapproval of the pair's public display of affection and labeled this event as Indiana's official public outing. However, Rita Indiana's musical and literary career seemed to be unaffected by the controversies and she continued to discuss both her sexuality and her relationship openly with the public. Through her work and her interviews, Indiana has established her stance against the social norms surrounding sexual and gender identity in the Caribbean. Aware of the ambiguity of her appearance, the writer rejects the notion of labels and expresses her discomfort with the pressure of these norms and says, \\"Labels exist because they have a function. . . I‚Äôve been dealing with labels all my life: Tomboy, headbanger, weirdo or lesbian, underground, celebrity. Labels are caricatures.\\"Alamo, Hector Luis (2013-12-22). \\"Interview: Rita Indiana Hern√°ndez\\". Gozamos. Retrieved 2019-10-05. Because of her vocal ideas on queerness, Rita Indiana has become a key advocate of the queer community in the Caribbean and continues to use her work to create a space in which a heterogeneous, multiple and complex Caribbean reality is reflected.Hutchinson, Sydney. \\"Listening Sideways: The Transgenre Work of Rita Indiana.\\" Tigers of a Different Stripe: Performing Gender in Dominican Music. : University of Chicago Press, May 18, 2017. University Press Scholarship Online. Date Accessed 4 Oct. 2019 Though Indiana is not publicly involved in queer politics, by representing the queer community in her work, Indiana uses her musical and literary influence to act as a cultural counter-strategy against homophobia and gender oppression seen in the Caribbean.

On 19 May 2014, at the age of seventeen, Qureshi was attacked with sulfuric acid by her estranged brother-in-law and two other assailants when she was traveling to the city of Allahabad for an Alim exam. The attack was actually aimed at her sister Gulshan, but Qureshi was mistaken for her. While the two other assailants were never captured after the attack, her brother-in-law was arrested. After the attack, she felt suicidal for a short period of time as she was left scarred on her face and arms and lost one of her eyes completely. After healing, Qureshi became the face of the Make Love Not Scars campaign, which aims to give \\"a voice to those who have been assaulted\\" by acid attacks and campaigns for the end of the sale of acid in India. She also began making beauty tutorials online as a way to campaign against the sale of acid. Cosmopolitan called the videos \\"ridiculously empowering\\". In an interview with India New England News in September 2017, Qureshi was asked if she had heard from her attacker. She stated, \\"I haven‚Äôt spoken to the attacker or his family as such, but I met him two months back in court. I instinctively wanted to rip his throat out, to be honest‚Ä¶ When he saw me, he told his lawyer and people, \\"She has become so big and a model, she is in a good place, so please release me or help me out.\\"\\" Modeling Qureshi is the face of the Make Love Not Scars campaign in India.

Qureshi's makeup was done by Chika Chan and her hair by Aubrey Loots. Of the experience, Qureshi stated, \\"This walk was important to me because there are so many girls like me who are survivors of acid attacks, and this will give them courage. And it will also go to show people who judge people based on their appearance that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover - you should look at everyone though the same eyes.\\" Also at the 2016 NYFW she walked for Vaishali Couture.

History In the years following the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the first partition of Poland in the eighteenth century, a significant number of Catholics went to populate the vast lands around the Urals. Many came to Perm in Siberia. Later, after the many Polish uprisings in the nineteenth century, thousands of Poles were sent to Siberia and the Urals. Since 1837 there was a small Catholic parish in Perm, which was then a large village. The Catholic community was 1,800 people in 1869.

G. Lamson and Company of Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. 1000 Palmer carbines were delivered to Union forces in the American Civil War one month after the war ended. All rifles (designed to be carbines for cavalry soldiers) were subsequently sold to civilians after the war. The rifle was the first bolt action rifle to be accepted for use by the US Army Ordnance Department. Unlike traditional bolt actions which contain the firing pin centered in the bolt, the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the bolt in place via a short stubby handle. The hammer of the weapon (located on the right side of the receiver like all other percussion fired rifles of the time period) holds the firing pin at the tip. A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single shot action, the cartridges were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, ram rod and percussion cap which consumed time during loading procedures. The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the breach of the gun in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled. Ultimately the actions of rifles like the Spencer rifle and the Sharps rifle were preferred over the Palmer. Its unique significant design is a predecessor of all modern bolt action type rifles.

It dates to the Qing Dynasty and is honoured as one of Zhangzhou's \\"Three Precious Treasures\\". In 1983, its recipe was guarded as \\"top secret\\" by the Chinese Ministry of Light Industry. Babao seal paste was added to the National Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2008 and the China Time-honored Brand list by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in 2011. Characteristics Babao seal paste is made from eight precious materials: musk, pearl, rhesus macaque bezoar, agate, coral, gold, borneolum and amber. These ingredients are ground into a powder, with additional materials, before processing by a secret technique. The finished product is available in six grades. Babao seal paste is characterized by its bright color and good aroma. It is also fire and water-resistant. Three main traditional studios make seal paste in Zhangzhou: Xiling Seal Art Society in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province; Rongbaozhai in Beijing; and Babao Workshop in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province. They rank it top among other seal paste brands in China. History Babao seal paste originated in 1673 during the Qing Dynasty. Zhangzhou Yuanfeng Drugstore owner Wei Chang‚Äôan (Chinese: È≠èÈïøÂÆâ) combined the eight ingredients of the paste to make an ointment he called Babao. Due to its high cost, the ointment was not widely used at that time. After using the ointment on his art and discovering its impressive color, Changan repurposed the mixture as Babao seal paste. In 1746, local government official Si Da gave Babao seal paste a name called Lihua Workshop. The paste was sent to the royal palace as a tribute, and the Qianlong Emperor often bestowed it on his ministers. Royal favor helped popularize Babao seal paste in Chinese culture. Babao seal paste won a special award at the 1910 Nanyang Commodity Exposition and won the first prize at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, the paste was sent to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a national present.

Personal life Marco \\"Mcoy\\" Fundales was born on November 3, 1977 in Baliuag, Bulacan. Fundales attended Mariano Ponce High School in Bulacan in 1990s where he met Clem Castro. The two later formed Orange and Lemons in late '90s. He is an Eagle Scout of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines and a Ten Outstanding Boy Scouts of the Philippines Awardee. Fundales is also an actor and he was one of the participant of ABS-CBN reality show, Pinoy Big Brother Celebrity Edition Season 2. Fundales is currently the writer for Pepito Manaloto. His musical influences are the bands like The Smiths, Eraserheads and The Beatles. Orange and Lemons (1999-2007) Orange & Lemons were officially formed in 1999. The band originally consisted of Mcoy Fundales on vocals, Clem Castro on guitars, Law Santiago on bass and Michael Salvador on drums. The band started doing cover songs from their influenced artists, The Beatles and The Smiths. The band were managed by Bong Baluyot. Sometime in early 2000s Mcoy Fundales and Clem Castro met brothers Ace and JM del Mundo in a local bar in Bulacan. The two replaced original members Law Santiago and Michael Salvador who left the group and filled the full-time duties for bass and drums.

Orange and Lemons came up with a song called \\"Pinoy Ako\\". Kenyo and solo activities (2007-present) After weeks of speculation, it was reported on October 10, 2007 by Inquirer News that Orange and Lemons had disbanded. The reason stated was primarily due to differences between band members and their managers. The three remaining members later formed a new band called Kenyo. The band released their debut album, Radiosurfing, in 2008. On May 24, 2014, it was announced that Fundales would be taking part in the third Philippine Popular Music Festival interpreting the song \\"Kung Aking Ang Langit\\" alongside singer Clara Benin, daughter of former Side A bassist Joey Benin.

Biography Born and raised in Dublin Ireland, Mary Manning got her theatre training in Sara Allgood's teaching class in the Abbey Theatre. She had gone to school in Morehampton House and Alexandra College, Dublin. She also worked as a writer for the Gate Theatre. She adapted the novel Guests of the Nation for a film directed by Denis Johnston. Manning also helped found the Dublin Film Society in 1930. She worked as a film critic and co-founded the Gate Theatre arts magazine Motley in 1932. In 1935 Manning moved to Boston where she married Harvard Law School professor Mark De Wolfe Howe. They had three daughters Fanny, Susan and Helen. When her husband died Manning returned to Dublin in 1967 and lived in Monkstown, County Dublin for another ten years. During this time Manning wrote for various publications such as Hibernia, The Irish Times. She later returned to live in Cambridge. Manning was a founder of the Poets' Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts and worked as drama director at Radcliffe College during World War II. After Manning returned to the US she married Faneuil Adams of Boston, Massachusetts in 1980 Mary's death occurred on 27 June in the year of 1999; at the age of 93 years old. Her death place was at the Mt Auburn hospital located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Irelands Two Waves of Silent Film  From 1914 to 1926, Ireland experienced a surge of new film styles being produced, consisting of historical melodramas and romantic comedies. Following this, 1930 to 1935 birthed a second wave of industry produced silent films that were intended to be less cliche compared to the first wave. The films produced under the second wave were much more experimental and dealt less with the commercial appeals of the first wave. There's minimal information on how Manning specifically contributed to the second wave, however, it is stated that she played an important role producing five out of the six films to come out of that wave. Prior to her career as a writer and filmmaker, Mary Manning worked as a film critic throughout the 1920s and 30s. She worked as a film critic for the Irish Statesmen for a year during that time until it went out of business. She was known to disapprove of Hollywood's \\"unimaginable stories and its stereotypical portrayal of Ireland and the Irish\\".  Bibliography  = Writings = * Adams, Bernard. Denis Johnston: A Life.

This landing party was able to escape being taken as prisoners of war, in November 1914, after their ship was destroyed in a battle with the Australian light cruiser . History Direction Island; the three-masted Ayesha is visible in the background The Ayesha was a 30 metre long, 7.5 metre wide three-masted topsail schooner of 97 gross Register Tonnage. It originally served as a supply vessel in the British occupation of the Cocos as well as a transport for copra to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. At that time the crew consisted of one captain and five men. Because of the operation of a steamer connection in the area, the ship was no longer used and was dismantled in the port of Port Refuge, Direction Island. On 9 November 1914, a landing party of the German Imperial Navy's light cruiser Emden was on the island to attack the local cable and radio station. At this time their ship was attacked by the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney. During the battle, Emden was beached and set on fire. The remainder of the crew, not already onshore, was captured or died. To escape from the island, the landing party under the command of Lieutenant Hellmuth von M√ºcke seized possession of the Ayesha. The crew now consisted of three officers, six sergeants, and 38 sailors. SMS Ayesha before Hodeida in January 1915. Painting by Willy St√∂wer 1915 In fact, the Ayesha had previously been scuttled weeks before in the Indian Ocean, and the Emden landing party was transported on the steamship Choising. The picture was probably no longer published after 1916. The British personnel of the radio station provided M√ºcke with food to take on the ship. The Ayesha was in bad shape, with the seals of the seacocks having been removed, and the bilge pumps not working properly, it was constantly taking on water. The wood of this confiscated sailing ship was very rotten and leaking. The four drinking water tanks could not be cleaned, and the water in three of them was contaminated. The hold was loaded with 2,000 rounds of ammunition, 29 Mauser model 88 and 98 rifles, each with 60 rounds and 24 pistols. Thus equipped, the crew escaped being captured by HMAS Sydney. Despite these shortcomings, the Ayesha reached Padang on the west coast of Sumatra on 27 November. Since this was a Dutch port, and due to neutrality provisions, the Ayesha had to leave within 24 hours, since she was now a vessel of the German Imperial Navy. During the time in Padang, M√ºcke succeeded in meeting with the German Consul, where he was slipped a note with the coordinates for a meeting with a German merchant ship. After leaving Padang, the Ayesha met the North German Lloyd steamer, Choising, on 14 December. The crew moved on to the steamer, and Ayesha was scuttled on 16 December 1914 at 16:58 hours, after a 1709 mile trip. After scuttling the Ayesha, the crew was taken to Arabia to begin an overland trek that ended in Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire in May 1915. From there, the crew was able to return to Germany.Dr. Emil Ludwig, The Berlinger Tageblatt, 25 May 1915.

Twelve bodies and a few artefacts were later recovered, but the rest of the victims and the main body of the wreck were never found. Built in 1941, after ending its naval service in 1957 Darlwyne was used as a private cabin cruiser, first on the River Thames and later in Cornwall, where it became a commercial passenger boat, despite being unlicensed for such work. It underwent considerable structural modifications, including the removal of its original watertight bulkheads and the conversion of its aft cabin into a large open cockpit. These changes adversely affected its seaworthiness. Surveyors' reports in 1964 and 1966 indicated that Darlwyne was unfit for the open sea; furthermore, it carried no radio or distress flares, and its lifesaving aids were rudimentary. By 1966 Darlwyne was in the ownership of John Barratt of Penryn in Cornwall. The fatal voyage was arranged when the boat's skipper, Brian Bown, agreed to take a group of guests from the Greatwood guest house in Mylor on a sea trip to Fowey. On the morning of 31 July the outward voyage was completed without mishap, but the weather subsequently deteriorated. Bown disregarded advice to remain in Fowey harbour, and shortly after 4:00 pm began the return trip to Mylor. An unconfirmed sighting at around 6:00 pm placed the boat, in worsening conditions, in the vicinity of Dodman Point, a prominent coastal feature. Following its failure to arrive at Mylor the alarm was raised early on 1 August, and full air and sea searches began at dawn. After the recovery of 12 bodies, searches continued intermittently for several months, without finding traces of the vessel. A Board of Trade enquiry into Darlwynes loss placed the main blame on Barratt and Bown for allowing the vessel to go to sea in an unsafe and unprepared condition. Bown was lost in the disaster; Barratt was censured and ordered to contribute ¬£500 to the cost of the enquiry. The Board's report exposed the laxity with which boat licensing regulations were being administered, and led to stiffer penalties for non-compliance, but there were no immediate regulatory changes, and no criminal proceedings were recommended. In April 1967 a memorial screen, listing the names of the 31 dead, was dedicated in Mylor church at a special service led by the Bishop of Truro. In 2016, on the 50th anniversary of the sinking, divers found an anchor and other debris at a location close to Dodman Point, which they stated were in all probability Darlwyne relics. Vessel history =Construction= Picket boat no. 41768, the future Darlwyne, was built for the Royal Navy in 1941 in the Sussex Yacht Works yard at Shoreham-by-Sea. The hull, carvel built from African mahogany and rock elm, was long, approximately wide, with a draught at the stern of . Bulkheads divided the hull into fully watertight compartments, each equipped with a bilge pump. The vessel's original engine power was provided by twin Gardner 6LW diesel engines, each developing 95 horsepower. It was built to operate in harbours and estuaries, mainly in transferring personnel between ship and shore, rather than for the open sea. =1941‚Äì1964= The vessel remained with the Royal Navy until 1957, when it was sold to the Belsize Boatyard in Southampton. Here, it was converted to a cabin cruiser, during which most of the original bulkheads were removed; the replacements were not watertight. In September 1959 the boatyard sold the boat to joint owners Messrs Lowe and Gray, who replaced the engines with less powerful twin Perkins P6 units each generating 65 hp. They then moved the boat to Teddington on the Thames, where on 22 April 1960 it was registered as a river cruiser under the name Darlwyne. At this time its gross register tonnage was recorded as 12.35. General view of Falmouth Harbour In October 1962 the owners transferred Darlwyne to St Mawes, in Falmouth Harbour, Cornwall. It was taken there by a crew of six; although the sea trip was accomplished without any serious incident, the crew were critical of the boat's performance in certain weather conditions. They found it top-heavy, difficult to steer, and with a tendency to list. Darlwyne remained at St Mawes until September 1963, when the owners decided to sell it as a potential commercial passenger boat. At Mylor, in the Carrick Roads estuary of the River Fal, it was inspected by a local marine surveyor, George Corke. He noted the poor steering‚Äîit was impossible, he said, to navigate a straight course‚Äîand thought that much work would be necessary before it was fit for passenger-carrying operations. On 30 May 1964 Corke acted as agent for Lowe and Gray in the sale of Darlwyne to John Barratt of Penryn, whose main objective was to renovate the vessel with a view to a profitable sale. =In Cornwall= After extensive work and repainting, in September 1965 Barratt agreed to sell Darlwyne to Steven Gifford, who took possession and began further adaptations. The sale ultimately fell through, and by the end of the year the vessel had been returned to Barratt. In the spring and early summer of 1966, under the supervision of Barratt's daughter, further substantial alterations were carried out, including the removal of the aft cabin to create an open cockpit area. This work, undertaken without professional advice, was never fully completed. During this period the boat was in regular use for trips by members of the Barratt family, including a Whitsuntide voyage across Falmouth Bay to the Helford River, where it apparently performed well in strong winds. At the beginning of July 1966, Darlwyne made several commercial sightseeing trips around Falmouth Harbour during Falmouth's Tall Ships regatta. A passenger on one of these sorties was Brian Michael Bown, a former member of the RAF Marine Rescue Section. Although not formally qualified as a ship's master, Bown had sailing experience and had skippered boats on seagoing trips to Fowey and the Isles of Scilly. Subsequently, Bown suggested to Barratt a business venture in which Darlwyne would be used as a day-trip boat. Bown's letters indicate that he was proposing to work as the boat's skipper, and to take a third share of the profits. Barratt's daughter advised Bown that they were preparing Darlwyne as \\"a twelve-passenger charter boat\\"; any number in excess of 12 would mean conforming with tougher Board of Trade regulations, and licensing might prove difficult. According to Barratt, Bown was to assume responsibility for obtaining whatever licences were necessary. Barratt later claimed that Bown had bought the boat outright, but there is no documentation of this supposed purchase, nor did Barratt mention it to anyone else. On 20 July 1966, at the request of Barratt's daughter, Darlwyne was again examined by George Corke, who found the boat in generally poor condition. Among the faults he listed were dry rot, a weakening of the hull caused by the removal of various supporting frames, and signs that the hull had been \\"pushed in\\" below the waterline. Corke's report reiterated his earlier view that Darlwyne was presently unfit for work in the open sea. This report was sent not to Barratt but to the family's solicitors, where in the days that followed it lay unread; there is no indication that Barratt was aware of its contents before 31 July. Disaster =Plans= Boathouses at Greatwood, photographed in 2009. The former guest house can be seen among the trees Robert Rainbird, proprietor of the Greatwood guest house at Mylor Creek, near Falmouth, was familiar with Darlwyne, having cruised with Bown in one of the earlier Tall Ships sailings. According to his later account, when two of his guests asked him about the possibility of organising a sea excursion, he put them in touch with Bown. On the evening of Saturday 30 July, amid celebrations following England's victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, Bown and his friend Jeffrey Stock, a qualified engineer, visited Greatwood. They found that enthusiasm for a sea trip had spread to many of the guests, and an agreement was made to take a large party to Fowey the following day. Different accounts were given later of the financial basis for the proposed hire ‚Äì whether it was to be a fixed charge or a rate per head is uncertain. Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed ignorance of the arrangements made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the harbourmaster, who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III Passenger Certificate from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator and a range of safety devices. Darlwyne had no radio, no distress flares, and carried only two lifebelts. Bown had apparently begun enquiries with the Falmouth Harbour Commission, but neither he nor Darlwyne possessed any of the licences needed for the boat to operate commercially. =Voyage, 31 July 1966= Map showing the key locations in Darlwynes final journey In accordance with the arrangement made the previous day, early on Sunday 31 July Bown and Stock brought Darlwyne to Mylor Creek. The Greatwood party comprised, in all, twenty-six guests, one member of staff on her day off, and two children of another staff member. Eight of the party were children. Darlwyne anchored offshore, and the passengers were rowed out in two dinghies, one of which was hauled aboard and stored on davits, the other attached by a painter to Darlwynes stern. BBC weather forecasts for the Cornwall area, broadcast the previous evening and earlier that morning, were discouraging; all promised increasing winds, up to Force 7, with the probability of rain from midday. Such weather conditions could produce heavy seas and poor visibility. Nevertheless, Darlwyne set out from Mylor shortly after 10:00 am in pleasant sunshine, expecting to return before 7:00 pm. The journey to Fowey, which included a slight detour to view Mevagissey harbour, was completed without incident, and the party arrived in Fowey just after 1:00 pm. By this time the weather had deteriorated, and it was raining heavily. Bown did not tie up to the main town quay ‚Äì he was heard saying that the vessel was \\"a bitch to handle\\" ‚Äì and anchored mid-harbour, again using the dinghies to land the party. After three hours in the town, the group reassembled at the quay to be ferried back to Darlwyne. The wind was rising; a bystander heard a local fisherman advise Bown not to leave the harbour until the weather improved, but the warning was brushed aside. Darlwyne sailed at approximately 4:10 pm, and headed westward into the worsening weather. For the first few miles the large headland known as Dodman Point would provide some shelter; thereafter the vessel would be fully exposed to the force of the winds. Dodman Point There were several possible sightings of Darlwyne on its homeward voyage. Outside Fowey Harbour in the vicinity of the Cannis Buoy a fisherman watched a vessel towing a dinghy pass by; soon afterwards another fisherman saw a boat off Meanease Point, close to Dodman Point, but did not notice a dinghy being towed astern. At about 5:45 pm a farmer whose land overlooked the sea to the west of Dodman Point saw a launch running close to Hemmick Beach, moving westward. He could see people in the stern area, and there were no evident signs of distress. A short while later an observer in the village of Portloe saw a cabin cruiser somewhere between Dodman Point and Nare Head, moving in the direction of Falmouth. This was the last recorded possible sighting. By this time winds had strengthened to Force 6, with waves reaching amid increasing rain and flying spray. In the late afternoon a holidaymaker reported seeing four people apparently stranded on Diamond Rock, a semi-submerged reef off Porthluney Cove, west of Dodman Point. The police were informed, but at that time Darlwyne was not overdue, and thus there was no reason to connect these people with those on the boat. This incident was not referred to in the subsequent searches, nor in the later Board of Trade enquiry which fixed the most likely time of sinking much later in the evening. =Raising the alarm= At around 7:00 pm, Barratt's son-in-law Christopher Mitchell noticed that Darlwyne had not returned to its Penryn moorings. Having ascertained that the vessel was not at Greatwood House, Mitchell asked for news at the Falmouth coastguard station shortly before 7:30. The duty coastguard, Seagar, had no record of Darlwynes departure that morning, and was unaware of its whereabouts. At this time there was no particular cause for alarm, and Seager did not record the enquiry. Mitchell assumed the boat might be sheltering in a harbour or estuary, but further enquiries among local acquaintances brought no further information. Later that evening, Rainbird telephoned Seagar and expressed concern at Darlwynes non-arrival. As the call was not recorded, its timing is uncertain; it may have been around 8:00, but possibly as late as 9:30. Seager advised Rainbird to contact the coastguard stations on the Fowey‚ÄìFalmouth route for news of Darlwyne, and asked him to report back any information. From his enquiries Rainbird established from the Polruan station that Darlwyne had left Fowey shortly after 4:00pm that afternoon. He later claimed that he had passed this information to the Falmouth coastguards at about 10:15 pm. Seager denied receiving any such call before his duty stint ended at 11:00 pm, and did not mention the concerns about the missing Darlwyne to Coastguard Beard, his relief. Beard heard of the likely emergency for the first time at 2:45 am on Monday 1 August when Rainbird, by now seriously worried, rang the coastguard station. Beard then informed his district officer, who authorised a full-scale coastal search for the missing vessel to begin at daybreak. =Searches= Eddystone Lighthouse, off the Cornish coast At 5:34 am on Monday 1 August a warning message to shipping in the area was broadcast by the BBC. At 5:37 the Falmouth lifeboat was launched, followed a few minutes later by the Fowey lifeboat. At 6:45 a coastguard helicopter began a coastal search between Fowey and Falmouth, covering a distance of five miles out to sea. It was joined at 9:45 by an Avro Shackleton aircraft supplied by the RAF Search and Rescue Force, which extended the search area further south, west and east. Later, two Royal Navy ships, and , participated in the sea search. At about 1:25pm the tanker Esso Caernarvon found the dinghy that had been towed by Darlwyne, about south of Dolman Point and about from the Eddystone Lighthouse. The dinghy, empty but undamaged, was picked up by an RAF launch and brought to Falmouth. Amid rising anxiety ashore, there was still hope that Darlwyne remained afloat. Barratt's daughter believed the vessel to be \\"completely seaworthy\\", while Rainbird surmised that it might have drifted southwards, out of fuel or with incapacitated engines, towards the Channel Islands. The coxswain of the Fowey lifeboat said, after 15 hours of searching, that \\"there was nothing to suggest that a boat had been wrecked out there\\". Others were more sceptical: Steve Gifford, who had briefly owned the boat, was appalled that 31 people were aboard a vessel that was simply not strong enough to meet the heavy seas it must have encountered, and thought it likely she would have broken up and sunk very quickly. This view was shared by Corke, the surveyor, who felt that Darlwyne was not seaworthy for the weather conditions that developed while it was at sea. Searches by helicopter, Shackleton aircraft and lifeboats continued on 2 August, but were called off around mid-day due to poor visibility and adverse weather conditions. At the insistence of Rainbird, who argued that there was as yet no direct evidence that Darlwyne had sunk, the searches were resumed that evening. They continued into the following day, when they were joined by three de Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft, privately hired by friends of one of the missing families. The Rapides covered a sea area of , extending to the Channel Islands, before returning to Cornwall on 4 August without finding any trace of the missing vessel. Darlwynes possible fate was raised in the House of Commons on 2 August when members, while expressing the hope that survivors would be found, were concerned about the apparent lack of enforcement of regulations that should have prevented an overloaded, unlicensed craft from putting out to sea. The following day, the Cornish MP Peter Bessell was highly critical of the delay in commencing the search until long after it was clear that Darlwyne was overdue. He cited \\"expert opinion\\" that the craft was in all probability still afloat, and described the search activity thus far as \\"totally inadequate\\". This allegation was strongly denied by the Air Force minister Merlyn Rees, who maintained that there had been no lack of urgency and that everything possible had been and was still being done. =Victims= Falmouth Quay, where the first recovered bodies were brought on 4 August 1966 On 4 August the first victims from Darlwyne were discovered in the sea about four miles east of Dodman Point. The bodies were of Albert Russell, his wife Margaret, and two teenage girls: Susan Tassell and Amanda Hicks. The first three were brought ashore by the Falmouth lifeboat, the fourth by the Fowey lifeboat. On 5 August the body of Jean Brock was found, wearing a lifebelt, six miles west of the Eddystone lighthouse. That same day, light wreckage‚Äîplanking from the on-board dinghy, an engine cover, a plastic ball and some sun tan lotion‚Äîwas found on a beach near Polperro. On 8 August two more bodies‚ÄîMargaret Wright and Susan Cowan‚Äîwere found about eight miles from the Eddystone Lighthouse. Patricia Russell and Eileen Tassell were found two days later, off Looe Island and the Mew Stone respectively. The body of nine-year-old Janice Mills was washed ashore at Whitsand Bay on 11 August, and that of her eleven-year-old brother David was discovered at Downderry Beach, between Fowey and Plymouth, on 13 August. The twelfth and final body to be recovered was of Arthur Mills, found in the sea about 10 miles south of Plymouth. The subsequent post-mortems established that all the victims had drowned in deep water, suggesting that they had gone down with the vessel rather than after struggling on the surface. An analysis of the times shown on various watches found on the victims suggested that the sinking had probably taken place around 9:00 pm on 31 July, and thus that Darlwyne was afloat for around three hours after the last tentative sighting. When the first bodies were brought into Falmouth by the local lifeboat, the quays were lined with hundreds of people who watched in silence as the victims were landed and taken away in hearses. All commercial activity in the harbour was suspended; the royal yacht , at anchor on a visit to the port, removed its ceremonial bunting and dipped the White Ensign as a mark of respect. The crowds returned to the harbour on 7 August for the town's annual lifeboat service; that year the occasion became a memorial service for Darlwynes lost party. In the days and weeks that followed, relatives and friends of the victims took the bodies for private burial and collected the abandoned belongings from Greatwood. The sea search for the Darlwyne wreck continued through the autumn and winter and into 1967, led by . This navy minesweeper, equipped with the latest sonar equipment, carried out exhaustive searches in the area around Dodman Point, thought to be the vessel's most likely resting place. Although more than 600 dives were carried out, no sign of Darlwyne was discovered. In December 1966 the navy storeship HMS Maxim investigated the seabed around Looe, after reports that a trawler had caught on an unidentified object and lost its nets. Board of Trade enquiry Old County Hall, Truro, venue of the Board of Trade enquiry The Board of Trade court of enquiry into the loss of the Darlwyne began at the Old County Hall, Truro on 13 December 1966. It sat until 6 January 1967, and published its findings in March of that year. It was unable to determine who was responsible for organising the fatal trip, as most of those involved had lost their lives in the disaster. Barratt claimed ignorance, and Rainbird denied any role in the matter beyond introducing Bown to the guests who had asked about a sea trip. In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary, the court assumed that details had probably been finalised in the Greatwood bar, between Bown and the two guests who had initiated the request. The court established that at the time of the disaster, neither Darlwyne nor Bown were licensed in terms of either Board of Trade or local regulations for passenger- carrying vessels. The court believed that both Barratt and Bown were broadly aware of licensing requirements, but had taken few or no practical steps towards compliance by 31 July. Evidence of Darlwynes history confirmed Barratt as its legal owner. The court noted the general state of the vessel and the various alterations that had been carried out, affecting its seaworthiness. In particular, the cockpit floor was not watertight and had inadequate scuppers, so that water entering the cockpit drained into the lower hull rather than back into the sea. Lacking watertight bulkheads, the hull would easily flood with any rapid ingress of water. The hull itself showed evidence of dry rot and other external damage. Poor communication between the various parties concerned with the vessel in the preceding months meant that these various shortcomings had been overlooked or ignored. Furthermore, the overloading of the vessel with 31 people meant that it lay low in the water, so that a modest heel of 30 degrees would allow water into the open cockpit. The court heard details of Darlwynes departure from Fowey, the prevailing weather conditions on 31 July, and the subsequent possible sightings. It thought it likely that some time after 6:00 pm the engines failed, leaving the vessel to drift helplessly. Without radio or flares, Bown would have been unable to signal its distress. From the evidence of the stopped watches and the pathologist's reports of death by drowning in deep water, the court decided that it was likely that, around 9:00 pm, Darlwyne had been overwhelmed by heavy seas. Because of its structural faults it had filled with water and sunk rapidly, taking the entire complement down. Different testimonies were given about the number and timing of phone calls to the Falmouth coastguard station on the evening of 31 July, giving rise to a view that searches could have begun earlier. The court strongly recommended that in future, all messages received by coastguard stations relating to vessels should be recorded and logged. It was, however, satisfied that all searches had been thoroughly carried out. It did not feel that the supposed delay in beginning the searches was significant, as there was no information available that would have justified action before 9:00 pm, by which time the disaster had in all probability already happened. In determining responsibility for Darlwynes loss, the court was \\"satisfied that the major cause of the disaster was the Darlwyne going on a voyage to sea when she was physically unfit to withstand the normal perils which she might expect to meet\\". Culpability was shared between Bown and Barratt, the former for taking passengers to sea in an unfit boat, the latter for failing to warn his \\"agent or servant\\" of the vessel's unfit state. Barratt was severely censured by the court, and ordered to pay ¬£500 towards the cost of the enquiry. Barratt considered the court's findings as related to him were \\"rather unfair\\", while Bown's widow defended her late husband as a competent and experienced skipper. Rainbird declared himself vindicated. Aftermath St Mylor church On 9 April 1967, at the parish church of St Mylor, the Bishop of Truro led a service of dedication for a memorial screen, erected in the church to commemorate the victims of the Darlwyne disaster. The screen, designed by John Phillips and fashioned from oak by local craftsmen, contains the names of all the lost 31. After the Board of Trade report was published, the coroner reopened the inquests, which had been adjourned pending any recommendations from the enquiry for criminal proceedings. No criminal responsibility was established; verdicts of death by misadventure were recorded in each case. The coroner expressed the wish that, as a result of the tragedy, regulations concerning licences would be much more strictly enforced. In this he echoed the Board of Trade report, which had stated that regulations relating to boat licensing \\"date from the Victorian era\\", and were wholly inadequate in modern conditions. The Falmouth harbourmaster had told the enquiry that, without further staff, it would be impossible to check all the boats in the harbour; furthermore, he said, the ¬£5 maximum fine for operating an unlicensed boat was not a deterrent. In Parliament on 15 March 1967 the trade minister Joseph Mallalieu said that he had no plans to introduce further legislation for the licensing of pleasure boats plying for hire, but proposed to increase the penalties for infringement of existing regulations. Although the tragedy was keenly felt in Cornwall, its national impact, given the heavy loss of life, was relatively small, perhaps because it occurred during the post World Cup euphoria when public attention and headlines were directed elsewhere. No clues to Darlwynes fate emerged for decades. In July 2016, divers working with a BBC documentary team investigating the tragedy examined seabed locations closer to Dodman Point than the original searches. According to local fishermen, debris had been recovered from this area in the 1980s, including a wooden transom bearing the name Darlwyne. After several searches that revealed nothing, the 2016 divers found artefacts including an anchor, a winch, items of ballast, and the remains of a davit. No other recent wrecks or disappearances had been recorded in the area. \\"Taking everything into account\\", the divers reported, \\"it‚Äôs likely that what we found was what was left of the Darlwyne\\". On this basis several media sources reported that the mystery had been solved.

It is in the Diocese of San Clemente a Saratov, and located at Kranstadtskaya 14. The church was begun in 1898 and was operating in 1903, although the finishing works continued for several more years. The church itself was built in the Gothic style, made of red brick, and richly decorated. Along with the church, a stone two-story house was built in which the Catholic charitable society, the library, and the abbot's quarters were located. History The history of the Roman Catholic church in Tambov begins after the suppression of the Polish uprising in 1863, when thousands of Catholic Poles were deported to the Tambov region, where many eventually settled down. In 1896, the collection of funds for construction was started, and on May 25, 1903, the first church service was held, although there were only temporary altars, and there were no images and banners. Construction was done by Teofil Svirchevsky. A few years later, the interior decoration and installation of the icons was completed. The cathedral was made in the Gothic style, unique not only for Tambov, but for the entire central Russia. A parish was established in the church and a Catholic priest was appointed, who was subordinate to the Metropolitan of Mogilev. In 1918, the first attempts were made to remove items from the church property. The library was closed at the beginning of the 1920s, the books were taken, and the priest, Casimir Verzhbitsky, was repressed. After 1935, the community of believers disintegrated, and the church was no longer used for worship. In the postwar period, an attempt was made to transfer the church organ to another room, but after dismantling it proved impossible to reassemble. The building was used as the Tambov Repair and Bearing Plant. During the operation of the building as a shop the bell towers were destroyed, the facade was disfigured, the basement was flooded, and the walls corroded by acid. It was not until 1996 that the reconstruction of the church began, on the funds raised in Poland. In 1998 the Mayor of Tambov, A. Ilyin, lit the Eternal Light in the church. By 1999, the restoration of the temple under the direction of the rector of the parish Josef Matis was complete. At Christmas 1998, daily worship services resumed in the Church of the Exaltation. In the grounds of the church there is a sculpture of Zurab Tsereteli \\"St. Nicholas the Wonderworker\\".

Her research was recognized with several awards including one from the Canadian Society for Bioengineering. Marcotte is currently the Director of the Ottawa Research and Development Centre located at the Central Experimental Farm in Canada. Biography Marcotte completed a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Laval University in 1985. After completing her master's degree in food engineering at the University of Alberta in 1988, she began her career with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) as a professional engineer at the Food Research and Development Centre located in St. Hyacinthe, Quebec. In 1999, Marcotte obtained her Ph.D. in food processing from McGill University where she studied the ohmic heating process of viscous liquids. Career Marcotte has worked at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada as a section head of food preservation technologies, a research scientist in Food Processing and Engineering, and an advisor to the Director General of the Food Safety and Quality National Science Program. As a scientist, Dr. Marcotte‚Äôs research interests included: *The development of tools for the characterization of thermophysical properties;Safe and Healthy Food: Harvesting the Science. 2010. Retrieved from https://secure.cifst.ca/default.asp?id=1215 *The use of modeling and optimization technique in order to describe the evolution of product safety and quality upon processing; and *The development and optimization of novel thermal processes and thermal dehydration processes. Under the Federal Partners in Technology Transfer (FPTT) program, Marcotte and her team at the Development Centre partnered with Atoka Cranberries to produce a unique two- step drying process for cranberries that has been commercially implemented in Quebec. The innovation utilizes osmosis, a natural process to partially dehydrate and sweeten the fruit in order to make them more palatable. This method may also be used on fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish. Among other developments Marcotte has worked on a prototype pilot oven for the optimization of baking and computer software to establish cooking-cooling cycle for meat products. From 2006 to 2007, Marcotte was President of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology. In 2009, Marcotte became the Science Director of the Eastern Cereal and Oilseed Research Centre (now the Ottawa Research and Development Centre) located in Ottawa, Ontario where she was responsible for corporate research on food and health. She is the Canadian representative of the International Association on Engineering and Foods (IAEF) and the International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST).Workshop Report: Reprodutive Strategies for Addressing Genetic Diversity in Canadian Cattle and Bison.

It was part of the Union of the Centre and Christian Democracy of Catalonia (UCiDCC) in the 1977 Spanish general election, but it later dissolved to merge into the Union of the Centre of Catalonia (UCC) in 1978. History The party was created in Barcelona by the initiative of young entrepreneurs and professionals linked to the Barcelona Economic Circle and the Jove Cambra (chamber of young entrepreneurs). Its president was Joan Mas, with Joaquim Molins as secretary- general, with the party including other entrepreneurs like Carlos Ferrer Salat, Carles G√ºell de Sentmenat, Jordi Planasdemunt, Figa and Vicen√ß Llu√≠s Oller, all of them without links neither with the Francoist regime nor with the clandestine democratic opposition. Its program was defined as Catalanist, federalist, pro-European and advocating a free market economy. Influenced by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and linked to the thesis of the Council of Political Forces of Catalonia (), it aimed at occupying a centre-right democratic, progressive space. Ahead of the 1977 Spanish general election, it reached an electoral agreement with the Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) to run under the Union of the Centre and Christian Democracy of Catalonia (UCiDCC) label, but results were regarded as a disappointment after obtaining only one seat‚Äîout of the two obtained by the coalition‚Äîfor G√ºell de Sentmentat, who joined the Mixed Group upon the start of the parliamentary term, resulting in the UCiDCC's dissolution. Following the election, party members adopted a new political line in the congress held in October 1977, advocating for the creation of a new Catalan, progressive and centrist party, that was able to constitute itself in an electoral alternative to the popular strength shown \\"by the socialist and communist left\\" in Catalonia, and which comprised the UCD political space. Negotiations started with the Catalan UCD throughout the second half of 1977, with unsuccessful attempts of bringing the UDC but also Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) and Democratic Left of Catalonia (EDC) into supporting the party's new strategy of establishing \\"the central bloc of Catalan politics\\".

In 1905, a boy was killed in a motor accident at Markyate, Hertfordshire, leading to demands in the Daily Mail that driving tests and certificates of competence be introduced, and the offer of a ¬£100 reward to catch the \\"motor criminals\\". It soon transpired that the car involved in the accident, which did not stop, was owned by Hildebrand Harmsworth, brother of Sir Alfred Harmsworth, owner of the Daily Mail, and driven by Hildebrand's chauffeur. The passengers were Hildebrand Harmsworth's political supporters. The chauffeur was eventually sentenced to a jail term of six months hard labour and his passengers censured for failing to insist that the car stop after the accident. Hildebrand Harmsworth gave ¬£300 to a charity fund to help the boy's mother.

He served in World War I (as a part of the Medical Reserve Corps) in the 370th Infantry. Ballard was the medical officer of the 3rd battalion and was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for his courageous efforts in providing aid for soldiers in the field. After the war, he became infamous within the Los Angeles community and was frequently mentioned for his efforts in the media, publishing several medical research articles himself. Early life Ballard was born on June 14, 1890 to William L Ballard and Mary Ester Tibbs. From his father's side, Ballard was the grandson of John Ballard, born in 1829, a former slave from Kentucky who moved his family to California in the 1850s. After being freed, John Ballard, along with 4000 other African American residents, lived near Santa Monica Mountains. He helped form a stable African-American community at the base of what now is referred to as \\"Ballard Mountain\\". It was formerly named by a racial slur by the white in the area and in the late 19th century it was renamed. John Ballard had married twice, first to Amanda Ballard in 1859 with whom he had eight kids. When she died he married Francis Ballard in 1879. The Ballard family as already well known in the Los Angeles community for the efforts of Claudius's grandfather, aunts and uncles, who all purchased a large array of land to set up institutions for the community's use. John was one of the leading people responsible for the formation of the area's first African Methodist Episcopal church. However, despite the legacy of his family, Ballard would rarely mention his grandfather in his adult life. Raised as a single child, Claudius eventually graduated from Los Angeles High School and went to the University of South California for college. After graduating he would follow to attend University of California, Berkeley for medical school, which he finished in 1913. After completely his qualification exams, Ballard started a medical practice in Los Angeles at the age of 24. According to the medical and surgical United States Registerer, Ballard was situated in 102 1/2 S Central Avenue in 1913. Later in 1914, Ballard would combine his offices with a friend from medical school and the two gentlemen tried to establish a permanent state medical society in Southern California. Later, that Ballard would begin his publishing career when he released a paper called \\"The Pituitary, Its Function and Pathology\\" (April 1915). Before World War I, Ballard was a part of two additional published works, including a medical dialogue called \\"Official and Unofficial Narcotic Preparations\\" (September 1915) and a single paper called \\"Tonsillitis and Its Sequel\\" (December 1915). Upon the United States's entrance into World War I, Ballard was one of the physicians who volunteered and in 1917 he was commissioned as First Lieutenant of the Medical Reserve Corps. Military service Like many of his peers, Ballard was sent for basic training at Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School. He was given the rank of First Lieutenant. Fort Des Moines had been opened for training African-American men as there had been a huge influx of African-American volunteers and a petition was erected by the students of Howard University. However, there was still some discontent at the facility as many soldiers found that he had been unfairly assessed for merely being black. After his training First Lieutenant Ballard was assigned to the 370th Infantry which had formally been 8th Illinois National Guard. Other individuals who'd been a part of the unit were George Washington Antoine, and Rufus Bacote, who were also physicians. Ballard was designated as a Surgeon along with the other lieutenants. Ballard was one of the first African American doctors who arrived at the French lines when sent over in November 1918. He was also accompanied by two dentists of the 370th Infantry, including Lieutenants Roe and Tancil. It was full medical unit who was sent in first. At the time the Medical Detachment was divided in several sections. Ballard was in charge of the Third Battalion. The tasks of these battalions was similar. The French had been facing heavy attack from the German forces at the time, so many of the medical officers would be sent out into the field. The physician and his aids would go into the hail of battle out in the open and render first aid to both severe and mild injuries. The first thing that Ballard and his fellow officers would do was administer an anti-tetanic serum to ensure that the patient would prevent getting tetanus and gas baecilus, as part of procedure. Ballard reached profound acknowledgement for his bravery and undeterred perseverance. In the effort, Ballard had been injured, but still he had refused to be treated or evacuated. Instead, Ballard continued to perform his duty and tend to the wounded. As a result of his efforts, in November 1918, Ballard was awarded the French Croix de Guerre at Mont des Singes at the backs of Ailette River. The French record of the event was stated as follows: \\"General Rondeau, commanding the Infantry of the 59th Division, cites this Brigade Order. Lieut. Dr. Claudius Ballard of the 370th Regimental Infantry, U.S. During the operations of September 30 to October 18, 1918, he remained posted, although wounded, and administered aid to his comrades with an extraordinary devotion until his Battalion was relieved. General Rondeau, Commander of the 59TH Infantry Division\\" At the end of the war, Ballard was honorably discharged on February 21, 1919, and Ballard moved back in with his father in Los Angeles. Career When Ballard returned to Los Angeles he became prominent for his efforts and was frequently seen in various newspaper articles, including one shortly after his return in the California Eagle titled, \\"After Its Victories\\", discussing his role in the war. He continued work in his practice, keeping it away from his family's home. It was during the following decades that California was facing a large wave of migration which needed a large amount of innovation as a result. Ballard's practice grew so much that in the late 1930s he was credited for his efforts. In the 1920s he served as the Secretary of Physicians, Dentists and Druggists Association of South Carolina and continued writing articles for it. At the break of World War II, Dr. Ballard returned to teach first aid at local high schools as there was a mounting fear of attack from foreign powers. Dr. Ballard was well known in the medical community for his intensive research and action whenever there was a threat of disease. He became a member of the Sigma Pi Phi and was a founder of the local Xi Boule. He was also prominently active in the National Medical Association, NAACP, YWCP, YWCA, and the Catholic Church, as they ran a large number of relief charities. In a 1940 Census, Ballard, aged 50, was listed as living with his sons, one 19 years old and the other, 15 years old, at the address 1483 1/2 W 36th Place, Los Angeles, California. Death Ballard died in May 1967 and was buried in Los Angeles. Dr. Ballard was buried in a Roman Catholic Cemetery called Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles. On his gravestone it states \\"Awarded the Croix de Guerre medal in World War I. The medal recognized acts of bravery in the face of the enemy.\\" Personal life On March 5, 1921, Ballard married Miss May Lee Paine. She was from Rome, Georgia. Together they had two sons: Albert Lucky born on March 5, 1921, and Reginald born on November 21, 1924. Sometime before his death, Ballard and his wife separated and she survived him. Albert grew to become an engineer and died in 2011. His second son became prominent in the Los Angeles community as the captain of the Los Angeles Fire Department, which he retired from in 1978, and successful real estate owner. He was one of the leading family members who helped rename \\"Ballard Mountain\\". Reginald had six children, including Ryan Ballard, an educator.

Francois Gendron,Gendron, Francois and Jean-Baptiste de Recoles Quelques Particularitez Du Pays Des Hurons En La Nouvelle France, 1660, p7-8 the French Jesuit surgeon at Sainte-Marie among the Hurons mission, first described its use in the 1640s in letters later published in 1660. Gendron described the sources of these stones as being at the base of Niagara Falls and that a local Native American group settled there and traded this item to other First Nations communities. The ointment created from this rock was said to help the healing of \\"wounds, fistulas and malignant ulcers\\". Exactly what the rock was that this ointment was made from has been open to debate since Gendron first described it. He described the rock as a yellowish salt formed from the petrification of foam formed at the foot of Niagara Falls. There is also debate among historians whether he actually visited the area to collect samples or was supplied with them and a description of their location from Native American traders. Jury and JuryJury, Wilfred and Elsie McLeod Jury Sainte-Marie Among the Huron. Oxford University Press, Toronto. 1954, pp. 106-107 interpreted Gendron‚Äôs description as describing calcareous tufa, a rock formed by precipitation from supersaturated limestone deposits. Hunter,Hunter, James Erie Stone: A Seventeenth Iroquoian Medicinal Trading Commodity, Kewa 85-2:2-8. however, identified it with aragonite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, with inclusion of magnesium sulphate and calcium sulphate. Hunter was able to collect samples from below Niagara Falls in 1982. According to him the mineral forms by the seepage of slightly acidic rain water through limestone formation in the Niagara gorge, most notably the dolomite formation near the top of the Niagara Escarpment. This seepage causes carbonate minerals to dissolve out of the dolomite changing them to a bicarbonate form. Below the dolomite the Rochester Shale is impenetrable to the seeping water causing it to flow horizontal and emerge and run down the rock face of the gorge. Some of this water evaporates leaving a layer of calcium carbonate and aragonite on the rock face. In some areas the accumulation is not much more than a thin film but in others areas he notes it can be four or five centimeters thick.

However, Article 15 of the Constitution of Djibouti] does mention an individual's right to express their opinion \\"...by word, pen, or image...\\" and notes that \\"these rights may be limited by prescriptions in the law and in respect for the honour of others.\\" Despite this, journalism in Djibouti is severely limited by the government and all television and radio stations within the country are government-controlled. The country has one national newspaper called La Nation de Djibouti, which is published daily. It is also owned by the government along with the country's only news agency L'Agence Djiboutienne d'Information. An opposition-backed newspaper, Le Renouveau, ceased operations in 2007 after publishing an article accusing President Isma√Øl Omar Guelleh's brother-in-law (the former governor of the Central Bank of Djibouti, Djama Haid) of accepting bribes. There are also several weekly or monthly publications published by opposition parties, though they are often opinion and politically-based information rather than fact- based news. One example is L'Aurore; founded in 2015 it is published and heavily influenced by the USN, the main opposition coalition in Djibouti. There is one independent radio station which reports uncensored news: La Voix de Djibouti. The station broadcasts in both French and Arabic, and was set up by the Djibouti diaspora in 2010. Although the station broadcasts from Belgium (both online and over AM radio), its employees are subject to Dijbouti's press laws while in Djibouti.  2011 presidential election  The 2011 presidential election, in which the incumbent president Guelleh won with 80% of the vote, was characterized by a number of press freedom incidents. Most notable was the case of two journalists for La Voix de Djibouti, Farah Abadid Heldid and Houssein Robleh Dabar. Heldid and Dabar were originally arrested without a warrant in February of that year, and were held for four months, during which period the presidential election occurred. At some point during his imprisonment, Heldid was interrogated and tortured by the Dijbouti intelligence service, known as the SRD. The journalists were released on June 23, but were again arrested by the SRD later that year for \\"encouraging illegal demonstration and insulting the president.‚Äù According to the Reporters Without Borders, both journalists were tortured and interrogated (until their release on November 24) by Sergeant Major Abdourahman Omar Said, who was also responsible for the death via torture of a Djibouti resident named Dirir Ibrahim Bouraleh earlier that year. However, while the RSF has reported multiple times on such mistreatment of Djibouti journalists, the National Human Rights Commission of Djibouti visited Heldid during one of his jail sentences in 2011 and found no evidence of torture.  Press freedom violations, 2012‚Äì2015  Though most unrest in Djibouti occurs during presidential elections, some press freedom incidents have occurred in the intervening years. In May 2015 an editor for La Voix de Djibouti's website was arrested while in Dijbouti City, the nation's capital. The editor, Maydaneh Abdallah Okieh, was imprisoned for failing to comply with a court order relating to his earlier arrests for \\"defaming a police officer\\". Okieh also reported being tortured and refused medical attention while inside prison. Another reporter from La Voix, Mohamed Ibrahim Waiss, was arrested and beaten by police while covering an opposition party rally in August 2014.  2016 Presidential elections  In January 2016, four months in advance of presidential elections, Djibouti's security service detained two Djiboutian journalists and held them without charge. Mohamed Ibrahim Wa√Øss of La Voix de Djibouti was detained from January 11‚Äì17 and held in Djibouti's Gabode prison, where he was reportedly mistreated, according to Reporters Without Borders. His interrogators forced him to sign a statement and to turn over his password to his Facebook account so that members of the security services could use it to make posts that insulted the country's opposition, according to the France- based press group. He was brought before a court and released January 17 after the government failed to charge him with any crime. It was the fourth time Wa√Øss had been detained in five years. Separately arrested that month was Kadar Abdi Ibrahim of L'Aurore. Ibrahim was detained from January 14‚Äì16 after the newspaper printed a photo of a 7-year-old girl killed after police opened fire on opposition members in the town of Buldhuquo, killing 27 people. Foreign journalists have more freedom than domestic journalists, but still face restrictions by the government. On April 1, 2016, journalists from the British Broadcasting Corporation were expelled from the country ahead of Dijbouti's April 8 national elections. The BBC, as well as the Committee to Protect Journalists, were not given an explanation as to why the team of reporters and producers were forced to leave. The elections were won by the incumbent president Guelleh, resulting in fourth consecutive term in office. Opposition parties within Djibouti reported disappointment with how \\"uncompetitive\\" the election was, while the European Parliament expressed strong concerns with the fairness of the election, stating that it \\"deplores how the way the 8th of April 2016 presidential elections were run.\\"  Outside criticism  The international community generally recognises that Djibouti has a restrictive media environment. Reporters Sans Fronti√®res ranks Djibouti 172nd out of 180 on its Press Freedom Index, while the independent media watchdog Freedom House categorises Djibouti as \\"Not Free\\". Western governments generally refrain from significant criticism of Djibouti's press freedom issues. This is possibly due to its strategic value: Djibouti has proximity to unstable nations like Somalia, Eritrea and Yemen. It is also home to a French military base and the only permanent US military base in Africa. In March 2016, China said it would establish its first permanent overseas military base in Djibouti. In 2012 the US State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour released a report that referred to Djibouti's harsh treatment of journalists as the \\"most serious human rights problem\\" that the country faced. Specifically, it referred to how Guelleh's regime was \\"harassing, abusing, and detaining government critics; denying the population access to independent sources of information; and restricting the freedom of speech and assembly.\\"  References  Djibouti Category:Human rights in Djibouti ","title":"Freedom of the press in Djibouti"},{"id":"51898071","text":"The Sorcerer's House is a 2010 epistolary fantasy novel by Gene Wolfe.

Early life and background William Henry Leigh was an official employee of the Sierra Leone Company and served the company in the early 1800s. Leigh eventually settled in the √éles de Los and was a wealthy smuggler of American goods. Leigh also engaged in the slave trade and was a colleague of Samuel Samo, a Dutch slave trader. Death William Henry Leigh died in 1818 at the Isles de Los at the age of 37 years old. Leigh left a will in which he provided for his several children which was disputed in the English courts in the early nineteenth century. Leigh v Macaulay The case of Leigh v Macaulay (20 February 1835) in which James Leigh, a son of William Henry Leigh, brought an action against Zachary Macaulay was a case in relation to equity and trusts and specifically to the estate of William Henry Leigh. James Leigh was represented by Mr. Simpkinson and the case reached the court of the Lord Chief Baron. Kenneth Macaulay, the executor of William Leigh's estate died indebted to Macaulay and Babington and this mercantile firm used the monies received from the goods from William Leigh's estate sent by Kenneth Macaulay towards the clearance of Kenneth Macaulay's debt. Macaulay and Babington also mixed the produce received from Kenneth Macaulay for their business with the produce sent by Kenneth Macaulay to be realised for William Henry Leigh's estate. It was ruled by the courts that Macaulay and Babington owed James Leigh the amount due from the proceeds of the estate and it was held that the money should be paid into court. Descendants William Henry Leigh had several children with his Nova Scotian Settler mistress and among his descendants are Leslie William Leigh and John Ernest Leigh, the former Sierra Leonean ambassador to the United States.

Published in English translation in 2004, the book was hailed as an important text that applied the sociological concepts developed by Pierre Bourdieu to an analysis of the world literary system by which books are written and consecrated as important works of literature, an economy of prestige that centers on Paris as the world literary capital. Overview The World Republic of Letters is divided into two sections: Part I, \\"The Literary World,\\" and Part II, \\"Literary Revolts and Revolutions.\\" In Part I, \\"The Literary World,\\" Casanova describes the nature of world literature and the structure of the world literary space, in which the path to literary consecration always leads to Paris, the world capital of literature. In order to gain worldwide acceptance and acclaim, writers from marginal countries and languages must find acceptance in the literary world of Paris. In Part II, \\"Literary Revolts and Revolutions,\\" Casanova describes the careers of representative writers whose path to literary consecration demonstrates the principles she described in the book's first part. Writers she discusses include Franz Kafka, V. S. Naipaul, Henri Michaux, E. M. Cioran, Charles- Ferdinand Ramuz, M√°rio de Andrade, W. B. Yeats, John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and William Faulkner. Martin Harries, reviewing the book in Modernism/Modernity, pointed out that The World Republic of Letters includes many passages that are nearly identical to passages in Casanova's earlier book, Samuel Beckett: Anatomy of a Literary Revolution. Harries points to several parallel passages from the two books as evidence that Casanova \\"cannibalized\\" the Beckett book for the later publication. Harries went on to say that Casanova's > wholesale borrowings from the Anatomy in The World Republic suggest the > importance of the example of Beckett to her scholarly project as a whole: > Beckett, she argues, continues and subsumes Joyce‚Äôs modernism. And that > modernism offers a paradigmatic site for her map of ‚Äúworld literary space.‚Äù Reception Terry Eagleton reviewed The World Republic of Letters for the New Statesman. Eagleton praised the book highly, stating that it is in the \\"distinguished lineage\\" of critics like Erich Auerbach, Georg Luk√°cs, and Northrop Frye, each of whom wrote studies that managed to \\"step back from Dante and Goethe, Balzac and Woolf, and view them, in a powerfully distancing move, as part of a meaningful constellation.\\" Eagleton praised the \\"exemplary lucidity\\" of Casanova's book and argued that it \\"represents a milestone in the history of modern literary thought‚Äîeven if it does voice its support for the literary underdog from that citadel of high culture, Paris.\\" Louis Menand, in a review published in The New Yorker, called The World Republic of Letters \\"rather brilliant.\\" Menand wrote, \\"Literature departments are almost always organized by language and country, but Casanova's book gives us many reasons to doubt whether this captures the way literature really works.\\" William Deresiewicz, writing in The Nation, offered a mixed assessment of the book. Deresiewicz found that \\"Casanova‚Äôs work amounts to a radical remapping of global literary space‚Äìwhich means, first of all, the recognition that there is a global literary space.\\" He praised the book and said that \\"the main thrust of Casanova‚Äôs argument, which covers roughly the last century and a half, is unimpeachable. She has created a map of global literary power relations where none had existed, and she has raised a host of further questions.\\" However, he found weaknesses: \\"Casanova‚Äôs reluctance to acknowledge the positive dimensions of the international literary sphere is one of the book‚Äôs flaws.\\" He also observed that \\"Casanova is also surprisingly enamored of the great-man model of historical causation.\\" Thomas Austenfeld, reviewing The World Republic of Letters for the South Atlantic Review, found it \\"ambitious and challenging.\\" Austenfeld lauded the book's international scope, saying that \\"Casanova marshals a truly impressive range of references not often seen together, from Scandinavian to Romanian to Algerian to South American writers. Austenfeld further praised Casanova on the role of translation in disseminating works through the world literary system: \\"Casanova's observations on translation practice are truly incisive, especially when she turns her attention to Beckett and Nabokov, who functioned as self-translators and thus escaped the linguistic prison-house of a national literature.\\" Austenfeld concluded: \\"This book is certain to provoke lively discussion, as any good critical study should. The wide-ranging view Casanova brings to her subject puts her in the companionship of very few literary critics capable of competing with her.\\" Perry Anderson, writing about Casanova's book in the London Review of Books, stated that Casanova's book was an \\"outstanding example of an imaginative synthesis with strong critical intent in recent years.\\" Aamir R. Mufti , writing in Critical Inquiry, argued that a flaw in Casanova's account is that she misunderstood the historical role of Orientalism in shaping the world literary space: > Casanova ... fails to comprehend the real nature of the expansion and > rearrangement of this until then largely European space in the course of the > philological revolution. It is through the philological knowledge > revolution‚Äîthe ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù of the classical languages of the East, the > invention of the linguistic family tree whose basic form is still with us > today, the translation and absorption into the Western languages of more and > more works from Persian, Arabic, and the Indian languages, among others‚Äîthat > non-Western textual traditions made their first entry as literature, sacred > and secular, into the international literary space that had emerged in early > modern times in Europe as a structure of rivalries between the emerging > vernacular traditions, transforming the scope and structure of that space > forever. Emilie Bickerton, reviewing The World Republic of Letters in Bookforum, observed that \\"Casanova's project is to retain the idea of literary autonomy yet, at the same time, to provide a political and historical grounding for it.\\" Bickerton noted the paucity of references to literary theorists‚Äî\\"apart from a scattering of references to Barthes, Foucault, and Deleuze and the passage on Jameson and Said\\"‚Äîand speculated that this fact was explained by Casanova's background in radio journalism, not academia. Bickerton concluded: \\"It is refreshing that Casanova is critical of the centers' failure to enact the claims of universal value worldwide, instead often basing standards and attention on more conventional and established assumptions that are hostile to innovation of any kind‚Äîgrammatical, semantic, or structural.\\" Bali Sahota, reviewing the book for The Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature, questioned Casanova's concept of literariness, finding that it threatens to limit the definition of literature to those works enshrined by institutions: \\"There is no literature then (or no literature worthy of the title), Casanova seems to be suggesting, unless it is a part of, self-consciously located within, and recognized by the institutions of world literary space.\\" Sahota argued that this concept of literariness \\"potentially encloses Casanova in a world of literariness that is most familiar and shuts out whatever might literarily exist autonomously of world literary space.\\" Boyd Tonkin, writing in The Independent, called Casanova's book \\"heroically ambitious\\" and described it as \\"a demanding, rewarding read.\\" Tonkin suggested that for English-speaking readers, \\"much of the appeal lies in her mind-stretching ability to match familiar anecdotes of revolt or migration with linked histories from elsewhere.\\" Tonkin summed up his assessment by saying that Casanova \\"draws a remarkably rich and persuasive map of global writing and publishing not as 'an enchanted world that exists outside time,' but as a battlefield on which dominant languages and cultures have always wielded the heavy weapons.\\" References Sources    * * Category:1999 non-fiction books Category:Books of literary criticism Category:French literary criticism Category:French non-fiction books ","title":"The World Republic of Letters"},{"id":"51898131","text":"Men Above the Law () is a tragedy in five acts by Alexey Pisemsky first published in the No.2, February 1867 issue of Vsemirny Trud magazine.Roshal, A.

The ruins of the city, mostly medieval structures, stretch for a distance of 2.5 km in length and in width in the Khrami river valley. Some of the most recognizable monuments are the Samshvilde Sioni church and a citadel erected on a rocky river promontory. Samshvilde features in the medieval Georgian annals as one of the oldest cities of ancient Kartli, dating back to the 3rd century BC. In the Middle Ages, it was an important stronghold as well as a lively commercial and industrial city. Samshvilde changed hands several times. At the end of the 10th century, it became capital of the Armenian kings of Tashir-Dzoraget and was incorporated in the Kingdom of Georgia in 1064. From the mid-13th century on, as fortunes of the medieval Georgian monarchy faded, Samshvilde went into decline and was reduced to a peripheral military outpost. By the end of the 18th century, it was in ruins. Etymology The etymology of the name of Samshvilde is first recorded by the 10th-century Armenian chronicler Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi as meaning in Georgian \\"three arrows\\", from sami (\\"three\\") and mshvildi (\\"bow\\"). In fact, the toponym is constructed through a Georgian geographic circumfix sae and means \\"[a place] of the bow\\".  History  =Prehistory= Samshvilde is centered in a naturally fortified location, a rocky terrain at the confluence of the Khrami and Chivchavi rivers, 4 km south of the town of Tetritsqaro. The 1968‚Äì1970 archaeological expedition uncovered two layers of the early Bronze Age Kura‚ÄìAraxes culture at Samshvilde, in the southern slopes of Mount Karnkali, dating from the middle of the 4th millennium BC and 3rd millennium BC, respectively. This horizon included a settlement site and burial ground as well as a circular cult building. Artifacts unearthed there were the Bronze-Age pottery and various obsidian tools. =Antiquity= According to the medieval Georgian Chronicles, Samshvilde was formerly known as Orbi, a castle whose foundation was ascribed to Kartlos, the mythic ethnarch of the Georgians of Kartli, and which was found heavily fortified, but besieged and conquered by Alexander the Great during his alleged campaign in the Georgian lands. In the 3rd century BC, under the kings of Kartli, known to the Greco-Roman world as Iberia, Samshvilde became a center of one of the kingdom's subdivisions, run by eristavi (\\"duke\\"), first appointed by Parnavaz, the first in the traditional list of the kings of Kartli. King Archil (c. 411‚Äì435) gave Samshvilde in appanage to his son Mihrdat who then succeeded on the throne of Kartli. Mihrdat's Iranian wife Sagdukht, a convert to Christianity, is credited by a Georgian chronicle to have built the church of Sioni at Samshvilde. =Middle Ages= An 8th-century Georgian inscription from the Samshvilde Sioni Church The borders of the duchy of Samshvilde fluctuated in the course of history, as the southern portion of it was frequently contested between Kartli and the neighboring kings of Armenia. The city itself remained one of the key settlements of Iberia. Along with Tbilisi and Mtskheta, Samshvilde is listed as one of the three main towns of that country in the 7th-century Armenian geography by Anania Shirakatsi. The 8th-century Georgian inscription at the Sioni church, in an asomtavruli script, makes mention of two persons of the house of pitiakhsh, an Iranian-styled local dynasts who appear to have been in possession of Samshvilde. By that time, the region around Samshvilde fell under influence of the newly established Muslim emirate, centered in Tbilisi, the former royal capital of Kartli. From this time on, Samsvhilde was contested among various Georgian, Armenian, and Muslim rulers. Around 888, Samshvilde was occupied by the Bagratid king Smbat I of Armenia, who entrusted the town to the charge of the two brothers of the Gntuni family, Vasak and Ashot. The brothers proved to be unruly and Smbat's successor, Ashot II, had to bring them back to allegiance by force of arms c. 915. Vasak Gntuni was still recalcitrant and, c. 921, defected to the Georgian prince Gurgen II of Tao, prompting King Ashot to put the fortress under siege. As a force sent by Gurgen was entering the citadel, fighting broke out between it and Vasak's men garrisoning the fortress, who eventually let Ashot's army in. In an ensuing confrontation, Gurgen's surviving soldiers were taken captive and mutilated, while Samshvilde again submitted to the Armenian king. In the closing decade of the 10th century, Samshvilde passed to the Kuirikids, an Armenian Bagratid collateral line of the Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget, who chose it as their capital. On account of this, David I, king of Tashir and Dzoraget, was referred to as Samshvildari, that is, \\"of Samshvilde\\", by a medieval Georgian author. In 1001, David revolted, unsuccessfully, from the hegemony of his uncle, King Gagik I of Armenia, who, in a three-month-long campaign, ravaged Tashir, Samshvilde, and the Plain of the Georgians (Vrac'dast), as the historian Stepanos Asoghik referred to the surrounding district. Samshvilde served as the Kuirikid capital until a member of that dynasty, Kiurike II, was made captive by King Bagrat IV of Georgia and had to ransom himself by surrendering Samshvilde to the Georgians in 1064. Bagrat's son, George II, conceded control of the city to his powerful vassal Ivane I, Duke of Kldekari, thereby buying his loyalty, in 1073. Within a year or so, Samshvilde was conquered by the Seljuqs under Malik-Shah I and remained their outpost in Georgia until 1110, when Bishop George of Chqondidi besieged and took the city on behalf of King David IV of Georgia. This induced the Seljuqs to hastily evacuate most of surrounding districts. David then granted Samshvilde to his loyal commander, Ivane Orbeli, in 1123. The city remained in possession of the Orbeli clan, hereditary commanders-in-chief of the Kingdom of Georgia, until they lost it to the crown as a result of their failed revolt against George III of Georgia, in the course of which the king's loyal army stormed the fortress in 1178. Decline Samshvilde was attacked by the invading Mongols on their way to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, in 1236. In March 1440, it was sacked by Jahan Shah, leader of the Kara Koyunlu, indignant at refusal of Alexander I of Georgia to submit to his suzerainty. According to the contemporary historian Thomas of Metsoph, Jahan Shah captured the besieged city \\"through deceit\\" on the day of Pentecost and massacred its population, building a minaret of 1,664 severed human heads at the gate of the city; sixty Christian priests, monks, and noblemen were put to death for their refusal to apostatize. Even some of those who agreed to renounce Christianity were not spared. Survivors had to seek refuge in the thick forests around Samshvilde. The city never fully recovered from this blow and lost its past importance, save for its function as a peripheral fortress. After the final disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1490s, it became part of the Kingdom of Kartli. In 1578, Samshvilde was occupied by the Ottoman army under Lala Mustafa Pasha during its victorious campaign in Georgia, but, in 1583, it was recovered by King Simon I of Kartli. In 1636, Rostom of Kartli granted Samshvilde in possession to his treasurer, Shiosh Khmaladze, and, in 1693, Heraclius I of Kartli bestowed it upon the Baratashvili noble family. Samshvilde rose to relative importance in 1747, when the Muslim Georgian prince Abdullah Beg employed Lesgian mercenaries and fortified the Samshvilde fortress in his quest to challenge the hold of Kartli exercised by his Christian relative, Teimuraz II. Abdullah Beg's designs were dashed by Teimuraz's son, Heraclius, who stormed Samshvilde and made the pretender captive in 1749. The city was left in the hands of Abdullah Beg's younger brother, Husayn Beg, who, in 1751, surrendered to Heraclius II and resettled to Tbilisi.  Monuments  Ruins of the Samshvilde Sioni Church as of 2012. One of the ruined churches of the Samshvilde complex. The archaeological horizon and architectural monuments of Samshvilde are inscribed on the list of the National Heritage of Georgia as the City-Site of Samshvilde (·É°·Éê·Éõ·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·Éì·Éò·É° ·Éú·Éê·É•·Éê·Éö·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éò). Archaeological study of the Samshvilde area began in 1948 and systematic efforts for better conservation of the site were launched in 1978. In the 2000s, construction of major international pipelines in the region prompted new archaeological projects and discovery of new prehistoric features. Many of the late medieval and early modern structures were further studied by the Samshvilde Archaeological Expedition organized by the Tbilisi- based University of Georgia from 2012 to 2015. The city-site occupies a nearly triangular area on a promontory at the Khrami‚ÄìChivchavi confluence and is divided into three main parts. The citadel is on the east, on a steep edge of the promontory, and the city proper lies on the west, with the walled fortress in between them. The site includes ruins of several churches, a citadel, palaces, houses, a bridge over the Chivchavi river, water cisterns, bathes, a cemetery, and other accessory structures. A small hall-church of St. George stands in the city proper. A now-lost Georgian inscription of 1672, published by E. Takaishvili, identifies the lady called Zilikhan, a former caretaker of the wife of King Vakhtang V of Kartli, as a renovator of the church. Inside the fortress walls, stands a small stone church, that of the Dormition, which contains a large, prehistoric black menhir, sooty of candle flames, with a cross and an Armenian text mentioning the prince Smbat inscribed into it in the 11th century. The Khrami river is overlooked by another church, known as the Theogenida, probably built in the 12th or 13th century, near which a structure made of four big stones, a tetralith, is found. The citadel consists of massive walls, towers, and three larger churches. Among these is the domed Sioni church, now in ruins, the most recognizable landmark of Samshvilde. The medieval tradition ascribes its construction to the 5th-century queen Sagdukht, but the extant edifice dates to c. 759‚Äì777 as suggested by a Georgian inscription from the better-preserved eastern fa√ßade, containing references to the contemporary Byzantine emperors Constantine V and Leo IV the Khazar. There is another, heavily damaged, almost illegible Georgian inscription in the southern fa√ßade and, next to it, a fragment in Armenian identifying the Armenian catholicos Gevorg III Loretsi (r. 1069‚Äì1072). The strict architectural forms of the Samshvilde church reveal close affinities with design of the 7th-century Tsromi church in Shida Kartli. West to the Sioni is a three-nave basilica, probably an Armenian church, built of dark basalt stones in the 10th or 11th century. The third church is a hall-church design, with a protruding apse and a wall inscription in Georgian, mentioning King David IV of Georgia (r. 1089‚Äì1125).

St. John's College--Fordham University  He became the tenth president of St. John's College (now known as Fordham University) in 1868, and held the office until 1874. Shea's tenure was notable for his introduction in 1869 of reforms to the curriculum, disciplinary practices, and student housing, largely in response to student dissatisfaction. In 1868, students had organized a conspiracy to transfer to the College of St. Francis Xavier during the semester break. Since those students would not return to Rose Hill after Christmas break, they were prepared to destroy the windows of the college buildings. The conspiracy was thwarted and its leaders expelled. Shea tried to ease the tension through numerous concessions, including the introduction of a smoking room, permitting some students to live in private rooms on the upper floors seminaries, and by introducing a six year commercial course of studies as an alternative to the classics-based curriculum. These concessions and reforms were met with opposition from the other Jesuits and failed to end the dissatisfaction of the students. In 1874, Shea left his position as president and was assigned to the College of St. Francis Xavier. He died in New York on December 5, 1881.  Legacy  While Shea was unable to make all the improvements he wanted, during his presidency the arrival of Father Thomas J.A. Freeman ensured a new focus on sciences at St. John's College. With Shea's support, Freeman was given space in the diocesan seminary building (today's St. John's Hall) to develop a science department and laboratory. Shea's successors continued to support Freeman's scientific curiosities, and Freeman was later instrumental in the introduction of electricity and electrical lighting on the Fordham campus. Shea's attempt to expand the so- called commercial course (as opposed to the \\"classics course\\" based on the traditional Jesuit curriculum known as Ratio studiorum) was short-lived, but the commercial course would prove over the long-term to be lucrative.

He created Van Dale's Great Dictionary of the Dutch Language (); first published in 1874, after his death. It was, and in its subsequent editions remains, the leading dictionary of the Dutch language. Biography Van Dale's parents were from Eeklo, in the Flemish province of East Flanders, Belgium. There was a smallpox epidemic in Meetjesland, in East Flanders: Abram (Abraham) van Dale (1799-1837) and his pregnant wife Pietje (Pieternella Johanna du Bois, 1802-1865) fled from it to Sluis, in the Netherlands; where their son, Johan Hendrik, was born. Johan Hendrik must have been an excellent student and scholar. At the age of 16, he was awarded an official teaching certificate (onderwijsbevoegdheid), fourth class. Four years later, he was promoted to the second class. In 1854, he was appointed headmaster of the public school in Sluis. In 1857, he was appointed honorary city archivist. He wrote textbooks about the importance of clarity in language, and articles about the history of Sluis. In 1866, he published his first lexographical work: Taalkundig handboekje, of alphabetische lijst van alle Nederlandsche woorden, die wegens spelling of taalkundig gebruik aan eenige bedenking onderhevig zijn (\\"Linguistic handbook, or alphabetical list of all Dutch words which, on account of their spelling or linguistic use, may be open to objection\\"). In 1867, he was asked to revise the Nieuw woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal (\\"New Dictionary of the Dutch Language\\" (nl)) of 1864 by and , which used the obsolete Siedenbeek spelling (nl) rather than the recently-proposed De Vries and Te Winkel spelling (nl). He accepted the task, and completed it within four years. He wrote in the preface to the first edition, of 1872: The dictionary was in its final stages of completion - the first volume had already been published - when, in 1872, van Dale caught smallpox, and died of it. His pupil (kwekeling (nl)) saw the rest of it through to publication. The first edition of the Groot woordenboek received some criticism for not upholding academic standards of correctness; but was also widely praised. From its fourth edition on, and in its later revisions, van Dale's name has been attached to the Groot woordenboek as a sign of its authority in all matters concerning the Dutch language.

It stars Armie Hammer as a United States Marine who steps on something with big chance to be a land mine during a botched mission and must remain still until help arrives. The film was released in the United States on April 7, 2017. Plot In North Africa, US Marine sniper Mike Stevens and his spotter Tommy Madison are on a secret mission to assassinate a dangerous terrorist leader attending a Bedouin wedding. Mike botches the assassination attempt, hesitating when the target's son steps in the way. Due to a glare off the sniper scope, Mike and Tommy are discovered by the enemy and attacked. However, a sandstorm forces the enemy to retreat, leaving Mike and Tommy behind. Seeking an immediate evacuation, the two are instructed to find their way to a village where they can be picked up once the sandstorm stops. However, en route to the village, Tommy steps on a land mine which blows off his legs. Moments later, Mike steps on something with a big chance to be another land mine, but realizes he has done so and avoids stepping off it. Tommy, hoping to prevent Mike from giving him medical attention (and thereby blowing off his own legs), shoots himself with his pistol. Now alone, Mike contacts his superior via transmitter, who tells him that he will have to hold out for a few days before he can be rescued. Exposed to the harsh environment of the desert, Stevens battles both the psychological and physical tolls of the treacherous situation he is trapped in, recalling memories or imagining appearances of Tommy, his girlfriend, his parents, and moments from when he was a young boy. Mike is visited several times by the Berber, who long ago lost one of his legs as well as his only daughter to a landmine he had intended to take and sell to enemy soldiers. The Berber, who speaks some English, urges Mike to step off the thing and move forward with life. He insists that Mike is a lucky man, after surviving a night attack by desert dogs while simultaneously managing to keep his foot still on the same place. Mike is later attacked by enemy insurgents, who had traced him to his current location, but is able to fight them off. Mike then reluctantly decides to accept the Berber's advice, having grown weary of his predicament. He steps off the thing - only for it not to explode, as he is almost sure that it's a land mine. He digs and discovers that what he had assumed to be an explosive was actually just a tin can with a little toy soldier inside of it. He sets off a flare and is finally rescued. Back in the United States, he reunites with his girlfriend, to whom he finally proposes.

Guaglione was at first against Hammer's casting, because of his previous \\"charming\\" roles and once said to producer Peter Safran that \\"if [Armie Hammer] stars, the movie's dead\\". However, Safran convinced him by telling him of Hammer's collaborations with famous directors such as David Fincher, Clint Eastwood, and Guy Ritchie, and organizing a meeting with the actor. For the role of US Marine Tommy Madison, Guaglione and Resinaro considered over 50 American actors, including Rami Malek, Adam Brody and Chris Zylka, before choosing British actor Tom Cullen. The movie was shot in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. The directors dedicated the film in memory of their location manager, Nikolai Semjevski (1975 - 2015).  Release  Mine was released in Italy on 6 October 2016 by Eagle Pictures. It was released on April 7, 2017 in the United States by Well Go USA Entertainment, and in United Kingdom by Universal Pictures. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on 29 reviews, and an average rating of 3.99/10.

History The Premonstratensians wore white habits (as on mannequin pictured) and were known as \\"White Canons.\\" A monastic site existed on the island from the 7th century AD, and a gable and church doorway of the 9th century survive. Holy Trinity Priory was founded in 1215 by Clarus Mag M√°ilin, archdeacon of Elphin, the island being gifted by Cathal O'Reilly, king of East Br√©ifne. Some monks came here from Boyle Abbey in 1228. It was raised to abbey status c. 1235. The standard claustral plan was envisaged but only the east range was actually built. It acquired a daughter house on Lough Oughter, County Cavan in 1237. The religious and lay brothers were buried within the abbey and in two cemeteries on the island. In 1436 the anchoress Gormfhlaith died here. Excavation suggests that the building to the north of the church was rebuilt after burning down in the 15th century, and this is confirmed by an annal entry in 1466 which blamed a fire on \\"the negligence of a woman.\\" The Annals of Loch C√©, covering events between 1014 and 1590, were written here. Holy Trinity Abbey was held in commendam by Ruaidri mac Diarmata (Rory MacDermot, King of Moylurg) from 1548 and granted to a Robert Harrison in 1594. Sir Conyers Clifford was buried there in 1599. The abbey owned property at Aghnasurn and Estersnow. The last monks left in 1608 when King James I confiscated the monastery. One tomb on the island is of √öna Bh√°n MacDermot (\\"Fair √öna\\"). She was daughter of Brian √ìg MacDermot (king of Moylurg 1603‚Äì36) who refused to let her to marry Tom√°s L√°idir Costello (\\"Strong Thomas\\"), the son of one of his enemies. She died of a broken heart, and Tom√°s is said to have swam across to weep at her grave. Later he died too, and was buried next to √öna. A 1991 excavation found silver coins of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, bronze ferrule, iron knife and nails, pottery and rotary quern fragments. Buildings The Abbey was constructed from the local rocks: pale grey sandstone and limestone. The church contained sedilia and chapter room.

Biography  She was born to a family of Baltic-Germans who had moved from Saint Petersburg to Danzig after falling out of favor at court. Her father was a retired Prussian Army captain, her mother, Helene (1837-1924), was an amateur artist and her younger sister, became a popular novelist. She began drawing as a young girl; inspired by the magical themes of the fairy tales she and her friends acted out. Later, she would sketch from nature. After graduating from a women's college, she went to K√∂nigsberg in 1878 for professional lessons, but the Kunstakademie did not accept female students at that time, so she took private lessons with some local artists. The Apotheosis of a Witch (A Witch on Pegasus) In 1884, she began to divide her time between Budda and Berlin and was finally able to secure lessons from a notable painter, the Swiss portraitist, Karl Stauffer-Bern, who introduced her to the work of the Symbolist, Arnold B√∂cklin; a major influence on her style. This was followed by lessons from Max Koner, known as the \\"Kaisermaler\\", who ran a famous studio for female artists. She completed her studies around 1888/89 with Hugo Vogel. In 1892, she began to exhibit in the Berlin salons and became associated with the \\"\\", a group of female artists. Sometime in the late 1890s, she settled permanently in Berlin. She took a semi-detached house and set up a studio there, near a studio that was frequented by members of the Expressionist group, Die Br√ºcke. In 1901, she started to exhibit with the Berlin Secession. She was also associated with the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund. =Career setbacks= For reasons that are unclear, she broke with the Secession in 1912, an act which brought her career to a virtual standstill. Between then and 1936, she was represented at only one large exhibition in 1914 in Leipzig. Her friend, K√§the Kollwitz, who was a member of the Secession's selection jury, tried to get some of her works accepted in 1916, but was unsuccessful. Death and the Maiden She was helped through this period by her sisters, especially Elisabeth, who was making a good living from her writing. When Elisabeth died in 1930, Clara became severely depressed and, within a few years, was destitute. As a last resort, she applied to the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda for financial support, and it was granted. She later became a member of the Reichskulturkammer, but never joined the Nazi Party. In 1936, the gallery owner Wolfgang Gurlitt became aware of her and organized the largest exhibition of her works during her lifetime (174 pieces) but it was not a critical success. A planned follow-up exhibition was cancelled due to the start of World War II. In 1943, her home and studio were destroyed by a bombing raid and she sought refuge with a neighbor. A large part of her work was destroyed at that time. By then, she was no longer receiving her annual pension from the Ministry and was soon living in poverty. For many years, it was believed that she was killed during a bombing raid in 1944, but a letter from her sister Victoria, published in 2012, indicates that she died shortly after the end of the war from a heart ailment. She was largely forgotten until 2008, when a major retrospective was presented at the in Regensburg, titled \\"Clara Siewert - Between Dream and Reality\\". Most of her approximately 170 known surviving works, in various media, are now displayed there. Sources * Roman Zieglg√§nsberger, Clara Siewert.

Gilgut and Ray Ethan Torrey Professor Emeritus in the Biology Department of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who is notable for his work on elucidating the roles of calcium, membranes and the cytoskeleton in plant cell development and cell motility. Personal life Peter Klock Hepler was born on October 29, 1936, in Dover, New Hampshire, to Jesse Raymond Hepler and Rebecca Orpha Peterson Hepler. He married Margaret (Peggy) Dennison Hunt on March 7, 1964. They have three children: Sarah, Anna and Lukas. Peter and Peggy have six grandchildren: Finn, Leif, Louisa (Lulu), Jesse, Marit, and Haakon. In an interview published in the Newsletter of the American Society of Plant Biologists, Hepler was asked, \\"What is your most treasured possession?\\" He answered, \\"My family; but I don't possess them.\\" Peter and Peggy Hepler live on a farm in Pelham, Massachusetts that was established by John Gray in 1740 and is now a part of the Kestrel Land Trust. University life Peter Hepler graduated from Dover High School in 1954. He received his B.S. in chemistry from the University of New Hampshire in 1958 and earned his Ph.D. in plant cell biology from University of Wisconsin in 1964, studying the role of cortical microtubules in plant cell development with Eldon H. Newcomb. After receiving his Ph.D., Hepler served at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research until 1966, studying malarial parasites. Hepler then returned to the University of Wisconsin for a postdoctoral fellowship and then became a postdoctoral fellow with Keith Porter at Harvard University from 1966-1967, where he continued his investigation of microtubules, focusing on their role in the mitotic apparatus and the phragmoplast of the endosperm cells of Haemanthus Katharinae. After being an assistant professor at Stanford University, Hepler joined the faculty in the Botany Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He was an associate professor from 1977 to 1980, a professor from 1980-1989, and became the Ray Ethan Torrey Professor in 1989 and the Constantine J. Gilgut Professor in 1998. Hepler retired from the Biology Department as the Constantine J. Gilgut and Ray Ethan Torrey Professor Emeritus, although he continues to do research. Hepler spent many summers teaching and doing research at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Hepler also participated in a multiyear international collaboration with Brian E. S. Gunning. Hepler was an Associate Editor of Protoplasma from 1994-2001 and Associate Editor of Plant Physiology from 1998-2000. He has been on the editorial boards of the Annual Review Plant Physiology, Plant and Cell Physiology, the Journal of Submicroscopic Cytology, Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton, and BioEssays. Research Hepler's scientific method is to know thoroughly the classical botanical literature and then develop or apply modern physico-chemical techniques to answer salient and extensive biological questions using plants that are well-suited to answer those questions. In so doing, Hepler opened whole areas of research. Hepler did pioneering work in showing the relationship of the microscopic elements of the cytoskeleton to the macroscopic properties of plant growth, development and function. He also did pioneering work on plasmodesmata, stomatal function,, the role of calcium in plant development and in the development of techniques useful for answering questions using light and electron microscopy. Hepler's scientific publications with Barry A. Palevitz are notable for quoting Woody Allen and Yogi Berra. Hepler described his realization of the influence a review he and Palevitz wrote on microtubules and microfilaments \\"to introduce new thoughts and promising avenues for future research\\" had with his characteristic self- deprecating sense of humor: \\"I became aware that the review was being read widely one summer (1979) while working in the library at the Marine Biological Laboratory. I turned to the library's volume of the Annual Review of Plant Physiology that contained our paper and when I put the volume down, it literally fell open at our article; worn edges on the pages and the penciled corrections of all the misspellings and punctuation errors indicated that the chapter had been thoroughly perused.\\" Hepler, along with Ledbetter and Porter, is considered to be a co-discoverer of microtubules. =Microtubules and cell shape= In late 1962 and early 1963, Hepler tested the newly developed procedure using a glutaraldehyde pre-fix followed by an osmium post-fix to study plant cell structure using an electron microscope. Building on the earlier work by Sinnott and Bloch, who had shown that wounding the existing tracheary elements in a Coleus stem induced neighboring parenchyma cells to differentiate into new tracheary elements, Hepler showed that cytoplasmic microtubules were localized specifically in the cortical cytoplasm immediately over the bands of new secondary wall thickenings. Moreover, Hepler discovered that the microtubules were oriented parallel to the cellulose microfibrils of the newly formed secondary wall thickenings. This work, along with the studies of Ledbetter and Porter and Green established the importance of cortical microtubules in controlling the alignment of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall. Further work with Barry Palevitz showed that microtubules were involved in orienting the cellulose microfibrils in the walls of guard cells in a pattern of radial micellation that is necessary for stomatal function. Hepler, along with the husband and wife team of Dale Callaham and Sue Lancelle, developed a method to achieve rapid freeze fixation of particularly small plant cells that showed that cortical microtubules are closely associated with one another, actin microfilaments, the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. =Microtubules and cell motility= Building on the work of Shinya Inou√© and Andrew Bajer using polarized light microscopy, Hepler used electron microscopy to elucidate the nature of the microtubule/chromosome attachments at the kinetochore as well as the arrangement of the microtubules in the phragmoplast during the development of the new cell wall, where microtubules from both sides of the phragmoplast were seen to overlap with one another in the plane of the cell plate. Hepler realized that microtubules were dynamic structures that were deployed in various locations throughout the cell, and became interested in the mechanisms involved in microtubule organization in cells that lacked a microtubule-organizing center known as the centrosome. In order to understand how microtubule-organizing centers were generated, Hepler examined the de novo formation of the blepharoplast in the spermatogenous cells of Marsilea vestita. The blepharoplast in each spermatid generates 100‚Äì150 basal bodies, each of which gives rise to the 9+2 arrangement of microtubules in a cilium. During telophase of the penultimate division, flocculent material appears near clefts on the distal surfaces of the daughter nuclei. During prophase of the final division which gives rise to the spermatids, the flocculent material near each nucleus condenses to give rise to two blepharoplasts, which then separate, one going to each spermatid. While Hepler was successful in identifying an aggregation of material that possessed microtubule-organizing capacity, he was not able to specify the biophysical mechanisms involved in organization. After Richard Weisenberg discovered that microtubule polymerization was sensitive to calcium concentration, Hepler realized that he had already seen a close association between elements of the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules in the mitotic apparatus and in the phragmoplast and suggested that these membranes may function in controlling the concentration of free calcium in the mitotic apparatus. Along with Susan Wick and Steve Wolniak, Hepler showed that the endoplasmic reticulum contained stores of calcium and suggested that the endoplasmic reticulum may locally control the calcium concentration and thus the polymerization/depolymerization of microtubules. Subsequently, Hepler, along with Dale Callaham, Dahong Zhang, and Patricia Wadsworth, observed calcium ion transients during mitosis and showed that the microinjection of calcium ions into the mitotic spindle does regulate the depolymerization of microtubules and the movement of chromosomes to the poles during mitosis. =Microfilaments and cytoplasmic streaming= Hepler identified actin microfilaments in bundles at the ectoplasm-endoplasm interface of Nitella internodal cells by showing that the bundles bound heavy meromyosin, giving the characteristic arrowhead arrangement. The actin microfilaments had the correct polarity to be part of the actomyosin motor that provides the motive force for cytoplasmic streaming in these giant algal cells. =Calcium and plant development= Hepler has shown that calcium ions are a central regulator of plant growth and development specifically demonstrating that calcium is important for tip growth and in phytochrome. and cytokinin action. =Pollen tube growth= Hepler‚Äôs research is currently aimed at finding the ionic and molecular components that make up the pacemaker that regulates the oscillatory growth of pollen tubes. He has shown that calcium ions and protons are essential for growth. The intracellular free calcium ions exist in a gradient dropping from 3000 nM at the tip to 200 nM 20 Œºm from the tip and the intracellular H+ gradient falls from pH 6.8 at the tip to pH 7.5 10‚Äì30 Œºm from the tip. The higher concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ and H+ at the tip result from the localization of the influx of these ions at the tip. The protons are effluxed at a region on the sides of the tube that corresponds to the location of the intracellular alkaline band. Energy is required for pollen tube growth and an H+-ATPase may mediate the efflux. Hepler has shown that the magnitude of the intracellular calcium and proton gradients and the extracellular fluxes of these ions oscillate with a period of 15-50 s. This period is identical to the period of oscillation in the rate of pollen tube growth, however, the intracellular calcium peak follows the growth rate peak by 1-4 seconds, and the extracellular calcium peak follows the growth rate peak by 11-15 seconds. The delay between the extracellular and intracellular calcium peaks indicates that calcium ions do not immediately enter the cytoplasmic pool. Hepler postulates that the extracellular influx of calcium is not governed by the plasma membrane but by changes in the ion-binding properties of the pectin within the cell wall. The pectin is secreted in its uncharged methylester form. Subsequently, a pectin methylesterase in the wall results in the de-esterification of the methyl groups that yields carboxyl residues that bind calcium and form calcium-pectate cross-bridges. This calcium binding may account for the bulk of the observed extracellular current. The intracellular calcium gradient may direct the location of secretion of cell wall components that define the direction of pollen tube growth. The intracellular components that contribute to pollen tube growth include the actin-mediated transfer of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles filled with methylesterified homogalacturonans and pectin methylesterase synthesized on the ER to the growing tip. The secretion of the vesicles at the growing tip anticipates the increase in growth rate, indicating that the turgor pressure driven intussusception of the methylesterified pectin into the cell wall at the growing tip and its subsequent demethylesterification by pectin methylesterase may relax the cell wall by robbing the load-bearing calcium pectate bonds of its Ca2+. This would result in a slightly delayed yet increased growth rate. The removal of the methoxy groups in the pectins at the flanks of the apical dome unmasks their negatively charged carboxylate groups. The anionic homogalacturonans then bind Ca2+ and become stiffer as the new apical dome, which will incorporate more methylesterified pectins and pectin methylesterase, grows away from the stiffened flanks composed of calcium pectate. The external Ca2+ concentration is critical. When the external Ca2+ concentration is below 10 ŒºM, the amount of calcium pectate is so low that the cell wall is too weak and the pollen tube bursts. When the external Ca2+ concentration is above 10 mM, the amount of calcium pectate is so high that the cell wall is too stiff and the pollen tube will not grow. Honors and awards *In 1975, Hepler was the fourth recipient of the Jeanette Siron Pelton Award given by the Botanical Society of America, because his \\"penetrating analytical and experimental studies of the ultrastructure of differentiating cells have made a significant and lasting contribution to our perception of morphogenesis at the cellular level. In particular his work on the ultrastructure of differentiating xylem elements, on the roles of microtubules and microfibrils, and on the control of the orientation of mitotic spindles in differentiating cells have provided new insights which hold great promise for the future.\\" *In 2007, Hepler was named an inaugural Fellow of the American Society of Plant Biologists. *In 2010, Hepler was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his contributions as \\"one of the most influential plant cell biologists, who has continuously and continues to achieve breakthroughs that have guided research directions of numerous plant scientists.\\" *In 2011, Hepler was honored with the Charles Reid Barnes Life Membership Award from the American Society of Plant Biologists. *In 2015, Hepler was named an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society for his contributions to plant science, including publishing the first report suggesting a co-alignment of microtubules with cell wall cellulose microtubules. *A scholarship was named in honor of Hepler.

It was also the first publication in the University of Hawai'i Press's \\"ABC\\" (Alphabetically Based Computerized) series of Chinese dictionaries. They republished the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary in a pocket edition (1999) and desktop reference edition (2000), as well as the expanded ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Comprehensive Dictionary (2003) and dual ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish/English-Chinese Dictionary (2010). Furthermore, the ABC Dictionary databases have been developed into computer applications such as Wenlin Software for learning Chinese (1997). History John DeFrancis (1911‚Äì2009) was an influential American sinologist, author of Chinese language textbooks, lexicographer of Chinese dictionaries, and Professor Emeritus of Chinese Studies at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa. After he retired from teaching in 1976, DeFrancis was a prolific author of influential works such as The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy (1984) and Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems (1989). Victor H. Mair, a sinologist and professor of Chinese at the University of Pennsylvania, first proposed the idea of a computerized pinyin Chinese‚ÄìEnglish dictionary in his 1986 lexicographical review article \\"The Need for an Alphabetically Arranged General Usage Dictionary of Mandarin Chinese.\\" He defined \\"alphabetically arranged dictionary\\" to mean a dictionary in which all words (c√≠ Ë©û) are \\"interfiled strictly according to pronunciation. This may be referred to as a \\"single sort/tier/layer alphabetical\\" order or series.\\" He emphatically does not mean a usual Chinese dictionary collated according to the initial single graphs (z√¨ Â≠ó) that are only the beginning syllables of whole words. \\"With the latter type of arrangement, more than one sort is required to locate a given term. The head character must first be found and then a separate sort is required for the next character, and so on.\\" (1986: 2). Mair's article had two purposes, to call the attention of his colleagues to the critical need for an alphabetically arranged Chinese dictionary and to enlist their help in making it a reality, and to suggest that all new sinological reference tools should at least include alphabetically ordered indices. \\"Someone who already knows the pronunciation of a given expression but not its meaning should not be cruelly burdened by having to fuss with radicals, corners, strokes, and what not. Let him go directly to the object of his search instead of having to make endless, insufferable detours in an impenetrable forest of graphs.\\" (1986: 20). In DeFrancis' Acknowledgements, he says \\"This dictionary owes its genesis to the initiative of Victor H. Mair\\", who after unsuccessful attempts to obtain financial support for the compilation of an alphabetically based Chinese‚ÄìEnglish dictionary, in 1990 organized an international group of scholars who volunteered to contribute towards compiling it. However, \\"agonizingly slow progress\\" made it apparent that a fulltime editor was necessary, and in May 1992 John DeFrancis offered to undertake the project centered at the University of Hawai'i (1996: ix). Along with Prof. DeFrancis overseeing the general planning and supervision of the project as well as its detailed operations, a volunteer team of some 50 contributors ‚Äì including academics, Chinese language teachers, students, lexicographers, and computer consultants ‚Äì were involved in the myriad tasks of processing dictionary entries, such as defining, inputting, checking, and proofreading. The University of Hawai'i Press published the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary in September 1996. UHP republished the original paperback ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, which had a total 916 pages and was 23 cm. high, into the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary: Pocket Edition (1999, 16 cm.) and hardback ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary: Desk Reference Edition (2000, 23 cm.). In Shanghai, DeFrancis' dictionary was published under the title Han-Ying Cidian: ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary (Hanyu Dacidian Chubanshe, 1997). For reasons of political correctness, the Shanghai edition amended the entry for Lin Biao (Sawer 2001: 225). It altered the original American edition's \\"veteran Communist military leader and Mao Zedong's designated successor until mysterious death\\" to \\"veteran Communist military leader; ringleader of counterrevolutionary group (during Cultural Revolution)\\". Victor H. Mair became general editor of the ABC Chinese Dictionary Series in 1996, and the University of Hawai'i Press has issued ten publications (as of October 2016), including two developments from the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary (1996) with 71,486 head entries. John DeFrancis and others edited the hardback ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Comprehensive Dictionary (2003, 1464 pp., 25 cm.), which contains over 196,501 head entries, making it the most comprehensive one- volume dictionary of Chinese. DeFrancis (posthumously) and Zhang Yanyin, professor of Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics at the University of Canberra, edited the bidirectional paperback ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish/English- Chinese Dictionary (2010, 1240 pp., 19 cm.). It contains 67,633 entries: 29,670 in the English-Chinese section, 37,963 in the Chinese‚ÄìEnglish section, which is an abridgment of the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Comprehensive Dictionary and includes improvements such as more usage example sentences.

In 1997, the Wenlin Institute published Wenlin Software for Learning Chinese with about 14,000 head entries (version 1.0) and entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Hawaii to utilize the ABC Dictionary database in Wenlin software. The first edition ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary (1996) was incorporated into Wenlin 2.0 with over 74,000 entries (1998); the second ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Comprehensive Dictionary (2003) went into Wenlin 3.0 with over 196,000 entries (2002); and the third edition ABC English- Chinese/Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary (2010) was incorporated into Wenlin 4.0 (2011), which includes 300,000 Chinese‚ÄìEnglish entries, 73,000 Chinese character entries, and 62,000 English-Chinese entries. Prior to the alphabetically arranged ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, virtually every Chinese dictionary was based upon character head entries, arranged either by character shape or pronunciation, that subsume words and phrases written with that head character as the first syllable. While pronunciation determines the placement of words within the unconventional ABC Dictionary, Chinese characters still determine the position of words within a standard dictionary. Comparing a Chinese character-based dictionary with the pinyin-based ABC Dictionary illustrates the difference. The Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary (Wu 1979: 431) locates the head character entry l√≠n Êûó \\"‚ë† forest; woods; grove ‚ë° circles ‚Ä¶\\" as one of 14 characters pronounced l√≠n, and alphabetically lists 17 words with l√≠n as the first syllable, for instance, l√≠nch«énp«ên Êûó‰∫ßÂìÅ \\"forest products\\", l√≠nh«éi ÊûóÊµ∑ \\"immense forest\\", and l√≠ny√® ÊûóÊ•≠ \\"forestry\\". The ABC Dictionary includes l√≠n Êûó \\"‚ë† forest; woods; grove ‚ë° forestry‚Ä¶\\" as one of 6 characters pronounced l√≠n, followed by alphabetically listed lin-initial headwords from l√≠nbƒÅ Ê∑ãÂ∑¥ \\"lymph\\" to l√≠nfƒìng Ëá®È¢® \\"facing against the wind\\", but then ling-initial words begin to appear with l√≠ng „Äá \\"zero\\", and only after another three pages will one find l√¨ngz≈´n ‰ª§Â∞ä \\"(courteous) your father\\" followed by l√≠nh«éi \\"immense forest\\" (McGinnis 1997: 568). DeFrancis' ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary is aptly described as having \\"defied the tyranny of Chinese characters\\" (Clark 2001: 387). Content The ABC Dictionary includes 5,425 different Chinese characters and a total 71,486 lexical entries. The dictionary's most notable feature is being entirely arranged by pinyin in the alphabetical order of complete compound words. For example, ku√†ngqu√°n ÁüøÊ≥â \\"mineral spring\\" immediately precedes ku√°ngqu«énb√¨ng ÁãÇÁä¨ÁóÖ \\"rabies\\", which in turn immediately precedes ku√†ngqu√°nshu«ê ÁüøÊ≥âÊ∞¥ \\"mineral water\\", even though the first and last words begin with the same character and the middle word with another (Sawer 2001: 224). The present dictionary has several titles: *ABC Dictionary (half title page 1996: i) *The ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary: Alphabetically Based Computerized‚Äîwith the last three words encircling Chinese calligraphic ÁîµËÑëÊãºÈü≥ÁºñÁ†Å [di√†nn«éo pƒ´nyƒ´n biƒÅnm«é \\"computer pinyin encoding\\"] (title page 1996: iii) *ABC (Alphabetically Based Computerized) Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary (colophon 1996: iv), *ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary Êº¢Ëã±Ë©ûÂÖ∏‚ÄßÊåâÁæÖÈ¶¨Â≠óÊØçÈ†ÜÂ∫èÊéíÂàó [H√†n-Yƒ´ng c√≠di«én ‚Äß √†n lu√≥m«é z√¨m«î sh√πnx√π p√°ili√® \\"Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary: according to alphabetically sorted romanization\\"] (front cover). The ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary comprises three main sections: an 18-page front matter, the 833-page body matter of alphabetically arranged entries, and 64-page back matter with nine appendices. The front matter includes a Table of contents; Dedication to \\"China's Staunchest Advocates of Writing Reform\\"; Editor's Call to Action; Acknowledgments; Introduction with I. Distinctive Features of the Dictionary and II. Selection and Definition of Entries; and User's Guide with I. Arrangement of Entries, II. Orthography, III. Explanatory Notes and Examples, IV. Works Consulted, and V. Abbreviations (1996: i‚Äìxix). The dictionary proper gives alphabetically arranged lexical entries and English translation equivalents, from \\"a* Âïä ' [i.e., particle] used as phrase suffix ‚ë† (in enumeration) ‚Ä¶ ‚ë° (in direct address and exclamation) ‚Ä¶ ‚ë¢ (indicating obviousness/impatience ‚Ä¶ ‚ë£ (for confirmation)\\" to \\"z√∫z≈´n ÊóèÂ∞ä ' clan seniors\\" (1996: 1 and 833, usage examples omitted). The ABC Dictionary has nine Appendices: I. Basic Rules for Hanyu Pinyin Orthography [promulgated by the State Language Commission in 1988]; II. Historical Chronology [from the Shang Dynasty c. 1700‚Äì1045 BC to the Republic of China \\"1912‚Äì1949\\" and People's Republic of China 1949‚Äì]; III. Analytic Summary of Transcription Systems [for Pinyin, Wade-Giles, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, Yale Romanization, and Zhuyin Fuhao]; IV. Wade-Giles/Pinyin Comparative Table; V. PY/WG/GR/YR/ZF Comparative Table; VI. Radical Index of Traditional Characters, Notes on Kangxi Radicals, Kangxi Radical Chart, Kangxi Radical Index; VII. Stroke Order List of Recurrent Partials; VIII. Stroke Order Index of Characters with Obscure Radicals; IX. Radical Index of Simplified Characters, with Notes on Selected CASS Radicals [viz. the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences system of 189 radicals used in dictionaries like the Xinhua Zidian], High Frequency CASS Radicals, Simplified/Traditional Radical Conversion Table, CASS Radical Chart, CASS Radical Index [for users who want to look up a Chinese logograph's pronunciation, listing the 5,425 characters appearing in the dictionary] (1996: 835‚Äì897). DeFrancis' ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary claims six lexicographical distinctions. :1. It offers the powerful advantage of arranging entries in single-sort alphabetical order as by far the simplest and fastest way to look up a term whose pronunciation is known. Alone among look- up systems, the ABC Dictionary enables users to find words seen only in transcription or heard but not seen in written form. And, since most dictionary consultation involves characters whose pronunciation is known (not just by native speakers, but also by learners beyond the very beginning level), over time the total saving in time is enormous. (Radical indexes of characters are provided for those cases where the pronunciation of a term is not known.) :2. It has been compiled with the aid of computers and lends itself to further development in electronic as well as printed form. :3. It makes use of the latest PRC lexicographical developments in respect to selection of terms and rules of orthography. :4. It utilizes frequency data from both the PRC and Taiwan to indicate the relative frequency of entries that are complete homographs (identical even as to tones) or partial homographs (identical except for tones) as an aid to student learning and computer inputting. :5. It presents a unique one-to-one correspondence between transcription and characters that permits calling up on computer the desired characters for any entry by simple uninterrupted typing of the corresponding transcription. :6. It introduces an innovative typographical format that enables its 71,486 entries (3,578 single-syllable and 68,908 multi-syllable entries) to be packed into about one-sixth less space than would be required by conventional dictionaries, while still providing greater legibility, in part thanks to larger characters. The result is a handy portable work that contains an unparalleled number of entries for its size. (1996: xi) The main source for ABC Dictionary entries is the 1989 edition of Hanyu Pinyin Cihui Ê±âË™ûÊãºÈü≥Ë©ûÊ±á \\"Hanyu Pinyin Romanized Lexicon\\", a semi-official wordlist of 60,400 entries (without definitions) compiled by members of the PRC State Language Commission. Focusing upon the needs of Western students of Chinese, DeFrancis and the editors eliminated some terms and added others. Their dictionary includes many neologisms such as d√†gƒìd√† Â§ßÂì•Â§ß \\"cellular phone\\" or d«éo(r)y√© ÂÄíÁà∑ \\"profiteer; speculator\\", as well as the modern Chinese practice of incorporating the Latin alphabet in coining Sino-alphabetic words like BP-jƒ´ BPÊú∫ \\"pager; beeper\\". In contrast to most Chinese‚ÄìEnglish dictionaries, DeFrancis' emphasizes multisyllabic c√≠ \\"words\\" rather than monosyllabic z√¨ \\"characters\\". It only includes monosyllabic character entries that are likely to be encountered as free forms or unbound morphemes (according to the Xiandai Hanyu Pinl√º Cidian Áé∞‰ª£Ê±âËØ≠È¢ëÁéáËØçÂÖ∏ \\"Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese\\"). Chinese word frequency is an important aspect of the ABC Dictionary, and it lists homophones according to their decreasing occurrence. Frequency orders are based largely on Xiandai Hanyu Pinl√º Cidian for monosyllabic entries and Zhongwen Shumianyu Pinl√º Cidian ‰∏≠Êñá‰π¶Èù¢ËØ≠È¢ëÁéáËØçÂÖ∏ \\"Dictionary of the Chinese Written Language\\" for polysyllabic words (1996: xiii). For entries with identical spelling, including tones, arrangement is by order of frequency, indicated by a superscript number before the transcription, a device adapted from Western lexicographic practice to distinguish homonyms. For example, \\"1d√†om√π ÁõúÂ¢ì ' rob graves\\" and \\"2d√†om√π ÈÅìÊú® ' railway sleeper [tie]\\". For entries that are homographic if tones are disregarded, the item of highest usage frequency is indicated by an asterisk following the transcription (see a* Âïä above), for instance, \\"l√¨gu«ê ÂéâÈ¨º ' ferocious ghost\\" and \\"l√¨gu√¨* Á´ãÊüú ' clothes-closet; wardrobe; hanging cupboard\\". While frequency information is useful for students learning vocabulary, the ABC Dictionary chiefly provides it in order to help determine the default items in computer usage. \\"Our unique combination of letters, tone marks, and raised numbers provides a simple and distinctive one-to-one correspondence between transcription and character(s) that is intended to facilitate computerized handling of the entries.\\" (1996: xiv). The ABC Dictionary format for entries is (1996: xiii): *the pinyin spelling of the word in large boldface type *the corresponding simplified Chinese characters, and for single-character entries with a contrasting traditional Chinese character, it is given in square brackets given upon the first appearance of each character/morpheme (e.g., \\"w√† Ë¢ú[Ë•™] ' socks; stockings; hose\\") *parts of speech in boldface small caps (e.g., ' verb phrase, ' onomatopoeia), which is especially useful for Western students of Chinese (e.g., \\"hu«éngh≈´ ÊÅçÊÉö ' ‚ë† absentminded ‚ë° dimly; faintly; seemingly\\") *(optional) usage environments (e.g., TW Taiwan) or registers (vulg. vulgar) in angle brackets and italics, for instance, \\"h√∫l«î ËÉ°Ëôè ' northern barbarians\\" *translation equivalents in Roman type (e.g., \\"hu√†ngdang ÊôÉËç° ' rock; shake; sway\\"); semicolons separate slightly variant meanings of entries, and circled numbers distinguish more widely different meanings (as in hu«éngh≈´ above) *(optional) example phrases and sentences in semi-bold italicized pinyin, but without characters, which users can find through alphabetic lookup, followed by English renderings in Roman type (e.g., \\"1t√≥ut√≤ng Â§¥Áóõ ' have a headache Zh√® sh√¨ zhƒìn r√†ng r√©n ~! This gives one a real headache!\\") Take the dao in Daoism for an example dictionary entry. > 2d√†o ÈÅì ‚ë† road ‚ë° channel ‚ë¢ way ‚ë£ doctrine ‚ë§ Daoism ‚ë• line ‚ô¶ ' for > rivers/topics/etc. ‚ô¶ ' ‚ë† say; speak; talk ch√°ngy√°n d√†o as the saying goes TƒÅ > shu≈ç ~: \\"...\\" He said: \\"...\\" ‚ë° think; suppose (1996: 113) This concise entry uses a superscript on d√†o to denote ÈÅì as the second most commonly occurring unbound character pronounced d√†o, gives six English translation equivalents, distinguishes syntactic uses as a measure word and a verb, and gives two characterless usage examples ch√°ngy√°n d√†o Â∏∏Ë®ÄÈÅì and TƒÅ shu≈çd√†o ‰ªñË™™ÈÅì. Reception Reviews of DeFrancis' ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary were published by major academic journals in linguistics (e.g., The Modern Language Journal), Asian studies (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society), and sinology (China Review International). Most reviewers criticized certain aspects, such as the difficulty of looking up a traditional Chinese character, but also highly evaluated the innovative dictionary. Here are three representative examples of praise: \\"the most extraordinary Chinese‚ÄìEnglish dictionary I have ever had such pleasure to look Chinese words up in and to read their English definitions\\" (Bauer 1997: 307); \\"The thorough scholarship and fresh outlook make it a valuable contribution to Chinese lexicography, while the high production standards and comprehensive coverage of the colloquial language should make it a favourite of all serious students of Modem Chinese\\" (Jensen 1998: 144); \\"This excellent one-volume Chinese‚ÄìEnglish dictionary is a crowning achievement for John DeFrancis, one of the doyens of Chinese language teaching in the United States\\" (Sawer 2001: 224). A common area of complaint involves the ABC Dictionarys treatment of traditional and simplified Chinese characters. Dictionary entries give simplified characters for headwords, and only give the traditional form upon the first appearance of each character, and in the appendices. For instance, critics say, \\"looking up characters in traditional form is a bit more trouble than it might be, you must use a special index\\" (Chung 1998: 660); and the dictionary is \\"clearly not designed to be used by anyone who does serious work with nonsimplified characters\\" (Jensen 1998: 144). One reviewer panned the ABC Dictionarys supplementary materials. For instance, saying the front matter's \\"uncommonly profuse\\" dedication and Editor's Call to Action reveal \\"no doubt that axes are being ground\\" about writing reform; the Distinctive Features of the Dictionary \\"reads like an abstract for a research grant application\\"; and describing most of the appendices as \\"a hodgepodge of pub quiz trivia\\" (Jensen 1998: 143). Several evaluations of the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary mention cases in which using the alphabetically-arranged headword entries is more efficient than using a conventionally arranged dictionary with character head entries that list words written with that character as the first. Robert S. Bauer, a linguist of Cantonese at Hong Kong Polytechnic University says the dictionary works best when users hear a word pronounced but do not know how to write it in characters, they can very quickly look it up in pinyin order and find the correct characters and meanings. However, to look up an unknown character's pronunciation and meaning, then one needs to use a radical-indexed dictionary. Bauer says \\"I have generally succeeded in finding almost all the words and expressions I have tried to look up; this I regard as quite remarkable since I cannot say the same about other dictionaries I have been consulting over my more than 25 years of working on Chinese.\\" (1997: 308). Sean Jensen says alphabetical collation is \\"truly iconoclastic\\" in the tradition-rich world of Chinese lexicography and describes experimenting with using the dictionary. > I am used to the \\"old style\\" dictionaries based on radicals, and I was > disposed to approach the ABC Dictionary with some skepticism. But having > used it for two months I have so(sic) say that it is nothing short of > wonderful! It is a pleasure to be able to use a Chinese dictionary in the > same way that one uses a French or German dictionary. The typography is > exceptionally clear, and the sheer quantity of words per page, arranged > alphabetically, has the effect of bringing the melodies of spoken Chinese > alive. (1998: 144) Michael Sawer, professor of Chinese at the University of Canberra, says using the ABC Dictionary does not make it easy to quickly find all the words beginning with the same Chinese character; but it does enable readers to easily find all those pronounced the same (disregarding tonal differences), as well as which among homophonous words is used most frequently (2001: 224). Taking a contrary view, Karen Steffen Chung, professor of Chinese at National Taiwan University, found using DeFrancis' dictionary less satisfying than traditional dictionaries, where all compounds beginning with the same character are listed together under that character head entry. Giving the circular example of a hypothetical dictionary user wanting to find all the compounds beginning with sh√≠ ÂØ¶ \\"to realize\\", which is certainly easier with a customary Chinese dictionary than with the ABC, Chung says that the alphabetic arrangement is unfortunately \\"its biggest drawback\\", and while \\"this may reflect an ideal of treating Chinese primarily as a spoken rather than written language, it also goes against native habit and intuition.\\" (1998: 660). Scott McGinnis, professor of Chinese at the University of Maryland, explains that users of the ABC Dictionary who are already familiar with written Chinese and dictionaries organized by character headings must \\"forget\\" what they know about the Mandarin syllabic inventory and focus strictly on the spelling. For some dictionary users, purely pinyin-dependent sequencing such as cuƒÅnzi Èï©Â≠ê \\"ice pick\\" to c≈´b√†o Á≤óÊö¥ \\"rude; rough; crude\\" and n«éngsh√≠ Êõ©Êó∂ \\"(written) in olden days; of yore\\" to n√°nguƒÅ ÂçóÁìú \\"pumpkin\\" \\"may be at least initially confusing\\" (1997: 568). Jan W. Walls, professor of Chinese language and culture at Simon Fraser University, describes some minor oversights in the dictionary such as the \\"dƒ´sh√¨ ÁöÑÂ£´ taxi\\" entry, which might imply the borrowing came directly from English, when it actually is a loanword from Cantonese dik1 si6 ÁöÑÂ£´ transcribing taxi. But this is a minor point, \\"merely meizhong-buzu Áæé‰∏≠‰∏çË∂≥ (defined in ABC as \\"blemish in sth. otherwise perfect\\") that should not detract from the great value of this important work ‚Ä¶ which is quite likely to become a standard reference work for English-speaking students of Mandarin, and to remain so for quite some time.\\" (1998: 113‚Äì114). The expanded 2003 ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Comprehensive Dictionary had fewer academic reviews than the 1996 ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary. Michael Sawer, who also reviewed the original ABC Dictionary, calls this comprehensive dictionary an \\"outstanding contribution to the field, in many ways better than other comparable dictionaries\\" (2004: 313). He makes comparisons between the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Comprehensive Dictionary (called \\"ABC\\") and two bilingual dictionaries aimed more at native speakers of Chinese who are learning English: the Han-Ying Da Cidian (Wu 1993, \\"CED\\" Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary) and Xiandai Hanyu Cidian: Han-Ying Shuangyu (CASSIL 2002, \\"CCD\\" Contemporary Chinese Dictionary). The 2003 ABC, like the 1996 first edition, is arranged in strict single-sort alphabetical order, while both the CED and CCD are in double-sort alphabetic order‚Äîthat is, the first syllables of each word are arranged in alphabetic order, and then within each tone category in order of different characters. Take for instance, dictionary users wanting to look up y√¨shi ÊÑèËØÜ \\"consciousness; mentality\\". A user who knows the pronunciation begins with y√¨ can search (in ascending number of strokes) through some eighty characters pronounced y√¨ before finding ÊÑè, and then ÊÑèËØÜ; or a user who knows that y√¨shi is written ÊÑèËØÜ can find ÊÑè in the radical index, under the \\"heart radical\\" ÂøÉ, then the 9 remaining strokes in Èü≥, and find the page number for the ÊÑè head entry (Sawer 2004: 310). A great advantage of ABC is that you can immediately look up a word you have heard but whose exact tone, meaning, and characters are unknown to you. For yishi in all tonal combinations, this dictionary gives 46 different words, with ÊÑèËØÜ easily found. What an ABC user cannot straightforwardly see (which of course they can in the other two dictionaries) is all the words listed beginning with y√¨ ÊÑè. ABC gives grammatical information with around 30 tags, including both parts of speech (\\"V.\\" for verb) and other tags (\\"ID.\\" for idiom). CED provides just 11 grammatical tags, while CCD only marks numerals and classifiers. The comprehensive grammatical tags in ABC are \\"a most valuable feature\\", especially for learners of Chinese, and many words have more than one grammatical function (e.g., xu√©x√≠ Â≠¶‰π† [Â≠∏Áøí] ' study; learn; emulate ‚óÜ ' learning\\"). Another useful ABC grammatical tag is B.F. for \\"bound form\\" (as opposed to free form words, mentioned above), but this distinction is not usually indicated in PRC dictionaries such as CED and CCD (Sawer 2004: 311). Proper nouns receive a particularly ample treatment in ABC (especially compared with CED and CCD). These include people's names (e.g., some 15 beginning with the surname L«ê Êùé, ranging from the famous poet Li Bai to the former PRC President Li Xiannian), names of automobiles (like Xi√†l√¨ Â§èÂà© \\"Charade\\"), and many toponyms (Xi√†wƒìiy√≠ Â§èÂ®ÅÂ§∑ \\"Hawaii\\", spelled with the  ªokina) (Sawer 2004: 312). Yanfang Tang, professor of Chinese at the College of William and Mary, says the ABC Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Comprehensive Dictionary \\"stands above its peers as one of the most comprehensive, informative, and useful tools in the study of and dealing with the Chinese language\\" (2005: 145). This dictionary is a valuable asset for several types of users. Native speakers will particularly benefit from the \\"authentic and accurate English translations\\" of Chinese words and phrases, which are an improvement over sometimes \\"stiff and awkward\\" translations in previous Chinese‚ÄìEnglish dictionaries, which were edited predominantly by Anglophone native speakers of Chinese. Chinese‚ÄìEnglish translators, students of Chinese as a foreign language, and compilers of Chinese language textbooks will find this dictionary indispensable for providing comprehensive linguistic information. Nonnative speakers of Chinese will find the dictionary handy to use, and those who are accustomed to alphabets will find locating a Chinese word in this alphabetically arranged dictionary \\"almost an act of second nature\\". Advanced learners of Chinese who have a firm command of pinyin will also benefit, especially in cases when they know how to pronounce a word but do not remember how to write it, and will be able to quickly find the character (2005: 145). Tang suggests an improvement for future ABC Dictionary editions. Users who want to look up an unfamiliar character may find the layout of Stroke-Order Index and Radical Index to be \\"awkward, inconvenient, and time-consuming\\" because after looking the character up, the index gives the pinyin pronunciation instead of the page (2005: 146).

In the book, Hartman argues for literary criticism to be taken as seriously as a form of creative literature in its own right, and he discusses the difficulties that literature professors face in the contemporary American university. Overview Hartman contends that works like Jacques Derrida's Glas, Norman O. Brown's Closing Time, Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Biographia Literaria represent a current of literary criticism that is as creative and idiosyncratic as the canonical works that critics have historically studied and written about. Hartman also examines the professional dilemmas of literature professors, who despite their subversive sympathies, must accept that their college teaching places them in the position of educating students whose literary education polishes them to take leadership roles in power networks that are opposed to the values the professors hope to inculcate. A second edition of the book, with a foreword by Hayden White, was published by Yale University Press in 2007. Reception Criticism in the Wilderness was widely reviewed in the academic press, and received largely positive and admiring assessments. Harriet Ritvo, writing in The Threepenny Review, gave high praise for the book: > Hartman flatly rejects the distinction between literature and criticism. > Instead, he asserts that both are kinds of \\"writing.\\" Throughout the volume, > he alternates between analysis or \\"reading\\" of conventionally literary works > and of criticism with no apparent alteration of method: in one chapter, for > example, he discusses his colleague Harold Bloom right alongside Thomas > Carlyle. He acknowledges that most criticism is secondary in the sense that > it is about other writing, but he firmly resists the inference that this > necessarily makes it inferior. As a result, reading‚Äîthe work of > critics‚Äîbecomes a heroically strenuous activity. Instead of a respectful > effort to divine and interpret the author's intentions, it is a struggle > between author and reader-critic for control of the work. The results > include greatly expanded opportunities for critical pyrotechnics‚Äîand some of > Hartman's are breathtaking. Alexander Argyros and Jerry Aline Flieger reviewed Criticism in the Wilderness in Diacritics, and were positive in their assessment. They stated: \\"Hartman's work is above all, a polemics of style, the stylist's manifesto, an assertion of the critic's right to a literary style, along with the corollary repudiation of the dream of a 'pure' language 'that no longer mixes images and meanings.'\\" James Mall, writing in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, questioned why Hartman did not write the kind of context-breaking critical work that Criticism in the Wilderness celebrates: \\"Hartman's energetic plea for the right to engage in a more personal, 'creative criticism' is needless. The form of writing he defends is certainly not revolutionary, as his own comments on Carlyle, Emerson, Valery, Derrida, and Bloom indicate. Why, then, has he not written the kind of book he claims to wish to write?\\" Richard Boyd Hauck, reviewing Criticism in the Wilderness in Modern Fiction Studies, wrote that \\"the advanced student can find some rare things here: an essay on literary commentary as literature, an analysis of the psychology of the critic, a chapter on the history of practical criticism, an admiring defense against (not attack upon) T. S. Eliot, an interesting discussion of how Walter Benjamin took criticism out of the world of art into 'all sectors of daily life,' and some expansions upon Harold Bloom's 'insights.'\\" A.D. Nuttall, writing in The Modern Language Review, said: \\"Professor Hartman knows a great deal and writes very elegantly, with a sort of brilliant vagueness which arises, curiously enough, from firm critical principle. The principle is the Romantic theorem that literature is a mystery which is profaned by explanation or paraphrase.\\" Susan Handelman, reviewing the book in The Wordsworth Circle, gave the following appraisal: \\"Hartman's book is, above all, a passionate reassertion of the authority and creativity of the critic, an argument for a broad 'philosophical criticism,' whose relation to art is, in his words, 'symbiotic' not 'parasitic.'\\" Peter Rudnytsky in World Literature Today wrote that Criticism in the Wilderness, as \\"an unqualified triumph both of speculation and close reading, is itself that 'demonstration of freedom' which, according to Geoffrey Hartman, each 'work of art' and 'work of reading' may potentially be. Succeeding brilliantly in the critic's double task of responding to 'the extraordinary language-event' while yet maintaining 'a prose of the center,' Hartman returns us 'to a larger and darker view of art as mental charm, war, and purgation.'\\" Daniel Hughes in MLN wrote that \\"[o]ne of the strengths of Hartman's work has always been the depth of his understanding and the generosity of his response to other critics. He works through and around them, saving what suits him and even praising what he cannot accept....\\" Richard Levin reviewed Criticism in the Wilderness in Modern Philology, and wrote that \\"[i]t is in many respects a very impressive achievement‚Äîprodigiously learned, deeply engaged, charged with energy and excitement, and written in a finely honed and often eloquent style. It is also a very difficult book which makes few concessions to its readers.\\" Sarah Lawall, reviewing the book in Comparative Literature, wrote that \\"it is clear from Criticism in the Wilderness that Hartman (especially in the three 'polemical pieces' at the end) sees himself as the herald of a contemporary humanistic re-vision blending analytical and creative consciousness, the English-American and continental European heritage.\\" Lawall went on to say that > the great merit of this study is the way it moves from illustrating the > contingent nature of reading (the modeled \\"work of reading\\") to an > understanding of the creative consciousness as that which gives us identity, > situates us in time and culture. Hartman's reading itself is exemplary: that > is, it is an example of a truly responsive reading of literary and critical > texts related to the problem of individual human understanding.\\" Shuli Barzilai and Morton Bloomfield in New Literary History wrote that \\"[t]he act of writing itself, the 'question of critical style,' is one of the main polemical concerns of Geoffrey Hartman's Criticism in the Wilderness. In his essays Hartman repeatedly inveighs not only against the subordination of criticism to literature, but also against the tedium of a stylistic decorum which reduces criticism to the level of formal conversation.\\" See also * Geoffrey Hartman * Yale school References Sources       * * Category:1980 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books of literary criticism ","title":"Criticism in the Wilderness"},{"id":"51898781","text":"Dendrobium delacourii is a member of the family Orchidaceae.

Following their involvement in the early battles of the war, several of their number were appointed to senior positions in the British military establishment. Formation Shortly after departure of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) for France on 7 August 1914, the War Office made a request to the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), that twenty-five suitable members, together with their own vehicles, make themselves available to the General Headquarters at the front. Volunteers were interviewed and their cars inspected by the RAC themselves under the direction of the club secretary, Julian Orde. Once accepted, the volunteers were told to obtain an officer's khaki Service Dress uniform (without badges) and whatever else they thought they might need, and to present themselves at Southampton Docks for embarkation on 21 August.Rawlinson pp. 5-6 The only equipment issued by the RAC was a brassard, described by one volunteer as \\"somewhat pretentious\\";Rawlinson p. 7 however, the War Office undertook to provide a daily allowance of 10 French Francs, as well as rations and petrol. Service The volunteers and their cars arrived in Le Havre on 22 August aboard SS Gloucester Castle. They drove in convoy as far as Amiens where they met Major-General Frederick Robb, the Inspector-General of Lines of Communications. The volunteers were appointed to various corps and divisional headquarters of the BEF, while 6 of them were selected to go to the BEF's General Headquarters which were then located at Le Cateau.Rawlinson p. 15 The volunteers served with distinction during the Retreat from Mons, the First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of Ypres, ferrying around staff officers and dispatches under the most dangerous conditions.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and barrel-shaped, urn-shaped or shortened spherical fruit. Description Corymbia petalophylla is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thick, rough, yellowish, tessellated and flaky bark on the trunk and branches, smooth bark only on the thinnest branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with an operculum that is rounded with a central knob or conical. Flowering occurs from July to September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped, urn- shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming This bloodwood was first formally described in 1991 by Ian Brooker and Anthony Bean who gave it the name Eucalyptus petalophylla and published the description in the journal Austrobaileya. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia petalophylla. The specific epithet (petalophylla) is from Greek words meaning \\"broad\\" and \\"leaf\\", referring to the broad juvenile leaves.

News about events like this one contributed to train anxiety The fear of trains is anxiety and fear associated with trains, railways, and railway travel. Psychoanalysis Psychonalysts, starting from Freud himself, associated sensations towards travel by train with sexuality. In 1906 Freud wrote that the link of railway travel and sexuality derives from the pleasurable sensation of shaking during the travel. Therefore, in the event of repression of sexuality the person will experience anxiety when confronted with railway travel.Wilhelm Stekel, Nerv√∂se Angstzust√§nde und ihre Behandlung; citing Freud in German, pp. 191-198Wolfgang Schivelbusch, The Railway Journey: The Industrialization of Time and Space in the 19th Century, p. 78, citing Sigmund Freud as translated in English, \\"The Complete Psychological Work\\" Karl Abraham interpreted the fear of the uncontrollable motion of a train as a projection of the fear of uncontrolled sexuality. Wilhelm Stekel (1908) also associated train phobia with rocking sensation, but in addition to libido repression, he associated it with the embarrassment with the reminiscences of the rocking sensation of the early childhood. Other considerations Freud himself was suffering a kind of train anxiety, as he confessed in a number of letters.Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, Volumes 16-18, p. 73 He used the term \\"Reiseangst\\" for it, which literally means \\"fear of travel\\" but it was recognized it was primarily associated with the travel by train,Paul C. Vitz, Sigmund Freud's Christian Unconscious, . 25 and some translators translated Freud's \\"Reiseangst\\" as \\"railroad phobia\\" However Freud's anxiety was not a \\"true\\" phobia, since one the travel started, the anxiety disappeared, and in fact Freud traveled much and liked it. Regardless of sexuality, since early days various authors associated the uncontrollable motion of the train with the fear of derailment, of a catastrophe. Another source of fear in the early days of railway travel was travellers' isolation from the outside world, as well as the confinement in a small compartment, rendering a person who became sick or subject to crime, helpless. \\"...The loudest screams are swallowed up by the roar of the rapidly revolving wheels...\\".As cited by W. Schivelbusch, p. 79 This kind of fear, as well as actual crimes committed in trains, were often a matter of newspaper publications of the times.W. Schivelbusch, pp. 79-83 After a number of prominent cases this fear was elevated to the level of collective psychosis.W. Schivelbusch, p. 83 Public fear about rail travel was heightened after British surgeon John Eric Erichsen described a post-traumatic diagnosis known as railway spine or \\"Erichsen's disease\\". People diagnosed with this had no obvious injury and were rejected as fake. Nowadays it is known that traffic accidents may cause posttraumatic stress disorder.Keller T., Chappell T., \\"The rise and fall of Erichsen's disease (railroad spine)\\" Alternative names and etymology It has been variously called as \\"train phobia\\", \\"railroad phobia\\", \\"dread of railway travel\\", etc. The German term \\"Eisenbahnangst\\" used, e.g., by Sigmund Freud was literally converted into Greek as \\"siderodromophobia\\" (Eisen = sideron = iron, Bahn = dromos = way, Angst = phobos = fear).Otto Dornbl√ºth, Klinisches W√∂rterbuch. 1927. In cases when this anxiety exceeds the social norms of a realistic fear, this anxiety may be classified as a specific phobia about trains.Aaron T. Beck, Gary Emery, Ruth L. Greenberg, Anxiety Disorders and Phobias: A Cognitive Perspective, 2005, , p. 30 Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary puts fear of trains under the \\"vehicle phobia\\", together with fears of boats, airplanes, automobiles, and other forms of transportation.Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary, pp. 1022-1023 Cultural references A 1913 short story Terror by Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki is a first- person narrative of a young man suffering of the morbid fear of travel in trains and streetcars.

It is known for its cold brew coffee and is credited as the first fair trade and organic cold brew company in the United States. In 2014, Chameleon Cold-Brew was given the Best Coffee award by BevNET. History Chameleon Cold-Brew was founded in 2010 by Steve Williams and Chris Campbell. Williams, a longtime coffee industry professional and coffee shop owner, created a unique blend of cold brew coffee to sell exclusively at his east Austin coffeehouse, Bennu Coffee. Campbell, who holds an MBA from Rice University, was working as a business consultant when he and Williams met at a neighborhood barbecue. The pair decided to join forces, utilizing Campbell's entrepreneurial ambitions and Williams‚Äô coffee expertise, to bottle and sell a cold brew brand based on the original recipe served at Bennu Coffee. The pair teamed with Austin coffee icon and master roaster, R.C. Beall, to perfect the cold brew blend using beans from Beall's coffee sourcing company, Texas Coffee Traders. After months of experimenting with various brewing methods, beans and water sources, the recipe was finalized and Chameleon Cold-Brew debuted its first products in the Austin market in 2011 at a south Austin convenient store, The Whip In. The original cold brew recipe is still freshly brewed and served at Bennu Coffee's two Austin locations. Chameleon Cold-Brew was able to gain traction in the marketplace by cutting deals with local vendors such as Texafrance who bottled the product for the company. By 2012, the company had its products in 225 stores in 18 states. The company received outside funding in 2013 by selling a minority stake in the company to Fortitude Capital LLC. Funding was used for product distribution, marketing, and infrastructure. It expanded to selling its products to natural and specialty retailers, including Wegmans and H-E-B, including distributing to reach six of Whole Foods Market regions. Chameleon Cold-Brew was approached by Target Corporation to sell its products. The company originally turned down the offer from Target as it did not want to risk going into mass too soon. It eventually agreed to a test distribution for 81 Target stores in Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Louisiana. In 2014, Chameleon Cold-Brew was given the Best Coffee award by BevNET. In 2015, Chameleon Cold-Brew expanded its distribution with Target to 520-plus stores throughout the United States. That same year, it raised $4 million of a $4.5 million funding round. Funding was reported to be used to expand distribution and research and development. In November 2017, Nestle S.A., the world's largest food and drinks company, acquired a majority stake of Chameleon Cold Brew for an undisclosed sum, roping the Austin, Texas-based brand into its widening coffee portfolio and further positioning the food and beverage conglomerate to challenge and disrupt the U.S. ready-to-drink (RTD) market. Products Bottles of Chameleon Cold-Brew. Chameleon Cold-Brew offers ready to drink cold brew coffee. Its cold-brew coffee also comes in concentrate that can be made into cold brew coffee by adding water, milk or other liquids. Its products are made through a 16-hour brewing process that uses only fair trade, organic coffee, and limestone cured Texas Hill Country water for the brewing process. Its products are available in three main flavors; black, mocha, and vanilla. In 2015 it introduced three new ready-to-drink flavors (espresso, chicory and Mexican), which started as exclusives to Wholesale Foods Market. Other concentrate flavors that have been introduced are Caramel, Mocha and Texas Pecan. In 2016, Chameleon released its one-gallon bag-in-box black concentrate sold regionally.

It arose from Ikeda's perception that access to high-quality live music performances was beyond the reach of the majority of Japanese people. \\"Min-On\\" is an abbreviation of \\"Minshu Ongaku\\" or \\"Music for the People\\". The association began with a series of subscription concerts and became a foundation in 1965. Ikeda's other goal for Min-On was to promote cross- cultural understanding through music, and to that end the association also began a series of exchanges which introduced performing artists from other countries to Japanese audiences and sent Japanese artists abroad. In its early years, the organization was sometimes dismissed as sectarian. However, according to its past president Hiroyasu Kobayashi, that perception began to change in 1981 when Min-On underwrote a tour by Milan's La Scala opera company, one of the first Western opera companies to perform in Japan. In 1997, the Min-On Cultural Center was opened in downtown Tokyo and now houses the organization's offices as well as its music museum and library. By the end of the 1990s Min-On had organized 70,000 concerts with performers from 100 different countries and attended by over 100 million people in Japan. Activities Min-On's three main activities are its concerts, the Tokyo International Music Competition, and its music museum and library. However, it also runs the Min-On Music Research Institute, organizes lectures and conferences on music, and publishes books and monographs. =Concerts= Min- On's concert performances are held not only in the concert halls of major Japanese cities but also in small towns in the Japanese hinterland. The concerts present a wide range of styles and genres including European and Chinese opera, ballet, and indigenous folk music. In the late 1960s Min-On began its World Ballet Series which brought tours by the American Ballet Theatre and The Royal Ballet to Japan. In 1968 its also brought the Los Angeles Philharmonic to Japan for a three-week concert tour. The La Scala tour of 1981 was described by The New York Times as \\"the cultural event of the year in Japan.\\" The company gave 24 performances in Tokyo, Osaka and Yokohama with all performances televised by NHK. There were also two chamber music concerts by the La Scala Octet. Other classical performers who have appeared in Japan under the auspices of Min-On include the singers Pl√°cido Domingo, Roberto Alagna, and Charlotte de Rothschild and the Brazilian pianist Amaral Vieira who has made multiple tours for Min-On since the early 1990s. The Min-On Festival of Contemporary Music ran from 1969 to 1990 in conjunction with the Tokyo International Music Competition. The concerts were given at the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan concert hall and presented contemporary works by Japanese composers, several of them commissioned by the association. Recordings of the festival concerts given between 1979 and 1988 were released on the Japanese label Camerata. Min-On's annual Tango Concert Series, a long-running cultural exchange program between Japan and Argentina, began in 1970 began with a tour by the orchestra of and the singers Alfredo Belusi and Carlos Rossi. In 2011 Jamaica became the 104th country to tour Japan under the auspices Min-On. The tour was the second in Min-On's Caribbean Musical Cruise series. The series began in 2009 with a tour of artists from Trinidad and Tobago. =Tokyo International Music Competition= Min-On established the Tokyo International Music Competition in 1966 as a competition for singers. A category for chamber ensembles was introduced in 1974. However, the longest running of the categories has been the conducting competition which began in 1967 and is held every three years. Two of the past first prize winners, Yukinori Tezuka (1967) and Kazuhiro Koizumi (1970) became conductors of the New Japan Philharmonic. Olivier Grangean, who won the 1991 competition, later became music director of the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia. No first prizes were awarded for the 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012 competitions. In 2015, the first prize was awarded to the Spanish conductor . =Music museum and library= Min-On's music museum has collections of pianos, music boxes, and ethnic musical instruments from a variety of cultures. The piano collection includes an Anton Walter piano from the early 1780s as well the piano used for 30 years by the jazz musician Herbie Hancock who donated it to the museum. As of 2006, the library held 30,000 books, 45,000 volumes of sheet music, 200 magazine titles, and a large collection of piano rolls. It also holds thousands of photographs and audio and video recordings.

As of July 2017, there were 446 species on the official list. Between when that list was published and July 2020, three additional species have been documented through eBird. Of the 449 species, 155 are considered accidental, 13 of which are further considered hypothetical. Six species were introduced to the state, three are extinct, and one which is listed as extirpated might also be extinct. Birds that are considered probable escapees, although they may have been sighted flying free, are not included. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following status codes have been used to annotate some species: *(A) Accidental - species for which the BRC requests documentation *(H) Hypothetical - species with acceptable documentation but no physical evidence *(I) Introduced - a species that has been introduced to Alabama by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly *(E) Extinct - a recent bird that no longer exists Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive, making them difficult to observe. Most have strong legs with long toes, short rounded wings, and are weak fliers. *Clapper rail, Rallus crepitans *King rail, Rallus elegans *Virginia rail, Rallus limicola *Sora, Porzana carolina *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *American coot, Fulica americana *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus *Yellow rail, Coturnicops noveboracensis (A) *Black rail, Laterallus jamaicensis (A) Limpkin Order: GruiformesFamily: Aramidae The limpkin is an odd bird that looks like a large rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes with some trees or scrub in the Caribbean, South America and southern Alabama. *Limpkin, Aramus guarauna (A) Cranes Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, tall birds with long legs and long necks. Unlike the similar-looking but un-related herons, cranes fly with necks extended. Most have elaborate and noisy courtship displays or \\"dances\\". When in a group, they may also \\"dance\\" for no particular reason, jumping up and down in an elegant manner, seemingly just for pleasure or to attract a mate. *Sandhill crane, Antigone canadensis *Whooping crane, Grus americana (A) (H) Stilts and avocets Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the avocets and stilts.

Most eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or sand. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. *Upland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus *Long- billed curlew, Numenius americanus (A) *Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica (A) *Marbled godwit, Limosa fedoa *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres *Red knot, Calidris canutus *Ruff, Calidris pugnax (A) *Sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata (A) *Stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus *Curlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea (A) *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Dunlin, Calidris alpina *Purple sandpiper, Calidris maritima (A) *Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii *Least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla *White-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis *Buff-breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos *Semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla *Western sandpiper, Calidris mauri *Short-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus *Long-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus scolopaceus *Eurasian woodcock, Scolopax rusticola (A) (H) *American woodcock, Scolopax minor *Wilson's snipe, Gallinago delicata *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularia *Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria *Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes *Willet, Tringa semipalmata *Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca *Wilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor *Red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus (A) *Red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius (A) Skuas and jaegers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae Skuas and jaegers are medium to large seabirds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers. *Pomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus (A) *Parasitic jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus (A) *Long-tailed jaeger, Stercorarius longicaudus (A) Auks, murres, and puffins Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Alcidae Alcids are superficially similar to penguins due to their black-and-white colors, their upright posture, and some of their habits; however they are not closely related to penguins and are (with one extinct exception) able to fly. Auks live on the open sea, only deliberately coming ashore to breed. *Razorbill, Alca torda (A) Gulls, terns, and skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae The Laridae are a family of medium to large seabirds and containing the gulls, terns, kittiwakes, and skimmers.

Their long wings have black markings, as does the head. *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaeton aethereus (A) Loons Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons are aquatic birds the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. *Red-throated loon, Gavia stellata (A) *Pacific loon, Gavia pacifica (A) *Common loon, Gavia immer Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, these three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm- petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. *Leach's storm- petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous (A) *Band-rumped storm-petrel, Hydrobates castro (A) Petrels and shearwaters Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united tubular nostrils with a median septum. *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea (A) *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus (A) *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis (A) *Audubon's shearwater, Puffinus lherminieri (A) Storks Order: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae Storks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long stout bills and wide wingspans.

Early life Harmsworth was born in May 1876 in St John's Wood, London, the son of Alfred Harmsworth (1837‚Äì1889), a barrister, and his wife, Geraldine Mary Maffett. His elder brothers were Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, Cecil Harmsworth, 1st Baron Harmsworth, Sir Leicester Harmsworth, 1st Baronet, and Sir Hildebrand Harmsworth, 1st Baronet. He graduated from Christ Church, Oxford, with a BA and was a director of the Amalgamated Press (founded by his brother, Alfred). He was a member of the Sylvan Debating Club, which was founded by his father. Career At the age of 27, when travelling in the south of France, Harmsworth met Dr Louis Perrier, a local doctor, who had bought a spring in 1898 in nearby Verg√®ze, and was operating a commercial spa and bottling the water for sale. Perrier was in dire need of investment, and showed Harmsworth the spring, which he then bought into, becoming the sole owner within two years, selling his share in the Daily Mail to raise the funds. He closed the spa and focused on bottling the water, renaming the spring Source Perrier. Perrier water In 1906, he was injured in a motor accident on the Great North Road, near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, when his chauffeur missed the road in the darkness whilst travelling at high speed; Harmsworth was paralysed from the waist down for the rest of his life. He based the shape of the distinctive bulbous green Perrier bottle, which he designed, on the Indian clubs that he used for exercise following his accident. The Perrier sparkling mineral water was a great success across the British Empire, and in 1905, Harmsworth received a Royal Warrant. At that time, the water was \\"better known in London, Delhi and Singapore than in Paris\\".Perrier. Nestle. Retrieved 10 November 2016. Personal life Harmsworth's house, Les Bouillens, which was next to the Perrier factory, is now a museum about the Perrier brand.

It is believed to have been composed around 1191-1192 CE by Jayanaka, a Kashmiri poet-historian in the court of Prithviraja. Some portions of the poem are now lost. Besides Prithviraja's biography, the poem also gives an account of his ancestors.  Manuscript  The only known manuscript of Prithviraja Vijaya is a birch bark manuscript written in Sharada script. It was discovered by Georg B√ºhler in 1875, when he was searching for Sanskrit manuscripts in Kashmir. The manuscript is highly mutilated, and several parts of the text (including the author's name) are missing from it.  Authorship  Although the author's name is missing from the manuscript, Har Bilas Sarda theorized that the text was composed by Jayanaka, who was a court-poet of Prithviraja. This theory is based on the following points: * Canto 12 of the poem records the entry of the Kashmiri poet Jayanaka in Prithviraja's court * In Canto 1, Prithviraja is expected to listen to the poem. This indicates that the poem was composed by one of his court-poets. * The author appears to have been a Kashmiri Pandit:  The poetic style closely resembles that of the 11th century Kashmiri poet Bilhana  The mangalacharan (prayer) and criticism of other poets at the beginning of the text match the ones in Bilhana's Vikramanka-Deva-Charita (another eulogistic poem, on the life of Vikramaditya VI).  The poem praises Kashmir in Canto 12  The Kashmiri scholar Jonaraja wrote a commentary on the text  The only contemporary known to have quoted the poem was Jayaratha, also a Kashmiri.  The manuscript was discovered in Kashmir  Date of composition  The poem is quoted by the Kashmiri scholar Jayaratha in his Vimarshini (c. 1200 CE), so it was definitely composed before this date. The poem mentions Prithviraja's victory over Muhammad of Ghor in the first Battle of Tarain, but does not cover his defeat in the second battle. This indicates that it was most probably written during 1191-1192 CE, in the period between the two battles. Thus, Prithviraja Vijaya is the only extant literary text from the reign of Prithviraja.  Content  = Canto 1 = The first canto praises the ancient poets Valmiki, Vyasa and Bhasa. It also mentions the contemporary poets Krishna and Vishvaroopa. The poem eulogizes Vishvaroopa, a native of Ajmer, and a friend and guide of the author. The poem then praises the king, Prithviraja III, who greatly honoured the poet. It mentions that Prithviraja had shown a promise of future greatness during his childhood. It also mentions that the king was proficient in six languages. Next, the poem describes Pushkar, the place of the poet's residence, and a town near the Chahamana capital Ajmer. It states that Ajagandha Mahadeva, a temple dedicated to Shiva, was located at Pushkar. In the poem, Brahma tells Vishnu that originally, there were three yajna-kundas (sacrificial fire pits) at the site, which eventually became lakes. Brahma requests Vishnu to take birth on the earth to \\"rectify the Muslim desecration of Pushkar\\", and as a result Prithviraja - whom the text identifies as a form of Vishnu - is born. = Canto 2 = Chahamana, the founder of Prithviraja's dynasty, emerged from the orbit of the sun. He was thus a member of the legendary solar dynasty. His brother Dhananjaya served as his commander-in- chief. King Vasudeva was born in Chahamana's lineage. = Canto 3-4 = The Sambhar Salt Lake During a hunting expedition in a forest, Vasudeva found a magic pill and restored it to its owner, a vidyadhara (supernatural being). The pleased vidyadhara told him that the goddess Parvati resided in the forest under the name Shakambhari. He also magically conjured up a salt lake (the Sambhar Salt Lake). He told Vasudeva that this lake would always remain in the possession of the king's family, protected by Shakambhari and Ashapuri (the king's family deity). = Canto 5 = A genealogy of Prithviraja's ancestors is given: The canto also briefly describes the reigns of some of the early Chahamana rulers: * The sister of Govindaraja II (alias Guvaka II) had twelve suitors, but she married the king of Kanyakubja (Kannauj). He defeated the other suitors, and gave their wealth to his sister. * Chandanaraja's queen Rudrani, also called Atmaprabha or Yogini, installed 1000 Shiva lingams on the banks of the Pushkar lake. These lingams were like lamps that removed darkness. * Vakpatiraja I won 188 battles, and constructed a Shiva temple at Pushkar. * Vigraharaja II defeated Mularaja, the king of Gujarat, who had to flee to Kantha-durga (Kanthkot). Vigraharaja built a temple of the goddess Ashapuri on the banks of the river Rewa (Narmada). * Vakpatiraja II killed Amba-Prasada, the ruler of Aghat. * Viryarama was killed by Bhoja of Malwa. * Chamundaraja erected a Vishnu temple at Narpur (Narwar). * Durlabharaja III died in a battle against the Matangas (Muslims). * Vigraharaja II gave a horse named Saranga to Udayaditya of Malwa. With help of this horse, Udayaditya defeated the king of Gujarat. * Prithviraja I killed 700 Chaulukyas who had come to rob the Brahmins in Pushkar. He also set up a charitable institution on the road to Somnath. * Ajayaraja II (alias Salhana) defeated the Muslims as well as Sulhana, the king of Malwa. He filled the world with silver coins, and his queen Somalekha was used to freshly minted coins every day. The queen built a stepwell in front of a temple. Ajayaraja II established the town of Ajayameru (Ajmer), which was full of temples and rightly deserved to be called Meru. The poem goes on to eulogize Ajayameru. For example, it states that the legendary great cities like Lanka and Dvaraka were not fit even for the maidservants of Ajayameru. = Canto 6 = Ana Sagar, the lake commissioned by Arnoraja Arnoraja defeated the Muslim invaders, many of whom were killed by the heroes of Ajayameru. To celebrate the victory, the king commissioned a lake, and filled it with the water of the Chandra river (now called Bandi river). He also built a Shiva temple, and named it after his father Ajayaraja (now called the Ajaypal Temple). Arnoraja had two wives: Sudhava of Avichi (Marwar), and Kanchanadevi (the daughter of Jayasimha Siddharaja of Gujarat). Arnoraja and Sudhava had three sons, who were as different as the three gunas (qualities). Of these, Vigraharaja IV was like the sattva guna (good qualities). The eldest son (Jagaddeva, not named in the text) rendered the same service to Arnoraja as Bhrigu's son did to his mother (that is, killed his parent). This son went out like a wick, leaving behind an evil smell. Someshvara was the son of Arnoraja and Kanchandevi. Astrologers predicted that Someshvara's son (that is, Prithviraja III) would be an incarnation of the legendary divine hero Rama. Therefore, Jayasimha took Someshvara to his own court in Gujarat. The poem then describes the legendary lunar dynasty, including Soma, Budha, Paurava and Bharata as its members. A portion of the manuscript is missing after these verses. Next, the poem describes the legendary king Kartavirya, and states that the Kalachuris of Tripuri (the family of Prithviraja's mother) were descended from him through one Sahasikh (\\"courageous\\"). = Canto 7 = The poem states that Jayasimha Siddharaja (the maternal grandfather of Prithviraja III) was an incarnation of Shiva's devotee Kumbodhar. His successor Kumarapala (literally \\"protector of a child\\") kept a young Someshvara close to himself, and thus became worthy of his name. When Someshvara grew up, he beheaded the king of Konkana during Kumarapala's invasion of that region. Someshvara married Karpura-devi, the princess of Tripuri. The text then states that Prithviraja was born on the 8th day of the jyeshtha month. It states the planetary positions at the time of his birth, although some portions are missing from the only available manuscript. = Canto 8 = The birth of Prithviraja was celebrated with many festivities. A wet nurse was appointed for his care. To protect him, a tiger's claw and images of Vishnu's ten incarnations were attached to his necklace. The queen became pregnant again, and gave birth to Hariraja in the Magha month. Vigraharaja IV died a happy man after hearing that the earth had been blessed with the two sons of his brother. The phrase \\"the friend of poets\\" disappeared with his death. His unmarried son Aparagangeya also died. Prithvibhata, the son of Sudhava's eldest son, also departed, as if to bring back Vigraharaja. The males were dropping like pearls from the line of Sudhava. Lakshmi (the goddess of fortune) left Sudhava's lineage, and wished to see Someshvara (Prithviraja's father). Therefore, the Chahamana ministers brought Someshvara to Sapadalaksha (the Chahamana country). Someshvara and Karpura-devi came to Ajayameru with their two sons, Prithviraja and Hariraja. Someshvara became the new Chahamana king, and established a new town where the palaces of Vigraharaja were located. He named this new town after his father Arnoraja, to remove the blot left by killing of Arnoraja by his eldest son. In Ajayameru, Vigraharaja had constructed as many temples as the hill forts he had conquered. In the middle of these temples, Someshvara erected the Vaidyanath (Shiva) temple, which was taller than all of Vigraharaja's temples. He installed images of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva in this temple. He also placed effigies of his father and himself riding horses in the temple premises. Just like Meru had five Kalpavrikshas, Someshvara built five temples in Ajayameru. He built so many temples at other places, that the population of city of gods declined. Someshvara appointed the Queen to protect his young son, and then departed to be with his father in the heaven. All his predecessors, from Chahamana to Prithvibhata came to welcome him, except Arnoraja's eldest son, who was hiding in the hell. = Canto 9 = During Karpura-devi's regency, the (Ajayameru) city was so densely populated and had so many man-made structures that the sun was not able to see more than a tenth of the land. Prithviraja's minister Kadamba-Vasa served him as Hanuman served Rama. He sent the armies in all the directions to add to the glory of the young king. All branches of learning united and came to Prithviraja, and he became knowledgeable about all the arts and sciences that a king should be proficient in. Kamadeva took service with him to learn archery, and to stop living in fear of Shiva. Prithviraja and his brother Hariraja were like Rama and Lakshmana. Prithviraja's maternal relative Bhuvanaika-Malla came to him to find out how he was able to protect the earth with only two arms. Bhuvanaika-Malla was an audacious warrior, and gave away all his wealth in charity. He wanted to raid the South, but decided against doing that because the respected sage Agastya lived there. An incarnation of Garuda, he served the two brothers loyally, and subdued the Nagas. With support of Kadamba-Vasa and Bhuvanaika-Malla, Prithviraja did many things for the welfare of his people. = Canto 10 = A statue of Prithviraja III When Prithviraja became an adult, many princesses expressed their desire to marry him. His good fortune also presented him with many opportunities to wage wars. When Vigraharaja's son Nagarjuna conquered Gudapura, Prithviraja led an army against him and besieged the Gudapura fort. Nagarjuna relinquished the duty of a warrior, and fled from the fort. Prithviraja killed his warriors and captured the fort. He brought Nagarjuna's wife and mother to Ajmer, and placed the heads of his enemies on the Ajmer fort's battlements. A beef-eating mlechchha named Ghori had captured Garjani in the North-West, where horses abound. His envoy was a bald man with the complexion of a leper, and spoke like wild birds. When he heard that Prithviraja had vowed to destroy the mlechchhas, he sent an ambassador to the Chahamana capital. Rajas (feudatory kings) took shelter in their fortresses in his fear. When he captured Naddula, Prithviraja became angry and vowed to subdue him. = Canto 11 = Sunda and Upasunda fight over Tilottama Prithviraja's minister Kadamba-Vasa advised him not to get angry and not to fight with Ghori. He said that the enemies will destroy themselves, just like Sunda and Upasunda ruined themselves over Tilottama. Just then, a messenger from Gujarat arrived and informed Prithviraja that the king of Gujarat had defeated Ghori's forces. Prithvibhatta, the chief of the poets, praised Kadambavasa as Ghori had been defeated without any effort from the Chahamana side. He then narrated the story of Tilottama. Prithviraja dismissed the messenger after bestowing gifts upon him. Prithviraja then visited his gallery, where Prithvbhatta showed him illustrations from the Ramayana, and narrated the king's deeds in his previous birth as Rama. The king then saw a portrait of Tilottama, and Kamadeva (the god of love) overpowered him. Prithviraja began to long for Tilottama, and left the gallery at noon, wounded by the arrows of Kamadeva. = Canto 12 = As Prithviraja came out of the gallery, he heard someone reciting a verse. The verse declared that a person who strives to get something gets it. Prithviraja asked Padmanabha (a minister of the former king Vigraharaja) who the reciter is. Padmanabha introduced the reciter as Jayanaka, a great poet-scholar from Kashmir, the seat of learning. Jayanaka explained that he came from Kashmir to Ajayameru, because the goddess of learning had asked him to serve the incarnation of Vishnu: Prithviraja. The only extant manuscript of the text ends abruptly in the twelfth chapter. It is thus incomplete, but it mentions the victory of Prithviraja over Ghori in the first Battle of Tarain.  Historical reliability  Having been written at the court of Prithviraja, the text is one of the most important sources of information about the Chahamana dynasty. According to Har Bilas Sarda, the historical accuracy of the poem's narrative is supported by historical inscriptions, as well as Jonaraja's commentary on it. For example, the genealogy of the Chahamana dynasty given in the text is nearly same as the one provided by the 1170 CE Bijolia inscription. There are only minor differences; for example, the Bijolia inscription has: * Guvaka instead of Govindaraja I (Guvaka being a diminutive of Govinda) * Shashi-nripa instead of Chandraraja (the two words are synonyms) * Vappyaraja instead of Vakpatiraja (variants) * Gandu instead of Govindaraja III (a diminutive) Sarda called Prithviraja Vijaya the most reliable literary work on the early history of the dynasty. Historian E. Sreedharan, on the other hand, described the text \\"an outrageous distortion of history\\" for its \\"Ramayanaization\\". He criticized the text for its characterization of Prithviraja as the divine incarnation of Rama. According to historian R. B. Singh of Gorakhpur University, the text \\"suffers from literary embellishments\\", but \\"its contents find full confirmation from the epigraphic evidence\\".

She recorded her Recollections of Early Times in San Diego in 1898. Early life Walker was born in 1828 in Methuen, Massachusetts. At age 15 she worked as a teacher in Groton, New Hampshire, where she taught at a district school, boarding with families in the community. Her initial salary was $4. It increased substantially, to $400, after Walker graduated from The State Normal School (now Framingham State University) in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1861. Her pay was soon cut in half due to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Career  Mason Street School, San Diego In April 1865, Walker left New York by steamer to travel to seek work in San Francisco. She suffered from sea sickness during the trip. When she disembarked in San Francisco, Walker was told that the only position available to her was in San Diego. = Teacher = After arriving in San Diego on July 5, 1865, Walker became the first teacher of the newly constructed Mason Street School. Walker was paid $65 a month. The Mason Street schoolhouse was the first public school to be built in San Diego County, and taught 35 students of ages 4 to 17 in a single classroom. Walker recalled: \\"My school was composed mostly of Spanish and half-breed children with a few English and several Americans. Many American soldiers and some sailors had come to San Diego in the early days and married pretty senoritas\\". = Controversy: Walker Incident = After an 11-month term at Mason Street, she was involved in a controversy which became known as the \\"Walker Incident\\". Walker met a stewardess who had helped her when she was seasick during her trip to San Francisco, and invited her to lunch at the Franklin House hotel. The stewardess is variously described as black, of mixed racial origin, or quadroon. This led to patrons walking out in disgust. Many of her students' parents considered her actions improper, and boycotted her classroom. The trustees of the San Diego School Board were divided in their opinion of her conduct. At the height of the controversy, Walker became engaged to senior trustee Ephraim Weed Morse and resigned her position after the 1866 spring semester. = Post Teaching in School = After retirement from teaching in public school, Walker did much work towards the suffragette movement and helping impoverished people. Walker became a private teacher for Rufina Porter, the daughter of Rufus Porter, a Spring Valley pioneer. Walker wrote articles for newspaper. In 1898, the year before her death, she published a paper entitled Recollections of Early Times in San Diego.

She has been awarded many grants and prizes, including a VicArts Grant (2016), an Australia Council Grant (2017), and Australian-Korean Foundation Grant (2016) [with Jessica L. Wilkinson and Dan Disney] and the Felix Meyer Fellowship. She received the University of California, Davis Mary Schroeder Award for her interview with Howard Zinn, the non-fiction Sanlane prize (United States) for In So Many Words and a Blanc Literary Prize (United Kingdom) for The Man Jar. She is currently an Associate Professor in Writing and Literature at Deakin University where she received the Vice-Chancellor‚Äôs Award for University Teacher of the Year. She is currently Head of Honours and Masters of Arts in Writing and Literature there. In 2017, Cassandra and Paul Hetherington signed an advance contract with Princeton University Press to write a book on prose poetry. =Themes= Atherton‚Äôs prose poetry explores the reanimation of canonical texts against a backdrop of popular culture references. She appeals to humour noir and the politicisation of the poet‚Äôs private spaces. Geoff Page writes: \\"Though many of the poems are anecdotal they also advance by sound associations and other aleatory devices. They tend to be seriously playful with a bent towards the satirical, even the self-mocking.\\" =Critical response= Atherton is praised for her prose poetry, and is likened to masters of the form. Michael Farrell writes: \\"Cassandra Atherton‚Äôs nervy style is distinct from an earlier generation of prose poets (Joanne Burns, Gary Catalano, Ania Walwicz); it feels both post-punk and post-John Forbes.\\" While others, such as Chloe Wilson, have praised her for exploring the fundamental question of any poet: \\"They are works in which the speaker, moving back and forth between text and experience, continually asks an unanswerable question: ‚ÄòHow do I write the space between my heart and my pen?'\\" While Atherton's prose poetry is informed by previous poets and investigates the anxiety of the artist, Ivy Ireland has observed dark humour in her collection of prose poetry, Exhumed: \\"Dazzling, vibrant and terribly witty, ... Exhumed does not give itself over entirely to the horribly serious, gruesome images invoked by its title.\\" Australian writer Kerryn Goldsworthy notes in a critique of Atherton's Trace (2015) that \\"The dense, intense prose is often funny, and incorporates all kinds of cultural allusions.\\" Collaboration Atherton most often collaborates with artist and writer Phil Day and scholar and poet, Paul Hetherington. She is currently engaged in collaborating on Sketch Notes 4 and 5 with Day and a series of artist's books with both Hetherington and Day. She was awarded a VicArts Grant (2016) to collaborate on writing a prose poetry graphic novel with Day and scholar/poet Alyson Miller, titled Pika-don.

Her sister arranged for her to marry her general Jo√£o Guterres Ngola Kanini, and appointed her as her designated heir and successor. Barbara was taken captive by the Portuguese, and kept hostage during the negotiations between them and her sister. In 1656, in connection to the release of Barbara from Portuguese custody in exchange for hundreds of slaves, Nzinga signed a peace treaty with the Portuguese and re-converted to Catholicism. After the death of Nzinga, Barbara succeeded her on the throne.

Ana II faced a Portuguese invasion in 1744. The invasion of Matamba by Portuguese forces in 1744 was one of their largest military operations in the eighteenth century. In the course of their attack, Matamba's army inflicted a serious defeat on the Portuguese, but in spite of this, a remnant of the army managed to reach the capital of Matamba. In order to avoid a long war and to get them to withdraw, Ana II signed a treaty of vassalage with Portugal which renewed points conceded by Ver√≥nica in 1683. While the treaty allowed Portugal to claim Matamba as a vassal, and opened up Matamba to Portuguese trade, it had little effect on the real sovereignty of Matmaba, or indeed in the conduct of trade. Ana II, like Ver√≥nica before her, was interested in developing Matamba as a Christian country, routinely sending letters to the Capuchin prefect of Congo and Angola or the Portuguese authorities requesting missionaries come and establish permanent bases in her country. While the country was visited by missionaries from Cahenda and also from the Barefoot Carmelites, a permanent mission was not established. She died in 1756 and was succeeded by her heir, Ver√≥nica II, who was two years later deposed and killed by her daughter, Ana III. ;Issue: * Ver√≥nica II Guterres (d. 1758), may have been niece and adoptive daughter * Ana III Guterres (d. 1767)  References  * Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates, Encyclopedia of Africa, Volym 1 * Fernando Campos: Conflitos na dinastia Guterres atrav√©s da sua cronologia1, √Åfrica: Revista do Centro de Estudos Africanos.

Clay won the fight through a technical knockout when the referee stopped the fight in the sixth round. Miteff and Clay would feature in the 1962 film Requiem for a Heavyweight. Background Miteff had won the gold medal for the heavyweight championship at the 1955 Pan American Games. He had fought twice with George Chuvalo in boxing matches, in June 1958 and March 1961, drawing the first bout and losing on a split decision in the second. Miteff had also defeated Clay's previous opponent Alonzo Johnson. At the time of the Clay-Miteff bout, Miteff had a record of twenty four wins and ten losses. Buildup At the time of the Clay-Miteff bout, Clay was 19 years old and weighed 188 pounds ; Miteff was 27 or 28 and weighed 210 pounds. However, at 6 feet three inches, Clay was two inches taller than Miteff.Miteff had competed against some of the top level boxers at the time. He was tough and had the reputation of being a strong puncher. It was held that the Clay-Miteff match would provide Clay's toughest test to date. Before the fight, Clay had informed reporters: However, Clay also made a prediction before this fight: \\"He'll go in six [rounds].\\" =Gloves= Just before the match, it was realized that boxing gloves had not been arranged for the bout.

The procured gloves were \\"hard as a rock\\"; it was believed that the usage of these gloves would favor Miteff since he was regarded a better puncher than Clay. The Fight =Round 1= In the first round, Clay sprung a surprise by trying for a swift knockout using multiple combinations. However, Miteff was able to withstand Clay's punches while also throwing infrequent hooks to Clay's body. =Round 2= Clay continued throwing punches at Miteff until he was hit on the jaw by a powerful right by Miteff. This slowed Clay down for the rest of this round which Miteff won. While providing anxious moments to Clay supporters, Clay's recovery from Miteff's punch dispelled doubts about Clay's ability to withstand punishment in the ring. =Rounds 3-5= Rounds three through five featured a similar pattern of Miteff throwing hooks to Clay's body, and Clay throwing combinations at Miteff's face. During these rounds, Miteff would occasionally make strange faces, or let his hands drop, and challenge Clay to punch him. =Round 6= It was still a close fight till the middle of round 6 when Clay hit Miteff with a tentative left jab followed by a right on the chin which knocked down Miteff. Miteff got up and moved towards a corner \\"in the determined important walk of a drunk\\" following which the referee stopped the fight. Aftermath After the match, Clay commented that the right which had knocked out Miteff was the hardest punch he had thrown in the ring to date. Angelo Dundee noted the technical improvements in Clay's boxing that were observed in this fight: Clay's next boxing match, also held in Louisville, would be with Willi Besmanoff. Miteff would only fight three more boxing matches in his fight career‚Äîin November 1961, August 1966, and April 1967; he would win the 1966 bout and lose the other two matches. For many years Miteff worked as the chauffeur of David Susskind; he also worked as a hotel greeter. =Requiem for a Heavyweight= Both Clay and Miteff featured in the 1962 film Requiem for a Heavyweight in which the protagonist Mountain Rivera, a boxer long past his prime, gets badly beaten in his final bout by a younger opponent. The character of Mountain Rivera was played by Anthony Quinn, and the part of the younger boxer by Clay. Miteff, whose own boxing career had disintegrated by this time, played Quinn's double in the film. It has been suggested that the boxing careers of Mountain Rivera and Miteff have conspicuous parallels. Clay's performance in the fight scene of the film was later described as \\"explosive\\".

It has rough, tessellated dark gray bark on some, rarely all of the trunk, smooth creamy white bark above that is shed in thin scales. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are heart-shaped to egg-shaped at first, later lance shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of green on both sides, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The tree is usually leafless by the middle of the dry season. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are smooth and glossy, pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded to flattened operculum. Flowering occurs from June to November and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a thin-walled, cup-shaped to cylindrical or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long.

Under the Wheelhouse banner also is Spoke Studios, the content arm of Wheelhouse Entertainment, which creates programming across a variety of platforms and genres. Wheelhouse Entertainment and Spoke Studios operate on both the East and West Coasts. In November 2018, Wheelhouse forged a partnership with comedian, writer and producer Jimmy Kimmel ‚Äì host of Jimmy Kimmel Live! ‚Äì forming the new entertainment and content company Kimmelot, which operates as part of Wheelhouse Entertainment. Through the deal, Kimmel also became a partner in Wheelhouse Entertainment. The first project announced from Kimmelot is the revival of the puppet comedy, Crank Yankers for Comedy Central. In January 2019, Wheelhouse Entertainment secured an investment and partnership deal with digital content studio Portal A, through which they will offer their combined resources to traditional and new media platforms, and to brands, CMOs and ad agencies. Montgomery, who previously was CEO of ITV America, also currently serves as strategic advisor to ITV America, which maintains a production partnership with Spoke Studios; the companies work together on a range of series and projects produced by ITV America's in-house production team. Montgomery was named CEO of ITV America in 2015 following the 2014 acquisition of his company, Leftfield Entertainment, for $360 million by UK-based, multi-national media company ITV. ITV America encompasses production companies including ITV Entertainment, Leftfield Pictures, Sirens Media, Outpost Entertainment, High Noon Entertainment and Thinkfactory Media. Under Montgomery's leadership, in 2017 ITV America's revenue increased by 33%. Career Brent Montgomery began his television career working for Texas CBS affiliate KBTX, which subsequently paid for the majority of his tuition at Texas A&M.; He later moved to New York and landed positions on such series as The Bachelor, Wife Swap and Blind Date. Montgomery started his first production company, Leftfield Pictures, in 2002 with $10,000. Leftfield Pictures initially shot wedding videos while developing its entertainment content and clientele, and eventually sold its first series, The Principal‚Äôs Office, in 2008. Montgomery developed the concept for Leftfield Pictures‚Äô flagship series Pawn Stars while in Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Struck by the number of pawn shops in the city, Montgomery set out to locate a shop with the right setting and staff around which to build a television series. Ultimately, Montgomery negotiated a deal with Gold & Silver Pawn Shop co-owner Rick Harrison, and pitched the show to the History Channel. In 2009, Pawn Stars premiered on History as a top rated series for the network, highlighting the ‚Äúhidden treasures‚Äù genre of programming. Leveraging the success of the series, which was one of the highest-rated shows on cable television, Montgomery grew Leftfield Pictures rapidly with myriad series and hundreds of programming hours soon added to Leftfield's roster. In addition to Pawn Stars, other Leftfield Pictures series and Montgomery credits include the award-winning Alone, American Restoration and Counting Cars for History; American Grit featuring host John Cena for Fox; Bethenny & Fredrik for Bravo, and National Geographic Channel‚Äôs specials Billy the Kid: The New Evidence (executive produced by Kevin Costner) and Brain Surgery Live. In 2013 Montgomery established parent company Leftfield Entertainment (LFE), and assumed the role of CEO, in conjunction with acquiring production company Sirens Media (Real Housewives of New Jersey). He then launched additional production companies under the LFE umbrella ‚Äì Loud TV and Outpost Entertainment ‚Äì before selling 80% of the company for $360 million to ITV in 2014. At the end of 2015, Montgomery completed a deal through which ITV acquired all of the Leftfield Entertainment group.

The Vikings trailed 23‚Äì9 in the fourth quarter, but won after Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer passed for two touchdowns to wide receiver Ahmad Rashad in the last two minutes, including a 46-yard Hail Mary pass caught with one hand on the last play of the game. The final play is also known as the \\"Miracle Catch.\\" The Vikings won, 28‚Äì23.  Game summary  The Vikings came into the game with an 8‚Äì6 record. The Browns, nicknamed the Kardiac Kids for their many close games, were 10‚Äì4. A win for the Browns would clinch them a playoff berth, while a win for the Vikings would clinch them the NFC Central and a playoff appearance. The Browns were favored by 3 points. = First half = The Browns opened up the scoring in the first quarter when their quarterback, eventual league MVP Brian Sipe, threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Hill, giving Cleveland a 7‚Äì0 lead. In the second quarter, the Browns added to their lead when Sipe ran for a two-yard touchdown, but kicker Don Cockroft failed to convert the extra point, so the score was 13‚Äì0 going into halftime. = Early second half = In the second half, the Vikings offense came alive, led by Tommy Kramer. Kramer threw a 31-yard touchdown to Joe Senser at the beginning of the quarter. Vikings kicker Rick Danmeier then missed an extra point of his own, making the score 13‚Äì6 in favor of the Browns. Cockroft and Danmeier both made short field goals for their teams later in the third quarter, and the score grew to 16‚Äì9. Early in the fourth quarter, Cleo Miller ran for a two-yard Browns touchdown, making the score 23‚Äì9 with the extra point and seemingly putting the game away. = Vikings comeback = Kramer led a drive for the Vikings in response that resulted in a second touchdown pass, this time to running back Ted Brown, with 5:01 remaining in the game. Danmeier then missed another extra point, meaning the Vikings still trailed by two scores, 23‚Äì15. The Browns received the ensuing kickoff and began trying to run out the clock with repeated handoffs to running back Mike Pruitt. Then, on second and 8 with 2:18 left, Browns coach Sam Rutigliano called a surprise pass play, but Sipe's throw was intercepted by Bobby Bryant, giving the Vikings a chance to come back. After the interception, Kramer led the Vikings down the field, completing 4 of 5 passes for 47 yards and a touchdown to Ahmad RashƒÅd. The drive took only 37 seconds. The Vikings still trailed by 1 point after Danmeier kicked the extra point, and had to kick off with 1:35 left. After the Vikings failed to recover an onside kick, the Browns regained the ball at the Minnesota 44-yard line. They again tried to run out the clock, but on second down, Browns tackle Cody Risien was called for illegal motion, negating a five-yard run by Mike Pruitt and backing the Browns up five yards. This would be the difference in the success of the drive, as Pruitt was tackled by Scott Studwell a yard short of the line to gain on third down. The Browns punted with 23 seconds left, giving the Vikings one last chance. = The Miracle = After a touchback on the punt, the Vikings got the ball with 14 seconds left and no timeouts on their own 20-yard line. Vikings coach Bud Grant called a hook and lateral on the drive's first play. Kramer passed to Senser, who immediately lateraled to Ted Brown. Brown ran out of bounds after a 39-yard gain with only five seconds remaining in the game. TheVikingAge called this play the \\"greatest trick play in Vikings history.\\" Things still looked bleak for the Vikings; NBC broadcaster Len Dawson predicted, \\"they're gonna throw that ball up in the air and hope for a miracle.\\" On the game's final snap, Bud Grant called the play \\"Squadron Right\\", in which three wide receivers line up on the right side of the Vikings formation and all run go routes to the end zone. Kramer dropped back and threw a Hail Mary pass to the right side into a crowd of players. The pass was tipped by Browns defensive back Thom Darden at the 5-yard line and then caught one-handed by Rashad at the 1-yard line. Rashad went into the end zone for a game-winning touchdown with no time left. Danmeier's extra point was blocked, so the final score was 28‚Äì23.  Aftermath  Kramer finished with one of the best games of his career, compiling 456 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions. To date, he is the only Vikings quarterback to pass for over 450 yards in a single game. (He topped this total in 1986, passing for 490 yards against the Washington Redskins.) By winning this game, the Vikings clinched the NFC Central division title and a spot in the playoffs. As the #3 seed, they traveled to Philadelphia to face the Eagles. Despite holding a 14‚Äì7 lead at halftime, the Vikings lost 31‚Äì16, and the Eagles went on to win the NFC Championship and appear in Super Bowl XV. The Browns overcame their loss and defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the season's final game to win the AFC Central division, but then lost in devastating fashion to the eventual Super Bowl champion Oakland Raiders in the \\"Red Right 88\\" game.

The team was created after the huge success the company's other team, the Phillips 66ers, had achieved in the 1940s and early 1950s. History =The first Oilers= In 1920, in Bartlesville, Oklahoma the Phillips 66ers (nicknamed as the Oilers) was founded by the company's employees. Boots Adams, future president of the company, helped organize the 66ers and played on the team as well. Featuring players like Bob Kurland, the game‚Äôs first 7-foot center, Phillips became a dominant force in its league winning 11 national titles (with 10 second-place finishes) and 11 first-place finishes in the NIBL (including 10 straight between 1948 and 1958). Thirty years later, Boots' son, Bud, owner of the Ada company (he later purchased the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League), introduced the idea of similarly forming a basketball team from the company, based in Houston. Thanks to his support, the team was founded in 1952 with Ada Oil company sponsorship. They instantly became as part of the National Industrial Basketball League, an amateur league that seriously challenged the NBA for players and headlines during its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s. The Oilers never really challenged their sisterly club, the Phillips 66ers for league supremacy, going 24‚Äì34 in NIBL games in their three years here (1952 through 1955). =A talented generation= Featuring players such as Johnny Stanich, a UCLA All-American who was a star despite a childhood accident that cost him three fingers on his left hand, Parks, a defense-minded swingman who played with Kurland at Oklahoma A&M;, Nick Revon, a lightning-quick guard from New Orleans, Marc Freiberger, a 6-11 center from Oklahoma, and Elton Cotton, a 6-6 forward from the University of Houston who could throw down \\"skywalking dunks\\", the Oilers could be a competitive force. =AAU success= The Ada Oilers had their best showing in the 1956 AAU tournament after Bud Adams sold the squad to Vickers Petroleum in Wichita. The Oilers finished third that year, losing a tense game to the 66ers in the semifinals (71‚Äì69). The Oilers, who traveled in Adams-designed outfits that featured cowboy boots and hats, along with full-length fur overcoats, provided a colorful footnote to the city‚Äôs sports history. Johnny Stanich, who rejected an offer from the New York Knicks to play in the NIBL, began his career with the Phillips 66ers and spent two years playing in Denver before ending his career with Ada, retiring as an executive in the company. Players were expected to put in a full day in the office or out in the field before practicing or playing in their \\"off\\" hours. though the team would travel first-class by Bud Adams‚Äô private plane.

Biography Kon was born in Had≈æiƒái (near Sarajevo), where her father, Joseph Bergmann, worked as a railway officer. The middle-class Bergmann family, Ashkenazi Jews, moved from Vienna during the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kon's mother was determined not to allow financial or social issues to limit the opportunities of her four daughters. In order to enable them to attend university, the Bergmanns enrolled their daughters into gymnasium; Marija and her older sister Berta thus became first female pupils in Mostar's Velika gimnazija in 1905, and seven years later Berta became the first girl in Bosnia and Herzegovina to finish high school. Both sisters went on to study in Vienna, with Kon choosing Slavic and German studies. In 1916 Kon gained a doctorate degree from the University of Vienna and returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina as its first female Doctor of Philosophy. During the interwar period Kon taught at gymnasiums in Mostar, Cetinje and Sarajevo. She married a civil engineer and had two children. With the rise of Nazi Party in Germany in the 1930s, however, anti-semitism started gaining foothold in Yugoslavia. Kon had to personally combat proto-Usta≈°a inclinations of some of her students. The situation rapidly worsened after the invasion of Yugoslavia by Axis powers in April 1941, when Sarajevo and the rest of Bosnia became part of the Independent State of Croatia, a fascist puppet state. Kon lost her job and soon found herself interned with her family in Rab concentration camp. Following the camp's liberation in 1943, she reached Partisan territory in Croatia proper, becoming a gymnasium principal in Glina. Her children became Partisan fighters; her son was killed in action, and her daughter captured and sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Kon's sister Berta also actively supported the Partisans until her internment and death in 1945. Kon and her daughter belonged to a fifth of Sarajevo's Jews who survived the Holocaust. She continued her career in the high schools of Mostar and Sarajevo until 1950, when she was invited to participate in the creation of a German language and literature department at the University of Sarajevo. As university professor she was most involved with early modern and modern German literature until her retirement in 1967. Kon died in Sarajevo in 1987.

While leaving, he stepped on the rock. The rock contains a somewhat foot-shaped indent on top which the Algonquin pointed to in order to support this tale. The European settlers assigned this legend to the Biblical Samson after being told the legend in the 1600s, giving the rock its name. Samson Rock has been preserved for its legendary significance, but is relatively hard to find, tucked between two shopping centers and a parking lot.

History  Nazrul Islam, a panel mayor of Narayanganj City Corporation who was in good terms with Mayor Dr. Selina Hayat Ivy, with three associates and his driver went missing from Fatullah area of Narayanganj on 27 April 2014. His lawyer Chandan Kumar Sarker who was following the car of Nazrul Islam, also went missing on the same day with his driver from the same place. Within one week of the event, the dead bodies of the victims were seen floating on the Shitalakshya River on which the Narayanganj District stands on. Two cases were filed in connection with the murders. Nazrul's wife Selina Islam Beauty filed a case against six people, including vice-president of Siddhirganj Awami League and Councillor Nur Hossain, while Chandan's son-in- law Bijoy Kumar Paul filed the other case against Nazmul Haque partner of an engineering firm and some unknown people. Nazrul's father-in-law Shahidul Islam alleged that Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) personnel abducted and killed Nazrul in exchange for Tk 60 million from local ward councillor Nur Hossain.  Investigation  Several probe committees were formed by the government, Police and RAB. CID was given the charge to investigate the case as per the directive of the High Court while the government assigned Detective Branch of Police with the task. On 12 November 2014, the Supreme Court after hearing a petition of attorney general exempted CID from the investigation. More than a year later, on 4 June 2015, the High Court directed RAB, the government's seven-member probe committee, the inspector general of police and the CID to submit progress reports on their investigations.

Early life  Tapp was born in Sydney on 2 June 1929 and grew up in Vaucluse. His father was Earnest Charles Tapp, a radio technician in the Australian Navy and his mother was Sarah Ann (Sadie), a managing director of Rosenthal Australia ‚Äì a German-owned department store in George Street, Sydney. He was an only child. Tapp lived in a house with a tennis court and a maid during the 1930s and later became a full-time boarder at the Scots College in Bellevue Hill. A champion sportsman and scholar, he represented his school in many sports, swimming, cricket, football, rowing, diving and played tennis at a state level. It is said that he played with, and against, Australian tennis champions Lew Hoad and Frank Sedgman. He was known to be agonisingly shy and had a pronounced stutter. While at Scots College, Tapp read the Ion Idriess book 'Cattle King' about the Sir Sidney Kidman who owned large cattle stations in the Northern Territory. The book had a lasting effect on him and he decided that as soon as he finished school he would become a cattleman. His mother Sadie secured a job as a jackeroo-bookkeeper on Elsey Station near the tiny township of Mataranka 400 kilometres south of Darwin, made famous by the book We of the Never Never. Tapp settled into station life learning everything he could. He left Elsey Station a few years later to manage Rosewood Station on the Northern Territory-Western Australian border. Two years later he established a droving business in the early 1950s, moving cattle from Alice Springs through Tennant Creek and Elliott along the Murranji Track. In 1952 Bill Tapp and business partner Bill Crowson bought Montejinni Station. With Crowson's family, the business partners transported all their worldly possessions and their plant of horses up the Murranji to Montejinni. With them was Aboriginal stockman and a young sixteen year old deaf man, Kenny Wesley. Simultaneously, Paul and Mick Vandeleur acquired Camfield Station and Leo Izod and Ivor Townshend Hall drew Killarney Station. These names formed the initials for the brands of CTT for Montejinni and ITH for Killarney. Following a break down in the relationship with the Crowson's, Bill Tapp began talks with Izod and Hall about buying Killarney Station and reached an agreement in 1960 to pay ¬£90,000, a Northern Territory record price for a cattle station at that time. He received title to Killarney in 1962.  The Cattle King  Tapp's empire began under a bough shed at Mayvale Bore with a sign swinging off a post saying \\"COCKRAG DOWNS.' His first stock camp consisted of brothers Jim Forscutt and Boko Forscutt, Joey and Alfie Russell, and Kenny Wesley. He worked tirelessly, mustering and building fences to contain the wild cattle. They lived on salted beef and black tea. Tapp met his future wife June Clements (n√©e Forscutt), a divorcee with three small children Toni, Billy and Shing, while staying at her mother's house in Katherine. After their first meeting, Tapp stated that he wanted to marry her. The courtship was short and sweet and June soon found herself out at Killarney Station living under a bough shed, a structure made from four tree posts with fencing wire slung across the top and branches thrown over to make shade. The bough shed was the kitchen, the office and doctors surgery. On 2 August 1962, Tapp wrote in his diary, 'Day off ‚Äì got married today'. Bill and June Tapp went on to have seven more children, Sam, Joe, Ben, William,Caroline, Daniel and Kate. Tapp went on to purchase Maryfield Station, Roper Valley Station and Mountain Valley Station. Later life Bill Tapp and June divorced in 1985. After years of mismanagement of credit extensions by agricultural company Elders, the Tapp family properties went into receivership in 1991. All three properties owned by the Tapps were advertised for sale. After a supreme court battle between the Tapps and Elders, Killarney Station and Maryfield Station were sold, but the Tapps were permitted to retain Roper Valley Station. Tapp died on 23 May 1992https://supremecourt.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/781196/1992-NTSC-123-Elders- Rural-Finance-Ltd-v-Tapp-6-Aug-1992-Martin-J.pdf in his own bed on Killarney Station at the age of 62. He was buried at the station on 3 June. A plaque on his grave reads: > Killarney stands as a monument to his vision and contribution to the > Northern Territory horse and cattle industry.

After the primary, Geary began traveling around the state speaking with Republican candidates running for House seats. Shortly after the primary election, Dave Baun announced he already had 24 of the 31 votes needed to be elected speaker. Nevertheless, Geary continued to meet with Republican candidates.\\"State Senate Prexy Post is Likely to Go to Elmo Smith\\", Corvallis Gazette-Times, Corvallis, Oregon, May 29, 1954, p. 1.\\"Geary Continues his Speaking Tour\\", Medford Mail Tribune, Medford, Oregon, June 7, 1954, p. 9. By September, Baun had over 40 pledged votes, assuring his election as speaker. However, Baun lost his seat in the general election to a Democratic challenger, leaving Geary as the only Republican candidate for speaker.Olson, James D., \\"Ed Geary Now Sure of House Speakership\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, November 6, 1954, p. 1 & 7. The legislative session began on January 10. While the Republicans had a 35 to 25 majority in House, Geary was elected to the speaker position unanimously by his House peers.\\"Legislature Names New Term Chiefs\\", Herald and News, Klamath Falls, Oregon, January 10, 1955, p. 1. At the beginning of the session, the House decided to allow radio and television reporters inside the chambers for first time. However, live broadcasting was not authorized except with prior approval of the speaker. As speaker, Geary framed a number of important issues for House action. These issues included expanding unemployment insurance to cover all Oregon workers, raising the minimum wage for teachers across the state, and increasing the pay of Oregon Supreme Court judges. The legislature also passed a bill urging the United States Congress to admit Alaska as a state. The session ended on 4 May. It was the second longest legislative session in Oregon history, lasting a total of 115 days.\\"State Capital Readies for Legislative Start\\", Oregon Statesman, Salem, Oregon, January 5, 1955, p. 1.\\"Oregon Legislators Get Down to Work\\", Eugene Register Guard, Eugene, Oregon, January 10, 1955, p. 1. While Geary was not a dynamic public politician, he proved to be an excellent behind-the-scene leader throughout the session. As a result, some newspapers began suggesting that he had potential for higher state office.Wade, Murry, \\"Capital Parade\\", Heppner Gazette Times, Heppner, Oregon, March 31, 1955, p. 2.\\"Long Legislative Session Ends at Salem\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, May 5, 1955, p. 1. As speaker of the Oregon House, Geary had the opportunity to serve as acting governor on several occasions. At that time, the Oregon State Senate president served as acting governor whenever the elected governor was out of the state. As speaker of the house, Geary was next in line, serving as acting governor when both Governor Paul L. Patterson and senate president Elmo E. Smith were out of the state at the same time. The first time he served as acting governor was in September 1955.\\"Geary Sits for Governor\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, September 13, 1955, p. 3.

He served as governor once again in January 1957. This occurred only a few days before Geary's term as speaker ended.\\"Geary Becomes Acting Governor\\", Oregon Statesman, Salem, Oregon, January 1, 1957, p. 5.  Later life  In 1956, Geary announced he would run for the Oregon State Senate in District 18. That senate district represented Klamath County, the same constituency that Geary represented in the Oregon House of Representatives. Harry D.

The British East India Company's government in India purchased her in 1801 for service as an armed brig in the Bay of Bengal and along the Coromandel Coast. In 1804 she sailed to Britain where the Admiralty purchased her for use as a fire ship, and named her HMS Firebrand. She was wrecked in 1804. History =Ad√®le= In May 1800, Nicholas Surcouf commissioned Ad√®le. She was described as a \\"beautiful little vessel (‚Ä¶.) recently fitted out at Nantz, well found, and in every respect qualified for the service she was intended to perform\\".Asiatic Annual Register... (1802), Vol.3, pp.47-8. Ad√®le sailed from Mauritius on the evening of 25 August, in company with the privateer Gloire. Ad√®le and Surcouf captured eight small prizes, four of which he permitted to go on their way after Surcouf had plundered them of what he had thought necessary. However, on 13 November 1800 he encountered a British brig-sloop man-of-war. =Capture= , Captain William Waller, captured Ad√®le (or Adel) at . Ad√®le was armed with 10 guns and had a crew of 60 men. Albatross had left Bombay and near the Point de Galle encountered a Danish vessel that informed him that the French privateers and were in the Bay of Bengal preying on British commerce. Waller therefore sailed north to attempt to find them. At about 00:45 hours on 13 November 1800, Albatross was well into the Bay of Bengal when she encountered a strange vessel. The size and behavior of the strange vessel suggested that she might be Malartic; however, she might also be . As the strange vessel approached Albatross cleared for action. The stranger fired two shots and when asked if she was Mongoose, replied, \\"French privateer Ad√®le. Heave to and send your boat on board.\\" Albatross immediately fired a broadside that Ad√®le returned. The two vessels exchanged fire at close range for about half an hour until Ad√®le attempted to board. Albatross repelled the attempt and Ad√®le, now aware that she was not dealing with a merchant vessel, started to flee. Albatross gave chase and within another half an hour, caught up. The two vessels exchanged broadsides with the muzzles of their cannon touching when Ad√®le struck, and a British boarding party took possession of her.Capture of L'Adele French Privateer. Naval Chronicle (Vol. 6: July to December 1801), p.339. Ad√®le had lost six men killed and 13 wounded. Albatross had lost one marine and one seaman (from ) killed, and six men wounded (one of whom belonged to Braave and one to ). Surcouf surrendered to Waller and offered him his sword, which Waller, as a sign of respect, declined to take. Albatross had captured Ad√®le some 90 leagues south of the Sandheads (at the mouth of the Ganges River). Ad√®le arrived at Kedgeree on 25 November. Waller and Albatross went on to capture on 23 March 1801. The Madras Insurance Company presented Waller with an honour sword and a piece of plate (each worth ¬£200) as a reward for the service he had rendered by this capture and that of Ad√®le. =Waller= General Sir Arthur Wellesley acquired Ad√®le on behalf of the EIC, named her Waller, and sent her to Trincomalee with dispatches. Lieutenant Alexander Davidson, of the Royal Navy, became Wallers commander. He was already her commander in December 1800. Then on 21 January 1801 he wrote a letter to Wellesley asking for permission to purchase four guns from the transport Eliza to complete her armament. Wellesley arranged for their purchase. Later that year Waller supported General David Baird's expedition to co-operate with Ralph Abercromby in the expulsion of the French from Egypt. She accompanied Baird to Kosseir. Baird landed there and led his army across the desert to Kena on the Nile, and then to Cairo. In 1803 Davidson sailed Waller from Malacca to Amboyna and back, and then on to Madras. As he did so he took many sightings to facilitate navigation.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, pp.304-7. Lastly, the EIC employed Waller to take a cargo to Britain. Still under Davidson's command, she left Calcutta on 9 January 1804 and arrived at London in April.British Library: Waller. =HMS Firebrand= The Admiralty purchased Waller in August and converted her into a fire ship under the name HMS Firebrand. She was at Woolwich between 20 August and 11 September undergoing fitting out. Lieutenant William MacLean commissioned her in August. She was to undergo further fitting out between 17 October and 15 December, but fate intervened. Loss Firebrand was in the Downs on 13 October when she weighed and sailed for Dover. Visibility was bad during the night and as she did not have a pilot aboard it is possible that she mistook some lights ashore for boats at anchor and the Dover pier. Shortly before midnight she grounded and started to take on water. A local pilot came out and tried to get her off, but her back was broken and water was coming in too fast for the pumps. Her crew took to their boats and no lives were lost. Lieutenant MacLean spent some time in the cold water before he was rescued; he died three weeks after his rescue, perhaps as a consequence.

The ribbon farm concept originated with Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac's founding of the fort, first called Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit, in July 1701. (See also the original map that covers a wider area, including Belle Isle Park) Thomas Williams (died November 30, 1785), originally from Albany, New York, settled in Detroit, Michigan in 1765. He married Cecile Chapeau from a prominent French-Canadian family that had settled in Michigan in 1710. Williams was a merchant, landowner, and was active in civic and political affairs. Goods were transported to Detroit from Albany via canoe, which could take a number of months for a round-trip. He petitioned for equitable opportunities to engage in trade at Fort Niagara and Detroit. In his role as justice of the peace, he was charged to uphold the law and punish those who were deemed to have broken the law. As notary, he executed legal documents for the settlement. He was also town crier and took the 1782 census. He married Cecile Campeau from a prominent family of French heritage who had come to Michigan about 1710. Cecile's brother, Joseph, was the state's first millionaire. Their son, John R. Williams, was the first mayor of Detroit. Early life Williams was born in Albany, New York, where his ancestors settled in 1690. He served in the New York militia as an officer. Williams settled in Detroit in 1765. Career Fort Detroit in 1763The Siege of the Fort at Detroit, depiction of the 1763 Siege of Fort Detroit by Frederic Remington. Williams was a trader and licensed merchant, who brought goods to Detroit from Albany via canoe. The round-trip could many months. In 1768, he made the round-trip with George Meldrum from Schenectady. His partner was John Casety. Williams signed a number of petitions against British regulation to sell goods at posts. The political climate was difficult between the British, who had taken rule of Detroit in 1760 and the French, with whom they were still at war in 1762. The French and the Indians attacked the British in May 1763 in what was called the Siege of Fort Detroit. Traders coming to Fort Detroit were killed or captured. Civil unrest continued, particularly regarding the restriction of trading to the posts by the British and a monopoly that William Rutherford held at Fort Niagara. Williams signed a number of petitions against the regulations in 1766 and 1767. In 1766, he was one of the merchants allowed to trade at Fort Niagara. Indians, on their way to Fort Niagara, were often met by people on the lake who sold them their wares, which drove down business at the fort. The British rules also favored the French who were given the fur trade, allowed to winter with the Indians and trade in the process, and got around rules for trading rum by selling on credit. Many of the traders in the region that signed the petitions were from Albany, many of the Albany Dutch. He was also active in civic and political affairs. Captn. Richard B. Lernhout, the military commandant, appointed Thomas justice of the peace and notary and/or judge in Detroit under British rule. As justice of the peace, his duties were to upload local statutes and ordinances, issue warrants, punish and/or imprison those who break the statutes and ordinance, and ensure the quiet rule of Detroit. He was to execute legal documents in his role as notary. Williams voted in the Detroit's first election that was held in 1768 to elect a judge and justice. He was one of Detroit's town criers who passed on the news of the day by speaking to a crowd of people or by ringing a bell while walking through the streets and calling out the news. View of Detroit in 1796. Landmarks from left to right: Citadel, Wayne Street, St. Anne's Church, Brig. Gen. Gage, and Griswold Street Williams performed the census for Detroit in 1782 and calculated that there were 2,191 people compared to 1,367 in 1773. The totals do not include Indians or the garrison. Clarence M. Burton attributes the growth to people moving to the area to avoid the war. With the number of people in the garrison and those detained as prisoners of war and refugees, Burton estimates that there likely more than 3,000 people in Detroit in 1782. Personal life Williams was married to Marie Cecile (commonly called Cecile or Cecelia) Chapeau by A.S. DePeyster, commandant of Fort Detroit on May 7, 1781. It was one of Detroit's early Protestant marriages. They were married by the commandant because they did not wish to be married by a Catholic priest. Their marriage certificate stated that the couple's relationship would be \\"conformable by the rule of the Church of England.\\" Cecile was from a prominent family. Her father was Jacques Chapeau and her brothers were Barnabas, Denis, Joseph, Louis, Nicolas and Toussaint Chapeau. Joseph was the state's first millionaire. His mother's family had a French heritage and had been in Michigan since 1710. They had three children: Catherine, Elizabeth, and John R. Elizabeth taught in a Catholic school that co-founded with three other young women under the auspices of Gabriel Richard, a Detroit priest. She lived a single, chaste lifestyle. In 1809, Catherine married Jean Baptiste Peltier with whom she had two children. John R. was the first mayor of Detroit, and served several of times more. He and his wife, Mary Mott Williams, had nine children. Since Cecile was French Canadian, John R. spoke and wrote fluently in both French and English. Williams lived on Woodbridge Street in the 9th Ward in Detroit and owned a lot of land in the area. During the Revolutionary War, William's property in Albany was confiscated. He or his family later had the property returned to them. He died of the measles on November 30, 1785. On December 12 of the same year, Cecile leased a house from Joseph Campeau that was north of the Detroit River and adjacent to Joseph Campeau's property. At the time of his death, much of his property was lost; there was just some property in Albany and a 600-acre farm on the Huron River of Lake St. Clair. Although these were significant holdings for the time, there was a large loss of his property, perhaps due to his wife's lavish lifestyle or the carelessness of Casety, his partner. Cecile and her children lived on the St. Clair property after Williams' death. In July 1790, Cecile married Jaques Leson (also spelled Loson and Lauson) and they lived in what is now St. Clair County, Michigan. They had a daughter, Angelique. Cecile died on June 24, 1805 and was buried in the St. Anne's church cemetery.

History The institute was founded as the Interterritorial Language Committee in 1930 under British colonial rule in East Africa tasked with creating a standardized form of the language from 17 dialects. The Kiunguja dialect spoken in Zanzibar was chosen as the base. The committee was also involved in the standardizing spelling as well as coining new words. The committee was reorganized into a purely academic institution as Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili (TUKI) (Institute of Kiswahili Research) in 1964 and integrated into the University of Dar es Salaam in 1970. The standardization functions of the committee were transferred to the Baraza la Kiswahili la Taifa.Massamba pp 63-64 The institute received its current name in 2009 when it merged with the University of Dar es Salaam's Department of Kiswahili to form a full-fledged school within the University. Activities Research activities at the institute is divided into a number of sections - Lexicography, Linguistics, and Literature The Lexicography section of the institute is responsible of creation of dictionaries and terminologies for specialized areas. The first Kiswahili dictionary was compiled here in 1981. Massamba p75 In addition, specialized dictionaries have been compiled in areas such social science, language and linguistics, and science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology).Mugane p284 The Linguistics section conducts research into morphology, phonology, syntax, sociolinguistics and dialectology.Massamba 64 The first book on Swahili morphology was published in 1984. The Literature section conducts research into the oral and written literature in the Kiswahili language. The institute's purely academic role is in contrast to that of the Baraza la Kiswahili la Taifa (BAKITA), which has a more political role in advocating for Kiswahili as a means of national integration in Tanzania. As such, the responsibility for standardizing the language lies with the latter organization.Massamba p65 The institute can propose new vocabulary to respond to emerging needs but only BAKITA can approve usage.

Both Sen and Haq specify 1806; The New American Cyclopaedia specifies 1806 and Calcutta . was an Indian tax-collector and administrator of Iranian stock, notable for a memoir of his travels in Britain, Europe and Asia Minor, Masir Talib fi Bilad Afranji, written between circa 1799 and 1805. The book's title is translated as The Travels of Taleb in the Regions of Europe and was reprinted in the West as Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan in Asia, Africa and Europe; it is one of the earliest by an Indian travel writer about the West, and has been described as 'perhaps the most significant \\"reverse travelogue\\" published in Europe during the Romantic era\\". Biography Portrait of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan =Oudh and Bengal= Much of what is known of Abu Taleb's background comes from his memoirs. By his description, his father Hajji Mohammed Beg was born in Abbasabad in the Isfahan Province of Persia, but fled to Lucknow in Oudh State, northern India, in fear of the 'tyranny' of Nader Shah. There he was 'admitted to the friendship' of Safdarjung, the Subadar Nawab of Oudh and was in time appointed assistant to the deputy-governor of Oudh, Safdarjung's nephew Mohammed Culy Khan. His appointment did not survive Safdarjung's death in 1754; the new Nawab, Safdarjung's son Shuja-ud-Daula had Mohammed Culy Khan executed and Hajy Mohammed Beg Khan fled to Murshidabad, West Bengal within a couple of years of Abu Taleb's birth in Lucknow in 1752. Abu Taleb and his mother remained in Lucknow under the protection of the Nawab - \\"although Nabob Shujaa ad Dowleh was much displeased at my father's conduct, he nevertheless, recollecting the connexion between our families, supplied my mother with money for her expenses and have her strict injunctions to let me have the very best education.\\" They moved to Murshidabad in 1766, but in 1768, within about 18 months of their arrival, Hajy Mohammed Beg Khan died. Abu Taleb had been married into the family of 'Muzaffer Jung - Nabob of Bengal' and spent some time in that prince's service, remaining away from Oudh until, in 1775, after the death of Shuja-ud-Daula and the accession of his son Asaf-ud-Daula, he was invited by the prime minister, Mokhtiar-ud-Daula, to take up the position of Aumildar of the Etawah district. The role combined tax-collector, Lord-Lieutenant and local military controller, but ceased within a couple of years upon the death of Abu Taleb's patron Mokhtiar, and the appointment of Hyder Beg Khan as his replacement. Hyder Beg Khan, Asaf-ud-Daula's minister and Abu Taleb's foe Abu Taleb spent a year in Lucknow, after which he took up a first appointment with the East India Company - already well involved in Oudh affairs - to assist Colonel Alexander Hanney, the company's tax-collector at Gorakhpur; this he did for three years until Hanney returned to Europe, whereupon Abu Taleb retired again to a year of unemployment in Lucknow. Relations between the Company and Oudh were in this period strained, including during the 1781‚Äì1782 third period of Nathaniel Middleton office as Resident, and, according to Abu Taleb, the State's tax-collection system was in sufficient disarray that Zamindars, notably Balbhadra Singh, were refusing to make any payments (all Hyder Beg Khan's fault, according to Abu Taleb.) A military action by the Nawab and the Company against Singh failed (again, Hyder Beg Khan's fault!) and, Abu Taleb says, Warren Hastings, the then Governor General, instructed Middleton to send for Abu Taleb as a person who might be able to bring Singh under control. After briefly playing hard-to-get, Mizra agreed to assist and from circa 1782-1784 Abu Taleb campaigned against, defeated and killed Singh. Middleton had been withdrawn from Lucknow, and Hastings resigned in 1784, leaving Abu Taleb somewhat exposed, but surviving on an allowance from the Nawab of 6,000 rupees per annum; his b√™te noire Hyder Beg Khan was still in place and appeared to have the confidence of the new Governor General, Sir John Macpherson. By 1787, Hyder Beg Khan had stopped Abu Taleb's allowance, which precipitated a decision on Abu Taleb's part to leave Lucknow for Calcutta, the seat of East India Company government. Initial overtures to Sir Charles Cornwallis, who succeeded Macpherson as Governor General, were poorly timed; Cornwallis's attention was focussed on Tipu Sultan and the Third Anglo- Mysore War, and it was only at the 1892 conclusion of that engagement that Cornwallis responded, sending Abu Taleb back to Lucknow with letters of recommendation to Asaf-ud-Daula and George Frederick Cherry, the Resident. Abu Taleb's expectation of a resumption of employment was dashed by disagreements between the Nawab and the Resident severe enough to necessitate the withdrawal of the latter from Lucknow; in 1795 Abu Taleb again found it expedient to remove to Calcutta. Although John Shore made encouraging noises, several years of deteriorating Company relations with Oudh, the 1897 death of Asaf-ud-Daula, the brief reign of Wazir Ali Khan with its delayed culmination in the Massacre of Benares all served to render Abu Taleb unemployed, separated from his family, increasingly poor and depressed. =Khan's travels= It was at this very low period in Abu Taleb's life that, in 1799, an unexpected offer was made to him by David Thomas Richardson, an East India Company officer returning to London for health reasons. Richardson suggested that Abu Taleb accompany him and undertake a grant-tour of Europe; Abu Taleb promptly accepted. It is unclear whether Richardson's offer arose from personal friendship, or if the hand of the East India Company was involved. Tim Willasey-Wilsey suggests that the Company was making an investment in Abu Taleb with a view to his potential later utility in Oudh. This reading of the situation may rest in some small part on Charles Stewart's English language translation of Abu Taleb's Persian language travel memoir, which sees Richardson offering to pay Abu Taleb's expenses. That translation is disputed by Gita Hashemi, who translates the key passage in the book as Abu Taleb agreeing to Richardson's suggestion, but booking and paying for his own passage. Equally, it is clear that Abu Taleb was involved in the political intrigues of Oudh, and both were regarded whilst en route as having confidential motives for their travel; and the unprecedented nature of the trip is itself grounds for reasonable suspicion in the context of the Company's anticipation of annexation of Oudh State. Khan and Richardson departed Calcutta on 7 February 1799, making it as far as Cape Town in South Africa where, in despair about conditions on their ship, they remained for some months awaiting the opportunity of a more congenial conveyance; they were well-received, and came within the social circle of Lady Anne Barnard. The pair left Cape Town in late September to arrive in Cork, Ireland in December 1799. Finding that Cornwallis was now Lord Lieutenant and Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, the pair travelled overland to Dublin, where Abu Taleb visited and presumably made representations to Cornwallis. It is clear that work in the early 1770s with Nathaniel Middleton had damaged Abu Taleb's standing in Oudh, where he was depicted by rivals as supporting British interests at the cost of those of the Nawab; and it is most likely that Abu Taleb sought recompense from the company. Whilst in Dublin he also met Sake Dean Mahomed, a Bengali living in Ireland who had in 1794 published The Travels of Dean Mahomet, which perhaps served as a model for Abu Taleb's work. Supplied by Cornwallis with letters of recommendation, Abu Taleb now proceeded to London, arriving on 21 January 1800, where he remained and was to a large degree lionised by London society as The Persian Prince. He was presented to Charlotte of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, George III's queen who is said to have commanded him \\"frequently to court\\", and became a sought-after social celebrity dubbed 'The Persian Prince', whose movements and meetings were reported by newspapers. He was received by and met with the great and good, such as James Christie, John Debrett and Josiah Wedgwood; and of perhaps more moment met with key political figures such as Henry Dundas, then Secretary of State for War, and directors of the East India Company. As notably, Abu Taleb delighted in meeting with the wives and daughters of his contacts. Abu Taleb departed England on 7 June 1802, visiting France, where he met with Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy and Louis-Mathieu Langl√®s, both orientalists, and received invitations, frustrated by illness, to visit Talleyrand and Napoleon. He proceeded to Constantinople, meeting with Selim III, the Sultan and from there overland though Kurdistan and Persia, visiting the Shia shrines of Karbala and Najaf, before returning to Calcutta in August 1803. Willasey-Wilsey suggests that this leg of his journey was designed to burnish his Muslim credentials, as part of the joint Khan and Company plans for his future. Abu Taleb found himself employment upon his return as an administrator in Bundelkhand, and devoted his time to writing an account of his travels, which he circulated in very limited numbers as Masir Talib fi Bilad Afranji, before his untimely death in 1805 or 1806. Travels of Mirza Abu Taleb Khan Scan of the Persian language Masir Talib fi Bilad Afranji by Mirza Abu Taleb Khan The Persian title of the book is a play on words, employing talib - one who wishes - to contrast with Taleb and connote \\"Taleb/Talib‚Äôs trajectory\\", or \\"the path of wishfulness\\" or \\"the path of aspiration\\", and which encompasses the book's dual functions as travel guide and as a discussion of the spiritual purpose of travelling. Taleb sets out his purpose in writing the book in its preface: to describe, for the benefit of his countrymen, the 'curiosities and wonders he saw', noting that many of the 'customs, inventions, sciences and ordinances of Europe' might be used to good effect in Asia. To this end, the book both chronicles his travels, but also provides discrete chapters on subject-matter of interest to him, including \\"the arts and sciences, mechanical inventions, the lifestyles of the different classes, the system of government, the East India Company, the judiciary, the financial system, the defects of character and the virtues of the English ..on Europe [and] England's conflict with France, and ... on England's overseas conquests.\\" Amrit Sen has discussed issues of autoethnography arising in Khan's work, noting the tension between his admiration for, and criticism of, the west; and his use of the coloniser's language both to identify with Europeans but also critique them; this leading to ambiguity about Khan's \\"oriental\\" persona. He is fascinated by western engineering, factories, bridges and shipyards, and understands the link between Europe's prosperity and its industrial revolution. He praises the industry and efficiency of English people, and their honour and relative learning. Equally, he critiques the English lack of faith and a range of deplorable characteristics, such as their pride, insolence, and excessive fondness for luxury. Sen asserts that it is possible to read Abu Taleb's book as a series of comparisons praising the virtues of the east above the west: \\"the Muslims of Cape Town are kind and superior; the savages of Andaman are preferable to his European shipmates; Oxford is almost like the ancient Indian temples; the Quazis are superior to the English jury system ‚Äì which is frightening and often prone to mistakes ... Abu Taleb praises the English 'equality of all' before the law and yet proceeds to suggest that this 'equality is more in appearance than in reality'. He attacks the British legal system as corrupt and convoluted.\\" Despite such a reading, Abu Taleb's book was noticed by and promulgated by India's English colonisers: Sen notes this as \\"a fascinating insight into the operation of the colonial machinery\\" A copy of Abu Taleb's Persian language text found its way to Charles Stewart, who translated it into English and published it in 1810. A second English edition was published in 1814, and its preface recounts - in part by way of seeking to assure readers of the authenticity of the book - that the Bengal Government had caused the Persian language original to be published, 'convinced of the policy of disseminating such a work amongst the Natives of the British Dominions of the East'. Abu Taleb's son, Mirza Hussein Ali, who entered into the Company's service at Fort William College, assisted in the publication of the Persian language version, editions of which were published in 1812, 1827 and 1836. More recent versions include a 1972 reprinted by Sona Publications, New Delhi, and a contemporary edition, designed for the academic market, was published in 2008 by Broadview Press.

It has undergone numerous refurbishments during the 17th and 18th centuries. The facade was restored in 2002. On the facade are statues of the Saints Secondo, Roch, and the Archangel Michael. In the center of the facade is the original coat of arms of the town. The layout is that of a Latin Cross with a large cupola at the center of the crossing. The interior houses some 17th-century marble altars in the lateral chapels. The main altar (1866) was built in Neoclassical-style with sculpted wood angels. The chapel in the east transept houses the relics of Santa Gregoria. The fresco decoration is from the 19th century. The main organ was built by Bernasconi and inaugurated in 1902.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and urn-shaped to barrel-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia porrecta is a tree that grows to a height of but often much less, and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, tessellated greyish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped leaves that are long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, more or less the same shade of glossy green on both sides, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven, rarely nine, buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. Flowering occurs from January to April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped, barrel-shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming This bloodwood was first formally described in 1953 by Stanley Thatcher Blake who gave it the name Eucalyptus porrecta and published the description in the Australian Journal of Botany. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson changed the name to Corymbia porrecta. The specific epithet is from the Latin porrectus meaning \\"stretched outwards and forward\\", possibly referring to the long broad leaves of the crown. Distribution and habitat The grey bloodwood usually grows in tall woodland on sandy, gravelly soils in the north-west of the Northern Territory, between Litchfield and Darwin, east to Jabiru, the Coburg Peninsula and on Bathurst and Melville Islands.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1901 to 1904. Smith was born in Merino, Victoria, to Ellen (n√©e Teesdale) and George Smith.Henry Teesdale Smith ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 8 October 2016. He attended Hamilton College, and after leaving school began working for a local railway contracting firm. Smith set up his own railway contracting business in 1888, and in 1893 moved to Western Australia to build the Bunbury‚ÄìBusselton line. The following year, he became manager of an Albany timber firm, which he eventually expanded into a \\"sawmilling empire with leases and concessions along the length of the Darling Range\\". In 1902, his firm and seven others merged to form Millars Karri and Jarrah Forests Limited (known as Millars), which had a virtual monopoly over the market in Western Australia. At the 1901 state election, Smith was elected to the Legislative Assembly seat of Wellington, standing as an independent. However, he did not recontest his seat at the 1904 election, instead choosing to concentrate on his business interests. As manager of Millars, Smith faced several challenges, including a royal commission into price-fixing, a declining market, and several industrial disputes. He resigned in 1908, reputedly over a pay dispute, and left for Adelaide, where he returned to railway contracting. Outside of the timber industry, he had acquired a number of pastoral leases in Western Australia, including properties near Northam, Mount Barker, Harvey, and Wokalup. In South Australia, Smith was responsible for constructing the Gawler‚ÄìAngaston, Nurioopta‚ÄìTruro, Balhannah‚ÄìMount Pleasant, and Palmer‚ÄìSedan railway lines, as well as an electric tramway in Adelaide. In 1911, Smith also returned to Western Australia to build the Marble Bar Railway. In 1914, the federal government granted Smith the right to build a small section of the Trans-Australian Railway, running west from Port Augusta. In 1918, the state government of New South Wales contracted Smith to build a wheat silo and grain elevator at White Bay. The contract was later claimed to have been signed without appropriate safeguards, and the resulting controversy was said to have contributed to the defeat of William Holman's government at the 1920 state election. Smith lived in Adelaide in retirement, although he also had houses in Melbourne and Sydney. He died in Melbourne in February 1921 (aged 62), of a cerebral haemorrhage. He had married Lydia Kate Johnson in 1885, with whom he had five sons and a daughter.

The prabandhas contain semi-historical anecdotes about the lives of famous persons. They were written primarily by Jain scholars of western India (Gujarat and Malwa) from 13th century onwards. The prabandhas feature colloquial Sanskrit with vernacular expressions, and contain elements of folklore.  Definition  The prabandhas are semi-historical anecdotes about famous persons. The Prabandha Kosha of Rajashekhara Suri mentions two types of biographical narratives: charitas and prabandhas. It states that the charitas are the life-stories of tirthankaras, kings and religious leaders up to Aryarakshita-Suri (who died in 30 CE). The biographies of persons born after Aryarakshita-Suri are called prabandhas. It is not clear if this is Rajashekhara's own definition or if it is based on some other authority. However, several later texts do not abide by this definition. For example, there are texts titled Kumarapala-Charita, Vastupala-Charita and Jagadu- Charita about people who flourished after the end of the 1st millennium CE. Prabandhas were written primarily by Jain scholars from 13th century onwards. The authors were based in western India, and wrote primarily in colloquial Sanskrit (as opposed to Classical Sanskrit). The prabandhas make heavy use vernacular (that is, non-Sanskrit) expressions, and often appear close to the folk tradition.  Example texts  Trishashti-Shalaka-Purusha-Charitra by the 12th century Jain scholar Hemachandra contains legendary narratives about 63 persons. However, the earliest collection explicitly titled Prabandha- is Jinabhadra's Prabandhavali (1234 CE). Some of the notable Prabandha collections include: ; Prabandhavali by Jinabhadra, 1234 CE : It contains 40 prabandhas about historic personalities (most of them from western India), including Prithviraja Prabandha. It was composed at the request of Vastupala's son Jaitrasimha. : It is not available in complete form, but: :* Some of its contents have been included in Jinavijaya's 20th century collection Puratana Prabandha Samgraha :* Valabhi-Bhanga prabandha in Merutunga's Prabandha- Chintamani is also copied from Prabandhavali. :* The Padaliptacharya Prabandha and Ratna-Shravaka-Prabandha in Rajashekhara's Prabandha-Kosha are taken from Prabandhavali ; Prabhavaka Charita by Prabhachandra, 1277 CE : It covers 22 Shvetambara Jain monks from Vajrasvamin to Hemachandra, as a continuation of Hemachandra's Parishishtaparvan (or Sthaviravali-Charita). It also includes anecdotes about historical kings and poets. ; Laghu-Prabandha-Sangraha by anonymous, 13th century : It was compiled by a Gujarat-based poet between 1243 CE and 1409 CE. It contains 10 small prabandhas. ; Prabandha-Chintamani of Merutunga, 1305 CE : It contains 135 prabandhas categorized under 11 topics and 5 prakashas (sections). It is an important source of history of early medieval Gujarat. ; Vividha-Tirtha-Kalpa or Kalpa-Pradipa by Jinaprabha, 1333 CE : 44 of its 63 chapters describes the Jain pilgrimage centres, but it also includes 7 kalpas or chapters covering biographies (that is, prabandhas). ; Nabhi-nandana-jinoddhara-prabandha by Kakkas≈´ri of the Upake≈õa Gaccha, 1336 CE. : Records the renovation of the Rishabhanatha Jain temple in Shatrunjaya, and provides a history of the author's spiritual lineage (Upakesha-gaccha) ; Prabandha Kosha of Rajashekhara Suri, 1349 CE : Also known as Chaturvinshati Prabandha, it contains 24 prabandhas. The personalities covered include 10 Suris (Jain teachers), 7 kings, 4 poets, and 3 Jain laymen. ; Puratana- Prabandha-Samgraha by multiple writers, before 15th century : Also known as Prabandha-Chintamani-Samvada-Puratana-Sangraha, it contains 63 prabandhas, some borrowed from the earlier prabandha collections. In 20th century, Muni Jinavijaya found its manuscript (titled Prabandha-Sangraha) at Patan, and published it under the name Puratana-Prabandha-Sangraha. ; Kumarapala- Prabandha by Jinamandana, 1435 CE : Contains 9 prabandhas about Kumarapala, and also provides information about his predecessors and ancestors. ; Bhoja- Prabandha by Ballala (or Vallalasena), 16th century : This is a collection of stories about king Bhoja, which are historically unreliable, but provide entertainment value.

Going into the Beijing Games, Cameroon was one of a number of African countries that had yet to participate at the Paralympic Games. These countries were unable to participate because of internal development and financial problems. Cameroon's specific issues involved as they related to the 2008 Games were IPC suspension for failure to pay membership fees, and lack the NPC not having organizational governance statutes. There were other conditions specific to internal organization of disability sport in Cameroon. These included three or four organizations claiming to be the country's legitimate NPC, and conflicts between these NPCs and Cameroon's Ministry of Sports and Physical Education (MINSEP). Two Cameroon para-sportspeople that might have been eligible to represent the country at the 2008 Games included Francis Biwole Nkodo and Norbert Tsoungui.  Background  Cameroon was a member of the international Paralympic movement by the 2000s. Cameroon, along with Guatemala, Guinea, Niger, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Uganda were originally supposed to participate in the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. For a variety of reasons, all these countries withdrew before the start of the Games. They were one of a number of French speaking African countries who had not participated at a Summer Paralympic Games by 2008. Other countries included Congo and Togo, along with the English speaking countries of Liberia and Gambia, and Portuguese speaking Guinea-Bissau. This was a result of either lack of development of disability sport in the country or problems in financing international participation in disability sport.  Relationship with the IPC  Cameroon had missed out on the ability to participate at the 2004 Games in Athens and the 2008 Games in Beijing because the NPC was tardy in paying membership fees to the International Paralympic Committee and were suspended around the time of both Games. At the time that the Cameroon was trying to find a way to pay the membership fees they owed the IPC in order to participate at the 2008 Games, the NPC owed a total of around 320,000 XOF (USD$). Cameroon had hoped they could get unsuspended in time to compete in Beijing after having been re- suspended since 2005. FECASH, which was one of four organizations serving as the NPC for Cameroon, lacked any statutes. Having statutes was a then requirement of the International Paralympic Committee to be a member of the IPC in good standing.  National Paralympic Committee  Ahead of the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, it was not always clear which organization was the legitimate NPC for Cameroon. There were three or four potential candidates as the legitimate NPC: FECASH, the CPC, and two other organizations. The first was Cameroonian Sports Federation for People with Disabilities (FECASH).The name of the organization in French is ' The organization was founded in 1998. A second was Paralympic Club Cameroon (CPC)The name of the organization in French is ' which also failed to get government approval before trying to become the IPC recognized NPC. In 2008 CPC was led by President Etienne Songa. Songa challenged the government's claim of failure for recognition. Songa claimed that FECASH, as a result of owing the IPC money, notified the IPC that the CPC should be recognized as the NPC for Cameroon. Songa's statements were supported by CPC Technical Director Jean-Marie Al√©okol Mabiem√©. The third organization was founded in 2004 by a former FECASH Vice President without approval from the government. The founder subsequently moved to the United States.  Internal issues  There was internal disputes in Cameroon regarding the funding issues and the responsibility to pay the IPC. Then CPC President Etienne Songa said that the CPC had requested funds from the government to pay what they owed to the IPC by August 2008 to insure that Cameroon could participate at the 2008 Games. According to Songa, the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education (MINSEP) had never contributed to the CPC's budget, which explained why the CPC was unable to pay membership fees. Association of Sports for the Physically HandicappedThe name of the organization in French is, ' President Alexandre Epoun√© called Cameroon's absence from the 2008 Games a national embarrassment. The Ministry of Sports and Physical Education disputed some claims by the CPC regarding the reasons for the problems that left the country unable to send a team to the 2008 Games. One reason was that because there were four different committees claiming to be the CPC inside Cameroon. MINSEP also pointed out that FECASH, which was serving as the NPC for Cameroon, lacked any statutes. This undermined their claims of legitimacy in the eyes of the Ministry as having statutes was a then requirement of the International Paralympic Committee to be a member of the IPC in good standing. An anonymous source at the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education alleged to Mboa.info that the creation of an alternative NPC to FECASH was an effort by some people \\"to find issues to make money or travel. The proof is that every time they left, they did not come back.\\"  Sportspeople  One of the sportspeople that had been considered a potential participant to representing Cameroon in Beijing was athlete Francis Biwole Nkodo, whom the CPC thought had a real chance to medal in Beijing. One of the sportspeople who had been hoping to represent Cameroon at the 2008 Games was Norbert Tsoungui. He said of the reason he was unable to participate, \\"Cameroon is absent because of lack of clarity in the management of disability sport in Cameroon. It is this uncertainty which led to the suspension of the Cameroon federation.\\"  See also  *Cameroon at the 2008 Summer Olympics  Translations   References  Category:Cameroon at the Paralympics Category:Nations at the 2008 Summer Paralympics ","title":"Cameroon at the 2008 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"51902748","text":"Napier is an extinct town in Holt County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

Policies and Interventions define the methods in which health outcomes and patterns of health determinants are implemented. Policies which are helpful \\"improve the conditions under which people live\\". Interventions encourage healthy behaviors for individuals or populations through \\"program elements or strategies designed to produce behavior changes or improve health status\\". Policies and interventions are needed due to the inequalities amongst populations and the inconsistent way care is administered. Policies can include \\"necessary community and personal social and health services\\" as well as taxes on alcohol and soft drinks and implement smoking cessation policies. Interventions can include therapeutic or preventative health care and may also include actions taken by the individual or by someone on behalf of the individual. The application of population health is determined by the policies and interventions which can be implemented within an organization, city, state or country.  Common methodology  Countries, states, provinces and providers across the globe are shifting towards better systems to respond to inconsistent health outcomes, mitigate decreasing margins and replace outdated methods such as fee-for- service health delivery. Payment model reforms, including the Accountable Care Organization (ACO), provide roadmaps for healthcare reform and drive many of its constituents towards more effective and innovative means for improving health outcomes. Population health management is a common approach for resolving these challenges but it involves new methods, tools, systems and implementations to correct inefficiencies and improve health outcomes. Population health tools and computer systems include data exchange, large datasets, and advanced software which are used to supply data scientists and research teams with appropriate information which can then be used by policy makers and change agents. This method helps to set policies around population health as well as intervention strategies which are then used to respond to the needs of a population.  Policies and Policymakers  Policy for population health \\"sets priorities\\" and are a \\"guide to action to change what would otherwise occur\\". Policies are based on \\"social sciences of sociology, economics, demography, public health, anthropology, and epidemiology\\" and determine how outcomes can be accomplished are implemented at various levels. Such guides determine laws, policies, and ordinances and are defined by policymakers. Examples of policies include \\"smoking bans, excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, seat belt laws, water fluoridation, and restaurant menu labeling\\".http://www.improvingpopulationhealth.org/blog/policies-and- programs.html They may be applied to a commercial establishment such as a restaurant, business workplace or within a city or state level. Policies should be evidence based and require academic studies or research to support the approach. This will assure that the appropriate measures needed for each demographic are promoted to encourage the necessary intervention practices which can be applied to each population or to the nation as a whole. Policymakers can be classified as both private and public and are defined as someone who is in a position of authority to implement health policies. A public policy maker could be a government official and a private policymaker could be a business owner or administrator. Policymakers are influenced by, and can also be, change agents. Change agents include \\"legislators in Washington, an attorney general, regulators at the FDA, an advocacy group or other organizations that clearly have influence\\".  Political strategy  The goal for any political strategies surrounding population health is to \\"improve chances of success for policy adoption and implementation\\". Such strategies include the creation of funds to support initiatives and the construction of strategies which limit conflicts of interest in the implementation of public policy. = Tobacco Control = A political strategy implemented to limit the sale and exposure to tobacco products and restrict the tobacco company's ability to benefit politically from charitable donations is the creation of the World Health Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. The legally binding document is supported by numerous countries, government/nongovernment agencies and provides the necessary power to prevent negative influences on population health policies.  Interventions  Interventions in population health \\"shift the distribution of health risk by addressing the underlying social, economic and environmental conditions\\" and are implemented through \\"programs or policies designed and developed in the health sector, but they are more likely to be in sectors elsewhere, such as education, housing or employment\\". They are aimed at reducing such things as childhood obesity, cardiovascular disease, smoking and mental health issues throughout society. The means in which interventions are devised is through extensive research and contributions from medical scientists, researchers, and medical professionals. They are implemented by but are not limited to educators, practicing physicians, business administrators and mental health professionals.  Approaches and Implementations  A typical approach includes assessing the conditions and possible improvements which can be made within the social determinants that have been identified. Each approach is handled at a state or health plan level. One example was a workplace in China which implemented policies and interventions for their staff to fight depression. By recognizing the importance of mental health, they were able to reduce depression and improve job satisfaction across the company. The company published its research and findings to promote \\"enterprises taking more responsibility for the provision of mental health services to their employees\\". Another example was the implementation of a smoking cessation program to the province of Ontario. Studies were performed on weekly visit rates to psychiatric emergency departments before and after the implementation. The result was a \\"15.5% reduction in patient visits for patients with a primary diagnosis of psychotic disorder\\".  Inequalities and Variance of Implementation  As is the common understanding of population health, health inequalities, defined as a \\"generic term used to designate differences, variations, and disparities in the health achievements of individuals and groups\\", must be considered to correctly implement the most effective policies and interventions. Based on a population and its socioeconomic, geographic, ethnicity and other factors, policies and interventions may vary. Policies implemented for one population may be less effective and more costly than it would be for another similar population. For example, US policies tend to be more costly than European and have less impact. Research has shown that in some instances, \\"Americans had worse outcomes than their international peers\\" and also had \\"the lowest life expectancy at birth of the countries studied\\".

The Potter House, his former home overlooking Christianshavn Canal in Christianshavn, now also known as the Br√∏ste House after a later owner, is now listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. Career Born in Edinburgh to unknown parents, Thomas Potter came to Copenhagen at an early age where he obtained a royal licence to establish an iron foundry on rented land at Appelbys Plads in 1769. In 1771, his license was expanded to comprise all sorts of brass and iron products, forged as well as cast. In 1779, Potter acquired a lot fronting Christianshavn Canal, constructing the Potter House in 1785. It had offices on the ground floor, packing in the cellar and his residence on the first floor. The foundry was located to the rear of the building. It manufactured \\"iron pots in all shapes\\" as well as everything from nails and bullets to ship anchors. Some of its products were exported to both the East and West Indies. Over the years, he built a considerable export of pots, nails and forged anchors to both the East and West Indies.

Haunted by grief after the early loss of two wives in the building in just six years, Potter sold his house at Christianshavn Canal in 1790 never to set foot in the building again. On 3 May 1794 in the Garrison Church, he married Inger Dorothea Hertz, a daughter of Rotal Forester in Vordingborg County Herman Michelsen H.

Prashasti (IAST: Pra≈õasti, Sanskrit for \\"praise\\") inscriptions are euologistic inscriptions issued by Indian rulers from 1st millennium CE onwards. Written in form of poetry or ornate prose, the prashastis were generally composed by the court poets. The prashastis generally contained genealogies of the rulers (or other issuers subordinate to them), their achievements (especially military activities), their comparisons with legendary heroes and other details. The inscriptions issued by the subordinates often recognized the rulers as the descendant of a deity, and bestowed titles and honours upon them. One of the first known prashastic inscription in Sanskrit is the Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman (circa 150 CE), the first long inscription in fairly standard Sanskrit that has survived into the modern era, which became a prototype for Gupta era poetic prashastis. According to American scholar Richard G. Salomon, the inscription \\"represents a turning point in the history of epigraphic Sanskrit. This is the first long inscription recorded entirely in more or less standard Sanskrit, as well as the first extensive record in the poetic style. Although further specimens of such poetic prasastis in Sanskrit are not found until the Gupta era, from a stylistic point of view Rudradaman's inscription is clearly their prototype\\". The Tamil meykeerthi inscriptions are similar to the prashastis, but feature far more standardized formats.  Examples  * Nashik prashasti (2nd century CE), Satavahana dynasty * Prayaga prashasti (4th century CE), Gupta dynasty: Lists the rulers against whom the Gupta king Samudragupta fought.

It is a spin-off and feature-length adaptation of Amateur Night, David Bruckner's segment from the 2012 anthology horror film V/H/S. It was released on December 2, 2016 in theatres, on DVD on December 6, 2016 and on Netflix January 1, 2020. It was directed by Gregg Bishop and produced by Gary Binkow, Jude S. Walko, Brad Miska, and David Bruckner. One week before his wedding day, Jonah and his groomsmen hit the town for a wild night of club hopping and debauchery. But the party becomes a savage fight for survival when they unwittingly unleash a fabled predator upon the festivities. Plot One week before his wedding day, Jonah and his groomsmen hit the town for his stag party, hosted by his irresponsible brother Mac. Attempting to be more original, Mac takes them to Garden City instead of a typical party location hoping for a wild night, and instead they wind up at a lackluster strip club. Visibly disappointed at his efforts, Mac attracts the attentions of a stranger who tells him about an underground moving club that promises to surpass all expectations. Reluctantly, Jonah agrees to go, but the long drive to 50n/40w through a dark forest unnerves the group, as does the club when they finally arrive. The patrons and dancers almost convince the group to leave until the club owner, Mr. Nyx, comes out to personally welcome and see to their entertainment. Upon hearing that Jonah wants a non-cheating experience, Nyx takes him into another room and tells him to go to the window at the end while his groomsmen pay. He asks from each of the three men their favorite memories of their mothers. At the window, Jonah sees a nude young woman on the other side of the glass who begins singing. Jonah suddenly relives all the sexual encounters he's ever had at once. Meanwhile, at the main bar, one of the groomsmen, Elliot, has a custom drink with a leech in it and suddenly experiences the memory of murdering someone, after which both Mac and Rand realize they all have matching marks on the back of their necks. After leaving the window, Jonah hears the girl ask him not to leave and sees that the door to the room is padlocked from the outside. Fearing that the girl is a sex slave, Jonah gets Rand, tells the others to get to the car, and the two break the lock and let her out using the swiss army knife that Jonah gave them as groomsmen gifts. While attempting to sneak out of the club, the three get waylaid by guards and hide in a bathroom. Once there, the girl uses the keys she stole from one of the guards to open a shackle around her ankle, then brutally kills the guard that followed them, revealing claws and a long tail. Jonah and Rand run for the car and the four drive away, only for the girl to suddenly land on the roof and cause them to crash. While the girl grabs Elliot and drags him off, Nyx and his posse arrive and kidnap Rand as Jonah and Mac escape. Back at the club, Nyx questions Rand, asking why they released \\"Lilith\\" before allowing the brother of the murdered guard to torture him. Out in the woods, Jonah and Mac desperately try to find Elliot while arguing over who's to blame for the way the night has gone. Jonah realizes that the girl had sniffed him after being released, and had gone after Elliot because he has been wearing his jacket. The two attempt to cover their scent, managing to escape and find their way to a diner patroned by a pair of cops. They desperately try to describe the past few hours and the cops cuff them, Mac noticing in alarm that they have the same mark on the backs of their necks, realizing that they work for Nyx. The girl arrives at the diner and starts to sing, entrancing the cop with Jonah who quickly puts in his headphones to drown her out, watching as she murders both cops. Chasing him through the diner, the girl reveals a demonic face, announcing \\"I like you\\" before grabbing Jonah and flying away. Back at the club, Nyx orders one of his minions, who appears to be some sort of Gorgon, to take a very injured Rand's memories of being tortured, hunt down Jonah, and give them to him. The minion does this by taking a medusa-like leech from her head and inserting into then removing it from the mark on the back of his neck, revealing what had happened earlier when paying for Jonah's session and what had happened with Elliot, implying that part of Nyx's business is selling people memories. Back with Jonah, he and the girl land in a quarry, and after a few attempts to escape, she rapes him while singing, again creating a fantasy of him having sex with his fiance, Eva, and then forms her tail into a penile shape and inserts into his rectum to make him impregnate her. When he comes back to himself, Jonah runs from the now sleeping girl and makes it back to his hotel room where the minion is waiting for him. She forces him to drink the leech she took earlier and Jonah relives Rand's torture and the memory of Nyx speaking directly to him and offering a trade; the girl for Rand. All he has to do is go to a church and the girl will follow him. Jonah agrees and follows the minion to the church. Once there, a few things become clearer. The girl, Lily, is actually a demon from hell (a succubus to be exact) that was summoned years ago, imprisoned by Nyx, and forced to become a sex slave. Lily had become infatuated with Jonah because he was kind and helped her escape. Succubi mate for life and Lily wants him to stay with her, killing anyone who gets in her way. The church is the location where she was originally summoned and Nyx needs Jonah to lure her into a rune circle and reattach the shackle around her ankle to bind her to his will again, as he is the only person she won't kill. Lily arrives and hesitantly steps into the circle. Jonah apologizes to Lily he made a mistake when he released her, letting her know he wasn't aware it was a trap. To Nyx's anger, Jonah makes a new deal with Lily; he won't put the shackle on if she will let Jonah go. Lily agrees, and proceeds to slaughter Nyx and his henchmen, while Jonah grabs a seriously injured Rand. Mac arrives and sacrifices himself saving his brother from a vengeful Nyx. Lily kisses Jonah goodbye, and watches from above the church doors while Jonah and Rand leave. A year later, Jonah and Eva are married. Eva states that she wants to start their special evening soon because she is getting sleepy as she takes a drink of her wine. They make love on their anniversary. Jonah goes to get a glass of water afterwards and sees Eva asleep on the couch, realizing that he had made love to Lily and not Eva. Jonah attempts to get Lily to leave and almost succeeds, until Eva notices Lily and starts to scream, whereupon Lily starts to attack her. Jonah begs her to stop and says he will go with her. Lily grabs Jonah and they fly off into the night, Eva hysterically screaming after them.

The film's budget was $300k and was scheduled for 18 days. Locations shot primarily in Savannah, GA and Augusta, GA. David Bruckner directed the second unit for the movie upon the request of director Gregg Bishop. Even though the studio was pushing for other actresses for the role of Lily, director Gregg Bishop insisted that Hannah Fierman reprise her role from V/H/S. Justin Welborn was cast as Mr. Nyx, who also starred in David Bruckner's film The Signal and Gregg Bishop's film Dance of the Dead. For the parts of the movie where Lily sings, the filmmakers decided in pre-production to utilize Hannah Fierman's singing voice. The plan was always to have her lip sync to a guide track for the first take to just get the melody and timing of the song (never intending to use that take), then in the following takes they would have her sing it for real. It is Hannah Fierman's singing voice in the final film. Post production was rushed and as a result several final visual FX shots were not approved by the director because the post house had to cut them in and deliver the movie. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 65% of 20 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review. Ain‚Äôt It Cool News called SiREN a ‚Äúrock solid monster movie with a strong ensemble cast‚Äù, the Los Angeles Times hailed it a ‚Äúclever and confident expansion of a terrific short.‚Äù, We Are Indie Horror called it a \\"phenomenal and intense adaptation of ‚ÄúAmateur Night‚Äù that far surpasses the short in tone and action.

Deep sequencing refers to the general concept of aiming for high number of unique reads of each region of a sequence.  Rationale  Even though the sequencing accuracy for each individual nucleotide is very high, the very large number of nucleotides in the genome means that if an individual genome is only sequenced once, there will be a significant number of sequencing errors. Furthermore, many positions in a genome contain rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Hence to distinguish between sequencing errors and true SNPs, it is necessary to increase the sequencing accuracy even further by sequencing individual genomes a large number of times. = Ultra-deep sequencing = The term \\"ultra-deep\\" can sometimes also refer to higher coverage (>100-fold), which allows for detection of sequence variants in mixed populations. In the extreme, error-corrected sequencing approaches such as Maximum-Depth Sequencing can make it so that coverage of a given region approaches the throughput of a sequencing machine, allowing coverages of >10^8. = Transcriptome sequencing = Deep sequencing of transcriptomes, also known as RNA-Seq, provides both the sequence and frequency of RNA molecules that are present at any particular time in a specific cell type, tissue or organ. Counting the number of mRNAs that are encoded by individual genes provides an indicator of protein-coding potential, a major contributor to phenotype. Improving methods for RNA sequencing is an active area of research both in terms of experimental and computational methods.  Calculation  The average coverage for a whole genome can be calculated from the length of the original genome (G), the number of reads (N), and the average read length (L) as N\\\\times L/G . For example, a hypothetical genome with 2,000 base pairs reconstructed from 8 reads with an average length of 500 nucleotides will have 2√ó redundancy. This parameter also enables one to estimate other quantities, such as the percentage of the genome covered by reads (sometimes also called breadth of coverage). A high coverage in shotgun sequencing is desired because it can overcome errors in base calling and assembly. The subject of DNA sequencing theory addresses the relationships of such quantities.  Physical coverage  Sometimes a distinction is made between sequence coverage and physical coverage. Where sequence coverage is the average number of times a base is read, physical coverage is the average number of times a base is read or spanned by mate paired reads.

It contains one species, Austroposeidon magnificus.  Description  First dorsal vertebra Austroposeidon was a large sauropod in fact, the largest dinosaur discovered in Brazil to date, with the only known specimen, an adult, having a length of about . Several traits show that Austroposeidon was a member of the titanosaurs; the hyposphene-hypantrum articulations are missing from the vertebrae, the cervical and dorsal vertebrae do not have forked neural spines, and the internal texture of the bone is camellate (punctuated by many small air chambers). The describers determined that Austroposeidon was a new genus based on a number of autapomorphies (or traits unique to the known fossils) in the vertebrae: the thirteenth cervical vertebra has columnar centropostzygapophyseal laminae, and its rear centrodiapophyseal lamina splits into two prongs; the first dorsal vertebra has front and back centrodiapophyseal laminae that curve downwards and outwards, and its diapophysis stretches down to the top margin of the centrum; and the frontmost part of the spinoprezygapophyseal laminae forks in the dorsal vertebrae positioned towards the back of the torso. Additionally, Austroposeidon possesses a unique combination of other vertebral traits, not seen elsewhere among titanosaurs. A CT scan showed that the internal bone texture of the vertebrae possessed concentric, alternating rings of camellate tissue and dense tissue; the describers interpreted these as rings of growth within the bone.  Discovery and naming  Austroposeidon is known from a single specimen, MCT 1628-R, which consists portions of the cervical (neck), dorsal, and sacral vertebrae (including a cervical rib and one complete dorsal vertebra). The specimen was discovered in the Campanian-Maastrichtian Presidente Prudente Formation of the Bauru Group by palaeontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price in 1953, but the remains were not described until 2016. The animal was likely preserved by a crevasse splay on a floodplain, judging by the fine sandstone that the specimen was found in. Unfortunately, the site where the specimen was recovered has now been lost to urban development. The genus name combines austro (\\"southern\\", as in South America, from Latin Auster, the southern wind) and poseidon, a reference to the Greek god of earthquakes of the same name. The specific name is the Latin word magnificus (\\"great, elevated, noble\\"), referring to the large size of the specimen.  Classification  Cervical rib Thirteenth neck vertebra A phylogenetic analysis in 2016 recovered Austroposeidon as the sister taxon of the Lognkosauria.

The two groups were previously allied during the 2016 Hama offensive, but sporadic clashes also occurred time by time. The clashes Tensions between the two groups initiated on 4 October, when Ahrar al-Sham captured a Jund al-Aqsa member accused of being a cell for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In response, Jund al-Aqsa militants kidnapped an Ahrar al-Sham member, beat his wife, and shot his brother. Both sides called for the release of their captured members and threatened military action. The conflict escalated on 6 October, as clashes broke out throughout the Idlib Governorate and the northern Hama Governorate. Jund al-Aqsa captured all Ahrar al-Sham positions in the town of Khan Shaykhun and attacked them in northern Hama, while Ahrar al-Sham expelled the former from Maarat al-Nu'man and 4 other villages in Idlib. 800 fighters from Ahrar al-Sham and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham defected to Jund al-Aqsa during the clashes. As a reaction to the clashes, several other rebel groups signed a statement announcing that they would side with Ahrar al- Sham against Jund al-Aqsa in the conflict. The signatory groups were: Jaysh al-Islam, Suqour al-Sham Brigade, Sham Legion, Army of Mujahideen, Fatah Halab, and Fastaqim Union. On 8 October, clashes between the two groups spread to a village in Jabal Zawiya, and a senior military commander of Ahrar al-Sham was killed. The next day, in an attempt to end the conflict and find protection, Jund al-Aqsa pledged its allegiance to the al-Qaeda-affiliated al- Nusra Front (also known as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham). However, clashes continued in Idlib, after Ahrar al-Sham rejected the move and vowed to continue fighting Jund al-Aqsa. Two days later, a ceasefire agreement was signed between Jund al-Aqsa, Ahrar al-Sham, and al-Nusra. However, clashes between the two groups soon erupted again in Idlib. In addition, Jund al-Aqsa, along with al-Nusra, reportedly attacked a base of Ahrar Al-Sham in the town of Tahtaya. Meanwhile, 150 Jund al-Aqsa fighters reportedly defected to ISIL as result of the rebel infighting and their group's pledge to the al-Nusra Front. On 13 October, the general commander of Ahrar al-Sham announced the \\"end\\" of Jund al-Aqsa. Aftermath On 22 October, Jund al-Aqsa as part of Jabhat Fatah al-Sham attacked Ahrar al-Sham's headquarter in Sarmin. In January 2017, the al-Nusra Front launched several coordinated attacks against Ahrar al-Sham headquarters and positions in the northern Idlib Governorate, near the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. In addition, al-Nusra also attacked Ahrar al-Sham outposts in Darkush and Jisr al-Shughur. On 20 January, Jund al-Aqsa raided an Ahrar al- Sham prison in the Zawiya Mountain and freed 13 of their prisoners. Meanwhile, in the same area, al-Nusra attacked the Mountain Hawks Brigade of the Free Idlib Army, and captured a commander and his equipment.

The video of the incident was circulated on the social media resulting in statewide protests in following months. Forty-three people including four police officers were arrested and the case is under trial since August 2018. Background = Cow vigilantism = In September 2015, Mohammed Akhlaq was lynched to death in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh by people who suspected that he had beef in his fridge. In March 2016, Mustain Abbas was killed in Haryana while transporting newly purchased bullocks to use on his fields. His family said that the police was threatening them instead of helping them get justice. Mustain Abbas was allegedly killed by the cow protection group called Gau Raksha Dal in Kurukshetra, Haryana. On 27 March Abbas was the only one out of his friends to not escape the Gau Raksha Dal when confronted after purchasing a cow to plow the fields. Mustain‚Äôs family filed police reports but they went unheard, and the case was passed from court to court. On 2 April the family received a call to identify a body that had been found in a ditch. Abbas's wounds consisted of stab wounds, a mutilated face, broken limbs, and he was wearing clothes different to the day of the original capturing. Evidence suggested he had gone through torture, and was given no chance to prove his innocence. In the same month, two Muslim cattle traders including a 12-year-old boy were hanged from a tree in Latehar, Jharkhand by a group claiming to be cow protectors. The police had been ignoring several complaints from the Muslim community against local cow vigilante groups. In June 2016, three people accused of transporting cows were thrashed by a mob of around 150 claiming to be gau rakshaks (cow protectors) in Rajasthan's Pratapgarh district. Other instances with alleged \\"Cow Protectors\\" include the burning of Zahid Ahmed, 19 years old, in his truck (in Jammu and Kashmir), and Khushnood Khan was killed on his way to vote. Khan was from the same village as Abbas. Zahid was accused of allegedly slaughtering a cow, and Khan was accused of allegedly consuming beef. Una incident On 11 July 2016, the seven members of a Dalit family were skinning the carcasses of dead cow in Mota Samadhiyala village near Una in Gir Somnath district of Gujarat state of India. They had bought the carcass from Bediya village. They were approached by persons in two cars who claimed to be member of cow protection group and accused them of killing cows. Dalits tried to convince them that they were skinning dead cows. They were not convinced and tied Dalits to the car and beat them with sticks, iron pipes and a knife. Four of them were brought to Una town in car and stripped and assaulted again in public. When police arrived, the attackers fled in their car. The assault was recorded on video and circulated on social media. The Dalits were moved to hospital in Una and later to Rajkot civil hospital on 14 July. Aftermath = Protests = The videos of thrashing went viral on internet and sparked the protests across the state. On 12 July 2016, a huge protest rally was at first organized in Chandkheda area in Ahmedabad by various Dalit leaders in which more than 2,000 Dalits attended and blocked the state highway. On 13 July 2016, hundreds on Dalits hold protest rally against the incident and later occupied Trikon Baug, the main square in Una for an hour. On 21 July, the issue was discussed in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament. The protests spread across Saurashtra region. Twelve Dalit youth attempted suicide in protest across the region and one of them died. Twelve people including seven police personnel were injured in the protest and one of them died. Bystanders who attempted to interfere were also beaten. Jignesh Mevani, an activist, led the protest march called Dalit Asmita Yatra from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on 15 August 2016 which was attended by some 20,000 Dalits, including women, who took a pledge to give up their traditional jobs of removing cow carcasses. He demanded the land for upliftment of Dalits. In August 2016, 10 Dalits were injured and vehicles were torched when a mob attacked them returning from Una after attending a flag-hoisting ceremony to mark the end their 10-day Azadi Kooch (freedom march). The government denied the incident. The government had filed 74 cases against the protesters. Other incident On 25 April 2018, two of the victims of the Una incident were again attacked by one of the accused who was out on bail. They were returning from shopping in Una in preparation for their conversion to Buddhism. Arrests The Gujarat Crime Investigation Department (CID) arrested 43 people in September 2016 including two minors and four police officers. Later, 35 of them were released on bail and one arrested police officer died of jaundice in September 2017. The prime accused was released on bail on the condition of not entering the limits of Una. Thirty-four of them were charged for attempt to murder, robbery, kidnapping, assault to dishonour person, wrongful confinement, rioting, hurting by weapon and criminal conspiracy. They were also charged for atrocities and recording the video of the incident. The charge sheet was filed in December 2016. The trial started in August 2018.  Government response  Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel visited Mota Samadhiyala and promised that the victims would be given Below Poverty Line cards, housing plots, five-acre agricultural land and government jobs. However, in 2018, the BJP government told the Gujarat Legislative Assembly that there was no record of the promises. Jignesh Mevani, who had asked the question in the Assembly, accused the state government of reneging on its promise. The victims had protested with hunger strike against the government and sought mercy killing for not fulfilling the promise. In popular culture The 2019 Hindi film Article 15 portrayed the flogging incident.

He ran for parliament eight times in total, but won election only twice. Early life Langsford was born in Adelaide to Mary Ann (n√©e Ware) and John Langsford. He attended Prince Alfred College, and after leaving school found work with the AMP Society (an insurance firm). In 1884, Langsford was sent to Western Australia to work in the company's Perth office. He left AMP in 1896 to set up his own business as an accountant and auditor.Joseph Wood Langsford ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 15 June 2016. In the late 1890s, he became one of the leading advocates for the creation of a new Claremont Municipality (now the Town of Claremont) out of the existing Claremont Road District (now the City of Nedlands).\\"CLAREMONT'S GROWTH\\", The West Australian, 1 January 1947. This was accomplished in 1898, and the following year Langsford was elected the inaugural Mayor of Claremont. He held that position until 1901, when he was succeeded by Sydney Stubbs, and later served on the municipal council from 1903 to 1906. Politics Langsford first stood for parliament at the 1901 state election, running for the Legislative Assembly, but was defeated by William Sayer (the attorney-general) in the newly created seat of Claremont. At the 1902 Claremont by-election, caused by Sayer's resignation, Langsford placed third behind John Foulkes and Frank Wilson. He eventually entered parliament at a 1904 Legislative Council by-election, replacing William Brookman in Metropolitan-Suburban Province. Langsford was re-elected in 1906, but resigned a few months before the end of his second term to contest the Legislative Assembly at the 1911 state election. He again ran in Claremont, but lost to Evan Wisdom, with both candidates standing as Ministerialists. In 1912, Langsford attempted to return to his previous Legislative Council seat, but was defeated by Archibald Sanderson. He recontested Claremont at the 1914 election, but again lost to Wisdom. His final run for parliament came at the 1918 Claremont by-election, where he ran as an independent but was defeated by Thomas Duff. Later life Outside of business and politics, Langsford served for periods as treasurer of Methodist Ladies' College and chairman of the board of trustees of Karrakatta Cemetery.

Early life Costello was born on April 30, 1927 in Boston. He graduated from Cathedral High School and went on to attend the College of the Holy Cross, where he majored in political science, played end for the Holy Cross Crusaders football team, and was a member of the school's swim team. Political career =Massachusetts House of Representatives= In 1950, while a senior at Holy Cross, Costello ran for one of the 18th Suffolk district seats in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. The 18th Suffolk district consisted of Costello's home neighborhood of Jamaica Plain, as well as Forest Hills and Roslindale. During the final month of the primary race, he practiced football in the afternoon and campaigned at night. He finished second out of sixteen candidates in the Democratic primary, which secured him a spot on the general election ballot and, due to the 18th Suffolk being a strong Democratic district, was tantamount to election. During his first year in the legislature, Costello attended class during the day, worked at the state house during the afternoon, and studied at night. Costello remained in the House for ten years and for a time was a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. While a member of the House, Costello earned a law degree from the Suffolk University Law School. =Massachusetts Governor's Council= In 1961, he was selected by the Massachusetts General Court to fill a vacancy on the Massachusetts Governor's Council caused by Edward J. Cronin's appointment as clerk of the Newton District Court. He was chosen over fellow representative Anthony Colonna 25 votes to 5 in the Senate and 125 to 99 in the House. Costello was elected to the Council in his own right in 1962 and reelected in 1964. =Campaigns for Lieutenant Governor= On May 18, 1964, Costello announced his candidacy for Lieutenant Governor. He was one of fourteen candidates going into the Democratic convention and won the party's endorsement on the fifth ballot by defeating Worcester attorney and Industrial Accident Board member Joseph E. McGuire 724 votes to 691 after five rounds of balloting. None of Costello's convention opponents chose to run in the primary and he won the nomination unopposed. In the general election, Costello was defeated by Republican Elliot Richardson 50% to 49%. In 1966, Costello was again a candidate for Lieutenant Governor. However, this time the convention endorsement was won by McGuire, who defeated Costello, John J. McGlynn, and John F. Dever Jr. after only two rounds balloting. Costello chose to drop out of the race after the convention. =Attempted comeback= In 1998, Costello ran for his old seat on the Governor's Council.

The campus contains one large and a few smaller cafeterias, as well as two dorms. Furthermore, a planetarium, called the Mediendom, a museum of computers and a star observatory are associated with Fachhochschule. Organization =Departments= The Fachhochschule Kiel is divided in the following departments: * Agriculture * Computer Science and Electrical Engineering * Manufacturing Systems Engineering * Media * Social Work * Economics =Courses= 38 different courses of studies are offered in the six different departments. Therefrom, 19 are Bachelor courses. Beneath typical courses like Economics and Social Work, there are also two maritime ones: Naval architecture and Technology and Offshore Technology which can only be studied at the FH Kiel. International Relationships All courses of studies are embossed by a strong international orientation. An integrated education of language in certain courses is only one example. The Fachhochschule Kiel is in close contact to international universities. Thereby many student exchange programs as well as mutual recognition of study performances can be provided. The International Office is coordinating approximately 530 students from over 80 different countries, organized by the Erasmus Programme. Besides these efforts the Fachhochschule Kiel offers two entirely English-taught master's programs, Master of Science in Information Engineering and MASTER of INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING. The latter is an online degree programme. Art and Cultural Features of the Campus The centre of culture and communication Bunker D. On the roof the Kubus Balance sculpture can be seen. After having acquired three art pieces in 1994 due to wish of the Ministry of Education, Science and Cultural Affairs to present the Campus of the University of Applied Sciences it started to expand the collection more and more. Today more than 300 pieces of art can be found under the title of ‚ÄúCampusKunst-D 450 Kunstwerke‚Äù (CampusArt-D 450 pieces of art) on the Campus.

The plugins are small programs working with the object tree. After the core has transformed a CSS string into an object tree, the plugins analyze and change the tree. Then PostCSS generates a new CSS string for the plugin- changed tree. PostCSS and its plugins are written in JavaScript and distributed through npm, which offer APIs for low-level JavaScript operations. There are official tools making it possible to use PostCSS with build systems such as Webpack,postcss-loader Gulp,gulp-postcss and Grunt.grunt-postcss There is also a console interface available.postcss-cli Browserify or Webpack can be used to open PostCSS in a browser.Running postcss in the browser = Syntaxes = PostCSS allows changing the parser and generator. In this case, PostCSS could be used to work with the Lesspostcss-less and SCSSpostcss-scss sources. However, PostCSS on its own cannot compile Sass or Less to CSS. What it does is change the original files ‚Äî for instance, by sorting the CSS properties or checking the code for mistakes. PostCSS supports SugarSS.  Plugins  PostCSS plugins perform different CSS processing tasks ranging from analysis and properties sorting to minification.

February 28, 2013, TJ expressed it in public. March 14, 2013, Andrey Sitnik's front-end work for Evil Martians resulted in Autoprefixer, a Rework-based plugin. Initially, the plugin name was rework- vendors. As Autoprefixer grew, Rework could no longer to meet its needs. September 7, 2013, Andrey Sitnik started to develop PostCSS based on the Rework ideas. In 3 months, the first PostCSS plugin, grunt-pixrem was released. December 22, 2013, Autoprefixer version 1.0 migrated to PostCSS.[ For PostCSS, the primary style focus is alchemy. The project logo represents the philosopher's stone. Major and minor PostCSS versions get their names after the Ars Goetia demons. For instance, version 1.0.0 is called Marquis Decarabia. The term postprocessor has caused some confusion. The PostCSS team used the term to show that PostCSS was not a template language (preprocessor) but a CSS tool. However, some developers think the term postprocessor would better suit browser tools (for instance, -prefix-free).The Trouble With Preprocessing Based on Future Specs The situation has become even more complicated after the release of PreCSS. Now, instead of postprocessor, the PostCSS team use the term processor.

History The predecessor of the present church was a Romanesque brick basilica with side aisles, a central nave, choir, main apse and side apses. It was in existence by 1188. Parts of this original building were reused in the construction of the present church. The transept of the former building gave the width of the new nave, on the north side of which two Romanesque windows are to be found together with part of the original stone walls of the previous building. The construction of the existing building has been credited to Emperor Charles IV, who lived in Tangerm√ºnde between 1373 and 1378. Charles actually founded a house of Augustinian Canons, to which he gave the church as a source of income. The canons conducted the choral services and attended to the side altars. It is not now generally held that the Emperor commissioned the rebuilding of the church. During the late Middle Ages the construction took place in several phases of today's tripe-aisled Gothic hall church. Firstly, after 1350, the northern wall of the nave and the southern wall with alcoves were built, and in about 1405, the roof and the rib vaults. The prominent octagonal pillars are unusual. The south tower remains uncompleted to this day. In 1450 work began on the construction of the new choir, followed by the outside walls of the new ambulatory and also the arms of the transept. Only then was the old choir removed. The inside of the choir and the ambulatory are divided by compound piers consisting of massive circular columns each with four ancillary shafts, which support the prominent vaulting. The choir was roofed in 1475. In 1617, a city-wide fire damaged the church building and the top part of the north tower collapsed. It was not restored until after 1714, when the tower received its present Baroque roof, the wooden structure of which was completely refurbished at the end of the 20th century. The fire of 1617 also caused destruction to the interior of the church: the galleries, pulpit, choir stalls and the organ had all to be restored, and the damaged altar was not replaced until 1705. Description The largely original 17th-century furnishing of the church interior is noteworthy. The colourful late Gothic interior design has been reconstructed. The stone pulpit dates from 1619. It has been attributed to the sculptor Christoph Dehne of Magdeburg and clearly shows the influence of both the late Renaissance and the Mannerist styles. It includes a figure of Moses as the pulpit bearer, holding the Tables of the Law, as well as three-dimensional sculptural figures of the apostles and reliefs depicting central Bible subjects. In 1705, the main Baroque altarpiece was introduced; it is extremely large, and unique in its sheer size in the Altmark region. The three-storey wooden structure has doors for the Holy Communion procession. The main level shows Moses and John the Baptist standing to either side of a Crucifixion. Saint Peter and Saint Paul attend Christ, who is portrayed as the Lion of Judah. The north side of the nave contains a wooden gallery, the railing of which contains 41 painted panels showing scenes from Genesis, the stories of the Patriarchs and the story of Joseph. Under these early Baroque paintings are the names and house marks of the benefactors. The chapel in the north arm of the transept is dedicated to those who died during the two world wars. Opposite the chapel entrance is hung a painting of 1697 of \\"Christ before the High Council\\" on the back wall of the choir stalls. The bronze baptismal font dates from 1508. =Organ= The Baroque organ of 1624 by Hans Scherer the Younger and his brother Fritz Scherer, which is still played, is especially noteworthy. Its design, consisting of a main organ, a R√ºckpositiv and bass pipes, is a clear example of the Scherers' construction technique known as the \\"Hamburg Prospekt\\". In 1994 it was restored by the company Alexander Schuke Potsdam Orgelbau. The organ, which had been altered several times in its history, was restored to its original acoustic pattern, which was possible as 50% of the original pipes were still in place. The instrument is tuned in a mid-tone. =Bells= The bells made by Herman Grosse in 1869 were originally a set of four. The smallest one, weighing 1,083 lbs, was destroyed during World War I. In 1949, when the bells were re-hung after World War II, they were replaced in their original wooden yokes. In 1961, the bells were attached to an offset steel yoke. During an extensive refurbishment in 2010, the bells were turned 90 degrees into what has been their original position. Straight yokes and new clappers were also incorporated. The biggest bell has been placed at the central part of the building in a valuable bell frame of 1767. The two smaller ones, weighing 4,460 lbs. and 2,880 lbs respectively, each of them in its respective bell frame, have been hung in the north and south towers. Since the year 2000 the hourly chimes have been sounded by a cup-shaped bell located in the open bell tower.

Cygnaeus was an influential figure in Finnish art and literature, contributed to Finnish nationalism and was a central person in the Fennoman movement (Fennomani). Biography Cygnaeus was born at H√§meenlinna, Finland. He was the son of Zacharias Cygnaeus and Margaret Karolina Aejmalaeus. He was born in wealthy aristocratic family, his grandfather and father were both bishops, and his father was invited to St. Petersburg as a bishop for the Lutheran parishes. Fredrik Cygnaeus attended schools in St. Petersburg, learned foreign languages and received European influences. In 1823 he returned to Finland and attended Imperial Alexander University in Turku. He graduated as a Master of Philosophy in 1832 and taught in schools in Hamina (1833‚Äì1837) and Helsinki (1839‚Äì1843). Cygnaeus traveled extensively in Europe 1843‚Äì1847 with support of a stipendium. His was planning to find documents of Swedish history in archives in France and Italy. He used the opportunity to network with Europeans, attend theatre and read literature. He also wrote poetry and newspaper articles from his travels. After his return to Finland, Cygnaeus was an acting university professor of history between 1848 and 1853. At the university, he often acted as a link between university students and administration, to channel raising nationalism to peaceful expressions and avoid revolutions. The tradition of Flora day celebrations of university students was founded under his leadership by him on May 13th 1848. When students became more radical, they did not accept Cygnaeus as their curator any more, but the administration awarded him with a professorship in modern literature in 1854. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of History and Linguistics from the beginning of 1856. In 1867 he retired as emeritus. Cygnaeus served as chairman of the Finnish Literature Society 1863-1878. He considered himself most of all as a historian and a poet. For the later world, his contribution as supporter of arts and artists has been more significant. Cygnaeus was the first one who wrote analysis of central works of Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804‚Äì1877). He also supported the works of authors Aleksis Kivi (1834‚Äì1872) and Zacharias Topelius (1818‚Äì1898). Cygnaeus Gallery Cygnaeus had his summer residence in the Kaivopuisto neighbourhood in the centre of Helsinki. It was built as a villa in 1869-1870 to designs by architect J.F.W. Mieritz. Cygnaeus donated the villa to the Finnish nation in his testament. He had also gathered a remarkable collection of art and curiosities, which he also donated to people of Finland. The collection was presented in his villa now known as the Cygnaeus Gallery. The gallery contains ca. 200 works, mainly Finnish art from the 19th century. Cygnaeus Gallery is owned by the National Museum of Finland under the authority of the National Board of Antiquities.

It is alleged that Mr. Tauber ‚Äì who was at that time member of the CDU and the (regional) chairman of the Young Union in Hesse ‚Äì was involved in (attempted) bullying of another member and employee of the CDU. The eight pages long paper \\"Operation Kaninchenjagd\\" has no date but it is undisputed by all and supported by the content that it was created in 2006 after the election of Tom Zeller as new local chairman of the CDU in the Main-Kinzig district and the paper is addressed to him by the salutation \\"Lieber Tom\\" (Dear Tom). In an early interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau, Tom Zeller implied that Sebastian Zimmer or Peter Tauber or both were the authors of the paper.Auf die Frage, wer das Papier ‚ÄûOperation Kaninchenjagd‚Äú geschrieben habe, antwortet Zeller: ‚ÄûDer Sebastian und der Peter.

German TV-Report In: :de:Hessenschau, 28 September 2016.

It derives its name from its main ingredient, Tapioca which is known as 'kappa' in Malayalam. Kappa pappadam is usually served as a snack or as an accompaniment to a rice based meal. A 2017 film starring Fahadh Fazil is also titled Kappa Pappadam.  Ingredients and preparation  The key ingredient, tapioca, is spiced with red chili, peppers, salt, cumin and asafoetida. The red chili is responsible for the characteristic brownish-orange color of kappa pappadam. Some variants appear white in color owing to the replacement of red chili with green chili. The tapioca is diced and ground with chili, pepper, cumin and water to form a fine paste. This paste is further boiled with salt, asafoetida, coconut oil and more water till it thickens. It is then spread out in circles on a cheesecloth or plastic sheet and is allowed to dry in the sun. Traditionally, a straw mat was used to dry the pappadams. After a few hours the pappadams are peeled and the sides reversed. After 2-3 days of good sunlight, the pappadams become crisp, indicating that they are ready to be fried. The dried pappadams are then deep fried in oil and served. For those who wish to refrain from deep fried dishes, the pappadams can be coated with minimal oil and microwaved for one minute.  Storage  Once completely dried, the pappadams can to stored in an airtight container for over a year. Their long shelf life implies that these pappadams are produced in bulk in summer and are utilized for the rest of the year. The pappadams are also sold as packages containing 50-100 pieces/pack.  Regional variants  Maracheeni Appalam is a variant of Kappa pappadam that is more popular in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Some variants contain rice in addition to the tapioca as the main ingredient.

At its core, a probability distribution is an instance of the class thereof, a specialization of the class of mathematical objects. A distribution relates to a number of other individuals, which are instances of various categories in the ontology. For example, these are parameters and related functions associated with a given probability distribution. This strategy allows for the rich representation of attributes and relationships between domain objects. The ontology can be seen as a conceptual schema in the domain of mathematics and has been implemented as a PowerLoom knowledge base.MacGregor R. et al. (1997) Powerloom Manual. ISI, University of South California, Marina del Rey. An OWL version is generated programmatically using the Jena API.McBride B. (2001) Jena: Implementing the RDF model and syntax specification.

The OWL version of ProbOnto is available via Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)ProbOnto on Ontology Lookup Service, URL: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/probonto to facilitate simple searching and visualization of the content. In addition the OLS API provides methods to programmatically access ProbOnto and to integrate it into applications. ProbOnto is also registered on the BioSharing portal.ProbOnto on BioSharing, the database of biological databases, URL: https://biosharing.org/biodbcore-000772  ProbOnto in PharmML  A PharmML interface is provided in form of a generic XML schema for the definition of the distributions and their parameters. Defining functions, such as probability density function (PDF), probability mass function (PMF), hazard function (HF) and survival function (SF), can be accessed via methods provided in the PharmML schema. = Use example = This example shows how the zero- inflated Poisson distribution is encoded by using its codename and declaring that of its parameters (‚Äòrate‚Äô and ‚ÄòprobabilityOfZero‚Äô). Model parameters Lambda and P0 are assigned to the parameter code names. To specify any given distribution unambiguously using ProbOnto, it is sufficient to declare its code name and the code names of its parameters.

It did not reach production. Design Around 1930 there was a French interest in small aircraft capable of evacuating a single ill or wounded patient to hospital from roughly prepared sites in the colonies. The Potez 42 and the Guillemin JG.40 were examples of the category and the Lorraine-Hanriot LH.21S was another. They posed several design challenges, principally around the need for a large, clear internal space for the patient, with easy ground access from a stretcher. In order to assist side access for the patient, both the Guillemin and the Lorraine-Hanriot had high-set wings, the latter's in parasol configuration. The wing was in two parts, each with a rectangular plan inner section occupying about 40% of the span and a straight- tapered outer part which ended in rounded tips. The outer regions also tapered in thickness from below, providing mild dihedral, and their trailing edges were almost entirely filled by narrow chord, unbalanced ailerons. The wing was a wholly wooden structure built around two box spars and covered with plywood. The upper fuselage was attached to the wing by pairs of N-form struts to the wing spars at about 30% span. Two lighter, transverse, inverted-V cabane struts, which shared fuselage attachment points with the main struts, supported the wing centre. In contrast to the wooden wing, the flat-sided fuselage was all-metal, with a dural tube structure. It was dural skinned apart from an easily removable section over the rear of the patient's compartment which enabled it be rapidly reconfigured to take a seated passenger. Stretcher access to this space was via a port-side door about long. Inside there were elastic supports for the stretcher, a fan and a 300 Watt heater. The pilot's open cockpit was immediately ahead of the patient's compartment and under the mid-chord of the wing, where a small, rectangular opening provided an upward field of view. He had a small, port-side door to allow a parachute escape. The Lorraine-Hanriot was powered by an uncowled five-cylinder Lorraine 5Pc radial engine. It had fixed landing gear, with each mainwheel on a cranked axle assisted by a trailing drag strut, both hinged on the central fuselage underside. Tall, inward-leaning oleo struts were mounted from the same upper fuselage point as the forward wing struts. The small tailskid also had an oleo shock absorber. Its tail surfaces were round-tipped, with the horizontal tail mounted on top of the fuselage. All of the control surfaces were unbalanced; the elevators had a small cut-out to allow movement of the rudder, which extended down to the keel. Development Lorraine- Hanriot completed the LH.21S at Villacoublay in August 1930, though the date of the first flight is not known. It was on display at the 12th Paris Salon in December 1930 and by February 1931 it was with the STIA√© for certification tests. Comparative testing by military pilots of the three air-ambulances was under way by March 1931. Test flights of the Lorraine-Hanriot continued until at least June 1931. In July 1931 Les Amis de l'aviation sanitaire (Friends of Medical Aviation) organised a large meeting on the subject spread over several days, one of which was used for demonstration flights undertaken by nine different types of aircraft. The Lorraine-Hanriot LH.21S, Potez 42, and Guillemin JG.40 formed the single patient group. None of these aircraft gained a government contract, so only two Lorraine-Hanriot LH.21S were built. The small air-ambulance role was filled by the later and more powerful Bloch MB.81.

In the 6th century, under the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, it served as an important Eastern Roman outpost in the Caucasus and, due to its strategic location, became a battleground of the 541‚Äì562 Lazic War between Rome and Sasanian Persia (Iran). Mainstream scholarly opinion identifies Petra with a ruined settlement of Late Antiquity at the village of Tsikhisdziri in Adjara, southwestern Georgia.  History  = Foundation = Petra is first referred to in the Novellae Constitutiones by the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I, dated to 535. It was built to reinforce the Roman authority in the kingdom of Lazica, located on the southeastern shores of the Black Sea and, with the emperor's approval, was named in his honor as Petra Pia Justiniana. According to the contemporary historian Procopius, Petra was founded through the efforts of the Roman official John Tzibus, who thereafter exercised tight control of imports into Lazica and controlled local access to luxury commodities and much-needed salt. The name of Petra, literally, \\"rock\\" in Greek, was a reference to the rocky and precipitous coast where the city was built. Its location between the sea and the cliffs rendered the city inaccessible, except for a narrow and rocky stretch of level ground, which was defended by a defensive wall with two towers. = Lazic War = Tzibus' monopolization of trade in Petra soured Rome's relations with the Lazi, whose king, Gubazes, secretly sought Sasanian assistance against Rome. This occasioned an invasion by a Sasanian army under Khosrow I in 541 and twenty years of war in Lazica, in the course of which Petra changed hands several times. In 541, Khosrow, following an initial unsuccessful assault on the fortifications of the city, captured Petra by sending his troops through a secretly constructed tunnel and destroying the towers, which induced the Romans to capitulate. Khosrow appropriated the riches of Tzibus, who was killed in battle, but treated the Romans of the city with consideration. In 548, Justinian sent a force under Dagisthaeus‚Äîthis time allied with the Lazi, who had become discontent with Sasanian hegemony‚Äîto retake Petra. The allies besieged the city and defeated two Sasanian field armies sent to its aid, but subsequent maneuvers by the Iranian commander Mihr-Mihroe made the besiegers' positions untenable. Eventually, Dagisthaeus failed to retake Petra in 549 and withdrew the same year. In 551, a Roman‚ÄìLazi army under Bessas began a second siege. After more than a year, the city fell and Bessas razed the city fortress to the ground to prevent it again becoming a Sasanian target. However, recent archaeological evidence from Tsikhisdziri suggests that the site survived well into the 7th century AD and beyond, with the fortification walls remaining in use and repeatedly repaired. Archaeology The ruins of a 6th-century basilica at Tsikhisdziri. Mainstream scholarly opinion identifies Petra with a ruined settlement found in the village of Tsikhisdziri, in Georgia's southwestern autonomous republic of Adjara, between Batumi and Kobuleti. It contains ruins of a citadel‚Äî200 m in length and 100 m in width‚Äîlocated on two neighboring rocky seaside hills and a large 6th-century three-nave basilica with a narthex, projecting apse, and mosaic floor, which was probably a bishop's seat. Other buildings from that time are a bath, water cistern, several other structures‚Äîremains of an urban settlement‚Äîas well as more than 300 burials located nearby. The site has also yielded several Late Bronze Age, Hellenistic, Roman, and medieval objects. Literary and archaeological evidence suggest Petra was a result of a Justinianian expansion of an earlier small Roman fort. The site is inscribed on the Cultural Heritage of Georgia list and protected as the Tsikhisdziri‚ÄìPetra Archaeological and Architectural Museum Reserve. The first to have suggested Tsikhisdziri as a location of the Roman-era city of Petra was the Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem, Dositheos II, who toured western Georgia in the 1670s. This view was shared by the leading 19th-century students of the history of Georgia, such as Marie- F√©licit√© Brosset and Dimitri Bakradze, and based on a more solid scholarly footing by Simon Janashia in 1949. There are some modern scholars who have rejected the identification of Petra with the Tsikhisdziri site, such as Simon Kaukhchishvili, a translator and critical editor of the Byzantine sources on Georgia, and Guram Grigolia.  Bishopric  The diocese, plausibly a suffragan of Phasis as listed in the Annuario Pontifio, didn't survive, but was nominally restored in 1933 as a Latin Catholic Titular bishopric under the names of Petra in Lazica (Latin), Petra di Lazica (Curiate Italian), Petren(sis) in Lazica (Latin adjective), of the Epsicopal (lowest) rank, but remains vacant as per February 2017, without having had a single incumbent.http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1391.htm  Notes   References    * Category:Populated places established in the 6th century Category:Former cities in Georgia (country) Category:Lazica Category:Buildings of Justinian I Category:History of Adjara Category:Roman‚ÄìSasanian Wars Category:Roman fortifications in Georgia (country) Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia ","title":"Petra, Lazica"},{"id":"51905809","text":"Ed Rush is the stage name used by the drum and bass producer and DJ, Ben Settle (born 1973). Rush has been releasing records since 1992 and primarily with his musical partner Optical (Matt Quinn), since 1997. Along with Optical he is also the co-founder of the record label Virus Recordings which releases his records along with other drum and bass acts. He is most associated with the aggressive styles of drum and bass music known as techstep, darkcore and neurofunk. Early career Rush's first releases were a pair of self-released white label 12\\" singles, the Prince Jammy sampling I Wanna Stay in the Jungle and Look What They've Done in late 1992. In early 1993, Rush begun playing on the London pirate radio station Don FM, where he was to first meet future production partner DJ Trace, resulting in the duo releasing the track Don Bad Man, produced by engineer Nico Sykes. Shortly after, Rush recorded the classic Bludclot Artattack which was released on Sykes' No U Turn Records. The release was a key in signalling the change from hardcore to drum and bass. Rush's work became increasingly uncompromising and dark: writing in the book Energy Flash: a Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture, Simon Reynolds wrote \\"Ed Rush's No U-Turn tracks 'Gangsta Hardstep' and 'Guncheck' took the explosive energy of hardcore and imploded it, transforming febrile hyperkinesis into molasses thick malaise\\". Further collaborations followed including The Mutant by DJ Trace in 1995 and releases on Grooverider's Prototype label and Goldie's Metalheadz further established his reputation as a drum and bass artist. In 1996 Rush and Trace named the dense, hard style of jungle they were working in as \\"Techstep\\" which went on to become the dominant style of drum and bass in the late 1990s. Rush's work with Trace and Nico on No U-Turn records was compiled on the album Torque in 1997. Collaboration with Optical In 1995 Rush met Matt Quinn, who worked under the stage name Optical. They met at the Music House, a dubplate mastering company in Islington, London where dubplates would be made for their DJ sets. Rob Playford the owner of the label Moving Shadow gave them space in his Soho office building to allow them to build their own studio. They released their debut single Funktion in 1997, and followed it up in 1998 with their debut album,Wormhole which has been described as the greatest drum and bass album of all time and introduced the style of drum and bass known as Neurofunk. In 2000, DJ Craze used their track \\"Watermelon\\" in his beat-juggling routine which helped him win his 3rd DMC World Championship. They released their second album in 2000, The Creeps (Invisible And Deadly!) which broadened their palette by introducing vocals to the mix and won best album and best producers at the Knowledge DnB awards. Their third album, The Original Doctor Shade was released in 2003 and featured a collaboration with turntablist DJs, Scratch Perverts. In 2005 they took part in the 40 Artists, 40 Days project organised by the Tate Gallery in the run up to London's successful bid to win the right to host the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. 2006 saw the release of their fourth album Chameleon which saw them using a live band for the first time and three years later followed with Travel the Galaxy. Their track Frontline was use in the soundtrack to the 2008 video game Wipeout HD. In 2014, Ministry of Sound described them as one of the most influential artists in drum and bass. Their most recent album No Cure was released in October 2015. 2015 also saw the release of their first headline mix on the long running Fabriclive series of mix CDs, FabricLive.82. They had a long relationship with the London club Fabric having played at the opening weekend in 1999 and appearing on the first drum and bass mix released by Fabric in 2002 (FabricLive.06 mixed by Grooverider). Following Islington Council's decision to revoke Fabric's licence in September 2016, Ed Rush & Optical took part in a benefit show to challenge the decision. In November 2016 agreement was made to reopen the club. As well as club appearances they have appeared at festivals including Glastonbury in 1999 and 2014 and Bestival in 2013. They have also collaborated and remixed several other artists including: Goldie, Skunk Anansie,Lil' Louis (French Kiss) and Rudimental featuring John Newman (Not Giving In). They themselves have been remixed by other artists such as Pendulum who remixed their track Bacteria in 2004. As well as his work with Optical, Rush has also released house music under the name Ben Dylan. Ed Rush is a play on the phrase \\"head rush\\", which was slang in the rave scene for a temporary whiteout caused by too many Es.

It can be used to improve tracking trends and studying data exhaust also improves the user interface and the layout design. On the other hand, they can also compromise privacy, as they offer a valuable insight into the user's habits. For example, as the world's most popular website, Google, uses this data exhaust to refine the predictive value of their products. The data that is collected by companies is often information that does not seem immediately useful. Although the information is not used by the company right away, it can be stored for future use or sold to someone else who can use the information. The data can help with quality control, performance, and revenue. Unlike primary content, these data are not purposefully created by the user, who is often unaware of their very existence. A bank for example would consider as primary data information concerning the sums and parties of a transaction, whilst secondary data might include the percentage of transactions carried out at a cash machine instead of a real bank.  Medical Exhaust Data  Most medical devices emit some form of exhaust data, such as many pacemakers, dialysis machines, and cameras used during surgery. The majority of this data is never captured, and is primarily abandoned after the surgery is completed, or the device makes its next routine check. Some issues have arisen regarding the use of the data captured by devices like pacemakers. This can lead to larger issues surrounding the use of this exhaust data. Using electronic medical records (EMR) for research poses a large number of challenges, the most prevalent being the amount of data there is.

This festival shows the religious unity of Hindu and Muslim communities. Alamipalli is located in Kasargod district near Kanhangad. The festival is a memorial to the Karbala war, an important chapter in Muslim history, as they celebrate Muharram. The same commemoration is imitated during the Alamikkali festival.Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala Site  Flame ceremony  Under the leadership of Hazrat Imam Hussain Muslims fought against autocratic ruler Yazid. In that war the enemy's army wore black clothing to scare the Hussain army. The alami dress memorializes this. At that time Hussain's army become faint and wandered for water. Yazid's army set a fire around a nearby well. These events were memorialized in Alamikkali. In the final ceremony of Alamikkali it is important to burn the flame and roll in it. This is done to show the respect towards the soldiers who lost their lives on the battlefield.Mathrubhumi News At the end of the war, Hussain was brutally killed and his body cut into pieces. At the funeral, it was very difficult to bury Hussain's hands. However they tried, it was impossible to cover the hands. At last the enemies covered half and escaped. The main item of Alamikkali, Vellikkaram, arise is in memory of this.Tourism News History The main venue of Alamikkali is at Alamippalli In Kasargod. Other than Alamipalli, celebrations are also conducted in Chithari, Kottikulam and Kasargod, where Muslims families are predominant. The main centre is Alamipally, which has no mosque. They have a rock lined floor in the shape of a flame. The Muslims of Hanefi sect, who speak Hindustani languages organise and lead the ceremony. They are known as Sahibs or Tuluker. Turks went there at the time of Tippu's campaign. They stayed around Puthiyakota (new fort, another place in Kanhangad) and inside fort. The martial arts of Turkey led them to be called sahibs out of respect. When the army occupied these forts, they gave those areas to the Turks who remained. Later the Turks struggled for their livelihood and many of them returned to Turkey. A member from one of the family was the forest guard of the governor landlord in Echikkanam. It is from this family that a series of fakir sahibs, including Rasool Sahib who organised and conducted the last Alamikkali, come from.Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala Culture The Alami role is done by those of the Hindu faith, who apply charcoal with white spots all over their bodies. They wear chains with flowers and leaves around their necks and adorn moustaches and beards with fibres of munda (a plant with thorns and leaves used for making mats). They wear dhotis on their knees and a cap of spathe on the head that contain ixora coccinea (main flower used for pooja in Kerala). In villages, alamis used to go in groups and each group contained five or six members. They move with inflated celebration by making loud sounds using bells and sticks. A wallet is carried along with a deep-bottomed vessel. Alamis never wear shoes. They visit every home asking for alms.

Dagisthaeus was possibly a descendant of the Ostrogothic chieftain Dagistheus.* In 548, Dagisthaeus, still a young officer, was magister militum per Armeniam and commanded a force of 7,000 Romans and 1,000 Tzani sent to recapture the Euxine fortress of Petra, in Lazica, from a Sassanid Persian force during the Lazic War. Dagisthaeus put Petra under siege, but, according to the contemporary historian Procopius, acted in an incompetent manner. He was so confident in victory that he wrote to Justinian, indicating what rewards he thought he and his brother deserved. Dagisthaeus failed in his task, however, and had to flee before a relieving Sassanid army towards the Phasis river, without giving orders to his men. After that, Dagisthaeus, joined by the Lazi under King Gubazes, was able to defeat two Persian field armies in Lazica, one under the command of Phabrizus on the Phasis and the other under Chorianes near the river Hippis. Nevertheless, the Lazi held Dagisthaeus responsible for his failure at Petra and denounced him before Justinian, who had him placed in detention and replaced with Bessas in 549. Around 551, Dagisthaeus was released from custody and sent to fight against the Goths to Italy under the command of Narses. He was one of the commanders of the right flank of the Roman army at the battle of Busta Gallorum against the Ostrogoths of Totila and later played a decisive role in the reconquest of Rome.

Toxicity and treatment =Toxicity= The LD50 of Ts15 is unknown. The symptoms caused solely by Ts15 have not been studied extensively. However, Ts15 is known to block the Kv1.3 channels on autoreactive effector memory T-cells. The binding of the toxin triggers immunosuppression, by decreasing the calcium influx into the cell. =Treatment= In general, a sting by Tityus serrulatus is treated with scorpion antivenom serum, named Soro antiscorpionico.

Tyge completed studies in Paris where he obtained a magister degree. Tyge became bishop of Aarhus with the support of Pope Urban IV and was involved in the ouster of Jacob Erlandsen, Archbishop of the Diocese of Lund. Bishop Tyge was known as a staunch supporter of the Danish kings and was for a period the de facto head of church in Denmark. Tyge died on Sams√∏ on 23 November 1273. His successor was the former arch deacon Peder Aaby who had been Tyge's and king Eric V'a trusted supporter during the conflict with the church.  Bishop  In 1260 there were elections in the diocese of Aarhus for bishop and Tyge received several votes although not enough to secure victory. Tyge traveled to the Pope in Rome to have the matter resolved but in the meantime the Archbishop of the Diocese of Lund Jacob Erlandsen appointed abbot Arnfast of Ryd Abbey bishop of Aarhus. Arnfast was by some suspected of having killed king Christoffer I in 1259 so it may have been a contentious decision. In Rome Tyge successfully gained the support of Pope Pope Urban IV who reprimanded Jacob Erlandsen and made Tyge bishop. In addition Tyge won the support of the pope for the candidate of the Danish state for archbishop in the Diocese of Lund. In 1262 Tyge returned to Denmark with rare relics and was quickly seen as the preeminent cleric in the diocese. Tyge had the papal nuntius magister Gerhard banish Jacob Erlandsen and Urban IV indicted Erlandsen in the papal courts with severe accusations resulting in Jacob Erlandsen and his supporters being forced to leave the country. In addition Tyge was entrusted with a number of positions. In 1263 he was tasked with designing a convent Princess Agnes was establishing, even though the convent was in Zealand. In the same year he was made responsible for collecting funds in Denmark for the crusades. In 1264 he was put in charge of the Diocese of Roskilde when bishop Peder Bang was exiled.  √òm Abbey  Pope Urban IV supported bishop Tyge in a dispute against the Cistercian √òm Abbey. One day Tyge visited the abbey but was refused entry. Tyge demanded the hospitality commonly afforded travelers but this was also refused. Tyge then forced his way into the \\"bishop's house\\" in the abbey and monks started ringing the bells in the abbey as a warning. Tyge felt threatened and fled the abbey in anger. In subsequent court meetings Bishop Tyge accused Bo, the abbot of √òm Abbey, of hiding Arnfast and other enemies of the king. Abbot Bo responded by cursing anyone who would lie in such matters. Tyge then banished Abbot Bo and all his supporters on the spot to which Bo responded by releasing himself and his supporters from the banishment. Bishop Tyge proceeded to harass peasants in the abbey and ignored Cistercian complaints to the pope. In 1267 Abbot Bo resigned his position but bishop Tyge was uncompromising towards the new abbot, Thure. Pope Urban IV eventually reproved Tyge for his acts of violence and appointed impartial judges to solve the matter. The bishops of the Diocese of Ribe and the Diocese of Schleswig in 1264 mediated a compromise that meant the abbey was obligated to host bishops as guests in exchange for Tyge relinquishing a number of other demands. Tyge subsequently abused his right and forced the abbey to host him and retinue far beyond normal. The conflict started up again, Tyge started harassing the peasants in the abbey again. When Pope Urban IV died Bishop Tyge lost a valuable ally, The cardinal Guido was made papal legate to Denmark and in 1266-67 he banished Tyge. In 1267 he was also banished by the Bishop of Schleswig for his actions against √òm Abbey and for not showing up in court. However, the banishings didn't change anything ‚Äì Tyge remained in power, √òm Abbey was economically broken and Jacob Erlandsen was still in exile.
