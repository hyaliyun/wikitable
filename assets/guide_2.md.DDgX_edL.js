Besides, on the basis of the testimony of eye witnesses he says that the ice on the Zuiderzee would not have been strong enough to carry a squadron of cavalry; de Jonge, p. 184. the French cavalry captured all 14 Dutch warships lying at anchor.Tony Jaques, Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: P-Z, p. 1009. A capture of ships by horsemen is an extremely rare feat in military history.Gregory Fremont-Barnes, The French Revolutionary Wars, p. 36. George McDonald, Frommer's Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, p. 353. The French units were the 8th Hussar Regiment and the 15th Line Infantry Regiment of the French Revolutionary Army. Jean-Charles Pichegru was the leader of the French army that invaded the Dutch Republic. The Dutch fleet was commanded by captain Hermanus Reintjes. The actual capture was accomplished by Louis Joseph Lahure. The action happened during the War of the First Coalition, which was part of the French Revolutionary Wars.  Background  Den Helder is located at the tip of the North Holland peninsula, south of the island of Texel, by an inlet to what was then the shallow Zuiderzee bay (). The Zuiderzee has been closed off and partly drained in the 20th century, and what is left of it now forms the freshwater IJsselmeer. In the fall of 1794, during the War of the First Coalition of the French Revolutionary Wars, general Jean-Charles Pichegru commanded the French forces during the conquest of the Dutch Republic. The French entered Amsterdam on the 19 January, 1795 to stay there over winter. Well informed, the general found out that a Dutch fleet was anchored at Den Helder, approximately eighty kilometers north from Amsterdam. The winter of 1794‚Äì1795 was exceptionally cold, causing the Zuiderzee to freeze.Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Histoire humaine et compar√©e du climat Tome 2: Disettes et r√©volutions 1740‚Äì1860 Pichegru ordered General of Brigade Jan Willem de Winter to lead a squadron of the 8th Hussar. De Winter had been serving with the French since 1787, and would later command the Dutch fleet in the disastrous Battle of Camperdown.  Capture  The prize of the Dutch fleet, stopped by ice in the Texel sea in the winter of 1795, by Charles Louis Mozin General de Winter arrived at Den Helder with his troops during the night of 23 January, 1795.De Jonge states that general de Winter only three days later arrived in Den Helder; p. 191. The Dutch fleet was there as expected, trapped by ice. Each hussar carried an infantryman of the 15th Line Infantry Regiment on his horse. After a careful approach to avoid awakening the Dutch sailors (the hussars had covered the horses' hooves with fabric√âditions Chronique, Chronique de la R√©volution fran√ßaise), Lieutenant-Colonel Louis Joseph Lahure launched the assault. The ice did not break, and the hussars and infantrymen were able to board the Dutch ships. The French captured the Dutch admiral and the vessels' crews; neither side suffered any casualties.  Outcome  With the capture of 14 warships, 850 guns, and several merchant ships, the French conquest of the Netherlands was brought to an end. It is one of the few times in recorded military history wherein cavalry captured a fleet; Jos√© Antonio P√°ez's cavalry attack across the Apure River in 1818 is another example. = Prizes = The ships of the line, frigates, and corvettes received French crews in February 1795. France returned all her prizes to the Batavian Republic in May 1795 under the Treaty of The Hague; one of its other provisions was an indemnity of ∆í100 million.

The incident occurred during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. It took place in a tidal trench in the channel between Texel and the mainland that was known as De Vlieter, near Wieringen. Two of the vessels that were handed to the British were Admiral de Ruyter and Gelderland.  Factual authenticity  The traditional narrative of French cavalry storming and capturing the ships at Den Helder is primarily based on French sources. Dutch historian Johannes Cornelis de Jonge states that the Dutch fleet had already received orders on 21 January to offer no resistance. Instead, de Jonge states that a few French hussars merely crossed the ice to negotiate a handover by the Dutch officers. Captain Hermanus Reintjes, the Dutch commanding officer, stayed aboard the Admiraal Piet Heyn to await the arrival of general De Winter, who was scheduled to arrive in three days. De Winter subsequently had the officers and crews of the ships pledge an oath that they would peacefully surrender ‚Äî similar to the oath administered at the surrender of the fleet at Hellevoetsluis several days earlier. De Jonge states that the misconception stems from an 1819 publication by Swiss general Antoine-Henri Jomini, whose account was subsequently cited by French historians.de Jonge, pp. 185‚Äì193.

Plot The play, a fantasy told entirely in rhyme, begins with a narrative introduction. It proceeds without further narration, but a character named Sotto voce occasionally interrupts with parenthetical footnotes for the audience. Sound effects depict a descent to Hell: a gong, followed by two crashes of thunder; then an electronic hum, first descending, then ascending in pitch; which dissolves into a sustained violin note, which finally turns into a classical cadenza. The violin is being played by the Roman emperor Nero, whose playing is interrupted by a courier summoning him to an urgent meeting called by the Devil, Mephistopheles. Mephisto explains to an assembly including Nero, Ivan the Terrible, the Biblical Haman, the Roman emperor Caligula, the Borgias, and Simon Legree, that he is concerned about the thwarting of his efforts to corrupt humanity, by the peace and good will generated by the Christmas holiday. He solicits proposals to deal with the matter. First, Caligula suggests poisoning Christmas foods and candies. Next, Nero suggests corrupting sacred Christmas music by converting it to jazz style, as has been done to classical music. Then Legree suggests bribing the US Congress to outlaw Christmas, but Mephisto points out the uncertainty of depending on corrupt politicians, who could just as easily be turned the other way. Finally, Lucrezia Borgia suggests assassinating Santa Claus, a deed she is anxious to do herself. Mephisto puts the proposals to a vote, and Borgia's plan wins. Nero is then chosen by lottery as the assassin. After a bit of fuss about how to get to Earth and to find Santa, Nero ascends to Earth with a gun in Act II and makes the arduous trek to Santa's domicile in the North Pole. Santa invites him in, well aware of Nero's sinister purpose. Santa tells Nero that the Devil cares nothing about Nero, and is only using him to acquire as large an earthly empire as possible. Nero briefly succumbs to this logic, but then takes Santa's argument as a battle of wits, and boasts of his intellectual superiority and cultural (musical) sensitivity. Santa counters Nero's boasting by expounding on the sentimental joys and wonders of Christmas, of which Nero knows nothing. This touches Nero's heart and causes him to repent of his evil purpose and ask how he can help Santa. Santa then showers Nero with hospitality, and runs to get a present for him: a Stradivarius violin. Santa also gives him a piece of sheet music, and the play closes with Nero playing The First Noel on the Stradivarius. Conception and early productions In 1938, Norman Corwin was hired by the CBS Radio Network and given his own show, Norman Corwin's Words Without Music. After the show on the week before Christmas, his producer put him on the spot by asking him what he intended to do for a Christmas show. Corwin came up with the title off the top of his head. This constrained his writing, but gave him the opening line: \\"Did you hear about the plot to overthrow Christmas?\\" The play was first broadcast on December 25. By 1940, Corwin was leading CBS's Columbia Workshop, and he again produced The Plot to Overthrow Christmas on December 22 of that year. CBS had Corwin produce and direct the play a third time on December 19, 1944, with most of the original cast, which included Will Geer as Mephistopheles. Santa Claus was played by House Jameson, and Nero was played by black stage and radio actor Eric Burroughs. Henry Morgan appeared in the 1944 broadcast as the narrator, as Ivan the Terrible, and Simon Legree.\\"The Plot to Overthrow Christmas - Norman Corwin\\", Tangent online Corwin called Burroughs \\"the finest Negro actor in radio\\" after his 1936 appearance in Orson Welles' Federal Theatre production of Macbeth. Jameson later appeared in supporting roles in the 1948 film The Naked City and in nine episodes of its television series adaptation between 1959 and 1963. In 1960, Corwin collaborated with composer Walter Scharf to turn the play into an opera, for which he provided the libretto. However, Corwin and Scharf could not agree on business terms, and the opera remained only in manuscript form. It was performed only once, in 2000 at Brigham Young University. Recreation on public television In 1969, Los Angeles public television station KCET produced a program about Corwin's play, which included an interview with Corwin about the play's origin, and a rehearsal and television reading of the play.Norman Corwin's The Plot to Overthrow Christmas, KCET.org The show was rebroadcast on PBS on December 23, 1971, as an episode of Hollywood Television Theatre. KCET rebroadcast the program in 2010 (about a year before Corwin's death) in honor of his 100th birthday, and followed it with a new interview with Corwin.

A forestry mulching machine, also referred to as a forestry mulcher, forest masticator, or brushcutter, uses a rotary drum equipped with steel chipper tools (‚Äúteeth‚Äù) or blades to shred vegetation. They are manufactured as application-specific tractors and as mulching attachments (‚Äúmulching heads‚Äù) for existing tracked and rubber-tired forestry tractors, skid steers, or excavators. Hydraulic- powered mulching attachment on rubber-tired tractor ASV RT-110 and DAF-180D clearing private property in Georgia PTO-driven forestry mulching attachment on an agricultural tractor Heavy duty forestry mulchers can clear up to fifteen acres of vegetation a day depending on terrain, density, and type of material. Forestry mulchers are often used for land clearing, right-of-way, pipeline/power line, and wildfire prevention and management, vegetation management, invasive species control, and wildlife restoration.  Applications of forestry mulching  =Right-of-way clearing and maintenance = an example of a tilting bracket Forestry mulching attachment on a Bobcat skid steer Examples of chipper tools (\\"teeth\\") available on forestry mulching attachments an example of blade and hammer selection for forestry mulching Forestry mulching is used in the right-of-way clearing and maintenance for roads, highways, pipelines, and other utility lines. This process often requires complete removal of standing trees, stumps, and vegetation. = Land clearing = Forestry mulchers can be used in commercial and residential land clearing projects such as site preparation and development, cutting and clearing brush, nature and recreational trail creation,http://www.govengr.com/ArticlesJul08/Mulchers.pdf and seismic exploration. = Wetlands and riparian habitat conservation = Forestry mulching has become popular among nonprofit riparian conservation organizations, government agencies, hunt clubs, and private land owners in attempts to maintain habitats for pheasants, doves, elk, deer and various other animals. Maintaining an animal habitat encompasses several different aspects: food, water, shelter, and space, and there are many products that can help reclaim and maintain wildlife habitats for these animals. *Food: Forestry mulchers and forestry mowers are often used for removing underbrush and invasive species, such as buckthorn and multiflora rose, in order to allow the rejuvenation of grasses and other food sources. *Water: Forestry mulchers and tree shears can be used to restore water source access that has been blocked due to tree and understory growth, allowing animals to access the water. *Shelter and space: Mulching can remove invasive underbrush that prevents the growth of the grasses required by certain animals for shelter, breeding, escaping the summer heat, and protecting themselves from cold temperatures. = Invasive species control = Some common invasive plant species such as tamarisk (salt cedar), Pinyon-juniper (pj), Russian olive, Juniperus_virginiana, buckthorn, and multiflora rose can invade a natural habitat, soak up a tremendous amount of ground water, and need to be removed to reestablish the native habitat or to preserve the water table. Invasive insects such as pine beetles can also devastate forests, leaving behind rotting trees with diminishing timber value and that may become falling hazards if they lose their ability to stand up against wind. Proactive mulching can reduce stress on trees caused by crowding, making them less susceptible to attack from invasive species. Mulching invasive species in place can control the spread of invasive plants, insects, and fungus. The mulching action tends to discharge the material downward and within a reasonably confined area, versus other methods such as rotary cutters that may laterally disperse pine beetles or other invasive species into neighboring healthy trees. = Wildfire prevention and management = *Proactive mulching: Mulching reduces the potential for wildfires by eliminating small leafy plants, fallen or rotten trees, and other fuel sources. If left untreated, these fuel loads increase potential for fire, increase the heat intensity, and serve as fire ladders that enable fire to elevate quickly to the tops of trees which is where a fire can spread most quickly. Mulching can also be used to create a coarse grind finish that can create a more ideal controlled burn. *Reactive mulching: In addition to proactive thinning of vegetation to mitigate fire fuels, forestry mulching can be used for reactive cutting of lines (fire breaks) on active fires. Larger forestry mulchers leave minimal cleanup requirements and can help reduce the overall costs of active fire mitigation. *Cleanup: After the fire is out and cleanup efforts are under way, tracked forestry mulching machines, mulching attachments, and an excavator with a mulching attachment can provide a top layer of mulch to prevent soil erosion on slopes and minimize water pollution. Advantages of forestry mulching By processing trees and other vegetation where they stand, mulching machines eliminate many of the steps involved in land clearing such as site prep, cutting/felling/hauling, and site cleanup. This also eliminates the need for multiple machines such as a bulldozer accompanied by some combination of excavators, tree shears, wood chippers or grinders, and hauling equipment. On simpler jobs only one mulching machine is required, reducing fuel requirements and emissions. Some mulching machines also have the ability to operate on steep slopes and in small or tight areas, in poor ground conditions, and in wet or snowy weather. Mulching machines are capable of clearing land of unwanted trees and brush with limited disturbance to soils or desirable vegetation. Traditional land clearing methods often present an increased risk of erosion by pushing over trees, uprooting the stump and roots, and substantially disturbing soils. In contrast, mulching the vegetation leaves the soil structure intact. The mulched material can be left on the ground and will act as an erosion barrier while returning nutrients back into the soil through decomposition. Over time, grass will naturally grow through the mulch and can be maintained with mowing. Disadvantages of forestry mulching Depending on the size and orientation of the mulching head, forestry mulchers can only fell smaller trees. Mulchers with a mulching head that rotates about a vertical axis can typically handle trees up to 6-8 inches in diameter, while mulchers with a mulching head that rotates about a horizontal axis can handle trees up to 30 inches in diameter. Some excavator mulching attachment are equipped with a tilting bracket that significantly reduce the risk of felling bigger trees with a Mulching head. Mulching trees at the upper end of this size range can be dangerous for both the equipment and the operator. Mulching areas with a variety of vegetation and terrain may require multiple pieces of equipment, including tracked mulching machines, excavator mulchers, and skid steer tractors equipped with mulching attachments. Rocks and stones cannot be processed or moved by the machines, and the teeth grinding against rocky ground can both wear them out and cause a fire hazard. Blades, hammers and teeth are replaceable and considered wear parts. Smaller rocks and other debris can be thrown through the air, and while these are usually deflected by a protective shroud, they can present a danger to the operator and surrounding people and structures. Even for the largest machines, mulching is only effective when less than 25 tons of vegetation or 100 trees are present per acre. Although mulching is significantly faster and less labor-intensive than land clearing by hand, it requires the site to have road access for fueling and maintenance.

Biography =Family origins= Traces of the Bettignies family date back to 1228. The Lordship of Bettignies was located near the city of Mons in what is now Belgium. There are further traces of the family in 1507. Peterinck de La Gohelle, de Bettignies‚Äô great-grandfather, originated in Lille. He settled in Tournai in 1752, where he founded a factory creating porcelain art on the quai des Salines. This factory was called the imperial and royal factory. In 1787 the Duke of Orleans ordered a magnificent service in blue decor from Tournai, of which some pieces are held in the Mus√©e royal de Mariemont. In 1818 Maximilen Joseph de Bettignies, advocate to the council of Tournai, General Counsel and magistrate, opened a depot at rue du Wacq in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, which he gave to his son Maximilian. On 31 July 1818 M.J. de Bettignies filed a patent No. 521 on the paste with which to make large vases of bone china (Brev. d'inv., volume XVI, p. 276). Tariffs were high, and the deposit became factory, after taken over supply of material for the porcelain maker Fauquez, which he improved. First installed in rue Marion, in 1837 the factory was established at a place called Le Moulin des Loups, on the road to Valenciennes. In 1831, Maximilian Joseph obtained French nationality. In 1833 he married, in Orchies, Adeline Armande Bocquet, who bore him four children, one of whom was Henri, Louise de Bettignies‚Äô father. In 1866 Henri de Bettignies married Julienne Mabille de Poncheville, from an old family of lawyers in the north of France. The Mabille family had its origins in the Pas- de-Calais at that time, and for several generations they were notaries in Valenciennes. On 30 June 1880 Henry and Maximilian de Bettignies ceded their business to Gustave Dubois and L√©andre Bouquiaux. =Education and family= Despite her father's financial difficulties, de Bettignies obtained a secondary education in Valenciennes with the Sisters of the Sacred Heart. According to her cousin, , According to Laure Marie Mabille de Poncheville, Her parents moved in Lille in 1895, but she left in 1898 for England to continue her higher studies with the Ursulines at Upton, Essex, and then with the Ursulines at Wimbledon and Oxford. After the death of her father in 1903 she returned to Lille, where she graduated in the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lille in 1906. After her studies she had a perfect mastery of the English language and a good knowledge of German and Italian. =Working career= She worked as a tutor in Pierrefonds, Oise, then went to Milan in Italy, to the home of Giuseppe Visconti de Modrone. In 1906, when she was with the Viscontis, she traveled extensively throughout Italy. In 1911, she went to the Count Mikiewsky, near Lemberg, in Galicia. From 1911 to 1912, she was with Prince Carl Schwarzenberg, at the Orl√≠k Castle. She then moved to the Princess Elvira of Bavaria, at the Holeschau Castle in Austro-Hungary (now Moravia, The Czech Republic). She would have met Rupprecht of Bavaria, whom she crossed in her p√©r√©gination of 1915. It was there that she was offered the position of tutor of the children of Ferdinand Joseph, heir to the Austrian throne. She declined the offer and returned to France. Back to Lille at the beginning of 1914, where she was operated on for appendicitis, she went to her brother's home at Bully-les-Mines. At the outbreak of war, Louise was quartered in a villa at Wissant rented by her brother Albert. World War I Before August was over, Louise left Wissant and returned to Saint-Omer. From there, she took the pretext of joining her sister Germaine, whose husband, Maurice Houzet was mobilized, to go to Lille. =Context in Lille= On 1 August 1914, Adolphe Messimy, Minister of War, suppressed, with the approval of Ren√© Viviani, President of the Council, the position of governor of Lille. He had exceeded his rights, as the decommissioning should have been enacted by law. Lille was then declared an \\"open city\\" (its fortifications were decommissioned in 1910) and the staff was evacuated on 24 August. On 22 August, after German patrols were seen in the vicinity of Lille, General Percin installed a 75 mm gun in front of each drawbridge of the Citadel. This initiative provoked the wrath of Charles Delesalle, the mayor, and of advocates of non-defense. Faced with this, Pervin retreated. Behind the back of the prefect, the supporters of non- defense created new initiatives to disarm the city. On August 24, the Staff evacuated Lille. During this turbulent period, the government yielded to fear. The prefect Felix Trepont was ordered to retreat with the administrative and postal services to Dunkirk. Then a few days later, he was given a counter- order. Upon his return, the prefect found the offices of military buildings open to all the winds and the equipment abandoned. On 27 August Trepont asked John Vandenbosch, an industrialist, to move all military equipment to Dunkirk. Transport lasted for 21 days, and 278 trains were needed. On 2 September, the Germans entered the city, then departed after extorting ransom. They returned several times. On 4 October, a detachment of Wahnschaffe stumbled on a battalion of Chasseurs on foot, resting in the city. Taken aback, they retreated, burning some houses in the suburb of Fives. Lille was invaded by a crowd of refugees. Until October 9, there was confusion in both prefecture and in the city. On October 9, the commander Felix de Pardieu and his territorials were ordered to retreat in the region of Neuve-Chapelle, leaving Lille without defender. General Ferdinand Foch, who arrived on the night of 4 to 5 October, warned by the prefect, sent commander Pardieu back towards Lille under the protection of the 20th Regiment of mounted chasseurs. Delayed by the crowd, the ammunition convoy was attacked by a detachment of General Georg von der Marwitz. Tired of waiting for the start of the British offensive, Foch dispatched the cavalry corps of commander Conneau to Lille. On the stroke of noon on 12 October, Lille heard the gunfire coming closer. The corps of Conneau engaged in a famous battle, but did not persist, believing that Lille had succumbed. Surrounding the city, the Germans had between 50,000 and 80,000 men, facing a motley band of 2,795 men composed of chasseurs, goumiers and especially territorials, armed with a battery of artillery, with three 75mm guns and little ammunition. =Under fire= Louise and Germaine lived together at 166 rue d'Isly. From 4 to 13 October 1914, by turning the only cannon that the Lille troops had, the defenders succeeded in deceiving the enemy and holding them for several days under an intense battle that destroyed more than 2,200 buildings and houses, particularly in the area of the station. Louise de Bettignies, aged 28, spoke four languages including German and English. Through the ruins of Lille, she ensured the supply of ammunition and food to the soldiers who were still firing on the attackers. In makeshift hospitals, she wrote letters in German dictated by dying Germans to their families. =Espionage service= Cover of the book \\"The queen of spies\\" by Major Thomas Coulson De Bettignies had been a citizen of Lille since 1903, and when the German army invaded the city in October 1914, she decided to engage in resistance and espionage. Due in part to her ability to speak French, English, German, and Italian, she ran a vast intelligence network from her home in the North of France on behalf of the British army and the MI6 intelligence service under the pseudonym Alice Dubois. This network provided important information to the British through occupied Belgium and the Netherlands. The network is estimated to have saved the lives of more than a thousand British soldiers during the 9 months of full operation from January to September 1915. The \\"Alice\\" network of a hundred people, mostly in forty kilometers of the front to the west and east of Lille, was so effective that she was nicknamed by her English superiors \\"the queen of spies\\". She smuggled men to England, provided valuable information to the Intelligence Service, and prepared for her superiors in London a grid map of the region around Lille. When the German army installed a new battery of artillery, even camouflaged, this position was bombed by the Royal Flying Corps within eight days. Another opportunity allowed her to report the date and time of passage of the imperial train carrying the Kaiser on a secret visit to the front at Lille. During the approach to Lille, two British aircraft bombed the train and emerged, but missed their target. The German command did not understand the unique situation of these forty kilometers of \\"cursed\\" front (held by the British) out of nearly seven hundred miles of front. One of her last messages announced the preparation of a massive German attack on Verdun in early 1916. The information was relayed to the French commander who refused to believe it. Arrested by the Germans on 20 October 1915 near Tournai, she was sentenced to forced labor for life on 16 March 1916 in Brussels. After being held for three years, she died on 27 September 1918 as a result of pleural abscesses poorly operated upon at St. Mary's Hospital in Cologne. Her body was repatriated on 21 February 1920. On 16 March 1920 a funeral was held in Lille in which she was posthumously awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, the Croix de guerre 1914-1918 with palm, and the British Military Medal, and she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Her body is buried in the cemetery of Saint-Amand-les-Eaux.  Tributes  Monument of Louise de Bettignies in Lille A small museum is located in the birthplace of Louise de Bettignies, rue Louise Bettignies (formerly Rue de Conde) in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, since 2008. Several French towns have given her name to streets, schools and other structures. Among others, the school where Fran√ßoise Sagan studied (and was expelled from) was named for Louise de Bettignies. De Bettignies is a secondary character in Kate Quinn's book The Alice Network, published in 2017.

John Carter (R-TX). It was reported alongside House Report 113-91. This 184-page report includes an explanatory summary, minority views from several members, and a variety of charts comparing FY 2013 funding with the proposed FY 2014 funding. On June 3, 2013, the bill was placed on the Union Calendar, calendar 64. On June 5, 2013, the House resolved itself in the Committee of the Whole to debate the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014 with Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN) as the designated chairman. The Committee of the Whole debated the bill and various amendments until 12:30am on June 6 before adjourning. On June 6, 2013, at 11:13am, the bill passed in Roll Call 211 with a vote of 245‚Äì182. =Senate= The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014 was received in the United States Senate on June 7, 2013, and then referred to the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations. =Presidential response= On June 3, 2013, President of the United States Barack Obama and his Administration released a statement on H.R. 2217. The statement explains the President's reactions to specific aspects of the funding in the bill (or removed from it). The most important statement, however, is that \\"unless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future, the President‚Äôs senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2217 and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.\\" Thus, the President has threatened to veto this bill unless certain requirements or concessions are met. The President also threatened to veto the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014 on the same day. Despite this threat, the House passed the bill three days later. Debate and discussion Media coverage. Organizations and people for or against.

Normal cyclovergence and cycloversion  Conjugate cyclorotations of the eye (that is, cyclorotations in the same direction) are called cycloversion. They mainly occur due to Listing's law, which, under normal circumstances, constrains the cyclorotation in dependence on the vertical and horizontal movements of the eye.  Visually evoked cyclovergence  Listing's law, however, does not account for all cyclorotations. In particular, in the presence of cyclodisparity (that is, when two images are presented which would need to be rotated in relation to each other in order to allow visual fusion to take place), the eyes perform cyclovergence, rotating around their gaze directions in opposite directions, as a motor response to cyclodisparity. Such additional, visually evoked cyclovergence appears to superimpose linearly onto the cycloversion due to Listing's law. Visually induced cyclovergence of up to 8 degrees has been observed in normal subjects. Together with the 8 degrees that can usually be compensated by sensory means, this means that the normal human observer can achieve binocular image fusion in presence of cyclodisparity (also called orientation disparity in the case of a line image) of up to approximately 16 degrees. Larger cyclodisparity normally results in double vision. It has been shown that the tolerance of human stereopsis to cyclodisparity of lines (orientation disparity) is greater for vertical lines than for horizontal lines. The visually evoked cyclovergence relaxes once the cyclodisparity is reduced to zero. The effect also relaxes when the eyes are presented with darkness; however, experiments show that in the latter case the cyclovergence does not disappear completely straight away. Cyclovergence can also be evoked by cyclodisparity of the visual field; the cyclodisparity can be introduced by dove prisms. Here, use is made of the fact that a pair of dove prisms rotate an image optically if they are arranged one after the other and with an angular displacement relative to each other. Conversely, the range of cyclovergence-based cyclofusion can be trained using dove prisms that actively rotate the field of view: \\"The patient fixates a vertical line target, and the dove prism is rotated in the direction to increase the action of the insufficient muscle while fusion is maintained.\\" The cyclorotation of the eyes can normally not be performed under voluntary control; nonetheless it is possible to do so after extended practice. Voluntary cyclorotation after extended practice was first demonstrated in 1978.Training of voluntary torsion, Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. April 1978 vol. 17 no. 4 303‚Äì314 (full text)  Measurement  It has long been known that the human visual system compensates for cyclical mismatch in such a way that cyclofusion and thereby stereo vision is achieved. There has been agreement on this point since the question was raisedNagel, 1891, cited after: in 1891. However, for a long time the mechanism of the compensation was unclear: many thought that cyclofusion was due exclusively to high-level processing of the visual images, while others suggested a motor cyclovergence response. In 1975, motor cyclovergence was demonstrated for the first time with photographic methods.; also as cited in: Cyclovergence, and more generally torsional eye positions, can be measured using scleral coils or using video-oculography. Torsional eye positions can also be measured using fundus cyclometry, which is based on infrared scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. There have been contradictory statements on whether cyclovergence can be measured subjectively, that is, by an evaluation of the subjects' own statements on whether lines in a scene appear at an angle in the two eyes. Recent evidence based on an analysis of the empirical horopter suggests that subjective estimates of cyclovergence are accurate if they are performed using horizontal lines to the left and to the right of the fixation, not vertical lines above and below it which would be affected by shear of retinal correspondence points.

List of communities There are four recognized communities in the Newe Midbar Regional Council: *Abu Talul, *Abu Qrenat (Abu Quraynat), *Qasr al-Sir, *Bir Hadaj. These communities are populated by almost 10,000 people (as of 2013), Bir Hadaj the largest of them.Formation of new towns for the Negev Bedouin MMI. p.5 There is also a number of \\"diaspora\\" Bedouin living in unrecognized villages and thus not eligible to municipal services, whose number is unknown. History =Legal background= Prior to the establishment of Israel, the Negev Bedouins were a semi-nomadic pastoralist society that had been through a process of sedentariness since the Ottoman rule of the region. During the British Mandate period, the administration did not provide a legal frame to justify and preserve lands‚Äô ownership. In order to settle this issue, Israel‚Äôs land policy was adapted to a large extent from the Ottoman land regulations of 1858 as the only preceding legal frame. Thus Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands using the state‚Äôs land regulations from 1969 and designated most of it for military and national security purposes. =Sedentarization= The 1948 UN Partition Plan, which was accepted by the Jewish leaders, envisaged most of the Negev (including most of the ancestral Negev Bedouin territory) as part of a planned Arab state, with the Jewish State of Israel situated to the north in areas with an existing Jewish majority. However, after the rejection of the UN plan by the united Arab nations, their subsequent declaration of war on Israel, and their eventual defeat in the 1948 Palestine war, the Negev became part of Israel and the Negev Bedouin became Israeli citizens. The new Israeli government continued the policy of sedentarization of Negev Bedouins imposed by the Ottoman authorities in the early 20th century, mirroring developments in nearby Arab nations. Early stages of this process included regulation of previously open lands used for grazing and re-location of Bedouin tribes. In the decades after the war of independence, the Israeli government was concerned about the allegiance of the Negev Bedouin to the new State, and thus re-located two- thirds of the southern Bedouin population into a closed area under the authority of the IDF. This situation was maintained until the late 1970s. Starting in the 1980s the civilian government took back control of the northern Negev Bedouin from the IDF and began to establish purpose-built townships specifically for Bedouins in order to sedentarize and urbanize them, and to allow for the provision of government services. The government promoted these towns as offering better living conditions, proper infrastructure and access to public services in health, education, and sanitation. The new development towns constructed by the state in the 1980s absorbed a large proportion of the Negev Bedouin population but were unable to handle the entire Bedouin population, and their later reputation for crime and poor economy, together with a cultural preference for rural life, caused many Israeli Bedouin to shun these towns in favour of rural villages unapproved by the State. Today, the government estimates that about 60% of Bedouin citizens of Israel live in permanently planned towns, while the rest live in unrecognised villages spread throughout the Negev.Bedouin information, ILA, 2007 These villages are considered illegal under Israeli law, and their legal status, coupled with their periodic demolition and evacuation by police, is the subject of considerable debate. =Formation of the Abu Basma regional council= In 2003, the government decided to establish a new regional council, known as the Abu Basma Regional Council, in order to oversee the resettlement and development of Bedouin communities in the area around Be'er Sheva, Dimona, and Arad.Beduin in Limbo The Jerusalem Post, 24 December 2007 This was coupled by the formal recognition of a number of existing Bedouin villages within the council in order to encourage Bedouin to move from other unrecognised / illegal villages elsewhere in the Negev.Government resolutions passed in recent years regarding the Arab population of Israel Abraham Fund Initiative The council was established by the Interior Ministry on 28 January 2004.The Bedouin Population in Transition: Site Visit to Abu Basma Regional Council Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute, 28 June 2005 At the time, the regional council had a population of approximately 30,000 Bedouins and a total land area of 34,000 dunams, making it the most populous regional council in the Southern District but the smallest in jurisdiction.Spatial Inequality in the Allocation of Municipal Resources Adalah, December 2004 There was considerable controversy within the Bedouin community regarding the establishment of this council. The Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages (RCUV) argued that while the creation of the Abu Basma Regional Council would set a precedent for the transformation of unrecognized villages into urban ghettos by limiting their boundaries to the area of habitation and zoning most Bedouin grazing grounds; this type of de jure recognition has not entailed the introduction of business districts or de facto recognition through equitable provision of education, health, transportation and municipal waste services long denied to, and demanded, by the Bedouin community.RCUV Requests Comment to the Goldberg Commission regarding Bedouin Settlement in the NegevJonathan Cook.Making the land without a people ; Al-Ahram Weekly, 26 Aug-1 Sep 2004 See also *Abu Basma Regional Council *Arab localities in Israel *Negev Bedouin References External links *An official site of Abu Basma Regional Council in Hebrew and Arabic *Bedouin of the Negev *Lands of the Negev, a short film presented by Israel Land Administration describing the challenges faced in providing land management and infrastructure to the Bedouins in Israel's southern Negev region Category:Regional councils in Israel Category:Bedouin localities in Israel Category:2012 establishments in Israel ","title":"Neve Midbar Regional Council"},{"id":"39794905","text":"James L.

The game contains no dialogues and uses black silhouette graphics similar to Limbo. Hero of Many is inspired by the games Another World, Heart of Darkness and Abe's Oddysee. Gameplay A screenshot from the game. Player controls the ball as he is accompanied by white fishes. Black fishes are enemies. You can see the black silhouette graphics resembling Limbo. Player takes role of a white-colored ball-shaped creature. The creature went to an underwater cave in which he can meet fishes. There are two groups of them. White ones are friends to the player and accompany him as he get near them. Black ones are enemies and attacks him and his companions. The player can send white fishes that follow him against the black ones. The glowing of player's character serves as the health indicator. It can be replenished by lights that can be found scattered across the level. There are also crystals that serve as checkpoints. The game contains 26 levels. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level. There are 4 worlds ‚Äì Grey, Red, Green and Blue. There are also multiple puzzles, mini games and boss fights. There are also present multiple traps that player should avoid. Story The game contains no spoken dialogues but there are numerous cutscenes displaying events from game's world. The game takes place during a period of genocide on white fishes committed by the black ones. Hero narrowly escapes death when his escort is attacked by black fishes. He starts to organize defense and eventually kills a captain of black fishes but it turns out that he was just a minion and black fishes are truly led by the Black. Hero continues to fight enemies and gets to the Kingdom of Red where he meets Red Queen. They continue together but they soon come across Black who easily defeats Hero who is unconscious falling to the depth while Red Queen is trying to help him but Hero is eaten by a Whale. Hero gets out of Whale's stomach and gets to the Green World. There he meets Green. They start to seek for green seeds that can revive the Tree of Life which is the center of Green World but is currently rotten. During the search Hero is attacked by the Earth Dragon and almost dies but is saved by Red Queen who shows up at the last moment. They together revive the Tree of Life but Black shows up and attacks it along with his army. Hero fights them off but Green dies. Energy from his body enters the Tree where it grows into a fruit. Via this fruit Hero gets Green's power. Hero starts his chase for Black. It leads him to the Blue World. In the Blue World he liberates a temple from black fishes and meets Blue who puts him into the test. Hero has to get through a labyrinth and fight a labyrinth monster. He passes and Blue explains the start of the war. Black fishes were once white but they came across to black mass. It turned them to black and made them aggressive. It also turned Grey to Black. He then initiated the campaign to exterminate white fishes. Hero returns to the Kingdom of Red where he meets Red Queen. They are attacked by Black and forced to overcome a \\"race\\" with him. In the end they escape. Together they get to the center of the kingdom where Red Queen gains new power so they launch attack which pushes black fishes from a local nest. There they help little fishes to born. Soon after that Black attacks and conquers it back. Hero has to escape but is able to gather enough forces to start attack against enemy positions in Grey World. It turns bad when he comes to contact with black mass while saving life of Red Queen for whom he sacrifices himself. He finds himself in a black-and-white world where meets Green and is \\"reborn\\". Hero becomes stronger than ever and starts to gather strong swarm for final battle. Just before the attack he meets Red Queen for the last time. The strike is successful, as he destroys black armies and Black is chased to the lighthouse. There a duel between Hero and Black occurs. In the end Black is defeated and absorbed. Hero, now exhausted from the darkness he absorbed, leaves the lighthouse and lies himself to the ground. Player can see a text of words by Lao Tzu: \\"Bearing yet not possessing. Acting yet not expecting. Leading yet not dominating. This is the Primal Virtue.\\" Hero then dissolves the darkness he absorbed and dies. Multiple lights of energy are coming from his body and Red Queen takes them. She puts these lights across the world while credits roll.

Its formation process is identical to that of a normal rainbow (namely the reflection/refraction of light in water droplets), the difference being that a monochrome rainbow requires the sun to be close to the horizon; i.e., near sunrise or sunset. The low angle of the sun results in a longer distance for its light to travel through the atmosphere, causing shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue, green and yellow, to be scattered and leaving primarily red. In the lower light environment where the phenomenon most often forms, a monochrome rainbow can leave a highly dramatic effect.

The school, founded in 2000, offers a classroom learning experience that is new even to some adult workers, for whom education was a luxury back home. In the 12 years it has been open, more than 12,000 Myanmar workers have studied and graduated from the school. History When the school first began operations, classes were conducted in front of Ramkamhaeng University's student club building, where they stayed for several months. The workers organised the classes themselves although it proved quite a hurdle to draw people at first. Refugees and activists also joined the classes eventually. The Thai-Burma Coordinating Committee later decided the school should move to the Christian Students Centre in Bangkok and Myint Wai took the helm of the school. Founder / headmaster Headmaster Myint Wai, 57, a former student who fled the military crackdown in 1988, has been a source of hope and offers help to fellow Myanmar citizens in need, including migrant workers. He currently resides in Bangkok. He attributed the success of the school to the wide range of assistance it gets including from organisations and political groups inside Myanmar which have supported and monitored the work of the school. He has said, in reference to the school, that it is negotiating with both ministries to be recognised as a vocational training institute in Thailand. Myint is also the deputy director of the TACDB.

His family moved to Los Angeles when he was seven, then moved to the Coachella Valley in 1903. During World War I. Dilworth served in the American Expeditionary Forces in France. He later became a farmer in Hemet, California. He served as a mail carrier, postmaster, and Assistant Clerk of the state Assembly.Letter from Nelson S. Dilworth to Citizens of Hemet, San Jacinto and vicinity (Aug. 20, 1936) http://www.onevoter.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/1936_Letter_Campaign.pdf Dilworth was elected to the state assembly in 1936, where he served until his election to the state senate in 1944. Dilworth was a member of the Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities under state Senator Jack Tunney. A staunch anti- communist, Dilworth sponsored legislation to prevent communists from employment in the state government. He also introduced legislation that removed the US Communist Party from the ballot in California. Dilworth authored the Fourth Report of the Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, 1948: Communist Front Organizations. Dilworth also served as chairman of the Senate Investigating Committee on Education. This committee produced several reports relating to alleged communists in education in California, including its Third Report in 1952, which identified that Kenneth MacGowan, employed by the University of California Berkeley, \\"has been affiliated with ... Communist front organizations\\" including the Motion Picture Artist's Committee and the Hollywood Democratic Party. The 1953 Dilworth Act specified that \\"no person knowingly a member of the Communist Party shall be employed or retained in employment by a school district\\" and that all school district employees have a duty to answer, under oath, questions about their membership in the Communist Party. Refusing to answer such questions constituted grounds for dismissal. One teacher dismissed for refusing to answer questions about her husband's associations was Jean Benson Wilkinson, a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Her husband, Frank Wilkinson, was an officer of the Los Angeles City Housing Authority. Jean Wilkinson was dismissed as a teacher after refusing to answer questions before a California State Burns Committee hearing which was investigating her husband. Dilworth is quoted as saying, > \\"It is often true that many things which, in the end, bring benefits and > satisfaction are very difficult to get started in the beginning. So it is > going to be hard to save America from those who are pushing us and taxing us > downhill into a form of state socialism. And there is no time to lose.\\" and > \\"Citizens must have labor preference over aliens.\\" Dilworth retired from the legislature in 1960 at age 70. He died in 1965. The Nelson S Dilworth Elementary School in San Jose, California, is named after him, although he had no apparent connection to San Jose. The school opened in 1965, the year that Dilworth died.

Services or people that implement content curation are called curators. Curation services can be used by businesses as well as end users. Concept Museums and galleries have curators to select and interpret items for collection and display. There are also curators in the world of media, for instance DJs of radio stations tasked with selecting songs to be played over the air. Methods Content curation can be carried out either manually or automatically or by combination of them. In the first case, it's done by specially designated curators. In the second case, it's done using one or more of the following: * Collaborative filtering * Semantic analysis * Social rating = Collaborative filtering = Collaborative filtering is a method of forecasting often used in recommendation systems. This principle is based on the axiom that evaluations made by users in the past are predictive of evaluations that they will make in the future. Collaborative filtering can either be based on votes and views of a given social community, as it's done on Reddit and Digg, or the end user's own prior activity, as it's done on YouTube and Amazon. = Semantic analysis = Semantic analysis examines the relationship between the various elements and sources of information found in a given document. The system compares some of the factors or all the information sources topics and terms. This method uses the principles of factor analysis to analyze relationships between the studied phenomena and objects. This approach has been successfully implemented by services like Stumbleupon, which break up content according to topic, subtopic, and category. Trapit uses semantic analysis in combination with user feedback and AI technology to refine content selections for its users. = Social rating = This method employs user ratings and recommendations to select content. The system finds someone with interests similar to the end user and bases its recommendations on their activity. This method of selection is widely used on social sites such as Facebook and Flipboard. Parameters for determining the social ranking are generally based on actions such as shares, votes, likes, etc., keeping in mind the time that these activities are carried out once the content is published. The more there are such activities in a shorter time, the higher rating this content gets. \\"Social curation\\" services like Pinterest allow users to share and discuss their curated collections of found content.

Family and childhood  Bourdon was born in Normandy, France on August 5, 1860. His village was composed of five or six educated men such as the priest, doctors and notaries. Bourdon spent his childhood and part of his adolescence in the class of farmers, sailors and quarry workers. Bourdon‚Äôs father was a farmer and his mother was from humble origins, daughter of a farmer and described by Bourdon (1932) as being unassuming, superior in mental ability but lacking the ambition and favourable conditions to reach a higher social level. At the age of twelve, he entered the boarding school Lyc√©e de Coutances, graduating with the bachelier es letter es sciences at nineteen. After hesitating between a teaching career and a career in law, he decided to study law in Paris but lost interest in the subject after a year, turning to the preparation for a teaching career in philosophy at the Sorbonne. Among t his teachers were Elme-Marie Caro (1826‚Äì1887), Ludovic Carrau (1842‚Äì1889), and Paul Janet (1823‚Äì1899), the most eminent French representatives of philosophy at the time. Nevertheless, Bourdon gave little credit to the teaching of philosophy for his intellectual development, but ascribed his biggest influences came from reading Berkeley, Hume, the Mills, Bain, Spencer, James and Theodule Ribot (1839‚Äì1916), the latter was also Bourdon\`s teacher. In 1886, after having obtained the highest level of teaching diploma available in France, Bourdon received a scholarship to go to Germany for a year where he got the opportunity to learn from Wundt in Leipzig in his laboratory of experimental psychology. This experience gave Bourdon the ambition to bring France up to date with the progress and development of the study of psychology.  Experimental psychology laboratory  In 1887, Bourdon returned to France and in the following year, he became professor at Rennes University. In 1891 he took charge of his first philosophy class where he integrated the first provincial university experimental psychology course where he tackled questions on perception, attention and consciousness. At the time in France, \\"experimental\\" was related to experiments on hypnotism because the universities were focused on scientific psychology studies based on pathologies and psychics. Bourdon felt as though the centralization in France interfered with educational progress. All universities needed to prepare the students for an exam held in Paris, where the educational programs were created and imposed throughout the country. Bourdon felt as though philosophy students were insufficiently prepared in matters of science. In 1892, Bourdon received his doctorate degree with a French thesis entitled L‚Äôexpression des √©motions et des Tendances dans le Language and a Latin thesis related to qualities of perception in Descartes. In early 1896, Bourdon founded the first university laboratory of experimental psychology and linguistics in the University of Rennes. Bourdon explains in his autobiography that during the war, the laboratory served as a hospital where he re-educated speech to the wounded men who suffered from aphasia. Bourdon\`s laboratory was vandalised and looted during the second World War (Beuchet, 1961). Nevertheless, his laboratory was restored in 1946 by his successor Albert Burloud and it still stands today.  Research  Bourdon\`s work was more focused on the areas of ideas, memory, and perception. He was very fond of manual training and built many experimental apparatuses himself. His findings were published in 74 papers. La Perception Visuelle de l‚ÄôEspace published in 1902, is said to be his most important work in which he discusses spatial perception and conducts new experiments such as studies on motion parallax. His contribution to psychometrics was the test of attention and concentration that bears his names and is used today with modification (i.e. Bourdon‚ÄìVos test and Bourdon‚ÄìWiersma test).

It produced no performance or operational advantages over existing types and only one was built. Design and development The D.IV was a single bay triplane with equally spaced, staggered wings; only the lowest had dihedral. The central plane was mounted at mid-fuselage and the others passed above and below the fuselage, supported by centre section struts. The wings were two spar structures and decreased in chord from top to bottom, so the interplane struts were not parallel but leant longitudinally apart. In plan the fabric covered wings were almost rectangular, apart from angled tips; their span decreased a little from top to bottom but all carried externally interconnected, short span ailerons. There was a small circular cut-out in the trailing edge of the upper wing above the cockpit to enhance the pilot's view. The fuselage of the D.IV, like those of their earlier fighter designs, was a wooden monocoque but LFG abandoned their earlier Wickelrumpfe (wrapped fuselage) approach, which used thin bands of spruce veneer reinforced with fabric, in favour of a cheaper Klinkerrumpf (clinker fuselage) which followed boat building practice with overlapping spruce strips over a light wooden internal framework. It was oval in cross-section, though the six cylinder, water-cooled upright inline Mercedes D.III was mounted with its cylinders and exhaust exposed above it, driving a two blade propeller with a large spinner. The fuselage tapered behind the open cockpit, where an unswept straight edged, blunt angle tipped tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, carried separate, tapered elevators. The vertical tail was rounded, with a rudder that extended below the tailplane to the keel. The conventional undercarriage had mainwheels on a single axle, supported by long V-struts to the lower fuselage, together with a short tailskid. The single prototype ordered by Idflieg was tested during the Summer of 1917 but was badly damaged at the end of September. LFG rebuilt it using a similar Klinkerrumf intended for a D.VI biplane fighter and testing was soon resumed. It was decided that the Dr.I, as it was now known, showed no particular advantages over existing German fighters and development was abandoned.

Early life He was born on 23 April 1786, in Titchfield Street, Marylebone, London; his father was a surgeon, who died when he was six years old. He sailed, under age, on board the sloop to Toulon, and was present at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in 1797. After escaping drowning off Cuxhaven, where Raven was lost and the crew had to take refuge in the rigging, he reached England. He sailed again on board , carrying Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, to the blockade of Brest. The Peace of Amiens of 1802 deprived Cooke of his naval occupation. Actor and manager In January 1804, Cooke made his stage d√©but at the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square. He was then engaged by Astley for Astley's Amphitheatre where he appeared as Lord Nelson. He subsequently played at the Lyceum, and then joined the company of Henry Erskine Johnston, who opened a theatre in Peter Street, Dublin. In 1809 he was engaged by Robert William Elliston as stage manager of the Surrey Theatre, where he remained a favourite. Thomas Potter Cooke in a nautical part On 19 October 1816, Cooke appeared at Drury Lane as Diego Monez, an officer, in a melodrama, attributed to Robert Bell,Catalogue of the John Larpent Plays. and called Watchword, or the Quito Gate. He then played some new characters, mainly foreigners, such as Monsieur Pas in the farce Each for Himself, Almorad, a Moor, in Manuel by Charles Maturin, and Hans Ketzler in George Soane's Castle Spectre. Career peak On 9 August 1820, Cooke had major success at the Lyceum as Lord Ruthven, the hero of The Vampyre, and in the following year strengthened his reputation as Dirk Hatteraick in the Witch of Derncleugh, a version of Guy Mannering, George in The Miller's Maid (a melodrama of John Faucit Saville from Robert Bloomfield), and Frankenstein's monster in Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein, Richard Brinsley Peake's 1823 adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. Cooke then joined the Covent Garden Company, and played Zenocles in Ali Pacha, by John Howard Payne, on 19 October 1822, Richard I in Maid Marian on 3 December 1822, and other parts. When, in 1825, Frederick Henry Yates and Daniel Terry took the Adelphi, Cooke was engaged and played Long Tom Coffin in Edward Fitzball's drama The Pilot. At the close of the season he visited Paris, and presented Le Monstre et le Magicien (again playing Frankenstein's monster) 80 successive nights at the Porte-Saint- Martin. In 1827 he was in Edinburgh, where he was frequently seen by Christopher North, who called him \\"the best sailor out of all sight and hearing that ever trod the stage\\". In 1828‚Äì9, Cooke was again at the Adelphi. His most conspicuous success was at the Surrey, on 8 June 1829, as William in Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan. The Evening Standard 9 June 1829 p. 1. After playing it over 100 nights there, he was engaged to appear in the play at Covent Garden, where he remained until 1834, when Alfred Bunn, who managed both theatres, transferred him to Drury Lane. Two years later he returned to Covent Garden, to act under Osbaldistone. Last years Thomas Potter Cooke, 1843 lithograph In October 1857, Cooke played as a star at the Standard. For the Jerrold Remembrance Night (29 July 1857) he appeared at the Adelphi as William. His last appearance was at Covent Garden, for the benefit of the Royal Dramatic College, on 29 October 1860, when he once more played William in a selection from Black-Eyed Susan. Cooke died on 10 April 1864, at 37 Thurloe Square, the house of his son-in-law. After the death of his wife, a few months before his own, he had given up his own houses in Woburn Square and at Ryde. He was buried in Brompton cemetery. By his will Cooke left ¬£2,000 to the Royal Dramatic College, the interest of which was to be paid for a prize nautical drama.

Due to an agricultural crisis, demonstrations took place in numerous towns and cities in early 1928, and deputations were sent to Berlin to voice grievances against trade and tax policies. Farmers' continuing financial difficulties and dissatisfaction with their own lobby organizations led to more radical protests, especially in the province of Schleswig- Holstein, from late 1928. Passive resistance included tax strikes and the obstruction of foreclosures, but some farmers, with the assistance of nationalist radicals, resorted to terrorist methods. Throughout 1929 bombs were placed in public buildings, including the Reichstag. The Rural People's Movement ran its own newspaper \\"Das Landvolk\\" which was edited by Bruno von Salomon, the brother of Ernst von Salomon. With the arrest of the bombers and many of its leaders, as well as the rise of the Nazi Party, the Landvolk declined from 1930. Hans Fallada's first successful novel, A Small Circus (Bauern, Bonzen und Bomben), was based on the farmers' protests, especially a demonstration and boycott of the town of Neum√ºnster.

It was modeled on and often served alongside of the better known Gorham's Rangers.Carroll, \\"Savages in the Service,\\" pp. 409-413, 419-425 The unit was recruited in early 1756, during the early stages of the Seven Years' War / French and Indian War, from among men serving in two then-disbanding New England provincial battalions stationed in Nova Scotia.Charles Lawrence to Lord Loudoun, Halifax, n.d. [ca. Nov. 6, 1756], Loudoun Papers--North America, Huntington Library, San Marino, Calif. Raised to help protect the British garrison on the Isthmus of Chignecto and secure the area after the siege of Fort Beaus√©jour, their principle foes were Acadians resisting removal from the region and Mi'kmaq Indians resisting British authority. Their primary area of operations was the northwestern portion of Nova Scotia and the north and eastern parts of what would later become New Brunswick. The unit averaged a little over one hundred men for much of its existence, although it seems to have been augmented to 125 for the attack on Havana in 1762.Two muster rolls exist for the company, one from 1758 and the other from 1761, housed at the American Antiquarian Society. The breakdown of the company is also contained in numerous returns in the Loudoun and Abercromby Papers (Huntington Library) and in the Amherst Papers (War Office, British Archives)--they show that at full strength the unit had from 100 to 110 men, although due to casualties and illness its numbers ebbed to just 58 at one point. The company often operated in tandem with Gorham's Rangers, based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and after 1761, the two companies were combined into a Nova Scotia ranging corps, led by Major Joseph Gorham.  Composition & Activities  Danks Rangers 1757 Recruitment Advertisement. Boston News-Letter 18 Nov. 1757 In addition to Yankees from New England, the unit contained Scots and Irish immigrants as well, and a half-dozen Native Americans from New England. The company performed reconnaissance duties and frontier guerrilla warfare. They not only played an important role in the Acadian Removals (1755-1760), but they took part in a number of important campaigns during the war, particularly the landing at Louisburg in 1758, and the Siege of Quebec in 1759. The unit suffered heavy casualties as a result of repeated skirmishing with Canadian militia and allied Indians around the edges of the Quebec siege and, for a time, after Danks was seriously wounded, the unit was absorbed into the ranger company of Captain Moses Hazen. As part of the combined Nova Scotia ranger corps, Danks and his company took part in the Siege of Havana in 1762, where, according to Israel Putnam, Danks sold his commission in the rangers at Havana on 23 Sept. 1762 to Andrew Watson, who commanded the company for the next few months until the unit was disbanded after half its men had succumbed to tropical diseases. The survivors were drafted into British infantry regiments at Havana whose ranks were equally depleted by illness.  Scalping Controversy  The unit was loathed by the Mi'kmaq who lived near Fort Cumberland, the units' main base of operation, and they also suffered from a poor reputation among the early British settlers to the region‚Äîapparently because of their reputation for cruelty and for their scalping of enemy combatants and non-combatants alike, regardless of ethnicity. The following account of Danks and his company comes from the notes compiled by Arthur G. Doughty, the editor of the journals of John Knox, an Irish officer in the regulars who was stationed at Fort Cumberland in 1759 and often assigned to accompany Danks' unit on missions: Doughty says of Danks, \\"He appears to have been one of the most daring officers in the service, and particularly energetic in attacking the Indians,\\" but goes on to say that the company \\"were not over scrupulous in the matter of taking scalps.\\" He makes this claim as there is evidence that while they were given (so-called) permission by British authorities to scalp Indians, they were accused of scalping Acadians and Canadians as well. His source for this accusation is a letter written in 1791 by an early Nova Scotia settler, the Rev. Hugh Graham.Letter by Rev GrahamWhile Indians scalped colonists in raids and after battles, they were encouraged to do so by first the British (starting in 1675) and then later by the French colonial government (after 1692). Both eventually fully condoned the practice and encouraged their Indian allies to scalp enemy opponents by paying bounties in cash or trade goods for the grisly trophies. An interesting and important side effect, British Colonial troops adopted the practice but apparently French troops did not, or if they did it was done only rarely. English laws in Massachusetts and other colonies only officially allowed scalping against Native Americans whom they were at war with. However, it is clear these policies openly encouraged genocide, as they paid for the scalps of not just warriors killed in battle but also Native non-combatants. They had a graduated system of bounties that paid the most for a warrior's scalp, less for a woman's and still less for the scalps of Indian children. However Graham's lack of outrage when Indians were scalped by Europeans, yet outrage over Europeans scalping other Europeans smacks of a double standard evident in these statutes and in the attitudes of colonists in general. See James Axtell, \\"The Unkindest Cut, or Who Invented Scalping,\\" and \\"Scalping the Ethnohistory of a Moral Question,\\" The European and the Indian, pp. 16-37, 207-243 and Jean-Fran√ßois Lozier, \\"Lever des chevelures en Nouvelle-France: la politique fran√ßaise du paiement des scalps,\\" Revue d'histoire de l'Am√©rique fran√ßaise, vol. 56, n¬∞ 4, 2003, p. 513-542. In it, Graham has the following to say about the activities of Danks' company during the dark days of the Expulsion of the Acadians: :\\"A Party of the Rangers, a Regiment chiefly employed in scouring the Country of the deluded French who had unfortunately fallen under the Bann of British Policy, came upon 4 French Men, who had with all possible Caution ventur'd out from their Skulking Retreats to pick up some of their straggling Cattle or hidden Treasure. The solitary few, the pitiable four had just sat down, weary & faint, on the Bank [of] a Stream in order to refresh themselves with some Food and Rest, when this Party of the Rangers surprizd & apprehended them. And as there was a Bounty on Indian Scalps (a Blot on Britain's Escutcheon) the Soldiers soon made the supplicating Signal, the Officers turn'd their Backs and the French were instantly shot and scalp'd. A Similar Instance happened about the same time. A Party of the Rangers brought in one day 25 Scalps pretending that they were Indian. And the Commanding Officer at the Fort then Col. Wilmot, afterwards Governor Wilmot (a poor Tool), gave Orders that the Bounty should be paid them. Capt. Houston who had at that time the Charge of the Military Chest objected [to] such Proceedings both in the Letter & Spirit of them. The Col. told him 'That According to Law the French were all out of the French, that the Bounty on Indian scalps was according to Law, and that tho' the Law might in some Instances be strain'd a little yet there was a Necessity for winking at such things.' Upon which Huston in Obedience to Orders paid down, telling them that the Curse of God should ever attend such guilty Deeds.\\"Nova Scotia Papers, Canadian Archives, M. 651 A. (Brown Collection in British Museum, Add. MSS. 19071). Doughty further observed that \\"these Rangers almost without Exception clos'd their days in Wretchedness and particularly a Captain Danks, who ever rode to the Extreme of his Commission in every barbarous Proceeding. In the Cumberland Insurrection [during the American Revolution] he was suspected to be \\"Jack on both Sides of the Bush\\" left Cumberland (that place) in a small Jigger bound for Windsor, was taken ill on the Passage, thrown into the hold among the ballast was taken out at Windsor half dead, and had little better than the burial of a Dog. He liv'd under a general Dislike & died without one to regret his Death.\\" Nova Scotia Papers, Canadian Archives, M. 651 A. (Brown Collection in British Museum, Add. MSS. 19071). While there is a chance Graham's moralizing account is embellished or merely tall tales told of a more barbaric time, as it was written more than thirty years after the events it discusses by a religious figure, a recent article by historian Brian D. Carroll suggests the Mi'kmaq targeted rangers from Danks' company specifically for violent retribution. And Carroll further quotes Knox himself recording regular British troops having to defend an Acadian woman from members of the company during the Petitcodiac River Campaign in 1758.Carroll, \\"Savages in the Service of Empire,\\" pp. 409-413, 419-425.  Company's Personnel  The sources for the names of the company's personnel below are two muster rolls, one (incomplete) from 1758, and another (complete) from 1761. Both are in the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester Massachusetts (the French and Indian War and Massachusetts Collections, respectively). Another source was a list of sick rangers and deserters from the company in the same collections. = Officers = 1758 *Captain Benoni Danks *Captain-Lieutenant Thomas ArmstrongPossibly a Pennsylvanian of Irish descent, born 1734. There was a lieutenant Armstrong in the 2nd Battalion (commanded by George Scott) of the Shirley's provincial forces sent to Nova Scotia in 1755-56. This is probably him. [Died in Quebec, 1759] *Lieutenant John WalkerWas a provincial officer and later sergeant in the Shirley's provincial battalions. After the Siege of Fort Beausejour in 1755, he helped raise the company of rangers from among the New England men in the regiment (that became Danks' company). He was at the siege of Quebec in 1759. In his 1761 assessment of the officers in his ranging corps, Major Joseph Gorham hoped that Walker could be exchanged for \\"a more active fit Officer for the Ranging service\\" as he had become \\"too corpulent.\\" See \\"Establishment of Two Companies of Rangers in Nova Scotia,\\" 6 April 1761, Amherst Papers, W.O. 34-12, 74, 86.

Amherst Papers, W.O. 34-12, 74, 86. British Archives *Lieutenant Stephen HollandIn a 1762 petition, Holland noted he joined the company in 1756. While Gorham declared him well-suited for ranging, Holland resigned his commission just prior to the Havana campaign in the summer of 1762 for several reasons: a serious leg injury he received in 1760, which never healed properly. He declared this rendered him unfit for the service. As a result, he spent from 1760 to 1762 on recruiting duty in New England. He also mentioned that he had suffered numerous financial setbacks because of his lengthy service during the war. Amherst Papers, W.O. 34-12, 86. *2nd Lieutenant Marquis de Compte de Gravena [a.k.a. \\"Peter De Compt\\"]An approximately fifty-year-old Sicilian nobleman and mercenary adventurer. He came to Nova Scotia with Cornwallis in 1750 and appears to have been in the pay of the company since 1759, but had never actually served in the unit before Havana. Gorham described him as lazy and unmotivated and declared him grossly \\"unfit for the service.\\" Amherst Papers, W.O. 34-12, 86. *2nd Lieutenant Samuel ShiptonWas a gentleman volunteer in the 40th Regiment and had served at Louisburg and Quebec, before being appointed ensign in the 55th British Regiment of Foot. About aged 18 in 1761, he resigned his commission in the 55th in order to obtain a lieutenancy in the rangers. He cited the recent death of his father and financial circumstances as his motivation for doing so. Amherst Papers, W.O. 34-12, 86.

Members  * Atabai Charykuliev - vocals * Gasan Mamedov - violin, Honored Artist of Turkmenistan. * Sabir Rizaev - clarinet, soprano saxophone * Kurban Kurbanov - accordion * Hakberdiev Alamuradov - dep, hammer, varnish  History  The musicians of the band individually built their careers by playing at weddings, at one of which lead singer Atabai Charykuliev was noticed by orientalist and producer Nazim Nadirov. Surviving a state campaign against Islamic wedding music (at one point, Charykuliev was confined to a mental institution for continuing to play), the dissolution of the Soviet Union enabled him to continue performing. After several concert performances (including a performance on Turkmen television together with singer Aziza), he was awarded the title \\"Honorable Traditional Musician of the People\\" by the newly independent Republic of Turkmenistan. Ashkhabad was soon formed as a Muslim wedding music supergroup, naming itself after the capital of Turkmenistan. After one of the band's shows was recorded at a studio in Germany and given a tour in Europe, Charykuliev said that he owed all that he has to the President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov. On March 21, 2009, Charykuliev died in Ashgabat.  Recordings and notable performances  In 1993, they were the first musical group from the former Soviet Union to be published under the label of Peter Gabriel - Real World (division of Virgin Records). Their album, City of Love (a literal translation of the band's name), found some popularity in Europe. In 1998, together with the Greek singer Melina Kana, they released the album Loot. On 23 February 2000, they appeared on the television show Anthropology‚Äò‚Äò on channel NTV Russia and in 2002 on Channel One Russia's Nochnaya smena. In 2002, the band performed concerts in Moscow and attended the First Moscow International Festival of Ethnic Music.

Tokelau comprises the three Pacific atolls of Atafu, Nukunonu, and Fakaofo. The constitutional history of the atoll group dates to its earliest human settlement of at least 1,000 years, much of this time involved an unwritten and oral tradition. It has been governed by many written acts and rules of governance since 1887. The history of Tokelau's laws has been recorded in Tokelau Subdelegated Legislation 1877‚Äì1948 and is also published by the Tokelau Law Project. Western Pacific High Commission establishment (1877‚Äì1889) Tokelau was a British protectorate between 1877 and 1889 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories. The earliest control of Tokelau was under British sovereignty in 1877 by the Western Pacific Order in Council 1877 as part of the British protection. However this order was specifically related to the British jurisdiction in respect of British subjects in the islands of the Western Pacific that were not colonial territories. The locale was called the Union Islands during this period. British Protectorate and Colony (1889‚Äì1926) In June 1889, Tokelau got the status of a British Protectorate and was formally brought under the protection of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. The Union Jack flag was hoisted on each of the three islands. Under His Majesty's dominions according to earliest gazetted Order of His Majesty in Council dated 29 February 1916, the three islands in the Pacific Ocean were brought under the Council, which were then known as the Union Islands or just Tokelau. The order also authorised encroachments of the boundaries of the colony of Gilbert and Ellice Islands to subsume Tokelau Island. By the Order of October 1925 and Tokelau was made an independent dominion and the Governor-General of New Zealand was charged with its administration. Under subsequent amendments to the Act of 1925, Western Samoa was given charge of Tokelau Islands. It was also stipulated that the islands should become part of New Zealand for which the necessary legislation was ordered to be passed by the Parliament of New Zealand by a specific date. It remained a colony of the United Kingdom through 1926. Constitutional documents of interest during this period include: * Native Laws of the Union Group (1912) * Order in Council Annexing the Union Islands to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (1916) * Native Laws Ordinance (1917) * Union Islands (No 1 and No 2) Order in Council (1925) * Notice of Proclamation of the Union Islands (No 1) Order in Council (1926) New Zealand Administration (1926‚Äì1993) After it was made a dependency as a New Zealand territory, it was administered by the departments of the New Zealand government (1926‚Äì1993). The Tokelau Act of 1948 was an act passing sovereignty of the Pacific territory of Tokelau to New Zealand. It was issued on 29 October 1948 and was amended on 9 December 1976 under section 2(1) of the Tokelau Amendment Act of 1976. The principal acts of the Tokelau Islands were further amended initially by Tokelau Islands Amendment Act 1967 and subsequently Tokelau Islands Amendment Act 1970 under which the words Island were dropped from the wordings and the name of the islands was changed to \\"Tokelau\\" only. Further amendment was made under Tokelau Islands Amendment Act 1974 in which more clarifications on deletion of words \\"Tokelau Islands\\" were affected, while the Tokelau Act 1976 was related to the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zone. Further Amendment Acts were established in 1982, 1986 and 1996. Documents of interest during this period include: * Union Islands Transfer of Control to New Zealand (1926) * Union Islands (No 1 of New Zealand) Order (1926) * Union Islands (Revocation) Order in Council (1948) * Tokelau Act 1948 Self-government within New Zealand (1994‚Äì) Flag of Tokelau In subsequent subsection amendments of the Tokelau Amendment Act 1999, issued in July 2001 the directive was specific to the Tokelau (Employer for Tokelau Public Service) Order 2001. Under this amendment the powers of the New Zealand State Services Commissioner was transferred to the Tokelau Employment Commission to administer the Tokelau Public Service. Since 1994, it has vast self-governing powers, but not the status of an independent country. Two referendums have opposed any change in its present status. Tokelu remains a territory of New Zealand as two referendums held for self-government failed to muster enough support even though the United Nations had urged them to become independent. This vote was in-spite of an assurance that they would retain their New Zealand citizenship and $11 million a year grant would not be withdrawn. Documents of interest during this period include the Tokelau Amendment Act 1996 (Preamble) and the Joint Statement of the Principles of Partnership (2003). Unofficial local flag The amended acts authorised the specific issue of coins of \\"Tokelau 2000 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Commemorative Five Dollars\\" and gold coins of the \\"Tokelau 1999 Smallest Gold Coins Commemorative Ten Dollars\\". The former coin is embossed with picture of His late Majesty King George VI and Her late Majesty the Queen Mother standing to the right acknowledging the greetings of the people assemble below the balcony.

Visual art career Chamberlain's work includes large-scale drawings of early modernist interiors made in ink on a material known as \\"vintage tracing cloth\\" that was developed around 1910 to be used as an architectural drafting paper. She started in ballpoint pen‚Äîblue or black Bic, diluted‚Äîapplying it by brush. In 2009, she started to depict 1930s domestic, office, and factory interiors in watered down lithographic ink on a large scale. The next year she began casting lead crystal panels to accompany the drawings, and in 2011 started to incorporate soundtracks to her exhibitions with musical collaborator Kenn Richards and presented her first solo exhibition in New York City at DODGEgallery. The work, at its base, is a contemplation of the difference between modernism's ideals and its physical actuality and the idea of the live-and-workspace as an extension of the self, capitalizing on the delusion of the interwar period of early modernism. An art reviewer for Time Out magazine characterized it as having a \\"beautifully elegiac air\\" whereas a reviewer for the New York Times described the same work as \\"ooz[ing] loneliness.\\" Artforum's Nuit Banai notes the work's \\"double dynamic\\" of disavowal and confirmation while Art in America's Aimee Walleston sees the work as posing questions, \\"The art is an unadulterated exaltation of Modernism‚Äîyet its absence of figures induces viewers to wonder: did fantastic things really happen here? Or are the interiors Chamberlain investigates sites for a magnificent moment that could never really be?\\" In 2015 Chamberlain wrote about the 17th century Shoin rooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the Brooklyn Rail. She wrote \\"I am interested in the fact that this room is both old and new, that we look at it through a reconstruction, that is, through another's gaze.... Hovering between the two-dimensional and three- dimensional, my reconstructions distill the desire that is latent in these spaces, a desire to control and improve human behavior, to make us saner, healthier, or just more beautiful. When I stand in front of this reconstruction at the Met, I feel the distillation happening here as well.\\" Her work was included in Trent Morse's 2016 book Ballpoint Art (Laurence King Publishing), which also included the work of Cy Twombly, Alberto Giacometti, and Dawn Clements. Her drawings are also on offer on pillows via artmultiple.com. Music career =1998 to 2002= Having studied opera for a couple of years under Gina Crusco, Chamberlain joined her New York City Underworld Productions Opera remaining a member until 2006. In 1992, she began singing and writing music with artist and composer David Abir whom she met at a summer program in Philadelphia when they were both in high school: Their band's name was (SIGH). She next became lyricist and lead singer for the band Research with Kenn Richards: They recorded the album The Post Modern Always Rings Twice with producer Dave Fridman of the Flaming Lips on Elektra Records which was never released. Other members included Suzanne Thorpe and Sean Thomas Mackowiak of the band Mercury Rev, and they released an EP called (Almost) Nothing Yet on Stickshift in 1998. Chamberlain also sang with a light-and-sound performance art group called The Infant Reader, also with David Abir. =Maxi Geil! and PlayColt, 2002 to present= She began working with Maxi Geil! & PlayColt in 2002, after being recruited by her now-husband Guy Richards Smit who heard from mutual friends she was looking for a new music project. The lead singer's name translating to \\"super horny\\" in German, Maxi Geil! & PlayColt is a band centered around a fictional New Wave pop star played by Smit based on '70s and '80s Dutch rock star Herman Brood. Its music is a variety of pop that blends influences from Brian Ferry, Roxy Music, and David Bowie from his Ziggy Stardust era. In addition to Smit on lead vocals, the band includes Chamberlain, also on vocals, John Allen on lead guitar, and Mark Ephraim on rhythm guitar as well as a rotating cast of others including now-TV actress Zoe Lister-Jones, as well as Smit's Dutch half-brother Tijn Smit. With songs like \\"I Will Leave You First\\" and \\"Making Love in the Sunshine,\\" the group's music has been described as \\"anti-sentimental.\\" In \\"Making Love in the Sunshine,\\" for example, the band \\"request[s] your presence in the bathroom / When the music stops,\\" and in \\"The Artist's Lament,\\" Maxi croons \\"I want your vagina around the head of my prick.\\" The band has played a number of times in New York City and London, and released two albums, A Message to mMy Audience, their first full-length effort in 2004, and Strange Sensation in 2007. Performative and other work =Nausea 2= Chamberlain starred with Smit in the most ambitious in the Maxi Geil! video series, an hour-long rock musical that debuted at MoMA during its fall 2004 reopening. They played porn stars Giselle Thurst and Maxi Geil! who have reached crossroads in their careers. (A second plot involves a young amateur porn star, Annie Ball, played by Zoe Lister-Jones.) The cast also includes a bevy of other Brooklynites, including Christian Viveros-Faun√©, art critic and Smit's then-gallerist as a member of the Spanish press, and film actor Leo Fitzpatrick as a porn actor. When Maxi and Giselle finally meet, after the former dramatically resigns from his career, they set out to find themselves. In the end, however, they only end up shopping, Smit's attack on the notions of self-exploration in the work of his contemporaries. The work features, among others, the song \\"The Love I Lose,\\" the first part sung by Giselle after she is fired from one job and runs errands in Culver City, the second by Maxi in his dressing room before his resignation press conference. A writer for The Washington Post describes Nausea 2 as \\"appealingly complex.\\" He continues, \\"It's as though Smit takes the premise of a mockumentary such as This Is Spinal Tap, then gives it the density and even subtle conherence of good contemporary art.\\" Art critic John Haber wrote that he found the work \\"hilarious,\\" declaring it both \\"less pretentious\\" and \\"more coherent\\" than a Matthew Barney epic cycle. Maxi Geil! & PlayColt also played at the MoMA reopening event. =Fashion design consulting= Having received her apparel training at RISD, Chamberlain currently works as a fashion design consultant. In the '90s she worked for Gap and Old Navy. Her clients include Coach, Gary Graham, Uniqlo, Gap, and sweaters for Rebecca Taylor and Lou & Grey. She is friends with Marcia Patmos of Lutz & Patmos and M. Patmos, for whom she has also designed.

Description  The Shivneri Buddhist caves are located near Shivneri Fort on the top of the hill, where Shivaji Maharaja was born. It is a group of 60 caves that were excavated in the first part of the 1st century CE. At the beginning of the 2nd century CE, these caves were a flourishing center of Buddhist activities. The caves are essentially made of viharas or small cells, but there are also chaityas. The caves are scattered on three sides of the west-east-south triangle formed by Shivneri Mountain.Buddhist Cave Temples Of India, by RS Mauchope, 1933 The caves are scattered around the hill, and categorized into several groups: the East group (1, 2 and 3), the West group, and the South group.

The April Crisis, which occurred in Russia in April 1917, broke out in response to a series of political and public controversies. Conflict over Russia's foreign policy goals tested the Dual Power arrangement between the Petrograd Soviet and the Russian Provisional Government. The Executive Committee and the full Soviet endorsed N.N. Sukhanov's \\"An Appeal to All the Peoples of the World,\\" which renounced war and \\"acquisitionist ambitions.\\" This appeal conflicted with the Provisional Government's position on annexations, and Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov responded with the Milyukov note on 18 April, declaring Russia's right to Constantinople and the Dardanelles. Newspapers printed Milyukov's note on 20 April. Milyukov's note united disparate groups of Russians against the Provisional Government, and against Russian involvement in World War I. The public responded with mass demonstrations and violence in the streets of Petrograd, forcing Milyukov and War Minister Alexander Guchkov to resign. These events blurred the distinction between Dual Power, resulted in more governmental Soviet positions, and isolated the Bolsheviks as the only major Socialist party not affiliated with the Provisional Government.  Background  After the end of Romanov rule in February 1917, Russia's new Provisional Government, composed of State Duma members and the Petrograd Soviet of Workers‚Äô and Soldiers‚Äô Deputies, governed Russia as halves of the Dual Power dynamic. Soviet participation in the Provisional Government swayed governmental policies, and cultivated the political issues of the April Crisis. At the time, Russia was embroiled in World War I, but was suffering catastrophic losses to German armies. = February Revolution = On 23 February, working class women stormed the streets of Petrograd, indicating the beginning of the February Revolution. This day was the socialist holiday International Women's Day, and women gathered to protest food shortages and high bread prices. In the following days, the protests intensified as both men and women marched towards the center of Petrograd. Russian police, known as the Cossacks, and soldiers from the Volhynian regiment, attempted to disseminate the crowd, but had little success. Four days later, on 27 February, key Russian military units allied themselves with the protestors, arresting Tsarist ministers the following day. During this span of time, Tsar Nicholas II had taken personal command of the Russian army. Upon receiving news about the unrest in Petrograd, the Tsar made the decision to return to the capital and restore order. However, the Tsar's generals and a delegation of politicians from the State Duma, persuaded him that only by abdicating the throne could he achieve social peace. = Dual Power Legitimizes Soviets = The Provisional Government and the Soviet of Workers' Deputies had conflicting plans for governance, and this disparity underlies much of the polarization and conflict of the April Crisis. Created from former representatives of the State Duma, the Provisional Government took power on 2 March. The Provisional Government questioned their own authority and was hesitant to exercise power. This created a void of decisive governance, and damaged the Provisional Government's standing among Russia's lower classes. But the Provisional Government was always somewhat distanced from workers, soldiers, and peasants. The Petrograd Soviet, on the other hand, possessed powerful street-level sway of worker and peasant opinions. This asset made cooperation with the Soviets imperative to the Provisional Government's success, as ignoring the Soviets meant relative isolation from large segments of the population, and greater unrest among lower classes. By cooperating with the Petrograd Soviet, the Provisional Government offered the Soviets a foundation from which the could draw power, and (to a certain extent) vindicated Soviet beliefs. It also gave them a powerful platform to voice their discontent with the Provisional Government's policies.  Events  = Appeal to All the Peoples of the World = On 1 March the Petrograd Soviet released \\"An Appeal to All the Peoples of the World,\\" a letter written by N.N. Sukhanov. The letter condemned Russia's participation in World War 1, criticizing the country's enduring expansionist ambitions. It also sought to confine Russia's focus mostly to intra-national issues. The letter was released at a time of public turmoil and disenfranchisement with the Provisional Government. Russia's lower classes had seen no relief from the burdens of inflation and limited resources, and were becoming more inclined to the Soviet ideals. = Declaration of War Aims = The Petrograd Soviet pressured the Provisional Government to speak against the aims of the old, tsarist regime in the war. On 14 March, the Provisional Government declared that Russia's goal was not to conquer people or territories, but was to achieve stable peace. = April Theses = On 3 April, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin arrived in Petrograd on a sealed train from Switzerland. At the Finland Station, he made statements against both the \\"Appeal to All the Peoples of the World\\" and the \\"Declaration of War Aims,\\" instead demanding \\"all power to the soviets.\\" He rejected any cooperation with the Provisional government or the Mensheviks, and called for withdrawal of Russia's troops from the war. Lenin's views on these issues were published in the Bolshevik newspaper, Pravda, on 7 April in what is known as his April Theses. = Milyukov Note = On 18 April, the foreign minister, Paul Milyukov, sent a note to the Allies that said that Russia was determined to fight until World War I ended in victory. The note explained that the Provisional Government would readily enforce the usual \\"guarantees and sanctions\\" that would accompany victory. This statement implied that Russia would retain control of the Dardanelle Straits and Constantinople, as previously agreed upon by the Allies in 1915. = Mass Demonstrations = In response to Milyukov's leaked notes, vast numbers of workers and soldiers took to the streets of Petrograd and Moscow. These demonstrations were sometimes violent: armed soldiers occupied the streets, and many skirmishes occurred between pro and anti-government activists. Brutality among anti-government protestors was aimed at the Provisional Government's inconsistent stance on Russia's participation in the war. Facing famine and inflation, protestors raised their voices to decry the Provisional Government's failure to represent their viewpoints and desires. Among protestors demands was the faint call for Soviet power, which displayed the evolving sentiments of Russia's populace, and foreshadowed the lower class-driven rise of the Soviets. Fearing that Russia was not ready for Soviet rule, Soviet leaders worked to pacify protestors and quell demonstrations.  Aftermath  = Reshuffling of Government = Responding to unrest among Russia's lower classes, Milyukov and the War Minister, Alexandr Guchkov, both resigned. The cabinet was subsequently reorganized to include Soviets. Victor Chernov, a leader of the Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs) was now Minister of Agriculture, and Irakli Tsereteli, a Menshevik, was in charge of Posts and Telegraphs. The far-left leaning Bolsheviks refused to participate in what they viewed as the \\"bourgeois\\" coalition government. This left Lenin and the Bolsheviks as the only group that held fast to their anti-war policy, due to the collaboration and compromise needed for the other left-leaning political groups to work with the coalition government. = Increase in Bolshevik Popularity = The Bolsheviks were the only political party that remained unwavering in their stance against Russia's involvement in the war. Lenin believed that the \\"international, imperialist war,\\" would be better turned into a series of revolutionary wars within the warring nations. The Bolshevik Party's strict stance against Russia's participation in World War 1 led to an increase in the party's popularity.

Life and career Freeman was taught ukulele by his father when aged seven and learned guitar from the age of eight. He began working on multi-tracking from the age of 16. Freeman attended Geelong Grammar School in 1966, starting at Timbertop and was in C Unit. Hes formed the \\"Dementers\\" a three member guitar vocal group with Dale Hollands and Jonathan Gibson. The trio sang occasionally in the Timbertop chapel. Prince Charles attended Timbertop in this year and heard the trio. He owned a placid blue Fender electric guitar at this time and displayed a solid rhythm in performing songs like the Trogg's hit \\"Wild Thing\\". He was a capable student, joining to the higher maths classes, and possessed a sharp (sometimes wicked) sense of humour. He was popular with fellow students and teachers. Despite his asthma, he was a determined cross country runner participating in the Marathon school run and compulsory long distance weekend hiking events. In 1970 he attended Taylor's Coaching College in Melbourne and during lunch time he and friends would go to Allen's Music to play guitars and sing current Beatle songs. He liked John Lennon's songs such as \\"Across the Universe\\". He was never shy when it came to performing music. He drove a white Volkswagen \\"V\\" dub and lived in Melbourne's eastern suburbs and started performing at the Green Man coffee shop. In 1967, when aged 17, Freeman's left hand middle fingertip was severed in a car accident. He had it replaced with a silver one crafted in a playing position. Nicknamed \\"Silver Finger\\", he learned to work around the injury using his left hand \\"only to press down on the strings\\". At the age of 21 he travelled to Spain and was taught by flamenco guitar virtuoso Manitas de Plata. He released three solo albums, Thesilger (1976), Shifting Sands... Night & Day (1978) and Best of Chris Freeman (1991). He also issued four albums with keyboardist John Shaw, Chris Freeman and John Shaw (1981), Synthesized Orchestration (1983), Synthesized Orchestration Vol. 2 (1984) and The Best of Chris Freeman and John Shaw (1990). In 1976 he self-financed his debut album, Thesilger, (named for the replacement finger) on T. S. F. Records. Mike Daly of The Age felt that Freeman \\"experimented with quaint effects involving digital harmoniser and distorted vocals ‚Äì with mixed results\\". Two years later Freeman followed with Shifting Sands... Night & Day. When performing solo, he used a backing tape with orchestral tracks previously recorded on a Fairlight CMI. In May 1981, Freeman combined with keyboardist and orchestral arranger John Shaw to issue an album, Chris Freeman and John Shaw, independently on Chris Freeman Records and distributed by EMI Records. Aside from his own work he also covered Gymnopedie by Satie and Recuerdos de la Alhambra by T√°rrega. Daly described this album as \\"a very different proposition\\" compared to Freeman's debut: here the \\"melodies are dominated by [his] lyrical adaptation of the rich flamenco style\\". The Sydney Morning Heralds Susan Molloy found it was \\"of precious quality and outstanding beauty\\" displaying a variety of styles \\"from classical to flamenco to rock and roll, from disco to calypso-reggae and soft country rock\\". As well as recording and performing Freeman also taught flamenco and classical guitar techniques. In early 1982 he toured with the Peter Stuyvesant International Music Festival. He issued two further albums with Shaw, Synthesized Orchestration (1983) and Synthesized Orchestration Vol. 2 (1984). In 1990 Freeman and Shaw compiled their collaborations on CD, The Best of Chris Freeman and John Shaw. The following year he released a solo compilation album, Best of Chris Freeman. Freeman died in 1992, aged 41 or 42, after an asthma attack. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described him as a \\"[g]ifted multi-instrumentalist\\" who \\"garnered considerable praise for his work, but he never embraced the notion of mainstream acceptance\\".

He was out of a Never Say Die mare named Double Zero. Play The Red is best remembered for placing second in the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $200,000 Grade I Preakness Stakes, to Elocutionist.Play The Red's pedigree and partial racing stats  Racing career  Bred and raced by Max Gluck's Elmendorf Farm, at age two Play The Red won his maiden in his third attempt and also won an allowance race at Aqueduct Racetrack. Then he stepped up in class and finished second in Aqueduct's Grade II Remsen Stakes to Kinsman Hope at a mile and one eighth on dirt. In his three-year-old season, he finished second in the Grade II Omaha Gold Cup. Next he finished third in the Grade II American Derby at a mile and three sixteenths on the turf at Arlington Park to Bemo. Then Play the Red ran third in the Grade II Gotham Stakes at a mile and one sixteenth to Zen at Aqueduct Racetrack. In May 1976, he finished near the back of the field in the $250,000 Grade I Kentucky Derby. That race was won by champion Bold Forbes with another champion, Honest Pleasure, coming in second. Preakness Stakes Two weeks after the Derby, trainer John P. Campo ran Play the Red in the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes, run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Play the Red was listed as the longest shot on the board at 26-1 on the morning line in a field of six colts. The prohibitive favorites were Honest Pleasure at 4-5 and Kentucky Derby winner Bold Forbes at 6-5. Play the Red broke last of six and was unhurried under jockey Jean Cruguet. Going into Pimlico's famous \\"Clubhouse Turn,\\" he tucked in toward the rail and moved up into fifth. The fractions were blistering on the front end, with the first quarter in :223/5 and the half in :45 seconds flat. Down the backstretch, Play the Red drifted out and brushed Honest Pleasure while moving into fourth, a half length behind Cojak. Going into the final turn, Cruguet urged Play the Red to the inside, and he started picking off horses, including Bold Forbes. He finished second, three lengths behind winner Elocutionist. Bold Forbes finished a half length behind Play the Red in third, with Cojak three more lengths back in fourth. The exacta of 4 and 2 paid $347.40.

After winning one of her two starts in 1979, she won the Musidora Stakes on her three-year- old debut before winning the Oaks in record time. Later that summer she broke loose during a training session and sustained career-ending injuries. She was retired to stud with a record of three wins in four races and has had some influence as a broodmare. Background Bireme was a chestnut mare with a white blaze bred by her owner Richard Dunbavin \\"Dick\\" Hollingsworth at his Arches Hall Stud in Hertfordshire. She was one of the first crop of foals sired by Grundy, an outstanding racehorse who won The Derby and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1975. Grundy went on to sire several other good winners, but his stock tended to be slow-maturing stayers and he was sold and exported to Japan in 1983. Bireme's dam Ripeck was a highly successful broodmare whose other offspring included the Queen Alexandra Stakes winner Balinger and the Coronation Cup winner Buoy. Ripeck was a granddaughter of the Hollingsworth family's influential broodmare Felucca, whose other descendants included Cut Above (St Leger Stakes), Sharp Edge (Irish 2,000 Guineas), Longboat (Ascot Gold Cup), Bolas (Irish Oaks), Dash for Cash (Australian Guineas) and Daffodil (AJC Oaks). The filly was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire, and was ridden by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson. Racing career =1979: two-year-old season= Bireme did run as a two-year-old, when she won a thirty-runner maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October. She was then matched against colts in the Houghton Stakes over the same course and distance later that month and finished third behind Night Alert and Posse. The first and second both developed into top class milers in 1980: Night Alert won the Prix Jean Prat while Posse won the St James's Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. =1980: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Bireme was moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Musidora Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse in May. Ridden by Carson, she started at odds of 4/1 and won from the Lingfield Oaks Trial winner Gift Wrapped and the 1000 Guineas runner-up Our Home. On 7 June, Bireme was again moved up in distance to contest the 202nd running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. She started at odds of 9/2 in a field of eleven fillies which included the 1000 Guineas winner Quick As Lightning who was made 3/1 favourite. Willie Carson had the choice of three Hern-trained runners and selected Bireme ahead of the partially sighted May Hill Stakes winner The Dancer and the Cheshire Oaks winner Shoot a Line. Carson settled Bireme in second place behind The Dancer, before moving into the lead two furlongs from the finish and winning by two lengths from Vielle, with The Dancer in third and Quick as Lightning fourth. The win gave Hern and Carson a classic double, having won the Derby with Henbit three days earlier. After the race Carson said: \\"She gave me a super ride. I was never in any doubt with her, she is a lovely filly with a long stride who just keeps finding it for me.\\" Her winning time of 2:34.33 broke the race record which had stood since 1927. Dick Hern intended to aim the filly at the St Leger Stakes in September, but her training was disrupted by tendon trouble. While still recuperating, and undergoing gentle exercise on the Berkshire Downs, she sustained a career-ending injury. Recalling the incident, Hern explained that after throwing her rider, Bireme \\"took off with her tail in the air and went for home as hard as she could leg it, right across the West Ilsley-East Ilsley road before she crashed in the lane. She cut and bruised herself so badly that she never ran again.\\" Her stablemate Shoot a Line went on to be unbeaten after her Oaks defeat winning the Ribblesdale Stakes, Irish Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks and Park Hill Stakes. Assessment and honours In 1980, Bireme was given a rating of 127 by the independent Timeform organisation, four pounds below the top-rated three-year-old filly Detroit, the winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Bireme an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Dick Hern called her \\"a very, very good filly who never reached her potential because of injury ... nobody knows quite how good she could have been.\\" Stud record Bireme was retired from racing to become a broodmare at her owners stud. She produced at least six winners, the best of whom was the filly Yawl, who won at Listed and Group Three level. Yawl's daughter Prowess produced the 2013 Oaks winner Talent. Bireme's winning progeny included: *Trireme (chestnut colt foaled in 1987, sired by Rainbow Quest), won two races *Quadrireme (bay colt 1989, sired by Rousillon), won four races *Yawl (brown filly 1990, sired by Rainbow Quest), won Oh So Sharp Stakes and Rockfel Stakes *Admiral Rous (bay colt 1991, sired by Rousillon), won one race *Yacht (chestnut colt 1990, sired by Warning), won two races *Flagship (GB) : chesnut filly, foaled 18 February 1994, by Rainbow Quest (USA), won one race and placed once from 5 starts in England 1996‚Äì97 Bireme was euthanised at Arches Hall on 10 January 2002 because of \\"the infirmities of old age\\". She was twenty-five years old.

She was formerly known as Lilith Love but she changed her artist name in 2020. Recurring themes in her work are: identity, femininity, female archetypes, gender bending, freedom and equality. Early life Henri√´tte is the youngest in a family of four. Her father was a clog maker and mailman. Since her childhood she has been writing, drawing and cooking. She attended the Schoevers Academy in Nijmegen and worked as an executive secretary from 1983 till 2000. Writer to photographer In 2005 Henri√´tte resumed writing. Her culinary erotic story Kalfsbraadstuk op tagliatelle met een zachte saus van witte port en kaas (Veal roast on tagliatelle with a smooth sauce of white port and cheese) was published in: Raadselige Roos 2005, a collection of stories that had entered the competition for prose and poetry of the Literary Cafe for the Venray-region. To illustrate the blogs that she posted online, she started to make self-portraits to go with the stories. At first she used a webcam, then she switched to a simple compact camera. In 2006 the self- portraits almost completely replaced the stories and from that moment on she tells her life story with photos, using a single-lens reflex camera, tripod and remote control. 2009: Let the fork do the talking Controversy Henri√´tte's work has caused controversy on several occasions. She has also been censored during an exhibition in the Euregio-Haus in M√∂nchengladbach, Germany and during an exhibition in the convention center (and former seminary) Rolduc in Kerkrade, The Netherlands.

In the same year her work was also shown in the USA for the first time. During Photoville in Brooklyn Bridge Park, New York City her work could be seen at two exhibitions: The Wonder of Woman and FotoFestival Naarden. Photo documentary In 2012 she started her project A house is not a home, in which the houses of complete strangers are the setting for her self-portraits. That same year she also started the photo documentary Risja, a story by Lilith - This is bugging me, about Risja Steeghs a girl who lives in her village and who suffers from a severe form of Lyme disease.

Biography Holland was born in Wimbledon, London and was educated at Westminster School before moving to the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied with Frederick Corder. He later studied with Joseph Joachim at the Musikhochschule in Berlin. Holland initially pursued a career in the theatre, but he won two mentions in dispatches and an OBE for his services during the Great War. The war, however, left him shell-shocked, a condition with which he suffered for the rest of his life. In 1927 Holland was appointed Professor of Harmony and Counterpoint at the Royal Academy of Music, a position he would hold until he died. His professional duties included those of Treasurer of the Royal Musical Association and as a member on the committees of the Royal Philharmonic Society and the Incorporated Society of Musicians. His students included Iris du Pr√©, mother of cellist Jacqueline du Pr√©. Lessons were held in the music room at the top of his London home in Eldon Road, Kensington, also the scene of regular concerts and musical gatherings. Holland's wife Ism√©na became godmother to the young cellist.Jacqueline du Pr√© Her Life, Her Music, Her Legend by Elizabeth Wilson, 1997 Much younger than her husband, Ism√©na survived him by nearly 60 years. She died in October 2004, aged 101.The Times, 4 November 2004, page 82. Work His early theatre compositions included incidental music for Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona, additional songs for Leo Fall's operetta The Merry Farmer (1907) and the children's opera King Goldemar (1902). But Holland composed in almost all major classical forms. For orchestra he wrote Gavotte Pastorale, the tone poem Evening on the Lake (1908), a violin concerto in one movement, Ellingham Marshes for viola and orchestra, the Spring Sinfonietta (1943) and the Threnody for cello and orchestra (1945), which was not performed until three years after the composer's death, at a concert in Watford.Radio Times, 25 March 1952 String quartets in C minor and E minor were published in 1933 and 1938, and piano trios in 1935 and 1943.. He also wrote Cortege for four cellos (1939, published 1941) and a Suite in D for viola and piano (1938). Miniatures for violin and piano included Four Fancies (1923), Fireflies (Op. 18/20), the Variations (1927) and Autumn Voices written just prior to his death.. Holland's music for solo piano, included Variations on a Swedish Air (1906), and Preludes (1944). A number of his works used remote keys, including Toccata in E-flat minor, the Sonatina in F-sharp minor (both 1938), and the Variations on an Original Theme, also in F-sharp minor. Song compositions included the Opus 4 and Opus 6 sets, set to German words, two Shelley songs (1908) and three Flecker songs (1938). Philip Scowcroft considers his most important vocal items to be The Songs from Nyasaland (Opus 20), for voice and orchestra, published with piano accompaniment, and the cantata A Pastoral Medley. Holland's style has been described as \\"idiosyncratic and colourful\\" and as \\"best suited to theatre\\". However, a small number of his concert works achieved moderate success. A suite based on music for a children's play, Santa Claus (produced at the London Scala in 1912) was frequently broadcast at Christmas time during the 1920s and 1930s. His Trio in E minor, performed by the Grinke Trio, was broadcast on the BBC Home Service in 1935Radio Times, 8 June 1935 and again in 1940.Radio Times, 25 October 1940 Ellingham Marshes for viola and orchestra was given its premi√®re at the Proms on 15 April 1940 and broadcast by the BBC on 7 April 1941.

Other caves surrounding the city of Junnar are: Manmodi Caves, Shivneri Caves and Lenyadri caves. The cave has circular Chaitya hall surrounded by twelve octagonal pillars around Stupa. These caves are one of the earliest caves of Junnar, excavated around 50 B.C. This Buddhist cave group consist of 11 cave. Now, cave No 4 is taken over by Hindus and converted into a temple of goddess Tulja Devi. Description The Tulja Lena caves lie in a hill about a mile and a half or two miles north-west from Junnar, beyond the north end of Sivaneri hill. They are so named, because one of them has been appropriated by the modern Brahmans as a shrine of Tulja Devi, a form of Bhavani, the consort of Shiva (see Tulja Bhavani Temple). The caves run along the face of the cliff nearly from south-east to north-west, facing about south-west, but all the fa√ßades have fallen away. They consist of a number of cells and two small viharas, with a Chaitya cave of a form quite unique. It is circular in plan, 25 feet 6 inches across, with a dagoba in the centre, 8 feet 2 inches in diameter, surrounded by twelve plain octagonal shafts 11 feet in height, supporting a dome over the dagoba. The surrounding aisle is roofed by a half arch rising from the wall to the upper side of an architrave 7 or 8 inches deep over the pillars. Tulja Caves from a distance. The dagoba is perfectly plain, but its capital has been hewn off to convert it into a huge linga of Shiva, and even the dome is much hacked into, while some of the pillars have been notched and others broken. In front of this cave and the one on each side of it is a platform built by the modern devotes of Tulja Devi. Over the front of one of the cells to the north-east of this are left some Chaitya-window ornamentation, a larger one over where the door has been, the inner arch of which is filled with knotted ribbons etc..., similar to what is over the Chaitya-cave door at the Nasik Caves, while the front of the arch is carved with flowers. On each side of this is a smaller arch; and farther to the left is a dagoba in half relief with the umbrella or chhatri over it, on each side a Gandharva or Kinnara above, and a male figure below, that to the right attended by a female, but all of them weatherworn.

When Mary came to the throne Philpot soon attracted attention. He was one who in the convocation of 1553 defended the views of the catechism, especially with reference to transubstantiation. Imprisonment, trial and martyrdom In 1554 he was in the King's Bench Prison, and even there he found something to dispute about, as some of his fellow prisoners were Pelagians. In October 1555 he was examined in Newgate sessions house, and, though Bishop Bonner did his best for him, he was convicted. According to the Wikipedia version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs, he died on 16 January 1557 (not 1555 as an earlier version of this article proposed). Certainly, Tom Betteridge, in his essay 'Sodomy in John Bale and John Foxe (in 'Sodomy in Early Modern Europe' Ed Tom Betteridge) remarks that in 1556 Philpot was writing to John Careless! (p20) Writings Philpot wrote : # 'Vera Expositio Disputationis', an account of the proceedings in convocation, printed in Latin at Rome, 1554, and in English at Basle, and afterwards printed in Foxe's ' Actes and Monuments.' # 'Examinations', published London, 1559. Foxe published a Latin translation of this abroad, and it appears in the ' Actes and Monuments.' To one edition of this was added # 'Apologie of John Philpot' written for spitting upon an Arian; a second edition appeared the same year (1559). # 'A Supplication to Philip and Mary,' published by Foxe in the 'Actes and Monuments.' # 'Letters', also published in the 'Actes and Monuments', and separately 1564. # 'Caelius Secundus Curio : his Defence of th' Olde and Awncyent Authoritie off Christe's Churche'; this translation forms Reg. MS. 17, C. ix. # 'De Vero Christiani Sacrificio.' # A translation of Calvin's ' Homilies.' # 'Chrysostome against Heresies.' # 'Epistolae Hebraicae' lib. i. # 'De proprietate Linguarum' lib. i. The last five are lost. An exhortation to his sister and an oration which forms Bodl. MS. 53 are also small works. There are said to be some manuscripts written by Philpot in the library at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

The Uttarakhand flood was caused by record off-season monsoon rains, cloud burst, floods, flash floods, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which were possibly induced by climate change. The humanitarian disaster affected millions, stranded over 100,000 pilgrims and tourists in Himalayan religious sites, and killed several thousand people. The Indian Army's Lucknow based Central Command conducted the operation. Surya or Sun, is the emblem of the Central Command and features prominently on the Command's formation sign and flag, which is probably why Central Command chose to name the effort Operation Surya Hope. Operation Surya Hope was the follow-up to Operation Ganga Prahar. The operation was commanded by Lieutenant General Anil Chait, the General Officer Commanding in Chief (GOC in C) of Central Command. He was succeeded by Lieutenant General Rajan Bakhshi on 1 July 2013. Soon after assuming command, Bakhshi said that the Army would continue with the relief operations, and that he would soon visit Uttarakhand. Over 10,000 troops participated in Operation Surya Hope. It was conducted in arrangement with efforts from the Indian Air Force (IAF) (Operation Rahat), Border Road Organization, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and other para military forces under the Ministry of Home. The floods and landslides in Uttarakhand was considered by many as the worst natural disaster in the area in a hundred years. The Government of India classifies the disaster as a tsunami.http://reliefweb.int/report/india/himalaya-tsunami-creates-havoc- north-india-death-toll-crosses-1000 India Meteorological Department (IMD) states that the total rainfall in Uttarakhand from 1 to 18 June 2013 totaled to 385.1 mm, the highest in the last 80 years. The normal rainfall during the period is 71.3 mm, making the total 440% larger than the normal.  Early warning  India has an elaborate multi-tier and multi-agency natural disaster and flood Early Warning (EW) system, both at the Central and the State levels. Federal nodal agencies responsible for providing EW are: * Floods ‚Äì Central Water Commission * Landslide hazard ‚Äì Geological Survey of India (GSI) * Avalanche ‚Äì Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO) * Disaster Management Support (DMS) ‚Äì Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) * Weather- India Metrological Department (IMD). Out of all the agencies above, only the India Meteorological Department warned of the tsunami that struck Uttarakhand in June 2013. The Central Water Commission, under the Union Ministry of Water Resources, made its first flood forecast for the year for Uttarakhand after the event on 18 June which impacted Rishikesh and Haridwar. The IMD's warnings had little effect, and few moved to safer places. Both the state and central government ignored the early warning. The State Government didn't issue any form of advisory to the residents or the pilgrims in the affected areas. Uttarakhand Chief Secretary Subhash Kumar also dismissed the IMD advisory.  Organizations  The area of responsibility for the humanitarian assistance mission included the heavily flood affected areas of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. The mission boundary in the north runs along the India-Tibet border, in the east it runs along the India Nepal border, and in the west it goes up to the western boundary of the Garhwal Division. The areas covered by the mission included Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Rudraprayag Badrinath, Hemkund Joshimath, Harsil, Gauchar, Kedarnath Kedarghati, Rajakhet, Koti Tehri, Gauri Kund, in the Garhwal Division, Dharchula, the Pithoragarh district, and the Kumaon Division. = Disaster management and disaster preparedness = In India's federal system, the state government holds the responsibility for disaster management. The national government plays a ‚Äòsupporting role‚Äô. The ‚Äònodal Ministry‚Äô in the central government for management of natural disasters, is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). In the MHA this function is discharged by the Disaster Management Division (DM Division). When \\"calamities of severe nature\\" occur, the Central Government is responsible for providing aid and assistance to the affected state, as may be needed, including the deploying, at the State‚Äôs request, of Armed Forces, Central Paramilitary Forces, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and such communication, air and other assets, as are available and needed. The response of the central government is based on \\"gravity of a natural calamity\\" and the \\"scale of the relief operation\\". The ‚Äúapex Body for Disaster Management\\" in India, mandated by the Disaster Management Act, 2005, is the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The NDRF, under the NDRM consists of 12 battalions, and is organised along the lines of a paramilitary force. The NDRF has several flag rank officers, and its Director General wears the uniform and badges of rank of an army three- star general. = Armed forces = Uttarakhund On 19 June, the day Operation Ganga Prahar became Operation Surya Hope, and the strength of the Army in the affected area was 5,600. By 27 June 2013, the Army's numbers in the mission area had increased to above 8,500. Army's disaster response units included infantry battalions, Army Service Corps units to provide Logistic and Supply support, signals regiment, engineer regiments, advance dressing stations and other medical units, special forces, specialised mountain troops, paratroopers, and army aviation corps assets. The Army Aviation Corps deployed 13 helicopters (nine on 19 June and an additional four the next day). This is the largest humanitarian mission by the Indian Army in several decades. By 23 June, the total number of aircraft involved in the evacuation, relief, rescue, and search tasks, according to government sources, was 83 (IAF-45, Army-13, state government hired civil helicopters- 25). The helicopters carried out their mission in hazardous mountain conditions, often in rain and fog, in what one pilot called a \\"war like situation\\". On 24 June, Air Chief Marshal Norman Anil Kumar Browne, the Chief of the Indian Air-force, to assure the people cut off in the mountains, by the bad weather, road blocks, and the floods, said \\"Our helicopter rotors will not stop churning till such time we get each one of you out. Do not lose hope, and hang in there.\\" The next day, 25 June, to high light the hazardous conditions of flying, an IAF Mi 17, Russian built helicopter, flying in poor visibility, in a narrow valley, crashed into the mountain side killing all 20 on board (5 IAF, 6 ITBP, and 9 NDRF personnel). The Indian Navy, too, had a small presence in the mission area. The Navy's marine commandos (Marcos), were deployed to Rudraprayag, and Rishikesh, for rescue and search missions. It is not known what task, if any, was performed by this group. = Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) = The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) deployed 13 teams (a total of 422 persons) from two NDRF battalions in six locations, as follows: five teams (174 personnel) in Rudraprayag District, three teams (89 personnel) in the Haridwar area, one team (33 personnel) in Guptkashi, one team (29 personnel) in Lakshar, one team (40 personnel) in Gaurikund, one team (45 personnel) in Dehradun, and one team (12 personnel) at Jolly Grant Airport. The NDRF mission was to assist the \\"State Government for search and rescue operations\\". The strength of Indo- Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in the affected area as on 20 June 13 was 600 personnel: 300 from the Ist ITBP Battalion in the Joshimath area, and 300 from the 8th ITBP Battalion in Kedarnath, Gaurikund, and Gaucher.  Conduct  For relief and rescue operations, the Army divided the affected areas into four axes, or sub sectors: [1] Rishikesh ‚Äì Uttarkashi ‚Äì Harsil ‚Äì Gangotri axis [2] Rudraprayag ‚Äì Kedarnath axis [3] Joshimath ‚Äì Badrinath axis and Dharchhula ‚Äì Tawaghat axis, and [4] Pithoragarh district, in Kumaon division. The Army's response plan consisted of three broad phases. Phase One, 19‚Äì20 June; Phase Two, 21‚Äì22 June; and Phase Three, 23 June onwards. On 19‚Äì20 June, the Army conducted reconnaissance and carried out air evacuation of people stranded along Govindghat-Badrinath road, track from Ghagriya to Hemkund to Badrinath and Ghagriya. By evening 19 June, the Army had evacuated 1,610 civilians in Uttarkashi district, 3,034 in Joshimath sector, and 1,550 people from Govindghat. Shelter, food and medical aid had been provided to 1,300 people in the Uttarkashi area and 1,276 in Joshmith, while medical teams had treated 300 people in Joshimath, 150 in Harsil, and 70 in Rudraprag. By evening on 20 June the Army reported that it had \\"rescued more than 11000 people, mainly from Govindghat and Harsil\\", and was sheltering, feeding, and providing medical assistance to about 10,000. On 20 June the army opened the road up to Uttarkashi, and to Sonprayag on Kedarnath axis. On the same day it launched a bridge across Vasuki Ganga between Mundkatiya and Sonprayag, and started work on the repair of the bridge over Alaknanda between Govindghat and Ghagria on Hemkund Sahib track. On 20 June, the army, started work on the maintenance and improvement, and expansion of helipad at Gagaria on Hemkund Sahib axis to make it ready to accommodate the larger MI-17 helicopter to allow for speedier aerial evacuation. Following aerial reconnaissance on 19 June, the army on 21 June dropped Paratroopers in Rudraprayag-Kedarnath, Jungle Chatti, and other in accessible areas to establish contact with to stranded pilgrims and commence relief and evacuation operations. Simultaneously, it establishes \\"heli-bridge-air shuttle service between Jungle Chatti and Gaurikund\\". On 21‚Äì22 June, the army's ground troops moved to Sonprayag and Kedarnath, to build infrastructure to receive, move, assist, treat, and hold the affected people. On 23 June, phase three of the Army's operation began. The priorities of phase three included relief, rescue, search, and evacuation operations. The army worked on securing, marking, and improving helipads; repairing and installing bridges; improving and restoring tracks; establishing staging areas, transit areas, reception centres, medical aid posts; escorting and guiding people; providing food, water, shelter, and medical aid to the affected population, and most importantly providing through their presence, example, and leadership, hope, and encouragement to the stranded population. A steel foot bridge across Alaknanda at Lambagar in Badrinath Valley, by the army engineers, was under construction, on 26 June 13, to facilitate the cross river evacuation. As of 26 June Surya Hope had delivered 24 tons of food, fuel, medicines, blankets and relief material and evacuated 33,000 people, including 2,715 by thirteen helicopters of the Army Aviation Corps, which clocked over 600 sorties. Special troops trained in high altitude search, rescue, and relief work, including paratroopers and heli-borne troops, were deployed on search and rescue missions in the Kedarnath and Badrinath axis, along Arva Tal on Gangotri ‚Äì Mana axis, and in the Pindari Glacier, and Sunder Dunga Glacier in Kumaon region, to search, rescue, and assist, stranded civilians. Medical aid formed an important component of the mission. Doctors from Army Medical Corps (AMC), and nurses from the Military Nursing Service were amongst the lead elements to be deployed in the area. By 19 June it was reported that 12 self-sufficient medical teams were deployed in the area. An emergency medical helpline was opened, and military communication channels were provided to affected people to speak with their families and friends. By 25 June the strength of ‚Äòself sufficient‚Äô military medical posts, it was reported, had increased to 29. An ‚ÄòAccident and Emergency Services Medical Centre‚Äô was established at Joshimath Helipad. These medical posts were manned by Army doctors, nurses, and para-medics. Medical camps were reported ready at Gothi, Dharchula, Gauridham, Tijam, and the Military Hospital at Pithoragarh, was opened for civilian casualties along the Pithoragarh ‚Äì Dharchula ‚Äì Tawaghat axis. Thousands of patients were provided medical attention at these facilities daily. In addition, the IAF deployed Air Force Rapid Action Medical Teams, with the air stations, and detachments. On 26 June a team of two psychiatrists from the Army Medical Corps(AMC) opened a post disaster and trauma counselling centre in the Joshimath sector, to provide counselling to the civil population stranded at Badrinath and Kedarnath. The same day teams from the Army Veterinary Corps consisting of a veterinary doctor and two paramedics were inserted by helicopter to establish Animal Aid Posts along the Hemkund axis to take care of ponies and mules stranded in the area. Similar aid posts were planned for Gauri Kund. In addition to humanitarian operations in the high Himalayas, Central Command carried out rescue, relief, and assistance missions in the flood affected areas on the plains in Uttar Pradesh. Six Army humanitarian columns were deployed on 20 June to cover the Pilibhit, Muzaffarnagar, Laksar and Amroha districts in Uttar Pradesh. Two columns were deployed for missions in Saharanpur and Bijnor districts. In the plains the army assisted with evacuation of flood affected persons, and construction of anti-flood bunds.  Appraisal  The Government of Uttarakhand, and Vijay Bahuguna, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, have been blamed for not taking heed of the meteorological departments warning, failing to issue timely evacuation advisory, for being ill-prepared, for tardy and disorganised response, and poor leadership. Some have suggested that it was not a natural disaster but a man made disaster. Chief Minister Bahuguna denied that it was a man made disaster stating that \\"There was no delay\\" and that \\"more than a lakh people were evacuated without any law and order problem, so credit should go to the government\\", adding \\"I don't agree that it is a man- made disaster. Calamities are not in our control. I cannot control tsunami, earthquake or cloudburst.\\" The army's and the IAF's performance and discipline, in the response to the Humanitarian crisis in Uttarakhand, has been widely applauded. The performance of the NDMA and the NDRF, organisations which are well-funded, has been faulted. It was criticised for providing a tardy, sloppy response to the disaster and for failing \\"miserably in its first major challenge\\". There was no clear accounting of the dead, injured and missing, even two weeks after the flash floods struck the state on 17 June. As late as 2 July 2013, official figures for the dead and missing varied between of 800 to over 10,000. Govind Singh Kunjwal, Uttarakhand Assembly Speaker, and the NDMA's vice-chairman, Shashidhar Reddy, on 1 July, estimated that \\"more than 10,000\\" were killed by the floods. The Home Ministry estimate of the death toll was lower at 800. Vijay Bahuguna, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, thought that the death toll \\"will exceed 1000\\". Controversially on 1 July, he said, \\"We will never know the exact number of the dead and the number of people buried or washed away.\\" Even for the missing there were varied estimates. The Uttarakhand Police estimated the missing to be no more than 500. NDMA, UN agencies, and NGOs, estimates on 2 July for 'missing' was upward of 10,000. A week later on 8 July Vijay Bahuguna, the Chief Minister, said over 4000 were missing, of whom 795 were from Uttarakhand, his home state. On 15 July, the official toll for the disaster was 580 confirmed dead, and 5,748 missing (924, from Uttarakhand and 4,824 are from other Indian states). The Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna confirmed that Uttarakhand was not issuing death certificates, ‚ÄúWe are only giving some monetary help to the family.‚Äù \\"The total fatalities for the purposes of compensation thus is 6328. The state authorities have decided to treat the ‚Äòmissing‚Äô as presumed dead for the purposes of compensation, even though the usual time lag between being ‚Äòmissing‚Äô and being declared dead is seven years. The next of kin of the dead and the ‚Äòmissing‚Äô will be paid Rupees 500,000 ($8,394). Residents of Uttarakhand will be paid by the state government. Those from other states will be paid 350, 000 by the central government, and 150,000, by the state government.\\"  Timeline  13 June 2013: Meteorological Department (IMD), Dehradun, forecast \\"heavy to very heavy rainfall in the upper regions of Uttarakhand in the next 48 to 72 hours\\".

The village is located on the eastern part of the island of Halsn√∏ya. It is one of the largest urban areas on the island, just after S√¶b√∏vik and Eidsvik. While originally one of the island's largest farming villages, today it is renowned for its position in Norwegian shipping industry. Until 1964, the village was divided between two municipalities: Fjelberg and Sk√•nevik, with the border running in parallel with today's main road called Slettanesveien. Since 1964, it has been part of Kvinnherad municipality. Name The name H√∏ylandsbygd is made up of two parts: \\"h√∏yland\\" and \\"bygd\\". \\"H√∏yland\\" is Norwegian for \\"the high lands\\", and bygd is Old Norse for \\"district\\" or \\"settlement\\". The name loosely translates to \\"the settlement in the high lands\\", and references the early farms and settlements which were built in the higher fields of the village.Norsk stadnamnsleksikon, 1997 History =Early history (600-1600)= The geographical area that is H√∏ylandsbygd today was originally farmland under the large farm of Hauge, which has been inhabited and used as farmland since at least c. 650 A.D., with findings confirming the presence of settlements both along the village coast and where the main farmhouses are today. There is a written record of the inhabitants since the 12th century,Sk√•nevikssoga Bind 1, p. 83-84 which also shows that the farm was divided into five sections during the 13th century: Hauge, Mehus, Bj√∏rgjo, Tveito/Berhaug, and Mjelkevik, the latter two of which were extensions of Hauge rather than their own, separate farms. As the Black Plague hit Norway in 1349-1350, the farms were hit heavily, with only Hauge and Mehus having survivors, and the other three being either abandoned or incorporated into other farms. Bj√∏rgjo was sold to the Halsn√∏y Abbey landlords, and remained in their possession until the 1580s, while Tveito and Mjelkevik were incorporated into Hauge as farmland. During the following centuries, the farms grew in numbers, with the remaining farms gradually being divided into several farms, as well as the western parts of today's village being built on to make new settlements. By the 17th century, the number of inhabitants had grown to more than 200, an impressive number in those times. = Farming village (1600 - 1850) = By the early 17th century, there was more than ten major farms in today's H√∏ylandsbygd, and it had become one of the biggest farming villages in the region. There was a large variety of goods produced, from meat to corn and wool, and the village became one of the first to have organized export of goods to the neighbouring villages and regions, in addition to providing for themselves. The number of farms kept growing, and at its peak in 1822, the village had twenty-one separately registered farms.Sk√•nevikssoga Bind 1, p. 85-87 During the following years, as urbanisation began to affect the country in general, the number of farms and inhabitants began to decrease, and most the smaller farms were incorporated into the larger ones. By 1850, the number of farms and inhabitants were 11 and 217, respectively, and by 1875, this number had shrunk to 9 and 174.SSB: Statistics for Hordaland county, 1800-1900, www.ssb.no = Shipping village (1850 onwards) = As the Industrial Revolution reached Norway in the 1850s, most of the inhabitants of the small farming villages left for the cities, Bergen and Christiania (now: Oslo) in particular, leaving the farms with a shortage of workers. The number of farms was shortened, with several farms merging or closing down. Meanwhile, the introduction of new tools and machines, along with the villages prime location near the coast, opened up for a new industry: shipbuilding. At the turn of the century, there was three main builders in H√∏ylandsbygd, who all produced wooden fishing boats. By 1920, only two remained, and they merged to form a large ship building plant in central H√∏ylandsbygd, where Eide Marine Services, the current incarnation of the plant, has its offices today. Continuing to produce wooden vessels, mainly for fishing, the plant produced 42 ships from 1920 to 1950, all by hand. The founder, Georg Eide Sr. (December 9, 1896 ‚Äì October 16, 1951), remained in charge of the company until his sudden death in 1951, resulting in temporary closure.. In 1955, the company was reformed as Georg Eides S√∏nner by his sons Gerhard and Johannes Eide. They continued focus on building wooden vessels for the fishing industry, and during the first decade, the company grew fast. By the 1970s the company was one of the leading job suppliers in the local community, and by 1980, the number of inhabitants in the village had doubled. While the growth stagnated during the early 90s, the number of inhabitants has remained stable at above 400. Today, Eide Marine Services is one of the largest maritime service companies in Norway, providing jobs for several hundreds.  Schools and services  The local elementary school, Hauge skule, was in operation from 1964 to 2011, with renovations in 1979 and 2004. Prior to 1964, the village had several small school houses, common in Norway at this time, from the late 18th century until 1964, when the new school was completed. In 2011, all pupils were moved to a new school that gathered all the pupils on Halsn√∏y, while the kindergarten service remained. In addition to public school, the village has had a general store since 1955, and also had postal and banking offices until 1995, when services were centralized to S√¶b√∏vik. The village has semi-hourly bus connections to the rest of Halsn√∏y and Kvinnherad, and had a ferry service until 1982.

O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs plan was to defeat Manus O'Donnell from the Kinel-Connell and thus be the only King in Ulster. Preparation O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs army consisted of people from Oriel, modern day Counties Armagh, Louth and Monaghan and from Dundalk, County Louth. Also, part of O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs army was Hugh O‚ÄôDonnell (brother of Calvagh) and his followers. They marched from their stronghold in Tyrone until they reached Carraig Laith (Carrickalee, Strabane, County Tyrone). O‚ÄôNeill set up his camp here which lies between the River Mourne and River Finn. Carraig Laith is close to where the two rivers meet to create the River Foyle. The Kinel-Connell was in turmoil at this time as Calvagh O'Donnell had his father locked up for two years so that he himself could be ruler of the O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs and O‚ÄôDonnell lands. Calvagh, unsure of what to do in the event of an attack from the O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs consulted with his father who advised not to attack the O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs but to wait until they crossed the river and then to attack their camp at Carraig Laith. Calvagh who had sent his cattle into the wilds of Tirconnell to protect them from the O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs, but on hearing this John O‚ÄôNeill declared that even if they got passed his army with their animals he would follow them until they submitted to his authority. O‚ÄôNeill and his army left their camp in Tyrone, crossing the River Finn and marched towards Raphoe then along the Lagganhttp://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/history-of- ireland/the-ulster-plantation/the-plantation-of-the-lag/ date= 07 April 2018 to a place called Baile-aighidh-chaoin, where they set up a new camp. This is now known as Balleeghan townland, close to the banks of Lough Swilly in Raymoghy Parish. Calvagh who was at a meeting on the summit of Bennin (Binnion). (Binnion Hill can be found four kilometres north-west of Porthall and eight kilometres north of Lifford). Others with Calvagh were his son Con and Walter McSweeney, who had brought two companies of gallowglasses of the McSweeney‚Äôs of Fanad, also there was Donnell Gorm McSweeney and his followers who were the descendants of Donnell. Attack Two members of Calvagh‚Äôs party were sent to spy on the O‚ÄôNeill camp and report back to Calvagh at Binnion. On hearing the testimony of the spying mission Calvagh decide to attack John O‚ÄôNeill and his forces at his camp immediately. The troops of Calvagh numbering two battalion‚Äôs marched on the O‚ÄôNeill camp and began killing and slaughtering all before them. John O‚ÄôNeill on hearing the commotion in his camp realised that he was under attack and fearing for his life slipped out of the back of his tent. Two other people escaped with O‚ÄôNeill that night, namely Hugh O‚ÄôDonnell (son of Manus) and Donough O‚ÄôGallagher (son of Felim Finn). The three men in their retreat back into Tyrone had to cross the River Deele, River Finn and the River Derg by swimming across them and as it had been raining heavily that night the rivers were very swollen, making it even more dangerous. On reaching Tearmonn-Ui-Moain, he bought a horse and made his way to Aireagal-da-Chiarog http://www.cotyroneireland.com/rental/Errigal- Keerogue.html by morning. Meanwhile back at battle site Calvagh and his men were in high spirits and enjoying the spoils of war. In the morning when the booty was being divided up Con (son of Calvagh) got as his portion eighty horses, the prize of all the horses was Shane O'Neill‚Äôs (son of John) own horse called ‚ÄòThe Son of the eagle‚Äô.

This cave group has 16 Buddhist caves. The caves were excavated in first century B.C. The construction on wooden pattern is notable. One can reach the cave by descending from Rajmachi village. The cave only one inscription on the front of the Chaitya, which gives information about donors. Description About 14 km from the Karjat station, on Central Railway, and at the base of the old hill fort of Rajmachi, is the Kondane group of caves, first brought to notice in the 19th century by Vishnu Sastri, and soon after visited by Mr. Law, then collector of Thana. They are in the face of a steep scarp, and quite hidden from view by the thick forest in front of them. Water trickles down over the face of the rock above them during a considerable part even of the dry season, and has greatly injured them. So much so indeed that it is now difficult to determine whether they or the caves at Bhaja Caves are the earliest. They must be nearly, if not quite contemporary, and as they must have taken some time to excavate, their dates may overlap to some extent. The Vihara at Kondane certainly looks more modern, while the Chaitya, which is very similar in plan and dimensions to that at Bhaja, is so much ruined that it is impossible now to decide which may have been first completed. =Cave No1: Chaitya= They face north-west, and the first to the south-west is a Chaitya-cave of very considerable dimensions, being 66.5 feet from the line of the front pillars to the extremity of the apse, 26 feet 8 inches wide, and 28 feet 5 inches high to the crown of the arch. The nave in front of the dagoba is 49 feet in length by 14 feet 8 inches, and the dagoba 9.5 feet in diameter, with a capital of more than usual height, the neck representing the relic casket being, as at Bhaja, of double the ordinary height, and representing two coffers, one above the other, carved on the sides with the Buddhist rail pattern. The fillets that covered this are decayed, as is also the whole of the lower part of the dagoba. Chaitya dagoba. Chaitya fa√ßade detail. The bases with the lower parts of all the thirty columns that surrounded the nave, as well as that of one of the two irregular columns that once ornamented the front, have also decayed, and positions only of most of them can now be ascertained. Between these two latter pillars a wooden screen or front originally filled the opening to a height of about 10 or 12 feet, in which were the doorways leading to the interior and it was fixed to them, as seems to have been the case with all the earlier caves. The Chaitya Cave at Bhaja and that at Kondane had similar fronts constructed in wood. The caves at Bedsa and Karla are apparently among the earliest, where these screens were carved in the rock instead of being erected in the more perishable material.The Chaitya.Remain of the sculpture of a head, with inscription. There are still, however, remains of seven pillars on the left side of the cave, and six on the south, which rake inwards, as do also those at Bhaja and Bedsa, a proof of the early date of the work; those behind the dagoba and six near the front on the right side have disappeared entirely. On the upper portion of one column on the left is a symbol or device somewhat resembling a dagoba, with a rude canopy over it. The arched roof has had wooden rafters as at Karle and elsewhere, but they are gone, and the only remains of the woodwork is a portion of the latticed screen in the front arch. The fa√ßade bears a strong family likeness to that at Bhaja. On the left side is a fragment of sculpture in high-relief part of the head of a single figure about twice life-size. The features are destroyed, but the details of the headdress show the most careful attention to finish of detail. Over the left shoulder is an inscription in one line in Brahmi characters which reads: Kanvasa antevasina Balakena katam (\\"Made by Balakena, the pupil of Kanha (Krishna)\\"). Over this head, at the level of the spring of the great arch in the facade, is a broad projecting belt of sculpture: the lower portion of it is carved with the rail pattern ; the central portion is divided into seven compartments, filled alternately, three with a lattice pattern and five with human figures, one male in the first, a male and female in each of the third and fifth, and a male with a bow and two females in the seventh. Over these is a band with the representations of the ends of tie-beams or bars projecting through it, and then four fillets, each projecting over the one below, and the upper half of the last serrated. The corresponding belt of carving on the right side of the facade is much damaged by the falling away of the rock at the end next the arch. =Cave No.2: Vihara= Interior of a vihara. A little to north-east is No. II., a Vihara, of which the front of the veranda is totally destroyed except the left end. This verandah was 5 feet 8 inches wide and 18 feet long, with the unique number of five octagon pillars and two antae. In the end of this veranda is a raised recess, and under a Chaitya arch is a small dagoba in half relief, apparently the only object of worship when these caves were excavated. Inside, the hall is 23 feet wide by 29 deep, and 8 feet 3 inches high, with 15 pillars arranged about 3 feet apart and from the side and back walls, but none across the front. The upper portions of these pillars are square, but about 1.5 feet from the top they are octagonal: the bases of all are gone, but they also were probably square. Veranda of the vihara. The roof is panelled in imitation of a structural hall with beams 19 inches deep by 8 thick, 3.5 feet apart, running across through the heads of the pillars, and the spaces between divided by smaller false rafters, 5 inches broad by 2 deep. There are three wide doors into the hall, though most of the front wall is broken away, and on each side six cells in all, each with the monk's bed in it, and the first on each side with two. Over the doors of 14 of these cells are carved Chaitya or horse-shoe arches, connected by a string course projecting 6 or 7 inches and carved with the rail pattern. =Cave No.3= Cave No.3 is a plain Vihara with nine cells, much ruined, especially in front, but it had probably three doors. =Cave No.4= No.4 has row of nine cells at the back of what now looks like a natural hollow under the cliff. Beyond them is a tank, now filled with mud, then two cells under a deep ledge of over-hanging rock, and, lastly, a small cistern.

Note the √©vas√©e rim. Waddle fans, sometimes incorrectly spelled Waddell, were large centrifugal fans, used to ventilate coal mines. They were distinguished both by their extremely large size and by the fan having an integral shroud and so being able to be mounted in the open air.  Waddle Engineering and Fan Company  They were built by the Waddle Engineering and Fan Company Limited, in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. Their archives are now held by Carmarthenshire Archives and the Richard Burton Archives at Swansea University. The fans were most common in their local area of South Wales, but they were also widely used in other mining areas in England. Waddle Engineering were in business from 1830 to 1970. Their distinctive fan always worked at relatively slow speed and so was most suitable for steam engine drive. As high speed fans driven by electric motors became more common, Waddle failed to make this transition.  Operation  40' fan at Nixon's Navigation Colliery Air entered the fan through the central eye and exited through the rim. These fans were thus all suction devices, extracting air from a mine and releasing it to the atmosphere. A typical installation comprised a pit head building, usually built of stone at this period, with a fan engine house alongside it. The fan was mounted high in the gap between the buildings, with a connection into the pithead through a circular window in the building and into the eye of the fan.These distinctive circular windows may still be recognised in surviving old pithead buildings. The pithead was made airtight against its reduced internal pressure by shuttered windows and close-fitting doors. If the same building was also used for winding ‚Äì the lowering and raising of men and equipment ‚Äì the winding gear could be mounted in the clear space above the shaft, without interfering with the fan arrangements. Mine cages and trams passed through the usual self-closing air doors. The Waddle design's distinctive feature was its self-shrouded or 'caseless' design, where the rotating fan formed its own enclosure. Although small fans of this form are common today, Waddle were the only company to make them of this size, or for mine ventilation. After the Hartley Colliery Disaster in 1862, mine owners were compelled to improve mine ventilation. Ventilation was now required to include separate shafts for down-cast and up-cast airflow, and for ventilation to be provided by fans rather than the older furnace system.Effectively a thermosyphon system. This encouraged sales of ventilation fans, particularly the Waddle. As the fan impeller formed its own shroud, it required little additional installation and so was relatively easy to retro-fit to an existing pithead. These fans moved at relatively low speeds, usually being driven by rope drives from a horizontal steam engine on the ground floor below the fan. They always had one single impeller and so to achieve the large air volumes required, they were of large diameter. Although made in a range of sizes, a common large-size fan was 40 ft in diameter. Using a single impeller was common for large ventilation fans, although some makers used a double sided impeller to give twice the airflow for a similar rotating mass. Waddle though always used a single-sided impeller with an overhung bearing at the rear face of the fan. This avoided having the bearings placed in the often damp airstream, simplifying maintenance. The first fans were of simple design. An 1890 fan at Morton Colliery, Derbyshire, had a shallow conical impeller of 40 ft diameter and 1 ft 6in width at the rim. The internal blades were of extremely curved form. Its construction is simple, of flat wrought iron plates, joined by rivets and angle iron. Working at 45rpm, the fan moved 70,000 cubic feet of air per minute. Within a few years, the aerodynamics of the impeller had developed so that their operating speed and efficiency had increased substantially. An 1896 fan at Chanters Colliery, Tyldesley, Lancashire, was of the same overall dimensions and speed, but moved 150,000 cu ft / minute. The improvements of these later fans were the use of an outwardly flanged, curved √©vas√©e rim that gave smoother airflow at the rim and also straighter internal blades, for the higher speed fans. Later fans, after World War I, began to be driven by electric motors instead. These ran at higher speeds and so the large diameter fan was unsuitable, as its high linear air velocity at the rim led to turbulence and mechanical vibration. These fans began to be used as pairs of smaller fans (typically 17 ft) instead, although the Waddle design was basically unsuitable here, leading to its eventual demise.

It was created in Argentina and Chile after five years of research together in these countries. The formulation varies by market location, and in some areas the original formulation has been phased out in favor of a zero-calorie version sweetened with stevia only. Ingredients The drink contains stevia leaf extract, the first branded Coke product to use it. However, it is not the first product owned by the Coca-Cola Company to use stevia. Over 45 products distributed by Coca-Cola use stevia extract, including Vitamin Water and Seagram's Ginger Ale. Coca-Cola Life contains sugar, but uses less sugar than traditional Coca-Cola. An serving contains around 60 calories, 17 grams of carbohydrates of which 17 grams is sugar (equals 1/3 less sugar than traditional Coca-Cola). Packaging The drink comes in glass bottles, plastic bottles, and aluminum cans. The logo is a small green leaf. In 2018, a red disc was added behind the name for greater brand identification, as part of Coca-Cola's new \\"global packaging\\" scheme.http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/coca-cola-unveils-global- packaging/303613/ The plastic bottle is fully recyclable (like normal PET bottles) and 30 percent plant-based, with fossil-fuel plastic accounting for the remaining 70 percent of the bottle. Distribution Coca-Cola Life was launched in Argentina in June 2013, in Chile in November of that year, in Sweden in June 2014 and in the UK in September 2014. It has subsequently been launched in many other countries. Coca-Cola Life tried to co-exist with Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero in the Argentine and Chilean market, but it has been slowly removed from those markets due to its low reception from customers. Due to decrease in sales, and increase of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar sales, Coca-Cola Life was discontinued in the UK in June 2017. Coca-Cola Life has been available in: * Argentina * Armenia * Australia (branded as 'Coca-Cola with Stevia') * Austria * Belgium * Brazil (called Coca-Cola com Stevia) *Bulgaria * Canada (2015-2019) * Chile * Colombia *Costa Rica *Croatia *Cyprus *Czech Republic * Denmark (2016-2019) * Ecuador * Estonia * France * Germany * Greece * Italy * Ireland * Japan, 2015 * Latvia * Lithuania * Luxembourg * Malta * Malaysia * Namibia * Netherlands * New Zealand * Norway (2015-2017) * Philippines * Poland * Romania * Russia * Singapore * Slovakia * South Africa * South Korea * Sweden (2014-2017) * Switzerland * Ukraine (since 2017) * United Arab Emirates * United States = Australia = Coca-Cola Life was introduced into Australia in March 2015. In early 2017, the brand was dropped due to poor sales and replaced with 'Coca-Cola with Stevia', which contains less sugar than Coca-Cola Life. = Belgium & Luxembourg = Coca-Cola Life was introduced in Belgium and Luxembourg in early 2015. Distribution was stopped in September 2018. = Canada = The roll-out of Coca-Cola Life in Canada began in the fall of 2016. In Canada, the product is sweetened from natural sources and contains 50% fewer calories than regular colas. The nutrition data on the Canadian version of product shows 25g carbohydrates (25g sugar), 100 calories and 70 mg sodium and 15 mg potassium per 500ml. By early 2020, the product was replaced with \\"Coca-Cola Stevia\\", a zero-calorie drink which is sweetened with stevia only; the \\"Coca-Cola Life\\" logo remains on the back of packaging for continuity. Ingredients (sugar/stevia formulation): Carbonated water, sugar, caramel colour, natural flavour, phosphoric acid, sodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, stevia extract, caffeine, and citric acid. = New Zealand = In May 2018, Coca-Cola Life was replaced in New Zealand by Coca-Cola Stevia No Sugar. = Switzerland = Coca-Cola Life was introduced in Switzerland in 2015 and withdrawn in March 2018. Boxes of 12 pack 12oz (355ml) Coca-Cola life on the store shelf in the United States in April 2019 =United States= Coca-Cola Life was released in limited areas in Summer 2014 with the product being sold at a number of locations of The Fresh Market grocery store. Nationwide distribution began on November 4, 2014. The release of Coca-Cola Life is the first Coca-Cola product launch in the U.S. since 2006. The nutrition data on the US version of product shows 24g carbohydrates (24g sugar), 90 calories and 35 mg sodium. The can label indicates 28 mg caffeine per 12 fl.oz.Product label on 12oz can sold in the US Market.

Before the full-scale national launch, the market research firm Haynes & Co. said that early research findings showed a positive view by consumers toward the drink. The company plans to host 4,000 events at stores where people can sample the drink for free. To help with its advertising and public marketing campaign, the company hired Fitzgerald and Company to develop strategy and promote the product on social media. =United Kingdom= Final revision of the Coca-Cola Life logo in the United Kingdom. Coca-Cola began offering the drink to U.K. customers in September 2014. The offering was the first new Coca-Cola product introduced in the U.K. in eight years. In 2016, it was reformulated and now contains even less sugar than regular Coke (45% less). On April 5, 2017, it was announced that due to a decrease in sales, and increase in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar sales, that Life would no longer be sold and it was discontinued in June 2017. The list of ingredients is carbonated water, cane sugar, caramel color, caffeine, phosphoric acid, and stevia. To promote the drink, at one event the company hired British model and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who promoted the drink at a launch party in London in September. In August, The Telegraph sent a correspondent, Harry Wallop, and a film crew onto the streets of Victoria to conduct a taste test of random people. In a video news segment produced from the taste test, Wallop says that most people could tell the difference in taste between Coca-Cola classic and Coca-Cola Life, although many people told him they preferred the taste of Life. In the United Kingdom, the Coca-Cola company has led several health initiatives, and it considers the introduction of Coca-Cola Life as a vital component to its initiatives. Specifically, the company promoted lower obesity rates and more active lifestyles among British people. The company insisted in connecting the roll-out of Life with its stance on promoting health. The Grocer magazine in the U.K. conducted a blind taste test among seven of its staff members in June. According to The Grocer, all seven tasters preferred the taste of Life to the other products. (The article in The Grocer did not specify which products Life was tested against.) However, all seven tasters said that they thought they had been tasting Coca-Cola Classic. =Argentina= In Argentina, the launch of Coca-Cola Life placed an emphasis on the recyclable bottle. The drink is distributed in Coca-Cola's \\"PlantBottle\\", which is made up of recyclable petroleum-based material plus around 30 percent plant-based material. Coca-Cola released a television ad in Argentina called \\"Parents\\" to promote Coca-Cola Life. Marketing in Argentina was focused, much like in the U.K, around healthy lifestyles. \\"Parents\\" is a humorous commercial featuring a young married couple receiving news about their first pregnancy. The commercial shows the parents going through common hardships of young parenthood, such as getting little sleep, having a toddler make a mess in the house, etc. Toward the end of the commercial, the father closes his eyes and takes a long drink from a Coca-Cola Life bottle. He opens his eyes, and while still drinking, his wife shows him a \\"positive\\" pregnancy test result. What appears to be a look of horror on the father's face (his eyes widen) turns into a look of joy and excitement. =Armenia= In Armenia, Coca-Cola Life is exclusively available in SAS supermarket. One can of 330ml costs around one US dollar. Malaysia Introduced January 2018, it is only available in 500ml quantities (as of January 2018). The product is sold for RM2 or roughly 0.50 USD per bottle at 7Eleven. Critics Critics opine Coca- Cola Life is simply a marketing gimmick or \\"greenwashing\\" of its outdated image with the original Coca-Cola drink.

Club career David Duncan began his club career at Afienya United in 1984 before moving to Premier Division side Great Olympics two years later. David Duncan mixed schooling with his football career but he had to take a number of years off to pursue his education. He was back with Afienya United for one season in the 1991/92 season when his team finished eighth in the league. He retired from playing in the 1994/95 season when his darling club Great Olympics finished sixth on the league log. Managerial career =Great Olympics= David Duncan started his coaching career as an assistant coach with Great Olympics in the early 2000s. In the 2002 season, he went for a short coaching course in Denmark but upon his return, J.E Sarpong who was head coach then had resigned for the second time in the season. when he was assistant to J.E Sarpong. On 17 May 2002, David Duncan was officially appointed as the head coach of Great Olympics. The young coach led Great Olympics to a respectable fourth position, and in effect bettering their previous season's finish by fourth places. David Duncan left Great Olympics at the end of the season having displayed superior style of football over the two giants of Ghana football, Accra Hearts of Oak and Asante Kotoko, but officiating went against them in the two games. =Sekondi Hasaacas= Duncan moved to giants of the West, Sekondi Hasaacas F.C., in 2003. He led the Sekondi side to an eighth place finish in his first season, one place behind his former team Great Olympics. Sekondi Hasaacas finished seventh the following season in the novelty league of the southern sector. =Black Starlets= Duncan was appointed the Coach of the Ghana U-17 in 2004. He won silver at the 2005 African Under-17 Championship in Gambia. The Black Starlets had a poor showing in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in Peru where they were eliminated in the first round, in the midst of public disagreements with GFA administrators. =Ashantigold= Ashanti Gold S.C. came calling for Duncan in 2006. The three-time Glo Premier League champions had fallen off the radar since their consecutive title triumphs between 1993 and 1996. In two seasons, Duncan finished second back-to-back for the Obuasi team. He led Ashantigold to victory in the Macufe Cup in 2006. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, Ashantigold finished 5 points off Champions Hearts of Oak in the league with 53 points. They managed the same point total in the 2007‚Äì08 season but they lost out to Asante Kotoko. =Free State Stars= Duncan had won suitors in South Africa when he took Ashantigold to win the Macufe Cup in 2006. Free State Stars was his next destination but he was only there for three months. In that short period of time, he led Free State Stars to victory in the Phakisa Cup in 2009 beating Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Chiefs. The Ghanaian coach left Free State Stars in August 2008 after they appointed Owen Da Gama as Technical Director of the club. =Ashantigold= He returned to Ashanti Gold in 2009. This time around, he finished second, again, with the Miners in a tight-race with Aduana Stars. The newly-promoted side beat Ashanti Gold to the 2009/10 season Glo Premier League title on head-to-head rule after they both finished with 53 points on the final day of the season. Ashantigold needed a draw at Berekum Chelsea F.C. but they lost on the final 1‚Äì0 away from home. It was a case of deja vu for David Duncan's Ashgold the following season when they placed second with 53 points and lost the league title to Berekum Chelsea. =Black Meteors= Duncan took the Ghana U-23, The Black Meteors, coaching duties in 2011. He was tasked to qualify the team for the London Olympics but they were knocked out by Sudan 2‚Äì1 on aggregate in the qualifiers. =Accra Hearts of Oak= He was appointed the head coach of Hearts of Oak in the 2012‚Äì13 season. Hearts of Oak had lost three, drawn once, and won two of their opening 6 games in the league. Former Black Stars skipper C.K. Akunnor was relieved of his duties and in his place, David Duncan was appointed the new head coach. On 18 November 2012 he led Accra Hearts of Oak to a goalless draw in Kumasi, against Asante Kotoko on his managerial debut for the Accra side. He won his first game the following week in 2‚Äì0 win over Liberty Professionals. Duncan's Hearts of Oak went seven games without a league victory ‚Äì drew 4 and lost 3. The poor form pushed Hearts of Oak into the relegation mire in the latter stages of the first round of the 2012‚Äì13 Glo Premier League season. However, results changed for the better in the second round for David Duncan's side. They amassed 35 points out of a possible 45 to finish the league season in fifth position, a point off third-placed Ebusua Dwarfs. Duncan also got Hearts of Oak to a first semi-final appearance in the FA Cup in 13 years. They lost 2‚Äì1 to Medeama in the semi-finals of the 2012‚Äì13 MTN FA CUP. The new Accra Hearts of Oak manager won his first trophy for the Continental Club Masters in the recently ended 2013 GHALCA President's Cup competition. He led his team, Hearts of Oak, to a 4‚Äì3 penalty win over Congolese giants TP Mazembe in the first day of the competition to progress to the finals of the President's Cup. In the finals, David Duncan's side broke the Medeama jinx by beating the fellow Premiership side 2‚Äì0 to lift the 2013 GHALCA President's Cup. 2013‚Äì14 Duncan started the new season with Accra Hearts of Oak on a very good note. He led his team to an away win over Edubiase United on the opening day of the season. However, he lost the second game of the season to bitter rivals Kumasi Asante Kotoko 0‚Äì1 at the Accra Sports Stadium after losing his key players, notably, Edubiase two-goal hero Emmanuel Hayford to injury, team captain Moro Abubakr to suspension, and a few others. His young side dominated the exchanges, missing countless glorious chances, but Kotoko snatched the points through a Seidu Bancey beauty in the 29th minute. Duncan's side put the disappointment of the derby defeat aside, and went on to win their next four games, beating new entrants Inter Allies 2‚Äì3, Sekondi Hasaacas 2‚Äì1, Bechem United 0‚Äì1, and Berekum Chelsea 1‚Äì0. They dropped points at the Kpando Park after taking a first half lead through Emmanuel Hayford, but Heart of Lions fought back to snatch a 1‚Äì1 draw. Hearts followed up with a 2‚Äì0 home win over Liberty Professionals. David Duncan succumbed to his former side Ashgold again, losing 1‚Äì0 at the Len Clay Stadium, before his side fought back to claw a point against Kumasi King Faisal in a 1‚Äì1 drawn game at the Accra Sports Stadium. The King Faisal game was David Duncan's last game in charge of Accra Hearts of Oak. He was asked to step aside on 8 November 2013 by the club. =After Hearts of Oak= Although, Accra Hearts of Oak insisted David Duncan's departure was a mutual agreement between both parties, the fans did not believe the explanation given for his departure. They organised a peaceful demonstration, led by supporters' leaders, Barima Atuahene, Maxwell Asabere, and members of the radical Chapter O group, to reinstate David Duncan as the coach of the club. The new group, opposing the sacking of David Duncan, succeeded in moving the coach back to the residential camp of the club ahead of a big game against Amidaus Professionals. Unperturbed by the sack, David Duncan gave a rousing speech to his players, and encouraged them to fight for the supporters in the next game. Hearts went on to win the game by a solitary goal with David Duncan in attendance (to fulfill his promise to his players). David Duncan has the third best league record of any Hearts (indigen) coach in the 21st century. His record is only bettered by, the celebrated Cecil Jones Attuquayefio and Herbert Addo (2002‚Äì2003). Duncan managed 39 (league and FA Cup) competitive games for Hearts of Oak. He won 21 games, drew 11, and lost 7, with his side scoring and conceding 56 and 29 goals respectively. David Duncan petitioned the Ghana Football Association to adjudicate a case of wrongful termination of contract by Hearts of Oak. After successfully weighing both sides of the case, the Ghana Football Association authorized Hearts of Oak to pay a record $40,000 as compensation to David Duncan for wrongful dismissal. In January 2015, David Duncan became head coach of Asante Kotoko on a two-year contract. =Kumasi Asante Kotoko= David Duncan was appointed coach of Kumasi Asante Kotoko on a two-year deal on Wednesday 18th March 2015. Kotoko were struggling in the season having accumulated 10 points from 10 games and lying precariously on 14th position on the Ghana Premier League log. The Porcupine Warriors had underwhelmed in the opening part of the season and having lost 0-1 to rivals Accra Hearts of Oak in the fifth league game of the season, they needed a massive lift and Duncan's appointment did just that. In the next 20 games that followed, Kotoko won 11, drew 4 and lost five times. Before Duncan's appointment, the Porcupines trailed eventual league winners Ashanti Gold by 12 points. But he had bridged that gap to just two solitary points come the end of the season. Kotoko became the most improved side in the league, leaping from the 14th position to finish second on the league log. Duncan also led Kotoko to the finals of the 2015 Ghanaian FA Cup where they lost under controversial circumstances to Medeama Sporting Club. Despite the minor low, Duncan's Kotoko went on to beat league winners Ashgold in the finals of the SWAG CUP in 2015. = 2016 season = David Duncan's Kotoko began the new season just like they had finished the previous by winning the GHALCA SIX - a preseason tournament for the teams that finished in the top 6 the previous season. Ashgold, Aduana Stars, Berekum Chelsea, Hearts, Kotoko and Medeama were the teams that contested for the G6 tournament. Kotoko went on to beat Aduana Stars on penalties in the finals. Duncan's players swept four out of the five categories for the G6 awards. However, his reign at Kotoko ended on the 22nd June, 2016 following a mutual contract termination. = Coaching courses and qualifications = * Advanced National Diploma - USA, 2017 (equivalent to UEFA ‚ÄòA‚Äô) * CAF License 'A' 2012 * CAF License 'B' 2011 * National Diploma - USA, 2009 (equivalent to UEFA ‚ÄòB‚Äô) * UEFA Certificate, 2005 (As Trainer of Trainers for Youth Development - Cyprus * Coaching Attachment: FC Copenhagen, Esberg FC - Denmark, 2002.

The group formerly had around 2,000 men, but in May 2013 it clashed with Islamic fundamentalist groups and most of its fighters dispersed. Ghuraba al-Sham's arsenals were confiscated by the Islamists and by late 2013 it had only has around 100 fighters in its ranks. The group consisted of a mixture of secularists and Islamists. The name of the group has since changed. There was a battalion within the group called the Loyalty Battalion made up entirely of women. In November 2013, Hasan Jazra, the commander of Ghuraba al-Sham, was publicly executed by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the town of Atarib. Islamist groups had accused Ghuraba of looting and collaborating at times with the Syrian government. One of the group commanders, Nizar al-Khatib, also known by his nom de guerre \\"Abu Laith\\", formed the Descendants of Messengers Brigade after the dissolution of Ghuraba al-Sham, and continued to fight ISIL. In January and February 2014, the Descendants of Messengers Brigade forged an alliance with the Kurdish Front amid battles against ISIL in northern Aleppo, and in March 2014, it changed its name to the Dawn of Freedom Brigades. In April 2016 the German police arrested an unnamed 41 year old Syrian man accused of crimes against international law like torture and looting, committed while he was a leader of the group in 2012/2013.

The Strike One is known in Russia as the ¬´–°—Ç—Ä–∏–∂¬ª (\\"Strizh\\", Swift bird).http://modernfirearms.net/handguns/hg/rus/strike_one_pistol-e.html Development The AF-1 Strike One uses a Bergmann System introduced in the Bergmann‚ÄìBayard pistol. Unlike the Browning system, the barrel does not tilt. It is locked with a Y shaped part that during the recoil locks the barrel and bolt and halfway through it drops, releasing the barrel. The barrel stops its motion, the bolt continues back, ejecting the spent cartridge case and loading fresh cartridge and on its way back the Y shaped locking fork reengages and the barrel and bolt move together forward. Instead of tilting the barrel only moves in a straight line, thus increasing the accuracy. The Strike one is rated for +P+ ammunition and specifically set up to fire Russian 9√ó19mm ammunition 7N21 and 7N31 which are close to .357 SIG in their performance. The pistol will be available in: 9√ó19mm Parabellum, 9√ó21mm IMI, .357 SIG, and .40 S&W.; There is no discussion for 10mm Auto or .45 ACP versions, although a .38 Super version is being considered due to this cartridge's popularity in Italy in particular (Italian laws forbid civilians to have weapons in the same caliber as military and police). A fully automatic version of the Strike One has been offered for the Russian Armed Forces. Longer barreled version (300mm) is also available. The Strike One pistol features a low bore axis as the distance from the barrel central axis to the top of the grip is . Other 9√ó19mm Parabellum chambered service pistol designs have higher bore axes like the short recoil, locked breech, tilting barrel Caracal F , Glock 17 , Tanfoglio Force and Heckler & Koch USP Compact The short recoil, locked-breech Beretta 92 and short recoil and locked-breech, rotating barrel lock Beretta Px4 Compact designs both have a bore axis height. Stryk and Archon variants At SHOT Show in 2016, Arsenal Firearms announced that they would be partnering with Salient Arms International (SAI) and PRIME Ammunition in the newly formed Prime Manufacturing Group (PMG) to produce in the United States a redesigned version of the pistol known as the Stryk. This newer generation was initially announced to be manufactured and sold by SAI in the US as the Stryk-A full size (same dimensions as the former Strike One) and Stryk-B compact variants, at a lower cost and maintenance and an even greater profit margin. In 2018, due to a potential trademark dispute, Arsenal Firearms rebrands its US subsidiary Arsenal Firearms USA as Archon Firearms. On the American market, the STRYK-B is named the Archeon Type B. Concurrently, SAI still sells the remaining production of the original \\"Tier One\\" Strike One on the US market. Arsenal Firearms originally produced the AF1 Strike One in Italy. Newer STRYK-A of similar dimensions and the more compact STRYK-B (as well as the American variant, Archon Type B), are now manufactured by Swiss company RUAG in Germany and Hungary. STRYK-A/B and Archon Type B pistols feature Glock- compatible sights with a fiber optic on the front, upgraded gripping surfaces and ergonomics, a redesigned flat-faced and short reset trigger, a different slide profile and other modifications. The compact (B model) has a 15-round magazine.PMG: Stryk-A semiautomatic pistolSHOT 2016 Prime Manufacturing Group‚Äôs Stryk Pistols Gallery File:22_LR_Strizh- Strike_One_Moscow_International_Exhibition_ARMS_%26_Hunting_2013.jpg.22 LR Strizh-Strike One.

Lord Lisle's correspondence was seized by the state when he was arrested in May 1540 for treason and heresy, and as a result 515 letters written by Husee between 1533 and 1540 to Lord and Lady Lisle survive, mainly now preserved amongst the State Papers held at the National Archives.Byrne, 1981, vol.1, p.351: 398 in the 18 volumes of the \\"Lisle Papers\\" (held at the National Archives under SP.3, mainly in vols. 4,5,11 & 12; 116 in the State Papers of Henry VIII (SP.1); 1 uncalendared letter amongst the Cottonian Manuscripts at the British Museum (Byrne, vol.1, p.102, note 1)) They were transcribed into modern English and in 1981 published, together with all the other Lisle Papers, by Muriel St Clare Byrne in her six- volume work \\"The Lisle Letters\\". Origins Husee was the son of John Husee, a Southampton merchant, by his wife Elizabeth Holt, a daughter and co-heiress of John Holt of Hampshire. He had a brother who lived in London, but otherwise little is known of his family. Husee the elder traded principally in wine, and in 1500 he and several of his fellow merchants in Southampton were accused of corruption in the handling of the customs. The damage to his career was not lasting. He served as Sheriff of Southampton for a term in 1511‚Äì12. Shortly thereafter he moved to London, where in January 1516 he was admitted to the Worshipful Company of Vintners, and by November 1517 was one of the junior wardens of the company. In 1525 he was elected as one of the Chamberlains of the City of London. In 1528 he became Master of the Vintners. He was living in 1539, but nothing further is known of him. =Husee hearse-cloth= The Husee hearse-cloth, 1539, Company of Vintners, London A magnificent embroidered hearse-cloth (or coffin cover) given by John Husee senior to the Vintners Company on 14 February 1539Byrne, vol.1, p. 354: 1539; Vintner's Company website is still held by the company. It was used to cover the coffins of deceased prominent members, and was used for that purpose until 1931.

The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1981, vol.1, p.352. Date of gift of hearse-cloth stated by Byrne as 1539 Career Husee began his career as his father's apprentice in 1520, and was admitted as a freeman of the Vintners in June 1527. In February of that year he obtained royal letters of protection, and joined the retinue of the Governor of Calais, Sir Robert Wingfield. Map showing in 1477 the Pale of Calais (in yellow), where Husee spent much of his career In August 1533 Husee entered the service of the newly appointed Lord Deputy of Calais, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, an illegitimate son of Edward IV, and in his youth a close companion of Henry VIII. As Grummitt puts it, Husee 'quickly became Lisle's indispensable right-hand man', and 'the consummate Tudor servant'. He carried letters from Calais to England, and kept Lord Lisle informed of political events at court. Much of his time, particularly in the 1530s, was spent in England following Lord Lisle's suits at law. Husee was particularly adept at relations with those in the upper echelons of power, and even at times offered Lord Lisle advice on dealing with King Henry VIII, who evidently liked him. Husee performed more mundane tasks for the Lord Deputy and his family as well, seeing to the care of Lady Lisle's children by her first marriage when they were in England, finding suitable servants, and purchasing goods in London. Husee was compensated for his services with a post in the Calais garrison which by 1535 provided him with a daily wage of 8d. In October 1536 he received a grant for life from the Crown as 'searcher of the lordships of Marke and Oye within the Calais pale', which brought him an additional 8d a day. The holding of the office of Lord Deputy entailed considerable expense, and Lisle wished to give up the post and return to England. Husee made frequent overtures to Cromwell to obtain funds to cover Lisle's expenses, and to obtain leave for Lisle and his family to return home. However, according to Grummitt, Cromwell would not agree until he had secured for himself Lisle's manor of Painswick in Gloucestershire. Lisle conveyed the manor to Cromwell in 1539, who sold it the following year to Sir William Kingston and his wife, Mary.'Painswick: Manors and other estates', A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 11: Bisley and Longtree Hundreds (1976), pp. 65-70 Retrieved 27 June 2013. Husee's service to the Lisles was brought to an end by Lord Lisle's arrest on treason charges on 19 May 1540. Lisle was accused of communicating with Cardinal Reginald Pole, and spent the next two years in the Tower of London. After his master's ruin, Husee continued to hold his position in the Calais garrison, and in that capacity took part in 1544 in the English siege of Boulogne. Little is known of Husee's private life. There is no evidence that he married. He died at Calais in November 1548. The Lisle Papers are held by the National Archives.Lisle Papers, National Archives Retrieved 27 June 2103. They were published as the Lisle Letters in 1981. Husee is 'the most fully documented of all the writers of this correspondence. His letters are a joy and a revelation to read. He was completely loyal to the Lisles, a friend as much as an agent, and a very wise one in the appalling world of the Tudor court'.Plumb, J.H., 'Henry VIII Was The Man To See', New York Times, 14 June 1981 Retrieved 27 June 2013.

The foundation emphasizes it has an evidence-based, non-partisan approach to research. The foundation focuses on research and convening stakeholders to improve the prosperity, sustainability and quality of life for the citizens of Canada's four western provinces, and to educate Canadians on western Canadian contributions and aspirations.  Three Research Centres  =Natural Resources, Trade & Investment, Human Capital= After a deep program review in 2012-13, the foundation decided to focus on three key areas of research: human capital, natural resources and trade and investment. In 2013, the Foundation established three new research centres:CanadaWestFoundatiorelaunchesCalgaryHerald18october2013 the Natural Resources Centre, the Trade & Investment Centre and the Human Capital Centre. Through its three centres, it looks for practical solutions to the challenges that face western Canada, including getting products to markets around the world; building a stronger, more versatile workforce; and finding ways to build public support for the region's key natural resource industries: forestry, agri-food, mining, and oil and natural gas. History The Canada West Foundation was founded Dec. 31, 1970. Founding members include George Maxwell Bell (1912-1972), Arthur Child (1910-1996),Arthur Child, a staunch Reform Party supporter, was president and CEO for Burns Foods, brought it from the verge of bankruptcy to becoming the second-largest meat packer in the country. Child was author of Economics and Politics in US Banking(1965). Frederick C. Mannix (1913-) and Honourable James A. Richardson. The idea of a western-focused thinking tank emerged during the One Prairie Province? A Question for Canada Conference, co-sponsored by the University of Lethbridge and the Lethbridge Herald in Lethbridge, Alberta, on May 10‚Äì13, 1970. Three papers were presented, including Strayer's paper on the Constitutional processes for a Prairie union. David Elton political science at the University of Lethbridge. published the conference proceedings in 1970 in the Lethbridge Herald.. Elton replaced Stan Roberts as president in 1980. He remained in that position until 1997 where he researched such topics as institutional reform and citizens' engagement. In this capacity he acted as witness in federal parliamentary committees on Finance advocating for zero deficit and cut-off income limits for social welfare funding. Stan Roberts was president of the Canada West Foundation from 1976 to 1980. In this capacity, he took a leading role in arguing for the position of the west in Canada's constitutional debates. In 1987 Francis Winspear,Francis G. Winspear (1903-1997) was a wealthy Edmonton financier and philanthropist who retired in Vancouver. Biography. financed the Western Assembly on Canada's Economic and Political Future, (Patten 1997:40) organized by Preston Manning, Stan Roberts and Robert Muirheld and promoted by Ted Byfield, in Vancouver in 1987. Organizational support was provided by the Canada West Foundation. It was at this assembly that the Reform Party of Canada was launched.Ellis worked with Tom Flanagan conducting research for the Reform Party which eventually led to his dissertation. Roger Gibbins recruited Ellis into the Ph.D. program in political science at the University of Calgary.In a meteoric rise, almost unprecedented in the history of Canada, the Reform Party became the Official Opposition to the Government of Canada within 10 years. Winspear who was convinced that \\"mainline political parties no longer served the interest of Canadians,\\" played a crucial role in the \\"founding and sustaining of the Reform Party of Canada.\\" There were some within the Canada West Foundation who believed that Roberts himself was partly sympathetic to separatism; he never became affiliated with the movement, but was forced to step down as CWF President in December 1980 after some controversial statements on the subject. According to journalist, Norm Ovenden, under Roberts' presidency, by 1980, the Canada West Foundation had become a \\"powerhouse\\", a \\"prestige organization in just a decade.\\" Ovenden credits Roberts with transforming a \\"low-key research organization\\" into a \\"well-known, widely respected pulse-takers of the Canadian west\\" in four years. James K. Gray O.C., A.O.E., co-founder of Canadian Hunter Exploration, \\"one of Canada's largest and most successful natural gas companies.\\" served as chair of the Canada West Foundation from 1994 to 2009 and as honorary chair. Roger Gibbins, chairman and head of the political science department at the University of Calgary, served as president and CEO of the Canada West Foundation from 1999 until his retirement in June 2012. Gibbins was also a member of the Calgary School.Although the Calgary school is not an official organization and has no membership list, Roger Gibbins, David Bercuson, history professor and director of the university's Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, Barry F. Cooper, political science professor and fellow of the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute, Tom Flanagan, professor of political science, senior fellow at the Fraser Institute and former adviser to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Rainer Knopff, political science professor and Ted Morton were included in the group in a 2004 article in The Walrus. Dylan Jones was President and CEO of the Foundation, from June 2012 to May 2016. Jones was former Deputy Minister to Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall. Jones was named Deputy Minister of Western Economic Diversification, effective June 20, 2016. In September 2016, Martha Hall Findlay was named President and CEO of the Foundation. Funding The Foundation is a registered educational charity, funded through donations from charitable foundations, government, industry stakeholders and individual citizens. It also conducts research on behalf of clients. The Foundation has a reserve fund, from which it draws annual income. Senate Reform In late 1978, CWF President, Stan Roberts, expressed interest in Francis Winspear's proposed constitutional reforms, which included Senate reform and the equal treatment of all provinces. During this period, Roberts made several speeches warning about the possibility of western separatism. The four western provinces were vastly under-represented in Senate. In 2012 Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Albert and British Columbia has only six seats each in the 105-seat Senate chamber. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Newfoundland, despite much smaller populations than the West, had a combined 30 seats. Ontario and Quebec each had 24 seat. The CWF promotes a Triple-E Senate that would be equal, elected, and effective.page 9 However, with Prime Minister Harper in power, \\"the West no longer wants in because it is in. Indeed, it occupies the Prime Minister's Office.\\" Western Cities Project In 2000 the CWF published a report entitled A Roof Over Our Heads: Affordable Housing and Urban Growth in Western Canada. In 2008 the research was updated in a publication entitled Affordable Housing and Homelessness Policy in Canada funded by the Alberta Real Estate Foundation, the Urban Development Institute Alberta and the cities of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Regina.

The fort, a lunette fortification, stood on the southwest side of the town next to the harbor, on a bluff overlooking the Amelia River. It was made of wood and earthworks, backed with a wooden palisade on the east side, and armed with an eight or ten gun battery. Two blockhouses protected access by land on the south, while the village was surrounded with military pickets. An 1821 map of Fernandina shows that the street plan, laid out in 1811 in a grid pattern by the newly appointed Surveyor General of Spanish East Florida, George J. F. Clarke, today preserves nearly the same layout as that of 1821. The fort occupied the area bounded by the streets Calle de Estrada, Calle de White, and Calle de Someruelos. The structure itself has disappeared and only traces remain in what is now Fernandina Plaza Historic State Park. The park contains the largest known undeveloped portion of the site of Spanish municipal and military activity on Amelia Island dating from the late 1780s. Archaeological investigations, starting in the early 1950s, revealed intermittent occupation and use of the area for as long as 4,000 years, beginning in the Orange period (2000‚Äì500 BC) and continuing to this day. A Spanish sentinel house was built in 1696 at the Timuqua village located there. Nearly all of Old Town was built on this Indian village and its shell heaps. In later colonial times the site gained military importance because of its deep harbor and its strategic location near the northern boundary of Spanish Florida.  History  Plan of Amelia Island. 1770 (1777) The history of Fort San Carlos is intimately connected with the development of the Fernandina Plaza, also called the Town Lot, first defined in 1769 when a town site which included the lot was shown in charts drawn by Capt. John Fuller and then mapped by cartographer Thomas Jefferys in 1770. As late as 1777, however, there were no indications of any town development. The place had stood uninhabited, except for occasional encampments of English colonial invaders, since the raids in 1702 by Colonel James Moore, governor of South Carolina. Prior to the British evacuation of East Florida when it was returned to Spanish rule, Maria Mattair, n√©e Green (1755‚Äì1820), the widow of Lewis Mattair (1751‚Äì1783), had received a grant from Governor Tonyn for 200 acres along this bluff overlooking the Amelia River. Amelia Island was virtually depopulated after raids by American patriots in the mid-1770s. Mary Mattair and her family were the only occupants known to remain on the island following the evacuation. Amelia River, viewed from Old Town site Maria Mattair owned the Town Lot and surroundings from 1784 until 1788, when the Spanish colonial government assumed possession after a land exchange. In June 1795, American rebel marauders led by Richard Lang attacked the Spanish garrison on Amelia Island. Colonel Charles Howard, an officer in the Spanish military, discovered that the rebels had built a battery and were flying the French flag. On August 2, he raised a sizable Spanish force, sailed up Sisters Creek and the Nassau River, and attacked them. The rebels fled across the St. Marys River to Georgia. The town lot or plaza was an essential element of the Spanish colonial town plan. Government offices were designed to face the plaza, and in the case of this coastal village, the plaza could be fortified as a defensive work. An army encampment was recorded in the Plaza Lot in 1801, and a small wooden fort, including a battery of three cannon, was established from then until 1814. The more substantial Fort San Carlos was built about 1816 to protect the strategic harbor of the Amelia River and Spanish interests in northern Florida. The former Indian campsite became the fort‚Äôs parade grounds fronting Estrada Street, which still exists. = Fernandina Township platted according to the Laws of the Indies = Plat of Fernandina from 1811 until 1821, showing location of Fort San Carlos, drawn by Franz Dollheimer in April 1937 On May 10, 1811, the acting Spanish governor at the time, Juan Jos√© Estrada, instructed the newly appointed public surveyor, George J. F. Clarke, to plat the township in accordance with the 1542 Spanish Laws of the Indies (Leyes de Indias). These laws regulated how the site for a Spanish settlement should be selected, and how the town should be laid out in classical grid form. Places were designated for the fort and its parade ground. The town stood on the high ground behind the imposing bluff facing the Amelia River. This location was on a wide peninsula with a relatively narrow isthmus at the southeast, the road to the rest of Amelia Island entering the town through the gates at that point. Egan's Creek and saltmarsh bounded the north and east sides, while another marsh stretched south of the town. From marsh to marsh across the neck of dry land there was a strong picket with a small blockhouse mounting two 4-pounder cannons that guarded the entrance. Another blockhouse flanking the town mounted one 4-pounder. Fort San Carlos commanded the anchorage of the Amelia River to the west as far as the channel of the St. Marys River; it mounted four long Spanish 16-pounders, five 4-pounders, and one 6-pound carronade. = The Patriots' War = East Florida Patriot Flag Because it was a center for smuggling and represented a threat to trade of the United States, Fernandina was invaded and seized by forces under the command of General George Mathews in 1812 with the approval of President James Madison. A group of Americans calling themselves the \\"Patriots of Amelia Island\\" had banded together to drive out the Spanish and reported to General Mathews, who moved into a house at St. Marys, Georgia, nine miles across Cumberland Sound. On March 16, nine American gunboats under the command of Commodore Hugh Campbell formed a line in the harbor and aimed their guns at the town.Congressional edition 1858, p.45 General Mathews, who was ensconced at Point Peter on the St. Marys in Georgia, ordered Colonel Lodowick Ashley to send a flag to Don Justo Lopez, commandant of the fort and Amelia Island, and demand his surrender. Lopez acknowledged the superior force and surrendered the Port of Fernandina and the town. John H. McIntosh, George J. F. Clarke, Justo Lopez, and others signed the articles of capitulation;Williams 1837, p. 195 the Patriots then raised their own standard at the flagstaff of the fort. The next day, March 17, a detachment of 250 regular United States troops were brought over from Point Peter, and the newly constituted Patriot government surrendered the town to General Matthews, who ordered the stars and stripes of the US flag raised immediately. General Mathews and President Madison had conceived a plan to annex East Florida to the United States, but Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain, and the effort fell apart when Secretary of State James Monroe was forced to relieve Matthews of his commission. Negotiations for the withdrawal of US troops began early in 1813. On May 6, the US army lowered the flag at Fernandina and crossed the St. Marys River to Georgia with the remaining troops. Spain took possession of the redoubt and regained control of the island. The Spanish completed construction of the new Fort San Carlos to guard the port side of Fernandina in 1816. = Gregor MacGregor and the Republic of the Floridas = General Gregor MacGregor As the Spanish Empire disintegrated, Fernandina became increasingly vulnerable to foreign depredations. The small garrison at Fernandina had only fifty-four men on duty including officers, most of them old veterans, some of whom had served in the Spanish colonial armies for thirty years. The town had less than two hundred residents, no more than fifty of them able to bear arms in the militia. There was a lawless atmosphere in Fernandina when Gregor MacGregor appeared on the scene. A Scottish military adventurer and mercenary, MacGregor claimed to be commissioned by representatives of the revolting Venezuela and New Granada to liberate Florida from Spanish rule. Financed by American backers, he led an army of only 150 men including recruits from Charleston and Savannah, some War of 1812 veterans, and 55 musketeers in an assault on Fort San Carlos. Through spies within the Spanish garrison, MacGregor had learned that the force there consisted of only 54 regulars and 50 militia men. He spread rumors in the town which eventually reached the garrison commander that an army of more than 1,000 men was about to attack. MacGregor and his men assaulted Fort San Carlos on June 29, 1817, advancing on the fort from the north, and deployed in small groups coming from various directions across Egans Creek to give the impression of a larger force.Owsley 1997, p.127 The commander, Francisco Morales, struck the Spanish flag and fled.Writers' Program (Fla.) 1940, p.27 MacGregor raised his flag, the \\"Green Cross of Florida\\", a green cross on a white ground, over the fort and proclaimed the \\"Republic of the Floridas\\". Green Cross Flag of Republic of the Floridas Now in possession of the town, and seeing the need to make the appearance of a legitimate government, he appointed Ruggles Hubbard, the former high sheriff of New York City, as unofficial civil governor, and Jared Irwin, an adventurer and former Pennsylvania Congressman, as his treasurer. Expecting reinforcements for a raid against the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, MacGregor intended to subdue all of Spanish East Florida.\\"Great Britain 1837\\", p.763 His plan was doomed to fail, however, as President James Monroe was in sensitive negotiations with Spain to acquire all of Florida.Niles 1818, p. 303 Soon MacGregor's reserves were depleted, and the Republic needed revenue. He commissioned privateers to seize Spanish ships,Great Britain 1837, p.769 and they began selling captured prizes and their cargoes, which often included slaves. When about August 28 fellow conspirator Ruggles Hubbard sailed into the harbor aboard his own brig Morgiana, flying the flag of Buenos Aires, but without the needed men, guns, and money, MacGregor announced his departure for New Providence in the Bahamas. On September 4, faced with the threat of a Spanish reprisal, and still lacking money and adequate reinforcements, he abandoned his plans to conquer Florida and departed Fernandina with most of his officers, leaving a small detachment of men at Fort San Carlos to defend the island. After his withdrawal, these and a force of American irregulars organized by Hubbard and Irwin repelled the Spanish attempt to reassert authority. = The Battle of Amelia Island = On September 13 the Battle of Amelia Island commenced when the Spaniards erected a battery of four brass cannons on McLure‚Äôs Hill east of Fort San Carlos. With about 300 men, supported by two gunboats, they shelled Fernandina being held by Jared Irwin. His \\"Republic of Florida\\" forces included ninety-four men, the privateer ships Morgiana and St. Joseph, and the armed schooner Jupiter. Spanish gunboats began firing at 3:30 pm and the battery on the hill joined the cannonade. The guns of Fort San Carlos, on the river bluff northwest of the hill, and those of the St. Joseph defended Amelia Island. Cannonballs killed two and wounded other Spanish troops clustered below. Firing continued until dark. The Spanish commander, convinced he could not capture the island, then withdrew his forces.CokerShofner 1991, p. 7Owsley.1997, p. 134 = The French Corsair Luis Aury = Mexican insurgents' flag flown by privateer Louis Aury On September 17, the French privateer Luis Aury, a previous acquaintance of MacGregor's who had served with him in Simon Bol√≠var's army in Venezuela and New Granada,Adams 1875, p. 75 sailed into the Port of Fernandina aboard his flagship, Mexican Congress, accompanied by two other privateering ships and holding prizes valued at $60,000. His ship mounted 12 long 18-pounders and had a crew of 300 American recruits and Haitian ex-slaves, free blacks, and mulattoes known as \\"Aury's blacks\\".Landers 2010, p. 134 Aury marched to Hubbard‚Äôs quarters with a body of armed men and demanded concessions from Hubbard and Irwin, who were short of troops and funds. They appealed for financial aid, but Aury refused, unless he have supreme command of both civil and military government. When Hubbard and Irwin protested his terms, Aury threatened to leave the island. Realizing they had nothing to gain by opposing him, a compromise was reached and they made an alliance with the Frenchman:Niles 1818, p.302 Aury would be commander-in-chief of military and naval forces, Irwin his adjutant general, and Hubbard the civil governor of Amelia.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.138. The flag of the revolutionary Republic of Mexico was raised over Fort San Carlos on September 21, 1817, and thus Amelia Island was dubiously annexed to the Republic of Mexico.State papers, 1819, p.401 Aury created an administrative body called the \\"Supreme Council of the Floridas\\", directed his secretaries Pedro Gual Escand√≥n and Vicente Pazos Kanki to draw up a constitution, and invited all Florida people to unite in throwing off the Spanish yoke. = Adams-Onis Treaty transfers Florida and Fort San Carlos to the United States = Proclamation for general election of legislature of the Republic of the Floridas The new government of Fernandina was short-lived. According to Lloyd's of London, Aury's commissioned privateers captured more than $500,000 worth of Spanish goods in two months. They preyed on Spanish vessels carrying slaves, most of whom were smuggled into Georgia after being captured.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.139 These activities threatened the negotiations concerning the cession of Florida and in response President Monroe sent forces to retake Amelia on October 31. After a contentious exchange of communications with representatives of the president,Niles 1818, p.347‚Äì352 Aury realized his position was untenable and surrendered the island and the fort to Commodore J.D. Henley and Major James Bankhead on December 23, 1817.British and Foreign State Papers 1837, p.773 Aury remained over two months as an unwelcome guest; Bankhead occupied Fernandina and held it \\"in trust\\" for Spain.Congressional edition 1818, p.7 [47] Although angered by US interference at Fort San Carlos, Spain did cede Florida in 1821. The proclamation of the Adams-Onis Treaty on February 22, 1821, two years after its signing, officially transferred East Florida and what remained of West Florida to the United States. The US Army made little use of the fort and soon abandoned it. = Decline of Old Town and Fort San Carlos = Fernandina, the one-time smugglers' den and freebooter haven, subsequently faded into quiet obscurity, although the local militia of the Confederate Army occupied Fort San Carlos during the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), and the US military is known to have used it briefly during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898). Archaeologists estimate that two-thirds of the area formerly occupied by the fort has disappeared through erosion by the Amelia River. Today, most of the Town Lot is contained within Fernandina Plaza Historic State Park, an unfenced grassy area, marked by a State of Florida Historic Marker. Fernandina Plaza Historic State Park occurs at an elevation of approximately three meters above sea level; the terrain is essentially flat. The original topography has undoubtedly changed as a result of human occupation and the construction of Fort San Carlos, but the original Spanish town plan and regular street grid, with many of the Spanish street names, remain. Traces of the earthworks and the former parade grounds can be found along Estrada Street. In 1950‚Äì51, John W. Griffin and Ripley P. Bullen, the archaeologists for the Florida Board of Parks and Historical Memorials, led extensive archaeological excavations in the Fort San Carlos area. The Florida State University Department of Anthropology, under the direction of Hale G. Smith, conducted a field archaeology techniques course at the fort during the spring of 1963. A report compiled by Smith and Bullen, \\"Fort San Carlos\\", synthesizing the results of both excavations, was published by the Department of Anthropology at Florida State University in 1971. The field notes and profile drawings of the 1951 excavations were lost; however, the work in 1963 re-excavated most of the areas covered in 1951 by Griffin and Bullen. The 1963 field session was held at Fort San Carlos at the request of the Duncan Lamont Clinch Historical Society of Amelia Island. The Historical Society was interested in having archaeological work done on the fort site so that it might be reconstructed in the future.

The single track line follows the valley of the River Doe Lea for much of its route. Construction The branch was constructed from north to south in three stages over 27 years. * The Midland Railway Additional Powers Act of 21 July 1863 authorised the company to build a line from a junction near Seymour Colliery, near Staveley, approximately to Bolsover Woodhouse in the Doe Lea Valley.  The junction near Seymour became known as Seymour Junction.[ Seymour Junction by map and satellite]  This line opened for traffic on 1 May 1866. The only apparent source of this traffic is Markham No.1 Colliery, evidence confirming this has yet to be found. * The Midland Railway Additional Powers Act of 28 July 1873 authorised the company to build the \\"Doe Lea Extension\\" southwards to the west of the Doe Lea to the parish of Ault Hucknall, terminating \\"in a field called Horse Close\\".  Within eighteen months the company changed its mind and wished to build this extension slightly longer and to the east of the river. This alteration was authorised by the Midland Railway Additional Powers Act of 29 June 1875, which included the requirement that the company restore for cultivation any land abandoned by the deviation.  Buying the necessary land was so time-consuming the company had to seek an extension, which was granted by the Midland Railway Additional Powers Act of 17 July 1878.  The Doe Lea Extension Deviation was opened to Glapwell on 1 September 1886 (thirteen years after authorisation) for goods traffic and workmen's trains.  Glapwell colliery opened in 1882 and progress was made towards opening Bolsover colliery, where sinking would eventually begin in 1890; both of these would give a return on the investment.  Workmen's services were provided calling at all collieries between Staveley and Glapwell. * The Midland Railway Additional Powers Act of 16 July 1883 authorised the company to  build the \\"Doe Lea and Teversall Junction Railway\\" from the Doe Lea Extension Deviation (in construction) to a junction which became known as Pleasley Colliery West Junction[ Pleasley Colliery West Junction by map and satellite] a short distance south of the future station, and  bring the whole route up to passenger-carrying standards. * The first two sections had been easy to build along the gently sloping bottom of the Doe Lea Valley, the only section with any gradient being the approach to Glapwell from the north. This third and final section was a very different matter, it involved boring the only tunnel on the whole route and the only significant gradients, notably long sections at 1 in 50. Time and costs overran significantly with contractors experiencing landslips and wet ground which involved among other things having to extend Rowthorn Tunnel beyond original estimates. * The route as a whole was opened to passenger traffic on 1 September 1890. * Later additions occurred with the opening of Bolsover Collieries, Ramcroft Colliery during WW1, Markham No.2 Colliery, Byron Bricks siding and Coalite at Bolsover. Passenger services Initially there were only three stations on the branch - Bolsover (later renamed Bolsover Castle), and . Bolsover station was down a long hill from Bolsover, Palterton and Sutton was midway between both small villages, but near neither, and Rowthorn remains a small village to this day, though it has acquired a \\"e\\" as Rowthorne. Glapwell colliery had brought people to live and work, but was not provided with a station other than a collier's platform at the pit. As a result of local campaigning a station was built at and opened on 1 September 1892. The initial service was three trains each weekday calling at all stations between and (then called Staveley\\"), one of which went through via to , with an extra Mansfield to Barrow Hill and return on Saturdays. there never was a Sunday service on the branch. This sinuous journey took about an hour from end to end. By 1922 little had changed to timing or pattern, except there were now two extra trains on Saturdays and most of the trains ran through to Chesterfield. In 1930, the final year of passenger services, there were still three a day, each way, with an extra on Saturdays but only one Saturday train ran to and from Chesterfield. The service was withdrawn on 28 July 1930. Although the local service was withdrawn, Bolsover station proved to be a remarkable survivor, bringing passenger trains to part of the branch for a further 50 years. An unadvertised service continued to call until 14 August 1931 and pre-war excursions continued until at least 27 July 1939. Records show that a half-day excursion service called at Bolsover on 26 July 1949 on its way to and . The last steam train to use the line was an enthusiasts' special on 16 October 1965. This train also traversed the Clowne Branch. Occasional specials continued to call at the station. One such was run to Chesterfield in connection with the Queen's Jubilee celebrations in Queen's Park, Chesterfield on 28 July 1977. This had been on the initiative of the headmaster of Bolsover Church of England Junior School as there were insufficient buses to take all the children to the event. Thereafter, there were yearly August excursions from 1978 until 1981 organised by Bolsover Miners' Welfare when trains of at least nine coaches ran to Scarborough. Another source claims that the last charter from Bolsover Castle was a nine- coach train to via Chesterfield on 15 November 1980 organised by Bolsover Secondary School PTA. Run down The decline of the branch was a case of last in - first out. When the line closed to local passenger traffic in 1930 Glapwell Colliery was still going strong. As its sidings left the passenger line north of Glapwell station and all coal went out northwards, the station was abandoned along with the track southwards through Rowthorn Tunnel almost to Pleasley Colliery West Junction, leaving a short length there as a siding. The abandoned section had been difficult and expensive to work and was simply redundant. After closure the tunnel found two new uses, first as a mushroom farm then, during WW2, as an ammunition store. It has since been filled in. This left the earliest two sections ‚Äì the Doe Lea line and the Doe Lea extension deviation ‚Äì running as a dead-end branch from Seymour Junction to Glapwell Colliery. Unofficially at least, the branch became called the Glapwell Branch for a generation of railwaymen, as for the next 44 years that was its terminus. Until the advent of British Rail Class 20 diesels in the early 1960s the characteristic motive power along the branch were the ubiquitous Midland 3F and LMS 4F 0-6-0s hauling the dominant traffic ‚Äì coal. Coal from Glapwell, Ramcroft, Bolsover and Markham, with a small amount of traffic from Coalite and a smaller amount from Byron Bricks. The line's leisurely routine was interrupted for a few days in August 1952 when the ex- LD&ECR; Doe Lea Viaduct, which straddled the Doe Lea Branch a short distance south of Bolsover Castle station, was demolished by the army using explosives.Doe Lea Viaduct via oldminer This was filmed and the film later used in a commercial war film, becoming a bridge in war torn France. Ramcroft Colliery closed in 1966 and Glapwell followed in 1974, rendering the line south of Bolsover redundant, though it was not lifted until 1978. Bolsover and Markham Collieries closed in the 1990s and Coalite finally went into receivership in 2004, but it had not provided much traffic for some time. This left the remaining stub from Seymour Junction to Bolsover Castle station (only slightly longer than the original 1866 Doe Lea line to Bolsover Woodhouse) intact but redundant. By now, unofficially at least, the branch became called the Bolsover Branch. At 2011, apart from predation by thieves and vandals, it was intact, but overgrown. Trackbed uses The branch between Bolsover Castle and the bottom of Rylah Hill between Palterton and M1 J29 is now a public bridleway known as The Stockley Trail. Glapwell Colliery and all associated tracks have been buried under landscaping of the former pit tip. Parts of the trackbed in the vicinity of and those of neighbouring lines have been turned into public footpaths and bridleways.Rowthorne Trail: via Derbyshire County CouncilTeversal and Pleasley Trails: via cycletrails Possible future The line from Foxlow Junction through Hall Lane Junction to Seymour Junction and Oxcroft Disposal Point off the Clowne Branch has been mothballed as there remains the possibility of opencasting in the area. For example, in 2005 UK Coal (now Coalfield Resources), expressed an interest in extracting c530,000 tons near Mastin Moor. The Doe Lea line south from Seymour Junction to Bolsover has been mothballed as it runs through the new Markham Vale Enterprise Zone at M1 Junction 29A. It was originally hoped that someone would invest in this infrastructure to create road-rail interchange facilities, however several studies have appraised the cost benefit of this link, and it seems unlikely to progress. A more likely alternative seems to be the extension of the Stockley Trail Greenway along the original track bed, and through the redeveloped Coalite site, connecting into the Markham Vale Scheme and affording a near direct link to the Trans Pennine Trail through Poolsbrook Country Park The Clowne Branch was purchased in 2016 by Derbyshire County Council and is planned to be developed into a full Greenway all the way to the east and to provide a sustainable transport link with Creswell Rail Station. Although this disused line has not yet been fully cleared and surfaced to Greenway standards, several volunteer groups keep it accessible to foot or cycle traffic as an interim measure The Doe Lea Valley is planned to become part of the route of the north eastern arm of HS2.

Young and energetic, from 1813 he sought to bring order to Trinidad society and greatly improved the public infrastructure, especially in Port of Spain. At the same time, he institutionalised class and racial divisions and was not in favour of emancipation. His governorship was cut short by his death at sea.  Early life  Ralph James Woodford, born in 1784, was the son of the 1st Baronet of Carleby, the diplomat Sir Ralph Woodford, and Gertrude Reessen, of Dutch extraction. Between 1809 and 1811 Woodford was in Madeira, caring for his invalid sister, Elizabeth. Their parents both died in 1810 and on his return he sought an appointment.  Governor of Trinidad  After declining the offer of the new post of Registrar of Slaves in Trinidad, Woodford secured the governorship of Trinidad under the patronage of Lord Bathurst, then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. Appointed on 31 October 1812, he succeeded Hector William Munro on 14 June 1813 on his arrival in Port of Spain. Much of the capital had been destroyed in a major fire in 1808, and under Woodford's direction much of what is now the old centre of Port of Spain was redeveloped. In view of the recent fire, only stone buildings were permitted. Land was reclaimed to provide the first proper wharfage giving access to trading ships. He arranged the purchase of an abandoned sugar estate and laid it out as The Savannah for the people's recreation and as a cattle pasture. Purchasing also the nearby Hollandais Estate as his residence, he also established there botanical gardens and had ornamental trees planted in the town's main squares (including Brunswick Square, renamed Woodford Square in his honour). He had the streets paved, Both of the current cathedrals in Port of Spain have their origins in the churches he had built for the Anglican and Roman Catholic communities. In all, he oversaw the development of Port of Spain into an attractive town; in the words of Henry Coleridge in 1825: ::\\"Port of Spain is by far the finest town I saw in the West Indies. The streets are wide, long, and laid out at right angles; no house is now allowed to be built of wood, and no erection of any sort can be made except in a prescribed line. There is a public walk embowered in trees (...), and a spacious market place with a market house or shambles in excellent order and cleanliness.\\" Supervising many of the works personally, protected from the sun and on his horse; he became popularly known among the creole as \\"gouverneur chapeau paille\\" (Governor straw hat). In addition to the paving of roads, Woodford introduced steam navigation to link Port of Spain with San Fernando and other settlements around the island. In 1818 the 71-foot wood-hulled Woodford was built by William Denny at Dumbarton, Scotland, and was the first paddle steamer operating in Caribbean waters. In addition to public works, he was strongly motivated to promote the civic good, not only supporting the development of both the Roman Catholic and Protestant communities, but bringing all schools under Government supervision with a code of \\"Rules for Schools\\". Woodford was personally against the abolition of slavery, and tended to favour the sugar planters with regard to emancipation when disputes came before him. Underlying much of his social policy was a desire to bring order to this new Brish colony, but based on a strong class structure. He was particularly concerned about the position of free blacks and whose freedoms pre-dating British control he sought to restrict, for example by seeking to prevent marriages between white and black (unlike some of his predecessors, he did not keep a black mistress). In contrast to his attitude to slaves and free blacks, he was supportive of the indigenous Amerindians and encouraged their ethnic pride and the revival of their festivals, especially around the town of Arima.

It was based on pre-war Datsun designs, themselves closely based on the Austin Seven. A more luxurious range with the same underpinnings, called the DB series, was sold in parallel. __TOC__  Datsun DS The Datsun DS (Datsun DS-1) was introduced in late 1949 or 1950 as the replacement for the Datsun DA. It was essentially a DA, but with more comfortable bodywork and a chrome grille similar to that of the Datsun 17T truck except the center strip was chromed instead of painted. The same engine was used, producing . The DS was in production until August 1950, after which it was replaced by the Datsun DS-2. Datsun DS-2 The Datsun DS-2 was released in August 1950 and was completely redesigned with modern styling (the front end resembled a scaled- down Willys Jeep). The DS-2 was based on the Datsun 5147 truck and the drivetrain was the same new 860 cc engine as used in the DB-2. The DS-2 and later DS models were marketed as a less expensive (and basic) alternative to the more upscale DB. The DS-2 was known in Japan as the \\"Square Dandy\\" thanks to its square and boxy Jeeplike styling; the DS-2 was replaced by the Datsun DS-4 in August 1951, although at least one remaining DS-2 is referred to as a \\"1952\\". Datsun DS-4 The Datsun DS-4 (the DS-3 designation was skipped) was released in August 1951 and was the first four-door car (along with the DB-4) to have the Datsun name. The styling was a nightmare (it looked like five different cars put together). The drivetrain carried over from the DS-2, although the chassis was lengthened to enable a larger passenger compartment. The front doors were rear-hinged while the rear doors were front-hinged. The front end was similar to the DS-2 but with a different grille; the front of the hood spelled out \\"DATSUN\\" in individual chrome letters. The DS-4 was in production until early 1953, when it was replaced by the Datsun DS-5. Datsun DS-5 The Datsun DS-5 was released in 1953 and was largely the same as the DS-4, with a new grille design and with the engine upgraded to produce . The DS-5 was in production until 1954, when it was replaced by the completely redesigned Datsun DS-6. Datsun DS-6 The Datsun DS-6 Convar was released in July 1954 and was more modern and attractive compared to the DS-4 and DS-5. The DS-6 was based on the DS-5 and used its drivetrain. The front-end was unique with a flat panel (with \\"DATSUN\\" in individual letters) between the hood opening and the grille, which was oval-shaped that was split by the bumper bar. The trunk lid lifted up rather than folded down. The DS-6 was only in production until the end of the year, when it was replaced by the all new Datsun 110 which went on sale in January 1955.

These caves belong to first century B.C. It has two chaityas, two stupas and the rest are viharas. These caves are some of the most ancient rock-cut caves not only in Maharashtra but in all India and were located at a complex site of the ancient trade route of Chaul. The earliest caves were probably excavated between 70 and 50 BC, according to paleographic evidence. In 1891 Henry Cousens wrote, \\"From Nadsur it is a stiff climb and long walk to the caves, which are excavated in the side of a spur of the Ghats two miles to the east of the village... The caves are cut in a long line of trap cliff which faces nearly west, and are eighteen in number, the more important among them being the third, seventh, eighth, and fifteenth from the south end...The interior of many of the caves have been greatly damaged...the facade of almost every cave has disappeared.\\" Cave No 7 is the most beautiful and largest among all caves in the group. The whole of the wall of Cave No 7 is decorated with Buddhist Rail, Arch, and other mouldings with figures of men, women and animals. About it, Cousens wrote: \\"No. 7 is the most important cave in the whole group, and it also the largest...Around the three sides of this cave are cells with a bench in each, and each is provided with a small lattice window. In the south wall are three cells, in the west or back wall four, and in the north wall one. Around the three sides of the cave, and before the cell doorway, runs a low bench...The whole of the back wall, with parts of the north and south wall, are decorated with the Buddhist rail, arch, and other mouldings, with figures of men, women and animals. Shallow niches alternate with the cells doors along the walls, and each of the former is surmounted by the chaitya arch, with an imitation of wooden ribbing under its soffit...\\" The caves have two notable inscriptions, showing the names of donors. These Ancient rock-cut Buddhist caves are located in a beautiful mountainous site. The most frequently used path starts in Thanale village and goes through dense forest, along waterfalls and mountain scenery. These caves are also approachable from Village Nadsur, hence these are also referred to as Nadsur Caves. Exact GPS location is available on Google Maps and the walking trail from Thanale Village to the cave is also marked on Google Maps. Apart from this the Pune Trekkers Group has painted arrow marks along the walking trail. These caves are on the list of Protected Monuments of Archaeological Survey of India.

If it does in fact exist, nuclear pasta is the strongest material in the universe. Between the surface of a neutron star and the quark‚Äìgluon plasma at the core, at matter densities of 1014 g/cm3, nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion forces are of similar magnitude. The competition between the forces leads to the formation of a variety of complex structures assembled from neutrons and protons. Astrophysicists call these types of structures nuclear pasta because the geometry of the structures resembles various types of pasta. Formation Neutron stars form as remnants of massive stars after a supernova event. Unlike their progenitor star, neutron stars do not consist of a gaseous plasma. Rather, the intense gravitational attraction of the compact mass overcomes the electron degeneracy pressure and causes electron capture to occur within the star. The result is a compact ball of nearly pure neutron matter with sparse protons and electrons in between in a space several thousand times smaller than the progenitor star. At the surface, the pressure is low enough that conventional nuclei, such as helium and iron, can exist independently of one another and are not crushed together due to the mutual Coulomb repulsion of their nuclei. At the core, the pressure is so great that this Coulomb repulsion cannot support individual nuclei, and some form of ultradense matter, such as the theorized quark‚Äìgluon plasma, should exist. The presence of a small population of protons is essential to the formation of nuclear pasta. The nuclear attraction between protons and neutrons is greater than the nuclear attraction of two protons or two neutrons. Similar to how neutrons act to stabilize heavy nuclei of conventional atoms against the electric repulsion of the protons, the protons act to stabilize the pasta phases. The competition between the electric repulsion of the protons, the attractive force between nuclei, and the pressure at different depths in the star lead to the formation of nuclear pasta. =Phases= While nuclear pasta has not been observed in a neutron star, its phases are theorized to exist in the inner crust of neutron stars, forming a transition region between the conventional matter at the surface and the ultradense matter at the core. Towards the top of this transition region, the pressure is great enough that conventional nuclei will be condensed into much more massive semi-spherical collections. These formations would be unstable outside the star, due to their high neutron content and size, which can vary between tens and hundreds of nucleons. This semispherical phase is known as the gnocchi phase. When the gnocchi phase is compressed, as would be expected in deeper layers of the crust, the electric repulsion of the protons in the gnocchi is not fully sufficient to support the existence of the individual spheres, and they are crushed into long rods, which, depending on their length, can contain many thousands of nucleons. Immersed in a neutron liquid, these rods are known as the spaghetti phase. Further compression causes the spaghetti phase rods to fuse and form sheets of nuclear matter called the lasagna phase. Further compression of the lasagna phase yields the uniform nuclear matter of the outer core with intermittent holes of neutron (and possibly proton) liquid. Progressing deeper into the inner crust, those holes in the nuclear pasta change from being cylindrical, called by some the bucatini phase or antispaghetti phase, into scattered spherical holes, which can be called the Swiss cheese phase. The nuclei disappear at the crust‚Äìcore interface, transitioning into the neutron liquid core of the star. For a typical neutron star of 1.4 solar masses () and 12 km radius, the nuclear pasta layer in the crust can be about 100 m thick and have a mass of about 0.01 . In terms of mass, this is a significant portion of the crust of a neutron star.

The Luzon earthquakes of 1880 partially damaged the church. As a result, the facade was replaced in 1881 with further restoration in 1885. The roof tiles were replaced in 1892 with the lighter, corrugated galvanised iron roofing as further protection from earthquakes. It was again refurbished and enlarged in 1893.

Rovelstad had heard of other efforts to gain authorization for commemorative coins, which were sold by the Mint to a designated group at face value and then retailed to the public at a premium. In 1935, through his congressman, he had legislation introduced into the House of Representatives for a commemorative coin in honor of Elgin's centennial that year. Rovelstad hoped that the proposed coin would both depict and be a source of funds for his memorial to the pioneers. Texas coin dealer L.W. Hoffecker heard of the effort and contacted Rovelstad to offer his assistance‚ÄîHoffecker had been a force behind the Old Spanish Trail half dollar, issued in 1935 and distributed by him. The bill for the Elgin coin did not pass until 1936. Hoffecker was able to sell about 20,000 coins, four-fifths of the issue: the remaining 5,000 were returned to the Mint for melting. Unlike many commemorative coins of that era, the piece was not bought up by dealers and speculators, but was sold directly to collectors at the issue price. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the Elgin coin among the most outstanding American commemoratives.  Inception  Elgin, Illinois, is located on the Fox River about west of Chicago. The community was founded in 1835 by James and Hezekiah Gifford, who named it. It became a village in 1847 and a city in 1854. In the latter year, a watch company was founded there, and the city became well known for the firm's timepieces; it also was notable for the production of tools, shoes, wood products, and weekly church bulletins. Sculptor Trygve Rovelstad (1903‚Äì1990), born to Norwegian immigrants in the United States, sought to erect a statue in his hometown of Elgin as a monument to those pioneers who had settled Illinois. The city leaders approved, and in 1934, a foundation was laid for the statue in Davidson Park, the site of the Giffords' first cabin. Rovelstad was unable to raise the money to construct and erect the statue, but having learned of recent commemorative coin issues, decided this would be a good means of funding the statue. The sculptor had a bill introduced in Congress in May 1935 to authorize a half dollar to celebrate Elgin's centennial and to honor the pioneer. Nevertheless, the bill initially was not considered. News of the bill appeared in the July 1935 The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association [ANA]), and on July 11, Lyman W. Hoffecker wrote to the Elgin Centennial Monumental Committee, inquiring how the coins would be distributed. Hoffecker, an El Paso, Texas, coin dealer, was then leading the committee in his hometown that was selling the Old Spanish Trail half dollar to the public. Although some recent commemoratives had sparked outcry from collectors that speculators had been allowed to buy up quantities of the new issues, Hoffecker would gain praise for equitably distributing the Old Spanish Trail piece. In the correspondence between the two men, Hoffecker gave Rovelstad a number of tips about how to deal with Congress. Even though the bill was still mired in committee, Hoffecker advised what to do once the bill was signed. He did not know yet that Rovelstad was a sculptor, and wrote to him in September 1935 about the models to be submitted for approval, \\"These should also be 10 [inches, or 25.4 cm] in diameter, and this is where your trouble commences. These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, telling you what trouble it is to get the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist.\\" Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer‚Äîthe letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said \\"Loans and Mortgages\\" under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, \\"It would not be good for either of us if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me.\\" In October 1935, Hoffecker made a formal offer, based on the bill, which called for 10,000 half dollars: he would pay the Elgin committee $12,000 and sell the coins at $2.00 each. He would advance the face value of the coins to the Mint, as well as engraving and shipping charges. In selling the coins, he would try to distribute them to as many collectors as possible, leaving dealers and speculators for later. Rovelstad agreed by letter in November.  Preparation  Illinois Representative Chauncey Reed had introduced the Elgin coin legislation at Rovelstad's behest, and both the sculptor and Hoffecker worked with him to advance the bill through Congress. In February 1936, Hoffecker, who had been appointed by ANA President T. James Clarke to lead a committee against abuses in the issuance of commemorative coins, went to Washington, passing through Chicago on his way to visit Rovelstad. The two men had hoped to keep the mintage to 10,000, to be able to sell the coins at a higher price. Congress, however, was not minded to create a low-mintage commemorative, as there had been several issues which had been struck in small numbers only to sell at high prices, and the bill was amended to provide for 25,000 half dollars. Hoffecker hoped to lower the number, urging the sculptor to lobby for a decrease. Hoffecker noted it would be much more work to sell 25,000, and they could not command as high a price. There were a large number of commemorative coin bills in Congress in 1936, and the dealer feared that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would start vetoing them. Hoffecker visited Washington twice more in May, once meeting Rovelstad there, where they lobbied members of Congress. The bill finally passed, and was signed by President Roosevelt on June 16, 1936. The bill required the coins to be struck at a single mint and to bear the date \\"1936\\" regardless of when they were struck. All 25,000 would have to be paid for by the chairman of the Elgin committee (that is, Rovelstad) at one time; a lesser quantity could not be issued. The pieces were \\"in commemoration of the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city of Elgin, Illinois, and the erection of the heroic Pioneer Memorial\\"‚ÄîRovelstad's statue. Hoffecker suggested that Rovelstad seek to have the mintage divided among the three mints, but conceded that unless Congress had erred in the enacted language, this gambit was not likely to succeed. He also told Rovelstad to get in touch with Assistant Mint Director Mary M. O'Reilly and seek to have the coins struck at the Denver Mint, as the closest mint to El Paso, to minimize shipping charges. Nothing came of either proposal; all of the coins would be struck at the Philadelphia Mint. After Rovelstad submitted his designs for the coin to the Mint, they were sent to the Commission of Fine Arts for its opinion. The designs arrived on July 15, 1936, and were approved two days later, with the request that the head of the pioneer on the obverse, in three- quarter view (facing forward and to one side) as submitted by Rovelstad, be in profile instead. The sculptor complied, and submitted plaster models by mid- August; photographs were sent to the commission by the Mint on August 15. Two days later, commission chairman Charles Moore wrote to O'Reilly, stating that the sculptor member of the commission, Lee Lawrie, had viewed the designs, and complained he could not see what the object was behind the pioneers, and that the gun appeared to be held awkwardly. Lawrie also stated that some of the lettering should be strengthened, but if the Mint director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, was not disturbed by these things, the coin should go forward. Moore indicated that he had no desire to delay the coin, and forwarded the commission's recommendation, on condition that the Mint do what it could to address these concerns. With the exception of possible work on the lettering, no changes were made. Once the commission had approved the designs, they were immediately sent to the Medallic Art Company of New York, which reduced the designs to furnish hubs from which coinage dies could be made. In early October 1936, the Philadelphia Mint struck 25,000 coins, with 15 extra for inspection by the 1937 Assay Commission. Rovelstad went to Philadelphia to witness the initiation of production and stayed at the home of Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock. The first ten pieces were handed to the sculptor, who placed them in paper envelopes and took them home to Illinois. According to his wife, Gloria, he was offered a job at the Mint by Sinnock but declined.  Design  The obverse of the Elgin Centennial half dollar depicts a pioneer, attested to by the legend above him. The bearded visage had been previously sculpted by Rovelstad and appears, slightly modified, as the head of the rifleman on the left of the group on the reverse. The year \\"1673\\" on the obverse marks the year explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette entered what is now Illinois. Although the coin was issued for Elgin's centennial, neither the date of founding (1835) nor that of the anniversary appears. The reverse side depicts a group of pioneers (four adults and a baby in its mother's arms). The grouping is a bas relief of the model for the memorial that Rovelstad hoped to build. The child is the second baby to be implied, but not fully seen, on a US coin‚Äìone is sketched with the mother inside the Conestoga wagon on the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926. One would be more fully depicted on the Roanoke Island half dollar in 1937. The grouping had also appeared on Rovelstad's 1935 medal for Elgin's centennial. Rovelstad placed, both on the medal and on the base for the statue, the words, \\"To the men who have blazed the trails, who have conquered the soil, and who have built an empire in the land of the Illini.\\" Inclusion of the various mottos required by statute, such as \\"In God We Trust\\", meant that not even part of this dedication could be placed on the coin. The name of the city was not in the original models that Rovelstad sent Hoffecker for his comments; the numismatist wrote on July 15, 1936, \\"I would not overlook putting the word 'Elgin' on your coin, as it would be a good ad for your city\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on the artistry of American coins, had high praise for the coin and its sculptor: \\"it is more difficult to find a more aesthetically satisfying, technically superior commemorative half-dollar than the Elgin, Illinois, Centennial of 1936.\\" Vermeule observed that the figures on the reverse appear almost three- dimensional. He noted that the technique of spacing out the letters of the word \\"Pioneer\\" above the head presages that used by later Chief Engraver Gilroy Roberts on the obverse of the Kennedy half dollar. According to Vermeule, Rovelstad \\"has produced one of the major documents of sculptural plasticity and vibrant relief in the series of commemorative coins. His obverse is worthy of a Roman medallion, and his reverse rivals the great Neoclassic dies of England or Bavaria in the nineteenth century.\\"  Release  L.W. Hoffecker Once the authorizing legislation was enacted, Hoffecker and Rovelstad came to a new agreement. Hoffecker would advance the money for the new coins and pay for the die making and shipping costs, which were the committee's responsibility under the legislation. The coins would be sold at $1.50 each; Hoffecker would take 35 cents per coin as commission. The coins were to remain on sale through Hoffecker until January 1, 1937 or until they were sold out, whichever came first. The agreement provided that Hoffecker \\"use every ethical means known to him to push the sale of these coins\\". Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his 1937 pamphlet on commemorative coins, stated that he considered the price of $1.50 too high when there was an issue of 25,000 struck. On July 1, 1936, Hoffecker sent 3,500 letters offering the new coins, which had not yet been struck, to people who were on his mailing list or had enquired. He claimed to have 7,000 orders already, and urged collectors not to delay. His bank offered to have the coins shipped there and to carry the coins as part of its cash on hand, which would allow him to pay for them as orders came in, but Hoffecker preferred to pay for the coins at the start. Hoffecker stated in letters that other coin dealers had offered to buy the entire issue, but he had declined. At this time, there was a boom in commemorative coins, and dealers were trying to get all the special issues they could. The Philadelphia Mint shipped 24,990 coins (the authorized mintage less the first ten pieces, which Rovelstad had taken) to Hoffecker on October 7, 1936; they were received in El Paso four days later. Hoffecker wrote to Frank Duffield, editor of The Numismatist, stating that he had the envelopes for already- ordered pieces all prepared, and hoped to mail the last of them out by the evening of October 13; the editor commented, \\"This sounds like real service\\". Several hundred pieces had been ordered through banks in Elgin; they received several consignments and eventually sold over a thousand. The Elgin Watch Company purchased 100 coins. By November 1936, 16,170 pieces had been sold. Only about 2,000 more were sold in the next four months; Hoffecker's statement for March 1937 shows 18,790 sold with an additional 330 on consignment to the First National Bank of Elgin. Rovelstad had received $8,680.00 and Hoffecker $6,576.50. At this point, discussion turned to what to do with the remaining pieces, some 5,620 (a few hundred pieces were given away or otherwise disposed of). Rovelstad agreed to allow the coin dealer to purchase 250 pieces at $1 each; he was still selling them in 1948. Other dealers were uninterested in large purchases as the direct sale to collectors meant that few who wanted and could afford the Elgin coin lacked it. With demand at a standstill, Hoffecker feared that the remaining pieces would wind up in the hands of speculators. Five thousand pieces were returned to the Mint for melting.  Aftermath and collecting  The Pioneer Family Memorial, on the east bank of the Fox River, near the Kimball Street Bridge, in Elgin, Illinois. Rovelstad used the profits from the half dollar to continue work on his statuary group. He sought direct funding from the federal government in 1938 and from the Illinois Legislature the following year; both attempts failed. Through the half century that followed, he progressed on the statues, and by the time of his death in 1990, he had completed the group in plaster of Paris, that still needed to be bronzed before display. Shortly before his death, he told his wife, \\"I've lived a full life and have no regrets. The Pioneer Memorial is now completed. I've done all I could. Now it's up to others to see it erected. I can do no more.\\" Rovelstad's tenant, Steve Youngren, established a foundation to raise money to complete the project. It raised $456,000, exceeding the actual cost by nearly ten percent, and the memorial was completed and dedicated in 2001. Hoffecker served as president of the ANA from 1939 to 1941; he died January 13, 1955 at the age of 86. According to the 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, the Elgin Centennial half dollar lists at $250 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) condition, rising to $550 in near-pristine MS-66. According to numismatic historian Q. David Bowers, \\"nothing untoward was associated with the distribution of the Elgin Centennial half dollars, and certainly at the Illinois end of the deal sculptor Trygve A. Rovelstad's intentions and ethics were of the highest order. L.W. Hoffecker distributed the pieces in a skillfully orchestrated publicity campaign and did as well as anyone could have done at the time.\\"  Notes and references  = References cited = Books   * Other sources     Category:Currencies introduced in 1936 Category:Early United States commemorative coins Category:Elgin, Illinois Category:Fifty-cent coins Category:United States silver coins ","title":"Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar"},{"id":"39797597","text":"The Berehove mine is one of the largest gold mines in Ukraine and in the world.

He is the brother of the deceased drug lord Manuel Torres F√©lix and the former right-hand man of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, a top cartel leader. Born in the state of Sinaloa, Torres F√©lix entered the drug trade in 1990 under the tutelage of the late Juan Manuel Salcido Uzeta (alias \\"El Cochiloco\\"), a Sinaloa Cartel drug trafficker. When his boss was killed, he began to work for Zambada in 1992 and became one of his most trusted associates. In 2001, gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel attempted to kill Torres F√©lix but they were ultimately unsuccessful. When they failed to find his whereabouts, the gunmen responded by killing 12 villagers at a ranch known as El Cajoncito in his hometown. He was arrested by the Mexican Army Special Forces in Culiac√°n in January 2004. He was later extradited to the United States in late 2006, facing charges on drug trafficking. Having completed his sentence, Torres F√©lix was released and deported back to Mexico. As he crossed the international border, the Mexican authorities arrested him in April 2013 for pending charges on organized crime, homicide, and illegal use of firearms. Early life and career Javier Torres F√©lix was born in Cosal√°, Sinaloa, Mexico on 19 October 1960. In 1984, he was arrested in Sinaloa and imprisoned for kidnapping his girlfriend, but he was released months after that. Six years later in 1990, Torres F√©lix entered the drug trade under the tutelage of the drug lord Juan Manuel Salcido Uzeta (alias \\"El Cochiloco\\"), a high-ranking Sinaloa Cartel leader who was killed that same year. In June 1990, he was arrested again by the Mexican Army in Mazatl√°n while in possession of 4 AK-47s and with over of marijuana. He was released from prison a year later. He started working for Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada in 1992, and was thereby placed in the most-wanted list of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). While in California in 1992, he was arrested for drug trafficking but obtained his release five years later and returned to Mexico to continue to work for the Sinaloa Cartel. In Quintana Roo in May 1997, Torres F√©lix was arrested once again while in possession of 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of cocaine but was released in 1998. According to reports by the Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica (PGR), gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel attempted to kill Torres F√©lix and his brother Manuel on 14 February 2001 at El Limoncito de Alay√°, a ranch in the municipality of Cosal√°, Sinaloa. After failing to find both of them, the gunmen sought revenge by killing twelve villagers from the area. Reportedly, the Tijuana Cartel leader Ram√≥n Arellano F√©lix ordered the attack after a dispute over drug shipments. Later that year in October, Torres F√©lix and \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada avoided capture from the Mexican Army and the PGR. In July 2003, the United States Department of Justice indicted \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, Vicente Zambada Niebla, and Torres F√©lix for conspiracy to traffic and distribute cocaine to the United States from Mexico. That indictment specifically stated that from August 2001 to June 2002, his criminal organization provided 1,003 kilograms of cocaine to the New York‚ÄìNew Jersey area (with an estimated value of US$17 million); 1,770 kilograms of cocaine to the Chicago area (with an estimated value of US$30 million); 23 kilograms of cocaine to the state of California (with an estimated value of US$391,000). In the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, several other indictments were filed against Torres F√©lix for his involvement in drug trafficking and money distribution on behalf of the cartel. The Los Angeles indictment charged the drug lord with importing and distributing 5 kilograms of cocaine, and distributing millions of dollars to finance criminal distribution cells in the city. By then, the U.S. government had identified Torres F√©lix as one of the top lieutenants of \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada and as a leading distributor of multi-ton shipments of narcotics. On 17 May 2007, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Torres F√©lix under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with eleven other international criminals and six foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Arrest ICE agents to Mexico (2013). On the morning of 27 January 2004, a commando of the Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), the Mexican Army Special Forces, intercepted Torres F√©lix at a rural community known as La Tula, just outside the city of Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. To avoid the capture of their boss, at least 30 of Torres F√©lix's gunmen confronted the GAFE soldiers as the drug lord fled to one of his many safe houses in Culiac√°n. But Torres F√©lix was later arrested at Colinas de San Miguel neighborhood in Culiac√°n. That same afternoon, the Army transferred the drug lord to Mexico City and handed him over to the PGR. Prior to his arrest, Torres F√©lix was widely regarded as one of the top leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, and the right-hand man of \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada. He operated in the southern parts of Sinaloa and oversaw drug trafficking shipments through Baja California Sur and the United States. Following the arrest, his brother Manuel Torres F√©lix took his position in the cartel and became one of the most trusted men of El Mayo Zambada. Torres F√©lix was imprisoned at Reclusorio Norte in Mexico City at around 10:00 a.m. on 28 January 2004 under solitary confinement. He was kept under tight security and was supervised 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Though initially planned to be transferred to a maximum security prison like Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"La Palma\\") due to his criminal profile and importance, Torres F√©lix was kept in Reclusorio Norte for most of his prison time in Mexico. The U.S. government, however, received intelligence reports that said that Torres F√©lix had reportedly paid a 1.2 million dollar bribe to escape from prison on 25 December 2004. For almost three years, he tried to stop his extradition process but was ultimately unsuccessful. Some objects that were confiscated from him during his arrest are on display at the Museo del Enervante in Mexico City. =Extradition and sentence= On 1 May 2006, a Mexican federal court approved the extradition of Torres F√©lix to the United States, where he faced drug trafficking charges. On 30 November 2006, he was extradited to McAllen, Texas pending charges on conspiracy to traffic multi-ton shipments of cocaine to the U.S. from Mexico. On 9 September 2008, he was found guilty of the charges and was sentenced to 126 months in a federal prison. He was first imprisoned at Federal Correctional Complex, Yazoo City in the state of Mississippi, but was later transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, Beckley in West Virginia, where he served a 6-year sentence. According to extraofficial reports, Torres F√©lix collaborated with U.S. authorities by helping them identify other high-ranking lieutenants within the Sinaloa Cartel in exchange for a shorter sentence. On 12 April 2013 after completing his sentence, Torres F√©lix was released and deported to Mexico. =Deportation and re-arrest= Having fulfilled his sentence in the United States, the U.S. authorities deported Torres F√©lix to Mexico on 12 April 2013. As he crossed the U.S.-Mexico border into Mexicali, he was arrested by the Baja California authorities for organized crime charges, homicide, and for illegal use of weaponry under Mexican law. He was then flown to the Segunda Regi√≥n Militar installations of the Mexican Armed Forces in the state before he was presented to the SEIDO, Mexico's investigatory organized crime division, in Mexico City. He was kept in custody for at least 70 days. On 3 June 2013, Torres F√©lix was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11, a maximum-security prison in Hermosillo, Sonora. Three days later the drug lord was finally transferred to another maximum-security prison, the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico. In January 2014, a Mexican federal judge ordered the PGR to define the legal standing of Torres F√©lix in 60 days given that the drug lord was granted an appeal. Family His son Joel Torres Jim√©nez was subject of several murder attempts and attacks. On 4 April 2008, he was injured from gunshot wounds at the Guadalupe Victoria neighborhood in Culiac√°n. Two years later on 18 January 2010, he was kidnapped but released a couple of days later. On 27 February 2010 at Las Quintas neighborhood in Culiac√°n, unidentified gunmen attempted to kill Torres Jim√©nez while he was traveling in his vehicle. The attack injured him and a woman, and killed the passenger. On 10 June 2012, Torres F√©lix's son was attacked again at Ignacio Allende neighborhood in Culiac√°n by several armed men. His nephew Atanacio Torres Acosta (son of Torres F√©lix's brother Manuel) was killed by gunmen on 19 April 2008 in Culiac√°n. His son Misael Torres Urrea (alias \\"El M2\\") was arrested by soldiers of the Mexican Army at his home in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa on 2 October 2014.

Hypoelastic material models are distinct from hyperelastic material models (or standard elasticity models) in that, except under special circumstances, they cannot be derived from a strain energy density function. Overview A hypoelastic material can be rigorously defined as one that is modeled using a constitutive equation satisfying the following two criteria: 1\\\\. The Cauchy stress \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} at time t depends only on the order in which the body has occupied its past configurations, but not on the time rate at which these past configurations were traversed. As a special case, this criterion includes a Cauchy elastic material, for which the current stress depends only on the current configuration rather than the history of past configurations. 2\\\\. There is a tensor-valued function G such that \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} = G(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma},\\\\boldsymbol{L}) \\\\,, in which \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} is the material rate of the Cauchy stress tensor, and \\\\boldsymbol{L} is the spatial velocity gradient tensor. If only these two original criteria are used to define hypoelasticity, then hyperelasticity would be included as a special case, which prompts some constitutive modelers to append a third criterion that specifically requires a hypoelastic model to not be hyperelastic (i.e., hypoelasticity implies that stress is not derivable from an energy potential). If this third criterion is adopted, it follows that a hypoelastic material might admit nonconservative adiabatic loading paths that start and end with the same deformation gradient but do not start and end at the same internal energy. Note that the second criterion requires only that the function G exists. As explained below, specific formulations of hypoelastic models typically employ a so-called objective stress rate so that the G function exists only implicitly. Hypoelastic material models frequently take the form : \\\\overset{\\\\circ}{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}} = \\\\mathsf{M}:\\\\boldsymbol{d} where \\\\overset{\\\\circ}{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}} is an objective rate of the Kirchhoff stress (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}:=J\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}), \\\\boldsymbol{d}:=\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\boldsymbol{L}+\\\\boldsymbol{L}^T)\\\\right] is the deformation rate tensor, and \\\\mathsf{M} is the so-called elastic tangent stiffness tensor, which varies with stress itself and is regarded as a material property tensor. In hyperelasticity, the tangent stiffness generally must also depend on the deformation gradient in order to properly account for distortion and rotation of anisotropic material fiber directions.  Hypoelasticity and objective stress rates  In many practical problems of solid mechanics, it is sufficient to characterize material deformation by the small (or linearized) strain tensor : \\\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\\\frac 1 2 (u_{i,j} + u_{j,i}) where u_i are the components of the displacements of continuum points, the subscripts refer to Cartesian coordinates x_i (i=1,2,3), and the subscripts preceded by a comma denote partial derivatives (e.g., u_{i,j} = \\\\partial u_i /\\\\partial x_j). But there are also many problems where the finiteness of strain must be taken into account. These are of two kinds: # large nonlinear elastic deformations possessing a potential energy, W(\\\\boldsymbol{F}) (exhibited, e.g., by rubber), in which the stress tensor components are obtained as the partial derivatives of W with respect to the finite strain tensor components; and # inelastic deformations possessing no potential, in which the stress-strain relation is defined incrementally. In the former kind, the total strain formulation described in the article on finite strain theory is appropriate. In the latter kind an incremental (or rate) formulation is necessary and must be used in every load or time step of a finite element computer program using updated Lagrangian procedure. The absence of a potential raises intricate questions due to the freedom in the choice of finite strain measure and characterization of the stress rate. For a sufficiently small loading step (or increment), one may use the deformation rate tensor (or velocity strain) : d_{ij} = \\\\dot \\\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\\\frac 1 2 (v_{i,j} + v_{j,i}) or increment : \\\\Delta \\\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\\\dot \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\Delta t = d_{ij} \\\\Delta t representing the linearized strain increment from the initial (stressed and deformed) state in the step. Here the superior dot represents the material time derivative (\\\\partial /\\\\partial t following a given material particle), \\\\Delta denotes a small increment over the step, t = time, and v_i = \\\\dot u_i = material point velocity or displacement rate. However, it would not be objective to use the time derivative of the Cauchy (or true) stress \\\\sigma_{ij}. This stress, which describes the forces on a small material element imagined to be cut out from the material as currently deformed, is not objective because it varies with rigid body rotations of the material. The material points must be characterized by their initial coordinates X_i (called Lagrangian) because different material particles are contained in the element that is cut out (at the same location) before and after the incremental deformation. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce the so-called objective stress rate \\\\hat \\\\sigma_{ij}, or the corresponding increment \\\\Delta \\\\sigma_{ij} = \\\\hat \\\\sigma_{ij} \\\\Delta t. The objectivity is necessary for \\\\hat \\\\sigma_{ij} to be functionally related to the element deformation. It means that that \\\\hat \\\\sigma_{ij} must be invariant with respect to coordinate transformations (particularly rotations) and must characterize the state of the same material element as it deforms.

Icephobicity vs. hydrophobicity  The term \\"icephobicity\\" is similar to the term hydrophobicity and other ‚Äú-phobicities‚Äù in physical chemistry (oleophobicity, lipophobicity, omniphobicity, amphiphobicity, etc.). The icephobicity is different from de-icing and anti-icing in that icephobic surfaces, unlike the anti-icing surfaces, do not require special treatment or chemical coatings to prevent ice formation, Kulinich, S. A.; Farhadi, S.; Nose, K.; and Du, X. W. Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Are They Really Ice- Repellent?. Langmuir, 2011, 27, 25-29Bahadur, V.; Mishchenko, L.; Hatton, B., Taylor, J.

Anti-Icing Superhydrophobic Coatings. Langmuir, 2009, 25, 12444-12448 There is further parallelism between the hydrophobicity and icephobicity. The hydrophobicity is crucial for the ‚Äúhydrophobic effect‚Äù and hydrophobic interactions. For two hydrophobic molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons) placed in water, there is an effective repulsive hydrophobic force, entropic in its origin, due to their interaction with the water medium. The hydrophobic effect is responsible for folding of proteins and other macro-molecules leading to their fractal shape. During ice crystal (snowflake) formation, the synchronization of branch growth occurs due to the interaction with the medium (oversaturated vapor) ‚Äì is somewhat similar to the hydrophobic effect ‚Äì the apparent repulsion of the hydrophobic particles due to their interaction with the medium (water). Consequently, despite the shapes of snowflakes being very diverse with ‚Äúno two flakes similar to each other,‚Äù most snow crystals are symmetric with each of the six branches almost identical to other five branches. Furthermore, both hydrophobicity and icephobicity can lead to quite complex phenomena, such as self-organized criticality-driven complexity as a result of hydrophobic interactions (during wetting of rough/heterogeneous surfaces or during polypeptide chain folding and looping) or ice crystallization (fractal snowflakes). Note that thermodynamically both the hydrophobic interactions and ice formation are driven by the minimization of the surface Gibbs energy, ŒîG = ŒîH ‚àí TŒîS, where H, T, and S are the enthalpy, temperature, and entropy, respectively. This is because in the hydrophobic interactions large positive value of TŒîS prevails over a small positive value of ŒîH making spontaneous hydrophobic interaction energetically profitable. The so-called surface roughening transition governs the direction of ice crystal growth and occurs at the critical temperature, above which the entropic contribution into the Gibbs energy, TŒîS, prevails over the enthalpic contribution, ŒîH, thus making it more energetically profitable for the ice crystal to be rough rather than smooth. This suggests that thermodynamically both the icephobic and hydrophobic behaviors can be viewed as entropic effects. However, icephobicity is different from the hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity is a property which is characterized by the water contact angle (CA) and interfacial energies of the solid-water, solid-vapor, and water-vapor interfaces and thus it is a thermodynamic property usually quantitatively defined as CA>90 degrees. Another difference is that the hydrophobicity is opposed to the hydrophilicity in a natural way. There is no such an opposition for the icephobicity, which should therefore be defined by setting a quantitative threshold. The icephobicity is much more similar to how the superhydrophobicity is defined.  Quantitative characterization of icephobicity  In recent publications on the subject there are three approaches to the characterization of surface icephobicity. First, the icephobicity implies low adhesion force between ice and the solid surface. In most cases, the critical shear stress is calculated, although the normal stress can be used as well. While no explicit quantitative definition for the icephobicty has been suggested so far, the researchers characterized icephobic surfaces as those having the shear strength (maximum stress) less in the region between 150 kPa and 500 kPa and even as low as 15.6 kPa,. Second, the icephobicity implies the ability to prevent ice formation on the surface. Such ability is characterized by whether a droplet of supercooled water (below the normal freezing temperature of 0 C) freezes at the interface. The process of freezing can be characterized by time delay of heterogeneous ice nucleation. The mechanisms of droplet freezing are quite complex and can depend on the temperature level, on whether cooling down of the droplet is performed from the side of the solid substrate or from vapor and by other factors. Third, the icephobic surfaces should repel incoming small droplets (e.g., of rain or fog) at the temperatures below the freezing point.Zheng et al., Langmuir 27:9936 (2011) These three definitions imply that icephobic surfaces should (i) prevent freezing of water condensing on the surface (ii) prevent freezing of incoming water (iii) if ice formed, it should have weak adhesion strength with the solid, so that it can be easily removed. Anti-icing properties may depend on such circumstances as whether the solid surface is colder than the air/vapor, how big is the temperature gradient, and whether a thin film of water tends to form on the solid surface due to capillary effects, disjoining pressure, etc. Mechanical properties of ice and the substrate also of great importance since ice shedding occurs as fracture, either in the Mode I (normal) or Mode II (shear) cracking, so that crack concentrators are major contributors to the reduced strength,.

The Roman Catholic Pope resides on the Apostolic Throne of St. Peter in Rome Eastern churches reside on the Apostolic Throne of St. Peter in Antioch. These includes the patriarchs of the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and the Maronite Church. Historically, there has also been a Latin patriarch of Antioch. *The Coptic and Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria (also known as the Pope of Alexandria) consider themselves as occupying the throne of St. Mark the Evangelist, who founded the Alexandrian church. *The Catholicos of All Armenians of the Armenian Apostolic Church and consequently also the Armenian Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia (Holy See of Cilicia) and the Patriarchate of Cilicia of the Armenian Catholic Church all consider themselves as occupying the throne of both St. Jude the Apostle (also known as St. Thaddaeus) and St. Bartholomew. *The historical Church of the East and consequently the Catholicos of Assyrian Church of the East and very recently the Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East consider themselves also as successors of St.Thomas, a view also held by Syriac Orthodox, the Maphrian. *Both the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and the Marthoma Metropolitan of the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church believe that they are occupying the Apostolic Throne of St. Thomas. *Saint John was himself associated with the apostolic throne of Ephesus, although this Apostolic See has been canonically vacant since 1922. Other thrones The See of Milan claimed the Apostle Barnabas as its founder, but this was disputed. Nonetheless, this Apostolic Throne was later occupied by the highly important Bishop St. Ambrose, who was the mentor of St. Augustine of Hippo (not to be confused with St. Augustine of Canterbury) presided over the See of Milan, which follows a distinctive rite, the Ambrosian Rite, with a liturgy somewhat different from that of Latin Rite Catholicism. The Archbishop of Canterbury is crowned atop St. Augustine's Chair, referring to the first holder of that office, St. Augustine of Canterbury, not to be confused with the earlier theologian St. Augustine of Hippo.

Foundation The Railroad Yardmasters of America was organized on 2 December 1918 to handle abuses by railroad management. Membership was open to \\"any male white person of good moral character actually employed as general yardmaster, assistant general yardmaster, yardmaster, assistant yardmaster, and station masters.\\" The first national convention was held in December 1918. The union had its headquarters in Columbus, Ohio. The union was independent, not affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The union aimed for a universal eight-hour work day with two days of rest each month and an annual two-week vacation. It also sought improved wages and working conditions. The union's bylaws gave it the power to levy assessments for unspecified purposes, saying the Executive Board could \\"levy assessments upon all the members affected when in its opinion such assessments are necessary.\\" History By 1921 the union had about 8,500 members, about three quarters of all yardmasters in the United States. A general railway strike was called for 1 November 1921. The grand president of the Railroad Yardmasters of America, J.L. Cone said the members of his union would stay on the job. Yardmasters on the Southern Pacific Railroad organized in 1938 and joined the Railroad Yardmasters of America in 1941. Twelve years later they withdrew and formed the independent Western Railway Supervisors Association, which merged with the Transportation-Communications Union in 1983. The union was one of 26 in the United States that limited its membership to white men through its constitution or rituals. In 1950 there were a series of disputes between the railroads and yard employees in connection with the 40-hour week. That year the government seized the railroads. The government's Railway Labor Act Emergency Board ruled on 15 June 1950 in favor of the 40-hour basic work week, overtime pay for work in excess of 40 hours, and other improvements. When the railroad owners rejected this John R. Steelman, the President's representative, defined a proposed settlement that included wage increases and cost of living adjustments. The Railroad Yardmasters of America, Railroad Yardmasters of North America and the Switchmen's Union of America agreed to settle with some railroads based on the Steelman formula effective 1 October 1950, but other operating unions held out. In Railroad Yardmasters of America v Robert O. Harris (1983) the union challenged the authority of the National Mediation Board on the basis that it had no quorum, establishing the \\"Yardmasters exception\\", which came to be used in other labor relations cases. Dissolution In 1985 the RYA voted to affiliate with the United Transportation Union. The merger took effect on 1 October 1985.

It was also met with positive reviews from music critics.  Background  Just prior to the release of his debut album The Art of Dying, Cashis revealed he had already begun to work on his second studio album Euthanasia, which he claimed was 65% done in September 2012. He also revealed that it would feature production from Jake One and Eminem, also while projecting a May 2013 release for the project. Upon the release of the first single in May 2013, the album was renamed The County Hound 2. On September 28, 2013, Cashis revealed the cover art and track list to the album, also announcing a release date of October 15, 2013. He also revealed previously unannounced guest appearances on the album to come from Boaz, and Demrick among others, with the album's production to be primarily handled by him and his frequent collaborator Rikanatti (who they both executive produce and handle the A&R; Direction for the album), with Eminem also producing significantly on the album.

Release and promotion  On December 25, 2012, Cashis released the first mixtape in promotion of the album titled Loose Cannon, which was previously going to be the title of his third studio album. In July 2013, Cashis announced that he was also working on his next mixtape The Loose Cannon 2, which would contain mostly freestyles.

The album was released digitally on October 15, 2013, with physical copies to be released two weeks later. It was also released for free stream on its digital release day for a limited time. On October 31, 2013, Cashis announced that he would be releasing a high quantity of music videos for songs from the album soon. Following the album's release, Cashis and Demrick toured through the rest of 2013.  Singles  On April 30, 2013, Cashis released the first single from his newly titled second studio album The County Hound 2, titled \\"Layin in the Cut\\" which was produced by Eminem and Rikanatti.

Two days later, Cashis premiered the track \\"Hi\\" from the album. Later that day, it was released to iTunes as the album's fifth single.  Critical reception  The County Hound 2 was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Omar Burgess of HipHopDX gave it a positive review saying, \\"Ultimately, The County Hound 2 serves as a welcome return for loyal Ca$his fans. Name recognition from his Shady days, production from Eminem and some of the lighter singles will likely draw in newcomers.

After a brief stint in London, he moved to New York in 1904, and continued collecting folklore among the Yiddish-speaking Jews of New York. In 1925, Cahan helped organize the American branch of the YIVO, and was selected to lead its Folklore Committee. He was instrumental in expanding the folklore collection efforts of YIVO, and in 1930 returned to Vilna to train young scholars. After his death, YIVO planned to publish all of his works (collections of folk songs and folktales, and theoretical works), but only the folktales volume was published before the remaining material was destroyed during World War II.

The anthology features Roger Rabbit, the animated protagonist from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, being enlisted the task of caring for Baby Herman while his mother is absent, resulting in a plot defined by slapstick humor and visual gags. Each short concludes with a sequence involving live-action and animation, where the characters interact with live-action human beings, akin to the 1988 film. Charles Fleischer, Kathleen Turner, Lou Hirsch, and April Winchell returned to reprise their voice roles from the film, alongside producers Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall, and Don Hahn. Marshall also directed the live-action segments in the first two shorts, while Industrial Light & Magic was responsible for the live-action visual effects. Produced in association with Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, the three shorts (Tummy Trouble, Roller Coaster Rabbit and Trail Mix-Up) were originally attached to the theatrical releases of several Disney and Amblin films. A fourth short, Hare in My Soup, was cancelled during pre-production with three more (Clean and Oppressed, Beach Blanket Bay and Bronco Bustin' Bunny) in the planning stages also cancelled. Tummy Trouble =Plot= Roger is placed in charge of watching Baby Herman when his mother needs to step out for an hour; as soon as she leaves, Herman breaks into a heavy crying fit which Roger doesn't seem to be able to break until he pulls out a bright shiny rattle, which immediately garners Herman's attention. After a brief second of shaking it, Herman swallows the rattle, prompting Roger to scream and call 911 and to rush the baby to the emergency room. Roger is overcome with guilt when he visits, but quickly realizes Herman wants to drink from a milk bottle in the room; after Roger burps Herman, he hiccups the rattle, but finds, that in Roger's joyous celebration he accidentally swallows it, causing Baby Herman to become upset he lost his toy. Roger begins to dance, and has his hips rattling with the toy and giving Baby Herman some amusement, but is stunned when a doctor bursts in and mistakes Roger for Baby Herman and preps him for emergency surgery. While Roger is gone, Herman spies Jessica Rabbit pushing a cart of milk bottles and gives chase, eventually following a runaway milk bottle into the emergency room where Roger is strapped to the table while the surgeons had disappeared for a lunch break. Herman mistakes a large surgical laser for a bottle and climbs up onto it, nearly dissecting Roger in the process. The laser detaches itself from the ceiling and flings a table of scalpels and hypodermic needles at Roger, who avoids them, but is electrocuted in the process. The laser flies around the room and lodges itself under Roger's stretcher and sends him and Herman both ejecting from the emergency room and causing Roger to gag up the rattle, and when Baby Herman to again swallow it before crashing into a wheelchair, they then fly down the hall and into an open elevator shaft due to wet floors causing the wheelchair they landed on to skid out of control. Baby Herman's diaper parachutes him safely to a floor while Roger ends up getting crushed by an elevator while trying to catch Herman. Eventually they end up in a room with piles of gas pumps which are ignited and send them the pair launching miles into the air. As they fall, Herman coughs up the rattle, and causes Roger to swallow it again. As they crash back into the hospital, Roger crashes through several floors before landing smack down on the receptionist floor in the hospital. As he recovers, Baby Herman lands on Roger, causing him to cough up the rattle again, finally ending their adventure. But when Roger's celebration is short lived when he sees the bill for their rampant destruction and faints that he didn't win again, Herman then crawls over to the rattle and as the screen fades to black there is a gulping sound as he again swallows the rattle. During the end credits, however, Herman spits the rattle out, and angrily threatens more trouble if he has to swallow the rattle again. After attempting to cool Baby Herman down Roger is greeted by Jessica who seductively suggests they go home and play a little patty cake, a love stricken Roger coos as they walk off. =Cast= *Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit *Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit *Lou Hirsch as Adult Baby Herman *April Winchell as Mrs. Herman and Young Baby Herman *Corey Burton as the surgeons *Richard Williams as Droopy =Production= Tummy Trouble was produced over the course of nine months by a staff of 70 Disney animators. It was the first animated short Disney had produced in 16 years to accompany the original release of a feature film, since Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too in 1974. The short was released with Walt Disney Pictures' Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, theatrically and on that film's initial video release.Aljean Harmetz, \\"Marketing Magic, With Rabbit, for Disney Films,\\" New York Times, July 19, 1989. pg. C15Spelling, Ian, \\"Rabbit in Shadows,\\" Comics Scene, #9, October 1989, Starlog Communications International, Inc., p. 54. An adaptation of this short appeared in the graphic novel Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom. The short has been released with several films, including Aladdin (1993, UK), The Lion King (1994, USA) and Pocahontas (1995, Australia). Roller Coaster Rabbit =Plot= Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman and Mrs. Herman are at the local county fair. Mrs. Herman is going to get her palm read by a fortune teller, she ask Roger to watch Baby Herman until she gets back and messes up again or else. Roger reluctantly watches Baby Herman. Baby Herman loses his red balloon and bursts into tears when Roger goes to get him a new one. Before he returns, however, Baby Herman sees another red balloon at a dart game and goes to try to get it. When Roger comes back to give Baby Herman his balloon, he finds that he is gone, and sets off as the chase begins. First, Baby Herman finds himself following the balloon into a field occupied by a grazing bull. Roger soon follows the youngster and falls in bull dung. Baby Herman walks directly underneath the bull. He notices a round balloon-like object and grasps it; unknown to him, it is in fact the bull's scrotum. The grazing creature snaps. Roger picks up Baby Herman but just happens to be looking the bull in the eyes. The animal hurls Roger and Baby Herman into the air, sending them flying out of the field, and causing the two to land crashing into a roller coaster carriage which is traveling slowly up. In the next stage of this short, the carriage continues to climb a tall hill in the track. The two reach the top of the drop which is exaggerated to reach beyond the clouds and into space. Roger looks down and sees the world. Moments later the carriage drops down thousands of meters. The speed of the drop is maintained throughout the remainder of the chase. After a few twist and turns (in the track) a shot of Jessica Rabbit appears, where she is tied down to the tracks, unable to move. She calls out to be saved before Roger and Baby Herman's carriage crushes her. As the cart draws near, it topples over and fortunately bounces over Jessica, avoiding her completely. The camera moves along and beside her appears Droopy for a quick one-liner. The story then continues. Roger grasps onto Baby Herman, tumbling and losing their carriage, leaving Roger sliding along the tracks with his feet, gradually gaining friction causing his feet to catch fire. The tracks run into a dark tunnel and then stumbles across a 'wrong way sign'. Finally Herman and Roger crash through the sign and into a real-life filming studio, a direct reference to the reality/cartoon crossover in the feature film when Roger ruins the film and refuses to go back to do the whole scene again. =Cast= *Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit *Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit *Lou Hirsch as Adult Baby Herman *April Winchell as Mrs. Herman and Young Baby Herman *Corey Burton as Droopy *Frank Welker as the Bull Additional cast *Charlie Adler as the men's voiceovers (uncredited) =Production= Roller Coaster Rabbit (along with Trail Mix-Up) was produced at The Magic of Disney Animation located at Disney-MGM Studios in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Rob Minkoff returned to direct the second short in the series. Spielberg wanted the short to appear with Arachnophobia, Hollywood Pictures' first feature and a co-production between Disney and Amblin. However, CEO Michael Eisner opted to release the short with the US theatrical release of Touchstone Pictures' Dick Tracy, in hopes that the short would increase awareness to the film. Spielberg, who controlled a 50% ownership stake in the character, decided to cancel Hare in My Soup, the third short that had entered production. This short was re-released with Toy Story in 1995. Trail Mix- Up =Plot= The short features Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman and Mrs. Herman at the park setting up camp. Mrs. Herman plans to go hunting and leaves Roger in charge of watching Baby Herman. Trouble begins when Baby Herman wanders off into the dangers of the forest and Roger has to go and save him, leading to multiple calamities; such as Roger panicking at the sight of a harmless bug and spraying so much insecticide (named Mink-Off) that many trees die. Later, Baby Herman follows a bee up to a beehive and goes to get some honey when Roger tries to save him. The beehive falls on Roger's head, causing him to get stung multiple times. The bees proceed to chase him, so Roger runs into a lake, where he panics at the sight of a shark's dorsal fin (which is actually controlled by Droopy). Later, Baby Herman follows a beaver (mistaking him for a dog), and is followed by Roger, who chases after them. Baby Herman follows the beaver up a pile of logs, and is chased by Roger, who follows, only to have the log that Baby Herman and the beaver are on taken to the sawmill. This ends up with Roger being shredded by a sawmill (that of which the result is 13 tiny Rogers, which then join again into a regular-sized Roger, who follows Baby Herman (still following the beaver) onto a conveyor belt with logs). It ends up with the logs being thrown down a log flume, eventually landing in a river. The log, Roger, Baby Herman, and the beaver are on, crashes into a bear, who also ends up on the log. Then the four fall off a waterfall. Roger's head gets stuck in a twig sticking out of the waterfall, and when he catches Baby Herman (holding on to the beaver), the bear grabs onto Roger's legs. The combined weight rebounds, sending all four flying, landing on a large boulder. The boulder proceeds to roll down a hill, knocking over a tree trunk (with the same sound effects as a bowling pin), and then flying off a cliff. Eventually, Roger, the bear, the log, the beaver, the boulder, and Baby Herman all land on top of Old Predictable Geyser in that order. Then, Old Predictable Geyser erupts, sending the group flying out of the studio above Hollywood, landing on Mount Rushmore, and destroying it. Everyone is battered and beaten; as they walk away, Baby Herman yells at Roger for destroying a national landmark. Roger retorts that it's \\"not as if it's the end of the world,\\" but then sticks a flag (made of his pants) in the ground which punctures the world, making it deflate and blow away like a balloon. =Cast= *Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit *Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit *Lou Hirsch as Adult Baby Herman *April Winchell as Mrs. Herman and Young Baby Herman *Corey Burton as Droopy *Frank Welker as the Bear and Beaver Additional cast *Alice Playten as the Bee (uncredited) =Production= Trail Mix-Up was directed by Barry Cook, instead of Rob Minkoff, who remained as a co-executive producer. Trail Mix-Up was the third and last Roger Rabbit short, and was again produced by Disney's Florida studio. Unlike the two previous shorts, the animation and composting was done digitally in the studio's CAPS system. The short was released theatrically with Disney/Amblin's A Far Off Place on March 12, 1993. This short has been released with several films, including Tarzan (1999, UK), Treasure Planet (2002, USA), and Brother Bear (2003, Australia). Home media In 1995, a VHS tape of the three shorts was released under the title It's Roger Rabbit, bundled with Who Framed Roger Rabbit. A nearly identical video was released by itself in 1996 under the title Disney and Steven Spielberg present The Best of Roger Rabbit. The three shorts are also included in the 2003 special edition \\"Vista Series\\" DVD of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. On March 12, 2013, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment remastered and reissued all three shorts as part of the 25th anniversary Blu-ray release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

It was designed by Yakima architect John W. Maloney in an adapted Classical Revival style for the federal Indian Bureau as the agency's point of liaison with the Yakama Nation. By 1946 the structure was vacated by the Indian Bureau, and it was sold to the local school district in 1949 and was used as a junior high school until 1954. In 1954 it became a library, to which a museum of local history was added in 1976. Description The Yakima Indian Agency is a two-story brick structure measuring to the front and rear and along the sides. A by bay protrudes from the rear elevation. The building features a stringcourse where the original roof rested at the top of the first floor. The corners are marked by brick buttresses extending full height, with tiled skirt roof elements in between. The entry is marked by a small Ionic portico at the top of a flight of stairs. Windows are casement units dividing in the middle on the front and sides, with single swinging sashes to the rear. The first floor windows have arched blind lunettes above with stone keystones.

History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1432, but the church existed earlier. Very little is known about the location of the original stave church, but around 1620, the building was taken down and moved across the fjord and rebuilt on the site of the Norddal Church. For a time, there was no church in Sylte. In 1812, a small chapel located at D√∏ving, just upriver from Sylte, was moved to Sylte and it became the new Sylte Church. In 1860, residents began talking about building a larger church in Sylte to serve the growing population. In 1863, a new church was completed on the same site as the older (smaller) church.

Charles Pasley, C.B., R.E., (14 November 1824 ‚Äì 11 November 1890) was a British Army officer and Colonial Engineer, Commissioner of Public Works and politician in colonial Victoria. Early life Pasley was the son of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Pasley, K.C.B., and his second wife Martha Matilda n√©e Roberts. He was born at Brompton barracks Chatham, Kent, England, and was educated at the King's School, Rochester, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich from 1840. He obtained a commission as second lieutenant in the royal engineers on 20 December 1843. He went through the usual course of professional instruction at the military school at Chatham, of which his father was the head, and proved himself so good a surveyor and mathematician that for some months he temporarily held the appointment of instructor in surveying and astronomy. After serving at several home stations he was promoted first lieutenant on 1 April 1846, and in June was sent to Canada. He was employed on the ordinary military duties of his corps until 1848, when he was appointed to assist in the survey of the extensive and scattered ordnance lands on the Rideau canal. The outdoor survey was done in the winter to enable the surveyors to chain over the frozen lakes, and to avoid the malaria and mosquitoes of the swamps. In 1849 he was sent to the Bermuda islands, and while there was mainly employed in superintending, on behalf of the colonial government, the work of deepening the channel into St. George's Harbour. In November 1850 he returned to England on account of ill-health. In February 1851 he was selected to join the staff of the Great Exhibition of that year. He served at Bermuda in 1850. Career in Australia Pasley arrived at Melbourne on 18 September 1853, having been appointed in the spring of that year Colonial Engineer to the colony of Victoria. He found himself at the head of a considerable department, to which that of Colonial Architect was very soon added, and subsequently that of Central Road Board. In 1854 he was member of a commission to make arrangements for an exhibition of colonial products at the Paris Exhibition in the following year. In October 1854 he was nominated to a seat on the Victorian Legislative Council. About this time the Ballarat riots broke out, and he offered his services to the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham, and was sent to the goldfields on a special mission. In 1855 the new constitution came into force in Victoria, and the first responsible ministry was formed by William Haines in November 1855, General Pasley taking the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works. On 10 December he was appointed a member of the Executive Council, and a few months later was made by an Act of Council a joint trustee with Captain (later Lieut.-General Sir) Andrew Clarke, R.E., for the Melbourne and Mount Alexander Railway, purchased by Government. In 1856 Captain Pasley was elected to the first Victorian Legislative Assembly for South Bourke, and in March 1857 he resigned with the rest of the Ministry, but ultimately consented to remain as professional head of the Department of Public Works. The Houses of Parliament were amongst the public buildings erected under Pasley's direction, and some of the principal streets of Melbourne were laid out during his term of office. The last public building with which he was connected was the Melbourne Post Office, but this was not completed till after his return to England. Captain Pasley also took great interest in the Botanic Gardens and the Herbarium, which was built under his auspices. In 1860 he resigned his connection with the Public Works Department, with the intention of returning to England; but his interest in the welfare of the colony of Victoria and of the city of Melbourne was as keen as ever in after years. Before his departure from the colony, the New Zealand war broke out, and he immediately offered his services, which were accepted the same day, and he was appointed an extra member of Major-General (afterwards Sir) Thomas Pratt's staff. Three months later he was severely wounded by a bullet in the thigh, while in charge of the trenches, after laving out and constructing a parallel needed in the capture of the Kaihihi Pas. His wound proving serious, he became unfit for further duty, and returned to Melbourne invalided. For his services in New Zealand he was mentioned in despatches, and promoted to brevet-major, he having become captain soon after his arrival in Melbourne. Pasley also received the New Zealand Medal. Later life Pasley left for England in May 1861, in the steamship Great Britain. He left Melbourne amid popular demonstrations of regret. On arrival in England in August 1861 Pasley was appointed commanding royal engineer at Gravesend. In 1862 he read a paper before the Royal United Service Institution on the operations in New Zealand, to correct some misapprehensions on the subject which existed in the public mind with regard to his old general. In 1864 he was employed as Acting Agent-General for the colony of Victoria, a temporary appointment which he held for four years, with leave from the War Office, and afterwards from the Admiralty, to accommodate the colony until they could make a permanent appointment. In this capacity he superintended on behalf of the colony the equipment of , and the design, construction, armament and despatch of turret ship . He again acted as Agent-General for Victoria from 1880 to 1882. From 1873 to 1882 he held the Imperial appointment of Director of Works of the Navy, in succession to Sir Andrew Clarke. Pasley became colonel in April 1876, and retiring from the army with the honorary rank of major-general in August 1881. General Pasley, who died at Chiswick, London, on 11 November 1890, married at Hampton, Middlesex, on 29 March 1864, Charlotte, eldest daughter of John Roberts, of Barzell, Sussex, who survived him.

In a software-defined data center, \\"all elements of the infrastructure ‚Äî networking, storage, CPU and security ‚Äì are virtualized and delivered as a service.\\" While ITaaS may represent an outcome of SDDC, SDDC is differently cast toward integrators and datacenter builders rather than toward tenants. Software awareness in the infrastructure is not visible to tenants. SDDC support can be claimed by a wide variety of approaches. Critics see the software-defined data center as a marketing tool and \\"software-defined hype,\\" noting this variability. In 2013, an analyst projected that at least some software-defined data center components would experience market growth. The software-defined networking market is expected to be valued at about US$3.7 billion by 2016, compared to US$360 million in 2013. IDC estimates that the software-defined storage market is poised to expand faster than any other storage market. Description and core components The software-defined data center encompasses a variety of concepts and data-center infrastructure components, with each component potentially provisioned, operated, and managed through an application programming interface (API). Core architectural components that comprise the software-defined data center include the following: * computer virtualization, \\\\- a software implementation of a computer * software-defined networking (SDN), which includes network virtualization - the process of merging hardware and software resources and networking functionality into a software-based virtual network * software-defined storage (SDS), which includes storage virtualization, suggests a service interface to provision capacity and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for storage, including performance and durability * management and automation software, enabling an administrator to provision, control, and manage all software-defined data-center components A software- defined data center differs from a private cloud, since a private cloud only has to offer virtual-machine self-service, beneath which it could use traditional provisioning and management. Instead, SDDC concepts imagine a data center that can encompass private, public, and hybrid clouds. Origins and development Data centers traditionally lacked the capacity to accommodate total virtualization. By 2013, companies began laying the foundation for software-defined data centers with virtualization. Ben Cherian of Midokura considered Amazon Web Services as a catalyst for the move toward software- defined data centers because it \\"convinced the world that the data center could be abstracted into much smaller units and could be treated as disposable pieces of technology, which in turn could be priced as a utility.\\" Potential impact In 2013, the software-defined data center term was promoted as a paradigm shift. According to Steve Herrod, the promise of the software-defined data center was that companies would no longer need to rely on specialized hardware or hire consultants to install and program hardware in its specialized language. Rather, IT would define applications and all of the resources they require‚Äîincluding compute, storage, networking, security, and availability‚Äîand group all of the required components to create a ‚Äúlogical application.‚Äù Commonly cited benefits of software-defined data centers include improved efficiency from extending virtualization throughout the data center; increased agility from provisioning applications quickly; improved control over application availability and security through policy-based governance; and the flexibility to run new and existing applications in multiple platforms and clouds. In addition, a software-defined data center implementation could reduce a company's energy usage by enabling servers and other data center hardware to run at decreased power levels or be turned off. Some believe that software-defined data centers improve security by giving organizations more control over their hosted data and security levels, compared to security provided by hosted-cloud providers. The software-defined data center was marketed to drive down prices for data center hardware and challenge traditional hardware vendors to develop new ways to differentiate their products through software and services. Challenges The concepts of software-defined in general, and software-defined data centers in particular, have been dismissed by some as ‚Äúnonsense,‚Äù ‚Äúmarketecture,‚Äù and ‚Äúsoftware- defined hype.‚Äù Some critics believe that only a minority of companies with ‚Äúcompletely homogeneous IT systems‚Äô‚Äù already in place, such as Yahoo! and Google, can transition to software-defined data centers. According to some observers, software-defined data centers won‚Äôt necessarily eliminate challenges that relate to handling the differences between development and production environments; managing a mix of legacy and new applications; or delivering service-level agreements (SLAs). Software-defined networking was seen as essential to the software-defined data center, but it is also considered to be the ‚Äúleast mature technology‚Äù required to enable the software-defined data center. However, several companies, including Arista Networks, Cisco, Microsoft and VMware, market products to enable virtual networks that are provisioned, extended, and moved across existing physical networks. Several competing network virtualization standards already existed by 2012. Neutron, the networking component of the open-source software OpenStack project, provides an application-level abstraction of network resources and includes an interface for configuring virtual switches. The software-defined data center approach will force IT organizations to adapt. Software-defined environments require rethinking many IT processes‚Äîincluding automation, metering, and billing‚Äîand executing service delivery, service activation, and service assurance. A widespread transition to the SDDC could take years.

He completed a Diploma of Visual Arts in 1977 at the Massachusetts College of Art & Design in Boston, followed by a Graduate Diploma in 1980 and a Master of Fine Art in 1982. He was appointed Associate Professor in Fine Art at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne in 1995 and was head of the graduate programme in Hong Kong until 2010. Batt lives and works in Melbourne. Exhibitions Batt began exhibiting in 1974 at the Leveson Gallery, Melbourne and has continued to exhibit regularly, participating in over 40 solo and group shows. Since 1986 he has been exhibiting at Niagara Galleries, Melbourne, with his most recent show, A Delicate Balance, taking place in 2011. Batt has shown his work extensively in Australia, exhibiting at Michael Nagy Fine Art and DC-ART in Sydney, as well as internationally, with shows at the John Batten Gallery and 10 Chancery Lane Gallery in Hong Kong, Waikato Museum in Hamilton, New Zealand and various galleries in Boston, during his days as a student at the Massachusetts College of Art & Design. Batt has also been included in various Australian and international art fairs, such as the Melbourne Art Fair in 2010 and 2006 and the Australian Contemporary Art Fair in 2002, 1994, 1992 and 1988. Most recently, Batt showed at the Korea International Art Fair at the COEX Convention & Exhibition Center in Seoul in 2010 and the Gong Ju National Art Festival at the Lim Lip Museum, South Korea in 2006. In 2002 Batt undertook a residency at the Ernst-Mach Foundation in France, where he produced a number of paintings and sculptures that were included as part of his Point of No Return exhibition at Niagara Galleries. Painting Batt's studio practice includes both painting and sculpture. His paintings act as visual puns, a humorous and autobiographical take on order and rationality in the late twentieth century. His work is informed by an American lineage of art making and the influence from American pop and folk art are apparent in his classic cars, big cities and wild west pop romanticism. His paintings are curious figurative tableaus, where absurd figures interact and perform. Sculpture His sculptural work features constructed wood or cast bronze characters. These figures have been released from his canvases and appear in real space. As with the paintings, they are a combination of surreal, na√Øve and primitive aesthetics. Stripes cover the surface of the sculpture in a collision of modernist painting and animal camouflage. Moving parts are incorporated with the use of small solar panels. The sun supporting new media. Collections Batt's work is represented in the permanent collections of major Australian galleries such as the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra and the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and numerous state, regional and university collections, such as the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery, Bendigo Art Gallery, Latrobe Valley Arts Centre, Victoria, Dobell Foundation, Sydney, Gold Coast City Art Gallery, Queensland and the RMIT Collection, Melbourne.

Zeng entered politics in 1991, when he became a Workers' Party member; thereafter he renounced his affiliation to the group and became a perennial candidate in Singaporean elections, albeit always dropping out of contention at the last minute. Zeng was also an active acupuncturist who arranged for global meetings and operated an acupuncture centre in Singapore, later changing his focus to selling healthcare products after a string of molestation lawsuits initiated by his patients. Zeng was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014; this necessitated the excision of his entire nose, which led to significant facial disfigurement, and he became a tissue paper peddler, abandoning his previous jobs. Zeng was found dead at foot of Geylang Bahru block, Singapore, on 16 November 2019. Early life Zeng was born Chan Hock Seng in 1953, the eldest son of a clerk and a homemaker. Zeng became estranged with his siblings following a dispute regarding their father's will. A March 1987 Straits Times report states that Zeng's highest level of education was secondary school, but Zeng claims to have \\"a Doctor in Science degree, a Doctor in Medicine degree and a PhD in Complementary Medicine\\". Between 1977 and 1978, he was President of Dale Carnegie Alumni Association's Lion Chapter of Singapore, an oratorical society. Career =Early career= Zeng was once a safety officer at a Shell production platform at Pulau Bukom. He officially became a member of the Singapore-based political party Workers' Party (WP) on 18 August 1991 because \\"the PAP government obviously wants an opposition in Parliament\\", and was fielded as a candidate for the Bukit Timah Single Member Constituency in the 1991 Singaporean general election. He netted a quarter of the 22,000 votes cast, losing out to the PAP's Wang Kai Yuen. Zeng decided to leave the party that year because, in his words, \\"in politics, all the crows are black\\". In a 1996 lawsuit he was involved in, Zeng stated that he contested the 1991 general election only to gain publicity for his acupuncture business. =Perennial candidacy= Zeng at the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple in December 2015. After leaving the Workers' Party, Zeng became a perennial candidate for election in Singapore. He ran for the Mountbatten Single Member Constituency during the 2006 Singaporean general election, but was unsuccessful. Believing himself to be ineligible for candidacy, Zeng decided not to take part in the 2011 Singaporean general election. He had been present at a nomination centre, with the relevant documents in hand, but upon being reminded of an offence he committed in 2009 he ripped them into pieces and stormed out of the venue while repeatedly underscoring that \\"they have fixed me up\\" and \\"you (the reporters present) know what it is all about\\" without any elaboration. A news anchor at scene observed that Zeng's nomination papers had been left blank all along. In May 2012, Zeng announced his intention to contest the 2012 Singaporean by-election, but did not complete the nomination process. Zeng alleged that he was informed that he could not contest because of an offence he had incurred four years ago ‚Äì scolding two police officers with vulgarities, to which he argued it was his bird that committed the deed. It was later clarified in an official statement by the Singapore Elections Department that Zeng \\"did not file his nomination papers\\". During the 2013 Singaporean by-election, Zeng decided not to contest as he suspected a conspiracy against him, claiming that he first needed \\"the President's pardon\\". He also explained that he wanted to give in to candidates of higher caliber than him, adding that \\"fools rush in where angels fear to tread\\". In August 2015, he declared that he would be contesting the Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency, pledging to \\"fight until the end\\", but after less than a week he changed his mind, citing his being the only independent running his good ties with Chiam See Tong and not wanting his participation to cause a three-cornered-contest as reasons for his withdrawal. Furthermore, he revealed he could not have secured the election deposit alone and was relying on his \\"fifteen compassionate backers\\". =Other ventures= 230x230px Having studied the subject in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Zeng was an acupuncturist, and organised acupuncture meet-ups as the president of the World Acupuncture Voluntary Organisation (WAVO). After Zeng published controversial and self-admittedly \\"misleading\\" advertisements of it in 1991, the 28th World Congress of Acupuncture and Complementary Medicine, which was supposed to have taken place in Singapore, changed its host country to the Republic of China. Zeng, in defence, cited 'miscommunication' with the Medicina Alternativa Institute in Sri Lanka. He also blamed the local press for this happening and promptly left the Singapore Acupuncture Association. As a philanthropist, Zeng funded the construction of a mosque in an unspecified Bangladeshi village. Zeng was the founder of the Prof Zeng's Medical Centre, which used to be an Upper Serangoon Road-based acupuncture centre. It moved to Toa Payoh, at which the sole basis of operations became selling healthcare products, including slimming oil and a \\"hair regrowth shampoo\\" made of vegetable and chocolate. He also owned a MacPherson-based store. He drew attention when he used photographs of President of Singapore S. R. Nathan to endorse his healthcare products, in 2007. The act was deemed as \\"outrageous\\" by one Singaporean lawyer, who added that it may constitute defamation. Zeng's Medical Centre folded after he was diagnosed as having cancer. In 2002, Zeng self-published a book on the September 11 attacks, titled Why The World Trade Centre Collapse So So Fast? (sic). The work, which contains numerous references to the 1976 monster thriller King Kong, was banned by the government upon its release. =Media and public image= Zeng's eccentric personality and mannerisms earned him considerable coverage in local media, and is frequently referred to as Parrot Man, a moniker that came about after Zeng blamed his pet parrot for committing a crime he was charged for. Benson Ang stressed the controversy surrounding Zeng, describing him as \\"Toa Payoh's nutty professor\\". Tessa Wong of The Straits Times acknowledged that his appearance during elections \\"does add colour to what is otherwise a serious day\\". Others facetiously dub him as an \\"election veteran\\" in Singapore while noting his tendency of not filing his nomination papers and his public antics; Ilsa Chan, writing for Toggle SG, billed Zeng as \\"the candidate who never gives up\\" but found his backing out of the 2015 general election bizarre. Singaporean comedian and blogger Lee Kin Mun, better known as mrbrown, portrayed Zeng in a satirical video on the 2013 Punggol East by-election. Zeng is notable for his unorthodox, Arab-style clothing, often appearing in his \\"signature\\" thawb, accompanied by either a red-and-white keffiyeh or a golden scarf. He was also seen in a baju kurung and songkok during the 2011 Singaporean general election. Personal life Zeng's spouse, Lili Han Yizi. Zeng was married to Lili Han Yizi (; born 1956), and they had two sons King Yee and King Yew. A 26 March 1987 The Straits Times report on Zeng stated that his English name was Thomas. In a 1996 lawsuit he was involved in, Zeng claimed to have a net worth of ten million dollars. He reportedly took \\"more than 10 minutes\\" to recite a list of his qualifications, which included \\"Senior Professor of the Colombo South Government Hospital\\" (a claim debunked by the hospital itself) and \\"Professor at the Medicinal Alternative Open University in the USSR and Open University of Sri Lanka\\". In a series of promotional advertisements the same year, Zeng proclaimed himself to be a \\"Senior Professor Doctor Sir\\". Zeng attracted criticism for his unconventional behaviour. Certain acts of his in public \\"annoyed\\" some individuals; this included the playing of high-volume videos and Zeng's loud singing. Others opined that his acts provided some form of entertainment. Zeng reportedly was an avid boxer and a taekwando instructor. He was also interested in water sports; he owned a speed boat, in addition to Scat, a hovercraft made in America. In December 1991, Zeng was involved in an accident while on his leisure craft Yeeyew, which he had purchased for $80,000 as a tin jubilee gift for his wife. Items on the boat valued at tens of thousands of dollars were lost to the sea. Zeng was hospitalised for a short period following the incident. In February 2013, Zeng sustained a rib fracture and internal bleeding after a traffic collision. Zeng sued the owner of the van involved, OJJ Foods, and the matter was settled out of court in December 2014.Zeng Guoyuan @ Chan Hock Seng v. Ong Joo Joo Food Industries Pte Ltd [2014] State Courts (Singapore) In 2014, Zeng underwent surgery to remove his nose, due to terminal nasopharynx cancer; in spite of that, the cancer metastasised, and Zeng had a portion of his large intestine removed shortly afterwards. His thyroid and salivary glands were also removed for unspecified reasons. Heavy in debt, he mortgaged his house in May 2015. He peddled tissue paper outside a Chinese temple at Queen Street until late 2016. Travelling about on a three-wheeler he bought in 1995, Zeng began frequenting Geylang Serai and Ngee Ann City in 2017. He resided with his wife at a \\"jumbo flat\\" (comprising two units) in Geylang Bahru until it was destroyed by a fire in September 2017. = Religious beliefs = While on the 1991 campaign trail, Zeng stated his religion as Roman Catholicism. In April 2011, Zeng announced that he was a Muslim and had adopted an Islamic name, Muhammad Ali. Whilst the trial of Kong Hee was underway, Zeng endorsed him as a \\"good preacher\\" capable of \\"bring(ing) people to the Lord\\", adding that he was a Christian who had donated large amounts of money to City Harvest and attended many church sessions. In addition, Zeng claimed to still be partly Buddhist and that he visited Buddhist temples on a regular basis. When asked for clarification on his religion, Zeng said: In a 2017 interview, Zeng identified himself as both a Muslim and a Jehovah's Witness, and described the unfortunate happenings in his life as divine salvation. Legal troubles In 1981, Zeng was fined $400 for an advertisement of his which was against the law. In March 1987, Zeng was found guilty of publishing a newspaper advertisement which advertised his piles and pain treatment services ‚Äì a breach of the Singapore Medical Act. He was fined $1,500. In March 1988, a clerk filed a lawsuit against Zeng, attesting that he had \\"kissed her and touched her breast in his clinic\\" during a hair-loss and weight-gain treatment session in November 1986. Zeng countered that the accuser was merely making use of him to get her \\"jealous\\" boyfriend's attention, labelling the case as an \\"extortion bid\\". He was found guilty and fined $2,000, but the conviction was rescinded in March 1990, following an appeal by Zeng. In December 1991, the owner of a white Mercedes-Benz limousine lodged a complaint against Zeng for not having paid for his vehicle, which he rented in November of that year, during the General Election. Initially refusing to pay, he later complied and no charges were filed. In June 1994, Zeng was charged with assaulting and threatening two male individuals, a claim which he initially refuted. The victims were his neighbours, and one of them was businessman Ho Peng Keong. Zeng was ordered to pay a fine of $4,000. In April 1996, another female patient of his claimed that Zeng had outraged her modesty at a treatment session at his acupuncture centre. During the trial, Zeng refused to settle in court, repeatedly stating that he was a \\"knight of Saint John\\"; the claim was found to be untrue. His antics were likened by a police officer at scene to that of a \\"Shakespearean\\" actor. Maintaining his innocence to the end, Zeng was nonetheless found guilty and sentenced to four strokes of the cane and some eighteen months of jail time, which was increased to ten strokes of the cane and twenty-seven months of imprisonment following a failed appeal. Zeng had claimed in his defence that the \\"nasty\\" victim was spitefully making up lies after he rejected her. Efforts on his part to postpone the sentencing, on the grounds that he was mentally disabled, were unsuccessful. It was noted that Zeng's antics in court were \\"aggravating factor[s] that the Court could take into account in sentencing\\". During that period in jail, Zeng alleged that he was stripped of some of his basic rights; he claimed that as a result of being denied access to clean bathing water, he had developed painful rashes near his rectum. He added that the police in charge of him called him crazy and wanted to \\"put him in a psychiatric cell\\", and also accused them of forcing him to confess through physical means. In 2008, Zeng was charged with using abusive language on two police officers. He was found guilty of violating section 13(D) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act and fined $2,500; it was reinforced in Public Prosecutor v Zeng Guoyuan [2008] that \\"the tariff for using abusive/threatening language or behaviour is a fine of $3,000\\". In around October 2009, a lawsuit was filed against Zeng for placing at his two stores banners of escaped terrorist Mas Selamat bin Kastari ‚Äì which he argued were merely sunshades ‚Äì without official permit. The banners were accompanied by large one-word notes all reading \\"Death\\". The trial concluded with Zeng deciding to spend three weeks in jail, instead of paying $3,000 in fines. The management of Ngee Ann City \\"called the police more than 30 times\\" in early 2017, alleging that Zeng was \\"masquerading as a cripple to sell tissue-paper packs\\"; Zeng countered that they were simply \\"not happy\\" and \\"jealous\\" and dismissed their allegations as \\"nonsense\\". Additionally, a notice urging passers-by not to donate to Zeng was put up by the mall. Zeng was charged with begging, using abusive language on a police officer, and assaulting a Ngee Ann City security officer. In August 2018, Zeng was arrested for disorderly behaviour in Orchard Road. Two months later, he was arrested in Geylang Serai for assaulting two police officers. In October 2018, former police officer Seah Chin Peng was charged in a district court for deliberately damaging Zeng's walking stick two years ago and attempting to suppress the truth behind its destruction. Death Zeng was found dead at the void deck of 68 Geylang Bahru on 16 November 2019 at 21:45 (GMT+8). The cause of death was not immediately known. Zeng's neighbour recounted being awoken by a loud thud and found Zeng lying motionless in a pool of blood. Bibliography * Why The World Trade Centre Collapse So So Fast?

When Javier proposes to Trish, Trish runs upstairs and locks herself in Manny's room. Gloria tries to talk to her and convince her to come out.

Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave an A- grade to the episode saying that the episode was made only to make you laugh. \\"‚ÄúFlip Flop‚Äù seems like the kind of episode that gets made when the creative team doesn't think they can fail. It's full of broad gags and muttered asides and old-fashioned farce. It isn't concerned with appealing to desirable demographics or pushing envelopes. It's the kind of episode that gets made when the only thing the creative team wants to do is make each other laugh.\\" Victoria Leigh Miller from Yahoo! TV said that the episode was hilarious and truly memorable. \\"It was guest stars galore on Wednesday night's \\"Modern Family\\" when the family flipped out over a flipped house and a new female friend.

[...] Everything about it was just so on point and hysterical, not to mention Rob Riggle was a guest star.\\" Wyner C of Two Cents TV gave a good review to the episode saying it was \\"cute\\" and it ended the house flipping story arc. \\"Families support each other through it all ‚Äì they are our walking sticks.

Written at the beginning of the 12th century, it is a collection of fables and tales and is the oldest European book of its kind.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/307197/Judaism/35340/Sources- and-development?anchor=ref299776 Works in Disciplina Clericalis Works included in the book are: =The Half Friend= An Arab who is dying calls his son to him and asks him how many friends he thinks he has gained in his lifetime. The son estimates the number to be around 100. The father replies that he only considers people his friends until they have proved their friendship. He then tells his son to test his friends by bringing them a dead calf cut in pieces in a sack and bring it to each of his friends telling them that he has killed a man and he needs them to help him hide the body. All of his friends refuse to help him and break off their friendships with him. The father then tells the son to go to his \\"half friend\\" and see what he will say. The son does this and the \\"half friend\\" agrees and begins preparations. Upon seeing this, son informs the \\"half friend\\" of the truth and thanks him. Afterward the son asks the father if he has ever known someone who had a \\"perfect friend\\". The father replies that he has and begins to tell the story. =The Perfect Friend= The story opens with two merchants, one living in Baghdad and the other in Egypt, who know each other through hearsay. One day, the one from Baghdad happens to have business in Egypt and travels there. He is welcomed to stay at the house of the other merchant but suddenly falls ill. The other merchant, who is hosting him, calls in the most experienced doctors in Egypt who diagnose him with lovesickness. Upon request, his host brings him all the women of his household, starting with the chamber maids and singing girls and then his daughters, to see if they are the object of his sickness. When none of these are of interest to the sick merchant, his host brings him a girl of noble birth who he is hoping to marry someday. When the sick merchant sees this girl he tells his host that 'she is the one who means life and death to me'. Upon hearing this the host gives the girl to the sick merchant who recovers and after finishing his business goes back to Baghdad. Some time later the merchant from Egypt loses all his wealth and becomes a beggar. He travels to Baghdad to see his friend, however he arrives at an inconvenient time in the middle of the night. He does not go to his friends house for fear of being recognized and instead decides to spend the night in a mosque. While he is there he overhears one man kill another. There is an alarm and the citizens flock to the mosque. They find the Egyptian who confesses to the crime so that he can commit suicide. The following morning he brought to the gallows and is about to be hanged when the other merchant sees him and confesses to the crime to save his friends life. The real murderer sees this and decides to confess to the crime so that he can escape a worse judgement from God later on. The judges are confused by this and decide to take the case before the king. After having a council they decide to set all three men at liberty if they will tell how the event came to pass. They do and are set at liberty. After this the merchant from Baghdad lets the other merchant into his house as a guest and offers to allow him to stay and share his wealth. However the merchant from Egypt wants to go back to his homeland and so the merchant from Baghdad give him half of his goods and he returns to his own land. On hearing this, the son of the dying Arab remarks 'it is scarcely likely that a man could find such a friend'. =The Three Poets= Three different poets go to present poetry to a king. The first is an Arab of lowly birth and high abilities. The king rewards him richly when he hears his poetry. When other poets malign him for being of lowly birth the king rewards him even more when he tells the maligners 'no one blames the rose because it springs from amongst thorny thickets'. The second poet who comes before the king is of noble birth but lesser abilities. When the king hears his poetry he does not give him a gift. The poet then asks for a gift for being noble. On hearing this the king asks the poet who his father is. Upon discovering the identity of the poets father the king tells the poet 'his seed has degenerated in you'. The third poet who appears before the king has a noble mother but a lesser father and is not of great abilities. When the king hears this poet he again asks who the father is. The poet is ashamed to mention his father and so speaks to the king of his uncle who possesses great skill and wit. Upon observing this the king roars with laughter. When he is asked why he begins to tell a story. =The Mule and the Fox= The king tells his courtiers he is laughing because the situation reminds him of a story he read in a book of fables. At their request he tells the story: A young mule and a fox are in a pasture together. The fox is intrigued by the mule and asks who he is. The mule replies that he is one of gods creatures. The fox then asks the mule if he has a mother and a father. The mule, unwilling to admit that his father is a donkey says, 'my mother's brother is a noble steed'. After telling this story, the king compares the third poet to the mule who was ashamed of his father because he was a donkey and asks the poet who his father is. When the king sees the poet's father he recognizes him as being a lowly and uneducated man. On seeing this the king says of this poet 'give him something from our treasury, for the seed has not degenerated in him'. =The Man and the Serpent= A man walking through a field finds a snake which has been tied up by shepherds. The man frees the snake and brings it back to life by warming it. As soon as the snake comes back to life it attacks the man by winding itself around him. When the man asks him why he is repaying the good that has been done him with evil the snake replies that it is his nature. The man argues with the snake and a fox is called upon to judge the matter. The fox first has the snake tied back up and tells it to escape if it can. The fox then tells the man that he cannot change the natural order of things using an analogy of a weight that falls when its supports are removed. =The Hunchback and the Poet= A poet presents a pleasing poem before the king and is rewarded with a gift of his choosing. He asks the king if he may be permitted to sit at the gate and to ask one dinar from every person with a deformity (hunchbacked, one-eyed, leprous, etc.). One day a hunchback comes by wearing a hooded cloak and holding a staff. The poet asks him for a dinar and he refuses at which point the poet rips off his hood revealing that he has only one eye. The poet, still holding onto the man's hood, asks for two dinars. The man tries to run and his hood is ripped off revealing a rash and he is asked for three dinars. The hunchback tries to resist by force and thus reveals his arms and it becomes apparent that he has impetigo. He is asked for a fourth dinar. During the struggle his cloak is also torn revealing that he has a hernia. This causes the poet to solicit a fifth dinar from him. The moral of the story is that as a result of the hunchbacks struggling he is required to pay five dinars when he could have only paid one. =The Two Clerks who Entered a Tavern= Two learned men are out on a walk and approach a gathering area of drinkers. The first argues that they ought to divert their course away from the area to avoid becoming involved with evil men. The other does not agree saying that it cannot hurt to pass through, and they do not alter their course. While they are passing the second man is overpowered by a song which he hears and is held back. His companion leaves him and he decides to enter a tavern to drink. Meanwhile a prefect of the city follows a spy into the tavern. This prefect realizes that the tavern is the abode of the spy and arrests all of the men inside of the tavern for being accomplices. =The Voice of the Screech Owl= Two students are walking along and come to a place where they hear a beautiful voice belonging to a woman. One of them stops to listen and is urged to continue by his friend who says \\"Whoever hears the song of the bird and is bewitched thereby, he must surely die\\". The first student remarks that the voice which they had heard was more beautiful than the one he heard with his teacher earlier. He then goes on to tell his friend about the voice which he had heard earlier. This voice was repetitive and discordant and the student marvels that his teacher found pleasure in it. The teacher remarks that man finds joy in his voice, poetry, and son even if they are not pleasing to him. Then the two students depart. =The Vintner= A vintner goes out in his field and while he is gone his wife calls her lover to her. However her husband returns unexpectedly because of an injury to his eye. The wife hides her lover under the bed and goes to meet her husband. When he asks to have his bed prepared the wife, worried that he will discover her lover, asks what is ailing him. He tells her of the injury to his eye and she tells him that she must lay a charm on the good eye so that the same thing will not befall it as well. He agrees to this and the wife kisses his eye until her lover is safely out of the house. =The Linen Sheet= A man goes travelling and leaves his wife with his mother-in-law. His wife loves another and tells her mother who approves. While they are eating with this lover, the husband returns unexpectedly. The wife hides her lover and lets her husband in. He asks to have his bed prepared. The wife is unsure how to handle this request so the mother steps in and distracts the man with a fine linen sheet and the lover sneaks out of the house. =The Sword= A man goes travelling and leaves his wife with his mother-in-law. The mother in law approves of the wife's secret lover and invites him to a banquet. While they are eating the husband returns and knocks on the door. Having no place to hide the lover, the mother-in-law gives him a sword and tells him to stand by the door. When the husband asks the meaning of this the mother-in-law replies that the man was running from three men who were trying to kill him and that they had given him refuge. She further informs the husband that the lover had thought the husband was one of these pursuers and for this reason had not addressed him. The husband is impressed by this and makes the man eat with him and comforts him before letting him go. =The King and his Story-teller= =The Weeping Puppy Dog= =The Well= =The Ten Chests= =The Oil Vat= =The Golden Serpent= =The Footpath= =The Two Townsfolk and the Countryman= =Nedui the Pupil of the Royal Taylor= =The Two Minstrels= =The Countryman and the Little Bird= =The Oxen Which the Countryman had Promised to the Wolf, and the Judgment of the Fox= =The Thief and the Ray of Moonlight= =The Philosopher Marianus= =The Two Brothers and the Budget of the King= =The Servant Maimundus= =The Story of Socrates and the King= =The Prudent Son of the Royal Wazir= =The Thief who Wanted to Take Too Much= =The Shepherd and the Cattle Dealer= =The Learned Man Passing Through the Grave-Yard= =The Golden Grave of Alexander= =The Hermit who Prepared his Soul for Death= The Book also contains a prologue and an epilogueOn Google Books References =Translation= * Petrus Alfonsi; Hulme, William Henry. \\"Disciplina Clericalis (English translation) from the fifteenth century Worcester Catherdral Manuscript F. 172\\".

Peter Sadler analysed what structure you would expect in a stratigraphic section under the hypothesis that bigger geological events ‚Äì episodes of deposition, erosion, and the gaps between those events ‚Äì are rarer. He showed that under these conditions it is inevitable that, on average, thinner stratigraphic sections, which cover shorter amounts of time, record faster accumulation rates than thicker sections, which record longer amounts of time.Schumer, Rina, Douglas Jerolmack, and Brandon McElroy. \\"The stratigraphic filter and bias in measurement of geologic rates.\\" Geophysical Research Letters 38.11 (2011): L11405.Schumer, Rina, and Douglas J. Jerolmack. \\"Real and apparent changes in sediment deposition rates through time.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface (2003‚Äì2012) 114.F3 (2009). The effect equivalently states that more ancient packages of sediment in the stratigraphic record will record slower sedimentation rates stretched over longer periods of time. For instance, it explains the fact that in general, the more ancient geological periods of the Phanerozoic are longer than the more recent ones; i.e., the periods of the Palaeozoic are much longer than those in the Cenozoic. Conversely, it also explains that the maximum sediment accumulation rates seen in the Cambrian at the start of the Phanerozoic are almost two orders of magnitude lower than those observed in the Quaternary, at its end. The Sadler effect provides a powerful framework for understanding how information extracted from any given stratigraphic section differs from what should be expected under constant conditions ‚Äì that is, it provides a null hypothesis for analysing stratigraphy. It also provides techniques to estimate the completeness of a given stratigraphic section on a given timescale. Sections are less complete at shorter timescales, which means that at sufficiently short timescales and for some purposes, some sedimentary successions may contain essentially no useful information.

K-SVD is a generalization of the k-means clustering method, and it works by iteratively alternating between sparse coding the input data based on the current dictionary, and updating the atoms in the dictionary to better fit the data. K-SVD can be found widely in use in applications such as image processing, audio processing, biology, and document analysis.  Problem description  The goal of dictionary learning is to learn an overcomplete dictionary matrix D \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times K} that contains K signal-atoms (in this notation, columns of D). A signal vector y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} can be represented, sparsely, as a linear combination of these atoms; to represent y, the representation vector x should satisfy the exact condition y = Dx, or the approximate condition y \\\\approx Dx, made precise by requiring that \\\\y - Dx\\\\_p \\\\le \\\\epsilon for some small value and some norm. The vector x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{K} contains the representation coefficients of the signal y. Typically, the norm p is selected as , , or . If n < K and D is a full-rank matrix, an infinite number of solutions are available for the representation problem. Hence, constraints should be set on the solution. Also, to ensure sparsity, the solution with the fewest nonzero coefficients is preferred. Thus, the sparsity representation is the solution of either : (P_0) \\\\quad \\\\min \\\\limits _x \\\\x\\\\_0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{subject to } y = Dx or : (P_{0, \\\\epsilon}) \\\\quad \\\\min \\\\limits _x \\\\x\\\\_0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{subject to } \\\\y - Dx\\\\_2 \\\\le \\\\epsilon where the \\\\x\\\\_0 counts the nonzero entries in the vector x. (See the zero \\"norm\\".)  K-SVD algorithm  K-SVD is a kind of generalization of K-means, as follows. The k-means clustering can be also regarded as a method of sparse representation. That is, finding the best possible codebook to represent the data samples \\\\\\\\{y_i\\\\\\\\}^M_{i=1} by nearest neighbor, by solving : \\\\quad \\\\min \\\\limits _{D, X} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\Y - DX\\\\^2_F\\\\\\\\} \\\\qquad \\\\text{subject to } \\\\forall i, x_i = e_k \\\\text{ for some } k. which is equivalent to : \\\\quad \\\\min \\\\limits _{D, X} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\Y - DX\\\\^2_F\\\\\\\\} \\\\qquad \\\\text{subject to }\\\\quad \\\\forall i , \\\\x_i\\\\_0 = 1 . The letter F denotes the Frobenius norm. The sparse representation term x_i = e_k enforces K-means algorithm to use only one atom (column) in dictionary D. To relax this constraint, the target of the K-SVD algorithm is to represent signal as a linear combination of atoms in D. The K-SVD algorithm follows the construction flow of the K-means algorithm. However, in contrary to K-means, in order to achieve a linear combination of atoms in D, the sparsity term of the constraint is relaxed so that the number of nonzero entries of each column x_i can be more than 1, but less than a number T_0. So, the objective function becomes : \\\\quad \\\\min \\\\limits _{D, X} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\Y - DX\\\\^2_F \\\\\\\\} \\\\qquad \\\\text{subject to } \\\\quad \\\\forall i \\\\;, \\\\x_i\\\\_0 \\\\le T_0. or in another objective form : \\\\quad \\\\min \\\\limits _{D, X} \\\\sum_{i} \\\\x_i\\\\_0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{subject to } \\\\quad \\\\forall i \\\\;, \\\\Y - DX\\\\^2_F \\\\le \\\\epsilon. In the K-SVD algorithm, the D is first fixed and the best coefficient matrix X is found. As finding the truly optimal X is impossible, we use an approximation pursuit method. Any algorithm such as OMP, the orthogonal matching pursuit can be used for the calculation of the coefficients, as long as it can supply a solution with a fixed and predetermined number of nonzero entries T_0. After the sparse coding task, the next is to search for a better dictionary D. However, finding the whole dictionary all at a time is impossible, so the process is to update only one column of the dictionary D each time, while fixing X. The update of the k-th column is done by rewriting the penalty term as : \\\\Y - DX\\\\^2_F = \\\\left\\\\ Y - \\\\sum_{j = 1}^K d_j x^j_T\\\\right\\\\^2_F = \\\\left\\\\ \\\\left(Y - \\\\sum_{j e k} d_j x^j_T \\\\right) - d_k x^k_T \\\\right\\\\^2_F = \\\\ E_k - d_k x^k_T\\\\^2_F where x^k_T denotes the k-th row of X. By decomposing the multiplication DX into sum of K rank 1 matrices, we can assume the other K-1 terms are assumed fixed, and the k-th remains unknown. After this step, we can solve the minimization problem by approximate the E_k term with a rank -1 matrix using singular value decomposition, then update d_k with it. However, the new solution of vector x^k_T is very likely to be filled, because the sparsity constraint is not enforced. To cure this problem, Define \\\\omega_k as : \\\\omega_k = \\\\\\\\{i \\\\mid 1 \\\\le i \\\\le N , x^k_T(i) e 0\\\\\\\\}, which points to examples \\\\\\\\{ y_i \\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^N that use atom d_k (also the entries of x_i that is nonzero). Then, define \\\\Omega_k as a matrix of size N\\\\times\\\\omega_k, with ones on the (i,\\\\omega_k(i))\\\\text{-th}, entries and zeros otherwise. When multiplying x_R^k = x^k_T\\\\Omega_k, this shrinks the row vector x_T^k by discarding the zero entries. Similarly, the multiplication Y^R_k = Y\\\\Omega_k is the subset of the examples that are current using the d_k atom. The same effect can be seen on E^R_k = E_k\\\\Omega_k. So the minimization problem as mentioned before becomes : \\\\ E_k\\\\Omega_k - d_k x^k_T\\\\Omega_k\\\\^2_F = \\\\ E^R_k - d_k x^k_R\\\\^2_F and can be done by directly using SVD. SVD decomposes E^R_k into U\\\\Delta V^T. The solution for d_k is the first column of U, the coefficient vector x^k_R as the first column of V \\\\times \\\\Delta (1, 1). After updating the whole dictionary, the process then turns to iteratively solve X, then iteratively solve D. Limitations Choosing an appropriate \\"dictionary\\" for a dataset is a non-convex problem, and K-SVD operates by an iterative update which does not guarantee to find the global optimum. However, this is common to other algorithms for this purpose, and K-SVD works fairly well in practice.

The algorithm can be used in various applications such as object removal from images, reshuffling or moving contents of images, or retargeting or changing aspect ratios of images, optical flow estimation, or stereo correspondence. Algorithm The goal of the algorithm is to find the patch correspondence by defining a nearest- neighbor field (NNF) as a function f : \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^2 of offsets, which is over all possible matches of patch (location of patch centers) in image A, for some distance function of two patches D. So, for a given patch coordinate a in image A and its corresponding nearest neighbor b in image B, f(a) is simply b - a. However, if we search for every point in image B, the work will be too hard to complete. So the following algorithm is done in a randomized approach in order to accelerate the calculation speed. The algorithm has three main components. Initially, the nearest-neighbor field is filled with either random offsets or some prior information. Next, an iterative update process is applied to the NNF, in which good patch offsets are propagated to adjacent pixels, followed by random search in the neighborhood of the best offset found so far. Independent of these three components, the algorithm also use a coarse-to-fine approach by building an image pyramid to obtain the better result. =Initialization= When initializing with random offsets, we use independent uniform samples across the full range of image B. This algorithm avoids using an initial guess from the previous level of the pyramid because in this way the algorithm can avoid being trapped in local minima. =Iteration= After initialization, the algorithm attempted to perform iterative process of improving the NNF. The iterations examine the offsets in scan order (from left to right, top to bottom), and each undergoes propagation followed by random search. =Propagation= We attempt to improve f(x,y) using the known offsets of f(x-1, y) and f(x, y-1), assuming that the patch offsets are likely to be the same. That is, the algorithm will take new value for f(x,y) to be \\\\arg \\\\min \\\\limits _{(x,y)} {D(f(x, y)), D(f(x - 1, y)), D(f(x, y - 1))}. So if f(x, y) has a correct mapping and is in a coherent region R, then all of R below and to the right of f(x, y) will be filled with the correct mapping. Alternatively, on even iterations, the algorithm search for different direction, fill the new value to be \\\\arg \\\\min \\\\limits _{(x,y)} \\\\\\\\{D(f(x, y)), D(f(x + 1, y)), D(f(x, y + 1))\\\\\\\\}. =Random search= Let v_0 = f(x, y), we attempt to improvef(x, y) by testing a sequence of candidate offsets at an exponentially decreasing distance from v_0 : u_i = v_0+w\\\\alpha^iR_i where R_i is a uniform random in [-1, 1] \\\\times [-1, 1], w is a large window search radius which will be set to maximum picture size, and \\\\alpha is a fixed ratio often assigned as 1/2. This part of the algorithm allows the f(x,y) to jump out of local minimum through random process. =Halting criteria= The often used halting criteria is set the iteration times to be about 4~5. Even with low iteration, the algorithm works well. Conclusion This is an efficient algorithm since it only takes a few second on a testing computer with Intel Core i5 CPU and Photoshop CS5.

From there, a light carbon ink and colour pigments were used to create the image, which would have been copied from a smaller-scale version.  Movement  During the 1920s, the various armies of the Chinese warlords would often plunder small villages in search of valuable goods. Fearing The Paradise of Maitreya was in danger of theft, the monks of Xinghua Si removed the work from the wall and partitioned it into 63 pieces so that it could be securely stored and hidden in Taiyuan. While the painting survived the plundering, it faced environmental threats from fire and draught in its new location. Instead of allowing the work to undergo further degradation, the monks began approaching art dealers, hoping to sell it. In 1928, Anglican Bishop William White (Bishop of Honan) heard of the sale and proceeded to purchase the painting. Over the following 5-year period, the piece was shipped from Taiyuan to Tianjin, then taken via American Express to Boston, and from there was taken to Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum by train.  Restoration at the Royal Ontario Museum  While the painting suffered notable damage following its removal from the Xinghua si monastery, restoration efforts made by the ROM have led The Paradise of Maitreya to become one of the best preserved pieces from the Yuan dynasty. = Initial restoration = Restoration on the piece commenced in 1933 with structural treatment to reassemble the 63 panels the painting was partitioned into. During the work's movement, a significant amount of degradation had occurred, causing loss and disfigurement. After the initial restoration was completed, George Stout mounted the painting on the north wall of the ROM's Bishop White Gallery. It was placed on Masonite panels developed at the Fogg Art Museum using a polyvinyl acetate resin. = Renaissance ROM = As part of a museum-wide restoration effort put on by the ROM in 2005, The Paradise of Maitreya received further attention addressing surface and structural issues. Plastazote LD45 was used to undertake general breakdowns in the joint material of the Masonite panels for its flexibility and imperviousness to humidity.  Dating  While The Paradise of Maitreya arrived in the ROM in 1933, it wasn't until 1940 when Bishop William C. White became the first to propose a date for the painting. A team of students commissioned by White discovered the painting appeared to bear an inscription dictating it was completed on the 14th day of the mid-autumn moon of qingshen. White believed this gave an age that was too young for the painting and that his students had therefore interpreted the inscription incorrectly. Instead, he believed the inscription read the painting was completed in wuzu, not qingshen, which he claimed would date it to be from 1238.Steinhardt, \\"A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Daoist Style\\", \\"Artibus Asiae, 48, 1, 5-38\\", 1987 Ludwig Bachhofer later researched the painting and found an additional inscription quoting ‚Äúda Yuan guo‚Äù (the great Yuan state). As this title was not used in Yuan until 1271, it made the painting's date of 1238 inaccurate. He agreed that the painting bore the inscription wuzu, not qingshen, however, as these characters were reused on a 60-year cycle, he instead believed the term wuzu was referring to the year 1298. = Controversy = As most of the painting's inscriptions were not transported to the ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, it is impossible to get a full record of the painting's background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on the painting's date. As such, The Paradise of Maitreya remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.Tsang, \\"Further Observations on the Yuan Wall Painter Zhu Haogu and the Relationship of the Chunyang Hall Wall Paintings to The Maitreya Paradise at the ROM\\", \\"Artibus Asiae, 52, 1, 94-118\\", 1992 See also *Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru  References  Category:Chinese paintings Category:Buddhist art Category:Collections of the Royal Ontario Museum Category:Murals Category:Maitreya ","title":"Paradise of Maitreya"},{"id":"39799383","text":"Hoplunnis megista is an eel in the family Nettastomatidae (duckbill/witch eels).Hoplunnis megista at www.fishbase.org.

It stars Hugh Grant as a washed-up screenwriter who begins teaching at a state university and Marisa Tomei as a single mother with whom the screenwriter finds romance. It began development at Castle Rock Entertainment in October 2012, and filming began in New York in April 2013. The Rewrite premiered at a gala screening at the Shanghai International Film Festival on , 2014. The theatrical release in the United States was on February 13, 2015. Plot summary Keith Michaels (Hugh Grant) is a divorced, washed-up screenwriter whose only successful work was Paradise Misplaced, which won the Best Screenplay Award fifteen years ago. Desperate and low on funds after a prolonged period of unsuccessful pitching, he reluctantly takes up a job teaching screenwriting at Binghamton University in upstate New York. Things do not go well for Keith in the beginning; he unintentionally insults fellow professor Mary Weldon (Allison Janney) with his awkward sense of humor; he strikes up a brief relationship with student Karen Gabney (Bella Heathcote) which turns sour quickly. Keith also does not believe in the concept of teaching and is uninterested in his job, as exemplified by his selecting students for his class based on appearance and dismissing them for a month. After being overtly contested by a resentful Karen about his competence, Keith starts to devote more time and effort to coaching his students and helping them discover their passion and improve their writing; he especially finds great potential in Clem Ronson (Steven Kaplan), a sickly and socially awkward nerd, whose script quickly garners the interest of Keith‚Äôs agent, Elle. Keith also forms a bond with mature student Holly Carpenter (Marisa Tomei), a single mother of two who is in a steady but dull relationship. The two of them often disagree on their perspectives on life, where Keith believes that nothing will salvage his stagnant career or mend his relationship with his estranged son Alex, whereas Holly maintains an optimistic outlook on life and believes that with effort, talents can be developed and problems can be solved. Despite their differences, Keith finds enlightenment in Holly‚Äôs advice and makes the first move in contacting Alex. However, Keith‚Äôs situation worsens when his outline for Paradise Misplaced II gets rejected and he faces expulsion from the school after his short-lived relationship with Karen is exposed. In deep despair, Keith gets into an argument with Holly and decides to leave the school. As a last parting gesture, he accompanies Clem to Manhattan to meet with some Hollywood film producers. Halfway through the meeting, Keith realizes how he has impacted his students and, leaving a newly empowered Clem to resume the meeting by himself, he heads back to Binghamton to save his job ‚Äî which he manages to do with a heartfelt conversation with Professor Weldon. In a revelation of his renewed perspective, Keith expresses admiration for Holly‚Äôs perseverance in life and confesses his love for her. He also declines Elle‚Äôs invitation to return to Hollywood, as he has decided to stay in Binghamton to teach and write a screenplay based on his experience there; and he tells Elle not to call during class hours. Keith is welcomed back by his students and reconciles with Karen. The film ends with Keith‚Äôs phone flashing with a voicemail from Alex.

The project began development at Castle Rock Entertainment. In October 2012, actor Hugh Grant was cast in the film's starring role. His casting marked the fourth collaboration between Lawrence, Castle Rock, and Grant. Their previous films were Two Weeks Notice, Music and Lyrics, and Did You Hear About the Morgans? \\"\\"I love Marc's stuff, and ['The Rewrite'] made me laugh,\\" he said. \\"[I wasn't interested] in the sort of marketed, Hallmark, 'Valentine's Day' sense ‚Äî I find that repugnant. Here, the romantic comedy part of it is only a small part; it's about this broken guy who mends himself.\\" In November 2012, actor Marisa Tomei entered negotiations to star opposite Grant. In the following March, Bella Heathcote joined the cast. Variety reported, \\"This film would give Heathcote some lighter material after breaking out in serious projects,\\" referring to In Time and Not Fade Away. Later in the month, Allison Janney, J. K. Simmons, and Chris Elliott joined the cast. Filming began in New York in April 2013. Release FilmNation Entertainment handled sales of The Rewrites distribution in territories outside the United States. The film premiered at a gala screening at the Shanghai International Film Festival on , 2014. Distributor Lionsgate scheduled the film to be released in theaters in the United Kingdom on , 2014. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 66%, based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Rewrite's unremarkable plot is enlivened considerably by its likable cast, adding up to a comedy that coasts capably on the charms of Hugh Grant and his co-stars.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating, the film has a score 51 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The Hollywood Reporters Elizabeth Kerr said The Rewrite was not groundbreaking as a romantic comedy but that \\"it is a pleasant diversion for fans of the form\\". Kerr considered the film an improvement from Did You Hear About the Morgans? (2009) and said while it was initially similar to Liberal Arts (2012) with \\"its aggressive academic and literary tone\\", it fell back on romantic comedy conventions. She found that Grant \\"embraces his maturity\\" as an older version of his typical character but that Tomei's character was \\"painfully underwritten\\". Kerr said the supporting characters would have been forgettable if the actors were not so strong.

Executive Yuan secretary-general =Thoughts on campaigning= In September 2007, Chen said that appointed government officials should concentrate to their own work rather than spend time campaigning for others. To cut down on the effect of constant campaigning, Chen announced that a new electoral system would be used after 10 October 2007. The first nationwide election to be affected by this change was the legislative election of 2008. It would utilize single-member districts and first-past-the-post voting. Additionally, the number of representatives elected to the Legislative Yuan was halved from 225 to 113. =Allegations of corruption= In April 2008, after the news that Huang Fu- yuan, the Director of Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) North Branch, allegedly committed bribery by handing out NT$20 million to ensure his promotion to the position of Vice President of Taipower, Economic Affairs Minister Steve Chen for the first time admitted in the Legislative Yuan that it was Chen Chin-jun who recommended Huang and that also many people were in support of the appointment. Chen however responded that although many people recommended Huang for the position, he only conveyed the message to the Ministry. In 2011, Chen and two others were found guilty of corruption for their actions in the 2008 legislative elections. The Taipei District Court ruled that Chen, former Veteran Affairs Commission Secretary-General Cha Tai-chen and then deputy defense minister Hu Chen-pu had accepted donations from RPTL International, Ltd., a company that the VAC owned. The money was used to fund four legislative candidates, Yu Tian, Lin Yu-fang, Huang Chung-yung, and Kao Chin Su-mei. Chen was sentenced to seven years and ten months in prison and denied public and electoral rights for three years. Deputy mayor of Taipei Ko Wen-je named Chen a deputy mayor of Taipei in February 2016, to replace Chou Li-fang, who had resigned. In October 2017, Chen announced that he would stand in the 2018 local elections to contest the New Taipei City mayoralty. Opinion polls showed that Chen had a low approval rating, and the Democratic Progressive Party eventually nominated Su Tseng-chang.

Shortly afterwards he married Agnes Boaden, against his parents' wishes. His writing career was not enough to earn a living. Soane fell into debt, and was imprisoned. In 1814 he was editing the Theatrical Inquisitor, but also served time for fraud. He gave evidence on the King's Bench Prison, from his experience of it, to a committee of enquiry in 1815. In The Champion during September 1815 Soane attacked his father's reputation as an architect, in two anonymous articles. His mother died shortly afterwards. These pieces led to a family rupture, and indirectly to the foundation of Sir John Soane's Museum. Soane attempted to block the private Act of Parliament of 1833 that set up the museum's endowment. The matter was debated in the House of Commons for an hour, with William Cobbett putting Soane's side of the argument, that he would be deprived of a rightful inheritance.

Despair and abandonment are prominent in her three volumes. Biography and poetry She was a daughter of Sir James Carnegie, 5th Baronet (1799‚Äì1849) and Charlotte Lysons.

She was widowed in 1864. A few years later, she published her first volume of poetry, Stella, and other poems (1867), under the pseudonym \\"Florenz\\". The eponymous poem in the collection, \\"Stella\\", is set in the Italian Peninsula and features the doomed love of Count Marone and Stella. He is a man seeking Italian unification, she a daughter of the Neapolitan aristocracy, which is resisting this cause. Her early death causes her lover to seek the perils of the battlefield in an attempt to distract his mind. The subject matter is similar to Maud (1855) by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Other poems in the collection seem to be focused on themes of \\"intense and painful experience\\". Examples are \\"Desolate\\", concerning the emotions of a person abandoned by a lover, and \\"The Prayer of the Penitent\\", dealing with experience of shame before God). In 1868, Charlotte married her second husband, Frederick Boileau Elliot, who was the fifth son of Admiral George Elliot (1784‚Äì1863) and Eliza Cecilia Ness. His father was a younger brother of Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 2nd Earl of Minto.Burke (1865), p. 769. A decade later, Charlotte published her second volume of poetry, Medusa, and other poems (1878), under her married name and dedicated to Frederick. The eponymous poem \\"Medusa\\" features the Medusa of Classical mythology, to whom it is sympathetic, noting the experiences of \\"days of despair\\" and \\"unspeakable woe\\" from the time of her transformation to her death at the hands of Perseus. The other poems in the collections are melancholic tales \\"on time, love and death\\". Charlotte died on 15 January 1880. A third volume of her poetry, Mary Magdalene and other poems (1880), was published posthumously. As she had requested, only fifty copies of this collection were printed. Her husband died on 23 December of the same year.

Meaning \\"milk hills\\", they run along a northwest to southeast direction, culminating at the pilgrimage centre of Tirupati.  Etymology  The name Palkonda translates into \\"milk hills\\", a combination of the Telugu words pƒÅl meaning milk and konda meaning hill. The name is attributed to the presence of pasture grounds in them.  Geographical extent  The Palkonda range has a southeast to northwest orientation and traverse the districts of Anantapur and Cudappah. These hills average 2,000 ft in elevation. The highest point of the range is at Buttaid where it reaches a height of 3,060 ft. A westward extension of the range in Anantapur forms the Seshachalam Hills.  Geology  The Palkonda hills are relict mountains that can be traced back to the Cambrian period. They have over the course of over 500 million years been eroded by the Penner river and its tributaries. The hills are largely composed of quartzite formations interspersed with lava and slate deposits.  Rivers  The Punchu and Cheyyeru are important rivers of this region and, along with the Chitravati and Papagni rivers, form a series of river basins that marks the middle course of the Penner river of which they are tributaries. There are several streams between the Palkonda and its parallel range Velikonda that have been dammed to irrigate the valleys between the ranges. Jowar and groundnut are the principal crops cultivated here.  Flora and fauna  There are teak forests in these hills and it is also a habitat of the highly endangered Jerdon's courser.  Human habitations  The sacred hill of Tirumala and temple town of Tirupati lies at the southeastern end of the Palkonda range. The Mumbai-Chennai railway line is an important transport artery that runs parallel to the hills through Guntakal and Renigunta.

He was a party to two cases of first impression relating to Domain Name registration.  Early life and education  Dennis Eric Toeppen grew up in Mount Prospect, Illinois. He graduated from Prospect High School in 1982 and enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, majoring in electrical engineering. He later changed his major to business, and graduated in 1987. Thereafter, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago.  Domain Registration & Trademark Litigation In 1995, Toeppen registered about 200 internet domain names including some which were similar to well known companies and popular trademarks. Some of them included panavision.com (Panavision), deltaairlines.com (Delta Air Lines), neiman-marcus.com (Neiman Marcus), eddiebauer.com (Eddie Bauer) and yankeestadium.com (New York Yankees). Some of these companies, like Delta Air Lines, paid Toeppen to acquire the domain names from him. In 1996, Panavision, a camera manufacturing company, sued Toeppen for trademark infringement instead of paying him $13,000 for the domain. In 1998, the court ruled that Toeppen had to relinquish the domain name to Panavision.Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 945 F. Supp. 1296 (C.D. Cal. 1996), aff'd, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998). In a similar case brought in 1996, Intermatic Inc., a timer manufacturing company, sued Toeppen rather than pay him $5,000 for the domain name intermatic.com. The court ruled that the domain be transferred to Intermatic but ruled Intermatic had not proven willful trademark infringement or unfair competition. Both the Panavision and Intermatic cases were matters of first impression for the U.S. Courts in dealing with trademarks and domain registrations. The practice of registering trademarked words as domains for sale to trademark holders became known as Cybersquatting, a term that was first used by a court in 1998. In November 1999, after the Panavision case had ended, and while Intermatic Inc. v. Toeppen was still pending, the United States gave trademark holders a cause of action against registrants of domain names containing trademarks, in the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act.  Bus transportation  In 1983, Toeppen founded Suburban Express to provide transportation from Urbana- Champaign and the surrounding area to Chicago. After waging an initial price war with rival Greyhound Lines, fares in competitive markets had been reduced, and Suburban Express' ticket sales in Urbana-Champaign equaled those of Greyhound by 1985. Toeppen also started Allerton Charter Coach, Inc., a charter bus company with three buses and four vans as of 2014. It operated as a subcontractor for Suburban Express. After sending a promotional email that stated \\"You won't feel like you're in China on our buses\\", Suburban Express was sued by the Illinois Attorney General in April 2018 for civil rights violations. The lawsuit was settled out of court by way of a consent decree which contained no finding or admission of wrongdoing.
