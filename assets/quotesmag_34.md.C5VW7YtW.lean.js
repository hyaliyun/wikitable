She was for some years a fashionable artist in London, working in oils, crayons, and miniature. From 1760 she exhibited almost annually with either the Incorporated Society of Artists, the Free Society of Artist, or the Royal Academy, sending chiefly portraits of ladies and children of the aristocracy, which she painted with much grace and refinement. Early life Read was born in Dundee, Scotland, on 3 February 1723, to Alexander and Elizabeth Read, and one of thirteen children of an affluent Forfarshire family. She may have received her education in Edinburgh. Her mother was the sister of Sir John Wedderburn, 5th Baronet of Blackness, who fought in the Jacobite rising of 1745, and whose daughters were cared for by Read after his execution.Miss Katherine Read, Court Paintress, A. Francis Steuart, The Scottish Historical Review, Vol. 2, No. 5 (Oct., 1904), pp. 38-46 (abstract) Artistic education in Paris and Rome When the war ended at the Battle of Culloden and with family friends fleeing to France, Read‚Äôs family was prompted to follow suit for their association and support of the Jacobite cause through her uncle. Through their connections of the gentry, they were given sanctuary in Paris that same year and introduced to the painter Robert Strange, who is speculated to be Read‚Äôs teacher and introduction into the French artistic sphere. There she studied other works of art and improved her skills with little hindrance or instruction; it would have been hard for her to have been accepted into an academy class as a woman, let alone a foreigner whose family had a price on their heads for aiding and supporting a cause against the King of England. This period was not to last, however, as she fled to Rome in 1750 along with a majority of the Jacobites that had sought refuge in Paris. While there, she became friends with members of the Roman Catholic Church, often commissioned to recreate master paintings in oil or pastel for those in high clerical positions. One of these faithful patrons, Cardinal Albani, allowed Read to copy some of the portraits he owned by Rosalba Carriera, which ultimately led the man to sit for her himself. Career and court commissions She remained in Rome until deciding to venture to England in 1753, with the blessing of Albani -who managed to help her keep face regardless of her family‚Äôs past alignment in the war. This era was not only filled with a healthy stream of patronage and commissions, as Read was communicating and submitting samples to the Society of Arts for their collection and approval of fixing pastels. However, her methods, when compared to those of Sebastien Jurine, were considered inferior as she used a different type of pastel than he. In 1764, Read was on the road back to Paris for commissioned portraits of Madame Elisabeth through the Dauphin. Her work was shown by the Free Society (1761-1768) and the Society of Artists (1760-1772), of which she became an honorary member in 1769 along with the two other female pastel artists, Mary Benwell and Mary Black, in response to the Royal Academy accepting Angelica Kauffman and Mary Moser into their respective fold. Later, after a failed petition to the king, Read left to join the Royal Academy and was expelled from the Society as consequence. Her London residence was in St. James's Place until 1766, when she moved to Jermyn Street. Later life and death New pastel artists rose into the public‚Äôs view and Read no longer commanded such a following. In 1771 she went to India to paint the portraits of the English officers living there. She was accompanied by her niece, Helena Beatson, a clever young artist, who there married, in 1777, (Sir) Charles Oakeley, baronet, later governor of Madras. She is reported as being in that country in 1775 and 1777, and as dying at sea near Madras. Her death is recorded as 15 December 1778. Works In 1763 she exhibited a portrait of Queen Charlotte with the infant Prince of Wales, and in 1765 one of the latter with his brother, Prince Frederick. On resuming her practice, Read settled in Welbeck Street. Many of her portraits were well engraved by Valentine Green and James Watson, and a pair of plates, by J. Finlayson, of the celebrated Gunning sisters, the Duchess of Argyll and the Countess of Coventry, remained popular.Thomson Willing, Some works by Read have at one time been attributed to Joshua Reynolds. A portrait of Lady Georgiana Spencer has been noted as one of her finest. Legacy Read's talent for portraiture was highly regarded in her day, and was the subject of an epistle by Tobias Smollett: > Let candid Justice our attention lead, > to the soft crayon of the graceful Read. and praised by William Hayley.

International Conference, 10‚Äì12 February 2011, New Delhi, India. Linkages between Agriculture, Nutrition and Health Agricultural products are not only sources of energy and nutrients, but also sources of fuel, medicine, fiber, and lumber. Agriculture as an activity is also the source of livelihood and income for much of the world‚Äôs population, especially those living in rural areas. For this reason, agriculture has a considerable, positive impact on health and nutrition.Hawkes, C. and M. Ruel. 2006. Understanding the Links between Agriculture and Health. 2020 Focus 13. Brief 1. Washington D.C.: IFPRI. On the downside, agriculture has many negative effects on health.

Focus H of the World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development According to WHO, around 1.1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water.World Health Organization. 2010. Health through safe drinking water and basic sanitation Other negative effects include health and environmental risks to producers and laborers by being exposed to bad weather, handling chemical and biological products, working long hours, or using dangerous agricultural machinery. Conversely, health and nutrition can also influence agriculture. Poor health affects farm productivity and household income, creating a vicious circle of poverty, food insecurity, and ill health. The Policy Consultation and Conference =Rationale= The goal of the policy consultation is to overcome the isolation of policymakers and practitioners working in the agriculture, nutrition, and health sectors and to leverage the strong interactions and synergies among these sectors. In view of the problems many poor countries face to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, the initiative hopes to consolidate information and build consensus for a joint action leveraging agriculture to improve nutrition and health.Leveraging Agriculture for Improving Nutrition and Health.

In speaking of his father during a 2009 interview, Hawley said, \\"I went to Jesuit and played rugby because my dad and all his friends played at Cal. From there he was my personal rugby guru. He couldn‚Äôt talk so he would write pages of notes on his take of the game and what I needed to do. After every game he would come over and ask me what I thought, then he would give his insights. He was a great teacher and coach.\\" Hawley's mother, Rita Currie, is from Phoenix, AZ. Hawley has a brother Garrett, who played for the San Francisco Golden Gate under-23 side.

It also includes the procedures for discovering and rewriting these scripts, to evolve people's perceptions and behaviors in their present romantic relationships. Teachworth's Psychogenetic System theories, which comprise a unique system of relationship counseling, were first developed in 1991 by Anne Teachworth, a Certified Gestalt Therapist, the Founder and Director of the Gestalt Institute of New Orleans since 1976. These theories and associated counseling techniques facilitate psychotherapeutic and/or practical resolutions to a romantic couple's relationship problems. The first step is to discover each partner's early childhood memories of their own parents' relationship behaviors. Next is realization about the personality traits inherited genetically from each parent. Hence the term \\"psycho\\" and \\"genetic\\" combined. One of the tools Anne Teachworth developed to survey her clients' childhood relationship programming is called \\"The Selection Test\\". It is a single page with divided sections to primarily list the qualities of each parent as they were with each other in that client's early childhood, and their relationship patterns. She allowed only ten minutes for each client to spontaneously fill this out in private with no input from their mate, in order to better mine their subconscious memories. Teachworth first wrote about her \\"Psychogenetics\\" theory about relationship counseling in \\"Three Couples Transformed\\" which was published as a chapter in the book A Living Legacy of Fritz and Laura Perls: Contemporary Case Studies edited by Bud Feder and Ruth Ronall (1997). Anne‚Äôs own relationship counseling method (and her Selection Test) is explained in depth in her own book on the subject, Why We Pick The Mates We Do, first published in 1997; now in its Seventh edition, revised in 2007. A Psychogenetics System therapeutic session has its own style, but is built upon elements of Transactional Analysis, Gestalt Therapy, Redecision Therapy, and Neurolinguistic Programming - all of which Anne had a strong training background in. Additionally, she trained therapists for many years, having co- instructed at times with Richard Bandler, Laura Perls, Joseph Zinker, Dan Blum, Violet Oaklander, Anne Ancelin Schutzenberger, Stella Resnick, Phyllis Jenkins, Leonard Ravich and others well known in the world psychotherapy community. Since Anne Teachworth's death in February 2012, her legacy utilizing the Psychogenetics System in relationship counseling continues through other proponents and The Gestalt Institute of New Orleans by her son Jeff Teachworth, also a Certified Psychogenetics Coach and a Certified Gestalt Therapist (see Gestalt-Institute.com.) Teachworth's theories suggest that as naive children we were imprinted at a semi-conscious level. Each of us stores a script of each of our two parents' patterns of perceiving and reacting to each other. Under stress, in the almost forgotten old child-memory part of our mind, that \\"script\\" becomes the most powerful \\"road-map\\" of how to act in a relationship, EVEN IF it is breaking it apart. Under stress, when the logical functions get frustrated, these old patterns of relationship interaction seem to be the only option for survival. Sometimes beneficial, sometimes faulty, these behaviors occur spontaneously. With this trance like phenomenon occurring on behalf of each partner at times of relationship stress, the results can be quite chaotic and painful. Psychogenetics suggests that for many individuals, later adult mate choosing can be highly influenced by their primal compulsion to find a relationship partner at any expense, even if unconsciously falling into having to roleplay one of the two spousal roles assimilated in their early childhood. These roles are termed your \\"Inner Mate Model\\" for the mate you pick; and your \\"Inner Adult Model\\" representing the role you play. Attraction is largely an unconscious process. Managing a relationship is largely not. As young adults we might experience a \\"magical firework\\" moment and become powerfully attracted on an unconscious level to someone who closely matches our pre-programmed \\"Inner Mate Model\\" - regardless of whether they are a properly productive mate for us. Once drawn through unconsciously driven attraction to a partner whom we have cast into one of our two parents' relationship roles, we can often become stuck into automatically reliving their old problems, escalating disagreements into arguments and worse. Note that many couples manage to have satisfactory relationships most of the time, sometimes because there were mostly positive personality factors in their parents' relationships for the roleplaying to copy from. It is when there were substantial negative factors that a relationship can have considerable turbulence; and those are the relationships that show up in the counseling office. Original to Psychogenetics is the observation reported by multiple clients of Teachworth's in her book, how from one marriage to another, the same adult can find their new partner playing the role they played in their previous marriage and realize they are now stuck in the other. One example: A person who was generally the \\"Topdog\\" in one relationship sometimes finds themselves more of the \\"Underdog\\" in their next relationship. The psychogentic practitioner strives to assist the clients' evolution through these experiences so they emerge from the childhood relationship trance and able to form fulfilling authentic relationships. Psychogenetics offers much insight into changing the commonly observed pattern of the same man or woman in multiple marriages always choosing ‚Äúthe same type of partner.‚Äù Psychogenetics modifies this to say: Our unconscious is unfairly programmed to replay either one of two spousal roles we naively learned in early childhood years, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THESE ROLES FUNCTION WELL OR POORLY. As adults our unconscious is strongly influenced to utilize these TWO reference points to pick marriage partners, but this can be reprogrammed so you can be your better, mature self and find relationship happiness. Genetic aspect Also original to Psychogenetics is the idea not only are \\"mommy's and daddy's\\" relationship style and habits imprinted in our unconscious; it's also possible and observable to find elements of the spousal habits of ancestral family generations imprinted on an individual's unconscious as well, due to a kind of transitive property.

The game focuses on controlling a small body of water that is utilized in its different states of matter to progress through the game's levels. Fluidity was released in North America on December 6, 2010 and in Europe on December 24, 2010. A sequel, Fluidity: Spin Cycle, was released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in December 2012. Gameplay Fluidity is a 2D puzzle game with platforming elements, in which the player takes control of a large pool of water. The pool is moved by holding the Wii Remote sideways and tilting it left or right, which tilts the game world, while shaking the Remote will cause the pool to bounce upwards. The player is tasked with exploring the pages of a magical encyclopedia known as the Aquaticus, which has been infected by a dark substance called the Influence. The player must acquire Rainbow Drops, usually done by surmounting obstacles and completing environmental puzzles, in order to purge the book of the Influence. The pool of water gains the ability to transform into two other states (a block of ice and a cloud of vapor) as the game progresses. The ice block can smash through barriers, weigh down switches and cling to objects, and the cloud can float around freely and expel gusts of wind, as well as electrify objects via a bolt of lightning. Some of the water can be lost due to damage from monsters and hazards, which results in a Game Over when all the water in reserve has been depleted, and can be restored by collecting water droplets. Development The idea of a physics-based 'water game' was originally conceived in 2005, shortly after the formation of Curve Studios. During a development interview, design director Jonathan Biddle discussed the concept in these terms: \\"Water is so universal...The basics of freezing water to make ice and boiling it to make steam are things that no one needs explaining to them. We thought that all of these elements could be brought together to make a great game with really unique mechanics, and when we saw the Wii Remote, we instantly saw how it could be done.\\"http://wiiware.nintendolife.com/news/2010/12/interviews_curve_studios_fluidity_hydroventure As the studio was busy with other projects, development on Fluidity did not begin until after the 2008 Game Developers Conference. During the convention, Curve Studios met with Masa Miyazaki and Azusa Tajima, two producers from Nintendo, who signed a publishing agreement following a pitch of the game idea. Biddle described that the Wii Remote was a natural fit for Fluidity, although he did explain that there had been difficulties in fine-tuning the responsiveness of the controls, particularly the jumping mechanism. Elsewhere, he cites the images in airline safety brochures as the inspiration for the visual style of the game. The music and sound FX for Fluidity were created by Richard Jacques, Allister Brimble, and Anthony Putson. Reception Fluidity garnered a largely positive critical reception.http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/fluidity Edge gave the game a score of 8/10, praising the simple idea behind the game and the fun it provides.Edge #223, January 2011 (Future PLC) IGN gave it an 8.5/10, calling it an \\"invigorating puzzle game that's easy on the eyes.\\" GameSpot also gave it an 8.5/10, with praise going to the charming graphics, superb level design and great additional features.

Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209 (1993), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court required that an antitrust plaintiff alleging predatory pricing must show not only changes in market conditions adverse to its interests, as a threshold matter, but must show on the merits that (1) the prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of its rival's costs, and (2) that the competitor had a reasonable prospect or a \\"dangerous probability\\" of recouping its investment in the alleged scheme. Holding An oligopoly's interdependent pricing may provide a means for achieving recoupment, and thus may form the basis of a primary- line injury claim. Predatory pricing schemes, in general, are implausible, and are even more improbable when they require coordinated action among several firms. They are least likely to occur where, as alleged here, the cooperation among firms is tacit, since effective tacit coordination is difficult to achieve. Since there is a high likelihood that any attempt by one oligopolist to discipline a rival by cutting prices will produce an outbreak of competition; and since a predator's present losses fall on it alone, while the later supracompetitive profits must be shared with every other oligopolist in proportion to its market share, including the intended victim. Ultimately, Justice Kennedy, held that: * There is no per se rule of nonliability under Robinson-Patman Act for predatory price discrimination when recoupment is alleged to take place through supracompetitive oligopoly pricing, but * Competitor's alleged below-cost sales of generic cigarettes through discriminatory volume rebates did not create competitive injury in violation of Robinson-Patman Act.

He invented devices that made plumbing fixtures more practical and started the American indoor toilet industry. Maddock was decorator for a set of White House tableware dishes for President Franklin Pierce.  Early life  Maddock was born in the Staffordshire area of England on April 1, 1818. He was the third child of nine in the family. William, the first child, died at an early age. His other siblings were: three brothers, John, William B., Henry; his four younger sisters were Sarah, Betsy, Mary and Jane. Maddock's father was Thomas Maddock, Sr. His mother was Mary Maddock (n√©e Crompton). His father was a decorator of fine china at the Davenport Pottery manufacturing firm as was his uncle, John Maddock Jr. Maddock worked at Davenport Pottery as a decorator while a teenager, under the supervision of his father and uncle.  Mid life  Maddock decorated dish for fish bones Maddock married Miss Honor Bossoms in 1844 at the age of 26. English pottery business opportunities were not available at the time so they decided to emigrate to America in 1847. Maddock started a business decorating dinnerware in New York with William Leigh, a friend that also emigrated to America contemporaneously. Maddock with Leigh started the first American china decorating shop. The concept of firing of decorated dinnerware was then unknown in America. Maddock obtained prominence by the decoration of dinner services for President Pierce at the White House in 1853. The St. Nicholas Hotel in New York City opened in the same year and the Maddock & Leigh firm decorated dinnerware for them. Maddock joined the thirteenth regiment of the national guard of New York during the American Civil War. After the war he became a sales agent in 1872 for 'Millington & Asthury,' manufacturers of porous tableware in Trenton, New Jersey. He became closely associated with their business affairs and on April 4, 1873, a new partnership was formed called 'Millington, Astbury & Maddock.' Millington left the firm to start his own pottery business and the 3-man partnership of 'Millington, Astbury & Maddock' became then the two-man partnership firm of 'Astbury & Maddock'. Maddock and his sons eventually took over this firm and renamed it Thomas Maddock & Sons.  Sanitary ware  American toilet \\"sanitary ware\\" Maddock believed that sanitary ware (non-porous china ware), then only imported in small quantities from England, could be made more favorably in America. He started experimenting with pottery formulas and firing techniques to develop this state-of-the-art technology. Initially his failure rate on batches of 50 pieces was typically 90%. Maddock eventually perfected the techniques to make vitrified glass surface pottery, sanitary ware (also called bathroom/toilet ware or water closet). Maddock then in the spring of 1873 set out to sell his sanitary pottery line. His salesman's display consisted of a sheet of dark gray muslin about the size of a bed sheet. When he went to call on a china dealer he assembled his salesman's samples in the center of the muslin sheet that laid on the floor. The samples were a 14-inch P. O. basin, a 14-inch C. O. basin, a 14-inch R. P. basin and a French closet. These items weighed about fifty pounds. He tied the four corners of the sheet together making a handle and carried the samples over his shoulder. With his improvised salesman's display he demonstrated to many dealers (a/k/a jobbers). His prospect area was New York City and Brooklyn. For over six months he visited dealers with no sales. It wasn't until the end of the year that he obtained a small order from Miller and Coates of New York City. Waeffelaer and Duysters followed with an order. Other jobbers then placed orders with Maddock. In 1876 'Astbury & Maddock' exhibited their white general use tableware and sanitary ware (a/k/a/ modern toilet) at the first World's Fair held in the United States. They won a medal for their unusual pottery. Maddock‚Äôs firm in Trenton lead the way in the new industry of American toilets. Trenton soon captured the majority of the American market for sanitary ware (indoor toilets), producing over eighty five percent of the national market.  Maddock's toilet device invention  Brass coupling invention Maddock improved the old fashion early nineteenth century plumbing method of connecting lead pipe to a toilet by inventing a brass coupling replacement. His 1880 invention allowed the plumbing to be directly connected to the earthenware china toilet. The old school method involved a porcelain horn extending from the flushing rim connecting to the sewer lead pipe and the whole contraption held together by strips of muslin and putty. His invention made a direct solid connection and was the state-of-the-art technology that went into the twentieth century.  Family  Maddock married Honora Bossom first. The children they had were William and John. Maddock married Isabella Smith Middleton second. The children they had were Harold, John, Charles, Archibald, Harry, Jannet, and Isabella.  Retirement and death  Maddock retired when he was 65 years old in 1883. He died in New Jersey on June 16, 1899.

Its original headquarters was in a suburb of the city of Kanazawa, and its troops were recruited primarily from communities in Ishikawa, and Toyama Prefectures. Action Initially assigned to the Japanese Northern China Area Army it was deployed to the Chinese mainland from 15 July 1938, serving as a garrison force in Xuzhou. In February 1939, it participated in fighting in Kahoku district of Hebei province. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Hisakazu Tanaka from 1940 to 1943 as part of the Japanese 12th Army, the division participated in counter-insurgency operations in Northern China as well as the Battle of South Shanxi in May 1941, and the subsequent Hundred Regiments Offensive. From November 1941, the division was transferred to the control of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and transferred to the Philippines, landing at Lingayen Gulf on 26 February 1942. After the completion of the Philippines Campaign, from December 1943, the division was sent to French Indochina under the control of the IJA 38th Army, Assigned to a garrison role in Hanoi, it remained in Indochina through the end of the Pacific war except for a brief period in late 1944 when it crossed back into China to participate in Operation Ichi-Go. The division played a critical role in the Japanese coup d'√©tat in French Indochina of March 1945, which resulted in the proclamation of the Empire of Vietnam independent from French rule. It remained as a garrison force in Hanoi until the surrender of Japan in August 1945. A number of its troops refused to return to Japan, and defected to join the Viet Minh in their struggle for independence (First Indochina War) against the returning French colonial forces.

He is best remembered for his stage play Semi-Detached, first performed during 1962, which reached Broadway and was made into the film All the Way Up (1970). He prepared modern versions of classic plays including John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, a version seen in London in 1968, and The Miser by Moli√®re, which was performed at the Birmingham Rep in 1973. An early opponent of the 'Clean-Up TV' founder Mary Whitehouse he interrupted the initial meeting at Birmingham Town Hall in April 1964 as an audience member. At this event, which first brought Mrs Whitehouse to national attention, he accused her of attacking creative freedoms.Dennis Barker Obituary: Mary Whitehouse, The Guardian, 24 November 2001 The creator of Swizzlewick (BBC 1964), a twice weekly comedy drama, he wrote an episode of the series featuring possibly the earliest parody of the morality campaigner.

Mahima Dharma is a distinct religion in the tradition of Indian religions, although the principles of the sect may seem similar to those of Panchashakha, Buddhism, Tantra and Jainism. They recognize how enormously sacred for them the Bhagavata Purana is. They respect all Gods. The sect belongs to a group of ascetics.

He is currently the coach of the Sophie Jackson women's team.https://www.curlingworldcup.com/events/third-leg-jonkoping-sweden?p=teams Career Brewster is a former World Junior champion, having won the title in 1995. The Scottish team which consisted of Paul Westwood, Ronald Brewster, Steve Still and David Murdoch finished 8‚Äì1 after the round robin, and defeated Sweden's Henrik Edlund and then Germany's Daniel Herberg to win the championship. Brewster (far left) at the 2009 Scottish Mixed Curling Championship. Brewster has skipped Scotland to two European Mixed titles, in 2006 and in 2009. Brewster has been a frequent participant in World Curling Tour events, perhaps more so than the more successful Scottish teams. He has won a total of six WCT events, all European events. He has played in 12 Grand Slam events, advancing to the quarterfinals on five occasions (but never further). In 2002, Brewster was invited to play in his first World championship. He was an alternate for the Warwick Smith team which won a bronze medal in 2002. Brewster won his first Scottish men's title in 2011, and represented Scotland at the 2011 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, finishing second in the round robin and winning the silver in the final against Canada's Jeff Stoughton. In 2012 he again won silver, this time losing in the final against Canadian skip Glenn Howard. =2014 Olympic team= Former World Champion David Murdoch was added to the Brewster rink in 2012 to boost the team's chances at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The team did not find immediate success in their first major tournament, finishing 7th at the 2012 European Curling Championships. After then, Brewster was bumped to third on the team, with Murdoch skipping. This turned out to be a successful lineup change, as the team won a bronze medal at the 2013 Ford World Men's Curling Championship. The team then went on to take bronze at the 2013 European Championships. Brewster made his Team GB Winter Olympic debut at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Brewster would not see any action at the games, as he would be the team's alternate for the event. However, he and teammates David Murdoch, Michael Goodfellow, Scott Andrews and Greg Drummond wound up winning the silver medal, after losing to Canada's Brad Jacobs rink in the gold medal game. The team disbanded in 2014. Following the 2014 Olympics, Brewster focused on fitness training, in order to overcome limitations due to a broken leg he suffered when he was younger. In a 2016 interview with The Times he said that this training had allowed him to significantly improve his technique. Subsequently he formed part of a new rink with Hammy McMillan Jr., Ross Patterson, and Glen Muirhead. In 2016 Brewster guided his rink to victories over Team Murdoch in both the Scottish championships in February and the European Playdowns in October. Team Brewster also competed for Scotland at the 2016 World Men's Curling Championship, although they missed out on a medal: subsequently the team were passed over for selection for the 2018 Winter Olympics in favour of Kyle Smith's rink. Personal life Tom is now the Ice rink manager at Curl Aberdeen. He is married to Kim Brewster, and has one son and one daughter.

Nijalingappa, where he was found giving election speeches as part of the campaign for his father's friend, who was contesting on an INC ticket. Nijalingappa entrusted him to another former Chief Minister Veerendra Patil two years later following the split of INC. It was with Patil that Ibrahim later \\"stayed till [the former's] death.\\" Upon finishing schooling, Ibrahim stayed with the INC, later shifting to the Janata Parivar alliance, winning his seat at the 1978 legislative assembly election contesting from the latter's Janata Party ticket. He shifted allegiance to INC two years after, only to quit and join the All India Progressive Janata Dal, and then the Janata Dal (Secular). He held portfolios of Civil Aviation and Tourism and Information and Broadcasting in the Deve Gowda and Gujral government, formed respectively in 1996 and 1997 at the centre. After falling out with JD(S)' leadership, he re-joined the INC in 2008.

Ibrahim claimed that his reasons were ideological, as he was opposed to foreign investment in the Indian aviation sector. However, at the time, a senior bureaucrat accused the Aviation ministry of being \\"a malign influence\\", and there were allegations that Ibrahim was protecting the private carrier Jet Airways.

Although Tata did not name Ibrahim as the offending minister, sections of the media speculated that the minister Tata was referring to may have been Ibrahim. Ibrahim denied the allegation. = Star DTH Controversy = As Information & Broadcasting Minister, Ibrahim denied Star Television permission to operate a Direct to Home (DTH) service in India. It was alleged that Ibrahim had overruled other ministers and was protecting the interests of Star's rival Zee Television, who he granted permission to operate a DTH network. = Voting bribery Controversy = On 1 September 2010, while campaigning in his home state, Ibrahim alleged that Katta Subramanya Naidu, a politician from the rival Bharatiya Janata Party was bribing voters.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 17, 2010. In the episode, Stan's life is reduced to shambles both at home and in school due to Randy's new obsession with the Food Network, while Sharon explores a new interest of her own. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. In its original American broadcast on November 17, 2010, \\"Cr√®me Fra√Æche\\" was watched by 2.87 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It was the highest viewed scripted show of the day. It received a 1.9 rating/5% share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49. Plot Randy has taken an erotic interest in cooking thanks to TV programs on the Food Network. Spending whole nights watching these shows inspires him to replicate the recipes and serve them to his family but leave the task of cleaning to them. Sharon becomes fed up with Randy's behavior, and assumes his fetish for cooking must be because she has become unattractive to him. Encouraged by Sheila Broflovski and TV commercials for the Shake Weight exercise equipment, she eventually buys one with a digital voice which constantly advises, flatters, and instructs her during exercises. In line with the general parody of this device seen in United States popular culture since its d√©but, exercise with the Shake Weight blatantly resembles a handjob ‚Äî complete with \\"release\\" of a \\"cooling fluid\\" on the exerciser's face when \\"done\\". Sharon's Shake Weight also dispenses \\"cab fare\\" into her palm and goes to \\"sleep mode\\" (resembling a flaccid penis) at workout's conclusion. At one point it coaxes Sharon into sticking her finger into a backside receptacle, ostensibly to take her pulse, as described on TV. At South Park Elementary, Randy is discovered to have taken over as cafeteria chef (embracing his predecessor's mannerisms), having quit his job to do so. Ignoring the planned school lunch menus, Randy cooks a variety of extremely gourmet food dishes clearly both too complex for, and not to the liking of, the students. Randy then forces Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny to film him as if he were on his own cooking show. Cartman attempts to impersonate chef Gordon Ramsay to try and discourage Randy's passion for cooking, but the plan falls apart when various celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Bobby Flay arrive in the cafeteria to start a new competitive cooking show, entitled Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge. Sharon is increasingly drawn to her Shake Weight and takes a vacation to a beach resort to exercise with it in private. A short time later however, the Shake Weight's incessant demands to workout, including in public, begin to annoy her. Later the cleaning lady in Sharon's hotel room is caught exercising with the Shake Weight, and it complains that Sharon no longer wants to work out with it. Sharon is angry and calls the Shake Weight company headquarters to return it. Back at the cafeteria, where students have waited 12 hours for a meal after the kitchen was taken over by the chefs, Randy eventually leaves for home when he cannot find his key ingredient, cr√®me fra√Æche. Sharon coincidentally returns home determined to resolve whatever is wrong with their marriage thanks to Randy's obsession with cooking. When Randy mentions he has not slept for several days and that he was \\"in work mode\\", Sharon offers a solution, using her experience handling the Shake Weight to give Randy a \\"nice old fashioned\\". Afterwards, Randy becomes tired and falls asleep in bed, having lost all interest in cooking, and promises to get his job back the next day. Later that night, Sharon thanks the Shake Weight, having figured out its true purpose as a marriage saver. Saying that its work is done, the Shake Weight bids farewell and shuts itself off. Cultural references The episode lampoons the recent rise in popularity of cooking shows on the Food Network. The first cooking show Randy watches (and pleasures himself to) is Guy's Big Bite, starring Guy Fieri. Cartman impersonates Gordon Ramsay, which prompts other TV chefs to appear as well - Jamie Oliver, Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, Masaharu Morimoto, Alton Brown, Giada De Laurentiis, and Paula Deen. The virally popular \\"Shake Weight\\" commercial is largely referenced. Jamie Oliver's outcry is a reference to both the Channel 4 series broadcast \\"Jamie's School Dinners\\" and the American Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution. The theme song to Randy's cooking show is a parody of the \\"Trololo\\" song performed by Eduard Khil. The scene where Sharon \\"elopes\\" with the Shake Weight sitting on beach chairs bears a striking resemblance to a series of Corona commercials (to the point where two bottles of Corona can be seen onscreen in the background). Terrance and Phillip return in a parody of insurance commercials, referencing Progressive and GEICO. Reception In its original American broadcast on November 17, 2010, \\"Cr√®me Fra√Æche\\" was watched by 2.487 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. The episode received a 1.6 rating/3 share, meaning it was seen by 1.6 percent of the population, and 3% of people watching television at the time of the broadcast. Among male viewers between ages 18 and 34, the episode received a 2.7 rating/9 share. Among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, \\"Cr√®me Fra√Æche\\" received a 1.4 rating/4 share, falling two tenths in the ratings, however it was one of the only cable television shows that night to receive a rating higher than 1.0 among adults between 18 and 49 years of age (the other shows being Psych, Meet the Browns and The Ultimate Fighter). IGN rated this episode 8.0 (Impressive), saying \\"This episode didn't waste any time with the jokes, as it opens with a dig at Carnival Cruise Lines and how smelling like poop would actually be an improvement for their ship. That joke is quickly followed by Randy Marsh ignoring his wife's requests to avoid the 'no-no' channel, and we soon find that Randy has a case of Sitophilia (a food fetish) that is only satisfied by the sweet, sweet food love on Food Network.\\" Home release \\"Cr√®me Fra√Æche\\", along with the 13 other episodes from South Park 14th season, was released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.

If you want a carousel horse, don't take it off a carousel; carve your own.\\"Cox, Theresa. \\"History of A Carousel for Missoula.\\" The Brass Ring. I.V (2010): Print. So Kaparich did. By August 1991, Kaparich had carved four ponies. He approached the Missoula City Council with a deal: he would provide the mechanical works, frame, horses and chariots if the city would give the carousel a permanent home. The council agreed, and a board from the Missoula Redevelopment Agency was formed to oversee the project. Three years later, on February 12, 1993, Fried, after seeing pictures of the completed carousel ponies and plans for A Carousel for Missoula, wrote a letter to Kaparich and head carver John Thompson. Fried commented on the professionalism of the carving and called Missoula \\"a shining example to the rest of the United States, inspiring other townships to create their own home- and-hand-made carousels.\\"Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.X (1993): Print.  History  In 1918 the Alan Herschell-Spillman Company of North Tonawanda, New York, created a 38-animal carousel adorned with dogs, frogs, zebras, and roosters as well as horses.Kaparich, Chuck. The Brass Ring. I.XIII (1993): Print. In 1959, Bob Anderson of California erected the Herschell-Spillman carousel at Incline Village amusement park near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, better known as Ponderosa Ranch where the 1960s television western Bonanza was filmed. By 1959 the carousel had undergone significant wear, and many of the original animals were switched for less elaborate ones. The carousel continued to operate in Nevada until 1983, when it was dismantled and the animals were sold at auction. The frame was sold to a secondhand dealer, then to a museum curator in Polson, Montana. The Montana man purchased the frame because it came as part of a package deal with a small children's train. In 1991 the frame was sold to Chuck Kaparich of Missoula for $3,000. The frame, weighing approximately 10-1/2 tons when fully loaded with ponies and chariots, has over 16,000 parts. Before being assembled in its current Missoula location, the volunteer mechanical crew of A Carousel for Missoula replaced the frame's bolts, and cleaned and repainted the other pieces. Originally, the carousel operated on a steam-powered, leather belt-driven motor. A Carousel for Missoula replaced it with a 10-horsepower motor with a fluid clutch.  Funding and building  Funds to pay for A Carousel for Missoula's carving materials came from auctions and pony \\"adoptions\\". Families, businesses, and individuals could pay $2,500 to name, design and adopt a carousel pony. Four horses were adopted by Missoula school children who collected 1 million pennies, or $10,000, for the cause. The Missoula Building Industry Association adopted a chariot and designed it to be accessible for wheelchair users.Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.IX (1993): Print. In July 1992, all 38 horses and both chariots on A Carousel for Missoula were adopted by donors in the Missoula area, ultimately raising $100,000 in cash and pledges.Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.VI (1992): Print. In March 1992 the carousel was designated for a site in the west end of Missoula's Caras Park. The Missoula Redevelopment Agency Board voted to sponsor a design competition among interested architects to develop designs for the carousel building. J. Kirby and Associates of Missoula won the competition with their \\"jewel box\\" design.Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.VIII (1993): Print. In 1994, over $200,000 for building construction were raised through auctions, private donations and band organ song \\"adoptions\\". An additional $58,000 came from donations of materials and labor. A Carousel for Missoula was officially completed on May 27, 1995. About five years later, volunteers reunited to build an addition to A Carousel for Missoula; an outdoor park named Dragon Hollow. Many Missoula individuals and businesses donated time, materials and money to complete the park. In December 2000, Rosemary Gallagher donated $25,000 to Dragon Hollow. The Dennis & Phyllis Washington Foundation also pledged $15,000. Home Depot of Missoula sponsored the park's birthday pavilion, and every Missoula Home Depot employee volunteered to help with construction.\\"Dragon Hollow.\\" Brass Ring. VIII.I (2000): Print. In spring of 2001, over 4,000 volunteers built Dragon Hollow in nine days.\\"Magic Is Made By Volunteers.\\" A Carousel for Missoula. N.p., 27 Nov. 2010. Web. 27 Nov 2010. . Since its opening, the carousel has given about 225,000 rides per year.The Brass Ring. VII.II(2000): Print.  Carving and creation  Kaparich teamed with design coordinator Cherry Gillespie and head carver John Thompson to design, create and oversee the completion of the ponies, chariots, band organ and artistic elements of A Carousel for Missoula.Badenoch, Geoff. The Brass Ring. I.VI (1992): Print. A staff composed entirely of volunteers completed the carving, sanding and painting of the 38 ponies and two chariots, as well as the other decorative pieces. Carving classes taught over 50 volunteers how to create gargoyles, mirror frames, and the horses' legs, bodies, manes, and heads. A restoration and mechanical crew revitalized the parts and pieces of the carousel frame Kaparich had purchased. The ponies, weighing when completed, were carved from basswood, the soft yet durable wood of linden trees. The ponies were not carved in one solid piece, but seven separate pieces: head, neck, body and four legs. Volunteers and the ponies' \\"adoptive\\" families tucked memorabilia inside the ponies' hollow bodies before they were assembled and painted. Traditional carousel ponies come in three styles. Coney Island ponies are baroque and bejeweled, Philadelphia ponies more realistic and Country renditions more primitive. Bette Largent, who painted and restored ponies for Spokane's Looff carousel before training the volunteer painters in Missoula, said A Carousel for Missoula created a unique, distinctive style tagged as the \\"Garden City steeds\\". In the book A Carousel for Missoula Largent said, \\"The Missoula ponies are accurate, but always with a good measure of whimsy and humor. They are sturdy, yet remarkable in detail.\\" Kaparich said he believes \\"the diversity of Missoula's horses came from the decision to adopt them out to donors, who then had rights to the design.\\" Approximately 800 hours of work went into the completion of each pony. Finally, the canopy of the carousel was adorned with 966 light bulbs, 14 carved gargoyles in frames, and 14 carved frames holding etched mirrors. A hand-carved wooden dragon, named Lucky Red Ringer, was made as a unique way for riders to play the historical brass ring game. Plastic rings are loaded into a tube that fits inside the length of the dragon's body and exits the dragon's mouth. Lucky Red Ringer perches in a wooden hand-carved tree, close enough to the outside row of carousel horses for riders to grab the plastic rings from the dragon's mouth while the carousel is in motion. One brass ring is added to the ring tube, and the rider who grabs the brass ring wins a free ride. Lucky Red Ringer, upon close examination, has a wedding ring carved onto his finger. Head carver Thompson added the wedding ring to the dragon's finger after his wife claimed Thompson spent more time with Lucky Red Ringer than her.\\"A Carousel for Missoula.\\" The National Carousel Association. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Nov 2010. http://www.nca-usa.org/psp/Missoula/  The band organ  Scott Olson, a volunteer for A Carousel for Missoula, was committed to finding a band organ to complete the mood of the carousel. In April 1992, Don Stinson's band organ company in Bellefontaine, Ohio, began to construct an organ to Missoula's specifications. Olson traveled to Ohio three times that year to oversee construction of the organ. 1-1/2 years and $65,000 later, the organ arrived in Missoula. The organ contains over 400 hand-made wooden pipes and has the sound capacity of 23 instruments. It works like a player piano, using paper song rolls. Holes in the paper rolls signal specific pipes to create music. Each roll has ten songs and plays for about 40 minutes.Olson, Scott. The Brass Ring. I.VII (1992): Print. Several music rolls were created just for the carousel, featuring music \\"adopted\\" by local donors, such as the fight song of the University of Montana. The organ was enclosed by an 8-foot- high, 17-foot-wide, wooden facade depicting a medieval scene with cliffs, castles, knights and dragons, all hand-carved by Glenn Watters of Missoula in less than two years. The band organ at A Carousel for Missoula is the largest carousel band organ in continuous use in America.  Visitor information  During non-public hours the carousel can be rented for private events and celebrations for 100 sit-down, or 200 standing room guests. Birthday parties or other festivities can also be scheduled during public hours. A Carousel for Missoula is open daily, with hours subject to change seasonally: *11 a.m. - 5:30 p.m; Sept. through May *11 a.m. - 7 p.m.; June through Aug.\\"Magic Is Made By Volunteers.\\" A Carousel for Missoula.

Origin and history Ghumura Dance during Odisha Tribal sports meet. =Mythology= Beside historical evidence, the origin of Ghumura dance has taken into consideration of public views and myths. Based on myth, poet Shivam Bhasin Panda wrote Ghumura Janma Bidhan in 1954. Nandini Bhasin and Gaganeswar have also described a myth regarding origin of Ghumura, in which they described that Chandra Dhwaja has originally established the dance and later it was taken over a demon ‚Äî Karttabirya Asura. As per Chandi Purana Durga, the eternal deity of Shakti, asked all the Gods and Goddesses of heaven to lend their weapons, as instruments and conveyances to kill a demon king Mahisasur. One of the war-musical instruments collected was the Ghumura instrument that was formed by combination of a portion of Dambaru, a musical instrument of Lord Siva, and Veena of goddess Saraswati. As per Mahabharata, Ghumura was used by Gods and Goddesses as a musical instrument during war. According to Sarala Mahabharata, during Satya Juga-Jenabali-Patana was the capital of the king Gogingh Daitya, grandson of Mahisasura. Many people accept that Mahisasura Jenabali-Patana of that age is the Junagarh of today. However, in the Madhya Parba of Mahabharat, Ghumura has been mentioned with description about killing of Gosingh Daitya. Sarala Dasa has also described it as the Rana-Badya (war music) of Mahisasura.Sarala Das, Chandi Purana, pp. 45 & 96 A few experts believed Ghumura was a war music (Rana-Badya) of Ravana, demon king of Lanka, and Lanka-garh. Goddess Lankeswari, the favorite goddess of Ravana, is worshiped in the region. According to them after Lanka was destroyed by Hanuman and after Ravana was killed, Goddess Lankeswari left Lanka and came to settle in Jenabali-Patana (now it is Junagarh, Kalahandi) where she is worshiped. There are myths about the origin of Nishan and Tala. After building Chandrachuda Bindhani out of iron found from Bindhya Giri and covering its top with a skin of dead Bouta cow, it was inaugurated with Panchakshar-Mantra. Its parents Gaurab Gandharb and Urbasi called it Nishan. Likewise the Tala was created by a Saint-Kasyapa Risi. Nishan and Tala are considered as symbols of Radha-Krishna. =Archaeological aspects= Archaeological evidence provesThe Heroic Dance Ghumura, edited by Sanjay Kumar, Mahabir Sanskrutika, 2002 that there are some cave painting from pre- historic period discovered from Gudahandi of Kalahandi and Yogi Matha of Nuapada district that looks like Ghumura, Damru and other attractive things. These rock art sites belongs to more than 8000 B.C. and from such painting the antiquity of musical instrument Ghumura and Damru can be imagined. It is also proved that during mythological age, Kalahandi had prosperous and developed civilization. The origin of Ghumura goes back to ancient times. There is a beautiful waterfall in the river valley of Indravati, which was initially recognized by Chindak Nagas of Chakrakot.Epigraphica Indica, IX, p. 179 Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century A.D. On the other hand, analysts opine that 'Banka-Paika' of Kalampur had carried Lankeswari deity with a grand procession of Ghumura music to Junagarh in 1008 A.D. when the Naga dynasty shifted their old capital from Jugasaipatna to Junagarh.Girijhara, 1982, p. 8 The terracotta and stone objects found from medieval site in Nehena, 3 km from Khariar, resembles Ghumura object dated to the 9th and 10th centuries. In the 12th century A.D. Ghumura dance was already popular, which is evident from a scene of one person playing the instrument Ghumura in a stone-hole of Nritya Mandir of Konark Sun Temple. Bhimeswar temple in Bhubaneswar shows another scene of Ghumura dance reconfirming that origin of Ghumura dance was in the 10th century A.D. Dr Mahendra Kumar Mishra, a noted folklorist and ethnomusicologist of Kalahandi, has researched extensively on ethnography of Ghumra dance of kalahandi, which can be accessed in the website www.scribd.com. Dr Mishra has widely discussed on structure, function and socio-cultural context of Ghumra dance of Kalahandi adjoining Bastar and Chhatishgarh and part of Orissa in his well-researched book Kalahandira Lokasanskruti (1996) published by Freidns Publishers, Cuttack. Transformation of war music into folk music and dance In mythological ages Ghumura was a favorite music instrument of Gods and Demons during war, which was followed in subsequent time as the heroic war music by successive kings and soldiers of Orissa, especially in Kalahandi. Many kings in the region such as Eastern Ganga dynasty had well-organized soldiers with Ghumura as their primary war music.K. Mishra, Utkal Itihas During that period, the Ghumura song hadn't been composed nor sung. Only its music and dance were being used during wartime to make the soldiers excited with the spirit of fighting. Later on the song was integrated with the music and dance of Ghumura, since it was regarded as the only medium of exercise for body building and entertainment during leisure time of Paikas or soldiers. During British rule, the Paikas were often inactive and used to get sufficient leisure time, for which the Ghumura was developed by them as a primary means of entertainment. Afterwards poets and writers in general of Orissa and in particular of Kalahandi took initiatives to compose songs of Ghumura while writing about Devi bandana (hymns or prayer to deities), glory of dynasties and mythological studies. In this way Chanda- Chaupadis of poet Upendra Bhanja, Dinakrushna, Abhimanyu Samanta Singar, etc. gradually entered into Ghumura, which made it much more enchanting. As a result, common people living in the rural areas of Kalahandi became very attracted by this music, song and dance of Ghumura and formed many Ghumura groups to develop and spread. In this respect, the royal families of Bhawanipatna, Jayapatna, Madanpur Rampur, Khariar etc. also highly encouraged and helped these groups of village folk. During religious and cultural festivals like 'Dasahara' many of these groups used to gather together on the altars of deities, e.g., Manikeswari of Bhawanipatna, Lankeswari of Jungarh, Raktambari of Khariar, Dakeshwari of Madanpur Rampur, Budha Raja of Ampani etc. However, for the distinctive recognition of the Ghumura group reform and development was made in the manner and nature of dress, painting, dance, music and song. While performing, the Ghumura dancers and singers of each group used to ask very complicated question related to socio-economic and political problems to their competent opposite group through the medium of the songs. This gave birth to the contemporary form of Ghumura-Ladhei or Badi-Ghumura in Kalahandi, which is very meaningful, attractive and enchanting.M. Sahu, Kalahandi Kala and Sanskruti, 1992m pp. 112‚Äì113 Etymological meaning Ghumura is an earthen pitcher and the imagination of the preparation of such pitcher into a musical instrument is a polygenetic development. 'Ghumura' is derived from 'Ghum+u+Ra'. 'Ghum' means bowl like pitcher made of soil or clay and having a thin face with big belly. 'U' means 'Lord Siva' and 'Ra' mean 'Raba' or 'Dhowni' (vibrating sound). Earthen clay pot is locally known as 'Ghumuri', which was largely used by females to reserve water for home use. The male version of 'Ghumuri' is 'Ghumura'. Since Ghumura is a male dance form and it is found in almost all parts of the human culture that equipment and appliances invented for human use have been the foundation to the invention of musical instruments, the derivation of name of Ghumura from 'Ghumuri' signifies such claim.

It is in unknown if in its early period whether it was a caste-based dance or not. By the time when Ghumura entered into the sphere of folk dance, above from the level of tribal dance, it was extensively performed by almost all castes and communities. Perhaps, Ghumura was a caste-based dance of a particular caste in its beginning and later on extended to different castes and communities. It was then widely accepted as a mass dance from folk dance. Development and spread Ghumura dance has had the opportunity to represent the nation in international events in Delhi, Moscow, and other places.

It pitted local Indonesian Republicans on the island of Sulawesi against the Dutch who sought to re- assert their authority. The Dutch counter-insurgency offensive was masterminded by the controversial Raymond Westerling, a Captain in the KNIL (Royal Netherlands East Indies Army). Westerling's operation, which started in December 1946 and ended in February 1947, succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans by instituting summary executions of suspected enemy fighters. Background of the insurgency Between 1816 and 1905, the Dutch consolidated their control over the Bugis states of South Sulawesi. By 1911, the Dutch had integrated the entire region into the Dutch East Indies.Tol (2001), p. 136 Dutch rule was interrupted by the Japanese invasion of the East Indies during World War Two. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Sulawesi along with much of eastern Indonesia was administrated by the Imperial Japanese Navy which sought to suppress local Republican and nationalist movements in contrast to the Army-dominated occupations of Java and Sumatra.Kahin (1952), p. 355 Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the nationalist movement in Sulawesi established contact with Sukarno's Republican administration in Java. However, due to the weak state of the nationalist forces in Sulawesi, they were unable to resist Australian and Dutch occupation forces which quickly occupied much of East Indonesia with little resistance. By 5 April 1946, most of the local Republican administration including Governor Sam Ratulangi were imprisoned by the returning Dutch authorities. The Dutch also interned the pro-Republican aristocracy and their supporters. Despite this, resistance continued in the form of pro-Republican intellectuals and guerrillas, surviving nobility and Java-based militants. The Dutch downplayed the local resistance as manifestations of international Communism and Javanese domination,Westerling (1952), p. 92 portraying the native populations as contented and resistant to revolutionary change.Westerling (1952), p. 89 When the Allies officially handed over the administration of Celebes back to the Netherlands on July 13, 1946, the Dutch were also facing persistent violence. Hundreds of freedom fighters from Java made the crossing to assist 'their brothers on Celebes', carrying enormous amounts of smuggled weapons. What made things even more confusing was the fact that the resistance of the Indonesians became fragmented into all kinds of - competing - parties, which in turn sometimes entered into alliances with criminal gangs (Rampokkers). In Makassar, Goa, Takalar and Djeneponto, the\\" Tentara Lipan Badjeng \\"(The Badjeng Centipedes Army) was working had killed 309 enemies in a few months. Among all these enemies indicated by name, all Indonesian civilians, were also children. Besides this gang, the \\"Semoet Merah\\" (the Red Ant), who specialized in arson, operated in Makassar, but was also guilty of murder and kidnapping. In September 1946, the Gelarang of Pantjambeang was murdered on the way to Malino (shot and stabbed to death) with his entire family (18 people). In kampong Kandjilo a well was discovered with 80 heads. In Tolo, according to the Djannang of Parigi, about 20 people were slaughtered as buffalos and their corpses were thrown into the river. The method of killing by these Indonesian 'nationalistic' groups was to lay (or hold) the victim on the ground and cut his neck with a badik (dagger knife). In total, at least 1,210 people would have been murdered between June 1946 and July 1947 by these Indonesian fighter groups.https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/archief/2.09.95/inventaris?inventarisnr=150 https://indonesischearchipel.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/makassar/ https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/NL- HaNA/type/fa/id/2.09.95/unitid/2.09.95+-+150 Despite the Malino Conference in July 1946 which established local federal states in Dutch-controlled parts of Indonesia, the Sulawesi government's effectiveness was weakened by the poor economic situation, agricultural famines and a non-existent civil administration.Westerling (1952), p. 90 The Indonesian Republic in Java provided training for Sulawesi guerrillas and even dispatched Javanese forces, using the ports of Polongbangkeng and Barru for landing troops and supplies. By December 1946, Dutch authority in the island was limited to the confines of Makassar and on the verge of an absolute breakdown. Hundreds of government officials and members of the pro-Dutch Eurasian and Indo Chinese community, were attacked and killed. The KNIL garrisons, stationed on the island, were not able to provide protection.Westerling (1952), p. 93 The \\"Westerling Method\\" The failure of conventional tactics prompted the Netherlands East Indies government to dispatch the maverick counter-insurgency expert Raymond Westerling who initiated a three-month pacification campaign from December 1946 to February 1947. Earlier Dutch tactics had focused on temporarily detaining and releasing suspected guerrillas.Westerling (1952), p. 95 In November 1946, British-trained commando Westerling had developed a contingent of commandos within the KNIL known as the Depot Special Forces (DST), which specialised in counter-insurgency warfare and interrogation. According to Westerling, pacifying Sulawesi, without losing thousands of innocent lives could only be accomplished by instituting summary justice on the spot of suspected enemy fighters, who were generally executed. This became known as the \\"Westerling Method\\". Westerling ordered the registration of all Javanese arriving in Makassar due to the large numbers of Javanese participating in the Sulawesi resistance. He also used scouts to infiltrate local villages and to identify members of the resistance.Westerling (1952), p. 96 Based on their information and that of the Dutch military intelligence service, the DST surrounded one of more suspected villages during night, after which they drove the population to a central location. At daybreak, the operation began, often led by Westerling. Men would be separated from women and children. From the gathered information Westerling exposed certain people as terrorists and murderers. They were shot without any further investigation. Afterwards Westerling forced local communities to refrain from supporting guerillas by swearing on the Quran and established local self-defence units with some members recruited from former guerrillas deemed as \\"redeemable\\".Westerling (1952), pp. 101‚Äì105 Westerling directed eleven operations throughout the campaign. He succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans. His actions restored Dutch rule in southern Sulawesi. However, the Netherlands East Indies government and the Dutch army command soon realised that Westerling's notoriety led to growing public criticism. In April 1947 the Dutch government instituted an official inquiry of his controversial methods. Raymond Westerling was put on the sidelines. He was relieved of his duties in November 1948.Westerling (1952), pp. 98‚Äì99 Controversy over death toll and myth formation The Republican government claimed that Westerling was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. Initially they had estimated the number of victims at 15,000, but later stated it was 40,000. A monument with the name Monumen Korban 40.000 Jiwa was erected in the city of Makassar to commemorate the victims of the campaign. Dutch historian Jaap de Moor blames the inflation of the death toll on the fact that Republican government used it as propaganda to draw attention from the world to their diplomatic and armed struggle against the Dutch. Mohammed Natzir of the Indonesian Historical Commission of the Armed Forces also calls the figure of 40,000 deaths fiction and a propaganda measure of the Republican government against the Dutch occupation of that time. In his book De Zuid-Celebes Affaire: Kapitein Westerling en de standrechtelijke executies Dutch historian Willem IJzereef estimates that the actions of the DST cost about 1,500 Indonesian lives. About 400 of them were executed during actions led by Westerling himself, while the remaining 1,100 were killed during actions of his second in command. Another 1,500 deaths could be added by actions of other KNIL units. Approximately 900 Indonesians were killed by pro-Dutch police units and members of the village guards. IJzereef believes that Indonesian resistance caused around 1,500 victims.IJzereef (1984), p. 172 Research by former military officer Bauke Geersing written down in Kapitein Raymond Westerling en de Zuid-Celebes-affaire (1946-1947), Mythe en werkelijkheid (Captain Raymond Westerling and the South Celebes Affair (1946-1947), Myth and Reality ) led to his believe that with regard to this period in South Celebes, there is a myth surrounding the behavior of Westerling and distortion of history. Geersing used a research model based on 'contextual' historiography. kapitein Raymond Westerling en de Zuid-Celebes-affaire (1946-1947 Mythe en werkelijkheid Paperback 9789463387651 Druk: 1 november 2019 508 Accusations of war crimes Westerling has always defended his actions and denied accusations of war crimes. His memoirs, which he publiced in 1952, devote a chapter to his self-defense. \\"They painted me as a bloodthirsty monster, who attacked the people of Celebes by fire and sword and exposed all those, who in the interest of Indonesia's national independence resisted Dutch rule, to a merciless campaign of repression\\". Westerling stated he had based his tactics on the premise that he performed the role of policeman, combating terror: \\"I arrested terrorists, not because they acted as instigators of the Republican government... but because they made themselves guilty of open and unmistaken crimes...I never had them [his troops] bombard a village, nor did I take the hut of innocent under fire. I had executed some criminals, but nobody had died needlessly or wrongly by my doing.Westerling (1952), p. 150 In 1949, the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian agreement on transfer of power stipulated neither country would call the other on its wartime offences, thus ruling out any attempt by Indonesia to press for Westerling's extradition. Lawsuit against Dutch State In 2013, the Dutch ambassador in Indonesia, apologized on behalf of the Dutch government. In 2014 widows and children of the murdered men filed a lawsuit against the Dutch state. A Dutch court ruled in 2015 that the Dutch state was liable for the damage done because it was Dutch territory and the people residents of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On March 2020, Hague District Court ordered the Dutch government to pay damage compensation ranging from to to relatives of 11 men executed in South Sulawesi campaign.

He was killed test flying the Hawker P.1081 prototype fighter. Early life Wade was born on 27 January 1920 in Wandsworth, London. He was educated at Yardley Court and Tonbridge School. In April 1938, aged 18, he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as an Airman u/t (under training) and learned to fly at No. 19 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School, Gatwick. He was called to full-time service at the outbreak of war and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer (on probation) on 30 April 1940. Fighter pilot A month later Wade was posted to No. 92 Squadron, part of No. 10 Group RAF and then based at Croydon Airport. On his first day (26 May) he borrowed Tony Bartley's Spitfire to get more flying hours on type, performing a low level roll immediately after takeoff. His nickname \\"Wimpy\\" was borrowed from the American cartoon character of Popeye fame. In June the squadron was moved to RAF Pembrey. On 28 July Wade was flying a night patrol over Swansea Bay. As his fuel ran low, with deteriorating visibility and a failed radio he elected to bail out over Exeter. On 19 August he was in action for the first time. He shared the destruction of a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire. As a result, he had to make a forced landing, managing to escape before his aircraft ignited. Wade was engaged in more combat in September, claiming a half share in a Do 17 on 10 September, a He 111 on 11 September, a probable Bf 109E on 15 September, damage to Bf 109Es on 18 September and 20 September, with the destruction of a Do 17 on 22 September. . On 27 September he was hit by return fire and had to force land at Lewes, his aircraft flipping over. Wade's luck held out during the final phase of the Battle of Britain. On 12 October he claimed one Bf 109E destroyed, one probable and one damaged. On 26 October he claimed one Bf 109 probable, on 29 October a Bf110 probable and on 26 November a Do 17 probable. On 2 December Wade was engaged in combat, he claimed one Bf 109E but yet again was hit by return fire forcing him to land at Gravesend. In June 1941 his combat tour was over and he was sent to join No. 123 Squadron at RAF Turnhouse, which at that time was assigned operational training duties.. While there, he received notification that he had been awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts during the first part of the war and achieving seven confirmed victories. The citation, published in the London Gazette on 15 July 1941, read: In September 1941 he was posted as a Flight commander to No 602 Squadron for what would be a short tour, because during a raid on the Marquise Shell factory, on 17 September, he received a wound which ended his career as a combat pilot. After he had recovered in October 1941, he was sent to the Central Flying School on an instructors course. Following this, he became a pilot-gunnery instructor; first at the Central Gunnery School; then at 9 Group's headquarters, responsible for gunnery instruction at fighter OTUs.* He was promoted to Squadron Leader (temporary) on 30 October 1942 and in late 1943 he was made the Officer Commanding at the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU). For his service at the AFDU he was awarded the AFC in September 1944 Early in 1945 he was sent to USA to test captured Japanese aircraft and also to gain experience of early jets Test pilot Wade was demobilised in 1946 and joined the staff of The Aeroplane magazine, testing and reporting on new civil light aeroplanes. Within a year (October 1947) he had joined Hawker Aircraft as an assistant to the Chief Test Pilot Bill Humble. He was initially tasked with the production testing of Furies and Sea Furies, but also assisted with the development flying of the N.7/46 (P.1040). When Humble became a sales manager in June 1948, Wade became Chief Test Pilot and focussed on the development flying of the latest Hawker jets. In August 1948 Wade made the first public demonstration of the P.1040, flying it from Langley Airfield (Hawker's flight test centre). Later in that month he competed in the 1948 S.B.A.C. air race at Lympne , flying a Hawker Fury. Hawker's first swept wing jet was the P.1052; Wade made the maiden flight of the first of the two prototypes (VX272) on 19 November 1948. On 13 May 1949,The same day as the first flight of the Canberra prototype he set up a new record for the London-Paris flight, flying 221 miles in 21min 28s, an average speed of 618 mph. In August 1949 he won the S.B.A.C. Challenge Cup race in the P.1040 (competing against John Cunningham in a D.H Vampire F3 and John Derry in the D.H.108). He averaged 510 m.p.h over the course, with one lap at 584 m.p.h. thereby gaining the Geoffrey de Havilland Trophy for the fastest racing time of the year. The rear fuselage of the second P.1052 prototype (VX279) was rebuilt to use a straight-through jet pipe and a swept tailplane. Thus modified it was re-designated as P.1081. On 19 June 1950 Wade flew the P.1081 on its maiden flight from RAE Farnborough. He was satisfied with its behaviour and put in approximately six hours flying over the following three days prior to flying it to the Antwerp international air display, successfully demonstrating it on 25 June. Testing VX279 was not without incident, during one test flight in 1950, a main wheel failed to lower but Wade managed to land the aircraft without serious consequences. Wade surpassed his performance at Antwerp at the S.B.A.C. Display in September 1950, when he demonstrated its high roll rate and speed in level flight. In January 1951 Wade was the first of a group of British test pilots to go to the United States on an exchange scheme. There he gained experience of supersonic flight in the F86 Sabre. The prototype Hawker P.1081 was transferred from Hawkers to RAE Farnborough for high speed research. On 3 April 1951 Wade was testing it when the aircraft entered an unrecoverable flight regime. It has been suggested that he was attempting a transonic dive and had inadvertently gone supersonic.Bill Bedford has suggested that Wade may have tried to go supersonic using a vertical dive as was the technique with the F86 Sabre. However, because the P.1081 lacked powered flying controls (unlike the F86) Wade could not recover Wade elected to eject, jettisoning the canopy at 9000 ft and ejecting at 2000 ft. While the ejection was successful, he failed to separate from the seat and was killed on impact with the ground.the reason for the crash and the seat failure was not determined at the time or subsequently. Wade's death resulted in Percy ('Laddie') Lucas, MP for Brentford and Chiswick, questioning the Minister of Supply on 30 April 1951 about the types of ejector seat fitted to British aircraft, how they were tested and the insurance of British test pilots. While at the time the RAF used Martin Baker ejection seats, the Hawker P.1081 was fitted with an ML seat. Personal life Trevor Wade married Josephine Clow Gibbins on 2 August 1940 at Oxted, with many of his 92 Squadron colleagues attending the service and the reception, which was held at the White Hart in Brasted, Kent. Trevor and Josephine had three children: two sons and a daughter.

He is also well known as a devoted and tireless government official who presided over art programs in Burma. Early life While still an adolescent, San Win was adopted by Martin Ward, a professor of physics at Rangoon University during the British colonial period in Burma. Ward was a hobby painter and the founder of the Burma Art Club (BAC) when it first began operation in 1913. The BAC was initially established to meet the needs of the British community in Rangoon for weekend painting sessions; however, its agenda became more and more ambitious, and young Burmese artists such as Ba Nyan and San Win became members of the club and availed themselves of its training. In 1920, Ba Nyan was sent to London on a colonial stipend where he was taught European styles of oil painting in more academic and professional settings. When Ba Nyan returned to Burma permanently in 1930, he passed on his accomplished painting skills to many other Burmese painters. While San Win was never one of Ba Nyan's official apprentices, it is certain that San Win observed Ba Nyan's techniques closely and learned from him. Career as a teacher and art official San Win graduated from Rangoon University late, in 1931, at the age of 26. Following graduation, he became a high school art teacher, and later, in 1932 or 1933, he became an art lecturer at the Teacher‚Äôs Training College, where by 1934, he had risen to the position of chief of art teachers. In about the same year, he accepted a position as an art official in the Department of Education. In 1939, when the State School of Art and Music opened, he became its first principal. During the World War II years, like many of the major painters of Burma, he remained active, working as an instructor at the Institute of Art, established by the Japanese during their period of war occupation in Burma. Travel and study overseas From 1948-51, San Win studied art education at Goldsmiths, University of London (formerly Goldsmiths College), and later studied at Columbia University from 1952-53 as a Fulbright/Smith-Mundt Scholar. After returning to Burma, he became a deputy minister of art education. He was subsequently awarded a Wunna Kyaw Htin, the highest title that can be bestowed upon an individual in Burma for civil service. In 1960-61, San Win had further opportunities to travel overseas on a UNESCO cultural exchange program, in which he visited and studied art education in England, the USA, Italy, France, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and perhaps other countries. Innovator of Burmese impressionism Despite his heavy responsibilities as a teacher and art official, San Win managed to produce a healthy amount of his work in his life, and he would be regarded by almost any scholar of 20th century Burmese painting as one of the top dozen or so painters of his time. He is particularly known for advancing impressionism in Burma. Thein Han, the writer, not the painter, said of him, \\"In landscapes whose contrasts of light and shade sometimes recall the impressionism of Monet, and in occasional figures, U San Win has shown his mastery of the tonal values of color.\\" San Win introduced a form of impressionism that was unique to Burma, quite unlike European impressionism with it rich flushes of bold, often primary colors. The painting of Burma up to San Win‚Äôs time was filled by much more subdued and restrained displays of color, often dark and quite moody. In San Win‚Äôs work, the dominant colors are often light or shadowy dark blues, browns, greys and twinges of gold, with splotches of red, pink or yellow in the color of the longyi (the national dress) of small background figures, and often many of them, walking in paths towards temples. There are few landscape paintings by him where the spots of red in longyis do not appear and this can be called a signature element in his work. The color yellow also appears more lightly in his skies but it is not overbearing. San Win‚Äôs chief subject in his work was the famous religious monuments and sites of Burma, though he did also do more secular landscapes of ordinary life. He did very few portraits and very few still life. Almost all of his work is in oil. In some of his oil works, he used the impasto technique where the paint rises off the surface of the painting in thick daubs. Watercolor paintings by San Win are rare. He is also known to have made posters with Bogalay Kyaw Hlaing. He did paintings of scenes from his trips abroad‚Äî-quite a few works of the Egyptian pyramids and at least one London scene of the Thames. His legacy San Win, born in 1905, and Ngwe Gaing, born in 1901, can be said to be contemporaries of Ba Nyan, born in 1897, who was the founder of what may be called the Rangoon School. Ba Nyan died early, in his late forties, and the mantle of instruction in the Rangoon School then passed to Ngwe Gaing, San Win, and Thein Han (painter), who was one of Ba Nyan‚Äôs apprentices. A great many painters of the next generation listed San Win and Ngwe Gaing as their teachers on their resumes. Some of the painters that studied under San Win were Hla Baw, Tun Nyunt, Chit Tun, U Kyi, Kan Nyunt, Khin Maung (Yangon), Thu Ka, Nyan Shein (painter and art historian), Thein Nyunt, Lun Gywe, and Tun Sein.

Life Farmer studied at the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in Vancouver and the San Francisco Art Institute.  Art practice  Geoffrey Farmer creates installation-based artworks using combinations of a broad range of elements,Witte de With, Center for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam Retrieved November 16, 2010 including: drawing, photography, video, sculpture, performance, and found materials. Farmer‚Äôs work offers an exceptionally subtle take on the legacies of minimalist and postminimalist art. Minimalism emphasized the artwork's ability to instill in the viewer a powerful sense of their own presence; Farmer's work begins with this idea of the art gallery as a site of phenomenological experience. Postminimalism represents a refinement of minimalism in the way it emphasizes the role the gallery context plays in creating the meaning of an artwork. Farmer adds to both traditions by focusing on the contingent nature of meaning itself, especially emphasizing its fragile and elusive nature. Contingency in Farmer's art extends to the strategies he devises to foster a self-reflexive engagement with his work. Whereas minimalist artists, such as Donald Judd and Dan Flavin, were said by art critic Michael Fried to theatricalize the gallery-going experience, Farmer uses the idioms of theatre and performance as analogies of the process of meaning construction. This places him within the international trend, in which \\"installation art is a theatrical set without a stage play to give it meaning.\\" For instance, Farmer's piece Hunchback Kit (2000-7 at the TateTate online Retrieved November 16, 2010 uses a hard shell case with custom foam insert to house props for the staging performances of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Farmer creates the art exhibition as a set of components made available for the viewer's interpretation. In this process, he casts himself in the role of the 'artist', continuing to add to and transform an exhibition during the time it is on view. In For Every Jetliner Used in an Artwork‚Ä¶ (2006), for instance, Farmer presented a video in the exhibition of himself working to alter an installation during the night while the show is closed. By explicitly portraying the exhibition as being 'in process', Farmer ensures that \\"a degree of openness and instability is built in to his work.\\"Frieze.com Retrieved November 15, 2010 According to Mark Clintberg writing in The Drawing Room, London for Canadian Art International Farmer's work The Last Two Million Years(2007), takes the ephemerality of time as its theme, making small delicate sculptures from the pages of an Encyclopedia.Mark Clintberg, Canadian Art International Retrieved November 16, 2010 Creating hybrid figurative objects out of disparate historical time periods, Farmer undoes the fixity of museological display and the agreed sequence of historical events.

It contains sly references to Rick James and his hit, \\"Super Freak\\". Background By the recording of Midnight Love, Gaye was influenced by the different musical styles that were dominating the pop music scene of the 1980s from synthpop and new wave artists such as Duran Duran to rock artists such as John Lennon, a pop music contemporary he was often compared to, reggae legend Bob Marley and funk/R&B; artists such as Prince, Michael Jackson and Rick James. For this song, the musical style of James, which mixed styles of funk, synthpop and new wave particularly on James' biggest crossover hit, \\"Superfreak\\", influenced the direction of what became \\"Midnight Lady\\". In its alternate demo version, later released on the Midnight Love and the Sexual Healing Sessions album, it's titled as \\"Clique Games/Rick James\\".

Throughout the song, Gaye continues referencing the woman he's after as a \\"superfreak\\". Lyrically wise and musically wise, the influence of \\"Superfreak\\" was prominent. In one verse, Gaye tells the woman, \\"somebody said you was a superfreak/I'm here to tell you I'm a superfreak, baby.\\" Gaye would later admit he was influenced by James for the duration of the album as it progressed.

First formed in 1915 for service during the First World War as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), it fought in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Belgium before being disbanded in late 1918 to provide reinforcements for other heavily depleted Australian units. In 1921, following the demobilisation of the AIF, the battalion was re-raised as a unit of Australia's part-time military forces, based in Melbourne, Victoria, before being amalgamated with the 22nd Battalion in 1930. It was later re-raised in its own right and, following the outbreak of the Second World War, undertook garrison duties in Australia before being amalgamated with the 46th Battalion to form the 29th/46th Battalion in late 1942, subsequently seeing service against the Japanese in New Guinea and on New Britain. History =First World War= The 29th Battalion was originally formed during the First World War, being raised in Victoria as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 10 August 1915.. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Bennett, an officer with over 20 years service in the part-time military forces, the battalion undertook initial training at Seymour and then later Broadmeadows Camp along with the three other battalions of the 8th Brigade, to which it was assigned.. In November 1915, the battalion embarked upon the troopship HMAT Ascanius in Port Melbourne and departed Australian waters, disembarking at Port Suez, Egypt on 7 December 1915.. The battalion arrived in the Middle East too late to take part in the fighting at Gallipoli,. and as a result they were initially used to undertake defensive duties to protect the Suez Canal from Ottoman forces. They also undertook a comprehensive training program and by the time their orders arrived to transfer to Europe in June 1916, they had reached their peak.. They subsequently embarked the troopship HMT Tunisian in Alexandria, bound for France on 14 June.. Upon the battalion's arrival in Egypt, the 8th Brigade had been unattached at divisional level, but in early 1916, it was assigned to the 5th Division, after a reorganisation that saw the AIF expanded from two infantry divisions to five... The battalion arrived at Marseilles on 23 June and afterwards was transported by rail to Hazebrouck.. On 8 July the 5th Division was called up to the front from training behind lines in order to replace the battalions of the Australian 4th Division which were being transferred to the Somme. The 29th Battalion undertook a difficult two-day approach march over cobbled roads with loads of up to before arriving at the front on the night of 10/11 July... Taking up a position between Boutillerie and Condonerrie in the Bois Grenier, they relieved the 13th Battalion and on 19 July subsequently took part in an attack against the German positions around the \\"Delangre Farm\\" which was being held by the 21st Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment.. Following the attack, the battalion held the line for another 11 days, beating off a particularly heavy German counterattack on 20 July, before they were eventually relieved. During their introduction to trench warfare, the 29th Battalion lost 52 men killed in action, and another 164 men wounded.. A platoon commander from the 29th Battalion addresses his troops, 8 August 1918 For the next two and half years they fought in a number of major battles in the trenches along the Western Front including Polygon Wood, Amiens and the St Quentin Canal, as well as playing a supporting role in a number of others including Bullecourt and Morlancourt. During the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that was launched on 8 August 1918, the battalion took part in the 8th Brigade's advance up the treacherous Morcourt Valley, subsequently achieving a considerable feat by capturing the town of Vauvillers.. The battalion fought its last battle of the war in late September alongside the US 30th Infantry Division, when they breached the German defences along the Hindenburg Line as part of the final Allied offensive of the war. Aimed at the Le Catelet Line near Bellicourt, the battalion began its advance on Nauroy on 29 September, moving on the left flank beside elements of the US 117th Infantry Regiment, with the 32nd Battalion in support. The attack proved highly successful and 59 prisoners were captured along with four field guns and a quantity of German small arms. Against this the battalion lost 17 men killed and 63 wounded.. Following this, they were withdrawn from the front line. By this time casualties amongst the Australian Corps had reached critical level and as a result many battalions‚Äîfrom an authorised strength of over 1,000 men.‚Äîwere only able to field between 300 and 400. As a result, the decision was made to reduce the number of infantry battalions in each brigade from four to three by disbanding one battalion and using its personnel to reinforce the others.. The 29th Battalion was one of those chosen to be broken up and as a result on 19 October 1918, the 29th Battalion was disbanded. The majority of the battalion's personnel‚Äî29 officers and 517 other ranks‚Äîwere transferred to the 32nd Battalion as reinforcements. During its service on the Western Front, the battalion suffered 485 men killed and another 1,399 men wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: three Distinguished Service Orders and one Bar, one Member of the Order of the British Empire, 20 Military Crosses, 17 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 94 Military Medals with three Bars, three Meritorious Service Medals, 17 Mentions in Despatches and five awards from other Allied nations. The 29th Battalion was bestowed 19 battle honours in 1927 for its involvement in the war. =Inter-war years= The battalion was re-raised in 1921 as part the re-organisation of the Australian military that took place at that time,. with the battalion becoming a part-time unit of the Citizen Forces, assigned to the 4th Brigade, 3rd Division.. Upon formation, the battalion drew its personnel from four previously existing Citizen Forces units: the 2nd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment; the 5th Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment; 5th Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment and part of the 29th Light Horse,. and perpetuated the battle honours and traditions of its associated AIF battalion. Based in Melbourne, the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 1,000 men through the compulsory training scheme.. The following year, however, the Army's budget was cut in half and the scope of the scheme reduced following the resolution of the Washington Naval Treaty which arguably improved Australia's strategic outlook. As a result of this, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks and training and recruitment were scaled back significantly.. In 1927, territorial titles were introduced into the Australian Army and the battalion adopted the title of the \\"East Melbourne Regiment\\". At this time, the battalion was afforded the motto Nulli Secundus. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was suspended altogether as it was decided to maintain the part-time military force on a volunteer-only basis.. In order to reflect the change, the Citizen Forces was renamed the \\"Militia\\" at this time.. The end of compulsory training and the fiscal austerity that followed with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower available to many Militia units at this time dropped well below their authorised establishments and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units.. Subsequently, the 29th Battalion was amalgamated with the 22nd in 1930, forming the 29th/22nd Battalion, although they were later split again in August 1939 and the 29th re-raised in its own right. =Second World War and beyond= Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all-volunteer force for service overseas due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903), which precluded compelling the Militia to serve outside of Australian territory. This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF).. Although the 2nd AIF would be raised upon a cadre of trained officers and non-commissioned officers drawn from the Militia, the Militia's main role at this time was to provide training to the men called up as part of the compulsory training scheme that was readopted in early 1940. Throughout 1940‚Äì41 the battalion undertook a number of short periods of continuous training, however, following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and invasion of Malaya in December 1941, it was mobilised for war service. In March 1942, the 4th Brigade was sent to Queensland to undertake garrison duties and man defences along the coast to defend against a possible Japanese invasion. By mid-1942, however, due to manpower shortages that occurred in the Australian economy as a result of over mobilisation of its military forces, the Australian government decided to disband a number of Militia units in order to release their personnel back into the civilian workforce.. As a result of this decision, in August 1942, the 29th Battalion was amalgamated with the 46th Battalion to form the 29th/46th Battalion. This unit went on to serve overseas in New Guinea and on New Britain. After the war, following the demobilisation of the wartime Army, Australia's part-time military was re-formed in 1948,. but the 29th Battalion was not re-raised at the time. In 1961, although the battalion was in a state of suspended animation, it was entrusted with the four battle honours awarded to the 2/29th Battalion for its service in Malaya during World War II and the three earned by the 29th/46th Battalion. Battle honours The 29th Battalion received the following battle honours (including those inherited from the 2/29th): * First World War: Somme 1916, '18; Bapaume 1917; Bullecourt, Ypres 1917; Menin Road; Polygon Wood; Poelcappelle; Passchendaele; Ancre 1918; Amiens; Albert 1918; Mont St Quentin; Hindenburg Line; St. Quentin Canal; France and Flanders 1916‚Äì18; Egypt 1915‚Äì16. * Second World War: Malaya 1941‚Äì42, Johore, The Muar, Singapore Island, South West Pacific 1944‚Äì45, Liberation of Australian New Guinea, Gusika‚ÄìFortification Point.

Many of his portraits of them have been engraved, the best- known being those of Thackeray reading a letter, Carlyle writing at his desk, Harriet lady Ashburton (in Lord Houghton's 'Monographs'), Frederick Denison Maurice, Mrs. Gaskell, Archbishop Trench, and William Edward Forster. His portraits of Tennyson and Carlyle are engraved in Home's 'New Spirit of the Age,' 1844. One of his most successful portraits in oil is that of Leigh Hunt, painted in 1837, but never quite finished. It was exhibited in the National Portrait Exhibition of 1868, and photographed for Leigh Hunt's 'Correspondence,' published in 1862. He died at 6 Wells Street, Oxford Street, London, from the effects of an operation, on 28 February 1884, in the seventy- second year of his age. Family Laurence married Anastasia Gliddon, cousin and adopted sister of Mrs. Thornton Leigh Hunt, and during his early married life he visited Florence and Venice. There, he diligently studied the methods of the old masters, and endeavouring to discover the secrets of their success. In 1854, he visited the United States, and while staying at Longfellow's residence in Massachusetts, he drew a portrait of James Russell Lowell, which has been engraved. Legacy There are by him in the National Portrait Gallery portraits in oil of Charles Babbage and Sir Thomas Bourchier, R.N., and an unfinished head of Thackeray, as well as chalk drawings of Sir Frederick Pollock, bart., and Sir Charles Wheatstone, and an unfinished sketch of Matthew James Higgins ('Jacob Omnium'). The Scottish National Portrait Gallery has a head in crayons of Thomas Carlyle. His portrait of Dr. Whewell is in Trinity College, Cambridge, and one of Thackeray is in the Reform Club, London.

The Center‚Äôs mission is to advance public discussion and public policy research on key issues of democratic governance worldwide, as well as recognize and promote innovations in government that are improving the lives of citizens. The center consists of three major programs: the Program on Democratic Governance, the Innovations in Government Program; and the Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia. History In April 2001, the Ford Foundation announced a $50 million endowment to the Harvard Kennedy School. This endowment was the largest single endowment ever made by the Ford Foundation at that time. Susan Berresford, then president of the Ford Foundation, explained that the endowment would enable much needed recognition of numerous innovative government programs in the United States and worldwide. The grant enabled Harvard Kennedy School to launch the Innovations in American Government Awards in 1985 which recognizes and supports state, local, tribal, and territorial government initiatives. Many past award winners have been replicated around the country including: * CitiStat: As a 2004 Innovations in American Government Award winner, CitiStat launched in 1999 as a tool for improving the performance of Baltimore‚Äôs city government practices. The tool has quickly become an industry standard for driving down costs and improving citizen engagement initiatives: more than 11 U.S. cities have adopted the CitiStat model including SomerStat of Somerville, Massachusetts; ProvStat of Providence, Rhode Island; and PerformanceStat, Los Angeles, California. * Brownfields Economic Redevelopment Initiative: Created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1995, the initiative has allocated more than $500 million to leverage a total of $9.6 billion in cleanup funds, resulting in the assessment of more than 10,000 sites and the comprehensive development of nearly 200 sites that were previously condemned and vacant due to dangerous contamination. The program was a 2000 Innovations in American Government Award winner. * Competition and Costing: While Mayor of Indianapolis in the mid-1990s, Stephen Goldsmith spearheaded a program to privatize city services through managed competition, improving efficiencies and cutting unnecessary costs. ‚ÄúAs a result of the recognition we received from the Innovations Award, we had more than 3,000 officials from around the country and beyond coming to see how we did it,‚Äù said Goldsmith. Mayor Goldsmith went on to serve as the director of the Innovations in Government Program, overseeing the Innovations Awards program. He later served as deputy mayor of New York City. =Roy and Lila Ash= In 2003, Harvard Kennedy School received a substantial gift from benefactors Roy and Lila Ash. Designed to enhance the Innovations in American Government Awards Program by emphasizing the connection between innovation and democratic governance, the gift created the Ash Center. Roy Ash‚Äôs own experience in the public and private sector made him aptly positioned to set the vision for the new Ash Center. Ash served as a cabinet member in two U.S. government administrations and is the founder of the modern Office of Management and Budget. ‚ÄúWe have to consider the concept of democracy fragile and in need of real and constant hands-on care,‚Äù said Roy Ash. ‚ÄúThe purpose of the Institute [now Ash Center] is to encourage thoughtful and focused attention to the nature, principles, functioning, and continued innovation and adaptations essential to a living and effective democracy.\\" Endeavors The Ash Center offers grant funding and internship opportunities for students in the Harvard community. Support for field research in Indonesia and Vietnam, as well as other regions is also offered. Its Ford Foundation Mason Fellowship and Roy and Lila Ash Fellowship provides financial support to students studying at the Harvard Kennedy School. =The Study of Democratic Governance= In November 2008, Harvard Kennedy School announced a new initiative with the Ford Foundation to link innovative governance to the world‚Äôs major social challenges. The Program on Democratic Governance includes research on democratic participation, immigration, and democracy in the developed and developing world. The Center now hosts the Seminar Series, bringing distinguished speakers to Harvard Kennedy School throughout the academic year to address critical challenges facing democratic governance. Its Democracy Fellowships program provides financial support for doctoral and postdoctoral students to pursue research related to democratic governance. =Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia= Under the leadership of Ash Center Director Anthony Saich, Asia Programs, a school-wide initiative integrating Asia-related activities, joined the Ash Center in July 2008. The permanently endowed Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia consisting of Asia Programs was established on January 1, 2010 through support from the Rajawali Foundation in Indonesia. The new Institute is designed to bring together academics and practitioners from around the world to enhance research, teaching, and training on public policy and governance issues of critical importance in Asia. The gift also established the HKS Indonesia Program, which promotes research, education, and capacity building in support of democratic governance and institutional development in Indonesia. Both the Institute for Asia and the HKS Indonesia Program are housed within the Ash Center. Other Institute for Asia programs include its China Public Policy Program, Vietnam Program, and HKS Singapore Program. The Institute also supports Rajawali Fellows, a host of academics and public practitioners with independent research projects relevant to Asia. Its annual China Goes Global Conference examines the impact of the internationalization of Chinese firms. =Innovations in Government Program= In addition to the Innovations in American Government Awards Program, the Innovations in Government Program includes five additional projects that work together to produce a cohesive marketplace for best practices and successful innovations in the public sector. These include the following projects: the Liaison Group for Innovations in Governance and Public Action; the Project on Municipal Innovation; the Forum on Networked Governance; the Social Innovation Project; Better, Faster, Cheaper‚ÄîSmart Ideas for Government; and the Program on Crisis Leadership.

It is a Dutch fort built on top of an existing fort of the Gowa Kingdom. The first fort on the site was constructed by the a local sultan in around 1634, to counter Dutch encroachments. The site was ceded to the Dutch under the Treaty of Bongaya, and they completely rebuilt it between 1673 and 1679. It had six bastions and was surrounded by a seven meter high rampart and a two meter deep moat. The fort was the Dutch regional military and governmental headquarters until the 1930s. It was extensively restored in the 1970s and is now a cultural and educational centre, a venue for music and dance events, and a tourist destination. History Fort Rotterdam was built on the location of an earlier Makassarese fort, called Ujung Pandang. Although it has been claimed by some authors that this fort dates back to 1545, there is no direct evidence for this. It seems more likely that the fort was built in 1634, as part of a fortification programme that the Makassar rulers undertook in response to a war with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) which broke out in that year. The original fort, Jum Pandan (allegedly named after the pandanus trees growing in the vicinity), gave its name to the city Ujung Pandang, another name for the city of Makassar. In 1667 Fort Ujung Pandang was ceded to the Dutch as part of the Treaty of Bongaya, after the defeat of the Sultanate of Gowa in the Makassar War. In subsequent years it was entirely rebuilt on the initiative of Dutch admiral Cornelis Speelman, to become the center of Dutch colonial power in Sulawesi. It was renamed Fort Rotterdam after Speelman's place of birth. In the years 1673‚Äì1679 it got its five bastions and the 'turtle' shape it still has to this day. This shape gave the fort the nickname \\"Benteng Penyu\\" (\\"sea-turtle fort\\"). Fort Rotterdam in late 19th-century. The stone for the construction of the fort was taken from the karst mountains in Maros, the limestone from Selayar and the timber from Tanete and Bantaeng. Following the Java War of 1825‚Äì1830, Javanese prince, and now national hero, Diponegoro was imprisoned in the fort following his exile to Makassar in 1830 until his death in 1855. It was also used as a Japanese prisoner of war camp in World War II. Fort Rotterdam remained the regional Dutch military and governmental headquarters until the 1930s. After 1937, the fort was no longer used as a defense. During the brief Japanese occupation it was used for conducting scientific research in the field of linguistics and agriculture, after which it fell into disrepair. In the 1970s, the fort was extensively restored. Description 18th-century layout of Fort Rotterdam. Fort Rotterdam lies in the centre of Makassar. It is rectangular in shape, surrounded by a seven meter wall. It was originally equipped with six bulwarks, five of which are still visible: Bastion Bonie (after Bone state) to the west; Bastion Boeton (after Buton Island) to the northwest; Bastion Batjang (after the Bacan Islands) to the southwest; Bastion Mandassar to the northeast; and Bastion Amboina (after Ambon) to the southeast. The sixth bulwark, Bastion Ravelin, is no longer visible. Some of the bastions still contain cannons. It is possible to walk over most of the ramparts. A two meter deep moat system used to surround the perimeter of the fort, however only the southwest portion of the moat can still be seen. Current status Inside the fort are thirteen buildings, eleven of them are 17th-century original buildings of the fort; most are still good in condition. At the centre of the fort is a church building. Several buildings along the north and south curtain walls still exist. The buildings along the northern curtain wall were some of the oldest buildings, dating from 1686, such as the residence of the governor, residence of the senior merchant, of the captain, the predikant, and the secretary, with several storage buildings for weapons. The governor's residence at the north-westernmost corner is nicknamed as \\"the Speelman's House\\", however Speelman himself never actually lived in this house. The house was used by the governor of Celebes until the mid 19th-century when he moved to a more comfortable villa in Jalan Ahmad Yani. The Speelman's House now houses part of La Galigo museum. La Galigo museum has some prehistoric megaliths from Watampone, as well as ancient weapons, coins, shells, utensils, sketches and stamps. The buildings on the south curtain, originally used for storage, house a museum displaying local skills in silk weaving, agriculture and boatbuilding; and scale models of indigenous boats. The barracks on the eastern wall now house a small library, featuring old Dutch books that mostly belonged to Reverend Mates, a 19th-century missionary. There are also ships' logs of VOC captains and ancient lontar manuscripts. The department of archaeology is housed in the former building of the head of administration for the VOC; the ground floor of the building, located in the southeast corner of the fort, was formerly a prison. The other two buildings inside Fort Rotterdam were built by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation period. The southwestern Bastion (Bastion Bacan) contains a prison where Prince Diponegoro was imprisoned at the end of his life. The fort is now used to hold various events. There is a conservatory for music and dance, an archive of the city, and a historic and archaeological institute.

Returning to the Belgian Air Force in 1946, Van Lierde was made Deputy Chief of Staff to the Ministre of Defense in 1954. In 1958 he became one of the first Belgians to break the sound barrier while test flying a Hawker Hunter at Dunsfold Aerodrome in England. He went on to hold several important commands before retiring in 1968. Early life Van Lierde was born in Overboelare, Belgium, on 14 August 1915. Early career and outbreak of war Van Lierde entered the Aviation Militaire Belge (\\"Belgian Military Aviation\\", the predecessor of the Belgian Air Force) on 16 September 1935. He first trained as an observer, but began pilot training on 1 May 1937, qualifying in April 1938. He was assigned to the 3rd Squadron, 1st Aviation Regiment. The 3rd Squadron where Remy Van Lierde served at that time was located at Goetsenhoven, in the centre of Belgium. With the rank of sergeant, Van Lierde made several reconnaissance flights during the German invasion in an antiquated Fairey Fox III biplane. He was shot down by flak on 16 May 1940, was wounded and captured. Van Lierde was staying in hospital during two weeks and could not take part in the further fighting because on 28 May Belgium surrendered.of the Month ‚Äì October ‚Äì Colonel Remy ‚ÄúMony‚Äù Van Lierde Retrieved 18 January 2018. In September 1940, after recovering from his injuries, Van Lierde left Belgium, crossed occupied France, and entered neutral Spain. He was arrested for illegally crossing the border, and was confined in various Spanish prisons, including the notorious concentration camp at Miranda de Ebro. Nevertheless, he eventually escaped, and reached England on 22 July 1941. =Career in the Royal Air Force= After the standard interrogation by MI5 at the London Reception Centre, Van Lierde joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 5 September 1941. He spent three months at No. 57 Operational Training Unit at RAF Hawarden, before being assigned to No. 609 Squadron on 6 January 1942 with the rank of pilot officer. This squadron, which had been organized before the war and took part in the Battle of Britain, was entirely staffed by foreign pilots, many Belgians being among them. On 2 June 1942 Van Lierde damaged a Dornier Do 217 bomber over Skegness while flying a Spitfire Mk.Vb. He was promoted to flying officer in 1942. Van Lierde claimed his first victory while flying a Typhoon Ib on 20 January 1943 when he shot down a Bf 109-G fighter during a raid on the south coast. On 26 March he shot down a Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft while en route to an attack on the German air base at Chi√®vres. This was witnessed by local inhabitants, including Van Lierde's wife, who surprised her husband after the war by showing him pieces of wreckage from the aircraft at the bottom of his garden. On 14 May 1943 he was the first person to drop bombs from a Typhoon, and shot down a He 111 bomber on his return journey. He downed another Bf 109 on 30 July, and on 5 October he shot down a Junkers Ju 88 heavy fighter and destroyed another aircraft on the ground. His last victory, a Messerschmitt Bf 110 bomber was claimed on 30 November, bringing his score to 6 kills and 1 destroyed on the ground. By the end of 1943 he was the seventh highest scoring Belgian flying ace of the war. Van Lierde was promoted to flight lieutenant in September 1943 and, on 22 December, was posted to the Central Gunnery School at RAF Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, returning to RAF Manston on 7 February 1944. On 27 April, he was posted to No. 3 Squadron, flying the Tempest Mk.V, before taking command of No. 164 Squadron on 20 August with the rank of squadron leader, tasked with combating the V-1 offensive. He was credited with shooting down or destroying 44 flying bombs solo, with another 9 shared, making him the second highest-scoring \\"doodlebug\\" killer. Van Lierde then led his squadron into Europe during the western campaign. From May 1945 Van Lierde served in 84 Group Support Unit, and as a Belgian Liaison Officer at Second Tactical Air Force Headquarters. Post-war service In August 1945 Van Lierde was given command of No. 350 (Belgian) Squadron, an RAF formation of Belgian pilots flying the Spitfire that was eventually transferred to the Belgian Air Force in October 1946. Commissioned into the Belgian Air Force as a major in June 1946, Van Lierde took command of the 1st Fighter Wing (formed from No. 350 and 349 Squadrons) at Beauvechain Air Base. From October 1947 to November 1950 he was head of the Office of Group Operations, and also studied at the RAF Staff College in 1948. He was appointed Detachment Commander at Chi√®vres Air Base, and then on 1 December 1950 as commander of the 7th Fighter Wing. In 1953 he was appointed to the Operations Group of Chiefs of Staff. Van Lierde was appointed aide to the former King Leopold III in September 1953. In November 1958, with Captain Yves Bodart, Van Lierde travelled to England to test fly a Hawker Hunter at Dunsfold Aerodrome, becoming one of the first Belgian pilots to break the sound barrier. Lieutenant Colonel Van Lierde was made Deputy Chief of Staff to the Minister of Defense in 1954. In 1959, as full colonel, he commanded the air base at Kamina in the Belgian Congo. After the Belgian Congo became independent on 30 June 1960, Van Lierde returned to Belgium and became the Chief of Operations of the Chiefs of Staff and had several other appointments before his retirement in 1968., Belgian Ace Remy Van Lierde.

Alleged encounter with a giant snake On an episode of Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World entitled \\"Dragons, Dinosaurs and Giant Snakes\\", Van Lierde claims that in 1959 he encountered a giant snake in the Katanga region of the Belgian Congo while returning from a mission by helicopter. He claims to have then turned around and made several passes over the snake to allow another person on board to photograph the creature. Van Lierde describes the snake as being close to 50https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX9KSmxCrmI feet in length. He claims it was a dark shade of brown and green with a white coloured belly. He claimed the snake's head was 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, and that the jaws were of a triangular shape. Van Lierde claims that as he flew lower for a closer inspection, the snake rose up approximately 10 feet, giving the impression it would have attacked the helicopter if it had been within striking range.

The song was written by duo partner Chad Stuart with Clive Metcalfe and Keith Noble. Background Like the duo's breakthrough selection, \\"Yesterday's Gone,\\" \\"A Summer Song\\" is a reminiscence of a summer romance. However, \\"A Summer Song\\" eschews the Merseybeat sound of \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" in favor of a gentler folk-influenced arrangement, with the lyrics also being wistful in tone. Stuart recalled on The Steel Pier Radio Show that his \\"A Summer Song\\" collaborators, Clive Metcalfe and Keith Noble, were a musical duo (linked to Pink Floyd) with whom he and Clyde had become friendly and that \\"A Summer Song\\" was written and composed in Stuart's flat in London: \\"We were sitting around jamming on four chords and we came up with 'A Summer Song.'\\" Clive Metcalfe however wrote the tune late one night and Keith later added lyrics. Clive says \\"We performed it one night at Tina's ( a Bistro in Picaddily London) when Chad was visiting. Chad liked the song and later re-wrote the middle, and we all reworked the lyrics, as you hear it today\\". \\"We never thought 'Summer Song' could possibly be a single,\\" Chad recalled another time. \\"It was just a pretty, romantic song. Or so we thought...you never can tell, can you?\\" The selection was one of a number to be included on the Yesterday's Gone album recorded at CTS Studios Bayswater in June 1964 under the production auspices of Shel Talmy, with Johnnie Spence conducting the orchestra. \\"A Summer Song\\" was issued in both the UK and the U.S. in July 1964; the UK single version opens with Chad and Jeremy trading vocals while the U.S. single features unisonant singing throughout. Impact \\"A Summer Song\\" was played on Juke Box Jury where guest judge Ringo Starr assessed the track as a \\"miss\\" (i.e., flop) with no U.S. hit potential. Indeed, in the UK ‚Äì where Chad & Jeremy's \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" had been a rather mild hit, followed by the unsuccessful \\"Like I Love You Today\\" ‚Äì \\"A Summer Song\\" did not reach the charts. This was possibly due to the fact that it was released on a very small label and was largely un-obtainable in the shops! There was an article in NME complaining of this fact. However in, the U.S. ‚Äì following the near-Top 20 success of \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" ‚Äì the track afforded the duo their career record, reaching #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of 17‚Äì24 October 1964. \\"A Summer Song\\" also went to #2 for six weeks on the Adult Contemporary chart. It is considered one of the signature songs of the British Invasion. When Gary James asked him about it, Stuart suggested: \\"The American market was bigger. [...] You'd never hear something that sweet in the British charts. [...] For some reason in America it worked.\\" \\"A Summer Song\\" also reached #7 in Canada and #49 in Australia. The selection is featured on the soundtracks of the films Rushmore (1998), The Princess Diaries (2001), and Men in Black 3 (2012), and was used in the \\"ESPN's Sports Heaven\\" commercial that aired during Super Bowl XL. It appears in a 2019 TV commercial for Coors Light. Remakes The Lettermen covered \\"A Summer Song\\" for their August 1965 Capitol Records album release The Hit Sounds of the Lettermen produced by Steve Douglas. The Lettermen made a second recording of the song for \\"Alive\\" Again...Naturally, a 1973 Capitol Records release which the group self-produced with Ed Cobb. Both versions of \\"A Summer Song\\" by the Lettermen abridged the original three word title to \\"Summer Song.\\" Skeeter Davis's RCA Victor album release Singin' in the Summer Sun, which Chet Atkins and Felton Jarvis produced, included Davis' version of \\"A Summer Song;\\" the album was recorded in January 1966 at RCA Victor Studio in Nashville, Tennessee for release that June. In the summer of 1967, the Doodletown Pipers had an Easy Listening hit with their remake of \\"A Summer Song;\\" produced by Stu Phillips, this Epic Records release reached No. 29 on the Easy Listening charts, affording the group their only chart appearance. Also in 1967, the Memories, an Irish group who became a top showband attraction and scored eight domestic chart hits, remade \\"A Summer Song\\" as their debut single, released on Rex Records. A version of \\"A Summer Song\\"1 by Laila Kinnunen was issued by Mediamusiikki in 2000 on the compilation CD Muistojen Kyyneleet, which featured selections Kinnunen had recorded with the Erkki Melakoski (fi) orchestra for the Yleisradio TV series Kuukauden Suositut, Kinnunen's performance of \\"A Summer Song\\" having been prepped to air in that series' 1966 season. The 1998 Narada album Songs From an English Garden by David Lanz features an instrumental version of A Summer Song. New York based folkie Christine Lavin included the song on her 1986 LP Beau Woes and Other Problems of Modern Life. A French rendering of \\"A Summer Song\\" entitled \\"Souviens-toi des nuits d'√©t√©\\" was introduced in 1965 by Frank Alamo on the Rivi√®ra label; the B-side of Alamo's single \\"Qu'est-ce Que Peut Bien Faire Un Gar√ßon,\\" \\"Souviens-toi des nuits d'√©t√©\\" was also included on a four track EP and was subsequently included on the singer's 1966 self-titled album release. \\"Souviens-toi des nuits d'√©t√©\\" was also recorded by Line Renaud, her rendition being included on a four track 1966 EP release by Disques Line.

The company currently operates in a total of 30 markets around the world and is headquartered in Paris, France. On April 7, 2011, Criteo announced that it hired Greg Coleman as president. Previously, Coleman served as president and chief revenue officer of The Huffington Post and executive vice president of global sales for Yahoo!.http://www.digiday.com/data/stories/why-greg-coleman-bet-on- retargeting/ Criteo enables online businesses to follow up visitors who have left their website without making a purchase using personalized banners which aim to drive potential customers back to the business website. History Criteo was founded in Paris, France in 2005 by Jean-Baptiste Rudelle, Franck Le Ouay and Romain Niccoli. Criteo spent the first four years focused on R&D;, and launched its first product in April 2008. In 2010, Criteo opened an office in Silicon Valley in an effort to enhance its profile in the USA. In 2012, Criteo opened its new headquarters in Paris, France establishing one of the biggest European R&D; centers dedicated to predictive advertising. The center will continue to provide central support to more than 30 markets worldwide, on five continents ‚Äì North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. In September 2013, the firm filed for an IPO with US regulators to raise up to $190 million. In October 2017, Criteo appointed Mollie Spilman as COO. Product Criteo's product is a form of display advertising. Their personalized retargeting solution displays interactive banner advertisements, generated based on the online retail browsing preferences and products for each customer. The solution operates on a pay per click/cost per click (CPC) basis, meaning that advertisers pay only for the consumers that click on the banner and return to their website. Additional retargeting solutions operate on a cost per thousand impressions (CPM) or cost per engagement (CPE) basis. The most common, and simple form of retargeting is basic static retargeting, where a single static banner is shown to all viewers who have left a particular website. Retargeting specialists then introduced a slightly more complex form of segmented retargeting.http://www.itvent.com/aggregator/sources/1?page=8 This second generation of retargeting revolves around hyper relevant dynamic creative banners based on each unique user's shopping behavior. In September 2010, Criteo debuted its self-service cost-per-click (CPC) bidding platform that lets advertisers place bids on display retargeting campaigns and see changes and optimize campaigns in real-time. In May, 2016, Criteo launched its dynamic email retargeting to increase potential reach.http://www.criteo.com/news/press-releases/2016/05/criteo-helps- marketers-boost-incremental-sales-with-dynamic-email-retargeting/ The Criteo Performance Optimization Platform allowed display advertisers and agencies to set retargeting campaigns based on category, and allow advertisers to bid a different CPC per product category. This is similar to Google AdWords, but for display retargeting ads. Criteo‚Äôs platform allowed for cost-per-click bids to be set down to the individual product level. For example, if a retargeted ad displays three products the consumer had browsed on the site, a different cost can be assigned to each product displayed within the single ad. Funding Criteo has secured a total of $17 million in funding, with 3M ‚Ç¨ in a first institutional round in March 2006 coming from French private equity firm AGF and Elaia Partners, and 9M ‚Ç¨ in a second round in January 2008 led by Index Ventures. The company displays over 4 billion banners per month but does not disclose the geographical breakdown for those banners. In May 2010, Criteo raised a further $7 million of funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the total to $24 million. WXP Privacy In September 2010, Criteo began a campaign regarding the use of the popular retargeting and its impact on consumer privacy. The campaign aimed to reassure consumers about personalized retargeting and data-driven marketing tactics. The company denies it relies on personally identifiable information (PII) and doesn‚Äôt track identifiable information, no data is shared with advertisers or publishers and no third-party data used for targeting purposes. Retargeting only uses anonymous information from the merchant‚Äôs site. In 2019, Privacy International filed a complaint against Criteo, citing that it wouldn't respect the European GDPR. Achievements Criteo won the 2010 Web Award for Outstanding Achievement in Web Development.

A notable member was Theodore Roosevelt, who regularly attended services there during his term as United States president.‚ÄúGrace Reformed Church‚Äù The congregation was originally organized in 1877 as a member of the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS), which eventually merged into the United Church of Christ (UCC).‚ÄúUnited Church Of Christ, Washington Grace Reformed Church‚Äù Construction on the current building began in 1902, with then-Vice President Roosevelt laying the cornerstone; he also gave an address at its 1903 dedication.

Christ Reformed Church (URCNA) rented space in the building from approximately 2011 to the end of 2019. In 2016, Christ Reformed was told that its rental agreement would soon be ending to facilitate a likely sale of the building. Christ Reformed announced its new location in December 2019. The Community Church of Washington, D.C. (CCWDC) also holds services in the building. Like the original Grace Reformed, it is a congregation of the United Church of Christ. As of December 2019, CCWDC had not yet formal plans to vacate the property.

National Register of Historic Places. Record Number: 415986 National Register of Historic Places 2010-11-15.  History  Grace Reformed Church, located in Washington D.C., was organized with 14 charter members on October 7, 1877. The church traces its roots to the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland in the 16th century. The congregation was established for English-speaking Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS) believers.\\"The Reformed Church in the United States.\\" Almanac and Year Book for the Reformed Church in the United States. Cleveland, Ohio: Central Publishing House, 1913. Grace Reformed Church was initially supported as a mission church by the Maryland Classis, the governing body of the Reformed Church in the region. Most RCUS congregations merged with the Evangelical Synod of North America (ESNA) to form the Evangelical and Reformed Church (E&R;) of the United States in 1934.\\"History and Program: United Church of Christ.\\" New York: United Church Press, 1986. That denomination, in turn, merged in 1957 with the majority of the Congregational Christian Churches (CC) to form the present-day United Church of Christ (UCC). = Theodore Roosevelt and Grace Reformed Church = Theodore Roosevelt was a member of Grace Reformed church while President of the United States. Roosevelt originally belonged to the Reformed Church in America (RCA), a Dutch-American group. As a private person, Roosevelt attended religious services wherever he was. He preferred the Reformed Church if one were available to attend and is reported to have said, \\"I take a sentimental satisfaction in worshiping in the Church of my fathers.\\" Since there were no RCA congregations in Washington, he chose Grace Reformed Church as a church similar liturgically and theologically to Dutch Calvinism. Roosevelt began attending Grace Reformed Church soon after his arrival in Washington, D.C. in 1901 as Vice-President of the United States. Reverend Dr. J.M. Schick, Pastor of Grace Reformed Church between 1900 and 1913, invited Roosevelt to make the church his home. Roosevelt did so and attended church regularly during his eight years in Washington. The President often walked from the White House to attend Sunday morning worship services at Grace Church. The President was usually accompanied by two Secret Service men, and often with family members or friends. He regularly had flowers sent to adorn the altar from the greenhouse at the White House and was a faithful communicant between 1901 and 1909. Roosevelt is reported to have taken part in all the service, singing every hymn, and listening to the sermon, even jotting down notes on the sermons. His regular pew is still in the church. Roosevelt's appreciation for the spiritual support that he received from his church attendance was communicated by letters he sent to the pastor as well as the gifts of two bishop chairs and his portrait to the church. President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone of Grace Reformed Church on July 1, 1902 and spoke at its dedication on June 7, 1903.\\"The Address of President Roosevelt at the Dedication of Grace Reformed Church, Washington, D.C.\\" Reformed Church Messenger. June 11, 1903. As his speech at the dedication ceremony of Grace Reformed Church concluded: :\\"This church is consecrated here to-day to duty and service, to the worship of the Creator, and to an earnest effort on our part so to shape our lives among ourselves and in relation to the outside world that we may feel that we have done our part in ringing a little nearer the day when there shall be on this earth a genuine brotherhood of man.\\" President Dwight D. Eisenhower attended a special Sunday morning worship service at Grace Reformed Church in October 1958 that commemorated the 100th birthday anniversary of Theodore Roosevelt.\\"100th Anniversary of Grace Reformed Church 1877-1977.\\" York, Pennsylvania: Printing by Printing Plate Craftsmen, n.d.  Structure  The \\"Grace Reformed Church, Sunday School and Parish House\\" was constructed between 1892 and 1903. Grace Reformed Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Located on 15th Street, N.W. in Washington, D.C., Grace Reformed Church comprises three buildings: the Church or Sanctuary; the Sunday School; and the Parish House. The Church, designed by Paul J. Pelz and A. A. Ritcher, was constructed between 1902‚Äì1903. The Sunday School, also designed by Pelz, was constructed from 1911‚Äì1912. The Parish House, preceding both religious structures, was erected in 1892 by W. H. H. Knight, a member of the congregation. The three structures are situated so that the Parish House and Church front 15th Street, N.W. while the Sunday School, abutting the Church to the east, faces onto an alley which was originally intended as O Street, N.W. The architectural style is Late Gothic Revival. The exterior design, with its stone shields of Zurich and Geneva and stone heads of the knight and burgher, symbolizes the history of the Reformed Church. The interior contains seven colorful stained-glass windows depicting the life of Christ from the Visit of the Magi to the Ascension. National Register of Historic Places, Registration Form NFS OMB No. 1024-0018 = History = In 1880, the Maryland Classis purchased the current site of Grace Reformed Church at 1405 15th Street and in 1881, a chapel was constructed. Designed in the Queen Anne style, the chapel was built at a cost of $4,100 at the rear of the lot on 15th Street, reserving the front portion of the lot for a church. In 1892, the Parish House was built. The name listed on the permit to build as architect was W.H.H. Knight, known to have been a member of the congregation.National Archives and Record Administration. Record Group 351, D.C. Building Permits. In 1899, it was felt that the Reformed Church denomination needed a new church located in Washington, D.C., to be a national symbol of the denomination and to strengthen its outreach in the nation's capital. The Board of Home Missions in the Maryland Classis challenged the entire Reformed Church in the United States to raise money to build \\"a suitable church on that fine lot.\\"Bishop, Pamela and Kidwell, Robert W. \\"Appraisal Report of Grace Reformed Church.\\" Washington, D.C. August 29, 1979. Money and support began to be collected from members of Reformed congregations throughout the United States. The decision of President Theodore Roosevelt to worship at the church added to the significance of the building's role in representing the denomination in the nation's capital. These sentiments were summed up by the Reformed Church Messenger, the denomination's newspaper, on the occasion of the dedication of the church in 1903: :In erecting this building the Reformed Church has done an appropriate thing in a beautiful way. The denomination would have aided the Washington Church, in any event, in erecting a house of worship. But the coming of President Roosevelt to worship with our Reformed people gave new life as well as new significance to the movement to erect a new church in Washington. ... In the first place, the church building is one of which the Reformed Church may be proud. No picture yet printed has given an adequate idea of the beauty of the structure. Within and without it is as beautiful and artistic as it is substantial and complete. The finished structure reflects credit on all who have had anything to do with its erection. Any member of the church visiting Washington will find a church of which he may be proud. Neither in Washington nor elsewhere will be found a building which so appropriately and so adequately meets the purpose of its erection. It stands as a monument first of all to the power and grace of the kingdom of Jesus Church but it represents at the same time the history and genius of the Reformed Church. (June 11, 1903) The article further emphasized the significance of the choice of the Gothic Revival style to represent the Reformed movement: :The style of architecture; the shields of Geneva, Zurich and the Palatinate; the emblems cut into stone arches over the entrances to the church and the memorials in the windows and the chancel, combine to make one harmonious story easily understood by anyone who knows the Reformed Church. (June 11, 1903)Washington Architectural Club Catalog. Washington, D.C: Corcoran Gallery of Art, 1901,1903, 1906. = Construction = Designs for Grace Reformed Church in Washington, D.C., were begun in 1901, after an agreement was reached and signed between architects Paul J. Pelz and A. A. Ritcher and the Building Committee of Maryland Classis. Specifications detailing the contractor's responsibilities and the building materials to be used were drawn up and signed by Pelz in April 1902, while a contract between the church and the builders, Richardson and Burgess of Washington, D.C., was signed in May 1902. The D.C. Building Permit (D.C. Permit #2052, 06/07/1902) was filed in June 1902. President Theodore Roosevelt laid the cornerstone on July 1 of the same year. According to the building specifications, the church was of fireproof construction. Several types of materials were used on the building, including stone, brick, iron, copper, tin and slate. The stone facing was specified as Amherst Grey Canyon, supplied by the Cleveland Stone Company. All roofs were covered with Matthews Vermont slate and all cornice gutters were lined with McClure's IX Genuine Charcoal Iron redipped Tin. The hardware was specified from the Catalogue of the Reading Hardware Company, and the doors and their frames were to be red birch, inside and out. In early 1903, the exterior walls were erected and the sculptural ornamentation was being completed. By early April, the interior of the church was being finalized. At this time, the wainscoting was almost complete, one-third of the floor was laid, a three-manual organ had been purchased, and final preparations were beginning for the dedication ceremony scheduled or June 1903. The architect and contractors had not fully completed their contract by the dedication ceremony, however. On July 25, 1903 a piece of copper work in the alley side cornice had come loose. On July 28 the copper cornice was repaired and the building finally completed.  The Architect: Paul J. Pelz  Paul J. Pelz, architect of Grace Reformed Church in association with A. A. Ritcher, and architect alone for the Sunday School Building, is best known in Washington, D. C. for his design of the Library of Congress. Pelz was also responsible for Georgetown University's Healy Hall, Riggs Memorial Library, and Medical Department; the Carnegie Library and Music Hall at Allegheny (now part of Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania; the Chamberlain Hotel at Fort Monroe, Virginia; the Government Hospital Buildings at Hot Springs, Arkansas; and the Hospital and Administration Buildings at the University of Virginia; and a great many private residences. Judging from the correspondence between Pelz and the Building Committee during the construction of Grace Reformed Church, Pelz became inspired by the Reformed Church and its philosophies. He studied the history of the church and made an effort to incorporate sculptural elements on the church which were symbolic of the Reformation movement and the Reformed Church. He took pride in the symbolic aspect of the church which had been artistically carved by sculptor James F. Earley and considered Grace Reformed Church, upon completion, \\"more artistic than any church in this city.\\" In May 1903 a letter from Pelz to Reverend Slagle indicates that, as the church was nearing completion, Pelz was happy with the results. Pelz wrote, \\"I am truly proud of my work having striven hard to make ends meet. I was [,] through your confidence and liberality with what you could command...enabled to make the very best use of your money and have given you a thoroughly well digested, well built edifice. To the builders belongs great credit for having entered into the spirit which moved me with enthusiasm, and I am prone to say that I have sent my own inspiration down to the very hearts of all the workmen from the foreman down the chain to the very hod carriers and laborers, who are to day proud of having worked on your church...\\" In his last official letter to Reverend Slagle, dated August 11, 1903, Pelz recognized the church's artistic value. He wrote, \\"The church itself is a creation to which I look with much pride. Your liberality permitted me to make it more artistic than any church in this city, and I think of few churches in the United States which have a more artistic development. The quality of the sculptural work you permitted me to apply is of a high grade and should lead to emulation by other denominations for their memorial churches, if their building committees are intelligent enough to rise to the understanding required.\\" Pelz's relationship with Grace Reformed Church did not end with the completion of the church. Eight years later, he was retained as the architect of the Sunday School Building which replaced the original Queen Anne chapel. Pelz's design for the Sunday School was executed again in the Gothic Revival style. This choice of style unified the new Sunday School Building with the design of the original church.  A. A. Ritcher  A. A. Ritcher of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, was also responsible for the design of Grace Reformed Church. It is not known why the two architects collaborated on the design of the building. Although not as active in overseeing construction at the church as Pelz, Ritcher did receive half of the architects' fees, indicating that his role was more than minimal. Very little is known about Ritcher. He was born in Philadelphia in 1873 and died in 1925. He was a member of the firm Ritcher and Eiler, specialists in school design. He was a member of the Historical Society in Lebanon, Pennsylvania in 1911 and is listed as the architect with Beard Construction Company.  The Sculptor: James F. Earlev  James F. Earley was responsible for the sculptural work on Grace Reformed Church. A fourth or fifth generation stone carver, James F. Earley, was born in Birmingham, England in 1856 and studied sculpture at the Royal Academy in London.Cron, Frederick. The Man Who Made Concrete Beautiful. Fort Collins, Colorado: Centennial Publications, 1977.Falk, Peter Hastings, ed. Who Was Who in American Art. Soundview Press, 1985. Between 1892 and his death in 1906, James F. Earley was responsible for much sculpture found on private residences, commercial and religious structures in Washington, D.C. Some of his particular pieces include the marble pulpit at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church, the altar and statues at the Franciscan Monastery in Brookland (which won him a medal by Pope Leo XIII), and the marble relief on the Evening Star Building. Outside of Washington, James F. Earley was especially known for his work on the U.S. Government Building at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904. Other works of James F. Earley include ornamental detail on the U. S. Custom House in Baltimore; a fountain at the U.S. Custom House at the Lewis and Clark Centennial in Portland, Oregon; a garland on the U. S. Post Office in Cumberland, Maryland, and Eagles for lamps at the U. S. Post Office in Salem, Oregon (The Washington Architectural Club Catalog 1901, 1903 and 1906). James Farrington Earley's last known work was a memorial at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Earley's sculpture for Grace Reformed Church included much of the stone ornamentation on the exterior of the building, including the carved tympanums above the central door and two side doors; the figure supporting the banner of Frederick, the Elector of the Palatinate; the shields located at either side of the central door, and the heads of the Knight and Burgher serving as label-stops. Paul Pelz praised Earley's work and was pleased at learning \\"that you [the Chairman of the Building Committee] are pleased with my endeavor to make your church the most artistic in the city\\" (Letter from Paul Pelz to Mr. Slagle, February 9, 1903). The sculptural work on the church was entirely completed, at a discount rate of $1,000.00, by early April, 1903.  Architecture  Designed in the Late Gothic Revival style, Grace Reformed Church is rectangular in plan with vertical emphasis given by its soaring towers and spires. The church sits upon a granite base and measures 52 feet wide and 71 feet high. It is constructed of Cleveland greystone with much sculptural ornamentation decorating the facade. The facade of the church is three bays wide and fronts 15th Street, while the side (south elevation), consisting of two end gables connected by five bays, extends along the alley. The 15th Street facade consists of a tall, projecting bay with a gable roof flanked by two, shorter side bays covered with cross gable roofs. Octagonal towers topped with delicate spires located at the corners of the central bay articulate this central element and provide a vertical emphasis to the church. A door with a pointed arch pediment is located on center of the central bay with small, pointed arch side lights flanking it. The tympanum above the door is in relief and depicts the Ascension of Christ. Two sculpted Shields representing Geneva and Zurich appear above the side lights. Above the central door and occupying the entire width of the central bay is a large, five-paneled, stained glass tracery window. The window is enclosed within a pointed arch label-molding with label-stops sculpted in the form of two heads representing a burgher and a knight. Above the central window and within the gable is a pointed arch niche within which rests a figure supporting the shield of Frederick, the Elector of the Palatinate, and symbol of the Reformed Church. A sculpted electorate cross terminates the top of the gable, while the spires of the corner towers project slightly higher. The two side bays are identical. Both consist of a central door with carved tympanums, and stained glass, rose windows above, all set within a pointed arch surround. Blind galleries surmount the pointed arch and form a frieze below the cornice line. Square buttresses in plan terminate the ends of the church and extend from the ground to slightly above the roof line of the end bays. Niches are located at the midpoint and at the top of the buttresses. A copper gutter and a copper ridge line are visible at the roof level of the end bays. The South elevation facing the wide alley consists of two gables, one at the west end, the other at the east end, connected by five identical bays, two stories in height. The west bay is part of the church building itself, while the east bay represents the facade of the Sunday School Building, constructed after the completion of the sanctuary. The west gable is pierced by a tracery window, composed of two paneled lancet windows with a rose window above. Sculpted panels of blind arcading interrupt the lancets at a level one-third the height of the window. Pointed label moulds with carved label-stops surround the tracery to protect the windows from the weather. The five bays connecting the east and west gabled ends are identical except for the fifth bay from the west which holds a door at its ground level. Each bay, separated by pilasters, contains a tracery window. Projecting modillions support an unornamented frieze and cornice. These bays are covered with a gable roof supporting three copper dormers with ornamental hoods. The entrance to the church occurs on center at the 15th Street elevation. A small, wood-paneled entry vestibule opens onto the central aisle of the church with the raised altar at the east end adjacent to a raised choir stand slightly to its north. The doors on either side of the central entrance similarly open onto an extension of the wooden entry vestibule, leading church goers up the stairs to the balcony level, or onto the main floor. A wide, contoured balcony, supported by cast iron columns, extends the entire width of the church across the west end. Two groups of pews are located to either side of a central aisle at the balcony level. The interior of the church is a large, open area with a central aisle and very narrow side aisles located between the pews and end walls. The central nave of the church soars a full three stories high, terminating at the raised altar at the east end. The east wall of the altar holds a Sacramental mosaic, beyond a high arch supported by clustered columns with foliated capitals. The sides, vaulted at a lower level than the central aisle, are separated from it by a wooden entablature extending from the altar to the balcony. Wooden ribs, at each bay, extend from the entablature and follow the vaulted ceiling of the aisles to rest on sculpted brackets of stone on the exterior end walls. The brackets are visually supported by pilasters which also serve to delineate the separate bays of the side elevations. The south and west walls display the lancet windows of stained glass. The north wall has two lancets with no glazing (where the north wall of the church is abutting the south wall of the Parish house), and two lancets with stained glass windows. There are a total of eight stained glass windows in the church presenting a series of scenes from the life of Christ, beginning, along the south wall of the church, with the visit of the Magi at His birth, and culminating, at the large, five-paneled lancet window on center of the west wall, with the Ascension of Christ. The window artistry was done by Conroy and Prugh of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. = The Sunday School = The Sunday School Building, abutting the church at its east end, is rectangular in plan, measuring 72 feet long and 35 feet 5¬Ω inches wide. The east gable of the south elevation of the church, and facade of the Sunday School Building, is covered with Cleveland greystone and repeats the style and elements of the west gable of the church, but in a manner more appropriate to the school's function. The east gable, 3¬Ω stories tall, is divided into three parts, consisting of a slightly projecting central portion rising to the apex of the gable and flanked by wings. The entire gabled bay is highly fenestrated, not with tracery windows, but with casement windows at each level. Six sculpted tympanums with the names of important Reformed Church leaders appear above the window openings of the Sunday School Building. The names of \\"Zwingli\\" and \\"Calvin\\", the founders of the Reformed Church, are carved in the tympanums of the windows located on the third floor of the center bay with two fish sculpted next to them. The fish was a popular symbol of Christianity because the five letters of the Greek word for fish are the initials for the expression \\"Jesus Christ, son of God Savior\\". The names of \\"Bullinger\\" and \\"Beza\\", the successors of Zwingli and Calvin in Zurich and Geneva, appear at the second floor level in the side bays of the Sunday School facade. At the basement level of the central bay are the names of the authors of the Reformed Church Catechism, \\"Ursinus\\", the theologian, and \\"Olevianus\\", the court preacher at Heidelberg. Small rectangular openings are located at the gable above the Chi-Rho sculpture, a symbol associated with the Roman Emperor Constantine and his becoming a Christian in the fourth century. A highly ornate finial tops the apex of the gable. Piers decorated with pointed arch niches, as found on the front facade of the church, buttress the edges of the central portion and ends of the wings of this east gable. The east side elevation of the Sunday School Building faces a narrow, 10-foot alley. This elevation, not visible to the public, is brick, with no sculptural decoration. The elevation is not completely unornamented, however, as the casement windows of the first and second floors are recessed within pointed arches extending the full two stories. The third floor similarly has casement windows but which are flush with the facade. The north rear elevation of the Sunday School Building faces the rear parking area directly behind the Parish House next door. This elevation, also of brick, has a central gable and two end chimneys. The third level is fenestrated with four casement windows flush with the facade, while recessed windows at the first and second levels (infilled with brick on the first floor) are set within five separate, pointed arches. Small, rectangular, fixed windows appear at the attic level of the gable. Two brick chimneys, on either side of the gable, terminate the ends of this east elevation. The interior of the Sunday School Building can be accessed from either the door on the exterior facade, or from an interior door located at the back wall of the sanctuary. Both of these doors open onto an entry vestibule which in turn opens onto a foyer. From the foyer, a set of double doors lead into the \\"Roosevelt Room\\" and stairs ascend to the conference room and Sunday School classrooms. The Roosevelt Room, which is used for meetings and social events, is square in plan and incorporates into its east side wall the cornerstone of the original Grace Reformed Church Chapel on this same site. A vitrine contains Theodore Roosevelt memorabilia. The conference room, rectangular in plan, extends a full two stories in height with a balcony level consisting of the Sunday School class rooms. A central, wooden speaker's platform is located at the west end of the room with movable seating in front. A semicircular balcony level, located above the platform, is accessed by wooden stairs at either side of the speaker's podium. A narrow walkway is located between the balcony railing and the irregular shaped classrooms divided off behind. The classrooms, placed in the poche, formed by the intersection of the semicircle and the rectangle, are partitioned by rolling slat doors. The design of this classroom and conference area is referred to as \\"Akron-style\\", since the first Sunday School of this type, designed in the late 1860s by Lewis Miller, was built in Akron, Ohio. = Parish House = The Parish House is a three-story brick structure with a two-story projecting bay. The central entrance door and vestibule is located next to the bay, towards the north end. The projecting bay has paired rectangular windows with a segmental transom light above on the first floor, and paired, segmental arched windows on the second floor. A segmental arched window is located at the second floor of the main block, while three rectangular windows are located at the third floor. The central window is covered with a triangular brick pediment and the side windows have jack arches. Decorative string courses are located at each of the levels and inset brick panels can be found between the basement and first floor and between the first floor and the second floors. The cornice of both the projecting bay and main block is corbelled and supports a flat roof.  References  Category:United Church of Christ churches in Washington, D.C.

It ended in a victory for the North Korean forces after they were able to push troops of the United States and South Korea out of the area. Republic of Korea Army (ROK) units had been unsuccessfully resisting advances by the North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) in the region when they were reinforced by the United States Army's 25th Infantry Division, newly arrived in the country. In the subsequent fight, the 25th Infantry Division was able to inflict substantial casualties on the advancing KPA 15th Infantry Division but was not able to hold its positions. In 11 days of fighting, the UN forces performed poorly and were forced to withdraw from Yechon County, the city of Sangju, and the surrounding areas. The 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division was ineffective in its first showing. The regiment, composed mostly of African-American troops, was criticized by the Army for being quick to panic and retreat. Some historians have described the Army's statements as biased, downplaying the regiment's successes and overstating its failures.  Background  = Outbreak of war = Following the invasion of the South Korea by North Korea, the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict in support of South Korea. The United States subsequently sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II in 1945, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea. The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial \\"shock\\" of North Korean advances, fighting alone and outnumbered for several weeks They delayed much larger KPA units while additional UN forces arrived and moved into position: the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division and other Eighth Army supporting units. ROK forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea's east coast, with entire divisions being overrun by the KPA's superior firepower and equipment. Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the KPA's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, being almost completely destroyed but delaying KPA forces from advancing until July 20. By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region at around 70,000 for each side, with new UN units arriving every day. = US 25th Infantry Division arrives = At the same time, on the east coast, the KPA 12th Division was resting from its heavy battles north of the town of Sangju, a crossroads center for all the mountain roads in that part of Korea. Situated south of the Mun'gyong plateau and the dividing watershed between the Han River and the Naktong River, Sangju had a commanding position in the valley of the Naktong, northeast of Taegu. There was a large amount of confused activity around Sangju during the end of July, as refugees and stragglers from the defeated ROK poured south through the town. Many ROK units were retreating to Sangju and some had passed south through it. Isolated fighting had already begun between KPA and ROK forces for control of the Mun'gyong plateau when the 25th Infantry Division under Major General William B. Kean, newly arrived in Korea on July 10‚Äì15, received orders from Eighth Army Commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker to concentrate there to bolster ROK defenses of the central mountain corridors. General Walker looked to the 25th Division to help the ROK forces in central Korea prevent a major KPA movement into the valley of the upper Naktong. The division stood at a strength of 13,059 as of July 19.  Battle  = Capture of Yechon = US artillery fires on North Korean targets. The first action between elements of the 25th Division and the KPA took place at Yechon on July 20. Company K, 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment, led by First Lieutenant Jasper R. Johnson, entered the town during the afternoon. When other units of the 3rd Battalion failed to take a ridge overlooking the town on the left, he requested and received permission to withdraw from the town for the night. Meeting at the battalion command post, the commanders of the US units planned a renewed assault for 05:00 the next morning. Artillery and mortars fired on the town ahead of the infantry advance, and soon the town was on fire from the shells. By this time, however, Yechon had likely been abandoned by the North Koreans. At Hamch'ang, Colonel Henry G. Fisher, commanding the 35th Infantry Regiment, received an erroneous message early that morning stating that the KPA had driven the 24th Infantry from Yechon. He immediately left for Yechon. He found the battalion commander about west of the town, but was dissatisfied with the information that he received from him. Fisher and a small party then drove on into Yechon, which was still burning. He encountered no North Korean troops or South Korean civilians. The 3rd Platoon, 77th Engineer Combat Company, attached to Company K, entered the town with the infantrymen and attempted to halt the spread of flames but were unable to do so because of high, shifting winds. The 24th Infantry then met light resistance from North Korean troops counterattacking the town, but drove them off, securing the town after several hours of fighting at a cost of 2 killed and 12 wounded. North Korean casualties at the fight could not be estimated. However, the US Army, preoccupied by the Battle of Taejon, took little notice and credited the victory to the South Koreans. News of the capture was picked up by the US media as the first fight won by black soldiers of the mostly black unit. By 13:00 Yechon was secured, and 3rd Battalion turned over control of the town to the ROK 18th Regiment of the Capital Division. The Capital Division then concentrated the bulk of its forces there, and opposed the KPA 8th Division in that vicinity the remainder of the month. = Drawing battle lines = Major General Kean and his 25th Division had to guard two main approaches to Sangju to keep the town from falling to the North Koreans. The main road crossed the Mun'gyong plateau and passed through Hamch'ang at the base of the plateau about north of Sangju. Next, there was a secondary mountain road that crossed the plateau farther west and, once through the mountains, turned east toward Sangju. On the main road, the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, held a blocking position northwest of Hamch'ang, supported by a platoon of tanks from A Company, 78th Tank Battalion, and A Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion. The 1st Battalion was emplaced with the 2nd Battalion but stayed less than 24 hours before it was sent to reinforce the US 27th Infantry Regiment on the next north‚Äìsouth line of communications westward. Thus, in effect, one battalion of US troops stood behind ROK units on the Hamch'ang approach. On the second road, that leading into Sangju from the west, the 24th Infantry Regiment assembled two, and later all three, of its battalions. The 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry took up a hill position northwest of Hamch'ang and south of Mun'gyong on the south side of a stream that flowed past Sangju to the Naktong. On the north side of the stream an ROK battalion held the front line. Brigadier General Vennard Wilson, the 25th's Assistant Division Commander, ordered F Company of the battalion to be inserted in the center of the ROK line north of the stream, and this was done over the strong protests of the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins. Wilson thought the American troops would strengthen the ROK defense, but Wilkins did not want the untried company to be dependent on ROK stability in its first engagement. Behind the ROK and F Company positions the ground rose to another hill within small arms range. Heavy rains had swollen the stream behind the ROK and F Company positions to a torrent that was rolling large boulders along its channel. In the meantime, the ROK 2nd Battalion, 17th Regiment, ambushed a battalion of North Korean troops near Tongkwanri, forcing it to withdraw. = North Korean attack on Sangju = On July 22 the North Koreans attacked. The ROK troops resisted briefly, but withdrew from their positions on either side of F Company without communicating their intentions. The withdrawal had been a part of the plan for reorganizing the line to incorporate the US troops, but F Company expected them to send a message before doing so, and did not adjust their defenses to compensate. North Korean troops quickly flanked F Company and began attacking it from the rear. This precipitated an unorganized withdrawal. The swollen stream prevented F Company from crossing to the south side and the 2nd Battalion positions. Walking wounded crowded along the stream where an effort to get them across failed. Two officers and two noncommissioned officers tied a pair of twisted telephone wires about their bodies and tried to swim to the other bank and fasten a line, but each in turn was swept downstream where they floundered ashore on the same bank where they had started. Some men drowned trying to cross the swollen river. The covering fire of a platoon of tanks on the south side held off the North Koreans and allowed most of the survivors to eventually escape. F Company lost 37 men: 6 killed, 10 wounded, and 21 missing. The next morning five North Korean T-34 tanks crossed the river and moved toward Hamch'ang. Artillery fire from A Battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion knocked out four of the tanks immediately. The fifth moved back across the river, where an air strike later destroyed it. = UN consolidates around Sangju = The 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, was still in its position when it received orders to withdraw to a point north of Sangju on July 23. On July 28 the battalion fell back further, and the next day it moved to a position south of Sangju. On the last day of July, the 35th Infantry was ordered to a blocking position on a line of hills south of Sangju on the Kumch'on road. In 11 days it had fallen back about on the Sangju front without encountering strong resistance, only North Korean patrols. During the battle, the 35th Infantry merely executed a series of withdrawals on division orders as the front around it collapsed, and was not heavily involved in the fighting. The ROK 6th Division continued its hard- fought action on the road through the mountains from Mun'gyong, but gradually it fell back from in front of the KPA 1st Division. In the mountains above Hamch'ang the ROK 6th Division on July 24 destroyed seven North Korean T-34 tanks. Three days later the ROK 1st Division, now relieved northwest of Sangju by the US 24th Infantry and redeployed on the Hamch'ang front, destroyed four more tanks there with 2.36-inch bazookas and captured one tank intact. The remnants of the ROK 2nd Division, relieved by the 27th Infantry Regiment on the Hwanggan‚ÄìPoun road, were incorporated into the ROK 1st Division. Thus, by July 24 the US 25th Division had taken over from the ROK 1st and 2nd Divisions the sector from Sangju westward to the Seoul‚ÄìTaegu highway, and these ROK troops were moving into the line eastward and northward from Sangju on the Hamch'ang front. By July 27 all the Mun'gyong divide was in North Korean possession and their units were moving into the valley of the upper Naktong in the vicinity of Hamch'ang. Prisoners taken at the time and others captured later said that the KPA 1st Division suffered 5,000 casualties in the struggle for control of the divide, including the division commander who was wounded and replaced. The KPA 13th Division, following the 1st, suffered about 500 casualties below Mun'gyong, but otherwise it was not engaged during this period. The KPA 15th Division, one of North Korea's weaker divisions which consisted mostly of inexperienced youth, moved on Sangju. It was part of a concentrated attack by the KPA aiming to push the UN forces south before they had time to organize an effective defensive line. Simultaneously with their appearance on the Hamch'ang road at the southern base of the Mun'gyong plateau north of Sangju, the North Koreans approached on the secondary mountain road to the west. On July 22, F Company of the 35th Infantry was also attacked north of Hamch'ang, when it was confronted with a North Korean battalion three times its size. The company fought effectively and inflicted heavy casualties, though the next day rains caused flooding of a river to the unit's rear and cut off its route of supply. Assisted by artillery, it was able to disengage. = The 24th Infantry falters = Elements of the US 24th Infantry Regiment had a similar experience west of Sangju. On that day, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, and elements of the ROK 17th Regiment were advancing into the mountains northwest of the town. There, they came into contact with the KPA 48th Regiment, 15th Division, the leading element of the North Korean troops. With E Company leading, 2nd Battalion moved along the dirt road into a gorge with precipitous mountain walls. Suddenly, a North Korean light mortar and one or two automatic weapons fired on E Company. It stopped and the men dispersed along the sides of the road. Troops of the 24th Infantry move to the Pusan Perimeter battleground. Soon North Korean rifle fire came in on the dispersed men and E and F Companies immediately began withdrawing in a disorderly manner. Troops began shying from the front and retreating without orders, ignoring officers' commands to stay in position. Colonel Horton V. White, the regimental commander, heard of the difficulty and drove hurriedly to the scene. He found the battalion coming back down the road in disorder and most of the men in a state of panic. Historians blame the retreat as much on officers' ineptitude as individual soldiers panicking. He mustered the men and ordered a retreat but by then many soldiers were withdrawing on their own. The next day the ROK 17th Regiment enveloped the North Korean position that had launched the attack and captured two light machine guns, one mortar, and about 30 North Koreans who appeared to be guerrillas. The ROK 17th Regiment fought in the hills for the next two days, making some limited gains, and then it moved back to Sangju to join other units as part of the ROK reorganization in progress around Pusan. This left only the US 24th Infantry Regiment guarding the west approach to Sangju from the Mun'gyong plateau. The tendency to panic continued in nearly all the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju. Men left their positions and straggled to the rear. They abandoned weapons on positions. On many occasions units lost most of their equipment while on the move, even when not under fire, causing logistical shortages. In other cases the majority of a unit would desert its position at the first sign of North Korean fire. By July 26 all three battalions of the 24th Infantry were concentrated in remote battle positions that were difficult to resupply, astride the road west of Sangju. The shortage of UN troops forced the regiment to devote most of its troops to the front, leaving very few reserves to respond to attacks. Elements of the KPA 15th Division advancing on this road had cleared the mountain passes and were closing with the regiment. From July 26 to the end of the month the North Koreans had almost constant contact with the 24th Infantry, which was supported by the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion. The North Koreans relied heavily on massed charges to close rapidly on the US lines. This caused heavy casualties for the North Koreans, but their mortars and artillery inflicted significant casualties on the American lines in turn. During the last days of July, the 24th Infantry generally tried to hold positions during the day, and then withdrew at night. Their performance was mixed; during the first few North Korean attacks, most units held positions until they ran out of ammunition. Higher officers attempted to move the units back in position but were unsuccessful in the face of mounting North Korean resistance. Notably, L Company fought until surrounded by North Korean attackers; the rest of the regiment was able to drive them off. On July 29 the 1st Battalion suffered about 60 casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As the men were preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, for reasons that are still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans. = US withdrawal = In the final days of the fight, to the west of Sangju, Major John R. Woolridge, one of the regiment's senior officers, set up a check point west of the town and stopped every vehicle coming from the west, taking off stragglers attempting to retreat. Many jeeps were filled with six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun. He averaged about 75 stragglers a day, and 150 on the last day of the battle. A contingent of military police were dispatched specifically to collect men abandoning their positions and to return them to the front. By July 30, the 24th Infantry had withdrawn to the last defensible high ground west of Sangju, from the town. The KPA hit the regiment with heavy attacks beginning at 05:00 that morning, targeting the 3rd Battalion's forward positions. Overstretched, lacking reserves and plagued by stragglers, the regiment began to come apart and senior commanders had to personally move into the front lines to help resist the KPA advance with their sidearms. The regiment had deteriorated so badly by this time that General Kean recalled the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, and placed it in defensive positions behind the 24th Infantry, to hold the line when the 24th withdrew. The next day the KPA again pressed against the regiment's forward line of resistance. First Lieutenant Leon A. Gilbert, commanding A Company, and about 15 men then quit the forward line. White and other ranking officers ordered Gilbert back into position, but he refused to go, saying that he was scared. The senior noncommissioned officer returned to the forward position with the men. After regimental commanders pleaded unsuccessfully with Gilbert to return to his position, he was arrested and tried for desertion under fire, a capital offense, and sentenced to death. His sentence was later reduced to 17 years in prison, but he served only five of them. Finally, during the night of July 31 the 24th Infantry Regiment withdrew through Sangju. The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, covered the withdrawal. The KPA 15th Division set up a new defensive line at Sangju the next day as the 25th Infantry Division was moved to deal with a growing attack on Masan to the south.  Aftermath  A soldier of the 24th Infantry rests during a lull in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. In 11 days of action in the Sangju area the 24th Regiment had suffered 323 battle casualties, 27 killed, 293 wounded, and 3 missing. The light casualty count was partially credited to effective use of fortifications and North Korean caution in advancing during the fight, but the fact that 24th Infantry troops were quick to withdraw was also blamed. The regiment, a mostly black unit left over from the US military's recently abolished segregated system, was blasted for its poor performance during the fight. Walker, seeing the 24th Infantry as an ineffective unit, resolved to use it only as a \\"trip wire force\\" on the front lines, requiring it to be reinforced by another regiment in reserve to conduct serious resistance when the 24th broke. Other leaders saw the poor performance as a reason to demand further integration of the armed forces, which had not been easy to do before the war. The 24th Infantry was fully desegregated on October 1, 1951. In reaching the upper Naktong valley at the end of July, the North Korean divisions engaged in this part of the drive southward had suffered heavy casualties. The KPA 1st Division in battling across the Mun'gyong plateau against the ROK 6th Division not only suffered great losses in the ground battle but also took serious losses from UN aerial attack. Prisoners reported that by the time it reached Hamch'ang at the end of July it was down to 3,000 men from the 5,500 it had before the push. The KPA 15th Division, according to prisoners, also lost heavily to artillery and mortar fire in its drive on Sangju against ROK troops and the US 24th Infantry Regiment, and was down to about 5,000 men at the end of July, from 7,500 before the fight. In contrast, the KPA 13th Division had bypassed Hamch'ang on the west and, save for minor skirmishes with ROK troops and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties. In the years since the war, the battle has been investigated as an example of the prevalence of racism in the US Army during the Korean War. The 24th Infantry, though officially desegregated, was still made up overwhelmingly of African-American soldiers. Historians contend its accomplishments, particularly at Yechon, were ignored while shortcomings were seized upon to depict the 24th as a sub-par unit and African-Americans as inferior soldiers to whites. Historians have also pointed out that although the performance of the 24th Infantry was indeed poor, these failings were exaggerated due to racism. Black Soldier, White Army, a 1988 book by William T. Bowers, William M. Hammond and George L. MacGarrigle, concluded that a combination of an overextended line and inexperienced white officers who were not firm or effective in asserting their authority were the primary factors in the performance of the 24th. Others contend that the untested regiment performed similarly to units of the 24th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division in their first engagements. With training, many of the same troops became effective fighters in a matter of weeks. Lieutenant Colonel Charles M. Bussey, a member of the 24th Infantry that participated in the battle, claimed in his memoir Firefight at Yechon: Courage and Racism in the Korean War that the 24th Infantry's good performances, particularly at Yechon, were ignored, and soldiers denied medals for their actions because of racism.

The site has an extant burial mound, and may have possibly had two others in the past. The site is believed to have been occupied from 50 to 200 CE. Copper objects, Marksville culture ceramics and a stone platform pipe were found in excavations at the site. The site is believed to be the only site in the Natchez Bluffs region to have been actively involved in the Hopewell Interaction Sphere. It is one of four mounds in the area believed to date to the Early Marksville period, the other three being the Marskville Mound 4 and Crooks Mounds A and B, all located in nearby Louisiana. The mound itself was built in several stages over many years, very similar to the Crooks Mound A in La Salle Parish, Louisiana. Unlike some other Hopewell sites, such as the Tremper Mound in Scioto County, Ohio, the site showed no evidence of a mortuary or communal structure previous to the construction of the mound. The beginning stage is believed to have been a rectangular earthen platform in height, wide on its east‚Äìwest axis and long on its north‚Äìsouth axis. After a period of use, this platform was covered with a mantle of earth in height and wide along its east‚Äìwest axis, with an extremely hard cap of earth covering the mound.

Based on the central system's parallax of 9.03 mas, it is located about 360 light-years (110 parsecs) away. The other stars in the system are slightly farther away. System The central pair is known as Rho Ophiuchi AB. It consists of at least two blue-colored subgiants or main-sequence stars, designated Rho Ophiuchi A and B, respectively. Rho Ophiuchi AB is a visual binary, and the sky-projected distance between the two stars appears to be 3.1‚Ä≥, corresponding to a separation of at least 344 astronomical units (au). However, the actual separation is larger, and the two take about 2,400 years to complete an orbit. Several other stars are located close to Rho Ophiuchi AB.

It is one of the easiest star forming regions to observe, as it is one of the nearest, and it is visible from both hemispheres. The interstellar extinction (AV) of Rho Ophiuchi is measured to be 1.45 magnitudes, meaning the dust and gas in front of Rho Ophiuchi absorbs light from the system, making it appear 1.45 magnitudes dimmer than it should be. Additionally, gas and dust also scatters more higher-frequency light, leaving the light appearing more reddish. The interstellar reddening (EB‚àíV) of Rho Ophiuchi has been measured to be 0.47 magnitudes.

Randolph had no formal engineering training, he began his career as a railroad axeman. After completing the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, at the time the largest canal in the world, Randolph became a consulting engineer on the Panama Canal at the request of the Roosevelt Administration.  Early life in Virginia (1848‚Äì1870)  Isham Randolph is a descendant of the prominent Randolph family of Virginia. He was 13 years old when the American Civil War began, and lost two brothers who fought for the Confederate States of America. Randolph's family owned slaves, and Randolph learned the beginnings of his engineering skills from a slave his family owned. In 1868, Randolph became an axeman working on the Winchester and Strasburg Railroad, part of the Winchester and Potomac Railroad operated at the time by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Following his service with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, he was the Assistant Engineer for the Scioto Valley Railroad. Randolph Street in Ashville, Ohio is named in his honor.  Railroad work in Chicago (1870‚Äì1893)  Randolph arrived in Chicago in 1870, working as a surveyor for the Chicago Division of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In 1880 Randolph became the chief engineer of the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad. In 1880, Randolph presented himself to Carter Harrison, Sr. the Mayor of Chicago, and his 3rd cousin. The mayor opposed the expansion of the line Randolph was working on, and encouraged mob action against Randolph and his men.  Chief Engineer, Sanitary District of Chicago (1893‚Äì1907)  Randolph was appointed the Chief Engineer of the Sanitary District of Chicago on June 7, 1893, and left that position in 1907. His most significant contribution to the district was the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal which reversed the flow of the Chicago River and created a large vessel waterway between Lake Michigan and the Gulf of Mexico. Randolph was the fourth Chief Engineer of the district, the previous three were not able to conceive of a plan for the canal that would meet the requirements of the city for a budget that the city was satisfied with. The last statement is not correct, although it may be attributed to the cited reference. The basic plan for the canal was in the 1887 report of the Commission on Drainage and Water Supply appointed by the Chicago City Council. The report was prepared by Rudolph Hering assisted by Benezette Williams and Samuel Artingstall. Williams and Artingstall were the second and third chief engineers of the Sanitary District of Chicago, preceding Randolph. The initial contracts for construction of the canal were awarded and construction began before Randolph was appointed. Randolph's genius in the construction of the canal and later projects of the district was his strict adherence to the plan and contract requirements. He deftly guided the elected board members of the district in making sound engineering decisions. He also supervised others in the design of regulating structures, controlling gates and a navigation lock that were pioneering for the time.

In March 1920 John Lawson was lost at sea when a small fishing boat capsized. This led to the decision to automate the operation of the lighthouse, and it was demanned in 1920.There is some confusion about the year. states \\"The last keeper left in 1920 and the light was automated in 1930.\\" However, at a table above that, it is stated \\"Automated: 1920\\". An explanation made by makes sense only if the light was automated in 1920, leaving some presence, and totally demanned in 1930. The light was converted to an automatic acetylene gas burner (carbide lamp). During the 1980s the lighthouse was deactivated and replaced with a small fiberglass beacon. The beacon has NGA number 111-10030 and Admiralty number K3117. It is still active, displaying a characteristic of two white flashes, every eight seconds (Fl.(2)W. 8s).List of Lights In 1992 the lighthouse was relocated to the Townsville Maritime Museum.

It is presumed to have been written by the Elizabethan playwright, Thomas Kyd (1558‚Äì1594). Genre Before the existence of large daily newspapers since the late 18th century, news of the day, including sensationalist pieces, of which this is one example, were communicated by such pamphlets or else by ballads. Though written by a playwright, it does not seem to have been produced as a play in Elizabethan times. Nevertheless, it shows some affinity with domestic tragedies of the period, all on the subject of woman's adulterous proclivities, such as A Yorkshire Tragedy, Arden of Faversham, and A Woman Killed with Kindness. William Shakespeare's Othello, to a lesser extent The Winter's Tale and The Merry Wives of Windsor, are additional examples of this category, except that in each case the woman's adultery is falsely imagined by the husband. Domestic tragedies include the murder of other family members, such as the lost Jacobean play Keep the Widow Waking, in which a son kills his mother.

Due to the start of World War II, the British naval authorities in Cochin demanded that the ship be handed over to them for defence purposes.

It was designed by Doug Niles, Carl Sargent, and Rik Rose, and published by TSR in 1989. It describes the Free City of Greyhawk (the major city of the campaign setting) in detail, and was highly praised by Dragon magazine. Contents The boxed set describes the major city of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting in detail. The Free City of Greyhawk, Gem of the Flanaess, is the adventuring town that gives the World of Greyhawk setting its name. The set includes a detailed fold-out bird's-eye-view of the town, which matches the diagrammatic, keyed-location street map. The map is cross-referenced with one of the booklets to describe the major features of the city. Also included are large maps of the sewers and underground passages, and a map of the surrounding region. The set describes a wide variety of NPCs, their fellowships and conspiracies, and their associated game mechanics, personalities, tactics, and loose narrative threads. Potential allies, patrons, informants, and enemies are available for any group of characters. External politics are intertwined in the city's internal affairs, and rival guilds compete for power and influence, while dark conspiracies are plotted beneath the streets. One of the booklets includes four adventure scenarios that develop themes and elements already presented in the city background. Twenty-three short adventures are printed on the front and back of a single piece of card stock, and the 24th sheet of card stock summarizes the monster stats for these short adventures. Each adventure develops at least some element of plot, character, or theme presented in the city background material. Some are dungeon crawls, some wilderness expeditions, some city adventures, and some diplomatic intrigues. Publication history The City of Greyhawk was designed by Doug Niles, Carl Sargent, and Rik Rose. It was published by TSR in 1989 as a boxed set which included two 96-page paperback books, four full-color 22‚Äù √ó 34‚Äù maps, and 24 one-page adventures on card stock. Reception Lisa Stevens reviewed The City of Greyhawk for White Wolf #20, rating it 4 out of 5 overall, and stated that \\"Overall, this product is the most exciting supplement to come out of the TSR stables since the original Player's Handbook took that first giant leap into role-playing. The quality of the writing and production gives the buyer more than his money's worth. The prose is interesting to read and stimulates the creative juices that so many other products leave stagnant.\\" Ken Rolston reviewed The City of Greyhawk for Dragon magazine #156 (April 1990). He reviewed multiple city supplements in the same review, but said that this was \\"the most pleasing and playable\\" of them, and \\"it has that comfortable, played-in feeling that warms the heart of the experienced AD&D; game DM\\". The maps \\"combine the virtues of easy reference, graphic detail, sense of place, and pleasing appearance better than any other city supplement I've seen\\". The four scenarios included in one of the booklets are \\"simple, complete, appropriate, and admirable examples of city FRPG adventuring\\", but the \\"real treasures\\" are the 23 short adventures printed on the card stock. He described the short adventures as \\"priceless, many touched with humor and irony, with interesting plot twists; they challenge role-playing and problem-solving. All are eminently practical and playable, and presented with rare charm and simplicity.\\" Noting the inclusion of the Circle of Eight as an example, Rolston commented: \\"One of the best things about The City of Greyhawk is that it ably exploits all the venerable virtues of the AD&D; game. This is the campaign pack that TSR should have produced a decade ago, back when AD&D; games were young and fresh. Now it is perhaps a certain nostalgia I indulge in my enjoyment of The City of Greyhawk; this is a package out of the golden age of the AD&D; game\\". Rolston concluded that \\"The City of Greyhawk is a very good urban FRPG pack, but more than that, it's really a complete campaign setting for the AD&D; game, the best I've seen‚Äîcoherent, playable, well-developed, and entertaining.\\" Game designer Rick Swan considered the Greyhawk setting \\"a mess\\", but called The City of Greyhawk \\"the most credible attempt at smoothing out the rough spots\\": \\"Wisely concentrating on a small section of the world, the set offered a host of intriguing personalities, adventure ideas galore, and best of all, a coherent background.\\" References Category:Greyhawk books ","title":"The City of Greyhawk"},{"id":"29611612","text":"Hendrik Carr√© (October 2, 1656, Amsterdam - July 7, 1721, The Hague), was a Dutch Golden Age painter.

During his time in office the Mayor initiated an aggressive program of municipal improvements in streets, parks, greenery, revenue collection, environmental control, and solid waste management. He was assisted in his municipal reform efforts by the USAID's ‚ÄúKabul City Initiative‚Äù project, the World Bank, Japanese Government JICA and other International Donors to build municipal capacity, improve service delivery and infrastructure, and increase municipal revenue for a cleaner and greener Kabul. Nawandish also serves as a member of the Kabul Polytechnic University‚Äôs Academic Council and of Kabul University. He is a member of two non ‚Äì governmental organizations: the Afghanistan Engineers and Architects Association and Afghan American Engineers Union. Nawandish is also current president of Society of Afghan Architects and Engineers (SAAE). Nawandish was reluctant to be the mayor of Kabul at first due to its difficulty. His day begins at five in the morning and usually ends at about one the following morning. He is a compulsive walker, sometimes covering as much as 10 km (six miles) a day. The mayor is known to be a night bird. He often inspects Kabul's streets at night when residents of the city are fast asleep. Mr Nawandish has succeeded in generating millions of dollars more revenue for Kabul during his tenure - mainly from retail taxes, business taxes, advertisements and property and business taxes. He also has regular visits to Washington, Moscow and Istanbul. One of the mayor's top objectives now is his ongoing campaign to remove illegal shops, buildings and illegally parked carts from the city's streets and pavements. Early years Muhammad Yunus Nawandish has thirty years of experience in the oil, gas and power sectors in Afghanistan. He served as Manager of the Afghan Gas Refinery Department, Ministry of Mines and Industry (MMI) from 1979 ‚Äì 1981; as Adviser in Ministry of foreign affairs from 1984 ‚Äì 1988; as Petroleum Engineer (MMI) from 1989 ‚Äì 1992; and as Professor of Engineering at Balkh University in northern Afghanistan from 1992 ‚Äì 1994. During the Taliban regime (1998 ‚Äì 2001) the Mayor lived outside Afghanistan. From 2001 to 2005 he served as Deputy Minister of Water and Energy. Since 2005 he managed new construction and rehabilitation projects in the generation, transmission and distribution of energy in a conflict environment. He designed the largest power sector project in Afghanistan, the Northern Transmission System which provides power to Afghanistan from Uzbekistan. On behalf of the Afghan Government, he has coordinated over $500 million in power sector projects in cooperation with the Asian Development Bank, USAID, the European Union, The World Bank, and the Governments of India, Iran, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and South Korea. He has worked as a senior advisor on the U.S. Agency for International Development funded project to rehabilitate the Sheberghan gas fields. Personal life and education Muhammad Yunus Nawandish holds a B.S in Petroleum Engineering from Polytechnical University of Kabul and a M.S in Gas Production and Distribution Specialty from Ukraine. He is married and has 6 children. Achievements and awards The Mayor of Kabul was invited to the United States Conference of Mayors (USCM) as a special guest in 2011. He is the first public participation gold medalist in Afghanistan that was awarded by the Citizens in Kabul. The Christian Science Monitor hailed Mayor Nawandish as \\"The can-do mayor of Kabul: Some see a model for a modern Afghanistan politician\\". He has also been dubbed as the \\"Builder of Kabul\\". In 2012 Muhammad Yunus Nawandish was selected for 16 best mayors of the world by Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva Switzerland, and he has been chosen for top 5 mayors among all 16 mayors of the other countries. =Mayoral higlights= Gets foreign donors to pay for everything from solar-powered streetlights and public toilets to bus networks and overpasses.

He lived in Las Vegas from 1997 to 2017. Education O'Brien, who grew up in the Atlanta, Georgia, area, graduated in 1988 from Decatur High School, where he was a point guard on the basketball team, and from the University of West Georgia in 1995. He taught English at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, from where he earned a MFA in creative writing.\\"Faculty & Staff\\". unlv.edu.  Career  He was a staff writer, news editor and managing editor of the alternative weekly Las Vegas CityLife from 2000 to 2008. While at the paper, he co-wrote two cover stories about exploring the underground flood channels of Las Vegas after reading about Timmy \\"TJ\\" Weber, who was suspected (and later convicted) of murdering his girlfriend and her son, raping her daughter and attempting to kill another son. Weber used the drains to evade the police. O'Brien discovered hundreds of homeless people living in the storm drains. His research about and interviews from inside the underground flood channels are detailed in his book Beneath the Neon: Life and Death in the Tunnels of Las Vegas, released in June 2007. This book has been reviewed or written about by more than 100 media outlets, including Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, Wired, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Nightline, \\"The CBS Evening News with Katie Couric\\", Al Jazeera, CNN, NPR, the BBC, the Associated Press, and other national and international media outlets have done stories about the tunnels and the tunnel-dwellers. CNN's Michael Cary went into the tunnels with O'Brien and described him as \\"an expert on the more than 300 miles of underground flood channels and its tunnel dwellers.\\" O'Brien's second book, My Week at the Blue Angel: And Other Stories from the Storm Drains, Strip Clubs, and Trailer Parks of Las Vegas, released November 15, 2010, is a collection of creative-nonfiction stories set in off-the-beaten- path Vegas, including a seedy motel on East Fremont Street that's known for prostitution, street drug dealing and violence, and the case of Jessie Foster, an international endangered missing Canadian woman lured to Las Vegas who disappeared 10 months later. Jessie is thought to be the victim of human trafficking. O'Brien is founder of Shine a Light, a community project that provides housing, drug counseling, and other services to homeless people living in the drains. In a January 2011 article, the Atlanta Journal- Constitution described O'Brien's work in the tunnels \\"turned into a 4¬Ω-year obsession for O'Brien, where he wound up documenting a population he suspects no one except a handful of police officers knew existed.\\" CBS News correspondent Seth Doane, who went underneath the Las Vegas Strip with O'Brien in the summer of 2010, wrote that \\"O'Brien's interest has turned into advocacy\\" in his efforts to help the homeless. American Public Media's \\"The Story\\" segment covered O'Brien's efforts to help homeless people when they interviewed O'Brien and featured a homeless man in April 2011. On September 3‚Äì4, 2013, O'Brien appeared on the Dr. Phil Show in a two-part series after O'Brien escorted professional locator Troy Dunn into the underground flood channels of Las Vegas. There, they found a homeless mother, Cyndi, who'd been separated from her four daughters for several years.\\"Dr. Phil.com - Shows - Below Rock Bottom\\". drphil.com. The second episode of the show, Cyndi appeared with Dr. Phil and reunited with her daughters in the studio. At the end of the show, Dr. Phil offered Cyndi and her husband, Rick, rehab and family- counseling services, which they accepted. Dr. Phil discussed O'Brien's book, Beneath the Neon.\\"Dr. Phil.com - Shows - Leaving Life in the Tunnels\\". drphil.com. In March 2015, digital network Seeker profiled O'Brien on the air as he explored the tunnels and interacted with residents. In January 2016, O'Brien raised more than $13,000 in 24 hours through Crowdrise for O'Brien's nonprofit group Shine a Light to benefit homeless people living in tunnels beneath the Las Vegas Strip. After three tunnel dwellers died in June 2016 in a flash flood, O'Brien and a homeless man called \\"Jazz\\" appeared on NPR's southern Nevada affiliate KNPR to talk about the flood, in which Jazz's longtime girlfriend Sharon drowned. O'Brien's nonprofit, Shine a Light, helped one of the flood victim's families with expenses surrounding the death. In July 2017, O'Brien relocated to San Salvador in Central America to teach literature at an English-language preparatory school and to write a sequel to Beneath the Neon about survivor dwellers of the storm drains. In an article about O'Brien, the Las Vegas Review Journal described his move out of the country as the \\"man who shined light on Las Vegas' tunnel dwellers (is) moving on.\\"  Awards  O'Brien received two Artists Fellowship grants awarded by the Nevada Arts Council for 2010 and 2007 for his nonfiction book projects. He has won several first-place awards in the Nevada Press Association's Better Newspaper Contest, including Journalist of Merit (given to journalists with less than five years of experience to encourage them to stay in the business) in 2002 and Outstanding Journalist (a top individual award) in 2006. In November 2011, O'Brien was given the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame Silver Pen Award, sponsored by the Friends of the University of Nevada, Reno Libraries. Established in 1996, the Silver Pen recognizes writers who are in mid-career but have already shown substantial achievement. After the announcement of the award, The Nevada Review featured O'Brien in a Q&A; article.

R. (Philip Russell; \\"Phil\\") Wallace (April 19, 1915 ‚Äì March 20, 2006) was a Canadian theoretical physicist and long-time professor at McGill University. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences (India). He had a distinguished career as educator, researcher, and activist in science and society, but he is increasingly well known for his pioneering paper in 1947 on the band structure of graphite, and particularly graphene, the subject of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. Early and wartime years Born in Toronto in 1915, Wallace entered the University of Toronto in 1933, achieving a B.A. in mathematics in 1937, an M.A. in 1938, and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1940 under Leopold Infeld with a thesis on electromagnetism in general relativity. Advised by L. J. Synge, then head of the Applied Mathematics Department at Toronto, to hold himself ready for war work in Canada, Wallace took a two-year job at the University of Cincinnati and then moved to a lectureship at MIT. In 1943 he was recruited to join the British-Canadian Atomic Energy Project at the National Research Council of Canada's Montreal Laboratory. From 1943 to 1946 Wallace worked as one of an impressive group of theorists and mathematicians led by George Placzek on nuclear reactor fundamentals, including study of the effects on graphite and other materials of intense neutron and ion bombardment. His assignment to visit N. F. Mott in Bristol, England for several months to learn what was known about graphite led Wallace to a lifelong interest in graphite and a career in condensed matter physics, not least his 1947 paper on the band structure of graphite. Academic and professional career =From mathematics to physics= When the Montreal effort moved to the Chalk River site in 1946, Wallace joined the Mathematics Department at McGill University and began to build a group of young theoretical physicists there. The anomaly, at least in North America, of theoretical physicists in the Math department, not in Physics, had historic roots at McGill, dating from Ernest Rutherford's time. More generally, Canadian universities followed the British model of separation of mathematics from physics, perhaps deigning to have a small separate department of applied mathematics. Rutherford's strongly expressed views solidified things at McGill for 50 years. But by the early 1960s circumstances had changed; Wallace and his group moved into the Physics Department. He has documented the post-war story of the growth of a tiny number of isolated theoretical physicists in Canada, basically \\"outsiders,\\" into a viable community of \\"insiders,\\" not only at McGill. =Research= Initially working in nuclear physics and properties of graphite, in the mid-1950s Wallace turned his attention to the newly discovered positron annihilation in solids and liquids. In 1960 he published what became a standard reference in the field. His later research focused on semiconductors and semimetals, particularly their behaviour under intense magnetic fields, with regular returns to properties of graphite. In addition to summer school proceedings, in 1969 he edited two volumes on superconductivity and in 1973 he co-edited a volume on new developments in semiconductors. =Teaching and mentoring= Wallace was a superb lecturer and mentor of students. His undergraduate course in methods of mathematical physics was inspirational. It allowed many students to see what a disciplined and well-trained mind could accomplish by applying mathematics to physical problems. More than a few careers were encouraged on their paths by Wallace's course. A text based on his notes was finally published in 1973. Over his career at McGill Wallace supervised over 30 graduate students to M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees, more than one third of them Ph.D.s. =Professional activities= Wallace was active in professional affairs, a co-founder of the Canadian Association of Physicists and founder and first chair of its Theoretical Physics Division, 1957‚Äì58. He served as Editor of the Canadian Journal of Physics, 1973‚Äì80, and on numerous advisory and planning committees for conferences. At McGill he was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics, 1966‚Äì70, and active in faculty and university affairs. Retirement Retiring as Professor Emeritus in Physics in 1982, Wallace soon became Principal of the Science College, Concordia University in Montreal, 1984‚Äì1987. In the 1990s he began writing semi-popular books explaining physics to the layperson, \\"Physics: Imagination and Reality\\" and \\"Paradox Lost: Images of the Quantum\\". He died on March 20, 2006 in Victoria, British Columbia of complications of old age. Obituaries appear in Physics in Canada and Physics Today.

Motorola, 105 F.3d 841 (2d Cir. 1997) is a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case in which the National Basketball Association (NBA) purported that Motorola and STATS infringed the NBA's copyright on the broadcast of games and misappropriated the data presented on the SportsTrax pager. Background Motorola manufactured and marketed the SportsTrax paging device which uses game information supplied by Sports Team Analysis and Tracking Systems (\\"STATS\\"). It offers four modes of operation: \\"current,\\" \\"statistics,\\" \\"final scores,\\" and \\"demonstration.\\" STATS compiled its scores and statistics by employing people to listen or watch the games, then enter the scores on the computer which transmits the scores to STATS' on-line service, to be sent out to anyone using a SportsTrax pager.\\"Sports Service Battles N.B.A In Round Two - NYTimes.com\\". The New York Times. 21 October 1996. Retrieved on 2010-9-28.

Retrieved on 2010-9-27. The NBA claimed that Motorola infringed on the NBA through information misappropriation of the basketball (and baseball) games by arguing that the factual data about the game represents the overall value of the game. The second circuit court of appeals addressed whether the 1976 copyright act preempted the state-law misappropriation claim.\\"Whats the law around aggregating news online?\\". Retrieved on 2010-9-28 The NBA asserted 6 claims: # unfair competition by misappropriation, # false advertising under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, (a), # false representation of origin under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, # state and common law unfair competition by false advertising and false designation of origin, # federal copyright infringement and # unlawful interception of communications under the Communications Act of 1934, . New York State Law Misappropriation Claim Due to the case involving the International News Service (INS) and the Associated Press (AP) in 1918, New York created a misappropriation law. International News Service v. Associated Press was one of the early cases addressing the issue raised by technological advances, where the International News Service directly lifted factual stories from AP bulletins and wired them to newspapers.\\"NBA v. Motorola and STATS\\". Retrieved on 2010-9-27 Opinion of the Court The district court dismissed all of the NBA's claims except the first - misappropriation under New York Law. The court also dismissed the counterclaim by Motorola that the NBA unlawfully interfered with Motorola's contractual sponsorship by four individual NBA teams. The Second Circuit appellate court struck down the NBA's assertion that the games are copyrighted. \\"Sports events are not 'authored' in any common sense of the word\\"(21), arguing that if copyright was open to sporting events, \\"the inventor of the T-formation in football\\" would be able to control all uses of the T-formation and could cause problems with the prosperity of the sport. =Preemption under the Copyright Act= The district court's injunction was based on its conclusions that the defendants had unlawfully misappropriated the NBA's property rights in its games, under New York law. However, the Second Circuit found that \\"the district court concluded that the NBA's misappropriation claim was not preempted because... the subject matter requirement was not met\\"(39). The Second Circuit court argued that the copyright act should not be used to distinguish between copyright infringement and state-law misappropriation. =Infringement of a Copyright in the broadcasts of NBA games= The Court noted that the broadcasts of the NBA games, not the games themselves, are entitled to copyright protection. The Copyright Act of 1909 was amended in 1976 specifically to protect the broadcast and meet the requirement that the original work of authorship be \\"fixed in any tangible medium of expression\\" (a). The district court held that Motorola and STATS did not infringe NBA's copyright because only facts from the broadcasts, not the broadcasts themselves were transmitted. The Second Circuit Court agreed with the district court's argument that the \\"[d]efendants provide purely factual information which any patron of an NBA game could acquire from the arena without any involvement from the director, cameramen, or others who contribute to the originality of the broadcast\\" [939 F. Supp. at 1094]. =State-Law Misappropriation Claim= The New York hot news misappropriation developed out of International News Service v. Associated Press, a 1918 U.S. Supreme Court case. Great Britain prohibited INS reporters because INS's owner, William Randolph Hearst, was an outspoken critic of the allies and an open supporter of the Germans. In order to keep INS newspapers up to date with the latest information from the war, the INS would obtain the factual data from east coast AP news articles, then would send it out to subscribers on the west coast, occasionally beating the AP news stories. In order to deal with this, the Supreme court \\"crafted a new variant of the common law tort of misappropriation\\" called the \\"hot news\\" doctrine. New York sought to apply ethical standards to the INS case and created its own body of misappropriation law. However, the Second Circuit Court found that the New York misappropriation law \\"goes well beyond the 'hot news' claims and is preempted\\". The court claimed that to survive a \\"hot news\\" INS-like claim, several elements were required: the plaintiff generates the information at a cost; the information is time-sensitive; the defendant is free riding off the plaintiff's efforts; and the defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs, and in doing so, enables others to free ride off the efforts of the plaintiffs. Reaction The Second Circuit Court dismissed the misappropriation claim and affirmed the district court's dismissal of NBA's claim of false advertising under the Lanham Act.

Born in Newport in Monmouthshire, Llewellyn became the Welsh heavyweight champion in 1922. A police officer by profession, he often fought under the name PC Trevor Llewellyn. Personal history Llewellyn was born in Newport to George and Alice Maud. He married Rhoda Welsher and they had two daughters. He joined the police force and worked at Newport Docks. Boxing career Little is recorded of Llewellyn's amateur career, though a professional fight, against fellow Welshman Gipsy Daniels is recorded on 1 April 1922. The fight took place at Stow Hill Drill Hall in Newport, with the bout being given to Daniels on points decision after the contest went the distance of fifteen rounds. Two months later Llewellyn fought again in Newport, knocking out Jack Tyrell of Cardiff in the sixth. He then faced and beat Bob Allison on 3 July. On 19 August 1922, Llewellyn met Tom Norris of Clydach Vale for the Welsh heavyweight championship. Contested at the Empire Music Hall in Newport, the fight was scheduled for twenty rounds, but Llewellyn managed to stop Norris through a technical knockout in the third, becoming the Welsh champion. After losing by points to Guardsman Charlie Penewill at the start of October 1922, Llewellyn faced Australian heavyweight champion Albert 'Kid' Lloyd. The Lloyd fight gives one of the best recordings of Llewellyn's fighting style with a report in The Mercury on 1 November. The article describes how Llewellyn was known as the \\"White Hope\\" to Welsh boxing fans, though Lloyd is said to have led with the better strategy, by attacking aggressively in the opening rounds. The reporter mentions that Llewellyn had a dangerous left, though in the Lloyd fight his early punishment exhausted him from employing it. Llewellyn retired from the fight in the thirteenth. Llewellyn's record after becoming Welshheavyweight champion is poor, with only one win recorded up to 1925. He faced Tom Norris again in 1924, but lost on points. In 1925 he is recorded as losing three fights; Charlie Smith in Cardiff, Northern Area heavyweight champion Con O'Kelly in Hull and future Welsh heavyweight champion Dick Power.

Dedication A dedication was held May 13, 2010, to celebrate the facility's new home at the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana. Joseph Medicine Crow wore his Presidential Medal of Freedom as he tapped the building with a coup stick; a common practice that warriors used when a new lodge or teepee was raised.

The Payne Family Native American Center is the most recent facility to be built at the university and occupies the last of its usable building space around the oval. The center was designed by Daniel Glenn, a member of the Crow Tribe and principal of Glenn & Glenn Architects Engineers, PLLC. The center holds four classrooms, one conference room, 12 office spaces, a student lounge and student meeting rooms. Keeping with Native American tradition, the center's main entrance faces east. The roof features a long skylight, which resembles the slit of a teepee's smoke hole. Carved into exterior walls are the seals of Montana's seven reservations and the landless Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana, as well as quotes from former University President George Dennison and Native American elders such as Earl Barlow and Joseph Medicine Crow. Seven native plant and herb gardens circle the center and symbolize the state's reservations and the seven stars of the big dipper. Sustainability According to project superintendent Todd Stenerson, 85 percent of the construction waste was diverted from the landfill. University project manager Jameel Chaudhry said rocks were dug up from the building site and used for retaining walls in place of concrete. Contractors were encouraged to purchase materials locally to reduce the carbon footprint. Bathrooms in the center include showers that could encourage biking and walking to campus. The center is the first building in the Montana University System to be certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System. Financing The Native American Center was financed largely by Terry Payne who graduated from the University of Montana in 1963. He is the chairman of the Payne Financial Group, in Missoula, Montana. The center cost $8.6 million to build. Other key donors include First Interstate Bank and the Indian Land Tenure Foundation. Awards On November 5, 2010, The Payne Family Native American Center was awarded the Environmental Achievement award by the Pacific Northwest International Section of the Air and Waste Management Association during the association's 50th annual conference. Vandalism On April 13, 2010, a rock was thrown into the window of a door on the northeast side of the building. The rock broke the outside glass pane, but did not go all the way through the window. The incident was reported to campus police around 10:58 a.m. the next day. President George Dennison sent out a campus wide email that appealed to the campus to report \\"any activities that appear to threaten the grounds, facilities, and campus members.\\" References External links * UM Native American Center Category:Buildings and facilities of the University of Montana Category:Tribal Colleges in Montana Category:2010 establishments in Montana Category:University and college buildings completed in 2010 ","title":"The Payne Family Native American Center"},{"id":"29612134","text":"Ferry Radax in 2014 Ferry Radax (born June 20, 1932) is an Austrian film maker born in Vienna.

The name \\"Bagyi\\" is his phonetic spelling of the word \\"pangyi\\", meaning \\"painting\\", which he first added to his name in 1955. Santiniketan and Early Life in Burma The Indian government offered him a scholarship in 1951 to study art at Santiniketan, founded by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, but he chose to return to Burma after only a year. He traveled throughout Burma studying its handicrafts, classical art and architecture, especially that of Bagan. In early 1953 one of Aung Soe's abstract paintings was published in Shumawa magazine, causing considerable controversy. Some said that the artist was mad. Trip to Peshawar, Afghanistan and Russia In the winter of 1953 he was able to visit Peshawar, Afghanistan and Moscow for art studies. It has been alleged that in Russia he saw the works of modern European masters such as Picasso, Matisse and Kandinsky, but this can hardly be true because the work of the European modern masters was in deep storage in Russia and unavailable to public view during the Stainist period and for many years afterwards. However, it is clear that Aung Soe was influenced by European painters such as Picasso and Matisse, probably Japanese painting (one work shows influence of sumi-e), and the work of painters at Santiniketan, both contemporary and deceased, whose works were in the Santiniketan Museum. During his time at Santiniketan, Aung Soe met the Indonesian expressionist painter Affandi, who also influenced him. In addition to these foreign influences, Aung Soe was deeply influenced by the long history of Burmese Traditional painting, stretching back to the time of Bagan, which can still be seen on the walls of temples of the old city there. Later life in Burma After this, he had to depend on the Rangoon University library for art books as a source of inspiration. An eccentric, at times drunken and emotional, he had few friends in the artistic community, and few who shared his views on art. He worked alone, but did show his work in informal underground exhibitions, introducing concepts such as Cubism and Surrealism. To earn money, Bagyi Aung Soe painted for magazines and book covers until the end of his career. At times his family was so poor that his wife had to sell mohinga, a noodle soup, to support them. Bagyi Aung Soe suffered poverty and isolation and never found success during his life. He died in 1990, going deaf and blind. Work Titled \\"Self Portrait\\" by Aung Soe Aung Soe thought deeply about the relevance of art in 20th-century Burma. According to Yin Ker, \\"He aspired for his paintings to be visual translations of Buddhist truths, not mere illustrations of episodes from the Buddha's previous lives or pretty pictures of pagodas and monks\\". In his later years, in poverty and with failing health, he became increasingly obsessed with creating an artistic idiom that reflected the Buddhist laws of impermanence. His biographer has said \\"he transposed his spiritual aspirations and experiences into his artistic mission statement and applied their practical methods to the act of creation\\". Though Aung Soe's talent was unrecognized during his life, he is now among the most admired and most famous of Burmese modern artists. Less than ten years after his death, his paintings fetched thousands of dollars in Indonesian art galleries. The organizer of a 2009 exhibition in his honor said \\"almost two decades after his death, his art continues to fascinate and stimulate\\".

The group consists of lead vocalist Jamon Scott, guitarist Brian Blush, bassist Dan Allen Crawley and drummer Chris Rickman. The Toluenes music spans various genres, with some songs containing a heavy country flavor while others have a raw modern rock edge. Their lyrics frequently center around stories set in the Southwest and contain numerous references to Mexico. History The Toluenes was formed in 2005 by Jamon Scott and Dan Allen Crawley. The two had met years earlier in the south-central Kentucky town of Albany, where they attended high school together.Orosz, Monica (June 4, 2009). \\"The Toluenes: Band a blast of original music: Both members of the duo write own music, lyrics\\", Charleston Daily Mail, p. D1. Both went on to become aspiring songwriters in Nashville for several years in the mid-to-late 1990s before deciding to form a band and record their own songs. The band was originally conceived as a duo with Scott and Crawley playing all the instruments in the studio and performing live shows with an ever-changing line-up of backing musicians which has included, among others, former Charlie Daniels Band drummer Gary Allen. Hola from The Toluenes Hola from The Toluenes is a 5-song e.p. released in limited quantities in 2005. The songs on Hola were twangy Americana at heart but with prominent electric guitars and a heavy Southwestern influence. Lyrically, the songs alternate from humorous stories of self-inflicted mishap to woeful tales of loss and the anguish that drives one to take such ill-advised risks. Four Chords & A Pack of Lies Four Chords & A Pack of Lies was released in 2007 and was the first full-length album from The Toluenes. The title of the disc is a reference to the Harlan Howard quote that ‚Äúcountry music is three chords and the truth‚Äù. The set includes the five songs from their previous effort, along with five more songs that further expand upon the story only hinted at on that first outing. A concept album of sorts, Four Chords & A Pack of Lies tells the story of heartbreak and the journey that results from trying to run away from a pain that cannot be eluded. Two songs, Adios New Mexico and Mexico, received airplay on internet and college radio. Off The Wagon & On The Lam Released in the winter of 2008, Off The Wagon and On The Lam is the second full-length release from The Toluenes. The 10 songs pick up right where Four Chords left off with more tales of love and alcohol. Musically, the band is more adventuresome this time out with a pair of dark alternative numbers and a couple of radio-ready country singles. The first single from OTWAOTL was El Diablo, while Drunk & Naked was the follow-up. Cervezas, Senoritas, Etc., Etc. While touring in support of Off The Wagon and On The Lam, Scott and Crawley began assembling songs for the follow-up. However, in August 2009, Crawley announced that he was leaving the band. Scott decided to continue on as The Toluenes and went into the studio to work on the next album with guitarist Dave Flint, who is best known for his work with Highway 101. The result was a more organic, country-flavored record entitled Cervezas, Senoritas, Etc., Etc. The title of the disc was a reference to Dwight Yoakam‚Äôs Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc. The lead-off single, Middle of Nowhere, was an acoustic songwriting demo that was added to the album at the last minute. It also became The Toluenes‚Äô first-ever music video. The second single, Bones, was also accompanied by a video. Quatro Hello In late 2010, Scott went back into the studio to record a handful of tracks for the follow-up to Cervezas, Senoritas, Etc., Etc. Working with guitarist Flint again, Jamon also enlisted the services of a number of outside musicians including Geoff Firebaugh (formerly of BR5-49) and Brian Blush (formerly of The Refreshments). During sessions for Her Way Or The Highway and Dead Horses, Scott and Blush discovered a musical chemistry that, ultimately, led to Blush being invited to join the band. At the same time, Scott had been talking with Crawley about a possible return to the fold, this time as a bassist. Drummer Chris Rickman, who had played with the group a few years earlier, also returned to the fold, making the band a foursome. Quatro Hello is, reportedly, a return to the harder-rocking music of The Toluenes‚Äô first two records. An unfinished song entitled Her Way Or The Highway was leaked on Youtube in October. Quatro Hello is scheduled for release on March 8, 2011. Bottle Rockets In 2006, Jamon and comedian/magician/actor Scott Sullivan co-created and co-starred in an independent t.v. pilot entitled Bottle Rockets. The proposed series is a 30-minute sitcom that is set in Nashville and revolves around a group of friends who are trying to make it in the entertainment business.Lavender, Dave (July 9, 2009). \\"Kentucky country-rock duo brings show back to area\\", The Herald-Dispatch. Retrieved November 29, 2010. Jamon‚Äôs character is a singer/songwriter with a penchant for getting into mishaps (usually brought on by a woman) and then writing and performing a song about it at the end of each episode. He drew on a repertoire of songs he had previously written.Ward, Lee (July 4, 2009). \\"Versatile Toluenes coming to Greenbo\\", The Independent. Retrieved November 29, 2010. The pilot won first place in the 2007 Indie Gathering Film Festival and was screened at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.

Although the band formed in Cali, the members are originally from the Colombian department of Choc√≥. The group consists of Carlos \\"Tostao\\" Valencia (rapping), Gloria \\"Goyo\\" Mart√≠nez (singing and rapping), and Miguel \\"Slow\\" Mart√≠nez (production and rapping). The band's music draws influence from a wide variety of modern genres including hip-hop and more recently electronica, combined with traditional Colombian genres including salsa, Latin jazz, and Afro-Latin rhythms. After growing up in Choc√≥ and forming in Cali, the ChocQuibTown relocated to Bogot√° and gained popularity performing in the city's bars. The group's first two albums, Somos Pac√≠fico (2006) and Oro (2010) were bolstered by the singles \\"Somos Pac√≠fico\\" and \\"De Donde Vengo Yo\\", with the latter song winning a Latin Grammy in 2011. The band's third album, Eso Es Lo Que Hay (2011) experienced further success, featuring the single \\"Hasta el Techo\\", followed by El Mismo (2015). The group's latest album, Sin Miedo, was released in 2018. History =Early years= Gloria Mart√≠nez (born 12 July 1982) and her younger brother Miguel (born 1986) were both born and grew up in the small town of Condoto in the department of Choc√≥ in western Colombia. They were exposed to a wide variety of music from a young age as their father Miguel had a large collection of records ranging from salsa and local chirimia bands to Western pop such as Michael Jackson and Gloria has said that her nickname \\"Goyo\\" comes from the fact that as a girl she loved listening to her father's records, in particular \\"Goyito Sabater\\" by the Puerto Rican band El Gran Combo - she sang along to the song so often that her family started calling her \\"Goyito\\", which was later shortened to \\"Goyo\\". Their father, Miguel, was from a musical family: his cousin was Jairo Varela, founder of Grupo Niche, one of Colombia's best known salsa bands. Due to his job as an electrician the Mart√≠nez family moved first to the department's capital Quibd√≥, where his children Gloria and Miguel first met and became friends with Quibd√≥ native Carlos Yahony Valencia (born 5 March 1981), and then later to the sea port of Buenaventura. As Colombia's major Pacific port the town saw a lot of trade coming in from the US, and the Mart√≠nez children started to hear American hip hop music from Los Angeles and other parts of the US, brought by the sailors on the ships. Having graduated from school in Buenaventura, Gloria moved to Cali to study psychology at university, while also becoming involved in the city's fledgling underground hip hop scene. It was in Cali in 2000 that she met Valencia again, who had moved with his mother to live in the city, and was now also involved in rapping. Over a meeting in one of Cali's parks, Valencia told Mart√≠nez about his idea to create a band to make a fusion of Colombian Afro-Caribbean music and hip hop from the perspective of the Afro-Caribbean people of the Choc√≥, and to promote this neglected corner and culture of Colombia, an idea that appealed to Mart√≠nez. Her brother Miguel, who had become interested in producing music on his computer, asked to join them, and ChocQuibTown was born. The band named themselves after the city and department that they had grown up in: Tostao said that \\"we chose the name because it's very sonorous, and in music all the elements you use must be focused in sound\\". =2004‚Äì2010: Early success and Oro= ChocQuibTown performing in 2007 Tostao convinced the Mart√≠nez siblings to move to Bogot√° to pursue their musical ambitions. In Bogot√°, Tostao sung with various local bands, including Mensajeros, Carbono and La Mojarra El√©ctrica. Goyo was invited to join the salsa/electronic group Sidestepper \\\\- the group's founders Richard Blair and Iv√°n Benavides heard the musical ideas of Tostao and Goyo and encouraged them to pursue their ambitions and record their own songs. The group played frequently at bars on Bogota's 7th Avenue, often without pay. The band received its big break at the \\"Hip Hop al Parque\\" festival in the capital in 2004, winning the competition for best band at the festival, their prize being $5,000 USD. The prize winnings funded the recording and production of the band's first album, Somos Pac√≠fico (2006). Somos Pac√≠fico was recorded and released independently by the band and produced by Blair and Benavides. Their music and live shows were gaining a reputation and in 2008 ChocQuibTown signed to Nacional Records and released their second album, Oro. The title, meaning \\"Gold\\" in English, is a reference to the exploitation of minerals in their native region, where gold miners barely make enough money to survive. The album also became their first international release with US and UK versions the following year, although these differed from the Colombian version, being compilations of tracks from both Somos Pac√≠fico and the Colombian release of Oro. The group undertook an extensive world tour in 2010 (including over 40 dates in Europe alone) which included the festivals of South by Southwest in the US, Glastonbury and Lovebox in the UK, Roskilde in Denmark, and Parkpop in the Netherlands. The group won a Latin Grammy in November 2010 for the single \\"De Donde Vengo Yo\\". The politically-charged song is a \\"spirited lament of the hard-luck life: multinationals and corrupt politicians get rich off gold and platinum; poor blacks get run off their land by illegal militias. Oro was nominated for Best Latin Alternative/Rock/Urban Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Richard Blair, producer of Oro, commented on the nomination by saying, \\"To get some official recognition, and from outside of Colombia at that, is almost the first time in 400 years that someone has recognized the people from Choco for something other than slavery and gold mines and corruption.\\" =2011‚Äì2014: Eso Es Lo Que Hay= ChocQuibTown performing at Central Park Summer Stage, New York City, 2011 Following the success of \\"De Donde Vengo Yo\\" at the Latin Grammys the band signed with Sony Music Colombia to support its follow-up album Eso Es Lo Que Hay. The group's third album, Eso Es Lo Que Hay, was released on Sony Music in November 2011, and was produced by Andr√©s Castro and Slow. The album contains a collaboration with Nicaraguan salsa singer Luis Enrique. At the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards, Eso Es Lo Que Hay was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Album, with the song \\"Calentura\\" featuring Puerto Rican rapper Tego Calder√≥n being nominated for Record of the Year. In 2013 the band released Behind the Machine (Detr√°s de la M√°quina), an album of songs from their previous albums re-recorded in a simpler, more stripped-down style. Goyo described it as an \\"organic album\\" made to \\"take back the essence and reflect it in an album that is very important for our career...it reflects a maturity in the sound\\". On this release, the band hoped to highlight specific instruments such as piano and marimba. The album also included the new jazz-influenced song \\"Condoto\\", an ode to Goyo and Slow's birthplace that was devastated by a powerful gale in May 2015. =2015‚Äìpresent: El Mismo and Sin Miedo= The band released El Mismo in 2015, led by the reggae-tinged love song \\"Cuando Te Veo\\". The single reached number 13 on the Billboard US Tropical Songs chart,[ Tropical Songs for ChocQuibTown]. Billboard.com. Retrieved October 7, 2012 number 16 on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Airplay chart,[ Latin Rhythm Airplay for ChocQuibTown]. Billboard.com. February 20, 2014 and number 29 on the Billboard US Latin Pop chart.[ Latin Pop Songs for ChocQuibTown]. Billboard.com. Retrieved October 7, 2012 Leila Cobo of Billboard noted a more commercial sound on El Mismo, viewing the album as an effort to transform the group from \\"critical curio to commercial star\\" that \\"appends pop song structure and stickier hooks to the band's eclecticism.\\" The group shot the music video for \\"Nuqu√≠ (Te Quiero Para M√≠)\\" on the beaches of Nuqu√≠ in Choc√≥ as a way to pay tribute to their home department and to encourage tourism to the area. In November 2017, the band signed with Sony Music Latin during a ceremony in Miami, and plans to released an album entitled Sin Miedo in 2018. In January 2018, the group collaborated with American pianist Arthur Hanlon on the single \\"No Tuve La Culpa\\", which peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Tropical Airplay chart. The music video, filmed in Colombia, features Hanlon and the band performing on a moving pickup truck. Musical style and image { style=\\"font-size:100%\\" align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" color=\\"black\\" width=130px  } The group mixes the modern sounds of hip-hop with more traditional Colombian genres such as salsa, Latin jazz, and coastal rhythms, utilizing instruments such as congas, timbales, bongos, and trumpets. Billboard writer Leila Cobo describe's the band by saying, \\"Chocquibtown hails from Colombia's rural Pacific coast, but honed its sound in Cali, a gritty city, and one can hear both in the trio's music: a melange of hip-hop, reggaeton, electronica, ska, Afro-Latin rhythms and rapper-singer Goyo Martinez's soulful charisma.\\" Phil Freeman of Allmusic compared the group to Elephunk-era Black Eyed Peas in its \\"upbeat performance style, lack of gangsta attitude, and male-female dynamic\\", stating that the group maintains a \\"positive attitude with a hint of edge, and dancefloor- and radio-friendly music, without devolving into pure pop pandering.\\" Lyrically, the band discusses Afro-Latino identity and taking pride in its native region. Member Tostao explains, \\"It is important to generate that pride for our people because our country is always talking about negative things like guerrillas and drug traffickers, that kind of thing and we want to show another side.\\" A common theme in the group's lyrics is the goal of attaining more inclusion for Afro-Colombians in the rest of Colombian society and in Latin America as a whole. The group hopes to denounce racism and discrimination in its lyrics without accusing non Afro-Colombian listeners of racism as to not alienate listeners from other areas. Songs such as \\"Oro\\" and \\"De Donde Vengo Yo\\" discuss exploitation of Choco's natural resources where minerals and other materials were extracted, leaving nothing for the region's inhabitants. The band is highly respected in its hometown. Eddi Marcelin, Cultural Diversity and Youth Manager of NGO ACDI/VOCA who hails from Choc√≥, explains ‚ÄúNot only are they popular in terms of musical value, but the people of Choc√≥, especially the youth, look up to them as role models. Through their music and success, ChocQuibTown provide hope that even someone coming from such a difficult area can overcome the hardships of life and achieve international fame.\\" In the band's lyrics and interviews, the members of ChocQuibTown have been openly critical of institutionalized racism in Colombia that they feel is often unacknowledged in Colombian society. The group has been praised for pointing out exclusion of Afro-Colombians in the media, from music to telenovelas. However, the band has received criticism from other Colombian hip-hop artists. The band was dissed in 2010 by Bogota-based hip-hop group Shakema Crew in the song \\"Game Over ChocQuibTown\\". In the song, Shakema Crew accused ChocQuibTown of being sell-outs that lack the authenticity of \\"real hip-hop\\", and threatened the band with violence by proclaiming \\"Death to ChocQuibTown\\".Dennis, p. 117 The diss track was criticized for containing lyrics that were considered racist. Bogota rapper JHT also criticized ChocQuibTown in his song \\"Mi Rap es Veneno / El Blues del Rap\\" for, in his view, diluting the authentic hip-hop sound by incorporating other musical genres. In response, ChocQuibTown claimed that for Colombian artists to challenge imperialism through music, artists must incorporate local musical styles instead of trying to emulate U.S. rappers.Dennis, p. 118 Personal life Tostao and Goyo have been a couple since 2002: they married on 7 December 2011 in a hacienda a short distance north of Bogota. In October 2012 they announced they were expecting their first child in April 2013.

The last of these was on 17 August 1904, when John executed John Kay at Armley Prison, and William hanged Samuel Holden at Winson Green Prison. Besides Ellis, John Billington also frequently worked with Henry Pierrepoint. In his career, Billington carried out a total of 26 hangings as an assistant and 16 as a chief executioner.

Teururai kings first ruled Huahine in the middle of the 19th century. By the end 19th century, a member of the Teururai dynasty also held thrones in Raiatea. Teururai monarchs ruled Huahine and Maia'o (from 1852) and Raiatea (from 1885) until the 1895 abdication of the each monarch during the French Third Republic annexation. The cadet line, the elected monarch of Raiatea, of the Teururai was deposed in 1888 whereas the senior line, for 7 years more, ruled until their Queen was deposed by French in 1895. Ari'imate was the first Teururai ruler of Huahine and Maia'o, from 1852. The Teururai is closely related to the other Tahitian royal dynasty as the Royal family of Tahiti, then to the Royal family of Raiatea. From this Huahinean line comes the last royal line of Raiatea and Tahaa.  Origins  400px The House of Teururai was originally a noble family from a chiefdom of Huahine. = The House of Teururai = In 1840, Chief Ari'imate of Huahine, only grandson of the governor of Huahine, married Princess Maerehia of Raiatea, only daughter and thus heiress to the King Tamatoa of Raiatea and Tahaa. The senior line of the Teururai remained, the ruling house of Huahine until 1895. This line was represented by Prince Marama, eldest son of King ariimate, through his eldest daughter, Queen Tehaapapa, the last sovereign of Huahine. He was regent to his Queen-daughter.  Teururai of Raiatea and Tahaa  The Raiatea line of the House of Teururai was founded and represented by Tamatoa VI. Indeed, the younger brother of Prince Marama, Prince Ariimate was designated King of Raiatea and Tahaa in 1884 and crowned in 1885. He was deposed by French in 1888. He became the last monarch of Raiatea and Tahaa. His descendant remains the royal family of Raiatea.

Allmusic journalist, Cub Koda, stated Nardella is a \\"strong, American roots-music performer, equally adept at rockabilly and low-down blues.\\" Biography Nardella became proficient on both guitar and harmonica by his late teens, and by the late 1960s was in the Black Cat Blues Band with Duke Robillard, Johnny Nicholas and Fran Christina. By 1971 Nardella, Nicholas and Christina had all relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan. Nardella then instigated the Boogie Brothers band with Sarah Brown, Nicholas and Christina. They backed a variety of blues musicians who toured locally, and were on the bill at the 1972 Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival, both as backing to Johnny Shines and Boogie Woogie Red, plus in their own right. Their work appeared on the Atlantic album, Ann Arbor Blues & Jazz Festival: 1972. By the following year, the band name had changed to the Vipers and included the guitarist George Bedard. Their single, \\"Huron River Drive,\\" was the first record to be released by Blind Pig. In 1974, Nardella backed Bobo Jenkins on his album Here I Am a Fool in Love Again. Other session musicians used included Brown and Christina. Nardella and Bedard then formed the Silvertones, who toured across the US, and released the 1977 album, One Chance With You, also on Blind Pig. In addition to his harmonica playing, Nardella introduced more of his own guitar work and singing to their output. With a change of personnel, in 1979 the renamed Steve Nardella Band issued, It's All Rock & Roll. The Steve Nardella Band lasted from 1978 to 1984. Nardella eventually became a solo artist and for years both toured and played backing to other musicians. His next album, Daddy Rollin' Stone did not appear until 1993. The same year, Nardella's trio backed Eddie Burns on his Scandinavian tour. Nardella also led the touring backing band for Jack Scott. In June 2008, Nardella, Bedard and their one time band pianist Mr. B (Mark Lincoln Braun), played a reunion concert in Ann Arbor's Firefly Club.

He then attended Clemson University where he obtained a BS in Physics and subsequently completed a PhD in physics at Syracuse University. He was a research physicist at the University of Rochester from 1969‚Äì1971 and at McGill University in Montreal, Canada from 1971-1977. Meggs departed from academic physics to pursue medicine afterward, and achieved a Doctorate of Medicine from the University of Miami in 1979. He then completed an Internal Medicine residency at Rochester General Hospital in 1982. Meggs then served as a Medical Staff Fellow at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health from 1982-1985. He obtained board certification in Emergency Medicine in 1988.North Carolina Medical Board While his career path has been varied, Meggs' main contributions to medicine have been in the arenas of Emergency Medicine and Medical Toxicology. Since 1991, Meggs has been affiliated with the Emergency Department at Vidant Medical Center, in Greenville, North Carolina, which is the flagship teaching hospital for the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University. During his first few years with the PCMH Emergency Department, Meggs successfully completed a fellowship in Medical Toxicology at the New York City Poison Center and Department of Emergency Medicine, Bellevue Hospital Center, affiliated with New York University. He currently serves as professor and chief of the Toxicology Department of the ECU Emergency Medicine Residency program. Meggs has published more than 60 articles in referred journals of toxicology and Emergency Medicine. His main research interests include antidotes to poisonings, poisonous snakebites, toxicity of pharmaceutical overdoses, effects of chronic low level exposures to pesticides, environmental factors in obesity, and the role of inflammation in overall health.PubMed His expertise has led to the total or partial authorships of three books: Gulf War illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans: Scientific Findings and Recommendations, The Inflammation Cure, and Biomarkers of Immunotoxicity. Meggs' book, The Inflammation Cure, which was released around the same time as Jack Challem's, The Inflammation Syndrome, won critical acclaim from the prestigious Library Journal who stated: \\"While Jack Challem's The Inflammation Syndrome covers similar ground [to the Inflammation Cure], his approach leans toward the faddish and sensationalist, while Meggs takes a more levelheaded approach, weaving the latest research on various diseases into a broad picture.\\" In 2010, Meggs was presented with American College of Medical Toxicology Award for Outstanding Contribution to Medical Toxicology Research for \\"contributions to medicine and science that have showed innovation and creativity in medical toxicology and related areas of study. His broad range of research has included investigating intracellular molecular polarity modeling; discovering and defining RUDS and inflammatory syndromes; establishing a link between organophosphate exposures and obesity; evaluating the anecdotal effect of heparin to teat anaphylactoid shock; and the best way to delay onset toxicity from potentially fatal snakebites.\\" His twin brother, Philip B.

Dating to the 6th century BC, the gold lamella is an early example of a block print. MS 5236 (inventory number of the Sch√∏yen Collection) is an ancient Greek amulet of the 6th century BC, which is unique in two respects: it is the only known magic amulet of the time inscribed with a text that was stamped as opposed to incised, and it is the only extant specimen of ephesia grammata made of gold. The only partially comprehensible inscription is an invocation of the god Phoebus Apollo and may have been composed in central Greece or western Asia Minor. As such magical amulets are known to have been mass-produced, the existence of MS 5236 indicates that, despite the singularity of the foil, an inkless block printing process was practised in ancient Greece to a certain degree, for texts of some length, beyond the examples known from Roman lead pipe inscriptions and the many types of stamps used to mark bricks and pottery with the maker's name and other details.  Description  The lamella is registered under the inventory number MS 5236 by the private Norwegian Sch√∏yen Collection,The Sch√∏yen Collection where it was studied by the British classicist Dominic Montserrat.Montserrat: \\"Report on Early Greek Gold Lamella\\", pp. 1‚Äì2 The printing technique of the inscription was specifically analysed by the German typographer Herbert Brekle in 2010.Brekle: \\"Analyse der Herstellungstechnik der Inschrift auf einem Goldamulett in der Schoyen Collection (London/Oslo)\\", pp. 1‚Äì5 MS 5236 is made of a thin, rectangular gold sheet of 2.8 x 9.0 x 0.1 cm, which is inscribed on one side. The ancient Greek text comprises six lines written from left to right; margins all around the text body suggest that its contents are fully preserved. The surface of the gold foil is marked by many small creases that have grown together into cracks. Unlike later amulets, it appears to have never been rolled up or folded for personal use.Montserrat, p. 1  Origin and date  The palaeographic analysis of the letterform indicates an early, archaic date. The script used does not clearly match any local variant of the Greek alphabet: certain letter shapes indicate an origin in Attica or Euboea, while other letters point to the ductus common in western Asia Minor, particularly that of Knidos. Overall, the comparison with other early Greek documents suggests a creation of the text in the middle of the 6th century BC.  Inscription and use  Transcribed inscription which opens with the words \\"O Phoebus Apollo who rules over man...\\" Even though the Greek text is legible on the whole (see transcription on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made any sense of. Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked in order to raise his arms against someone or something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery. According to Montserrat, important characteristics of MS 5236 most closely correspond to the ephesia grammata, magic amulets whose incantatory words were supposedly fixed in writing on the cult statue of Artemis at Ephesus, and which were carried on the body to ward off harm. Although these metal sheets circulated in the Greek world in huge numbers, only lead examples have survived, rendering the gold foil among the ephesia grammata unique.Montserrat, p. 2  Block print  The special significance of MS 5236 lies in the way the inscription was created. A close examination shows that a blind-stamping process was used to reproduce the Greek text on the lamella, with a single matrix carrying the whole text. In this, MS 5236 differs fundamentally from other amulets of the time, where the magic formulas were incised by hand, such as with a stylus, into the metal foil. The entire process is reconstructed by Brekle as follows: First, the inscription's text was engraved with an iron stylus into an even copper or bronze block, with its letters facing the opposite direction and running from right to left. The displaced material rose up on both sides of the letter grooves forming two sharp, parallel ridges. In the second step, the inscribed side of the stamp block was placed on the plane gold sheet and sufficient pressure, either manually or by hammering onto a plate laid on top, was exerted from above to transmit the text. What produced the print image were the ridges caused by the material displacement; these left shallow double lines in the foil, thus creating the text. The actual, sunken letter lines were not transferred during the imprinting procedure, since they did not enter the surface of the foil.Brekle, pp. 3‚Äì4 It is the existence of these fine double grooves on the gold lamella which provides the key for identifying MS 5236 as being stamped and not written. Because it is a matter of mechanical necessity that the engraved letters appear with their raised double edges on the substrate as parallel, sunken lines when being printed, as can be observed on the amulet. Thus, the inscription is a bas-relief, which was produced by a bas-relief stamp.Montserrat, in contrast, interprets MS 5236 as a high relief, which was created by relief printing. However, this assumption is‚Äîas Brekle states (p. 2‚Äì3)‚Äîflawed in several ways, as it was beyond the technical capabilities of the time to carve out the very delicate and fragile double lines in high relief from the stamp surface. Moreover, this procedure would have needed the high-relief stamp to be pressed through the gold foil from the reverse side‚Äîa method, however, by which the letter impressions would have appeared too blurred. The only possible remedy, namely the contouring of the letters by way of a prepared pad underneath, whose bas-relief forms correlate perfectly with those of the high-relief stamp, was not technically feasible then, either. This proves Montserrat's high-relief hypothesis to be untenable. If the text had been carved directly into the foil as with other amulets, the stylus could have left only simple lines. According to Brekle, the applied printing technique has much in common with the later method of drypoint etching, by which an image is incised into a copper plate; however, unlike drypoint, MS 5236 is a colourless blind print. A further indication for the use of a printing technique is the varying strength of the letters, which suggests that the surface of the lamella was not completely flat during printing. Thus, the outline of the letters, as to be expected with a print, appear in the slightly more elevated regions of the sheet (darker areas in the photo), more distinct than in the slightly deeper regions (lighter areas) that were not affected by the full force of the stamp. This can be observed particularly along the folds and in the last line where the edge of the foil was apparently slightly bent downwards while being printed. Consequently, the impressions of the letters appear less marked here. If the text had been directly inscribed with a stylus into the foil, these variations would not have occurred.Brekle, p. 4 Regarding the stroke order of the letters on the stamp, it can be said that the Hasta, the mostly vertical main line, was normally executed before the Coda figures.Brekle, p. 5 MS 5236 is an overall rare and possibly unique print from the early Greek era. Despite this, the widespread use of magical amulets indicates that such block prints were, at least from the present prototype, mass-produced at that time.

During his lifetime, Greene wrote over 23 books, presented more than 2,000 DIY programmes, and via his building company had provided bespoke construction services to over 32 stars of stage and television. Early life Henry Howard Greenhouse was born in Rhymney, near Caerphilly (then in Monmouthshire), to former Jack Greenhouse and his wife Una. His father, who had returned from fighting in World War I suffering from mustard gas poisoning, and mother were interested in the arts, poetry and music and regularly entertained at their home in Colenso Terrace. From aged 10, Greene would spend time on weekends with his uncle, a maintenance man and electrical engineer at Bargoed's Top Pit, who taught Greene to use tools properly. After passing the eleven-plus exam, he was accepted at Rhymney Grammar School, where in 1936 he won the National Eisteddfod under-17s prize for drawing. He was taught sport by Olympic swimmer C. B. Thomas, under whom Greene became a record-breaking runner at county level, gifted rugby union player, and champion junior Welsh long jumper. While training as an engineering draughtsman at Newport College of Art (now the University of South Wales) in 1939, he won a scholarship to study Architecture, Interior and Illustrative Design at Cardiff College of Art, with final year at Cardiff University. However, due to the outbreak of World War II he had to delay starting the course, and was subsequently attached to REME as a draughtsman, working on classified tank design for the Russian front. His father died from the effects of his earlier mustard gas poisoning in 1943. Career Post war, Greene took up his place at Cardiff College, training as a draughtsman's assistant and an architect. During this time he befriended fellow student and later Doctor Who script writer Terry Nation, who he worked together with on student productions and then working weekend with at the New Theatre, Cardiff as a stagehand. This led onwards to amateur acting with the Unity Theatre company, and as a volunteer assistant at Cory Hall on Eynon Evans weekly BBC Wales radio show, where he met Harry Secombe. Whilst training to become a teacher, he came up with a money-making idea to buy an ex-WD 350cc Royal Enfield motorbike. Using waste sheets of perforated laminate left over from sequin manufacturing, he made Christmas decorations in his student digs. On graduation, with his friend Henry Curly who also bought one, the pair travelled 6,000 miles through France, Switzerland and Italy. On return home, Greene took up the position of Art and Drama teacher at Tredegar Grammar School, earning ¬£20 a week. Taking a class to see a performance of Uranium 235 starring Joan Littlewood, his friend and producer of Unity Theatre introduced the pair. Littlewood was looking for a young Welshman to play Shakespeare's Owen Glendower, and Taffy in Ewan MacColl's Paradise Street. Additionally as the owner/producer of the touring company Theatre Workshop, she also wanted someone who could build theatre sets and drive the lorry. Greene resigned his teaching job the following day, and moved to Manchester to join the Theatre Workshop, often earning less than ¬£5 a week from the company's takings. In 1949, he changed his name to Harry Greene by deed poll. After two years the company moved to a new base at the near- derelict Theatre Royal music hall in Stratford, London. After Greene designed and organised the theatre's reconstruction programme, the first production was Twelfth Night in late 1953, for which Greene made the sets and then acted in. On New Year's Day 1954, the company had 200 applicants for their next production, including actress Marjie Lawrence. Greene and Lawrence quickly became a couple, and married in 1955. Theatre Workshop became such a success, that productions would later transfer to London's West End theatre, bringing both Greene and Lawrence to national attention. Through his acting career, Greene starred in over 40 films, opposite actors including Sean Connery, Sir John Gielgud, Melina Mercouri, Lana Turner and Jean Seberg. DIY expert At the launch of independent broadcaster Associated Rediffusion, the couple starred in soap opera Round the Redways, about a couple who run a DIY store, with Greene playing an inept repair man. Desperate to fill the schedules, Associated Rediffusion took up Marjie's proposal for Harry to film a DIY show based on him doing up their flat in Primrose Hill, North London. First shown on 4 January 1957, Handy Round the Home emphasised practical demonstrations that viewers could copy at home, with his catchphrase, \\"Safety first; DIY second\\" making him a household name. In the 1980s Greene was employed by Greg Dyke at TV-AM, devising, writing and producing Dream Home, which Greene co- presented alongside his daughter Sarah. Greene persuaded the company to buy a dilapidated cottage in Hampshire, which they then filmed him doing up and converting through construction. At the end of the project, the house was given away in a competition. He then joined the BBC's Pebble Mill at One, where he built a new house from scratch with an accompanying team. After this he set up a building company, which specialised in providing new homes, extensions and bespoke building services to actors and television personalities. By 2000, the firm had provided services to over 32 stars, including Barbara Windsor, Si√¢n Lloyd, Paul McKenna and Neil Morrissey. In the early 1990s, although still presenting, Greene created and acted as a consultant on the new genre of DIY programmes, including DIY SOS, Changing Rooms, House Doctor and DIY Challenge.

Although in some countries the term maritime boundary represents borders of a maritime nationUnited States Department of State, Maritime boundaries ; retrieved 19 Nov 2010. that are recognized by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, maritime borders usually serve to identify the edge of international waters. Maritime boundaries exist in the context of territorial waters, contiguous zones, and exclusive economic zones; however, the terminology does not encompass lake or river boundaries, which are considered within the context of land boundaries. Some maritime boundaries have remained indeterminate despite efforts to clarify them. This is explained by an array of factors, some of which involve regional problems.Valencia, Mark J. (2001). The delineation of maritime boundaries has strategic, economic and environmental implications.Geoscience Australia, Law of the Sea and Maritime Jurisdiction Project. Terminology The terms boundary, frontier and border are often used as if they were interchangeable, but they are also terms with precise meanings.Prescott, John Robert Victor. (2008). A boundary is a line. The terms \\"frontier\\", \\"borderland\\" and \\"border\\" are zones of indeterminate width. Such areas forms the outermost part of a country. Borders are bounded on one side by a national boundary.Prescott, There are variations in the specific terminology of maritime boundary agreements which have been concluded since the 1970s. Such differences are less important than what is being delimited.Charney, =Features= Features that affect maritime boundaries include islands and the submerged seabed of the continental shelf. The process of boundary delimitation in the ocean encompasses the natural prolongation of geological features and outlying territory. The process of establishing \\"positional\\" borders encompasses the distinction between previously resolved and never-resolved controversies.Koo, Min Gyu. (2010). citing Friedrich V. Kratochwil, Paul Rohrlich, Harpreet Mahajan. (1985). Peace and disputed sovereignty, p. 20. =Limits= The limits of maritime boundaries are expressed in polylines and in polygon layers of sovereignty and control,VLIZ, Intro calculated from the declaration of a baseline. The conditions under which a state may establish such baseline are described in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). A baseline of a country can be the low water line, a straight baseline (a line that encloses bays, estuaries, inland waters,...) or a combination of the two. =Zones= The zones of maritime boundaries are expressed in concentric limits surrounding coastal and feature baselines. * Inland waters--the zone inside the baseline. * Territorial sea--the zone extending 12 nm. from the baseline. * Contiguous zone--the area extending 24 nm. from the baseline. * Exclusive Economic Zone--the area extending 200 nm. from the baseline except when the space between two countries is less than 400 nm. In the case of overlapping zones, the boundary is presumed to conform to the equidistance principle or it is explicitly described in a multilateral treaty. Contemporary negotiations have produced tripoint and quadripoint determinations. For example, in the 1982 Australia‚ÄìFrance Marine Delimitation Agreement, for the purposes of drawing the treaty's equidistant lines it was assumed that France has sovereignty over Matthew and Hunter Islands, a territory that is also claimed by Vanuatu. The northernmost point in the boundary is a tripoint with the Solomon Islands. The boundary runs in a roughly north‚Äìsouth direction and then turns and runs west‚Äìeast until it almost reaches the 170th meridian east.Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). ; Charney, Jonathan I. et al. (1993). International Maritime Boundaries, Vol. 1, p. 905; Charney, (1998). History The concept of maritime boundaries is a relatively new concept. The historical record is a backdrop for evaluating border issues.Koo, The evaluation of historic rights are governed by distinct legal regimes in customary international law, including research and analysis based on * acquisition and occupationJagota, S. P. * the existence of rights ipso facto and ab initio. The study of treaties on maritime boundaries is important as (a) as a source of general or particular international law; (b) as evidence of existing customary law; and (c) as evidence of the emerging development of custom.Jagota, S. P. The development of \\"customary law\\" affects all nations. The attention accorded this subject has evolved beyond formerly-conventional norms like the three-mile limit. =Treaties= Multilateral treaties and documents describing the baselines of countries can be found on the website of the United Nations. For example, the Australia‚ÄìFrance Marine Delimitation Agreement establishes ocean boundaries between Australia and New Caledonia in the Coral Sea (including the boundary between Australia's Norfolk Island and New Caledonia). It consists of 21 straight-line maritime segments defined by 22 individual coordinate points forming a modified equidistant line between the two territories. Disputes Controversies about territorial waters tend to encompass two dimensions: (a) territorial sovereignty, which are a legacy of history; and (b) relevant jurisdictional rights and interests in maritime boundaries, which are mainly due to differing interpretations of the law of the sea.Ji Guoxing. (1995). \\"Maritime Jurisdiction in the Three China Seas,\\" p. 3, UC Berkeley: UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation; retrieved 15 Nov 2010. An example of this may be reviewed in the context of the ongoing Kuwait-Iraq maritime dispute over the Khawr Abd Allah waterway. Many disputes have been resolved through negotiations,Chris Carleton et al.

The title comes from a red-colored dress shown through the film, meant to symbolize the main character's occupation as a \\"scarlet woman\\" (a prostitute). Plot A woman, Gabrielle Darley, shoots a man, Howard Blaine, in the back as he is buying a wedding ring, then asks pardon and expresses love to his corpse as she waits for arrest. In her jail cell, she is supported by a kind matron. At her trial, she is asked to explain how she came to shoot Blaine, and she narrates her story. Blaine courted her and claimed he would marry her, and she left her unloving family to go with him to New Orleans. There, Blaine did not marry her but only took her to a house in a sleazy neighbourhood; in a bedroom there, a mirror vision of herself in bridal attire gave way to a vision of herself in a red dress (strikingly hand- coloured in the film), indicating that she knew she was entering on a life of prostitution. She gave in for love of Blaine, and spent several miserable years servicing men he sent in to her, spurred on by little love notes from him. The mocking prosecutor suggests that she shot Blaine out of jealousy because he was going to marry another woman, and she acknowledges this and points out that he was buying the ring with money she earned for him. Women in the courtroom cry. Despite the prosecutor's finger-wagging and the judge's frivolous boredom, the all-male jury votes her Not Guilty. Gabrielle tells the kind matron that she would now like to redeem herself by working to help people, and drops her brilliant red dress on the floor as a sign that she will never go back to that work. Beverly Fontaine, a society matron fond of getting publicity by taking up reformed criminals, invites her to come live at her house. There, she meets the nice chauffeur Terrance O'Day, but is put on display at parties for Beverly's friends and tormented by tactless questions about her prostitution work. Terrance takes her on a sweet, wholesome date to an amusement park, and she realizes that there is a good kind of man she has never encountered before. Beverly gets tired of her and goes on a trip, with Terrance driving her, leaving Gabrielle a letter to the superintendent of a local hospital about training as a nurse. The superintendent, however, recognizes her and throws her out. She is unable to get work, losing her job as a maid when she gets upset at seeing her defense attorney's wife wearing her ring she had to give him as her fee. Starving and desperate, she telegraphs to Clara, a supportive friend in the New Orleans brothel, to send her the train fare to return there and take up her old profession. Clara does. The telegraph operator is a friend of Terrance's, and goes to Beverly Fontaine's house to tell him of this just as she and Terrance return from her trip. Terrance throws up his job and commandeers Beverly's car to drive to the train station to stop Gabrielle, but is five minutes too late. He gets on the next train, and, in New Orleans, takes a taxi to the address on the telegram. Meanwhile, Gabrielle, hesitating on the doorstep of the brothel, is attacked by a brute, and is hit by a car as she runs from him. Terrance sees the accident, but does not realize it is she. Hearing from Clara that she has not shown up yet, he hangs around the street looking for her for days. Gabrielle is recovering in the hospital when she overhears staff people saying that, because the U.S. has just entered World War I and the flu pandemic has started, they are in desperate need of additional nurses and helpers. She offers herself, and is hired. She is scrubbing the hospital floor when Terrance enters in uniform, having enlisted and serving as an ambulance driver. They are reunited, and he asks her to marry him before he goes overseas. She declares her love but postpones their marriage till he comes back and she has worked longer and become worthy of a happy life with him. A woman who has been keeping an album of clippings about Gabrielle, who seems to be Beverly's maid, tells us that this happy life was attained for these two. But Gabrielle is only one of many women in this terrible situation, she says, and it is up to all women to help their unfortunate sisters. Production background The film is notable today for being one of the few independent productions produced and written by women. This is the third of Davenport's \\"social conscience\\" releases, preceded by Human Wreckage (1923) on the topic of drug addiction (released five months after Wallace Reid's death from morphine), and Broken Laws (1924) about excessive mother-love. The film is based on a real case of prostitution that took place in New Orleans in 1917. This film, billing itself as a true story, used the real name of the woman played by Priscilla Bonner who as a consequence sued producer Dorothy Davenport and won. The case, Melvin v Reid has been cited recently in the emerging \\"right to be forgotten\\" cases around the world as an early example of one's right to leave a past one wishes to forget. In the ruling of the California Appellate Court (Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931)) the Court stated, \\"any person living a life of rectitude has that right to happiness which includes a freedom from unnecessary attacks on his character, social standing or reputation.\\" As with Davenport's earlier Human Wreckage in 1924, this film was banned in the United Kingdom by the British Board of Film Censors in 1926.The Red Kimono at the silentera.com database In the 1920s, the film was also banned in the city of Chicago.

The Pocasset Mills, where the fire began The Great Fall River fire of 1928 occurred on February 2‚Äì3, 1928 and destroyed a vast portion of downtown Fall River, Massachusetts. Although the city has had many other large fires, both before and after, the 1928 conflagration is generally considered the worst in the city's history, since it destroyed so many businesses at a time when the city's economy was already struggling from recent textile plant closings. By the time the fire was out, five city blocks were completely wiped out.http://www.sailsinc.org/durfee/fire.pdf Nobody was killed and only a few people suffered serious injuries. The blaze At 5:45 p.m. on February 2, 1928, the fire broke out in Mill No. 2 of the Pocasset Manufacturing Company on Pocasset Street. It was a bitter cold evening and demolition workers had been dismantling the recently shuttered mills.Fall River Herald News, October 17, 1978 The flames spread quickly through the mill complex. Within an hour, Fire Chief Jeremiah F. Sullivan sounded three alarms and called for outside help. By about 7:00 p.m. fire apparatus and departments from surrounding towns and as far away as Boston and Lowell would arrive to provide assistance. A brisk southwest wind caused the flames to cross Central Street and hampered fire suppression. The wind shifted again to the west, spreading the fire across North Main Street. The wind shifted again to the northwest and drove the fire across Bedford Street. Temperatures hit a record low mark for the season, causing the fire hoses to freeze and hampering the efforts of the firemen. At 2:30 a.m. the fire was declared under control. City Hall was damaged but had been saved. Various buildings in scattered sections of the area were still burning though. It was not until Saturday noon, nearly two days after its start, that the fire was officially declared out. Police, National Guardsmen and Naval Reservists also provided assistance with securing the fire damaged areas. Total damage was estimated at $20,000,000, although the actual amount was widely disputed by local businessmen.Time Magazine Article, February 13, 1928 The cause of the blaze was determined to have started with a spark from a Salamander heater being used by the demolition crew to keep warm. Within just a few years, many of the banks and commercial businesses were rebuilt, including the Granite Block, at the heart of the business district.

Post-independence period Until 1991, both countries were constituent republics within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Following the declarations of independence of Croatia and Slovenia in June 1991, the Republic of Macedonia declared its independence three months later in September 1991. The army of rump Yugoslavia peacefully left the Republic of Macedonia, therefore the Republic of Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav republic that gained independence without conflict or war. However, bilateral relations were not established immediately. Establishment of bilateral relations The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed in 1992 by the remaining Yugoslav republics Montenegro and Serbia. It established diplomatic relations with the Republic of Macedonia on 8 April 1996.Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Republic of Macedonia The establishment of bilateral relations was conducted under the country's constitutional name - Republic of Macedonia.Republic of Serbia - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Serbia, therefore, is one of 131Bolivia is 131. country to use Macedonia's constitutional name Ekonom:east Media Group. 20-01-2011 countries in the world that recognize the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name.

Following the establishment of bilateral relations, both countries maintained friendly relations, but following the Republic of Macedonia's recognition of Kosovo's independence in October 2008, the ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia was expelled from Serbia. The break in relation lasted a few months. However, Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia agreed to reestablish bilateral relations. The new ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia took office in Serbia in May 2009. The new ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia to Serbia is the former speaker of parliament and former ambassador to Bulgaria, Ljubisa Georgievski. Church row A church row has burdened the relations in the past. The Serbian Orthodox Church does not recognize the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which declared autocephaly from the Serbian church in 1967. On a visit to the Republic of Macedonia in May 2009, the President of Serbia, Boris Tadiƒá, pointed out that his country wishes a settlement to that issue. The Serbian Orthodox Church in the past blocked the visit of the Republic of Macedonia state delegations to the Prohor Pƒçinjski Monastery in southern Serbia on the Republic of Macedonia's Day of the Republic, the place where the foundations of the Republic of Macedonia's statehood were laid during World War II at the first plenary session of ASNOM. In 2009, however, the Serbian Orthodox Church surprisingly allowed a visit by a Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia delegation. Kosovo dispute In December 2017, it became known that Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, intended to support Kosovo's ascension to UNESCO. The Serbian government responded that they would no longer recognize the country by the name Republic of Macedonia if they continued such efforts. Serbian foreign minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá stated that it was an example of hypocrisy from Zoran Zaev's government.\\"Serbia could revoke recognition of 'Republic of Macedonia'\\". B92.

The model states that individuals can process messages in one of two ways: heuristically or systematically. Whereas systematic processing entails careful and deliberative processing of a message, heuristic processing entails the use of simplifying decision rules or ‚Äòheuristics‚Äô to quickly assess the message content. The guiding belief with this model is that individuals are more apt to minimize their use of cognitive resources (i.e., to rely on heuristics), thus affecting the intake and processing of messages. HSM predicts that processing type will influence the extent to which a person is persuaded or exhibits lasting attitude change. HSM is quite similar to the elaboration likelihood model, or ELM. Both models were predominantly developed in the early to mid-1980s and share many of the same concepts and ideas.Albarracin, D., Johnson, B. T., & Zanna, M. P. (2005). The handbook of attitudes. Mahwah, N.J: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers.  History  Early research investigating how people process persuasive messaging focused mainly on cognitive theories and the way the mind processed each element of a message. One of the early guiding principles of underlying motivations of persuasive communications came from Leon Festinger‚Äôs (1950) statement that incorrect or improper attitudes are generally maladaptive and can have deleterious behavioral and affective consequences. In 1953, Hovland, Janis, and Kelley noted that a sense of \\"rightness\\" accompanies holding opinions similar to the opinions of others. In 1987, Holtz and Miller reaffirmed this line of thought by noting, \\"When other people are perceived to hold similar attitudes, one's confidence in the validity of one's own attitude is increased.\\"Petty, R.E. & Cacioppo, J.T. (1986), Communication and Persuasion: Central and Peripheral Routes to Attitude Change. New York; Springer-Verlag Another concept that contributed to the HSM was the sufficiency principle. This principle reflected widespread notions that people use limited cognitive resources, or use an \\"economy- minded\\" approach to information processing when presented with persuasive information. Based on this thought, early assumptions said people were at least partially guided by the \\"principle of least effort\\". This principle stated that in the interest of economy, the mind would often process with the least amount of effort (i.e., use a heuristic), and for more detailed information processing would use more effortful processing (systematic). This was the major difference when compared with the ELM, which described the two different ways information was processed, through central and/or peripheral processing.Chaiken, S., & Trope, Y. (1999). Dual-process theories in social psychology . New York: Guilford Press. The developer and main researcher of the HSM was Shelly Chaiken. Under her direction, the HSM has undergone several major revisions. As she noted in 1980 and 1987, the model specified the two modes of heuristic and systematic processing. Then, Chaiken et al. noted in 1989 that the model was extended to specify the psychological conditions for triggering the modes of processing in terms of the discrepancy between actual and desired subjective confidence. In 1986, Chaiken, and others, updated the model to include underlying motivations.Dillard, James, and Michael Pfau. The persuasion handbook: developments in theory and practice. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2002. Print.  Heuristic processing  Heuristic processing uses judgmental rules known as knowledge structures that are learned and stored in memory. The heuristic approach offers an economic advantage by requiring minimal cognitive effort on the part of the recipient.Chaiken, S. (1980). Heuristic Versus Systematic Information Processing and the Use of Source Versus Message Cues in Persuasion. Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 39(5), 752-766. Retrieved from SocINDEX database. Heuristic processing is related to the concept of \\"satisficing.\\" Heuristic processing is governed by availability, accessibility, and applicability. Availability refers to the knowledge structure, or heuristic, being stored in memory for future use. Accessibility of the heuristic applies to the ability to retrieve the memory for use. Applicability of the heuristic refers to the relevancy of the memory to the judgmental task.Chen, S., Duckworth, K., & Chaiken, S. (1999). Motivated Heuristic and Systematic Processing. Psychological Inquiry, 10(1), 44. Retrieved from SocINDEX database Due to the use of knowledge structures, a person using heuristic information processing is likely to agree with messages delivered by experts, or messages that are endorsed by others, without fully processing the semantic content of the message.Eagly, A.H. & Chaiken, S. (1993). Process theories of attitude formation and change: The elaboration likelihood and heuristic-systematic models. In A.H. Eagly & S. Chaiken, (Eds.), The psychology of attitudes. Orlando: Harcourt Brace: pp. 303-350. In comparison to systematic processing, heuristic processing entails judging the validity of messages by relying more on accessible context information, such as the identity of the source or other non-content cues. Thus, heuristic views de-emphasize detailed information evaluation and focus on the role of simple rules or cognitive heuristics in mediating persuasion. Individuals may be more likely to use heuristic processing when an issue is less personally important to them (they have low ‚Äúissue involvement‚Äù) or when they believe their judgment will not have significant impacts on themselves (low ‚Äúresponse involvement‚Äù).  Systematic processing  Systematic processing involves comprehensive and analytic, cognitive processing of judgment-relevant information. The systematic approach values source reliability and message content, which may exert stronger impact on persuasion, when determining message validity. Judgments developed from systematic processing rely heavily on in-depth treatment of judgment-relevant information and respond accordingly to the semantic content of the message. Recipients developing attitudes from a systematic basis exert considerable cognitive effort and actively attempt to comprehend and evaluate the message's arguments. When processing systematically, recipients also attempt to assess their validity as it relates to the message's conclusion. Systematic views of persuasion emphasize detailed processing of message content and the role of message-based cognitions in mediating opinion change. While recipients utilizing systematic processing rely heavily on message content, source characteristics and other non-content may supplement the recipients‚Äô assessment of validity in the persuasive message.  Choosing systematic or heuristic processing  Both heuristic and systematic processes may occur independently. It is also possible for both to occur simultaneously in an additive fashion or in a way that the judgmental implications of one process lend a bias nature to the other. The heuristic-systematic model includes the hypothesis that attitudes developed or changed by utilizing heuristic processing alone will likely be less stable, less resistant to counterarguments, and will be less predictive of subsequent behavior than attitudes developed or changed utilizing systematic processing. Message recipients using heuristic processing may sometimes choose to accept message conclusions they would otherwise have rejected, or vice versa, had they invested more time and effort to scrutinize the message. Source credibility affects persuasion under conditions of low, but not high, issue-involvement and response-involvement. When economic concerns are predominant, the recipient will likely use heuristic processing to form a judgment about the persuasive argument. Conversely, when reliability concerns are predominant (i.e., recipients perceive significant importance in accurately judging an argument), they will likely use a systematic processing strategy. Reliability concerns are influenced by the level of the recipient's issue-involvement or response-involvement. When the recipient views their judgment as being less consequential, they will likely place greater value on economic concerns than reliability concerns.  Practical application  Research into information processing, especially in persuasive messaging, has a natural application in advertising. For instance, HSM has been used in Internet webpage considerations. In a 2002 study by Wathen & Burkell, they proposed a theory that separated the evaluation process into distinct segments. In the theory, the process began with low-effort examinations of peripheral cues (e.g., appearance, design, organization, and source reputation) then continued to a more high-effort analysis of the content of the information source. The proposed research also drew on social psychological theories of dual- processing, which stated that information processing outcomes were the result of interaction between a fast, associative information-processing mode based on low-effort heuristics, and a slow, rule-based information processing mode based on high-effort systematic reasoning. Wathen and Burkell proposed (but did not test) that if an individual determines that an online source does not meet an appropriate level of credibility at any one stage, then he or she will leave the site without further evaluation. They theorized that this ‚Äúeasy to discard‚Äù behavior was indicative of information-rich environments, where the assumption is that many other potential sources of information exist, and spending too much time on any one source is potentially wasteful.Wathen, C. N., & Burkell, J. (2002). Believe it or not: Factors influencing credibility on the Web. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 53(2), 134‚Äì144 The HSM has also been applied in medical decision- making contexts. A 2004 study by Suzanne K. Steginga, PhD, and Stefano Occhipinti, PhD, Queensland Cancer Fund and the School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia, investigated the utility of the heuristic-systematic processing model as a framework for the investigation of patient decision making. A total of 111 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer were assessed using verbal protocol analysis and self-report measures. The results showed: \\"Most men (68%) preferred that decision making be shared equally between them and their doctor. Men's use of the expert opinion heuristic was related to men's verbal reports of decisional uncertainty and having a positive orientation to their doctor and medical care; a desire for greater involvement in decision making was predicted by a high internal locus of health control. Trends were observed for systematic information processing to increase when the heuristic strategy used was negatively affect-laden and when men were uncertain about the probabilities for cure and side effects. There was a trend for decreased systematic processing when the expert opinion heuristic was used. Findings were consistent with the heuristic-systematic processing model and suggest that this model has utility for future research in applied decision making about health issues.  Direction of future research  Originally the heuristic-systematic model was developed to apply to \\"validity seeking\\" persuasion contexts in which peoples' primary motivation is to attain accurate attitudes that align with relevant facts. Chaiken assumes that the primary processing goal of accuracy-motivated recipients is to assess the validity of persuasive messages, and that both heuristic and systematic processing can serve this objective. Other motives beyond the validity-seeking persuasion context were identified by Chaiken and colleagues (1989) who proposed an expanded model that posits two additional motives that heuristic and systematic processing can serve: defense-motivation and impression-motivation. * Defense-motivation is the desire to form or defend particular attitudinal positions. * Impression-motivation is the desire to form or hold socially acceptable attitudinal positions. Contrary to previous viewpoints, the heuristic-systematic model and the elaboration likelihood model should be treated as complementary models to create a dual-processing framework for use in future research for understanding a variety of social influence phenomena.  Criticisms  A major criticism of HSM is that the model closely relates to ELM, which is also a dual-processing model discussing two main paths to persuasion. The ELM discusses the two routes as \\"central\\" route processing and \\"peripheral\\" route processing. ELM's central processing has been likened to systematic processing in HSM, while peripheral processing is similar to HSM's heuristic processing. These two routes of processing define related theories behind attitude change. In ELM, the central route is reflective and requires a willingness to process and think about the message. The peripheral route occurs when attitudes are formed without extensive thought, but more from mental shortcuts, credibility, and appearance cues. The route of persuasion processing depends on the level of involvement in the topic or issue. High involvement or elaboration increases central route processing especially when motivation and ability in the message exists. Therefore, low involvement increases peripheral route processing when motivation and ability conditions of persuasion do not exist. However, if the topic or idea is irrelevant to the individual, then the message takes the peripheral route.Griffin, E. A. (2006). A first look at communication theory (6th ed.) Boston, MA; McGraw Hill HSM specifically examines validity seeking persuasion settings concerning people's motivations within the social environment. The limitation of HSM exists in the inability to define the specific motivations of persuasion, which is why Chaiken expanded HSM to illustrate that heuristic and systematic processing can \\"serve defense- motivation, the desire to form or defend particular attitudinal positions, and impression- motivation, the desire to form or hold socially acceptable attitudinal positions\\" (p. 326). Major assumptions exist with both HSM and ELM, which is why both models have generated debate and are often misconstrued. Systematic processing assumes that persuasion has occurred via the recipient's understanding and cognitive elaboration of the persuasive argument. In addition, researchers hypothesize that systematic processing requires and uses cognitive capacity, while heuristic processing makes low cognitive demands. Furthermore, both HSM and ELM assume that \\"capacity and motivation are important determinants of systematic process\\" which results in biased modes of processing (p. 327). With heuristic processing, there is less need to process information and cognitively in comparison to systematic processing. Heuristic processing occurs when people simply form immediate decisions and conclusions based on the information available versus analytical processing of information given that obviously requires more cognition. Heuristic processing as defined by HSM, illustrates that people can formulate decisions utilizing basic rules such as \\"experts' statements can be trusted\\" and \\"consensus implies correctness\\" to establish validity within messages (p. 327). Therefore, individuals who process messages through heuristic processing routes of persuasion, likely formulate decisions based on experts‚Äô opinion and what the consensus believes opposed to fully processing the message in its entirety. This leads to another similarity between HSM and ELM, as attitudes and opinions developed through heuristic processing will tend to be \\"less stable, less resistant to counter-propaganda, and less predictive of behavior\\" in comparison to attitudes and opinions formed through detailed information within systematic processing (p. 327). HSM postulates that heuristic and systematic processing can each influence both \\"independent\\" and \\"interdependent\\" effects on decision making by occurring simultaneously (p. 328). Unlike HSM, ELM does not postulate whether central route processing and peripheral route processing can co-occur or not. Another assumption by Chaiken and her colleagues is that systematic processing does in fact provide people with more judgment relevant information in comparison to heuristic processing of information, which does not account for any weaknesses in expert subject matter material. Therefore, while systematic processing may be prevalent within many social environments, HSM, unlike its model counterpart ELM, does illustrate \\"the possibility that heuristic processing can exert a significant and independent influence on persuasion\\" (p 329).

Definition In Irish Kings and High Kings, Francis John Byrne defines Fortuatha as \\"kingdoms not ruled directly by members of the dominant dynasty of a province\\" (p. 45). T. F. O'Rahilly in Early Irish History and Mythology states Fortuatha \\"means in effect people belonging to a different stock from that of the rulers of the territory\\" (p. 27), yet sometimes enjoying a position of favour with the ruling people. Fortuatha groups Population-groups termed fortuatha included the Calraige, Ciarraige, Corca Fhir Tr√≠, Delbhna, D√©isi, Gailenga, Grecraige, Luighne, Masraige and Setantii. The status of each population-group could differ from one part of the island to another, with some fortuatha being class as Aithechth√∫atha in other regions. In Leinster, some reckoned among the Fortuatha had previously held the provincial kingship. This was the D√°l Messin Corb and its principal septs, the U√≠ Garrchon and the U√≠ Enechglaiss. The Fortuatha * Fothairt in Chairn - located in the barony of Forth, County Wexford. * Fothairt Mag Fea - located in the barony of Forth, County Carlow. * Fotharta Fer C√∫l - * Fotharta Airthir Liphe - located along the banks of the east Liffey. * Fotharta Airbrech fri Br√≠ Ele aniar - bordering the Kingdom of U√≠ Failghe. * Fotharta Bile, alias Fotharta File - * Fotharta Fea - * Fotharta Tuile - * Fotharta Imchlair (or in cl√°ir) - Clan Corpri, around Donaghmore, County Tyrone and near Armagh, County Armagh * Fothar Breg, alias Fothar Mac nDeichill of Brega * Fotharta Maige Itha - around Lough Swilly in County Donegal, who were divided into the following seven Aicme or tribes: Ui Deaga, Ui Setna, Ui Dimai, Ui Eircc, Ui Chormaic, Ui Niath and Ui Duirrtheacht. The Fothairt are referenced in Leabhar Ua Maine. Their genealogies are preserved in Leabhar na nGenealach, the Great Book of Lecan, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 502, and/or Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 512. History D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n writes that \\"The Fothairt were the original population group around the site of Bridgit's monastery at Kildare\\" (p. 197), further stating that the U√≠ Erc√°in, a branch of the U√≠ Meic Cruaich (a sub-sept of the Fothairt) \\"are remembered in the 'Vita Tripartia' as having been specially favoured by Patrick, who blessed them (Dobert P√°traic bendachtain ... for Uu hErc√° huili) and their king, Fergnae mac Cobthaig, who is also mentioned in the life of Fintan/Munnu of Tagmon, where he encounters the saint in campo Lyffi ('in the Liffy plain').\\" (p. 197). The kingship of Leinster was held from the mid-8th century to 1042 by the U√≠ D√∫nlainge, who bolstered their early gains \\"by means of political marriage with S√°rnat, daughter of Eochu mac Ba√≠th of the Fothairt\\" (p. 197). A branch of the Forthairt, the U√≠ Brigti, explicitly claimed a connection with Bridgit (p. 198). In addition, two kings of Forthairt, Fergus mac M√≥enaig and Dub d√° Chrich mac aui Cellaig mec Triein, \\"as well as 'many others, omitted for the sake of brevity'\\", were killed at the battle of Ath Senaig (Ballyshannon, near Kilcullen, County Kildare) in 738 as supporters of King √Åed of Leinster (p. 200). Despite their political eclipse, the Fothairt \\"continued to supply leading clergy to Kildare. To Ui Ch√∫lduib ... belonged the two abbesses, Muirenn (d. 918) and Eithne (d. 1016); to the obscure Forthair Airbrech belonged the earlier abess, Sebdann (d. 732) and another Kildare ecclesiastic (d. 750); while two further abbesses, Coblaith (d. 916) and Muirenn (d. 964), belonged to an ecclesiastical branch of Forthairt Fea. And it is highly probable that many other Kildare clerics, whose origins cannot be established with certainty, belonged to Fotharta.\\" (p. 586, NHI) Indeed, the U√≠ Erc√°in were noted in the 'Tripartite Life' as being blessed by Saint Patrick, who promised them that not only would they never be subjects of an \\"outside\\" king, but that \\"they [would] have their own brithemnas, capacity of judging and being judged, in their own territory. *(p. 873, NHI) People Among the early medieval Irish were many notable people whose population-group were classed as Fortuatha.

It is named after herpetologist Duncan R. MacRae, founder of the reptile park Rimba on Bali.. www.reptile-database.org.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Varanus macraei, p. 165). Geographic range  The distribution of V. macraei is restricted to the island of Batanta, on the northwestern tip of the Vogelkop peninsula of Irian Jaya of Indonesia. There this species lives like its relatives, the other members of the prasinus-group, as a tree climber, which is clearly visible by the prehensile tail. This may be the smallest distribution of any tree monitor, as this island has a size of only 450 km2, which is comparable with Lake Constance of Central Europe. Habitat The blue-spotted tree monitor inhabits tropical forests that average 83‚Äì100 ¬∞F (28-38 ¬∞C). In the dry season the humidity is around 65%, but it spikes to 100% in the wet season. Description Detail of head and upper body Varanus macraei is part of the prasinus-group and the subgenus (Hapturosaurus). As its common names suggest, it is black with scattered blue scales, forming ocellations that may in turn form bands across the back. The tip of the snout is light blue and the lower jaw is white with uniform green scales along the neck, forming a v-shaped pattern. There are less than 9 dorsal crossbands and the legs are heavily spotted with turquoise ocelli. There are 85‚Äì103 scale rows at midbody. A single distinct blue scale row stretches from the lower angle of the eye to the upper edge of the ear. Its throat is light with dark spots forming a reticulated pattern. Like all members of the prasinus-group, with 22‚Äì23 more or less symmetrical blue rings, the tail is prehensile and about 1.95 times as long as the snout-vent length (SVL). Male blue-spotted monitors reach a larger maximum size than female blue-spotted monitors, and they can be distinguished by the comparatively broader temporal region and distinct hemipenal bulges posterolateral to the cloaca. Adult male blue-spotted monitors may reach in total length, and female blue-spotted monitors are about shorter than the male blue-spotted monitors, making V. macraei the largest known species of the V. prasinus complex. Behavior and diet This species is diurnal and arboreal thus it avoids predators by fleeing up a tree and keeping the trunk between itself and the intruder, as many anoles do. Currently no studies have been published on the matter, however the diet of V. macraei is likely primarily made up of (in order) stick insects, orthopterans (grasshoppers, katydids and crickets), moths, beetles, smaller lizards, small eggs, and the occasional berry. History As recently as a decade ago, only five species comprised the tree monitor group: Varanus prasinus, V. beccarii, V. bogerti, V. keithhornei, and V. telenesetes. In the early years of the 21st century, that number has been supplemented with the discoveries and naming of V. macraei, V. boehmei, and V. reisingeri. The considerable similarity among these species made them difficult to differentiate. Some individuals of the decidedly green V. prasinus have very little yellow pigmentation, and thus appear pale blue. Varanus reisingeri can very well be described as looking like V. prasinus without blue pigmentation. While there are very few reports ‚Äî and no specific field studies ‚Äî relating to the natural history of any of the tree monitors, there is a considerable body of knowledge available for the green tree monitor (V. prasinus) and the black tree monitor (V. beccarii), two of the species that have been very successfully maintained and bred in captivity for more than two decades. Consequently, several herpetoculturists and at least two zoos have now kept and bred the blue-spotted monitor (V. macraei).

It emerges as the critical theory of modernism, which argues the antiquity and la longue dur√©e of nation while modernists believe nation's purely modern appearance. John A. Armstrong, Anthony D. Smith and John Hutchinson are regarded as important theorists of ethnosymbolism. The term was first used as \\"ethno-symbolist approach\\" in an article by Daniele Conversi, Smith's former student at the London School of Economics. However, Conversi was slightly critical, arguing: \\"if we focus exclusively on the power of the past and its symbols, we miss two other key features of nationalism: first, its relationship with political power, and particularly with the state; second, its crucial border-generating function\\".  Important theorists and theories  = John A. Armstrong = Armstrong's contribution to ethnosymbolism is his myth-symbol complexes in Nations before Nationalism published in 1982, which firstly underlined the significance of la longue dur√©e according to Anthony D. Smith. Armstrong believes that ethnic consciousness has existed for long, whose traces could even be found in ancient civilisations such as Egypt, and nationalism is merely \\"the final stage of a larger cycle of ethnic consciousness reaching back to the earliest forms of collective organization\\". Therefore, similar to the longue dur√©e of Annales School, formation of ethnic identity should be examined in time dimensions of many centuries. He emphasised the boundaries for human identity by adopting the social interaction model of Fredrik Barth and argues that \\"groups tend to define themselves not by reference to their own characteristics but by exclusion, that is, by comparison to 'strangers. In other words, the character of a group is never fixed, and in accordance with group member's individual perceptions the boundaries of identities vary. Hence, comparing to the objective group characteristics, the boundary mechanisms of distinguishing a particular group from others should be studied more. His conception of ethnic group defined by exclusion rules out any definitional way to distinguish ethnicity from other collective identity including religious and class identities, for which reason himself is more concerned with the shifting interactions among class, ethnic religious loyalties than with \\"compartmentalizing definitions\\". For Armstrong, \\"myth, symbol, communication and cluster of associated attitudinal factors are usually more persistent than purely material factors\\", which indicates his emphasis on the persistence of these symbolic boundary mechanisms. He further specified and analysed several factors that ensure such persistence. The first such factor, also the most general one, is ways of life and the experiences associated with them. There are two fundamentally different ways of life: the nomadic and the sedentary. The second factor is religion, exemplified by Christianity and Islam both of which gave birth to different civilisations and the myths/symbols. The third factor is city, whose effect upon ethnic identification 'requires examination of a host of factors ranging from the impact of town planning to the unifying of centrifugal effects of various legal codes, especially the L√ºbeck and Magdeburg law. The fourth factor is imperial polities' role, whose central question is \\"how could the intense consciousness of loyalty and identity established through face-to-face contact in the city-state transferred to the larger agglomerations of cities and countryside known as empires\\"? The Mesopotamian myth of the polity as a reflection of heavenly rule, being called mythomoteur by Armstrong, is exemplified as \\"myth transference for political purposes\\" since it was used as vehicle for incorporating city-state loyalties in a larger framework. The last factor is language. Uniquely, Armstrong concludes that \\"the significance of language for ethnic identity is highly contingent\\" in pre-modern era. Its significance relied on political and religious force and allegiances for centuries. Nonetheless, in his later works, he agrees with most modernists including Benedict Anderson and Eric Hobsbawm that national identity had been an invention, and the only remaining disagreement would be \\"over the antiquity of some inventions and the repertory of pre-existing group characteristics that inventors were able to draw upon\\". = Anthony D. Smith = Although a former student of Ernest Gellner, who is considered to represent modernism, Anthony D. Smith has perspectives of nationalism that differentiate him from his teacher. He is also the last contributor to the \\"LSE debate\\" on nationalism (named by Gellner). His central thesis is that \\"modern state cannot be understood without taking pre-existing ethnic components into account, the lack of which is likely to create a serious impediment to 'nation-building'.\\" Smith has suggested theorists to define key terms such as \\"nation\\" and \\"nationalism\\" beyond the theoretical limitation of both modernism and primordialism. In his opinion, the problem of modernism is mainly that modernists define nation as \\"modern nation\\" with characters of European nations of 18th and 19th centuries, making their definition Eurocentric and partial. Instead, he proposes an ideal-typical definition of the nation: \\"a named human population sharing an historic territory, common myths and historical memories, a mass, public culture, a common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members\\". He also introduces the important term ethnie, a French word meaning \\"ethnic group\\", which is used to describe the pre-modern ethnic communities and contains six main attributes: #a collective proper name #a myth of common ancestry #shared historical memories #one or more differentiating elements of common culture #an association with a specific \\"homeland\\" #a sense of solidarity for significant sectors of the population. These six attributes suggest that ethnie is \\"anything but primordial\\", for which reason that ethnie is formed and constructed. Its formation is with two patterns: coalescence and division. The former unites separate units, while the latter functions conversely. According to Smith's observation, there are four main mechanisms of ethnic self-renewal: #religious reform, exemplified with the history of Jews. #cultural borrowing, exemplified with encounter between Jewish and Greek cultures #popular participation, exemplified with the socio-religious popular movement of the Mazdakites in 5th-century Sassanid Persia undermining the foundations of the Sassanid state. #myths of ethnic election, the lack of which might be related to the diminishment of ethnic survival of Assyria, Phoenicia and the Philistines. In order to understand \\"why and how does the nation emerge?\\", Smith identifies two types of ethnic community: the lateral (aristocratic) and the vertical (demotic). In his more recent work, Smith has added the third route of nation formation: immigrant nations that consist of the fragments of other ethnies, such as the United States and Australia. = John Hutchinson = John Hutchinson was supervised by Smith while undertaking his PhD at the London School of Economics. His primary contribution to ethnosymbolism is the theory of cultural nationalism in the Dynamics of Cultural Nationalism (1987). He separates nationalism into political nationalism and cultural nationalism, which are different, even competing conceptions of the nation, and \\"have sharply diverging political strategies\\". Political nationalists are essentially cosmopolitan rationalists whose conception of nation \\"looks forward ultimately to a common humanity transcending cultural differences\\". Although the fact that the world has been divided into multiple political communities has forced them to work within existing borders, political nationalists' objectives are to \\"secure a representative state for their community so that it might participate as an equal in the developing cosmopolitan rationalist civilization\\". Nationalism in most West European states after 18th century meets the criterion of political nationalism, which is also the nationalism that modernists including Eric Hobsbawm and Benedict Anderson refer to in their works. On the contrary, cultural nationalists believe that humanity is \\"infused with a creative force which endows all things with an individuality\\" similar to nature. They regard the state being accidental since a nation is essentially its distinctive civilisation which is \\"the product of its unique history, culture and geographical profile\\". Nations are organic entities and living personalities. In perspectives of cultural nationalists, nation is on the passions implanted by nature and history rather than \\"mere\\" consent or law. As the organic entity, conflict, generally between ageing traditionalists and the educated young, is not only inevitable for nation but also indispensable for nation's continuous renovation and regeneration. Such conclusion of features of cultural nationalism is based upon Hutchinson's observation of nationalism of late nineteenth century India and China, respectively represented by Swami Vivekananda and Liang Qichao. On the other hand, cultural nationalism hardly draws attention from theories of modernism. Not only has he challenged modernism in his earlier works, he has also engaged postmodernism in his more recent works, especially in Nations as Zones of Conflict (2005).

Violent Gang Is a Stain on a Proud Ethnic Community Series: The rise of a small street gang, Armenian Power, is causing a tragic cycle of fear and death. Los Angeles Times They are involved in drug trafficking, murder, assault, fraud, identity theft, illegal gambling, kidnapping, racketeering, robbery and extortion. They are believed to have around 5,500 members and hundreds of associates, according to the U.S. attorney‚Äôs office. They are also well known for their affiliation with the Mexican-American mafia. History According to a 1996 report by the Office of the California Attorney General, Armenian Power has strong ties to Russian organized crime. In the summer of 1988, two dozen gang members took over the parking lot of a mini-mall in East Hollywood and turned it into their headquarters. They intimidated patrons of the mall's restaurants and clothing stores, forcing the shop owners to hire some off-duty LAPD officers for security. By mid-1997 the Armenian Power gang was believed to be responsible for a dozen driveby murders.Rodriguez, Luis (2003). Hearts and Hands: Creating Community in Violent Times, p. 38. Seven Stories Press, AP leadership also maintains ties to Armenia and Russia and deals directly with high level Armenian/Russian organized crime figures. Gang activity has never been reported in East Coast, Midwestern, Northern or Southern Armenian-American communities primarily composed of Van (central) Armenians, Syrian-Armenians and Iraqi-Armenians. The unique ethnic composition of the Los Angeles area, which had a strong presence of many different gangs, played a major role in the creation of the Armenian Power gang. Though on the street-level Armenian Power may seem to be merely a loosely organized youth street gang, the street gang component is merely one aspect of the organization, with younger street gang members often serving as the enforcement arm or \\"soldiers\\" for a more organized Armenian-American criminal organization consisting of higher-up members. Armenian Power's status as a highly organized crime group rather than simply a street gang became apparent when Armenian-American gangsters were found to be involved in the 2010 Medicaid fraud case and the 2011 FBI-led Operation Power Outage. According to the official FBI website: \\"The Southern California crime ring called Armenian Power may look like a traditional street gang‚Äîmembers identify themselves with tattoos and gang clothing‚Äîbut the group is really an international organized crime enterprise whose illegal activities allegedly range from bank fraud and identity theft to violent extortion and kidnapping.\\" On November 4, 2019, Armenian Power \\"shot caller\\" Mher Darbinyan was sentenced to a 32-year prison term. He faces deportation to Armenia once he is released. = Mexican-Armenian conflict = Armenian Power has had a history of conflict with Sure√±o gangs, which are controlled by the Mexican Mafia, in the past, but the war is thought to have ended in recent years.Ryan, Harriet (September 19, 2003).

Gang Violence Claimed Man Who Tried to Change; Crime: The conviction of his killer closes the final chapter in the story of a former Armenian Power leader who was slain in inter-ethnic strife. Los Angeles Times In 2000, the murder of a 17-year-old Mexican- American outside of Hoover High School in Glendale by Armenian Power members sparked dialogue to find ways to help end the war between the gangs.Rodriguez, Luis (2003).

Today the Mexican Mafia prison gang collects protection money from Armenian Power, which has added the number 13 to its name as a sign of loyalty. The two gangs, and the Sure√±os, now work together to both control and extort protection money from criminal activities in the Los Angeles area. Operation Power Outage On February 16, 2011 during Operation Power Outage over 900 federal and local law enforcement authorities arrested nearly 100 people allegedly involved in Armenian organized crime in the Los Angeles area. Much of the crime was white collar in nature, including identity theft crimes such as credit card skimming.Blankstein, Andrew (February 16, 2011). Nearly 100 charged, dozens arrested in operation targeting Armenian organized crime. Los Angeles TimesStaff report (February 16, 2011). Arrests of Armenian Group in Calif.

Controversy In August 2014, the Tricycle Theatre informed the UK Jewish Film Festival (UKJFF) that it could not host the Festival in 2014 (as it had done for the previous eight years) if the Festival continued to pursue a ¬£1,400 grant it had sought from the Israeli Embassy in London. The theatre offered to make up the loss itself but the Festival's then chairman Stephen Margolis dismissed this offer as a \\"publicity stunt\\", saying that the Tricycle's artistic director Indhu Rubasingham had also demanded to scrutinise the list of films to be shown. The decision led to accusations of anti-semitism and The Jewish Chronicle described the decision as \\"open racism\\". Rubasingham drew attention to her own and the Tricycle's record, adding, \\"I am not anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli\\". Nick Cohen, writing in The Spectator, accused the Tricycle of inconsistency, as other groups' or events' funding had not, he claimed, previously been examined in this way. Cohen also pointed out that the Tricycle itself accepted Arts Council funding during times that the UK was actively involved in military conflicts. In an editorial, The Guardian said that the Tricycle had made \\"a bad error of judgment\\". Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport was reported as saying that the theatre had been \\"misguided\\" in demanding the festival drop its sponsorship by the Israeli Embassy. Theatre directors Nicholas Hytner and Richard Eyre both supported the Tricycle's position and deplored those who had misrepresented that position. Hytner also said \\"Rubasingham and the Tricycle board could not have made clearer their commitment to Jewish culture ... It is entirely understandable that they felt obliged to insist that no government agency should sponsor the festival. The Tricycle ... has a clear responsibility to make no statement about the dispute that is behind the current conflict. It greatly saddens me that the UKJFF have unwisely politicised a celebration of Jewish culture\\". However, in a joint statement on 15 August, the UKJFF and Tricycle Theatre said: \\"Some weeks ago the UKJFF fell out, very publicly, with the Tricycle over a condition imposed by the Tricycle regarding funding. This provoked considerable public upset. Both organisations have come together to end that. Following lengthy discussions between the Tricycle and UKJFF, the Tricycle has now withdrawn its objection and invited back the UK Jewish Film Festival on the same terms as in previous years with no restrictions on funding from the Embassy of Israel in London.\\" The 2014 festival did not take place at the theatre, but the Tricycle had hoped to hold some UKJFF-related events later in the year. In May 2015 the Tricycle Theatre's chair, Jonathan Levy, issued an apology in an article published in The Jewish Chronicle, saying that the theatre had taken the wrong decision when it had asked UKJFF to return to the Israeli Embassy the ¬£1,400 funding it had received and that it was now seeking ways to rebuild mutual trust with the Jewish community. = 2015 = The 19th UK Jewish Film Festival was the first to be overseen by UK Jewish Film's new chief executive Michael Etherton, and ran from 7 to 22 November 2015 with 127 screenings of 84 films in London, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Nottingham.

Background  With the starting point of the smart metering initiative driven by the European Union, several German multi utilities companies (public utility offering more than only one type of supply like electricity, gas, water and district heat) joined and asked international manufacturers of revenue meters to create a common standard. The goal was to have meters with standardized communication interfaces and systems in the future. On the side of meter manufacturers there were mainly the members of the technical associations in Germany FIGAWA (German Association for Gas and Water) and ZVEI (German Electrical and Electronics Industry Association), but also several other internationally operating companies joined to create a bundle of common definitions and specifications based on the European Meter-Bus standard (EN 13757) as well as the Dutch NTA 8130.  The specification  Concerning the created Open Metering System Specification (OMS specification or OMSS) a subset out of the existing Meter- Bus standard series (EN 13757) was selected, definitions were made where selections or ambiguities were possible, to streamline the interpretation by different producers. In addition the encryption using the AES 128 standard has been introduced as a requirement for all wireless and Power-line communication based communication channels.  Standardization  The outcoming results were entered in the European standardization organization and is currently being discussed as an adoption or extension of EN 13757.

The conference was held on May 13-16, 1999 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and was organized by the National Indian Telecommunications Institute (NITI), a private non-profit organization that employs advanced technology to serve American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians in the areas of education, economic development, language and cultural preservation, tribal policy issues and self-determination.

For most of its history Teffont Magna was a chapelry of neighbouring Dinton. In 1934 it was combined with the parish of Teffont Evias, just to the south, to form a united Teffont parish. Location Teffont Magna lies west of Dinton and west of Wilton. The parish extends north onto the chalk downs that separate the valleys of the Nadder and Wylye. The village is between Chilmark and Dinton on the B3089 Hindon to Barford St Martin road, in the valley of a stream which rises just to the north and flows south through Teffont Evias to join the Nadder. History The north boundary of the ancient parish, and hence also of the modern parish, is a prehistoric linear earthwork called Grim's Ditch. A hillfort of uncertain age known as Wick Ball Camp stands on a hilltop in the east of the parish, straddling the boundary with Dinton. There is a Roman site southwest of the village. The 15th-century cartulary of Shaftesbury Abbey includes two charters which refer to land in \\"Teffont\\". The first is dated 860, and in it √Üthelbald grants fourteen cassati (hides) to a thegn named Osmund. In the second, of 964, King Edgar granted five cassati to the thegn Sigestan. As Shaftesbury Abbey owned the manor of Teffont Magna by the time of the Norman Conquest, the charters may refer to parts of it. There is no mention of Teffont Magna in the Domesday Book, where it may be included under Dinton, another of the Abbey's manors. The ancient parish formed part of the Warminster hundred of Wiltshire. After the Dissolution, Teffont Magna was acquired with Dinton by William Herbert, who later became Earl of Pembroke. It remained with his successors as Earls of Pembroke until 1919, when it was sold to Lord Bledisloe. In 1950 his younger son, Charles Hiley Bathurst, sold the estate to John Jacob Astor, who a year later broke the estate up by selling it in several lots. Fitz House, the largest in the village, was built in the mid-17th century in dressed limestone and with mullioned windows; a left wing was added in 1700 and converted from a wool store to living accommodation in the 1920s. Close to the house is a 15th- century thatched barn. According to Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870‚Äì1872): A small school was built in the village around the 1870s, and in 1893 the average attendance was 52. After it was closed in 1936, children attended schools in Dinton or Wilton; the building remains in use as the village hall. The civil parishes of Teffont Magna and Teffont Evias were combined in 1934 to form Teffont parish. The population of Teffont Magna in 1931 had been 172. A detailed history of the parish was published in 1965 by the Wiltshire Victoria County History (Volume VIII). An etching of Teffont Magna by John Piper was released in an edition of seventy prints in 1988.Architects' Journal, vol. 193 (Architectural Press, 1991), p. 68 Church St Edward's Church The 13th century Church of England church was for much of its existence a chapel of ease of Dinton, and thus escaped Victorian restoration and is substantially original. In rubble stone with dressed limestone, the building has a simple plan, with a four-bay nave and chancel under one roof; the 14th-century south porch has its original roof timbers. There is no tower, instead a niche in the west gable houses two bells. One of the bells, thought to date from the 13th century, became cracked and was moved into the church in 1930; in 1947 its replacement was installed and the second bell was recast. Inside are flagstone floors and a wooden chancel screen from the early 16th century. The cylindrical font is from the 12th century, and set into a wall is a fragment of a Saxon cross with fine carving. Wiltshire archaeological and natural history magazine, volume 48 (1939), p. vi In 1965 no dedication was recorded for the church, and in that year it was named St Edward's, for Edward the Martyr, king and saint.Teffont Magna church at teffont.com. Retrieved 16 November 2010. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1966. As a chapel of ease for St Mary's at Dinton ‚Äì miles away as the crow flies ‚Äì Teffont Magna was always served by the vicar of Dinton or his curate. In 1922 it was detached from Dinton and united with Teffont Evias to form the parish of Teffont Evias with Teffont Magna. The benefice was held in plurality with Dinton from 1952. In 1979 the benefice became part of a group ministry, today called the Nadder Valley team and covering fourteen parishes with sixteen churches. The burial ground on the other side of the lane was consecrated in 1925. The parish registers are in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre for the following dates: christenings 1852‚Äì1991 and marriages 1852‚Äì1992. Earlier records are with those of Dinton.Teffont Magna at genuki.org.uk. Retrieved 16 November 2010. Governance Teffont Magna is now part of the parish of Teffont, which has a parish council and is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for almost all significant local government functions. It falls within the South West Wiltshire parliamentary constituency and the serving Member of Parliament is Andrew Murrison. Notable people On 25 October 1854, in the Crimean War, Charles Wiltshire Short of Teffont Magna took part in the Charge of the Light Brigade.Roy Dutton, Forgotten Heroes: the Charge of the Light Brigade, p. 187 In 1856 Harry Fidler was born here to a local farmer, but he took to painting and returned to have a studio here at an old Methodist Church.

Gold by the Inch. New York: Grove, 1998. Print.  Plot  The novel is split into three sections. = Part 1 = The narrator is in Thailand visiting his younger brother, Luk, who works there as an architect. Thailand is the birthplace of the narrator's mother. He ‚Äòfalls in love‚Äô with Thong, a Thai prostitute, during his visit. The book tracks the narrator's relationship with Thong. This relationship at first seems to be somewhat mutual but soon is clearly shown to be driven by money as Thong accepts every monetary gift doled out by the narrator. Thong eventually invites the narrator to live with him and his family instead of spending on expensive hotel rooms every night and it becomes evident that Thong is actually from a relatively wealthy family. = Part 2 = The narrator now leaves Thailand to visit family in Malaysia (Penang), the country in which his father was born. In this section, more information concerning the narrator's childhood and family is revealed. For instance, the narrator's father had a terrible relationship with his family in Malaysia as well as his own son and wife, whom he later left for an American woman. In this section, stories from the narrator's past are revealed and we learn that the narrator only began this journey because at home he just recently witnessed his father's death and the end of his relationship with boyfriend, Jim. His father had been living in Honolulu with wife and was near to death when the narrator decided it was okay to visit him. The narrator dated Jim in New York and the two's relationship was based on Jim's economic power and the narrator's aesthetic value. The relationship ended over Jim's inability to quit using drugs. Back in Malaysia, the narrator tours the city with his auntie. The narrator also neglects to tell the Luk, his mother, or his father's family in Malaysia that Ba, the narrator's father, has died. While in Malaysia, the narrator also devotedly thinks about Thong, whom he very much misses and completely ends his relationship with Jim by first reporting him to the authorities as a drug smuggler and then sending him a postcard that reads, ‚ÄòKeep everything‚Äô (89). The narrator also spends some time trying to get a photograph of his grandmother whose death is surrounded by numerous stories. Post a conversation with his grandmother's spirit, the narrator finally decides his trip is completed and he is ready to return to Thong in Thailand. = Part 3 = The narrator makes a point of not contacting Thong right away until he sees him one night past weekend walk into the same bar the narrator is at with three friends. Thong's commitment to the narrator is suspect. The narrator moves into Thong's house but he sleeps separately from Thong on an entirely different floor. In general, Thong becomes more and more distant and less and less affectionate. As jealousy takes over the narrator, he spirals into a stronger and stronger drug addiction. At some point, the narrator and Thong bump into each other at a bar and through the translation of another friend, Thong breaks up with the narrator. Eventually, the narrator moves out of Thong's house. Luk and friends try to help the narrator recover from his breakup. In the end, the narrator realizes that in the end, he is just an American doing things in Thailand he would be unable to do back home. Though he tries to play this off as something that makes him invincible, in the end the narrator seems to realize that his trip is done, and he needs to return home though where home is the book does not specify.  Characters  = Narrator = Nameless protagonist born in Penang, Malaysia that grew up in New York and travels to Thailand and Malaysia after visiting his dying father in Honolulu. = Thong = A male prostitute who sparks the narrator's love interest. While the narrator appears at times to have legitimate feelings for him, Thong makes it explicitly clear to him several times that he is interested in the narrators personal finances. = Jim = The narrator's previous lover. No real attachment to him, but the narrator does admit he feels ‚Äúsafe‚Äù with him. = Luk = The narrator's brother who has lived away from him for a long time. He presents a more authentic ‚ÄúThai- ness‚Äù than the narrator.  Themes  = IdentitySohn, Stephen. \\"\\"Valuing\\" Transnational Queerness Politicized Bodies and Commodified Desires in Asian American Literature.\\" Transnational Asian American Literature: Sites and Transits. Philadelphia, PA: Temple UP, 2006. Print. = The narrator never identifies himself as gay, yet he practices all of the social applications for being a homosexual (i.e., having sex only with men). Then again, being ‚Äúgay‚Äù in a Thai sense does not necessarily mean the same as being a homosexual, as well as the issues with being a Kathoey and what is classified as a closet homosexual in the Western sense. =Authenticity= Language is a great indicator of authenticity. Dialect, regional tones, and ‚Äúproper use‚Äù are all used to signify class characteristics like class, race, social status, and education. For example, when the narrator arrives in Malaysia, his family asks if he can still speak, implying that language is his connection to his culture and roots. Food is another signifier that is briefly mentioned throughout the novel. =Nostalgia= The lack of an ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô space in each of the regions (Thailand, Malaysia) that he visits despite familial and personal ties complicates the narrator's search for identity in his homeland. The narrator's tie to each of his various ethnic backgrounds often becomes devalued by others due to language, cultural, and social barriers. The narrator attempts to search for a homeland and feels the emotion and nostalgia for a place that may or may not exist. Moreover, these feelings are complicated by his sexuality (‚Äúgay‚Äù in a Westernized sense compared to its Thai connotations), Thai sex culture, barriers of language (English, Thai, Malaysian) and Americanization. The summation of these attributes create a nostalgic feeling for an identity and homeland that is both distinctly unique yet not clearly defined. This is further complicated by the lack of any other individual, including any family members with similar identity issues. For example, his one brother, Luk, embraces a Thai identity and lives in Thailand as an architect.  Settings and significance  ''' New York - The narrator's ‚Äúactual‚Äù home, where the narrator lived with this mother growing up and where he previously lived with Jim. Malaysia - Where the narrator's father emigrated and where the narrator's paternal family still lives. Thailand - Where the narrator's mother and father are ethnically from, as well as where his brother currently lives. Honolulu, Hawaii - Where the narrator's father took his last residence with his current wife and eventually died.  Close readings of selected pages/passages  = ‚Äò'King Rubber‚Äô' = The narrator who grew up in New York and speaks English, as his primary language allows a Dutch man whose English is actually poor compared to the narrator's, to completely orientalize him. Based on the narrator's physical features and fumbling for English words, the Dutch man assumes that the narrator is a Thai prostitute and invites him to his hotel room. Before partaking in sexual intercourse, the Dutch man pulls out a pair of rubber shorts and shirt. This is significant, because in Thai history, rubber trees were introduced by the British since the soil in Thailand was fertile and suitable for growing rubber. However, rubber tree plantations had devastating environmental effects due to the use of arsenic trioxide, a carcinogenic compound, as well as abstract adverse health effects.

Due to Missouri House redistricting following the 2010 U.S. Census the 2nd district will be divided into two newly numbered districts. Representative Wyatt had originally filed to run for the 3rd district, which includes most of his former 2nd district territory. However, in early April 2012 he announced his intention to withdraw once a suitable Republican replacement could be named. Wyatt stated his withdraw was prompted by his acceptance into a marine biology program at the University of Hawaii, and his desire to take full advantage of his veterans education benefits. In the November general election Republican Nate Walker defeated Democrat Rebecca McClanahan, Wyatt's opponent in 2010, to win the 3rd district seat and succeed Wyatt. Personal life Zachary Wyatt was born October 7, 1984 in Kirksville, Missouri to parents Randall \\"Randy\\" Wyatt and Frances \\"Fran\\" Wyatt (n√©e Quint). He has one sibling, older brother Nicholas Wyatt, a U.S. Navy veteran. Raised in rural western Adair county, Wyatt graduated from Adair County R-1 High School in Novinger, Missouri in 2003. Following graduation he enlisted in the United States Air Force, serving until March 2010. While in the USAF, Wyatt earned an Associate of Arts degree in information technology from the Community College of the Air Force, as well as an Associate of Arts degree in Russian language and a Chechen translating certificate from the Defense Language Institute. While in the Air Force Wyatt also served as an airborne Russian/Chechen/Ukrainian linguist on RC-135 and C-130 aircraft monitoring communications. Political life Zachary Wyatt developed an interest in politics as a teen, an interest that was further enhanced when he had the opportunity to serve as a legislative intern for Missouri United States Senator Christopher \\"Kit\\" Bond in 2007. According to Wyatt: \\"It was at this time I first realized my call in life was to serve Missouri through politics.\\" Despite not having run for or held public office before, Wyatt declared his candidacy for Missouri's 2nd District State Representative. In an election upset, Wyatt defeated two-term incumbent Representative Rebecca McClanahan by a margin of 60.6% to 39.4% In addition to the state legislature, Wyatt was also elected president of Novinger Renewal in 2010. Novinger Renewal is a community betterment group working for the historic preservation and revitalization of Novinger, Missouri.Novinger Renewal newsletter, Summer 2010 edition Legislative Assignments Representative Wyatt serves on the Veterans, International Trade and Job Creation, Special Standing Committee on Renewable Energy, and Agri-Business committees. Wyatt also serves as vice- chair of the Rural Communities Development Committee. Summer 2011, Representative Wyatt was appointed to the Joint Committee on Urban Agriculture. He also will serve on the Missouri Arts Trust Board. =2011 Legislative Session= Representative Wyatt sponsored 14 pieces of legislation in the session. The bills dealt with economic development, veterans, education, and lower taxes. Three of the bills were signed into law. =2012 Legislative session= Among the bills introduced during the session by Representative Wyatt were legislation to establish renewable energy in Missouri state parks, changes allowing more freedom in living arrangements for the developmentally disabled, and a constitutional amendment altering the state's judicial commission. Wyatt vs. Judge Steele One key piece of legislation was HR 333 sponsored by Representative Wyatt. The resolution called for the impeachment of Missouri Circuit Judge Russel E. Steele, the first such action in Missouri since 1968. The impeachment is based on allegations of possible judicial misconduct, willful neglect of duties as a jurist, and official corruption. The resolution received bipartisan support, being co-sponsored by Representatives Andrew Koenig (R), Paul Curtman (R), and Sylvester Taylor (D). In response to HR 333, Steele issued a press release stating \\"I trust that the media and the people will see this effort for what it truly is, politics at its worst\\" and that the Missouri Commission on the Retirement, Removal, and Discipline of Judges, as well as an Adair County grand jury, had already investigated the charges in 2006. The resolution was forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee but no further action was taken. \\"Don't Say Gay\\" bill In April and May 2012 Representative Wyatt expressed deep opposition to Missouri House Bill 2051, commonly known as the \\"Don't Say Gay\\" bill. The bill would put strict limits on the discussion of sexual orientation in Missouri schools, limiting it only to classes on health and sexual reproduction. The bill gained nationwide attention from various news outlets and The Colbert Report. On May 2, 2012 Wyatt held a press conference at the Missouri State Capitol outlining his opposition. During the course of the event he read a statement announcing that he was gay. The revelation meant that Wyatt is the only currently-serving gay Republican legislator in the United States, something addressed in a May 3, 2012 interview on the MSNBC program The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. Asked by O'Donnell why he was a Republican, considering the party's stance on LGBT issues Wyatt replied \\"I'm not a one-issue person\\" and that he is a firm believer in a balanced budget and small government.

Outside of Myanmar his work has been exhibited, often in solo shows, in Japan, the Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, Australia, New York City, the Republic of Singapore. Life Lun Gywe was born in Yangon, Myanmar on 24 October 1930, and was raised by his mother after his father died when he was five months old. From an early age he spent much of his time drawing. He studied under Thet Win, Chit Maung, San Win, Thein Han (painter) and Ngwe Gaing, and graduated from the Art Institute of Teacher's Training in 1954. He was an instructor at the State School of Fine Arts, Yangon (1958‚Äì1979) and principal of this school (1977‚Äì1979). He also taught at the Fine Art association the University of Rangoon (1960‚Äì1979). He studied in China in 1964, and was awarded a fellowship in art restoration to East Germany in 1971. His year-long stay in China had a strong influence, and he incorporated the Chinese brush and ink techniques into his oils and watercolors. The course in east Germany let him study European masters in East Berlin, Dresden and Potsdam and confirmed his love of impressionism. However, his greatest influence has probably been Thein Han, under whom he studied and with whom he retained a close relationship in his later life. Work Lun Gywe has been described as the greatest living Burmese painter. Lun Gywe began painting in a realistic and naturalistic vein, influenced by the major painters of the Rangoon School, Ba Nyan, Ngwe Gaing, San Win, and Thein Han who was his painting master. Over time, his works became more impressionistic and some of the works today might be called expressionistic. His exposure to rapidly executed Chinese ink and watercolor painting during his trip to China seems to have influenced his impressionistic work as he paints quickly and he is extremely prolific. His impressionistic work has been called \\"the action of impressionism\\". Of his Impressionist style, he has said, \\"I paint according to my emotions, drawing inspiration from smell and textures, light and shadow\\" An important part of his work focuses on the female form, his favourite subject. A strong believer in Buddhism, his work is unified by his devotion to the principles embodied in that religion of order, harmony, stability and grace. He has said \\"I find inspiration in calmness. I cannot create a good painting when in an unsettled frame of mind. I often meditate before I start a painting\\".

Meanwhile, Barney has found a disc he calls \\"Robin Sparkles 3\\", which contains Space Teens, a variety series involving two Canadian teenagers, Robin Sparkles and Jessica Glitter (Nicole Scherzinger), using math to solve crimes presented by Alan Thicke. The group claim that much of the Space Teens dialogue is laden with innuendo, which Robin denies. When conversation turns to why the group has never met Jessica if she and Robin were such good friends, Robin abruptly reveals that she has not spoken to Jessica in five years and attempts to drop the subject. When Robin leaves the apartment, Ted discovers a Christmas card Jessica sent to Robin with a picture of Jessica's baby. Ted speculates that Robin dumped Jessica as a friend when Jessica got pregnant, which upsets Lily, who fears that Robin will do the same to her. When Lily continues to talk about having a baby, Robin becomes fed up with her and the two of them break up, which upsets Marshall. Marshall takes Lily to see Jessica, who works as the organist for the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Jessica reveals that it was she who stopped being friends with Robin, not the other way around, because motherhood meant she no longer had the time to maintain their friendship. Jessica has considered getting back in touch with Robin, but never had the courage to try. Lily finds Robin at The Hoser Hut and they reconcile; Robin reveals that she has been afraid that Lily will abandon her once she becomes pregnant like Jessica did, while Lily promises not to talk about babies so much. Jessica, who has come to the Hoser Hut as well, sings the Beaver Song from Space Teens and Robin joins her, rekindling their friendship. Meanwhile, Robin and Jessica's estrangement prompts Ted to contact his old high school friend Punchy, who appears in New York.

Lumen is introduced in the third episode (\\"Practically Perfect\\") as a survivor of rapist-serial killer Boyd Fowler. She remains for the rest of the season, and leaves following the season 5 finale, \\"The Big One\\". In season 5, episode 5, \\"First Blood\\", Lumen is revealed to have been beaten and gang raped by a group of men, including Boyd Fowler. She witnesses Dexter Morgan kill Fowler, and thus becomes a key player in Dexter's life. Dexter rescues her, but initially thinks he has no choice but to kill her in order to eliminate a witness. He eventually decides to spare her life, however. To earn Lumen's trust, Dexter shows her the fate of Fowler's dead victims, tells her he saved her from the same fate, and confides his wife Rita was murdered by someone like Fowler. Lumen asks Dexter to help her seek revenge against her abusers, but he initially refuses. However, after Lumen continues on her own and targets the wrong suspect, Dexter teaches her the importance of knowing a person is guilty before killing him. He entreats her to leave Miami; she agrees at first, but decides to stay after a pat-down at the airport brings back memories of her abuse. She goes out on her own and shoots one of her attackers, but panics, not knowing what to do with his body; she calls Dexter, who reluctantly helps her cover up the murder. That night, she tells him that killing the man brought her a sense of peace that she knows will not last; she believes she will have to kill all of her attackers to get over her abuse for good. Dexter realizes that she harbors a \\"Dark Passenger\\" much like his and agrees to help, in part to find his own closure following Rita's murder. The two then systematically hunt down and kill Lumen's abusers, and in the process become lovers. Lumen leaves Dexter in the season finale, however, after realizing she no longer feels the need to kill. Lumen exited the show following the events of \\"The Big One\\". Development Lumen was created by executive producer Clyde Phillips for the fifth season of Dexter. Lumen is regularly portrayed by actress Julia Stiles. She originally signed on to appear in ten episodes of the series. In casting the role, producers were looking for someone with a vulnerable side. It was confirmed shortly before production that Stiles was in the final stages of appearance negotiations for a major role in the fifth season of Dexter. Showtime confirmed on June 7, 2010 that Stiles would appear on the show. They originally gave this character description: \\"She'll play a \\"mysterious young woman who forms a unique relationship\\" with the titular character, played by Golden Globe and SAG-winning actor Michael C. Hall.\\" The fifth season finale, \\"The Big One\\", marked the conclusion of the season-long subplot of Lumen seeking revenge against Jordan Chase (Jonny Lee Miller) and his accomplices, and marked the last in a string of regular guest appearances by Stiles and Miller. Stiles said at the start of her time on the series, she believed Lumen would likely be killed by the end of the season because most characters who have learned the truth about Dexter's double life have ended up dead. The actress said she never predicted that Lumen would break up with Dexter, and she found that scene difficult to perform, due to the level of intimacy the two characters had built up throughout the season. She prepared herself for the scene by focusing on the fact that Lumen was healed and the reality of the murders she committed with Dexter had sunk in. Stiles said she found Lumen's repudiation of Dexter particularly sad because she knew more about his darker side than anyone else, which meant her breakup was a rejection of him as a person. Arc Lumen is first seen in the series after witnessing Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) kill Boyd Fowler (Shawn Hatosy), a serial killer who had been keeping her captive. While it is extremely inconvenient for Dexter to leave a witness alive, Lumen does not fit Dexter's \\"code\\", and so he is morally obligated to keep her alive. He keeps her locked up in a secluded area until he figures out what to do. At first, Lumen is terrified of Dexter, believing he will kill her for witnessing his crime. She tries to escape, but Dexter catches her and shows her the bodies of Fowler's previous victims. He assures her that had he not killed Fowler, she would also have been murdered. Lumen then confides in Dexter and tells him that Fowler was not the only one to hurt her; it is ultimately revealed that she had been held captive for around a month, during which she was repeatedly raped and tortured by five men. Obsessed with revenge, she attempts to enlist Dexter's help to hunt down the remaining perpetrators. He is unwilling to help her at first, and urges her to leave Miami and return home. Dexter goes to Lumen's motel room and discovers she had been tracking down her abusers. He tries to spare her the experience of killing by hunting down a registered sex offender he believes to have been one of the perpetrators, but learns that the man is innocent and lets him go. Unable to bring herself to leave Miami, Lumen finds and shoots Dan Mendell (Sean O'Bryan), one of her rapists. She calls Dexter, who reluctantly helps track down the wounded Mendell and cautions her about killing the wrong person. Mendell pleads his innocence at first, but then calls his co-conspirators on Lumen's cell phone, confirming her suspicion and prompting Dexter to kill him. They later meet at Dexter's house, where Lumen reveals that Mendell's death brought her a fleeting sense of peace, and the only way to find that peace again is to kill her other tormentors. Dexter recognizes this need as her \\"Dark Passenger\\" and finally agrees to help her. Lumen turns up at the crime scene where Fowler's stocked and preserved victims are revealed from a traffic crash. There, she is spotted by Detective Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington), who asks disgraced cop Stan Liddy (Peter Weller) to look into her and Dexter. She identifies Cole Harmon (Chris Vance), head of security for self-help guru Jordan Chase (Jonny Lee Miller), as one of her rapists and saves Dexter from a surprise attack by Harmon. Setting up base at the hotel where Chase is giving his seminar, she helps Dexter set up and prepare for the kill. Harmon spots her in the lobby and chases her; Dexter barely manages to save her. Unable to extract any information, Lumen watches while Dexter kills him. While they dump the body, Liddy photographs them going out on Dexter's boat. After the police uncover DVDs of the men torturing and raping their victims, Dexter switches Lumen's DVD with a scratched and empty one. He then brings it to Lumen, who is afraid and ashamed at the prospect that the police and Dexter watched it. Dexter assures her that no one has seen it. Lumen then acknowledges that she knows what a risk he is taking by being with her, before tearfully telling him that he has been her only way through this. She then forces herself to watch her own rape, as Dexter listens from another room, clearly disturbed by what he hears. Lumen proves instrumental in getting information from Emily Birch (Angela Bettis), the first victim of Chase's gang and only other known survivor. This leads them to Alex Tilden (Scott Grimes), the first target. Tilden becomes Lumen's first victim, as Dexter allows her to deliver the killing blow at her request. Afterward, they return to Dexter's apartment, where they sleep together. As they lay in each other's arms, Dexter reflects that she is the first person to truly see him for who he is and accept him for it. As Lumen and Dexter begin to plan how they will capture Chase, they realize they are being watched. Once Dexter determines that they are under police surveillance, he attempts to convince Lumen to leave Miami for her own safety. However, Lumen refuses to abandon him, and Dexter ultimately admits that he wants her to stay. After receiving a distressed call from Emily, who says Chase contacted and threatened her, Lumen goes to Emily's house to reassure her, after unsuccessfully attempting to contact Dexter. This turns out to be a trap meant for Lumen and Dexter, however, and Chase kidnaps Lumen after murdering Emily. Dexter arrives later and can see that Lumen put up a fight, albeit unsuccessfully, and swears that he will not lose Lumen, too. After Dexter shows up to rescue Lumen, she finally kills Chase. After she and Dexter dispose of Chase's body, she admits to Dexter that she did not think they would be able to pull it off, describing it as a miracle. The next day, she regretfully tells Dexter she has to leave Miami; her \\"Dark Passenger\\" has left her, and she no longer feels the need to kill. She tells Dexter that she does not want to leave but has to, because his \\"Dark Passenger\\" will never leave him. Dexter ultimately understands, tells her she should not be sorry that her darkness has left her, and promises that he will carry her darkness as well as his own.  Reception  Many critics have responded well to Stiles's portrayal of the character -- so much so that her exit in \\"The Big One\\" was not well received. Matt Fowler of IGN said, \\"Having her leave was, unfortunately, inevitable and it meant that we had to sit through her explain the reason for her wanting to leave Dexter, which to us was a little plodding because we knew that it was all a way of getting her off the show when it felt so much more right, story-wise, for her character to want to stay. No, Dexter and Lumen's romance wasn't the true seller here, but it did fit within their vigilante partnership. And it seems like something that she wouldn't want to give up. I did appreciate Dexter's anger when he came to the sad realization that he was \\"forever broken, with an inner eternal dark flame.\\" For her performance, Stiles was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.

He has written numerous articles and produced various print and online publications on the topics of paranormal activity and psychic phenomena. Fleming has appeared on several paranormal-themed television programs and is best known as the IPA award-winning co-host of the popular series Dead Famous (2004‚Äì06) which is still in syndication internationally. Fleming was also the co-host and featured psychic on A&E;'s Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal TV show. Fleming frequently speaks at events, colleges and universities throughout the United States about paranormal topics. Early life and career Son of Chicago Blackhawks hockey player Reggie Fleming and Patricia Fleming, Chris Fleming was born in Chicago, Illinois, and is the oldest of two children. Raised Roman Catholic, he claims to have been experiencing spiritual and paranormal events since the age of four. He graduated in 1985 from William Fremd High School and 1989 from Beloit College in Wisconsin with a major in fine arts and minors in music and psychology with a specific concentration on Abnormal Psychology and Cognitive Psychology as well as Lateral Thinking and Creative Thinking. He played football in high school and college as receiver and running back. While studying fine art in his second year at Beloit, he was the first student to have his own art show during Sophomore year. He went on to have two separate art shows in his senior year due to his two different art styles; action painting reminiscent of Jackson Pollock and Pop Art influenced by Andy Warhol and Kenny Scharf. Two of his paintings (Titled Major Panic and ) were leased from the college for three years after his graduation, and one was used as a design for the class of '89's graduation pamphlet. One of his paintings is part of a permanent collection at the Wright Museum of Art in Beloit, Wisconsin. He is a member of the Alpha Zeta chapter of Sigma Chi fraternity and was voted historian from 1987‚Äì89. After college, Chris worked as a graphic designer from 1990‚Äì1994 at Pioneer Press in Barrington, IL and then as an art director at Advo, Inc 1995‚Äì1997, creating marketing campaigns for companies such as Venture, Pizza Hut, Burger King, and various local and chain stores throughout the Chicago area. He left the industry working as a freelance designer for his father's company Reg Fleming Industries, Inc., completing commissioned works, and painting murals at such establishments as Harry D's Restaurant in Deerfield, IL. While designing a corporate identity campaign for Sterling Mortgage, Inc in Chicago, IL he was coached by the president on how to be a loan officer. He quickly dived into the mortgage industry while maintaining his graphic design business Artform Graphics, Inc. Late one night, during conversations with other loan officers over pizza, a co-worker told a story about a ghost he had seen the night before. Peers and co-workers from different backgrounds and cultures also shared their personal stories. Listening to their compelling stories gave Chris an idea. After a trip to the local newsstand to pick up the latest copies of Fate (magazine) and UFO Magazine, he decided to use his graphic design abilities to publish his own periodical, Unknown Magazine. For the next four years he created and marketed the publication. Additionally, he spoke on radio and television all over the world about his own personal experiences and the other, amazing stories he featured in the magazine. His belief was that people all over the world were having extraordinary experiences that could not be fully explained. Chris continued working in the Mortgage industry of the United States from 1997-2010 as a loan officer for such companies as Pillar Financial, LLC in Palatine, IL and 1st American Mortgage in Schaumburg, IL, until resigning to concentrate more on his passion for paranormal research, travelling, speaking and book-writing. Chris continued participating in sports in local communities, playing men's softball and full contact Flag football. In the late '90s he coached and played on a full contact Flag football team he put together called The Raptors in Lake Zurich, IL. Over three years they went 34‚Äì5, losing the championship their first year. In their second year they went undefeated and in their third year, lost four games. An unfortunate, season- ending knee injury in his third year made him leave sports entirely. In the early '90s he began investigating with local ghost hunting groups at local haunts visiting such sites as the Red Lion Pub in Chicago, IL and Bachelor's Grove Cemetery in Midlothian, IL. Career as a medium In Fleming's publications, and in his television and public appearances, he claims that he has been having psychic and paranormal experiences since the age of four. He claims that their movement via thoughts and their telepathic abilities eventually became more of an interest of study rather than a fear. Over a period of time he claims he was in contact with a spirit named Henry that would warn him about other ghosts and entities as well as tell him things about the universe and people he knew. One conversation with Henry, in particular, stands out in Fleming's writings and lectures. Fleming claims that when he asked Henry if there was any life on planets in the Solar System, the response was on \\"Europa\\" and when asked what type of life, the response was, \\"Plant and bacteria.\\" Fleming claims to have conversed with Henry on the Ouija board from 1975‚Äì79 before Henry stopped interacting with Fleming. It wasn't until the late 1990s that Fleming overheard on CNN that scientists now believe there is life on Europa, one of planet Jupiter's moons. Fleming currently travels around to speak at events, colleges, and universities about various paranormal topics. Television and radio appearances In 1985, Fleming won a contest on WVVX 103.1 (now known as WPNA-FM ) for the Angus Young look-alike contest. He appeared on stage with AC/DC during their Who Made Who Tour at Poplar Creek Music Theater for the opening number \\"Who Made Who\\" and was selected the winner out of eight finalists. He appeared on the WVVX radio show with Scott Loftus afterwards and won a replica of Angus Young's Gibson SG guitar and their entire AC/DC catalogue. For three years(2004‚Äì2006), Fleming was the co-host of the popular TV show Dead Famous, where he joined co-host Gail Porter in search of celebrity ghosts across the United States. Their search took them not only to grave sites, but to some of the most reportedly haunted locations in the U.S. The show is still being broadcast in over 15 countries, including the Bravo network in Canada, Living TV in the UK, and The Biography Channel in the U.S. The three season span consisted of 26 episodes, two \\"Return\\" specials and three live episodes.Dead Famous (TV series) In 2007, Fleming made a guest appearance on Syfy's Ghost Hunters on Season 3, Episode 12, titled, \\"Manson Murders.\\" In addition to Psychic Kids, Dead Famous, and Ghost Hunters, Fleming has also made appearances on Born Country, Ghost Adventures, Larry King Live, Reality Obsessed, Scariest Places on Earth, Showbiz Tonight, The Haunted, Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, and Paranormal Challenge. In 2009, Flemming appeared as a guest investigator on the Ghost Adventures Halloween Special at the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, WV. In 2009, Fleming received the International Paranormal Acknowledgment (IPA) Awards for Best Spiritual/Psychic Medium Male TV Personality, Best National Spirit Medium Male, and Best International Paranormal TV Program winner: Dead Famous. Fleming documented his father, Reggie Fleming from 2007-2009 while his father attempted to recover from a stroke and heart attack. He resided at the Claremont Rehab and Living Center in Buffalo Grove, IL before he passed away on July 11, 2009. The videos can be seen on YouTube and have been seemingly praised by children and parents across the globe in their comments and responses. It has sparked Fleming to begin writing a book about his father and the last years they shared together. In 2011, Fleming made an appearance with the Paranormal Cops on an Italian TV series called Voyagers. They investigated the allegedly haunted building known as Casa Madrid in Chicago, IL and their voices were dubbed in Italian. In 2011, Fleming co-produced, along with Picture Shack Entertainment, a one-hour special called Raising The Dead about his shamanistic trip to Jamaica to learn the practice of Obeah and Myal. The special aired on Animal Planet in 2012. Unknown Magazine After months of being approached and hearing others talk about their own amazing experiences, Fleming chose to document these by creating his own publication called Unknown Magazine: Real Experiences of Unusual Phenomena, which ran from 1997 to 2001. As publisher, art director, writer, and editor, Fleming set out to create a magazine for people across the globe through which to share their first-hand encounters. In 1997, Fleming launched UnknownMagazine.com. In 2001, he stopped production of Unknown Magazine, but continued his work solely through the website. Fleming currently hosts and produces a monthly, online podcast, Spirit Talk. This podcast focuses on supernatural, paranormal, and spiritual topics with some of the world's most intriguing experts and pioneers.

He is well known for his large scale and rotating murals, which are often created live during public events. A graduate of the University of Arizona's art program, Joe Pagac traveled extensively worldwide honing his craft before becoming a fixture to the downtown Tucson arts scene. Almost as well known for his philanthropy as well as his artistic talents, Joe Pagac also is involved with many local organizations, including the Tucson Stray Canine Saviors and the Arizona Homeless Project - Breaking the Cycle.  Biography  Pagac studied art at both the University of Arizona and in Italy. He and Arielle Pagac were married on April 22, 2017, with a very public reception (everyone in Tucson was invited) afterward.  Rotating Concert Murals  Pagac is known for his large scale rotating concert murals which he paints live during public events. Using house paint, paint rollers and large brushes, Pagac paints finished works that are as large as 60 feet wide and 14 feet tall in as little as 8 hours. The murals generally advertise upcoming shows for touring bands but the artwork is designed by Pagac. The rotating murals have depicted a wide range of musical artists including, The Avett Brothers, Sonic Youth, George Thorogood and Cypress Hill. Because the murals advertise bands and are in highly visible locations, bands and graffiti artists began using some of the rotating murals to voice their concern over SB1070 after the law was passed in 2010. Pagac won Best Mural of 2010 awards in both Tucson and Phoenix. = Controversy = Pagac's promotional murals have come under fire for crossing the line between art advertising and in July 2010 the city of Tucson cited multiple revolving murals with sign code violations, stating that despite the artistic nature of the murals they promoted commercial products. A mural promoting the band The New Pornographers also stirred controversy over what is and is not appropriate to depict in public art when an offended mother filed a formal complaint and demanded the mural be removed due to the word \\"pornographers\\".  Non-Concert Murals  Pagac is a prolific muralist with many styles. His murals are especially visible in downtown Tucson, but they can be found in public (and private) locations around Tucson. As of June 2017, he had painted one of Tucson's largest murals. along Stone Avenue just north of Sixth Street. Some of his many other murals are shown by clicking the Labels link with his name on the Tucson Murals Project blog.

It is bounded on the north by the Cotton, Miller and Debenham Glaciers, and on the south by Victoria Valley and the Victoria Upper and Victoria Lower Glaciers. Named by the New Zealand Northern Survey Party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1956‚Äì58, which surveyed peaks in the range in 1957. Named for St. Johns College at Cambridge, England, with which several members of the British Antarctic Expedition (1910‚Äì13) were associated during the writing of their scientific reports, and in association with the adjacent Gonville and Caius Range. Kuivinen Ridge Kuivinen Ridge () is a transverse ridge extending southwest‚Äìnortheast across the Saint Johns Range between an unnamed glacier and the Ringer Glacier in Victoria Land. The ridge is long and rises to at Lanyon Peak. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 2005 after ice coring specialist Karl C. Kuivinen, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), 1974‚Äì2003; Field Operations Manager, Ross Ice Shelf Project Management Office, UNL, for the 1974‚Äì1978 season; Director, Polar Ice Coring Office, UNL, 1979-1989 and 1994‚Äì2001; 15 summer field seasons in Antarctica, between 1968 and 2000; and 24 summer field seasons in Greenland and Alaska between 1974‚Äì99. Lobeck Glacier Lobeck Glacier () is a glacier flowing northeast between Rutherford Ridge and Kuivinen Ridge in the Saint Johns Range of Victoria Land. About long, the glacier terminates upon rock cliffs overlooking Miller Glacier with insignificant, if any, flow entering it. Named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 2007 after the noted American geographer-geologist Armin K. Lobeck (1886-1958), Professor of Geology, Columbia University, from 1929 to 1954; He was the author of the textbook Geomorphology, widely used in training geomorphologists active in Antarctica. Rutherford Ridge Rutherford Ridge () is a transverse ridge, long, extending southwest to northeast across the Saint Johns Range between Wheeler Valley and Lobeck Glacier, Victoria Land. The ridge rises to in Mount Rowland. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 2007 after Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron of Nelson and Cambridge (1871-1937), a British physicist of New Zealand birth and winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1908.

It extends eastwards from Store Kongensgade and runs along the south side of the city's 17th-century fortress Kastellet and Churchillparken until it reaches the waterfront at Nordre Toldbod, just south of Langelinie, passing Amaliegade, Bredgade and Gr√∏nningen on the way. It marks the northern border of the Frederiksstaden district. It is best known as the address of the headquarters of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the largest shipping company in the world. In Danish media and daily usage, the street name is often used as a metonym for company's top management. History Esplanaden in 1790 Toldbodvej in 1872 C O Zeuthen: Toldbodvej Toldbodvej seen from Store Kongensgade in 1894: The Old Guard Hussars Barracks is the building to the left and the New Guard Hussars is the second building on the right. The street is located on Kastellet's former esplanade. Then known as Toldbodvej, literally \\"Custom House Road\\", was created as an access road to the Custom House, complementing Toldbodgade (\\"Custom House Street\\"), which came from the south along the water. In the 1780s, a tree-lined avenue, which quickly became a popular venue for promenades, was established between the end of Bredgade and the harbourfront a little to the north of Toldbodvej. A total of 3,000 trees from J√¶gersborg Dyrehave were planted in the grounds. It was around the same time that the first town houses began to appear on the south side of Toldbodvej. The tree-lined promenade largely disappeatrdd with the construction of the Port Authority Building (1868 ), the Royal Nautical Charts Archive (1873), and later the Resistance Museum. On 21 October 1885, council president Jacob Br√∏nnum Scavenius Estrup was the target of an attempted assassination outside No. 34. The unsuccessful assassin was Julius Rasmussen. In the 19th century, the Guard Hussars barracks were located at the western end of the street, first on its north side and later also in a building on its south side. It was demolished about 1900 and the site was built over in connection with the establishment of Gr√∏nningen. The masterplan for the area was adopted on 29 June 1903. The smaller streets in the area have names associated with the island of Bornholm. Toldbodvej was renamed Esplanaden in 1953. Notable buildings and residents Several of the buildings on the streets were designed by Andreas Hallander, including the two buildings on the corner of Amaliegade, No. 46 (1791) and No. 48 (1789), which are both listed. No. 6 is from 1785 and was designed by Andreas Kirkerup. No. 15 was completed in 1850 to a Neoclassical design by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. It now houses the A.P. M√∏ller and Wife Chastine Mc-Kinney M√∏ller Foundation. Bertelsen & Scheving completed a major renovation of the building in 2013. No. 19 originally housed the Royal Nautical Charts Archive as well as the Meteorological Institute. The building was designed by Vilhelm Petersen and built in 1872-1873.

The brand is also applied to a chain of supermarkets (Rustan's Supermarkets) established by the Rustan Group in 1970 which it owned until 2017. Rustan's Department Store is the flagship brand of the Rustan Group of Companies and has five major branches, three boutiques and an online shopping store rustans.com. Rustan's Department Store is considered the Philippines most prestigious retailer, carrying many of the world‚Äôs most famous upscale or luxury brands names, among them, Cartier, Mikimoto, Tiffany, Ermenegildo Zegna, Nina Ricci, Alfred Dunhill, Sonia Rykiel, and Estee Lauder. Rustan's was the first in the Philippine retailer to introduce a customer loyalty program, \\"Frequent Shoppers Plus\\" and a Wedding Registry.  History  Rustan's Department Store was established in 1952 by spouses, Bienvenido Tantoco, Sr. and Gliceria Rustia Tantoco. Rustan‚Äôs is a portmanteau of the couple's respective family names. Following a trip by the couple to Europe, Rustan's Department Store began as a set of goods displayed for sale in the couple's living room. Eventually, the Tantocos expanded the business to a small gift shop located in San Marcelino, Manila. In the following decade, it grew into a full-fledged department store. By the 1960s, Rustan's successfully introduced several international and haute couture brands to the Philippines for the first time including Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior. By 1970, the flagship store opened in Makati and the building became well-known for its blue external tile work for many decades and was sometimes referred to as the \\"Jewel box.\\" More brands followed including Lacoste, Lanvin, Gucci, and others. To facilitate this growth, Rustan Marketing Corporation was established in 1964 to introduce brands to the store and also undertake nationwide distribution of renowned brands. Today, this continues with a diversified portfolio of brands within beauty and personal care, apparel, watches, luggage, footwear, accessories, home, and lifestyle products. By 1973, it opened a second major store in Cubao, and a third in Cebu in 1981. During the 1990s, Rustan's grew to include a large store in upscale Shangri-la Plaza in Mandaluyong and another branch in Ayala Alabang. In parallel, the Tantoco family's reputation as leading retailers continued to grow as the couple's six children became involved in the daily business. In 1987, Stores Specialists Inc began operations to focus on the Philippine franchises for many of the world‚Äôs top brands. The brand portfolio consists of over 100 brands and over 600 stores; brands include Marks & Spencer, TWG Tea, The Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Zara, Tory Burch, and Calvin Klein. SSI is a publicly-listed company in the Philippine Stock Exchange. Other major businesses within the Rustan Group of Companies (RGOC) include Rustan Coffee which was one of the earliest operators of Starbucks outside the United States, Royal Duty Free Stores, ADORA - a luxury boutique department store, Sta. Elena Golf Course & Estate, and The Rustia-Tantoco Foundation. The Tantoco couple's six children have been involved in different areas of the business over the years. Today the chairman is eldest daughter Zenaida R. Tantoco, and the president is the eldest grandson Bienvenido V. Tantoco III. Rustan's Supermarket Rustan's Supermarkets was established in 1970. In 1998, Shopwise hypermarket was launched under Rustan Supercenters, Inc. (RSI). In 2006, the Rustan's supermarket chain (Rustan Supermarket, Inc.) was consolidated under RSI. In 2012, the Dairy Farm Group acquired 50% interest in RSI. By 2017, the Dairy Farm Group acquired full ownership of RSI. On March 23, 2018, the Dairy Farm Group sold RSI to Robinsons Retail Holdings, Inc. (RRHI) through a stock swap. After the sale, the Dairy Farm Group will own 18.25% of RRHI. At the time of the sale, RSI operated Rustan's Supermarket, Marketplace by Rustan's, Shopwise, Shopwise Express and Wellcome (Philippines). On April 11, 2018, Zenaida R. Tantoco, chairperson and CEO of the Rustan Group of Companies clarified that the Rustan's trademark and trade name was \\"never a part of the business transaction between RRHI and Dairy Farm Group, legally or otherwise.‚Äù Tantoco stated that Rustan Commercial Corporation (RCC) is the sole owner of the Rustan's trademark and trade name and the use by any third party requires the written consent of RCC. The statement clarified that after the buy-in of the Dairy Farm Group into RSI in 2012, RSI was granted use of the Rustan's trademark and trade name for a \\"limited period of five years commencing from the year 2012 and was terminated upon our written notice to the Dairy Farm Group on April 3, 2018.‚Äù The following day, RRHI issued a statement acknowledging the trademark license arrangement between RCC and RSI and should the trademark license of Rustan's be \\"validly terminated by RCC\\" such stores would be rebranded with \\"other premium brand alternatives.\\" The sale of RSI to RRHI was approved by the Philippine Competition Commission on August 17, 2018.

The U.S. Navy acquired Vara from her owner, Harold S. \\"Mike\\" Vanderbilt (1884-1970), on 7 October 1940. She was converted for naval service at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, classified as a submarine chaser (PC), and commissioned as USS PC-509 on 27 December 1941 at New York City. Operational history PC-509 was assigned to the Panama Canal Zone, where she was based throughout her naval career, and tasked with escorting convoys in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. She reached the Canal Zone on 2 February 1942. From February 1942 through April 1943, she escorted convoys according to a varied itinerary that included visits to Guantanamo Bay and Havana in Cuba; Jacksonville, Miami, and Key West in Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina. In May 1943, PC-509 began to concentrate on the Canal Zone-Guantanamo Bay convoy route exclusively. On 15 July 1943, she was classified as a coastal patrol yacht (PYc), renamed USS Valiant, and redesignated PYc-51. Between May 1943 and August 1944, she escorted seven convoys from the Panama Canal Zone to Guantanamo Bay; after the first six of these, she escorted another convoy back to the Canal Zone. Between convoys, she conducted routine patrols and participated in searches for German submarines, although there is no record of her ever seeing combat. Valiant escorted her seventh convoy from the Canal Zone safely into Guantanamo Bay on 25 August 1944. This time, instead of escorting a convoy back to the Canal Zone, she headed north for inactivation. She stopped briefly at Charleston on 28 August 1944 and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 31 August 1944. Decommissioning and disposal Valiant was decommissioned at Philadelphia sometime in September 1944 and turned over to the Commandant, 4th Naval District, for disposal.

In 1862 he returned to Warsaw, Poland, and further helped plan the uprising set for spring of 1863. He also pushed for the abolition of serfdom. The January Uprising When the January Uprising was set into motion, Padlewski was appointed general and took command of Polish insurgents in Warsaw and in the P≈Çock Governorate. He was a member of the Provisional National Government (Tymczasowy RzƒÖd Narodowy). He led his troops into the Puszczy Zagajnica forest of Kurpie where they skirmished with czarist forces near Myszyniec (9 March) and DrƒÖ≈ºd≈ºewo (12 March). It is in this area, near Radzan√≥w, the commander of the insurgents hid Zygmunt Padlewski with his division after Padlewski‚Äôs defeat at Myszyniec. Russian czarist troops, on 21 March, then moved into the area, and a battle near Radzan√≥w was fought which resulted in Padlewski losing the conflict with 50 of his insurgents killed in action or drowned while escaping. Capture and execution Padlewski's capture Padlewski was ordered to return to Warsaw after this defeat, and, while en route, on 21 April, he was stopped by a czarist Cossack sentry at the small village of Bo≈ºymin and ordered to show his passport. Unfortunately, he showed the sentry an incorrect document, which resulted in the sentry searching his carriage and finding incriminating documents, as well as his insurgent uniform. He was promptly arrested and placed in jail in P≈Çock. Padlewski, who was only 27 years old, was court marshaled by Russian authorities and sentenced to death by firing squad. On May 15, 1863, he was transported through the streets of P≈Çock to the execution place. The Polish population who lined the street watched and ‚Äúwomen threw bouquets of flowers from the windows, so that the whole road was strewn with roses and violets.‚Äù Polish Zygmunt Padlewski Remembrance Various monuments in Poland commemorate Padlewski. A school in P≈Çock has been named after him, as well as street in the city. There are several other schools and streets across Poland named in his honor.

Dr. Boulos and is one of 6 children (Frantz Boulos, Kathleen Boulos Weckering, Senator Rudolph Boulos, Marie Boulos, Dr. Carlo Boulos). Along with his brother Dr. Carlo Boulos, they attended and earned a medical degree in 1981 from the Port-au-Prince School of Medicine in Haiti. Reginald then furthered his education by graduating in 1982 with a Master of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the Tulane University School of Public Health in New Orleans. He conducted research with an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. He also holds certification from the MIT Sloan School of Management for senior executives. Business endeavors In 1996, Dr. Boulos left the medical practice to start a new career in business development. While representing his family's Boulos Investment Group, he became the Chairman of Intercontinental Bank S.A. (1996‚Äì1998) and negotiated a merger with Sogebank, one of Haiti's largest banks. In 2003, Dr. Boulos orchestrated the re- engineering of one of the oldest daily newspapers in Haiti, Le Nouveau Matin. From 2000 to 2010, Dr. Boulos created and developed Delimart, a chain of supermarkets, Autoplaza, a leading car dealership and Megamart, a membership food discount store.

It is a variation of the classic Dean ML, and this ‚Äúnewer‚Äù version was designed by Matt Heafy of the metal band, Trivium in 2008. Originally Matt Heafy first tried to create an original body style when he was approached by Dean Guitars, and he also attempted to make a modified version of the ML body style but he did not like what he came up with because he stated whatever he tried it just turned out to like something that has already been done before, so he picked this body design because he loves the ML body shape. And proof of this is that a lot of his guitars are the Dean ML body shape or altered versions of this guitar. For example, the Dean Razorback which he has in multiple colors like his white with gold trimmed USA Dean Razorback and a couple of Dimebag Darrell's signature models as well, like the USA Dean Dime Explosion. Specifications and features The Dean MKH, is a 24-3/4 inch scale ML body with a mahogany neck and body with a plain maple top, the neck on this guitar has had a completely original carve away made where the neck and body meets. (Matt Heafy and the Dean Woodshop guys cut back a lot on the heel of the neck to get the most amount of playability without hurting the tone of the guitar) This guitar also has a new feature for the ML series by adding two more frets to the neck, making it a twenty-four fret fretboard, instead of the original 22 fret fretboards on the MLs and most Dean Guitars for that matter. The fretboard is an ebony fretboard with twenty-four frets as just stated, and at the twelfth fret it has the Trivium \\"circle\\" which is part of their logos and there are no other marks on the fret board.(Meaning there are no other dots or inlays on the fretboard) The strap peg which on most ML's is on the notch above the neck of the guitar, but for comfort and convenience it has been moved to back of the guitar, and the other strap peg is still in its original position on the top tail of the body. And not a new feature to this body style but surely a good feature is that the input jack is not on the front of the body on the second tail by the control nobs, but it is now on the top tail right above the strap peg for the fact that the input jack would sometimes break because the amp cable would hit up against something, and in turn, would break the input jack. Another thing is that there is only one control nob and it is the master volume because Matt says that he always has the tone nobs all the way on the pickups anyway, and it‚Äôs in the middle nob position so when the whammy bar is used it does not get in the way, and the toggle switch that controls which pickup is selected is in its traditional position on the front tail of the guitar. And to help ensure the sound that Matt Heafy wanted he had his custom USA Dean Matt Heafy ‚ÄúMKH86‚Äù installed in the bridge pickup position and a USA ‚ÄúNostalgia‚Äù in the neck pickup position (Matt Heafy and Dean designed the custom USA Dean Matt Heafy ‚ÄúMKH86‚Äù when they were making the guitar) The bridge consists of an Original Locking Floyd Rose Tremolo System, and to help with keeping the strings in tune when the tremolo or whammy bar is used he had Grover tuners and a locking nut installed. And for Matt's personal preference he has had lead weights put in his guitar to make the guitar much heavier, and the production model will not weigh as much. (In an interview Matt stated that he likes heavy guitars, because it gives him something with substance to play and beat on) And the last thing is that Matt Heafy's signature is on the truss rod cover. And now this guitar comes in a white and red Japanese Rising Sun graphic that continues onto the head stock with a white and red Trivium \\"T\\" that is part of their logo.

He was the son of the artist Saya Aye (painter) (1872‚Äì1930), who in turn was an apprentice of Saya Chone (1866‚Äì1917), a young Royal Artist under King Thibaw. Thus, Saw Maung could directly trace his history of training to the pre-colonial times of Upper Burma when the country was still a monarchy and when Traditional paintings of Buddhist religious scenes was the dominant genre of production. Life and work Saw Maung was widely known for his paintings about the life stories of the Buddha and also for a smaller oeuvre of Western-style portraits and landscapes. He was born in Mandalay in 1900, and began his career as an artist at the age of 14, under his father, Saya Aye, whose business he inherited. In the early colonial period, he achieved recognition through his paintings illustrating magazines such as the Myanmar Alin, Dagon and Kawi Myethman. After the Second World War, he visited London, where he studied European styles of painting and also took trips to the USA, China, and Hong Kong. His paintings exhibited fine workmanship. His illustrations of the sixteen point dreams of King Pasenadi of Kosala still hang on the side walls of Kyauktawgyi Buddha Temple. Legacy It is difficult to judge Saw Maung's legacy for he spent most of his life painting Buddhist works for pagodas and temples in Upper Burma during a period of time when the vanguard in painting in Burma had switched to secular fine-art works heavily influenced by Western techniques and subjects. Saw Maung had as many as 20 painters working in his crew, depicting Buddhist works throughout Burma. The painters under his instruction or pay did fine art secular work in their free time as Saw Maung did. Among his crew were his close contemporaries, Chit Myae (c. 1903-76) and Chit Maung (1908‚Äì73), who became well-known secular-style watercolorists. Other painters in his crew, such as Ba Moe (1912‚Äì96) (his son-in-law), Kham Lun (1915‚Äì85), Kan Chun (Painter) (1928‚Äì95) (not to be confused with Kan Chun, the cartoonist), and Ohn Maung (1918‚Äì96) also sometimes produced stunning secular paintings, usually in oil. Because many of these painters were busy making a living under Saw Maung, their secular oeuvres are generally not large, and they and Saw Maung cannot be said to have belonged to a \\"movement\\" of art in Burma per se.

According to Article 1 of the Act, its goal is to ensure that \\"Working conditions shall be those which should meet the needs of workers who live lives worthy of human beings.\\"Japan Institute for Labor Policy and Training Labor Standards Act  Historical background  As the Second World War was nearing its end, on 26 July 1945, Allied leaders Winston Churchill, Harry S Truman, and Chiang Kai-shek issued the Potsdam Declaration, which demanded Japan's unconditional surrender. This declaration also defined the major goals of the postsurrender Allied occupation: \\"The Japanese government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established\\" (Section 10). In addition, the document stated: \\"The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government\\" (Section 12). The Allies sought not merely punishment or reparations from a militaristic foe, but fundamental changes in the nature of its political system. In the words of political scientist Robert E. Ward: \\"The occupation was perhaps the single most exhaustively planned operation of massive and externally directed political change in world history.\\" Allied Occupation of Japan After the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, allied forces, mostly American, rapidly began arriving in Japan. Almost immediately, the occupiers began an intensive program of legal changes designed to democratize Japan. While it was created while Japan was under occupation, the origins of the Act have nothing to do with the occupation forces. It appears to have been the brainchild of Kosaku Teramoto, a former member of the Thought Police, who was now the head of the Labor Standards section of the Welfare Ministry. The situation during the occupation was very confusing, and Teramoto managed to convince a number of industrialists, bureaucrats, and politicians that GHQ was demanding strict controls on working conditions. He and a small staff then drafted the bill, based on prewar provisions that had been suspended by the military government, as well as a review of International Labor Organization conventions. The occupation authorities knew nothing about the bill until Teramoto handed it to Theodore Cohen, head of GHQ's Labor Division. The Americans gave the law their blessing, and Teramoto was able to tell the industrialists, bureaucrats and politicians that they had no choice but to go along with what the occupation forces wanted.Dower, John.

He belonged to the group of New York School Abstract expressionist artists of the 1950s. He wrote: > In moments of clarity of thought I can sustain the idea that everything on > earth is nature, including that which springs forth from a man's mind, and > hand. A Franz Kline is nature as much as a zinnia. Biography Nanno de Groot was born March 23, 1913 in Balkbrug, Netherlands. In 1930‚Äì1933 he went to the nautical school in Amsterdam, Netherlands. After graduation he received third mate and radio operator's papers. From 1937 to 1941 he worked in the shipping business and lived on the island of Bali. In 1941 he was called for submarine duty by the Dutch Navy and was assigned to Admiral's headquarters on Java where he stayed until the arrival of the Japanese. He was then sent to San Francisco, California USA to serve as liaison officer to the US Army and US Navy in charge of running troop ships between the west coast and the western Pacific, chartered by the United States. He was Lieutenant Commander in charge of the Dutch Port Authority in San Francisco. The position discontinued in 1946. He applied for US citizenship. He became a US citizen in 1954. Artistic career Nanno de Groot started drawing at six years of age. His father prevented him to study art at the early age. In 1946 at age 33 he discovered Picasso and he dedicated the rest of his life to painting and drawing. He worked for a year as a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. After his marriage to the New York School artist Elise Asher in 1948 de Groot settled in New York on West 12th Street. He and Elise Asher divorced in 1957, and she subsequently married poet Stanley Kunitz. Nanno de Groot became connected to the pioneers of the New York School. De Groot considered himself an American artist and part of the abstract expressionist movement. He participated from 1954 to 1957 in the invitational New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals These Annuals were important because the participants were chosen by the artists themselves.

He is modeled after a grizzly bear, in reference to the nickname of the university's athletic teams, the Grizzlies. History Starting in 1897, the University of Montana used live bear cubs to promote their athletic teams, who were then simply known as the Bears. The university went through several bear cubs, often being forced to replace the bear at the end of every football season as it grew too large to be easily shuttled from game to game. The mascots had several different names through the years, including three bears named Fessy, in honor of famed University of Montana football coach Doug Fessden, and a bear named Jerry, in honor of coach Jerry Williams. However, live bears cubs were visibly uncomfortable during games, especially as the crowd grew loud. They would often be held in chains.\\"Jerry\\". The Kaimin, November 29, 1956. Outside the sports arenas, the bears were occasionally subject to kidnappings, publicity hoaxes, and animal rights protests.\\"Making Bear-Facts Riles Farmers Guarding Fessy\\". The Kaimin, November 2, 1937. One ran away successfully.\\"Fessy Returns to Wild Haunts\\". The Kaimin, May 6, 1933. Following a particularly poor football season in 1956, a rumor started that the school was euthanizing the bears.Jackson, Genell. \\"Is the Mascot a Loser Too?\\" The Kaimin, December 6, 1956. Press and student outbursts at the complications of live bear mascots led the university to try a more conventional approach, and in the 1970s, the Grizzlies were backed by a variety of traditional company-sponsored costumed mascots. These included the Hamm's Beer Bear, Domino's Pizza's Noid, and at one point, Ronald McDonald. The local business Grizzly Auto Centers sponsored Otto the Grizzly, who was the primary mascot for the athletics teams for most of the 1980s, beginning in 1983 with student Jan Nesset. Like Otto, previous bear mascots were designed to be fierce and aggressive, even wolf-like;Haines, Eric. E-mail interview conducted by Teresa Hamann, October 5, 2006. it wasn't until the athletics department conferred with mascot experts that it was decided to design a more engaging, friendly and energetic mascot. It was then in 1991 that Monte was developed.NWDA Guide to Archive Collections website Monte debuted at the start of the 1993 season. In his first game as mascot, the Grizzlies came back to win after a 31-point deficit against South Dakota.Walterskirchen, Chris. Telephone interview conducted by Teresa Hamann, October 10, 2006. Costume and Performance The person behind the mask is typically chosen by the university athletics' Assistant Marketing Director, in an auditioning process informally known as Monte Idol. An unwritten rule keeps the current Monte's real identity secret until he or she is no longer enrolled in the university, at which point another Monte is chosen. There are usually two students with the role of Monte during any given year, to ensure Monte will always be available. Though the job is unpaid, the occupant does receive a tuition waiver.Nickell, Joe. \\"Monte Idol to decide future UM mascot\\". The Missoulian, August 20, 2009. Most notable of the costume-wearers was Barry Anderson, who wore the Monte suit for five years in the 2000s and went on to work for the Chicago Bulls' mascot team.UMT website In the beginning of Monte's life, the costume was heavier and poorly ventilated. The head was secured by only a small strap. Scott Stiegler, the first university student to don the costume full-time, developed a bicycle helmet with foam around it to affix the head of the costume more efficiently.Stiegler, Scott. Telephone interview conducted by Teresa Hamann. October 10, 2006. Peripheral vision was still compromised, and Monte could occasionally be seen tripping over bleachers and small children during the first few games. While visibility has been improved, Monte still must feel his way around with his hands to avoid tripping. Monte has a variety of different ways of entertaining crowds at sports games. A marked departure from previous mascots, Monte is considerably acrobatic, doing flips and cartwheels to celebrate favorable gameplay. He frequently interacts with children, something previous mascots were unable to do because of their bulky costume or frightening appearance. The philosophy is that Monte must remain unpredictable, always surprising fans.Stiegler, Scott. Telephone interview conducted by Teresa Hamann. October 10, 2006. Monte has been known to enter games on motorcycles, four-wheelers and horseback, always surrounded by cheerleaders. His effect on crowd energy and team performance has been enormously positive. In the 13 years after Monte started entertaining audiences at games, the Grizzly football team had won more games than they had in the 25 years prior.Haines, Eric. E-mail interview conducted by Teresa Hamann, October 5, 2006. Monte averages around 200 public appearances per year, with only around 50 of those being in sports arenas.Moy, Chelsi. \\"He‚Äôs a mascot, a hot commodity and a moneymaker\\". The Missoulian, October 22, 2010. As such, he is more than the athletics mascot and has been regarded as a mascot for the university as a whole. The university has used Monte to spread school spirit at birthday parties, weddings, corporate functions, and even funerals. Local businesses have featured Monte in their advertisements, and his likeness is used to help incoming freshmen with \\"Ask Monte,\\" an online Q&A; service on the university's website. In 2008, he starred in the children's book \\"The Great Monte Mystery,\\" written by university alum Jennifer Newbold.UMT website National exposure Monte has been nominated as Capital One's Mascot of the Year five times, winning twice --- in 2002, and again in 2004.The Capital One Bowl The contest features 15 or more nominees pitted against each other, one at a time, with users and judges voting on their favorite of each match-up. The winner is the last standing. Nominees win $5,000 for their school; winners receive an additional $5,000 and are featured in a broadcast of an NFL game. Monte is the only mascot to have won twice.

She spent her early years working on the family farm just out of Perth as she attended school and watched her parents work at nights in various entertainment venues around Western Australia.  Background  {{At the age of 15, Nicki had her first professional engagement as a backing vocalist for Jackie Love's Western Australia tour. At 17 Nicki joined her first band, Perth's \\"The Power Station\\" a seven piece rock covers band that later became a five piece \\"Cold Chisel\\" cover band called \\"East\\". Nicki played in numerous Perth based bands and toured nationally with Buckshot Dolly a six piece Country Rock band that she formed with her mother Lucy D'Olimpio in 1992. In 1996 she decided at the last minute to enter Australia's premier country music talent competition, the Gympie Muster Talent Quest, which she won[1]. In 1997, Nicki recorded her first self penned collection of songs ‚Äì this EP, \\"Nicki\\", was then released to radio in Australia. After 18 months living in Brisbane, Nicki returned to Western Australia to spend time writing and recording. In 2002 she headlined the World Women's Hockey Championships and performed via satellite to viewers in 16 countries. In 2004, Nicki moved to Sydney to progress a career as a solo entertainer and initially joined with Newcastle-based, Brooke Leale, in an acoustic duet called \\"Velvet Moon\\". This was a project that lasted two years before Nicki and Brooke went on their own personal music ventures. In 2005, Nicki released her first recording ‚Äì \\"Nicki\\" EP ‚Äì a subdued introspective blend of songs bordering on acoustic folk rock rather than Nicki's trademark country infused rock of recent years. This was followed by a second EP, \\"On The Mountain\\" and a limited edition album titled \\"To Here/Hear\\". She later combined these three releases into one album calling it \\"On The Mountain ‚Äì Special Edition\\". Nicki's album \\"Lucy's Daughter\\" was released in Australia in 2007 to great applause and received glowing reviews from all areas. Re-released in the UK in 2010 the album included a bonus track, \\"On The Mountain\\" and was broadly accepted as a quality release, with much praise from reviewers in some of the UK's leading genre specific music magazines. Nicki's third recording, a joint effort with Bob Howe, called \\"Collaboration\\" was a collection of cover versions of classic rock songs that had inspired her and Bob throughout their careers. Including songs originally performed by T-Rex, REM and Snow Patrol. The album maintained a country infused feel and also received positive acclaim across the industry. In 2011, Nicki's fourth album was released in response to requests from audiences across the world. Consisting of cover versions of songs from 1965 ‚Äì 1975 that were made famous by strong women with a message. This album, \\"Woman of Substance\\" has provided Nicki's fans with a valuable insight into the songs and women that inspired Nicki from a very young age. Nicki has toured the UK, US, South Pacific, Middle East, Germany and South East Asia. This considerable international experience has allowed her to develop a stage show that takes audiences on a journey from nostalgic and classic hits through to contemporary rock and self-penned hits. Nicki toured the UK in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 with a band that has consisted of players such as Bob Howe on guitar, Lee Goodwin on Guitar, Cozy Dixon on drums, Dave Clemo on bass who was replaced in 2012 due to illness by Lee Jackson. Her Australian band consists of Mitch Hutchinson on guitar, Dave Roberts on drums, Justin Bianchi on bass and Bryen Willems on acoustic guitar. Nicki's music and performances engage audiences from many different demographics and musical genres. She donates significant time to charity work and is a strong supporter of returned Australian and UK service men and women. She has also been overseas to perform for Australian, US, British and NATO troops in Iraq, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. In 2010 she was granted honorary membership of the Blue Mountains Vietnam Veterans and Associated Forces Association. In 2011 she was made a member of the Australian Forces Entertainment Association and won the Australian Entertainment Industry's highest award for a country performer. In 2011 Nicki set up her own production company, LockHouse Productions, with business partner Tracy Dann. The company assisted unsigned Australian and New Zealand artists develop a presence in the entertainment industry. Capitalising on her own experience, the company quickly signed some of the biggest names in the independent country music field in Australia and was responsible for the record breaking 10 weeks at #1 in the UK charts for Nashville's Branch and Dean's release of \\"Your Ol' Lady's Gone\\". In 2012 and 2013 Nicki continued to develop her international standing through further tours across Australia and the UK and into Germany for the first time where her own style of Sophisticated Country Rock Music was very well accepted. 2013 was also the year she went heavily into theatre production by co-producing the stage show, \\"When Aussies Ruled Britannia\\" ‚Äì a new style of theatre/concert that was coined \\"Oral History Theatre\\". In this show '60s superstars Frank Ifield and Keith Potger (from The Seekers) tell their stories to a background of their hits sung by Nicki and Wayne Horsburgh. In 2014 Nicki withdrew from consistent live performances to concentrate on building a music school, focussing on voice and performance, in Sydney's outer western suburbs. During this period she mentored and developed young performers, many of whom have gone on to write and record their own material and others who have performed in high- profile entertainment events in Sydney. During this year she also co-produced and co-starred in \\"Frank Ifield Remembers\\", a two-hour stage show where Frank tells his life story to a background of songs and music from the era. 2015 saw Nicki develop her school whilst still writing and recording new material. She also took to community events within the Nepean Valley region and assisted with charity events and fundraising. This was the year she developed another stage show called \\"Ladies Rock\\", a two-hour theatre concert celebrating the contribution of women to the history for popular music. In 2016 Nicki continued nurturing local talent under the umbrella of her music school. She was also asked to join the sales and marketing team at VintageFM in outer Sydney. She continued writing and recording despite numerous personal and health setbacks. In 2016 she also starred alongside 60s pop legend, Frank Ifield, in her own television program, \\"Australian Country Showcase\\". Australian Country Showcase is broadcast across Europe and the United Kingdom on Keep It Country TV on Sky, Freesat and Freeview. The show is produced by Lockhouse Productions with Tracy Dann is the producer and director of the show. 2017 saw Nicki decide to focus back on her singer/songwriter roots and release new material. Her first release through Hotdisc Rush Release to UK and European radio climbed steadily until reaching number 1 on the charts. Nicki also toured the UK with her new stage show, \\"Tapestry The Concert\\" - a celebration of the songs of Carole King performed live with band. In 2017, Nicki also took on the role of General Manager at VintageFM.

Cozy Dell formation, Topatopa Mountains. The Cozy Dell Shale is a geologic formation of middle Eocene age that crops out in the Santa Ynez Mountains and Topatopa Mountains of California, extending from north of Fillmore in Ventura County westward to near Point Arguello, north of Santa Barbara. Because the Cozy Dell easily weathers to a clay-rich soil, it crops out infrequently and generally forms dense stands of chaparral in saddles between peaks and ridges of the more resistant Matilija and Coldwater formations. Type locality and extent Close-up of bedding in the Cozy Dell Shale. Scale is about across. De-watering pipes above a high-density turbidite, Cozy Dell formation, Topatopa Mountains. Flame structures and convolute laminations in a sandy turbidite, Cozy Dell formation, Topatopa Mountains. The Cozy Dell was first described in 1928 as the middle member of the Tejon Formation. However, Dibblee (1966) reclassified it as a formation, along with the underlying Matilija Sandstone and overlying Coldwater Sandstone. He also named the formation after its type locality at Cozy Dell Canyon, which is located on the south side of Nordhoff Ridge, just north of Ojai in Ventura County. The Cozy Dell crops out continuously in the mountains to the north and east of Ojai, where it is exposed along much of the south slope of the Topatopa Mountains in Ventura County, and continues westward along the south slope of Santa Ynez Mountains into Santa Barbara County. Here, it is overlain by younger rocks at San Marcos Pass, on the crest of the Santa Ynez Range, cropping out west of the pass and forming much of the crest north of Goleta. It disappears north of the Santa Ynez Mountains beneath younger formations, and is removed, for the most part, by erosion north of the Santa Ynez River, where it appears at only a few localities. It grades into and is overlain by the Sacate Formation in the western part of its outcrop belt, and dips south beneath the modern California coastal plain in the southern part. Continuing south into the offshore region beneath the Santa Barbara Channel, the Cozy Dell is found in oil wells at Molino field some feet below the sea floor. The thickness of the formation increases, more or less, from east to west and averages about in the Santa Ynez Mountains. However, thicknesses vary widely, ranging from a maximum of west of San Marcos Pass, to thick in the subsurface of the offshore Hondo Oil Field, and only thick in the offshore Molino Gas Field, which is located west of Hondo. Description The Cozy Dell is a gray to dark gray argillaceous to silty shale that weathers to brown and olive. It contains minor sandstone beds at some localities, and some conglomerate at others, most significantly west of San Marcos Pass. When exposed to surface conditions, it breaks down quickly to form a clay-rich soil that supports dense chaparral growth. Because the Cozy Dell is layered between the highly resistant Matilija and Coldwater sandstones, and turned up on end through most of its extent, it erodes to create passes and saddles between peaks and ridges of the adjacent units. Paleontology, age and depositional environments Microfauna in the Cozy Dell, primarily planktonic (i.e., floating) foraminifera, place it in the upper part of the Lutetian stage (middle Eocene) of the geologic timescale - the Lutetian correlating, more or less, to the middle part of a local Californian stage named the Narizian that is based largely on benthic (i.e., bottom-dwelling) foraminifera. Although the formation is rich in microfossils, especially ones indicating deep-marine deposition, no significant larger fossils have been found in southwestern Santa Barbara County. However, some larger fossils have been found in a few localities in the Topatopa Mountains to the east in Ventura County, particularly in the upper Sespe Creek area near Ojai, which contains an unusual shallow-marine assemblage of molluscs, starfish and brittle stars, as well as plant imprints that indicate close proximity to an ancient shoreline. The Cozy Dell represents a time when the Eocene sea covering the California border land region reached its widest extent and maximum water depths. Thus, only the finest-grained sediments, principally a micaceous mud, reached the ocean bottom. A fairly high organic content of up to 3% or more of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in these sediments indicate that microorganisms flourished and that there were anoxic conditions on the ocean floor conducive to the preservation of organic matter. These observations, together with the fossil evidence, indicate that the Cozy Dell was deposited in an ocean basin with a shoreline on what today would be the east and north side of the basin and gradually deepening to the west to water depths of possibly a thousand feet or more. Magnetostratigraphy Recent magnetostratigraphic dating demonstrates that the Cozy Dell at its type locality was deposited during the chron 20 geomagnetic reversal through the chron 19 reversal - approximately 46 to 42 Ma (million years ago), which is consistent with deposition during Lutetian time. The paleomagnetic data also show that the tectonic block on which the Cozy Dell was deposited with other Eocene formations has rotated clockwise about 100 degrees since the onset of deposition. Thus, modern-day east-west trends indicated within the formation would originally have been oriented north-south. Economic importance The Cozy Dell is grouped with underlying and overlying sandstones as a potential hydrocarbon resource. Where this shale is found in the subsurface of oil and gas fields on the California coast, and offshore in the Santa Barbara Channel, it tends to be impermeable to fluid flow, as with most shales, and represents a cap rock that can trap hydrocarbons in underlying sandstone reservoirs. However, a few offshore oil fields contain sections of Cozy Dell with sufficient porosity to act as petroleum reservoirs, and sufficient permeability to produce hydrocarbons at economic rates. One example is the now-abandoned Cuarta field, located about six miles offshore from Gaviota, where the Cozy Dell is mainly shale but contains minor sandstone interbeds that previously produced oil from feet below the ocean floor.

Although there is no onshore oil or gas production from the Cozy Dell, its organic content is high enough that some geologists believe it may be a potential source rock for petroleum found in other units.
