He is a vertebrate paleontologist and holds an Associate Professor position at the Natural History Museum of the University of Oslo. He has studied dinosaurs, primitive mammals and plesiosaurs.  Media  Hurum is known as a popularizer of science with a high media profile. He is the author of the book Menneskets utvikling (\\"The Evolution of Man\\") and the host of the segment J√∏rns hj√∏rne (\\"J√∏rn's Corner\\") on the popular-science program \\"Newton\\" on Norwegian television. He also co- hosts the radio program Hurum og √òdegaard (\\"Hurum and √òdegaard\\") with astrophysicist Knut J√∏rgen R√∏ed √òdegaard on Norwegian radio. In 2001, Hurum was awarded Oslo University's \\"Formidlingspris,\\" an award for the popularization of science, which he shared with Hans Arne Nakrem and Geir S√∏li. He was awarded the prize again in 2009 for his work publicizing \\"Ida\\", the Darwinius find.  Discoveries  Hurum has done work on a wide range of vertebrate palaeontology, ranging from Mesozoic mammals, theropod dinosaurs and plesiosaurs from Svalbard. In 2006 his team uncovered an enormous short- necked plesiosaur, the Pliosaurus funkei, possibly the largest carnivore found to date.Low resolusion pdf High resolusion pdf His main work continues to be in the field of plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs from Svalbard. In May, 2009, he announced the acquisition and scientific description of a 47-million-year-old, 95% complete skeleton of a primitive primate, Darwinius masillae, that had been in the private collection of an amateur fossil collector for 25 years. Hurum named the specimen \\"Ida\\", after his daughter.  Controversy  Some experts in the scientific community were critical of the 2009 media campaign Hurum orchestrated to publicize his find Darwinius masillae. Matt Cartmill, an anthropologist from Duke University, said \\"The P.R. campaign on this fossil is I think more of a story than the fossil itself\\". Hurum's reputation was further tarnished when it turned out that the fossil was not a \\"Revolutionary Scientific Find That Will Change Everything,\\" as he had claimed in his press release, and that some of the key scientific claims he had made for Darwinius masillae failed scientific scrutiny.Fossil primate challenges Ida's place Nature 461, 1040 (2009) Hurum was named a 2011 National Geographic Emerging Explorer.

A real life castle stood in the background of the park, behind the miniature golf course. The castle housed several arcade and boardwalk games; as well as a concession and food area. The restrooms with small locker areas were also housed inside the complex. Outside, the park had an area for small motor boats. Two separate loading lanes were incorporated into the pool for this activity. The batting cage circle was right next to the mini-boats.

Spey casting can be accomplished with either a normal length fly rod, or a rod referred to as a double-handed fly rod, often called a Spey rod. Spey rods can also be used for standard overhead casting. Spey casting is used for fishing large rivers for salmon and large trout such as steelhead and sea trout. Spey technique is also used in saltwater surf casting. All of these situations require the angler to cast larger flies long distances. The two-handed Spey technique allows more powerful casts and avoids obstacles on the shore by keeping most of the line in front of the angler.  History  An illustration of a double-handed fly cast from The Salmon Fly by George M. Kelson (1895) Spey casting originated in the heart of Scotland in the mid-1800s. The name comes from the River Spey in Scotland, which is where the cast originated, presumably at Gordon Castle Estate and Wester Elchies beat. Therefore, the Spey cast was developed so one could successfully cast on a large river such as the Spey. When Spey casting was introduced, rods were used. These rods were made of greenheart, a heavy wood imported from British Guyana. Today, rods are only in length, and can toss a line up to . There are two groups of Spey casts, the \\"splash and go\\" and the \\"waterborne anchor\\". Splash and go casts contain a backstroke that is in the air. The line then falls to the water, and the forward cast starts as soon as the tip of the line touches the water. The waterborne anchor casts are different, as they contain a backcast that stays on the water. In these types of casts, there is no requirement to achieve perfect timing in order to forward cast after. While there are many variations of the Spey cast, the basic technique is broken down into a few simple actions. With the fly line floating directly downstream, the angler first lifts the line off the water with the tip of the rod. The angler then sweeps the line backwards just above the water, and allows just the fly and leader to \\"anchor\\" the cast by touching the water one to two rod lengths away. This back-cast is often referred to as the \\"D-loop\\", from the curving shape of the line between the anchor and the tip of the rod. While swinging the \\"D-loop\\", it is important to make one continuous, deliberate motion with the rod tip climbing at a 45-degree angle off the water. As the D-loop comes around, the cast is completed by firing the line forward with a sharp two-handed \\"push-pull\\" motion on the handle of the rod while making an abrupt stop with the rod tip at the end of the cast. The cast is most easily compared to a roll cast in one-handed fly fishing, although by using the fly as an anchor, a Spey cast allows a greater loading of the rod and thus achieves greater distance than a one-handed cast.  Styles of Spey casting  The two most commonly used styles of Spey casting are the \\"Single Spey\\" and the \\"Double Spey\\". Mastering both the Single Spey cast and the Double Spey cast will be essential if the fly caster is to be able to cast from either bank of the river in whatever type of wind that may be present. =Single Spey casting= The Single Spey cast may be considered better by some, as it cast the line further, and it can be used with winds blowing upstream. This Single Spey cast is part of the \\"Splash and Go\\" (or touch & Go/Kiss & Go) group of casts. =Double Spey casting= The Double Spey cast may be considered easier to perform than the Single Spey, but only because this cast can be performed more slowly and deliberately, and corrections more easily made during elements of the cast. It is a sustained anchor cast in that some of the fly line stays in contact with the water at all times until the final forward casting stroke is made. This Double Spey cast is useful in downstream winds.  World records  The world's longest single spey cast was made by Tommy Aarkvisla from Norway. The cast measured , and was made during the Fly Casting World Championship in 2018.

Peter Tatchell, gay human rights campaigner, was involved in the action which was one of a series which influenced the development of gay activism in the UK, received media attention at the time, and is still discussed by some of those involved. Background The Gay Liberation Front in the UK was formed in 1970 in response to the formation of the GLF in the US, which was established after the Stonewall riot in 1969. Prior to the formation of GLF in the UK, the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) had been the primary focus for the campaign for gay rights; CHE focused on lobbying government for specific legal reforms, while GLF campaigned for systemic changes in society that would lead to wider acceptance of lesbian and gay people. GLF existed for four years in the UK, and this action was one of the best known and controversial actions they undertook, one which featured in the national news at the time. Public figures involved at the time still describe their experience today. This was period when lesbian and gay people were shifting from an approach that was apologetic to one of pride. In 1971 the UK GLF published its Manifesto and held a series of high-profile direct actions, including the one at the Festival of Light.Fife Men Project: Overview of Lesbian and Gay History The Festival of Light included several notable people of that time, such as Cliff Richard, Mary Whitehouse, Malcolm Muggeridge and Lord Longford. It was an organisation which lobbied the UK Government and held public rallies to show support for their lobbying. Muggeridge and Whitehouse identified certain liberalisations in law, and public acceptance of certain phenomena, as moral evil; examples are extra- marital sex, pornography in films, sex on TV, abortion-rights, and openly gay individuals. Activism as theatre Ink: Gay Liberation Front cover, London, 1971 Drawing on the gay tradition of camp, GLF developed a new style of political campaigning, \\"protest as performance\\", where the claim for human rights was projected through creativity, using imagination, daring and wit, rather than marches and rallies.Obituary: MARTIN ROGER CORBETT: Queer Activist and Saint, 27-November-1944 - 11-July-1996 These actions were called \\"zaps\\", intended to reduce the rallies to a farcical shambles. The Festival of Light was the most notable of these. One of those who embraced this style of activism was Bette Bourne, the message of gay liberation being couched in comedy, song, tap routines and make-up. \\"We were finding a new way of doing drag that wasn't offensive to women, that wasn't about false tits and distasteful jokes. We saw ourselves as a new type of man. We could wear frocks and make-up and be silly and funny, but we had a serious message, too.\\" This began a tradition of drag continued through the work of performers like David Hoyle down, a style of drag, separate from the aggressive form of \\"female impersonation\\". Another figure who was involved in the disruption was Martin Corbett, who walked into the basement of Westminster Central Hall, ordered the staff to leave with an assumed authority, and plunged the Festival into darkness by disconnecting the electrical and broadcasting cables. Peter Tatchell described the Festival of Light as being against the \\"moral darkness\\" of \\"pornography, homosexuality and abortion.\\" The GLF counter-protest was code-named \\"Operation Rupert' after the subversive 'Rupert Bear' cartoon in OZ magazine. He attended the Festival action as part of the GLF Youth Group. \\"When Malcolm Muggeridge, speaking out about homosexuals, declared: 'I don't like them.' The feeling was mutual,\\" the group he was part of staged a \\"kiss- in\\" in the upper balcony of the hall. \\"Mice were released into the audience; lesbian couples stood up and passionately embraced. A dozen GLF nuns in immaculate blue and white habits charged the platform shouting gay liberation slogans, and a GLF bishop began preaching an impromptu sermon which urged people to 'keep on sinning.'\\" Radical Drag The theme known as \\"radical drag\\" was a central element to the Festival of Light and subsequent GLF actions. In response to ideas about the 'wrong-sex', gay people distanced themselves from stereotypes of effeminate gay men and butch lesbians, in a way in which gay people were supposed to appear like anybody else. Within the Gay Liberation Movement there was also a deeper questioning of the validity of gender roles. The philosophy underlying radical drag rejected the concepts of masculinity and femininity, which correlated to ideas of dominance and submission. The idea of men who are really women, or of 'real men' dissolves in this deconstruction. In dissociating from the stigma of effeminacy in order to gain acceptance in heterosexual society, gay men tacitly supported the rigidity of gender roles, a definition of men from which they were excluded because of their sexuality. Gay men were complicit in the oppression of the effeminate gay men who adopted that stereotype, often denouncing the camp queens and diesel dykes who had 'come out' and born the brunt of homopbobia before those who were more discreet themselves felt comfortable enough to come out. In 1974, to counteract this, the GLF stated that it had developed \\"a strong section of opinion which claims that the only way for gay people to come out that will make any real impact on the gender role definitions which underlie gay oppression is by adopting a life-style and appearance that explicitly reject the masculine/feminine distinction and all that it implies.\\" Subsequent campaigns and other actions The work of GLF in this and other actions and demonstrations helped inspire more people towards open activism. Following the style of campaign and public demonstration, CHE changed its own style of campaigning, and interest in GLF waned. After the demise of GLF, Peter Tatchell went on to form OutRage!, which still performs strategic actions in which individuals, organisations and countries identified as homophobic are openly confronted in provocative ways, such as at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest.Tatchell arrested in Moscow gay rights demonstration Other actions and acts of civil disobedience confronting discrimination and homophobia at the time included a picket at Pan Books in protest at the publication of a book by Dr. David Reuben, which claimed that gay men were obsessed with the anal insertion of vegetables, freedom rides and sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve 'poofs' and 'dykes', the occupation of Coutts Bank because of their holding the Maudsley Hospital account (where aversion therapy was still being practiced in the early 1970s) and the confrontation of Professor Hans Eysenck during a lecture in which he advocated electric-shock and aversion therapy to cure homosexuality. Tatchell talks of this time, \\"As well as being politics with fun, this activism helped banish our internalised shame, repairing much of the damage that homophobia had done to us. Through GLF, we became happier, more confident queers, unafraid to challenge even the most powerful homophobes.\\" See also * Gay liberation * Socialism and LGBT rights * Gay Activists Alliance * USA GLF: N.

The site was mostly in Washir District and was conjoined with Camp Bastion, which was the main British military base in Afghanistan and Camp Shorabak which initially was the main Afghan section however the three sites were joined together under the name of 'Camp Shorabak' in 2014. Control of the site was transferred from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to the Afghan Armed Forces on 26 October 2014. History Camp Leatherneck was master-planned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Europe District FEST-A Team from Wiesbaden, Germany in October/November 2008. Upon arrival to Kandahar, the team was tasked by the Theater Engineer of U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) to find a suitable location in Helmand Province for 2K-15K troops. The primary purpose for the base was to house troops for a majority of an estimated 26,000 additional U.S. troops being deployed to Afghanistan. Throughout all of southern Afghanistan, bases were all at or above capacity leading to the paramount need for a large centrally located base for the surge. The site was chosen primarily to take advantage of the adjacent British Airfield on Camp Bastion and to provide much needed protection to the primary east-west corridor of Highway 1 in Helmand Province. The 25th Naval Construction Regiment (25th NCR) was the primary construction unit with construction oversight and the command element that the FEST Design team was later attached during the initial stages of construction. The units responsible for the overall construction work in 2008 under the 25th NCR was the Naval Mobile Construction Battalions Seven, Five, and Seventy- Four.http://www.navy.mil/view_single.asp?id=68433 Navy News Service - Eye on the Fleethttp://www.navy.mil/view_single.asp?id=69405 Navy News Service - Eye on the FleetNavy News Service - Eye on the Fleet Camp Leatherneck was built in a modular fashion to maximize the efficiency of construction locations to provide housing and work space as surge forces flowed into theater. The base layout was designed in modular 'blocks', so the base could have forces on the ground as construction continued in adjacent compartments. All aspects of the design were focused on the speed for construction and with the understanding that the number of troops was unknown. Initially dubbed Tombstone II as an expansion of a smaller Special Forces Camp adjacent to the ANA Shorabak base, it was eventually renamed Camp Leatherneck once it was formerly announced that I Marine Expeditionary Force would move to southern Afghanistan and determined the main force occupying the base in 2009. The authorization to move forces was not given until after new Commander-in-Chief Inauguration of President Obama in early 2009. CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter flies over a Seabee project site in January 2011 From Design to Initial Occupancy of Forces was only four months with a late-November 2008 ground-breaking. Although construction was continued by the Marines for several years to improve facilities, the overall basecamp was functional and operational in less than six months for over 12,000 troops and an equal number of civilian contractors prior to their arrival. Marines from the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade arrived in March 2009 to establish Command and Control of Camp Leatherneck and prepare for the arrival of I Marine Expeditionary Force to assume the role as the Regional Command Southwest who ultimately replaced the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade in March 2010.http://www.news- record.com/content/2008/09/30/article/nc_marines_paratroopers_will_deploy_to_iraq National Geographic Explorer profiled the base in a 2010 episode. On 16 May 2010, the Supply Management Unit lot had a fire that burned for over 8 hours, causing extensive damage. Marine Wing Support Squadron 274's CFR (Crash Fire Rescue), Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FIVE, and British firefighters from Camp Bastion were responsible for extinguishing the blaze. http://archive.vcstar.com/news/nmcb-5-helps-extinguish-blaze-in-afghanistan- ep-368861343-349490771.html/ Throughout most of the firefighting effort, Camp Leatherneck was also hit with one of their most intense sandstorms to date. In 2011, security responsibilities for Camp Leatherneck and the surrounding area were assumed by Task Force Belleau Wood, commanded by US Marine Colonel Michael Sweeney.http://www.dvidshub.net/news/81718/task-force-belleau- wood#.UuLy1WQo7x4 In 2012, the adjacent Camp Bastion was attacked by Taliban forces, killing two Americans and significantly damaging American aircraft. In 2013, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John F. Sopko, stated that $34 million had been spent on a 64,000-square-foot facility that \\"presumably will never be used\\". On 26 October 2014, U.S. Marines and British combat troops officially marked the end of their operations in Afghanistan, transferring Camps Leatherneck and Bastion to Afghan control. As national anthems from the three countries played, service members from all three countries stood at attention. The Marine flags were ceremoniously furled and cased, in recognition of the end of mission. Environmental issues When the Camp was turned over to Afghan control in 2014, 420,000 bottles of water, \\"which if lined up end to end would stretch for more than 50 miles\\" were left behind.

The last contest had come in 1892, with Gunter winning easily; Robert Gunter CandidatesConservatives= Because of ill health, Gunter had told his local party in 1903, that he would be standing down as MP. They had then selected 35 year old George Lane-Fox, an Eton and Oxford educated barrister and a member of the West Riding County CouncilThe Times, 9 October 1905 p11 to be their candidate. =Liberals= The Liberals had already selected 32 year old Joseph Andrews, a barrister from Leeds to fight the next general election.The Times, 12 April 1905 p5 They adopted Andrews as their by-election candidate. =Other= There was speculation that an Independent candidate, Henry Liversidge, would also stand. Earlier in 1905 he announced an intention to contest the next election as a Lib-Lab candidate, but on the platform of tariff reform.The Times, 22 September 1905 It was subsequently reported that no Tariff Reform League or other candidate would be standing specifically on that issue.The Times, 25 September 1905 p9 Campaign The political tide seemed to be flowing against the Tory government of Arthur Balfour. In 1903 they had lost five seats in by-elections, in 1904 another seven and six seats had been gained by the Liberals in by-elections so far in 1905.Roy Douglas, History of the Liberal Party 1895-1970; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p30 =Tariff Reform= Although no tariff candidate entered the field, the issue of protectionism was one of the great issues of the day. Whereas the question of Irish Home Rule had dominated political debate in earlier elections, the ‚Äòdumping‚Äô of foreign goods on British markets and the struggle between tariff reformers and free traders was now seen as a prime election battleground.The Times, 3 October 1905 p7 The Free Trade Union, founded in 1903 to safeguard the free import of food and raw materials and oppose the policy of protection as a barrier to good relations within the British EmpireChris Cook, Sources in British Political History, 1900-1951 Volume 1; Macmillan, 1975 p101 had acquired a reputation for intelligent and effective electioneering on behalf of Liberal candidates and had moved some key organisers into the Barkston Ash constituency to offer support to Andrews and to campaign and produce literature and posters for him.The Times, 6 October 1905 p5 The Liberals played the Free Trade card for all it was worth.The Times 9 October 1905 p11 =Agricultural labour= There was a strong mining community in the south of the constituency which traditionally supported the Liberals and a substantial suburban house-holder vote spreading out from Leeds, which together with the farmers and landowners could usually be relied upon to vote Conservative. This meant the agricultural labourers held the key to the result.The Times, 4 October 1905 p11 Both candidates courted the votes of the rural worker, Andrews emphasising the value of Free Trade in keeping food prices cheap whereas Lane-Fox appealed to the traditional conservatism of rural people. =Religion= Both candidates also, despite denials were keen to attract votes from the sizeable Roman Catholic minority in the area. The Liberals denounced the Education Act 1902 and hoped for Catholic voters to be sympathetic to Irish Home Rule in support of their co-religionists in Ireland although as the campaign wore on they became vulnerable to attack on the administration of the Education Act by the Liberal controlled West Riding County Council.The Times, 11 October 1905 p8 The Tories looked to the well- established local Catholic community to remain true to their family traditions and support the Conservative establishment. =Foreign affairs= Government policy abroad gave the Liberals little to campaign on. There was a distinct strain of English patriotism in the Yorkshire character and the area had provided strong support over the fighting of the Boer War. The only area left to exploit was the introduction of Chinese labour into South Africa gold mining operationsThe Times, 12 October 1905 p8 and the allegation that so- called coolies were being forced to work under conditions no better than those of slaves.John Hotchkiss Stewart Reid, The origins of the British Labour Party; University of Minnesota Press, 1955 pp107-108 Result The result of the by-election was announced the following day in front of the Selby Museum.Monitor and New Era 20 October 1905 The Liberals gained Barkston Ash from the Conservatives by a majority of 228 votes. Irish Nationalist MP T. P. O'Connor called the election \\"a victory for Ireland\\" because \\"of the firmness with which (voters) refused to Abandon Ireland\\" and \\"have buried the infamous attempt to weaken Ireland by a Redistribution Bill.\\" It was another indication of how the electorate across the country, even in such a traditional Tory constituency, had grown tired of the Conservative government which had been in office for ten years. It was this swing of the pendulum, rather than the specific policy issues or personalities of the candidates, which was responsible for the Liberal victoryThe Times, 16 October 1905 p7 ‚Äì although the question of tariff reform was clearly an influential element in the result and the campaigning efforts of the Free Trade Union played their part in stimulating the electorate and getting them to the polls in greater numbers than their opponents.The Times, 13 October 1905 p8 Aftermath Despite the 1906 Liberal landslide Lane-Fox was returned to parliament three months later and the constituency remained in Tory hands thereafter. As the Commons were not sitting at the time of the by-election, Andrews was one of the few people in history to be elected to parliament but never to take their seat.

Selvaraj (; 14 January 1938 ‚Äì 20 December 2019) was a Tamil writer from Tamil Nadu, India. He was the author of a number of novels, short stories, and plays in Tamil. He was a lawyer by profession and was involved in various Communist and left leaning writers' organisations like Democratic Writers Association India and the Progressive writers association of Tamil Nadu (TNPWA). He was in the executive committee member of the TNPWA.. He received the Tamil Nadu Government's literary award for the best Novel for 2011 for his work on tannery workers of Southern Tamil Nadu titled \\"Thol\\". He did the field work for Thol for a decade before writing it. The novel was awarded the Sahitya Akademi award for Tamil in 2012. Biography Selvaraj was born to Daniel and Gnanam Ammal in 1938 in Thenkalam, Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu, India. His parents were plantation labourers who worked in the tea plantations in Munnar at the Kerala- Tamil Nadu border. He obtained his B.A degree in Tirunelveli (1959) Hindu College and his law degree in Madras (1962) Madras Law college. His early inspiration came from Maupassant short stories, Dickens and Thomas Hardy's Novels. His Principal in Hindu college Professor Alexandar Gnanamuthu introduced him to Shakespeare and Selvaraj was hooked on good literature for his life. He published his first short story in Janasakthidaily's weekly magazine, the official magazine of Communist Party of India (CPI). During 1957-58, he also published regularly in the progressive literary magazine Shanthi run by T. M. Chidambara Ragunathan, along with Sundara Ramaswamy he was a regular contributor to \\"Shanthi\\". As a writer he was influenced by the Communist ideals of P. Jeevanandham and became a member of the TNPWA. His short stories and novels appeared regularly in literary magazines like Neethi, Semmalar, Kannadasan and Thamarai. His first noted work was the novel Malarum Sarugum (1967) written on the background of the peasant agitation in the Tirunelveli district. It is considered to be the first Dalit novel written in Tamil. He followed it with Thaeneer (1973) which was about the plight of the tea plantation workers. He wrote a number of plays, the most notable of which are yugasangamam (1968) and \\"Paatu Mudiyum Munnae\\" . Yugasangamam was awarded the best play award by Tamil Nadu Government's literary association and is currently a part of the curriculum at the Tamil studies department, Delhi University. \\"Paatu Mudiyum Munnae\\" was staged all over Tamil Nadu by T.K. Balachander troupe and lyrics for the play were penned by Paatukkottai Kalayanasundaram - which led to a close relationship with this legendary poet. He sharpened his writing skills with constant criticism and guidance from Tho.Mu.Si. Raghunathan/Thi.Ka.Sivasankaran/Jeevanandam, In fact when Jeevanandam was the editor of \\"Thamarai\\" D.S was the one editing the magazine behind the scenes. He spent years and years researching his novels before sitting down to pen them. His \\"Thol\\" novel is an apt example of that effort. He spent 10 years researching the novel in Dindigul Tanneries and erstwhile workers in Tanneries before writing it down. \\"Thol\\" was awarded the Tamil Nadu Government Award for the best novel of 2009 and the novel has been given the honour by Sahitya Akademi in 2012. He lived his last years in Dindigul. He was married to Bharathaputri and had three children ( Siddharthan Prabhu, Sarvagan Prabhu, Veda gnana lakshmi all 3 married) . He happily shared his time between writing, his advocate practice and playing with his 5 grand children.

Shortly thereafter, Power began working at the CPL in 1895. Brett, a librarian at the CPL, not only served as Power's mentor during her time there, but also put her in charge of the \\"Junior Alcove\\".

Children's librarianship As the Cleveland Public Library's children's librarian, Power worked to instill in children a love of books and reading. She also sought to debunk the myth that children lacked interest in nonfiction. At the time, people believed that children had to be forced to read nonfiction books. Power believed that with encouragement and when given ample opportunity, children could enjoy nonfiction. To prove her point, Power took age-appropriate nonfiction works from the other library sections and displayed them on the shelves in the children's room. As she expected, the children loved the books. Power graduated from the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh, PA in 1904.Berneis, Regina F. (n.d.) Power, Effie Louise. Miller, Marilyn Lea. (editor).

Over many years, she helped establish curricula for and taught at library schools across the country, including Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Public Library's training program, Columbia University, and City Normal School in Cleveland.

Power's feminist views also came out in her writing, with Florence M. Everson, in their 1928 book, Early Days in Ohio: A story of a pioneer family of the Western Reserve: > \\"Girls can't chop anything.\\" said James scornfully. > \\"They haven't the right swing with their arms,\\" added Alonzo. > \\"Here's one girl that can do as much as any two boys,\\" declared Peggy as > she seized a hatchet, and she swung it with so much vim that James and > Alonzo stood back and gazed at her in open-mouthed wonder.\\" Legacy When the American Library Association sought to create a text book on youth services in children's libraries, they called upon Power to write it. In 1930, the American Library Association published Library Service for Children. This text served as the first publication of its kind and demonstrated Power's preeminence in the field of children's librarianship. After years of producing pamphlets, articles, and book lists, Power was honored with this commission. In 1943, an update to the book was released and the title was changed to Work with Children in Public Libraries. Later years Power worked for the Cleveland Public Library from 1895‚Äì1909 and from 1920 until her retirement in 1937.

The voices of Igor Silin and Olga Tkachenko, according to him, ‚ÄúCalls up Stone Age-old associations, when there weren‚Äôt defined scales to play, in a time when the voice echoed the sound of water, rustle of leaves and peals of thunder...‚Äù Duo Zikr was created in the early 1990s within the walls of ‚ÄúThe Fireflower‚Äù drama school of Igor Silin (Kalinauskas), where Olga Tkachenko was mastering a unique vocal technique based on mantra singing elaborated by Igor. After Igor had realized the natural vocal talent and striking capacity for work of his apprentice he offered Olga to sing a whole performance together. The opening performance of the magic theatre took place in 1993 in St. Petersburg at Smolny Cathedral. The debut of the Duo with no playbills placarded gathered about 1000 spectators! Fifteen compact discs have been made together with the famous Russian sound producer Yuri Morozov, and two albums were cut on vinyl - and symbolically one of them ‚ÄúThe Mystery of the Cup‚Äù became the very last vinyl disk produced by the renowned Soviet record company ‚ÄúMelodia‚Äù. The albums ‚ÄúTo the Beginning of Times‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo the Twilight of Times‚Äù were recorded in France on the invitation of Daniel Kenzo, a European saxophonist. Boris Grebenshikov (mantra), Givan Gasparian (duduk) and the world-known percussion player and Grammy-award-winner Evelyn Glennie (who worked with Bjork) participated in the recording of ‚ÄúPremonitions of the Shooting Star‚Äù - one of recent joint creations of Duo Zikr and sound producer Andrei Samsonov. The music from the latter became a soundtrack for an episode from the movie series about world cultures and religions ‚ÄúIndia in Real Time‚Äù, directed by cinematographer Sergei Debizhev. Soloists of the Magic Theatre of Voice fruitfully cooperated with Sergei Kurekhin and jointly participated in Berlin Independence Days festival in Germany and also took part in the last work of the musician ‚ÄúThe Pop-Mechanics‚Äù called ‚ÄúThree Steps in Rave‚Äù. Mstislav Rastropovich and Galina Vishnevskaya were amazed and deeply moved by the vocal improvisations of Igor and Olga when they came to their concert. When the concert had finished the Duo received ‚Äúblessings‚Äù of these great musicians. The Duo has produced some striking videos which were recognized at various contests. For instance ‚ÄúThe Road to Katmandu‚Äù shot under the direction of Fedor Bondarchuk got the prize at ‚ÄúPokolenie-98‚Äù (‚ÄúGeneration-98‚Äù) music clips festival. Ms. Irina Taymanova, production director and musician, made a 20-minute long movie about duo Zikr called ‚ÄúThe Wandering of Souls‚Äù that received the grand-prix of ‚ÄúThe Velvet Season‚Äù international festival. One rare event when the soloists of the Magic Theatre of Voice sang concrete words instead of spontaneous syllables and sounds was the soundtrack to ‚ÄúThe Song about the Cheese Spirit‚Äù , an animated cartoon by famous fable of Aesop ‚ÄúThe Fox and the Crow‚Äù. Igor and Olga enjoy live concerts where they create more and more new tunes. The Duo has performed concerts in the USA, France, Italy, England, Finland, Slovakia, Israel, Australia and other places around the globe. It has been featured several times at the international sound recording and music market MIDEM in Cannes and Hong Kong. Ms. Tkachenko and Mr. Silin have long history of performing in Roman Catholic Churches and temples where, according to them, ‚ÄúYou can perceive the music of the Duo the best‚Äù. Jim Bessman, special correspondent for BILLBOARD magazine (NY, USA) - ‚ÄúApart from dynamic improvisations making the visitors experience unique feelings, there is one more thing about the Duo. That is an astonishing attraction of the passion in the very voices and the manner of the performing‚Äù. In 2007 Igor and Olga launched an experimental project that later on had grown to a full-scale music band called FireVoices. The sextet of male singers has been learning Duo Zikr‚Äôs unique vocal technique (‚ÄúFreevoice‚Äù) and individually as well as jointly with the duet they have staged over 50 concerts in France, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Cyprus, Russian and Ukraine. Like their founders the band performs a capella, but they can use music instruments for the shows as well. The FireVoices perform not just as a music band, but also as a theater. They have staged some drama plays (‚ÄúFall in Love‚Äù by Lesya Ukrainka‚Äôs novels, ‚ÄúTonight‚Äù a modern interpretation of two classical pieces - Romeo & Juliette and West Side Story, ‚ÄúJesus Christ Super Star‚Äù variation of Webber‚Äôs musical).  Biography Olga Tkachenko= Olga completed the course at Kyiv-based Institute of Dramatic Art named after Karpenko-Kary. Joined the theater in kyiv and worked there for some time. Meeting with Igor Kalinauskas defined her further destiny. In the beginning she used to take part in the dramatic plays of Igor's drama studio called the Fireflower. While her work there Olga mastered a unique technique. =Igor Silin= Igor Kalinauskas (Silin is his stage-name) graduated with honors from the drama school named after Schukin, Directing faculty, in Moscow. He used to work as a director in Minsk, Astrakhan, Izhevsk, Moscow, Kyiv having produced 68 plays altogether. Igor is the author of a unique psychotechnique initially elaborated for actors and later on widely applied in many areas. 1000 Friends of Duo Zikr club The crowdfunding club was established in late 2016 as an attempt to help duo Zikr's concert managers throughout Europe to pool funds together and ensure as many events as possible!

Unlike a flat-space black hole, there is a largest possible de Sitter black hole, which is the Nariai spacetime. The Nariai limit has no singularities, the cosmological and black hole horizons have the same area, and they can be mapped to each other by a discrete reflection symmetry in any causal patch.  Introduction  In general relativity, space-times can have black hole event horizons and also cosmological horizons. The de Sitter‚ÄìSchwarzschild solution is the simplest solution which has both.  Metric  The metric of any spherically symmetric solution in Schwarzschild form is: :: ds^2 = - f(r) dt^2 + {dr^2 \\\\over f(r)} + r^2(d\\\\theta^2 + \\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\phi^2) \\\\, The vacuum Einstein equations give a linear equation for ∆í(r), which has as solutions: :: f(r)=1-2a/r \\\\, :: f(r)= 1 - b r^2 \\\\, The first is a zero stress energy solution describing a black hole in empty space time, the second (with b positive) describes de Sitter space with a stress-energy of a positive cosmological constant of magnitude 3b. Superposing the two solutions gives the de Sitter‚ÄìSchwarzschild solution: :: f(r)= 1- {2a\\\\over r} - b r^2 \\\\, The two parameters a and b give the black hole mass and the cosmological constant respectively. In d + 1 dimensions, the inverse power law falloff in the black hole part is d ‚àí 2\\\\. In 2 + 1 dimensions, where the exponent is zero, the analogous solution starts with 2 + 1 de Sitter space, cuts out a wedge, and pastes the two sides of the wedge together to make a conical space. The geodesic equation ::g_{aj} \\\\ddot{x}^j + \\\\left( \\\\partial_i g_{aj} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\partial_a g_{ij} \\\\right) \\\\dot{x}^j \\\\dot{x}^i = 0 \\\\, gives ::\\\\ddot{r} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{- f'(r)}{f(r)} \\\\dot{r}^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} f(r) f'(r) \\\\dot{t}^2 \\\\- r f(r) \\\\dot{\\\\theta} - r f(r) \\\\text{sin}^2 \\\\theta \\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2 = 0 for the radial, and ::\\\\ddot{t} + \\\\frac{1}{f(r)} f'(r) \\\\dot{t} \\\\dot{r} = 0 for the time component.  Horizon properties  The de Sitter space is the simplest solution of Einstein's equation with a positive cosmological constant. It is spherically symmetric and it has a cosmological horizon surrounding any observer, and describes an inflating universe. The Schwarzschild solution is the simplest spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant, and it describes a black hole event horizon in otherwise empty space. The de Sitter‚ÄìSchwarzschild space-time is a combination of the two, and describes a black hole horizon spherically centered in an otherwise de Sitter universe. An observer which hasn't fallen into the black hole, and which can still see the black hole despite the inflation, is sandwiched between the two horizons. One natural question to ask is whether the two horizons are different kinds of objects or whether they are fundamentally the same. Classically the two types of horizon look different. A black hole horizon is a future horizon, things can go in, but don't come out. The cosmological horizon in a Big Bang type cosmology is a past horizon, things come out, but nothing goes in. But in a semi-classical treatment, the de Sitter cosmological horizon can be thought of as absorbing or emitting depending on the point of view. Similarly, for a black hole that has been around for a long time, the horizon can be thought of as emitting or absorbing depending on whether you take the point of view of infalling matter or outgoing Hawking radiation. Hawking argued based on thermodynamics that the past horizon of a white hole is in fact physically the same as the future horizon of a black hole, so that past and future horizons are physically identical. This was elaborated by Susskind into black hole complementarity, which states that any interior parts of a black hole solution, in either the past and future horizon interpretation, can be holographically related by a unitary change of basis to the quantum mechanical description of the horizon itself. The Nariai solution is the limit of the largest black hole in a space which is de Sitter at large distances, it has two horizons, the cosmological de Sitter horizon and a Schwarzschild black hole horizon. For small mass black holes, the two are very different--- there is a singularity at the center of the black hole, and there is no singularity past the cosmological horizon. But the Nariai limit considers making the black hole bigger and bigger, until its event horizon has the same area as the cosmological de Sitter horizon. At this point, the space-time becomes regular, the black hole singularity runs off to infinity, and the two horizons are related by a space-time symmetry. In the Nariai limit, the black hole and de Sitter horizon can be interchanged just by changing the sign of the coordinate z. When there is additional matter density, the solution can be thought of as an Einstein spherical universe with two antipodal black holes. Whichever black hole becomes larger becomes the cosmological horizon.  Nariai solution  Starting with de Sitter‚ÄìSchwarzschild: :: ds^2 = - f(r) \\\\, dt^2 + {dr^2 \\\\over f(r)} + r^2(d\\\\theta^2 + \\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\phi^2) \\\\, with :: f(r) = 1 - {2a\\\\over r} - b r^2 \\\\, The two parameters a and b give the black hole mass and the cosmological constant respectively. In higher dimensions, the power law for the black hole part is faster. When a is small, ∆í(r) has two zeros at positive values of r, which are the location of the black hole and cosmological horizon respectively. As the parameter a increases, keeping the cosmological constant fixed, the two positive zeros come closer. At some value of a, they collide. Approaching this value of a, the black hole and cosmological horizons are at nearly the same value of r. But the distance between them doesn't go to zero, because ∆í(r) is very small between the two zeros, and the square root of its reciprocal integrates to a finite value. If the two zeros of ∆í are at R + Œµ and R ‚àí Œµ taking the small Œµ limit while rescaling r to remove the Œµ dependence gives the Nariai solution. The form of ∆í near the almost-double-zero in terms of the new coordinate u given by r = R + u is: :: f(r)= {u^2 - \\\\epsilon^2\\\\over R^2}\\\\, The metric on the causal patch between the two horizons reduces to :: ds^2 = -(R^2-z^2) \\\\, dt^2 + {dz^2\\\\over (R^2- z^2)} + R^2 \\\\, d\\\\Omega^2 \\\\, which is the metric of dS_2 \\\\times S_2. This form is local for an observer sandwiched between the black hole and the cosmological horizon, which reveal their presence as the two horizons at z = ‚àíR and z = R respectively. The coordinate z can be replaced by a global coordinate for the 1 + 1-dimensional de Sitter space part, and then the metric can be written as: :: dS^2 = - dt^2 + \\\\cosh^2 t \\\\, dx^2 + R^2 \\\\, d\\\\Omega^2\\\\, In these global coordinates, the isotropy of de Sitter space makes shifts of the coordinate x isometries, so that it is possible to identify x with x + A, and make the space dimension into a circle. The constant-time radius of the circle expands exponentially into the future and the past, and this is Nariai's original form. Rotating one of the horizons in Nariai space makes the other horizon rotate in the opposite sense. This is a manifestation of Mach's principle in self-contained causal patches, if the cosmological horizon is included as \\"matter\\", like it's symmetric counterpart, the black hole.  Hawking temperature  The temperature of the small and large horizon in the de Sitter‚ÄìSchwarzschild can be calculated as the period in imaginary time of the solution, or equivalently as the surface gravity near the horizon. The temperature of the smaller black hole is relatively larger, so there is heat flow from the smaller to the larger horizon. The quantity which is the temperature of the black hole is hard to define, because there is no asymptotically flat space to measure it relative to.  Curvature  The non- zero components of the Ricci curvature tensor for the de Sitter‚ÄìSchwarzschild metric are :: R_{tt} = \\\\frac{1}{2} f(r) \\\\left( 2 \\\\frac{f'(r)}{r} + f(r)\\\\right) \\\\, :: R_{rr} = - \\\\frac{2 f'(r) + r f(r)}{2r f(r)} \\\\, :: R_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} = 1-f(r) - r f'(r) \\\\, :: R_{\\\\phi\\\\phi} = -\\\\sin^2(\\\\theta) \\\\left(-1 + f(r) + r f'(r)\\\\right) \\\\, and the Ricci curvature scalar :: R = \\\\frac{2-2f(r)-4rf'(r) -r^2 f(r)}{r^2} \\\\, See also * de Sitter space * Anti-de Sitter space * de Sitter universe * AdS/CFT correspondence  References  Category:Exact solutions in general relativity Category:Riemannian geometry ","title":"De Sitter‚ÄìSchwarzschild metric"},{"id":"22864896","text":"Saint Domnina is venerated as a Christian martyr by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

He was the second son of Duke Bolko I of Opole by his wife Agnes, probably a daughter of Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. Life At the time of his father's death in 1313, Bolko II and his youngest brother Albert inherited the Duchy of Opole as co-rulers; but because at that time both were probably minors, they were placed under the care of their older brother, Boles≈Çaw the Elder. Bolko II assumed full government over his domains in 1323, and made the formal division of the Duchy with his brother Albert: he received Strzelce Opolskie and Bolko II retained the main city of Opole. Thanks to his marriage to Elisabeth, daughter of Duke Bernard of ≈öwidnica, Bolko II had a temporary close connection with the Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high (paternal grandfather of his wife). However, this alliance was short-lived: on 5 April 1327 in Wroc≈Çaw, he paid homage to King John of Bohemia; he was the last Silesian Duke who became a vassal of Bohemia. During his rule in Opole, Bolko II focused on the economical development of his domains. He introduced German laws (see Magdeburg Law) in the villages; also, he supported trade and took care of the state of roads, in order to maintain the safety of travelers. The good economy of his Duchy was used by Bolko II to obtain more lands: in 1351 he bought the towns of Byczyna and Kluczbork from Duke Wenceslaus I of Legnica and the district of S≈Çawiƒôcice from Duke Boles≈Çaw of Bytom. Bolko II was particularly attached to the Franciscan monastery of Opole. Inside the monastery, he built the Chapel of St. Anna, which became the Family vault of the Dukes of Opole. When Bolko II died on 21 June 1356, he was buried there. Marriage and issue By 6 May 1326, Bolko II married Elisabeth (ca. 1315 ‚Äì 8/9 February 1348), daughter of Duke Bernard of ≈öwidnica. They had seven children:According to old chronicles, Bolko II remarried after the death of his wife Elisabeth. The name of his second wife was possibly Margareta, and together they had a daughter, called Agnes, later wife of Margrave Jobst of Moravia, later King of Germany. However, modern historians have debated (and even denied in some cases) the existence of the alleged second wife and daughter of Bolko II. According to the latest researches, this Agnes could be the same as Elisabeth, daughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk and first (if the existence of Agnes is believed) wife of Jobst. The confusion was in the fact that Elisabeth probably also used the name Agnes (Elisabeth-Agnes), a custom which wasn't unusual at that time (for example, Viola of Cieszyn or Richenza of Poland, later Queens of Bohemia, changed their names to Elisabeth after their marriages; see their Wikipedia articles).

Her husband was a pagan. Domnina was arrested by soldiers for her adherence to the Christian religion.

Like all bryozoans, they filter feed by means of an extensible \\"crown\\" of ciliated tentacles called a lophophore. They live in colonies, each of which consists of clones of the founding member. Unlike those of some marine bryozoans, phylactolaemate colonies consist of only one type of zooid, the feeding forms known as autozooids. These are supported by an unmineralized \\"exoskeleton\\" made of gelatinous material or protein, secreted by the zooids. The class contains only one extant order, Plumatellida. Statoblast of Plumatella repens Phylactolaemate colonies reproduce sexually, and each member is a simultaneous hermaphrodite that functions as both male and female. They also reproduce asexually by a method that is unique among bryozoans and enables a colony's lineage to survive the variable and uncertain conditions of freshwater environments. Throughout summer and autumn they produce disc-shaped statoblasts, masses of cells that function as \\"survival pods\\" rather like the gemmules of sponges. Statoblasts form on the funiculus (cord) connected to the parent's gut, which nourishes them. As they grow, statoblasts develop protective bivalve-like shells made of chitin. When they mature, some types stick to the parent colony, some fall to the bottom, some contain air spaces that enable them to float, and some remain in the parent's cystid (outer casing) to re-build the colony if it dies. Statoblasts can remain dormant for considerable periods, and while dormant can survive harsh conditions such as freezing and desiccation. They can be transported across long distances by animals, floating vegetation, currents and winds. When conditions improve, the valves of the shell separate and the cells inside develop into a zooid that tries to form a new colony. A study estimated that one group of colonies in a patch produced 800,000 statoblasts.

Geography  The town was founded in 1863, making it one of the earliest settlements in the Owens Valley. It was situated in the east of the valley, making it one of the more arid places in the valley. As the name of the town suggests, Chrysopolis had an industry based on gold mining.  History  Original town = Ever since the town was founded, Chrysopolis made its industry and economy based on mining. The area prospered briefly, but the population quickly declined because of both troubles with natives living in the region and its geographic isolation. These troubles were eventually resolved with the construction of a nearby fort, but by the time of its completion, more people were interested in the west side of the Owens Valley and left Chrysopolis behind. Although the town was abandoned, mining persisted in the region. = Mining boom and Chrysopolis = The town was revived in the 1900s, when a boom in mining swept through the region. During this boom, more people got focused on the old Chrysopolis mining area. The event was short-lived, however. It had reached its end by 1910, and again people packed up and left. = Ruins = Most of the town is gone, but there are still several stone walls and structures and some mining tunnels.

It is the only surviving monastic fishery building in England. Fishing was an important source of food for the monks of Glastonbury Abbey. Fishing was carried out in artificial ponds, which were mentioned at Meare in the Domesday Book and from the River Brue and Meare Pool. The present rectangular stone building was constructed by the abbot between 1322 and 1335 for the storage and processing of the fish and as a residence for the chief fisherman. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the building fell into disrepair and it was seriously damaged by fire in the 1880s. Some restoration has been undertaken during the 20th century, including the replacement of the roof in the 1920s. History The fish ponds surrounding the Fish House were recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 when they were tended by ten fishermen. The fishponds, which were connected with drains and gullies were up to long and wide. These were connected to the Meare Pool and the River Brue. At one point 5,000 eels were caught each year. Pike, Bream and \\"white fish\\" were also caught. Meare Pool was formed by water ponding-up behind the raised peat bogs between the Wedmore and the Polden Hills, and coring has shown that it is filled with at least of detritus mud, especially in the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC). Early drainage work was carried out in the later years of the 12th century, with the responsibility for maintaining all the watercourses between Glastonbury and the sea being placed on named individuals among whom were Ralph de Sancta Barbara of Brentmarsh. Its precise boundaries varied according to season, and, over the longer term, as efforts were made to drain the area. The south end was bordered by the high ground that the village of Meare is built upon. The pond would have extended no further west than the current Westhay to Wedmore road, where a shelf of rock formed a natural boundary. To the north lies the Godney ridge. The eastern extent is harder to determine, and it may have gone as far as the site of the Glastonbury Lake Village. The importance of this industry is illustrated by a series of acrimonious disputes between Glastonbury and the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral. The Abbey required fish on Fridays, fast days and during Lent. Drainage of the surrounding area by monks of Glastonbury Abbey had reduced the size of the lake to at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Meare Pool had disappeared from maps by 1749. The current fish house was built between 1322 and 1335 when Adam of Sodbury was the Abbot of Glastonbury who also built the Church of St Mary in the village and the Manor House as his summer residence. It may have replaced a previous abbey building. The upper floor was the abode of the chief fisherman when he visited intermittently and the ground floor was used for storing nets and the salting and preparing fish. Some alterations were made, probably in the 15th century. Meare Pool was drained after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the fish house fell into disrepair. It suffered a fire in the 1880s, which destroyed the roof and gutted the interior. In 1893 some repairs were made to the walls, although the roof was not replaced until work was undertaken by the Ministry of Works in the 1920s, with further conservation being carried out in the 1960s. A piece of timber from the building was subject to dendrochronology testing in an attempt to provide a more specific date for the buildings construction, but the results proved inconclusive. In 1910 the building was inspected by Charles Reed Peers under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 and taken into state guardianship. The fish house is now in the care of English Heritage. Architecture The rectangular Blue Lias stone building has a stone tiled roof. It is long and wide. The ground floor had three rooms, one larger than the others which had a fireplace, and a door in the southern wall. The larger room was the hall and linked by arched doorways to the smaller rooms. There were two rooms on the first floor, which were damaged in the fire of 1884, which also has a small entrance door which was accessed via exterior stone steps which no longer exist. There was also a latrine in a turret which no longer exists. There are small traceried arched windows.

His songs have been recorded by country music artists including Kenny Chesney, Carrie Underwood, Faith Hill, and Keith Urban. Outside of country, he has also written with rock and pop stars such as Kylie Minogue, Roger Daltrey, David Archuleta, James Morrison, James Blunt, Jackson Browne, James Bay (singer), and James Arthur as well as rapper Eminem. Early career Steve first began playing music at the age of 10 when his family relocated from Scotland to South Africa. He was just 17 when Miriam Makeba, the queen of African music, recorded his song \\"I Still Long for You\\". Lucky Dube then recorded \\"Khululeka\\" which he had co-written in an African band called Friends First. Steve then moved to London and joined World Party led by the influential Karl Wallinger. After a year-long tour, he signed his own deal with Arista. He also worked with pop star Robbie Williams, playing guitar and singing on Robbie's 1997, 1998 and 2000 albums, as well as Joe Cocker's No Ordinary World. In 2000, Steve formed his own band called UnAmerican. The group recorded its Universal/Estupendo debut album in Memphis and went on the road opening for Neil Young and Crazy Horse and The Who. During that time, Steve co-wrote songs with The Who's lead singer Roger Daltrey. He produced one of the songs called \\"A Second Out\\" which appeared on Daltrey's solo CD in 2004. UnAmerican then signed with Lost Highway and recorded their second album but it was never released. Songwriting career In 2001, Steve had the opportunity to write with country songwriter Craig Wiseman in London. He was then invited to a writer retreat in Nashville put together by BMG music publishing. That was where Steve, Craig and Naoise Sheridan co-wrote \\"Young\\", which became a huge hit for Kenny Chesney the following year. During that same visit to Nashville, Steve's UnAmerican songs came to the attention of Faith Hill, who recorded \\"If This Is the End\\" and \\"Wicked\\" for her three million selling CD Cry of 2002. From there Steve continued to have successful singles on country radio: Tim McGraw's \\"My Old Friend\\" and Brooks and Dunn's \\"That's What It's All About\\". \\"Summertime\\" soon followed and was another massive Kenny Chesney hit co- written by Steve, and then came the No. 1 single \\"Just A Dream\\" by artist Carrie Underwood. His regular trips to Nashville have resulted in four number 1 singles and cuts on more than 50 million albums worldwide. Steve never left his pop/rock roots as his success writing for that genre continued. He co- wrote four songs on pop/R&B; sensation James Morrison's 2007 release called Undiscovered. He also wrote \\"One of the Brightest Stars\\" with James Blunt for the 2007 All the Lost Souls album and had two songs on pop star David Archuleta's debut album in 2008. Steve has co-written Keith Urban's No. 1 single \\"Only You Can Love Me This Way\\".

History  The British Milksheep originally was known as the Alderbred and is a breed of domesticated sheep developed by Lawrence Alderson and his wife Mary in Wiltshire and Northumberland. It was exported to several countries including Hungary, France and Greece, and from there other neighbouring countries. It now can be found mainly in the UK, Hungary and Canada, although the population in Britain was decimated during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. The exact composition of the breed has never been declared but it was based on high-performance animals in existing flocks of Dorset Horn, Bluefaced Leicester and Eastrip Prolific sheep kept by the Alderson family. Additional individual animals were selected from Lleyn, Texel and East Friesian breeds. Subsequent selection was based on measures of productivity, without regard for uniformity of appearance. A standardised breed type emerged gradually as the blending process continued. The animals were exposed to rugged conditions in the upper Pennines in northern England to develop robustness and adaptability. Progeny testing from the initial stages laid the foundation for continuous genetic improvement. Initially, total ownership of females of the breed was retained by the family and only rams were sold, but groups of females were released to other breeders in 1981. Numbers of flocks and animals increased rapidly and there were more than 5,000 breeding ewes by the mid-1980s with flocks widespread in Britain. A flock book was published in 1986. As the name of the breed suggests, it is a prolific milk producer, and several large dairy flocks were established. However, it is a robust, dual-purpose sheep rather than a specialist dairy breed. It is known for its extremely high prolificacy, and rams are used to sire high-performance crossbred daughters. The quality of its carcase and wool are extra beneficial traits. In all countries outside Britain, the British Milksheep is used more as a dairying breed with dual-purpose qualities, but it is used also in most countries as a crossing sire; in Britain on hill and longwool breeds, in France in the Alps and Pyrenees on mountain breeds, in Greece on Chios dairy ewes, and in Hungary on the predominant Merino population. In France it has contributed to the development of the Boulonnais breed. Characteristics The British Milksheep is a white-faced, clean- headed, polled sheep, with a large robust body that does well in conformation. At maturity, rams weigh and ewes on average. They have good carcase characteristics. In comparative trials in Hungary for meat production, crossbred lambs sired by British Milksheep had a superior carcase grading, a higher killing-out percentage than crosses sired by Ile de France, Suffolk and Mutton Merino rams, and the meat was the most tender as measured by shear force. = Milking Characteristics = It is the most prolific British breed. Mature ewes achieve an average litter size of more than 3.00 and this advantage carries through to lambs weaned per ewe. Before the breed settled to the desired level of prolificacy, some remarkable records were achieved in the early stages of the project, with sextuplets being not uncommon and one ewe achieving a lifetime record of 44 lambs in 10 crops. Comparative trials carried out by the Scottish Agricultural College in the 1990s showed that halfbred ewes sired by the British Milksheep achieved a level of productivity 11% higher than halfbreds sired by Bluefaced Leicester and Border Leicester rams, and 26% higher than those sired by Bleu du Maine and Rouge de l‚ÄôOuest rams. Average milk yield depends on the standard of management of the flock and can vary from 250 to more than 400 litres in a 210-day lactation, with 6% fat and 6% protein. Some pure flocks continue to be used for dairying and produce milk for consumers with allergy to cows‚Äô milk, ice-cream, and speciality cheeses in northern England and Canada. There are claims that ewes produce to of milk in a 300-day lactation with a 5.5 to 9.5% fat content but those claims have not been verified. In comparative trials for milk yield in Hungary, using the local Merino population with a milk yield of 30-50 litres per lactation, British Milksheep crosses proved superior to crosses by Lacaune and Awassi rams. They yielded 90-130 litres compared with 60-80 litres from Lacaune crosses and 80-105 litres from Awassi crosses. = Wool Characteristics = Ewes produce and rams fleece with a spinning count of 50 to 54s.

Three people died in the crash after a signalman's error routed a small freight train into the path of an express passenger train which slowed but could not stop before colliding with it. The express was a Birmingham Pullman service travelling from Birmingham Snow Hill to London Paddington, having departed at 1pm. The freight train movement in Dorridge station (formerly called Knowle and Dorridge) was a routine shunting manoeuvre, one that often occurred both before or after the express train had passed through the station. The Pullman was 9 coaches long, and was hauled by an 11-month-old diesel hydraulic Class 52 \\"Western\\" locomotive, No. 1040 Western Queen. The freight train was formed (from the London end) of a hopper wagon, a pannier tank steam locomotive, a brake van, an empty bogie flatcar, and a bogie flatcar loaded with Land Rover vehicles. The crash occurred in fine dry weather, at around 1.10 pm. The express was travelling at its usual speed of around approaching the station when the driver noticed the Knowle and Dorridge distant signal at caution. He applied the brakes but was only able to reduce speed to , before colliding with the freight train which was stationary on the same line, having stopped when the signalman showed the driver a red flag. The distant signal was only from Knowle's up main home signal, insufficient distance for the express to stop from . The locomotive struck the loaded flat car crushing the cab, but without derailing. Two freight cars were derailed, with the rest pushed down the track. All four men on the freight train, the driver, fireman, shunter and guard, managed to jump clear before the collision. The driver, co-driver and second man on the express locomotive all died. It was found that the signalman at Knowle and Dorridge signal box had forgotten he had signalled that the up main line was clear for the express train and allowed the freight train onto the same line, in its path. On receiving a \\"train approaching\\" signal for the express, he realised his mistake, but was only able to alert the freight train by red flag. Although it braked to a halt, it could not be cleared from the main line in time to avoid the collision. As a contributory factor to the crash, it was found that the signalman, in clearing the express, had disregarded a standing order known as Regulation 4A, governing the safe operation of signals in sections of track where the minimum stopping distance for trains was shorter than the distance between signals. He had given \\"line clear\\" for the express train to the preceding signal box before receiving the required clearance from the following signal box. Instead, he should have sent a \\"blocking back inside home signal\\" message to Bentley Heath, the preceding signal box, so that the express train could have been slowed in plenty of time by the Bentley Heath distant signal at caution. However, it was not determined at the enquiry whether the signalman had cleared the express before or after allowing the conflicting freight movement. This may have been academic if the express had been cleared before the freight train was permitted to foul the up main line, even if Regulation 4A had been obeyed. The express train was normally formed by a Blue Pullman multiple unit, an experimental type of new luxury train built for pullman services, but this regular train had to be taken out of service and replaced by the stand-by diesel hydraulic. One of the drivers killed in the accident was Ernie Morris, one of the first drivers to be certified on the Blue Pullman sets, and who had featured in the 1962 British Transport Film \\"Lets Go To Birmingham\\", a driver's eye view of the Blue Pullman sets on a run from London Paddington to Birmingham Snow Hill. Two drivers were required on this working and the other driver killed was Sid Bench. The second man, also killed, was David Corkery who was only on the train to cover for the rostered man who had gone sick. David left a widow and two young children.

It was built in the 14th or 15th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. It was originally built as a wool store for Hinton Priory at nearby Hinton Charterhouse and to accommodate travellers and merchants coming to the annual wool fairs that were held in the village from the late 13th century until 1902. Hinton Priory was one of the ten medieval Carthusian houses (charterhouses) in England. It was first established at Hatherop in 1222 by William Longspee, Earl of Salisbury. The monks disliked the location, and on Longspee's death in 1226 they petitioned his countess for a new site to achieve greater solitude. She gave them her manors of Hinton Charterhouse and Norton St Philip and the new house was consecrated at Hinton Charterhouse in May 1232. A licence to sell alcohol at The George is claimed from 1397, which may have been a local licence from the Prior of Hinton Priory as Governmental licences for alehouses were only introduced in 1552. In the 15th century the timber-framed upper floors were added. The inn became part of the stage coach route between London and South West England. On 12 June 1668 the noted diarist Samuel Pepys, with his wife and servants, passed through Norton St Philip on their way to Bath from Salisbury. The inn was later used as the headquarters of Monmouth's army, during the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, after his retreat from Bath. In the aftermath of the failed rebellion Judge Jeffreys used the George Inn as a courtroom and conducted 12 executions on the village common, as part of the Bloody Assizes. In 1998 a major programme of restoration was undertaken, funded by the Wadworth Brewery, which included extensive archaeological investigations into the history of the building. This showed that part of the building had been demolished in the 17th century and dendrochronology showed that the roof timbers had been replaced in around 1431. Roof repairs included removing all 29,750 stone slates, 70% of which were able to be reused. The building has been used as a setting for films such as The Remains of the Day, Tom Jones, and The Canterbury Tales, as well as in the television adaptations of Persuasion by Jane Austen and Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe.

It was pioneered in 1851 by William Nobles, who discovered an easy shortcut between the Applegate Trail in Nevada and the Lassen Trail in California. The trail was extensively used until the 1870s, when it was superseded by railroads. Discovery and establishment The main trail to California in the 1840s was the California Trail, which followed the Humboldt River in Nevada, then the Truckee River, and over the Donner Pass in California. A northern variation was pioneered by the Applegate brothers in 1846, using a more northerly route that connected with destinations in Oregon. Peter Lassen established a variant route that passed Lassen Peak on the way to the Sacramento area. Lassen scouted the area of Honey Lake with William H. Nobles for a legendary \\"Gold Lake\\", but having failed, they parted company, with Nobles continuing to the east and accidentally scouting a shorter, easier trail than Lassen's. Nobles, born in New York in 1816, had moved to Minnesota in 1841 to work as a carpenter, then as a carpenter and wagon-maker. By 1851 he had moved on to California. When Nobles returned to California from his expedition with Lassen, he showed a party of businessmen the route for a fee of $2000. With the subscribers vouching for the usefulness of the route, he returned to Minnesota in 1853 to promote the route, marrying in Illinois along the way. The Minnesota legislature commissioned Nobles to present the route to Congress in Washington. Nobles' efforts persuaded Congress to appropriate $300,000 for an expedition along the route, led by Frederick W. Lander, who prepared a favorable report in February 1861. The route became known as the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road. Nobles was elected to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and died in St. Paul in 1876. The trail was briefly considered for a railroad route. Its popularity contributed to the founding of Susanville and Redding. Historic designation The section of trail within the boundaries of Lassen Volcanic National Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1975. The section within the park is maintained as a hiking trail. The trail has two California Historical Landmark markers: #675 marks a stopping place along the Noble Emigrant Trail that William Nobles established near the present-day city of Susanville, while #677 marks the spot where Peter Lassen first saw Honey Lake on October 4, 1850, while on his search for \\"Gold Lake\\". Lassen Volcanic National Park The trail within the park starts in the northeast corner, passing the edge of the Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds, then skirting Prospect Peak. Crossing Badger Flats and passing through the Devastated Area associated with the May 21, 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak. The trail parallels the Lassen Park Road, then passes between the Chaos Crags and Table Mountain, across Sunflower Flat and over Nobles Pass, following the edge of the Chaos Jumbles. The trail leaves the northwest corner of the park near Manzanita Lake.

After the war, he was tried and imprisoned for war crimes committed there under his command. Early life, World War I and Interbellum Andrae was born in 1888 and joined the army in 1906. During World War I, he served with the 56th Field-Artillery-Brigade, in the Staffs of the 2nd Army, the 25th Infantry Division, the 9th Landwehr Division and the XVI Army Corps. After the end of World War I, he remained in the Reichswehr, from which he retired in 1920. He then moved to the security police, where he stayed until 1935 when he re-entered the army. In August 1936, he joined the then newly established Luftwaffe. World War II Serving in the Luftwaffe as the Commander of Air Region Staffs 17 (Poland), 300 (Denmark), Balkans, and Crete, Andrae took part in the campaigns against Poland, Denmark, the Balkans and Crete, respectively. In June 1941, he succeeded Kurt Student as the Commander-in-Chief of \\"Fortress Crete\\". Under his command, thousands of civilian residents of Crete were tortured or executed.

Mechanism It consists of two nodes, one resides on the internal the local area network where it can access the desired server, and the other node runs outside of the local area network, where the client can access it. These nodes are respectively called CC (Connect-Connect) and LL (Listen-Listen). The reason behind naming the nodes are the fact that Connect-Connect node initiates two connections one to the Listen-Listen node and one to the actual server. The Listen-Listen node, however, passively Listens on two TCP/IP ports, one to receive a connection from CC and the other one for an incoming connection from the client. The CC node, which runs inside the network will establish a control connection to the LL, and waiting for LL's signal to open a connection to the internal server. Upon receiving a client connection LL will signal the CC node to connect the server, once done CC will let LL know of the result and if successful LL will keep the client connection and thus the client and server can communicate while CC and LL both relay the data back and forth. Use cases One of the cases where it can be very useful is to connect to a desktop machine behind a firewall running VNC, which would make the desktop remotely accessible over the network and beyond the firewall. Another useful scenario would be to create a VPN using PPP over SSH, or even simply using SSH to connect to an internal Unix based server.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. By 2017, the county had begun plans to construct a new courthouse because of security concerns with the current one. A new courthouse began construction in 2019; after completion, the old courthouse was expected to be converted into county administrative offices. Several earlier proposals had been made for a new courthouse. Overview The two-story Italianate building, made of stone, is crowned by a small copper-domed cupola. The building is sited on a hilltop near the commercial section of Ely, with the city's middle school, library, senior citizen center, several houses, and a park in close proximity. A World War I memorial plaque is located in front of the courthouse, and lists 35 White Pine County residents who died during the war. The courthouse was built in 1908, and replaced a temporary wood frame courthouse that itself replaced a structure that burned in 1885 in the former county seat of Hamilton. A copper boom allowed the county to invest in the present substantial two-story structure, designed by George T. Beardslee and built by R.E. Dodson and G.W. Weller for $49,688. A two-story jail was added to the rear in 1925. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 11, 1986. A seating area was added outside the courthouse in 2004. By June 2005, the building had received new paint and carpeting. Security risks and new courthouse proposals By the mid-1960s, the jail and a sheriff's office located inside the courthouse were deemed as no longer secure. A new courthouse was proposed in 1966, as part of a civic complex that would include other buildings. As of 1967, the county commission favored a new courthouse complex, but the project did not materialize because of concerns about square footage and construction costs. A structure known as the Public Safety building was later opened elsewhere in Ely in 1976, to house the jail and sheriff facilities. In 2005, a funding bill to construct a new $11 million judicial facility was rejected by the Nevada Legislature. In September 2006, the county commission voted unanimously to spend $100,000 to $120,000 to hire two bailiffs for the courthouse, a recommendation that came from Seventh Judicial Judge Dan L. Papez, who worked in the building. Prior to that time, deputies from the county police department worked as bailiffs during trials and were also supposed to visit the courthouse twice on days when trials were not being held. However, because of other duties, deputies did not always have time to visit the courthouse. Papez also noted that some of Nevada's most dangerous criminals were kept at Ely State Prison and were sometimes brought to the courthouse. The Ely Times, the local newspaper, wrote at the time, \\"Security at the courthouse now is haphazard at best and non- existent the majority of the time. While there is a metal detector at the top of the stairs on the second floor, all of the courthouse doors stay unlocked throughout the day. And people who take the elevator to the second floor avoid the single metal detector.\\" Papez planned to start having all entrances locked during the day, aside from the main entrance. In February 2007, Nevada governor Jim Gibbons and State Senator Bob Beers of Las Vegas toured the courthouse and joined a list of judges and lawmakers who supported the construction of a new, $14 million judicial complex. State funding was required for a new courthouse, but lawmakers had concerns about the ability of the county to pay for future expenses at the new facility. To alleviate these concerns, the county planned to introduce a draft proposal which would pay for the new facility's daily operations in the form of a pre-funded $4 million courthouse trust. In March 2007, Nevada Supreme Court Chief Justice William Maupin called the courthouse \\"one of the most dangerous locations in this state,\\" saying, \\"Nevada's most dangerous criminal defendants, those incarcerated at the Ely State Prison, frequently appear in court in Ely and sit in a witness box that is within arm's reach of juror positions one and two.\\" In his proposed budget, Gibbons included $6.5 million for a new county judicial facility. State lawmakers reduced the amount to $1.5 million, to pay for updated security measures at the current courthouse. In June 2007, five Democrat state lawmakers from Clark County eliminated funding for the courthouse entirely. In October 2007, the United States Marshals Service completed a federal study of the building, as requested by Papez. Vincent Freiburger of the U.S. Marshals Service wrote in his report, \\"Not only is the site location unacceptable, but the facility will never meet minimum security standards based upon design and infrastructure issues.\\" At the time, Justice Court proceedings were held in the building's small basement, which lacked an emergency exit. Plumbing and electrical lines were also exposed throughout the structure. The U.S. Marshals Service report confirmed earlier findings in 2003 by the Nevada Supreme Court's Commission on Rural Courts. Freiburger made a recommendation to the county to find an alternative courthouse location, stating, \\"Should a serious security breach occur, the close proximity could endanger residents and many of the middle school children in the immediate area.\\" The courthouse remained open as there were no other court facilities in the county. In January 2010, Papez said that security had improved at the courthouse and that he felt comfortable being in the building. Papez also said that he and his staff were working to further improve security. In March 2010, the Seventh Judicial District Court banned visitors from carrying weapons inside the building. =New facility= By January 2017, a new courthouse complex was being planned for construction on a different parcel of land in Ely, adjacent to the Public Safety building. The new courthouse was proposed due to the security concerns regarding the old courthouse, where District and Justice Court trials continued to be held. At the time, the first floor was occupied by several county offices, including separate offices for the treasurer and the county clerk. Justice Court proceedings were still being held in the building's basement, and the close proximity between the jury box and inmates who are on trial remained a security concern. A request by the county for $10 million was submitted to the Nevada Legislature to aid in the funding of a new courthouse/jail facility, which was expected to cost a total of $25 million to $30 million. Regarding security concerns, District Attorney Mike Wheable said, \\"A high security inmate whose already serving a life sentence, what does he have to lose? And let's talk about what's going on, outside of the courthouse? You have recess for the middle school kids at the park, mothers and fathers taking their kids to the library and senior citizens meeting up to have lunch at the Senior Center, while here's a full CERT team armed with assault rifles and shotguns, on the perimeter of the building, on the back steps, and on the roof. These two circles are overlapping\\". Ely mayor Melody VanCamp said, \\"The building is in such tough shape that it's not worth the money in trying to make it safe to have prisoners there and bring them in... our courthouse isn't secure enough to have the trials and arraignments. They can't make it secure enough. It's too much hassle, too much trouble.\\" In June 2017, no action was taken on the funding request, leaving the White Pine County Commission to choose between remodeling the courthouse or the city's jail. In September 2017, the USDA Rural Development government agency approved a $9 million loan to the county to help finance a new justice center, including a courthouse. The facility was projected to cost $17.7 million, and was scheduled to begin construction in 2018. The original courthouse was planned to be converted into county administrative offices after the new courthouse facility was completed. In April 2019, the county sought $10 million from the state to help finance construction of the new justice facility, with completion expected between December 2019 and September 2021. The state approved $5 million for the new, two-floor facility in June 2019, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held for it on September 24, 2019.

Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967), was a United States Supreme Court case that held that 'mere evidence' may be seized and held as evidence in a trial. This finding reversed previous Supreme Court decisions such as Boyd v. United States which had held that search warrants may not be used as a means of gaining access to a man's house or office and papers solely for the purpose of making search to secure evidence to be used against him in a criminal or penal proceeding.... Background of the case In the morning of March 17, 1962, an armed man robbed the Diamond Cab Company in Baltimore, Maryland. Two cab drivers followed the man to a house and relayed the information to the police, who arrived quickly. After the police knocked on the door and announced that they were searching for a robber seen entering the house, Mrs. Hayden consented to the search. A search of the premises revealed a gun and clothing, found in a washing machine, that matched the description of the armed man that had been reported by the cab company. Weapons were found in a bathroom that matched the description of those used by the robber. Ammunition for the shotgun was found in Mr Hayden's chest of drawers and ammunition for the handgun under his mattress. Hayden was convicted at a bench trial. During appeals, courts held that the search of the house was valid; the search for weapons that were used in the crime, or could be used against the police was also valid. However, the appellate court held that the clothing was of 'mere evidential' nature, not in plain sight, and this was not properly seized. The police had been in hot pursuit of the robber, and thus were exempt from needing a warrant to search the house. However, under the rules at that time, seizing evidence such as the clothing that fit the description of the fleeing robber would not have been allowed. Suppressing the improperly seized evidence would lead to a new trial under the principle of the fruit of the poisonous tree.

Biography Alfred M√©zi√®res was educated at Metz College and the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He became a teacher at the French School of Athens, and later in Toulouse. He taught foreign literature at the University of Nancy in 1854, and was appointed professor of foreign literature at the Sorbonne in 1861. In 1864, he co-founded the newspaper Le Temps. He served as an army officer in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. He published studies on Shakespeare, Petrarch, Dante and Goethe and was elected to the Academie Francaise on January 29, 1874. In 1874, he entered politics representing Longwy on the General Council of Meurthe-et-Moselle, serving as President of the Council twice, 1889 - 1892 and 1898 - 1906. He was elected to the Assemblee Nationale as the deputy of Meurthe-et-Moselle in 1881 and served until 1898. In 1900, he was elected senator for Meurthe-et-Moselle and in 1906, he became vice president of the Senate army commission. In September 1914, the German army occupied Meziere‚Äôs house in Rehon and held him hostage. On October 3, 1915, he was finally allowed to leave in exchange for a German prisoner, but he died on October 10, 1915. The rue Alfred Mezieres and four nearby schools in Nancy are named after him, as is the College Alfred Mezieres in Jarny.

The Allied forces were victorious, with the Polish II Corps and supporting Allied units capturing the city on 21 April. Background Allied Spring Offensive: Italy 1945, 9 April ‚Äì 2 May. This map shows the advance of the Polish II Corps on Bologna Map of US IV and II Corps breakthrough into the Po valley, April 1945 (this map shows operations in the Bologna region, 14‚Äì21 April 1945, but does not seem to show any operations of non-US troops in the region) In March 1945 the Allies were preparing a new offensive, Operation Buckland, in Northern Italy.Zbigniew Wawer, Zdobycie Bolonii, p.9 The capture of Bologna, an important regional communication hub, was set as a part of that offensive. The Allied forces tasked with this were composed of the US 5th Army (II Corps, South African 6th Armoured Division) and the British 8th Army (which for that part of the theatre, was composed of the V Corps and the Polish II Corps). The German units defending the area were composed of the German 26th Panzer Division of the XIV Panzer Corps, the 1st Parachute Division and the 4th Parachute Division of the I Parachute Corps. German defenses in that region were part of the Army Group C, defending the Paula Line. The morale of the Polish forces was weakened by the outcome of the Yalta Conference which ended on 11 February, where the British and Americans, without consultation with the Poles, had decided to give a major part of the 1921‚Äì1939 Polish territories to the Soviet Union.Zbigniew Wawer, Zdobycie Bolonii, p.8Steven J.

When the Polish commander of II Corps, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, asked for his unit to be withdrawn from the front line, Winston Churchill told him \\"you [the Poles] are no longer needed\\" but the American and British front line commanders‚ÄîGenerals Richard McCreery, Mark Wayne Clark and Field Marshal Harold Alexander‚Äîrequested Anders that the Polish units remain in their positions, as they had no troops to replace them. Anders eventually decided to keep the Polish units engaged.

Tabona, Royal Malta Artillery, 1999 Friendly fire caused casualties as American bombers killed 38 advancing Polish troops on that day. The American and British units engaged the German flanks, while the Polish units broke through to the city. On 10 April, Polish forces pushed the Germans away from the Senio River. From 12‚Äì14 April Polish forces fought the Germans at the Santerno River and captured Imola. From 15‚Äì16 April, the Poles fought at the Sillaro River and the Medicina Canal. On 17 April, the commander of the Eighth Army ordered the Polish forces to continue their push towards Bologna from the east. The town was to be taken initially by the American troops of the Fifth Army advancing from the south.Zbigniew Wawer, Zdobycie Bolonii, p.13 On 21 April the 3rd Carpathian Rifle Brigade of the Polish 3rd Carpathian Infantry Division entered the city, where only isolated German units were still fighting. (Another source attributes the entrance to the Polish 5th Kresowa Division). By 6:15 am the Poles had secured the city, displaying Polish flags from the town hall and the Torre Asinelli tower, the highest tower in the city. The local Italian population welcomed the Poles as their liberators. At 8:00 am, American (South African) tanks arrived in the city, followed by Italian partisans and the \\"Friuli\\" division of the Italian Co-Belligerent Army. Aftermath The Battle of Bologna was the last battle of the Polish II Corps, which was taken out of the front line on 22 April. American and British troops completed their encirclement of the Germans forces north of the Reno River, the 8th Indian Division crossed the Po River and the German forces in Italy capitulated on 29 April. The Polish II Corps, commanded by General Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko, suffered 234 dead and 1,228 wounded out of 55,780 front line personnel. German divisions were left in disarray, and as the end of the war neared, many splintered into small groups in order to retreat across the Po and try to reach the passes into Germany. The 65th Infantry Division lost its commander, Generalmajor Hellmuth Pfeifer in the last days of the war as he tried to make his way north with the remnants of divisional headquarters.

The settlement there began in 1864, as a waystop at Haiwai Meadows on the road between Visalia and the Owens Valley. The stop was run by a man named McGuire and his wife and young son. McGuire's wife and son were killed in an Indian attack while he was away on January 1, 1865. Owens Valley settler militia avenged their deaths, with an attack on the Indian village where the killers had taken refuge, in the Owens Lake Massacre on January 6, 1865. This was one of the last fights in the Owens Valley Indian War. The original settlement site and the Haiwai Meadows are under the water of the Haiwee Reservoir.

In addition to his business interests, Fletcher was involved in Indianapolis's educational and civic development. After his death, one of his farms (Wood Lawn) was developed into an early Indianapolis neighborhood, and Fletcher Place is now a nationally recognized historic district.

Plot The story centers around Deanna Lambert, a 16-year-old girl troubled by social exile and branding rumors. When she was thirteen, her father caught her and her brother's friend, seventeen year old Tommy Webber, having unprotected sex in the back of Tommy's Buick. Word gets around by Tommy, and Deanna is named the 'school slut'. Her father becomes distant and cold towards her, never showing any affection after what he witnessed. Three years later, Deanna still lives in her small hometown of Pacifica, California. Her affair with Tommy Webber is still a popular gossip topic and her older brother, Darren, and his girlfriend, Stacy, now live in their basement with their child, April. Keeping a fantasy of moving out of the house with Darren, April and Stacy in her mind and coming to a happy home, Deanna gets a summer job at a ratty pizza parlor, Picasso's Pizza, while also dealing with inhibited feelings of affection for her best friend, Jason, who is dating her other friend, Lee. As the summer progresses, Deanna's secret love of Jason deepens. She begins to become more and more envious of Lee, especially of Lee's happy home and inner peace. One day, Deanna finds that Stacy fled the house, leaving April behind, and does not return. At the same time, she develops a friendship with her boss at Picasso's, Michael, while working alongside Tommy Webber. One evening, Michael gives Deanna a ride home from work and Deanna's father grows suspicious of Michael's motives. Deanna then lashes out at her father for never again trusting her after he caught Deanna and Tommy in the car, which causes her father to temporarily leave. At the end of the story Deanna reconciles with Lee and Jason (after hanging out with only Jason while Lee was on a weekend trip, which ultimately led to Deanna kissing him and asking him why he never asked her out); Stacy suddenly arrives home (it is revealed that she left only intending to party before returning to motherhood); and Deanna decides to truly move on from the affair she had so long ago. Coincidentally, her father also returns to his family and moves on from the past. The story ends with Deanna explaining to Darren and Stacy (who have found an apartment and are going to move in there with April) that she has worked with Tommy for the whole summer. Stacy promises that, while Deanna cannot move in with them, there will always be a toothbrush and understanding people there for her. Soon, school has begun again, and Deanna, Jason, and Lee are now juniors. They ask her if she is ready for the new year, and although Deanna says that she isn't ready, Lee tells her it's time to begin it. Characters * Deanna - The main character of the book.

Hay (January 12, 1891July 29, 1944) was the owner of the Canton Bulldogs from 1918 through the 1922 season. However, he is mostly recognized for organizing the first meeting of teams that would later form the American Professional Football Association, later called the National Football League. Car salesman After high school in Canton, Hay, at age 18, went to work as an automobile salesman for a local dealership. After several years selling cars, Hay went into the car business for himself. He set up the Ralph E. Hay Motor Company, and sold Jordan Hupmobiles and Pierce-Arrows. Hay became one of the most successful automobile dealers in the state of Ohio. Canton Bulldogs In 1918, at the age of 27, Hay acquired the Canton Bulldogs from Jack Cusack, when Cusack decided to return to Oklahoma and compete in the oil industry. Hay had planned to use the team to help promote his car business and pursue his love of football. At the time the Bulldogs were the top team in the unofficial \\"Ohio League\\", winning championships in 1916 and 1917. The team did not compete much in 1918 due manning issues related to the United States involvement in World War I. However in 1919, the Bulldogs again won the championship. Despite winning a championship, the Bulldogs did not draw well. Not enough fans came to games to pay for the high-priced salaries owed to the players. Hay lost money. To combat the increasing salaries, as well as the issue of players jumping from team to team, Hay sought to form a league. The league idea came from Canton's star halfback, Jim Thorpe, who in turn heard the idea from Rochester Jeffersons owner Leo Lyons during a 1917 match between the Bulldogs and the Jeffs. Formation of the NFL On Friday, August 20, 1920, Hay met in Canton with the managers of the Akron Pros, Cleveland Tigers, and Dayton Triangles to form the American Professional Football Conference. The Akron delegation consisted of Frank Nied and Art Ranney. While Jimmy O'Donnell and Stan Cofall represented Cleveland, and Carl Storck Dayton. At the meeting Hay was elected secretary of the league. He then wrote to every important pro team in the Midwest, including George Halas manager of the Decatur Staleys, inviting them to meet in Canton on Friday, September 17, 1920 at 8:00 pm. Representatives from ten pro teams showed up. Because Hay's office was too small, the meeting was held in his automobile showroom. Some of the owners sat on car running boards due to a lack of seats. The resulting organization operated for two years as the American Professional Football Association before its name was changed to the National Football League in 1922. The ten original franchises were from four states. The Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Tigers, and Dayton Triangles from Ohio; the Hammond Pros and Muncie Flyers from Indiana; the Rochester Jeffersons from New York; and the Rock Island Independents, Decatur Staleys, and Racine Cardinals from Illinois. Four other franchises the Buffalo All-Americans, Chicago Tigers, Columbus Panhandles, and Detroit Heralds would join the league later that year. Hay was asked to become the league's president, however he suggested that Jim Thorpe take the position on the belief that his fame would enhance the league. Bulldogs in the NFL Hay built a strong team in Canton during the early 1920's, signing three future Hall of Famers in tackle Wilbur Henry, tackle Roy \\"Link\\" Lyman, and end Guy Chamberlin. When Chamberlin took over as coach in 1922 from Cap Edwards, the Bulldogs went undefeated and won the NFL championship. However, Hay continued to lose money with the Bulldogs. Before the 1923 season, he sold the team to a group of local businessmen. The Bulldogs went on to win the 1923 NFL Championship and became the first NFL team to win back-to-back league titles. Legacy On April 27, 1961, Canton was selected by the NFL as the site for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The efforts of Hay and the Bulldogs were offered as proof for the shrine to be located in Canton. While Hay has not yet been enshrined in the Hall, the city of Canton put up a plaque on the Bow Federal building in downtown Canton, the site where Ralph's automobile showroom once stood. The plaque recognizes Ralph Hay and Jim Thorpe, and the historical meeting on September 17, 1920 that saw the birth of the NFL. In 1988, the Professional Football Researchers Association established the Ralph Hay Award which is awarded for \\"lifetime achievement in pro football research and historiography.\\" Family Hay was married to Esther Becker, who had previously served as his secretary.

The copper belt in Katanga, the diamond mines in Sierra Leone, Angola, and Botswana are well known for their abundance and rich produce, albeit, also notorious for their level of corruption and links to rebel movements. The RUF (Revolutionary United Front) and the blood diamonds used to supply these rebel factions with arms is one such example.

(2001) 'Does Oil Hinder Democracy,' World Politics, 53(3) have talked about the 'scourge of raw materials', large quantities of rare raw materials putting Africa under heavy pressures and leading to wars and slow development. Despite these abundance of natural resources, claims suggest that many Western nations like the United States, Canada, Australia, France and the United Kingdom often exploit Africa's natural resources today, causing most of the value and money from the natural resources to go to the West rather than Africa, further causing the poverty in Africa.

The cultivar was introduced into Great Britain in 1979. The plant is a compact, bushy shrub with light pink camellia-like flowers. It is disease resistant and blooms continuously from June to mid- October. History Cants of Colchester is the oldest firm of commercial rose growers in Great Britain. The company was founded by Benjamin Cant in 1765 under the name, 'Benjamin R. Cant & Sons' and was located in Mile End, now a northern suburb of Colchester. The nursery originally sold a variety of plants, seeds, bulbs and trees. With the rise in popularity of roses in the mid 1800s, Benjamin R. Cant (1827-1900), initiated a rose breeding program at the company in 1875. By 1880, Cant had become an award winning rose exhibitor in England. Cant's nephew, Frank Cant (1857-1928), split from the family firm and established his own nursery in Colchester in the early 1880s. The two Cant families became fierce competitors. The rivalry between the two nurseries lasted until the 1960s, when their descendants decided to merge the two family businesses into one company. The 'Benjamin R Cant & Sons' of Mile End Colchester and 'Frank Cant & Company' of Stanway, Essex became the 'Cants of Colchester' under the leadership of Cant family descendant, Roger Pawsey. Cants of Colchester has introduced several popular rose varieties, including Rosa 'Just Joey', Rosa 'Alpine Sunset' and Rosa 'Goldstar'. Rosa 'English Miss' Pawsey developed the new rose variety, 'English Miss' in 1977. The rose was named in honour of Pawsey's three-year-old daughter Sally-Anne. It was introduced into Britain in 1979. The cultivar is a hybrid of Rosa 'Dearest' and Rosa 'The Optimist'. 'English Miss' was used to hybridize two child plants: Rosa 'Colchester Beauty', (Pawsey, before 1992) and Rosa 'Our Beth' (Beales, before 2006). Description 'English Miss' is a compact bushy shrub, 2 to 3 ft (60-91 cm) in height, with a 2 to 3 ft spread (60-91 cm). Blooms are large, 4 inch (10 cm), with 24 or more petals, Flowers are double in form, camellia-like and emit a strong and sweet fragrance with a spicy undertone. They are often borne in large clusters in the traditional floribunda style. 'English Miss' is pale pink in colour, often with darker pink edges. The plant blooms repeatedly, starting from June and progressing through to mid-October. Foliage is purple to dark green and leathery. Flowers do extremely well in rainy weather. 'English Miss' can tolerate exposed conditions and has good disease resistance, especially against the common rose disease black spot.

It is located in the eastern part of the province, 50 kilometers southwest of Holgu√≠n and 20 in the east of Las Tunas.  History  The land in the area was sold for a trifle by Lico L√≥pez to American D. E. Kerr and his neocolonizing retinue. The town of Omaja was settled by American Methodists. In the year 1905, the Americans who had settled there, without wasting any time, began the construction of a town with the architecture of the American west. The streets were named after the men who bought them: Kreider, Frankbert, Blasser, etc. Unlike the majority of other towns in Cuba, Omaja has no Roman Catholic church or establishment, due to it remaining a small, Methodist town since its founding. However, in the past at least, there was a small population of Catholics who would have a monthly mass with a priest from another town. Between 1906 and 1909, just outside town was the Finnish Utopian community of Ponnistus. Founded by Oscar Norring, a merchant seaman, and William Keskinen. The community was mostly Finnish-American loggers, miners, and craftsmen. Norringhad been in the employ of the Buenvista Fruit Company and his vision for the community was as a citrus grove. Lack of water and poor connections to the railroad made the efforts difficult. Between 1909 and 1910, a section of the Central Railroad was finished. When the station was opened, the town was named Majibacoa, but again the American prepotency prevailed and a new board with the name of Omaha appeared overnight - in allusion to a tribe of red skins - the Cubans rejected the interference and after several changes Omaja prevailed. The 1919 census reveals Omaja's population consisted of 2, 381 inhabitants, it had 13 trades, three hotels, a phone center, a silent cinema, two bakeries, two cemeteries (one for the Cubans and another for the Americans), a Ford agency, two saw-mills, and a shop of cabinetmakers. In 1920, the political violence between the conservatives and the liberals, and the bank moratorium put an end to the accomplished attempts of neo- colonization. In 1928, with the construction of the Central Highway, Omaja's decadence began to end. This happened because many of its inhabitants moved to Las Parras, Gast√≥n, and Buenaventura in order to be closer to the highway.

Gallois was co-founder with Denis de Sallo of the Journal des s√ßavans, and directed its publication from 1666 to 1674. Readers of the Journal found Sallo outrageously lacking in respectfulness, while also complaining of review articles by Gallois as no more than bland compilations.Lucien Paul Victor Febvre, Henri-Jean Martin (1997), The Coming of the Book: the impact of printing 1450-1800 (English translation).

Summary The T≈çkaid≈ç Freight Line runs parallel to the immediate west of the Yokosuka and T≈çkaid≈ç passenger lines from Odawara Station to Higashi-Totsuka Station, where it veers west via Yokohama Hazawa freight station and long tunnels bypassing Yokohama. Near Tsurumi Station, the bypass rejoins the main passenger route for a short distance, and has connections to the freight-only to Sakuragich≈ç Station, the Hinkaku Line and Musashino Line. The freight line then curves east, briefly sharing tracks with the Nambu Branch Line between Hatch≈çnawate and Hama-Kawasaki stations, then veers north past Kawasaki freight station, under the entrance to Haneda Airport northward to the Tokyo Freight Terminal. The line north from here, currently dormant, continues to Hamamatsuch≈ç Station alongside a branch of the T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen used to move empty rolling stock to and from a nearby depot.Route description based on the Japanese Wikipedia article, corroborated using Google Maps Beyond Hamamatsuch≈ç Station the T≈çkaid≈ç Freight Line also continued to Shibaura Station (located on a branch line), the Shiodome Freight Terminal (the site of the original Shimbashi Station) and eventually to Tokyo Market Station (located at the Tsukiji fish market). The Tokyo Market Station closed in 1984, followed by Shibaura Station in 1985 and Shiodome Freight Terminal in 1986. The latter dormant section was closed to enable construction of the Toei ≈åedo Line subway near Hamamatsuch≈ç Station. Until 1980, the T≈çkaid≈ç Freight Line included the Hinkaku Line until it was converted for passenger use as part of the Yokosuka Line. Takashima Line The freight- only Takashima Line is a branch of the T≈çkaid≈ç Freight Line between Tsurumi Station and Sakuragich≈ç Station, giving access for freight trains to and from the Negishi Line. It branches off from Tsurumi Station and ends at Sakuragich≈ç Station in Yokohama, with a branch between Tsurumi and Sakuragich≈ç leading off to Shink≈ç Station located at Pier 4 of the Port of Kawasaki. File:Takashimasen.JPGTakashima Line tracks, June 2010 Future developmentsS≈çtetsu connections= The following lines are under construction by Sagami Railway (S≈çtetsu) and the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency: * a 2.7 km new underground line, called the , connecting Nishiya Station on the Sagami Railway Main Line with the T≈çkaid≈ç Freight Line. The line, initially expected to be completed by 2015, now pushed back to 2019, will enable direct passenger services from S≈çtetsu lines to the Saiky≈ç Line which runs across central Tokyo via the Yokosuka Line. The line eventually opened in November 30 2019. =Haneda Airport connection= Since 2000 there have been proposals to use part of the line for passenger access to Haneda Airport, which is located just south of the Tokyo Freight Terminal. JR East announced in 2013, after the award of the 2020 Summer Olympics, that it was considering using the disused part of the freight line as a passenger connection between the Yamanote Line corridor (near Tamachi Station) and Haneda by building a new tunnel between Tokyo Freight Terminal and the airport. In 2014, JR indicated that the line may be connected to the Ueno- Tokyo Line to allow through access to the Tohoku Main Line, and/or to the Rinkai Line for through service to the Saikyo Line and/or Keiyo Line. Although both JR and the Tokyo government have indicated that improved Haneda access is a high priority, JR has indicated that the connection and necessary line upgrades will take around ten years to complete and are unlikely to be completely ready for the 2020 Olympics.

This enabled him to arrange a $3 million USD payout to the trio. The scam was exposed when a 43-to-1 longshot won the Breeders' Cup Classic. This unanticipated victory made Davis the sole winner of the Pick 6 jackpot. Eventually, Harn, Davis and DaSilva entered pleas of guilty. The incident was the largest betting scandal to take place in the United States in a century. It also exposed serious security flaws in the system used to collect bets for horse races. Background Harn was a senior computer programmer at Autotote, which handled the wagers for 65 percent of horse races in North America at the time. In the fall of 2001, Harn discovered unclaimed ticket data that if claimed, would total hundreds of thousands of dollars. Using this data, he reprinted the unclaimed tickets so that he and his friends could claim them at local tracks. However, cashing them was another matter. As an Autotote employee, he was restricted from making wagers himself. In any event, he was too well known at the tracks to cash them. To solve this problem, he talked DaSilva and Davis into cashing the tickets at various tracks. The three men had been friends and fraternity brothers at Tau Kappa Epsilon during their days at Drexel University. DaSilva now lived in New York City while Davis lived in Baltimore. Davis and DaSilva traveled to several tracks in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania to cash the vouchers. The three men then split the winnings. However, Harn soon realized that if they kept it up too long, they'd eventually be tracked down. He looked for a way to get one big payoff that could allow him to easily cover his tracks. He found it in the Breeders' Cup, the richest day in American horse racing. Harn decided to go for the Ultra Pick 6, in hopes of scoring a win by picking the winners of the six major races of the competition‚Äîthe Classic, Turf, Sprint, Distaff, Juvenile and Mile. Finding a weak link At the time, all wagers placed at the numerous off-track betting parlors around the country that were still live after the second race of a Pick 4 and the fourth race of a Pick 6 were forwarded to Autotote headquarters in Newark, Delaware and to the track where the race was held. Harn discovered that there was a half-hour delay between the end of the second or fourth race and when the live wagers were forwarded‚Äîenough time to alter the results. Harn was uniquely positioned to take advantage of this weak link. He was a \\"super user\\"‚Äîthe highest level of access at Autotote. In fact, he was responsible for maintaining the entire network. He had DaSilva set up an account at the Catskill Off-Track Betting Corporation in Pomona, New York. Harn liked Catskill because its security was fairly lax. Unlike other OTB parlors, it didn't require the bettor to be physically present to open an account, and also didn't have a transaction history file. It was also a fairly low-traffic facility, making it easier to alter bets. He'd set up the system himself, so he knew how it could be exploited. The scheme Harn had DaSilva conduct two dry runs of their scheme. On October 3, DaSilva bet on the Pick 4 harness races at Balmoral Park, about 45 miles from Arlington Park. After the first two races, Harn logged in and altered the original bets on the first two races, then picked every horse in the last two races. As a result, DaSilva netted $80,000 in winnings. Two days later, Harn and DaSilva repeated the pattern in a Pick 6 at Belmont Park. This time, DaSilva scored $100,000. For the Breeders' Cup, Harn had Davis open an account at Catskill in case the authorities got suspicious of DaSilva. Davis then called Catskill from his home in Baltimore to buy a $12 Pick 6 ticket, picking one winner in the first four races. On Breeders' Cup Day, Harn slipped into his office at Autotote. To make sure he was covered, he remotely ejected the backup tape at Catskill before the first race. He then took several calls from Davis while the races were underway. After the fourth race, and half an hour before the Turf, Harn hacked onto the system and tracked down Davis' bet. He then changed Davis' original bet to reflect the actual four winners. After having the Catskill techs reinsert the tape, he bet on every horse running in the Turf and Classic, assuring that he would win. The plan worked, and they were able to turn their original $1,152 bet into almost $3.1 million in winnings--$2.57 million for winning the Pick 6, plus $498,000 in consolation prizes for picking five out of six winners. Suspicions mount Unfortunately for Harn and his friends, the Classic was won by Volponi, a 43-to-1 longshot. Had a horse won with shorter odds, or if more money had been bet on Volponi, there would have been more winners‚Äîand a smaller payout‚Äîand Davis' bet would have looked normal. As it turned out, Davis held the only jackpot winner. The nature of the bet raised suspicions as well. While most bettors pick more than one horse to increase their chances of winning, as mentioned above Davis selected only one horse for the first four races and effectively played the same ticket six times. It also seemed unusual that all the bets were placed through Catskill, a fairly small operation. The New York Racing Association asked the New York State Racing and Wagering Board to launch an investigation. As a first step, the board asked Arlington Park and Catskill not to pay out Davis' winnings. The New York State Police, FBI and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York later joined in the investigation. Harn and Davis were very nervous, but finally decided their only course was to claim the bet was legitimate. Davis went to the press, maintaining his innocence. He said the only reason that the payout was so large was that he'd intended to make a $2 bet rather than the $12 bet he'd actually made. Davis demanded proof of any wrongdoing. Caught The fact that the nature of the ticket changed so abruptly after the first four races (the same four winners picked for the first four races on every bet and then every possible combination of horses in the last two races) led investigators to wonder early on if someone had hacked into the system and changed the ticket. Naturally, the focus turned to the Autotote system. Autotote immediately suspected an inside job, and questioned all of its employees in Newark. They soon discovered that Harn wasn't scheduled to work on the day of the race, but had still been in the office. Even more seriously, they discovered Harn had tapped into the system and altered Davis' ticket after the first four races. When Harn couldn't explain his activity or what he was doing at work in the first place, Autotote fired him and turned over the results of its own investigation to New York State and federal officials. Investigators soon discovered that Harn and Davis had been members of Drexel's Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter. Not long after that, they discovered DaSilva had been a member of that fraternity at the same time as Harn and Davis, and also had an account at Catskill. They soon discovered that DaSilva's bets at Balmoral and Belmont were similar in nature to the larger bet Davis made at the Breeders' Cup‚Äîraising suspicions that they were dry runs for the Breeders' Cup bet. The New York State Police also seized computers from Autotote and Harn's house, and also subpoenaed Harn's phone records. On November 12, Harn, Davis and DaSilva were each charged with one count of wire fraud in White Plains, New York. James Comey, the U.S. Attorney for Southern New York, portrayed the scheme as a 21st-century version of The Sting. In the face of mounting evidence‚Äîincluding numerous calls from Davis' cell phone to Harn's Autotote phone and witnesses who saw Harn logged into the Catskill site while on the phone‚Äî Harn opted to cooperate with investigators. He not only admitted rigging the Breeders' Cup bet and the test runs he'd conducted with DaSilva, but also told investigators about his scheme to cash unpaid tickets‚Äîsomething they didn't know anything about. Federal law requires anyone cooperating with prosecutors to disclose all criminal activity in which they'd engaged. On November 20‚Äîa week after the indictment‚ÄîHarn pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and computer fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He admitted to rigging the Breeders' Cup, Balmoral and Belmont bets. He also admitted to bilking legitimate winners out of $92,500 with his duplicate ticket scheme. On December 11, DaSilva pleaded guilty to similar charges, but claimed he didn't know Davis was in on the scheme and that he took no part in the Breeders' Cup bet. The next day, Davis pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and gave up all claims to the money. On March 20, 2003; Harn was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison. Davis received 37 months while DaSilva received two years. The $3.1 million payoff was split among 78 people who'd gotten five out of six races right; each got $39,000 in addition to their original $4,600 consolation prizes. Fallout Even though Autotote officials characterized the scheme as the actions of a \\"rogue software engineer\\", the National Thoroughbred Racing Association took swift action in the face of a growing outcry once the nature of the scam emerged. It required all tote companies to modify their software to transmit betting information immediately after the bet has closed. It also pressured its member tracks into not doing business with parlors that didn't have the ability to record wagers taken over the phone. The scheme was profiled on the Canadian television series Masterminds.

He is \\"rosh yeshiva\\" (head of the yeshiva) of Yeshivat Shuvu Bonim (also known as Yeshivat Nechamat Zion) in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The movement is seen by some as a sect. Berland is a member of Vaad Olami D'Chasedai Breslov (World Committee of Breslov Chassidim), a supervisory council for many Breslov activities. Following allegations of sexual misconduct, Berland fled Israel, traveling from country to country to avoid extradition to Israel. He was eventually returned to Israel, where he confessed to having committed rape, and was sentenced to 18 months' incarceration for his sexual attacks on two women, as well as his instructions to assault the husband of one of the women he had sexually assaulted.  Early life  Berland was born in Haifa in 1937. While a youth, he was recognized as a gifted student. He studied at the Knesses Chizkiyahu yeshiva in Kfar Hasidim under Rabbi Elyah Lopian and Rabbi Dov Yaffe. After his marriage to his wife, Tehilla, who is the daughter of Knesset member Shalom-Avraham Shaki, Berland joined the Ponevezh Yeshiva kollel and, later, the Volozhin Kollel in Bnei Brak. He was a chavruta (study partner) with Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, known as the Steipler Gaon.  Noted students  Among his students is Rabbi Shalom Arush, rosh yeshiva of Chut Shel Chessed Yeshiva of Jerusalem and a popular speaker and author on Breslov topics.  Controversies  Several women have reported that Berland sexually harassed or raped them. The allegations came to light in 2012 when the newspaper Israel Hayom reported an incident in which one of Berland's students allegedly encountered him at home standing beside a naked woman. His supporters expressed anger over the report, and the person who leaked the story to the media was later violently attacked.Rabbi accused of sex-abuse ordered out of Morocco - Israel Hayom. According to Berland's followers, the accusations were made by relatives of Berland's enemies. After the police opened an investigation, Berland immediately fled Israel, and spent time in the United States, Italy, and Switzerland. He then left for Morocco, settling in Marrakesh. Berland lived in Marrakesh for seven months and was welcomed by the small Moroccan Jewish community. He intended to establish a kehilla in Marrakesh, based on the Shuvu Banim yeshiva, and planned on building a community center, educational institutions, and apartments for his followers. Thousands of his followers began travelling to Marrakesh to celebrate holidays and commemorate events with him, and some took up residency. In November 2013, Berland and his students were ordered to leave Morocco by King Mohammed VI. According to news reports, a Moroccan newspaper had published an article profiling the rabbi and mentioning the circumstances in which he fled Israel, and the king ordered Berland's expulsion after reading the article. Berland's followers claimed that the king was merely concerned for their safety, as they were Hasidic Jews living in a Muslim country.Morocco expels fugitive Israeli rabbi - Haaretz Berland is thought to have left Morocco for Cairo, Egypt. He reportedly bought tickets for various destinations to confuse pursuers and in the end chose Zimbabwe. From there, he allegedly took a flight to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he was taken in by a relative. On April 14, 2014, the Chief Rabbi of South Africa, Warren Goldstein, called on the South African Jewish community not to shelter or support Berland. Berland then flew to Zimbabwe, reportedly in a private jet owned by a wealthy follower. He lived in an upscale hotel room in Bulawayo and led worship services for members of the small Zimbabwean Jewish community in a synagogue in the Bulawayo suburb of Khumalo. He was joined by some of his followers. He hired two attorneys in Israel due to the possibility of being forced to return to Israel if his options ran out. On April 7, 2014, police raided Berland's hotel room and found him with some followers from Israel. After it was established that his visitor's visa had expired, he was arrested and charged with remaining in Zimbabwe without a permit. He pleaded guilty before a magistrate judge, and was remanded to custody. He was also reportedly questioned over the sexual assault allegations. A magistrate judge gave him a choice between paying a $200 fine or three months in prison, and ordered him expelled. Berland paid the fine, and left for South Africa, returning to Johannesburg. There, he lived in hiding, and managed, with help from followers, to narrowly escape two attempts by police to detain him.Bye Rabbi: ‚ÄòSex pest‚Äô Israeli cleric deported The South African Jewish Report featured the first interview of a student trying to defend the accusations against Berland. He claimed a large conspiracy against the rabbi and religious persecution by a sectarian Israeli government. In September 2014, Berland left South Africa on a flight to the Netherlands and was arrested after arriving at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol on September 11. Shortly after his detention, Berland was released. A Dutch court ruled against his extradition after it was shown that there was no active arrest warrant for him in Israel. The Israeli police confirmed that he was only wanted for questioning, and there was no warrant. The judge ruled that the Israeli police would have to obtain an arrest warrant from an Israeli court before starting extradition proceedings. In an interview with Israeli media shortly after his release, Berland claimed that the police had told him that the claims were nonsense, and a follower claimed that the Israeli media outlets which originally reported the allegations were now treating them as untrue in their more recent broadcasts. Israel and the Netherlands engaged in extradition talks over Berland, while in the meantime he had been granted freedom of movement rights throughout the European Union while his case was pending.http://www.sajr.co.za/opinion/surveys-most-commented- stories/2014/09/14/r-berland-a-free-man-in-amsterdam After the court ruling, 300 supporters came to see him, and Berland hosted a reception for them on a Jewish-owned camping site on the island of Texel. The authorities evicted most of them, as the number of supporters rose over the site's capacity. On December 1, 2014, Berland's extradition was further delayed by a Dutch court due to new evidence submitted by his defense. On February 12, 2015, his extradition to Israel was ordered by a Dutch court. The decision to extradite him was in the hands of the Dutch Secretary for Justice, Klaas Dijkhoff. Berland's followers tried to install themselves in a camp in Susteren, but it was full. 250 people lodged in a vacant youth hostel in Oldebroek until the mayor ordered them to leave on May 3, 2015, because of inhumane conditions and fire hazards. The ruling was appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court, which on June 30, 2015, said that Berland could be extradited to Israel. On the night of October 18, 2015, Berland's followers entered Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, as requested by the Berland from abroad. Their entry without security clearance required their rescue by the Israeli army, and was followed by arson of the Tomb by Palestinians. On April 7, 2016, Berland was again arrested in South Africa. Preceding and following his arrest were mass prayer vigils and demonstrations. On March 22, 2016, facing arrest, Berland asked his followers to hold an all-night prayer vigil at the cave of the patriarchs in Hebron. Approximately 8,000 people attended the six-hour-long rally. Following his arrest, on April 25, hundreds of followers demonstrated outside the South African embassy in Ramat Gan against the \\"unlawful arrest of the Rabbi\\" and his being denied humanitarian rights in prison. On April 27, thousands of supporters once again held a mass prayer vigil at the cave of the patriarchs in Hebron. On May 1, 2016, Rabbi Yitzchak Dovid Grossman visited Berland to \\"aid him and ease his conditions\\". While there, he spoke about Berland's prison conditions, saying he was being denied food and had not eaten in days. He spoke about this to the media to raise awareness; other rabbis, like Shalom Arush, followed suit and spoke to the media about Berland's condition. On May 21, 2016, Grossman flew a second time to visit Berland, and apparently succeeded in making some kind of deal between Berland and the Israeli authorities in which Berland would turn himself in voluntarily. On May 27, 2016, Berland released a letter and audio recording to his followers saying, \\"I decided to return to Israel\\".  Conviction and sentencing  On November 18, 2016, Berland was convicted by the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court after admitting to two counts of indecent acts and one assault. He was sentenced on November 22 to 18 months imprisonment. Berland has expressed remorse over his acts and said that he takes responsibility for what happened: \\"I am willing to accept any punishment in the world, including burning me and stoning me because that is Torah law. The punishment that was meted to me was perhaps too light, and I am willing to accept a greater punishment\\".Mordechai Sones: Eliezer Berland apologizes: 'I'm willing to be burned alive' May 4, 2017 . On February 12, 2017, Berland was taken to the hospital for an urgent operation. He was later released to house arrest because of his health.Rabbi Berland hospitalized Arutz Sheva Staff, February 12, 2017.  Formation and ruling of special Beis Din  At the request of many, a special Beis Din was convened to investigate the rumors that have come out against Berland, the leader of the Shuvu Bonim community. The Beis Din comprised three dayanim, one from each of the leading Batei Dinim in the land of Israel, and its goal was to adjudicate the manner in which everyone should conduct themselves. On June 24, 2019, this special Beis din, issued the following order regarding Berland: \\"To stop immediately all hatred, persecution, arguments and slander, in writing and in speech, and in all form of media and publication.\\" The statement was signed by Moishe Sternbuch, Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss, and others. On May 20, after months of collecting evidence and testimony, the special Beis din issued their final conclusive ruling. The Beis Din described the content of the testimonies that they had heard as ‚Äúuntoward acts‚Äù and ‚Äúvery serious behaviors,‚Äù and they concluded that, ‚ÄúIt is clear that according to the opinion of our holy teachings, anyone who violates the three cardinal sins and their derivatives, someone who values his soul must stay away from him [the violator] and one is obligated to act in this way.‚Äù The ruling also contained a paragraph warning that this is a serious issue since defenders of Berland have excused his behavior, even publishing books, claiming it is permitted for a Tzaddik to perform a sins. The ruling continued, \\"These matters are to considered complete heresy in the fundamentals of our religion. We must uproot and remove this heresy from within us.\\"  References  External links  * Shuvu Bonim Yeshiva website * Shuvu Banim International website Category:Breslov rabbis Category:20th-century rabbis Category:21st-century rabbis Category:Hasidic rosh yeshivas Category:Israeli Hasidic rabbis Category:Ponevezh Yeshiva alumni Category:People from Haifa Category:Living people Category:Orthodox Jewish outreach Category:1937 births Category:People extradited to Israel Category:Rabbis convicted of crimes Category:Israeli sex offenders Category:Jewish cults ","title":"Eliezer Berland"},{"id":"22866967","text":"Blind Bay may refer to the following places: *Blind Bay (Antarctica) *Blind Bay, British Columbia *Blind Bay, New Zealand, the original name given to what is now known as Tasman Bay *Blind Bay, Nova Scotia *Blind Bay (Washington) ","title":"Blind Bay"},{"id":"22866968","text":"Little Lake is a former settlement in Inyo County that lies just off U.S. Route 395 on Little Lake Road.  History  Little Lake was established largely as a traveler's stop along what eventually became US 395, after the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power dammed the site's eponymous landmark ‚Äì once known as Owens Little Lake ‚Äì as part of its work on the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1905. While early on the town had a store, auto repair shop and gas station, its most famous landmark was its namesake, rock-faced hotel constructed in 1923. Little Lake was a necessary stop for travelers journeying up to the Eastern Sierra from Los Angeles for decades. In the 1920s, a trip from Los Angeles to a town such as Lone Pine might take 2 or 3 days necessitating a stay at locations like Little Lake before continuing onwards. In the 1940s, ‚Äúsportsman traffic heading northward along US 395 considered Little Lake an important stop to spray cooling water on boiling radiators, feed hungry stomachs or to get gasoline.‚Äù The Little Lake Hotel in the 1950s = Decline = As technology improved, travelers no longer needed to stop as often for rest and supplies. By the 1960s travelers could easily go from Los Angeles to locations in the Eastern Sierra with little more than brief stops for gas. With these improvements small settlements like Bramlette, named after the founder and later renamed Little Lake, became increasingly obsolete. In the early 1960s, US 395 was realigned. As a result, the former alignment that Little Lake was built on became a frontage road known as Little Lake Road, and the need to access it by leaving US 395 eventually spelled the demise of local businesses. In 1981, with Little Lake's population at 52 residents, Southern Pacific's \\"Slim Princess\\" Narrow Gauge Railroad that passed Little Lake had already long been abandoned and the rails were permanently removed. The Little Lake Hotel, which had evolved into an apartment building for local residents, burned in 1989 and was never rebuilt. In 1997, the United States Postal Service ended service at Little Lake, and by the early 2000s Little Lake Road, building foundations, off ramps and even its road signs were bulldozed into oblivion and hauled away. = Current State = Little Lake, Inyo County, California Though it remains properly marked as a geographic location on a few maps, the entire townsite had been restored to its natural state by the summer of 2001.

Early life  Michel de la Rivi√®re studied theology at the University of Bourges,Michel and his father were not the only members of their family to be in Bourges.

His uncle rewarded him with the appointments as the dean of Navacelles near Uz√®s and the Vicar General of Uz√®s in the C√©vennes, where young Michel had to deal with the revolt of the Camisards, for which he drew up a proposal for their expulsion. In 1689, he also became the abb√© commendataire [ honorary abbot ] of the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Pierre in Vierzon and managed to add the post of canon, through r√©gale, in Sarlat.

On 7 June 1706, Michel de la Rivi√®re was appointed as the 79th Bishop of Angers. Two months later, on 1 August, he was consecrated in Paris at the √âglise des Grandes-J√©suits [ Great Church of the Jesuits ] by the Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal de Noailles. Candel, Les pr√©dicateurs fran√ßais, page 354.  The Bishop of Angers  As the Bishop of Angers, La Rivi√®re was firm and orthodox. He assigned his Vicar General, , to write the essay, Conferences d‚ÄôAngers, published in 1716; promoted the Papal bull, Unigenitus, against Jansenism; condemned Les Hexples, ou les six colomnes sur la Constitution Unigenitus, the 1721 collection of six Jansenist essays; denied the appeal from the Benedictines of the five Angevin abbeys; defeated two bishops in a debate at the Assembly of the Clergy in 1725. Jean, Les √©v√™ques et les arch√©v√™ques de France, page 427. But he also found the time to dedicate in 1710 l'√âglise du Bon-Pasteur [ Church of the Good Shepherd ], built on rue Saint-Nicolas [ St. Nicholas Street ] in Angers, for the Soeurs du Bon Pasteur [ not to be confused with the modern Good Shepherd Sisters ], a local community of non-cloistered nuns; and to build, at his own expense, the Chapel of the Calvary, set against the Cathedral, as the shrine of the mission cross. Bodin, Recherches historiques sur l' Anjou, page 436 He was also on a shortlist of three clergymen for the post of the preceptor of King Louis XV in 1714 but he did not get the post. In his youth, before he became famous as an orator, Michel devoted himself to poetry with some success.Very few of his compositions have survived from his youth but d'Alembert cited in his elegy one of them as an elegant example of a sestina, written in response to a bouquet of flowers sent by a relative who remembered his name day because of a beggar asking for alms in the name of St. Michael, celebrated on that day (29 September): Translated from the French: As an orator, he was considered to be one of the best, along with Jean Baptiste Massillon and Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet. He earned great praise for two speeches he made at the Court ‚Äì one of them in 1715 during Lent and the other in 1722 for the coronation of King Louis XV ‚Äì but Saint-Simon felt that La Rivi√®re's skills as an orator were not the equal of these important occasions. Saint-Simon, M√©moires, Ch√©ruel and Regnier, editors, Volume 8, page 448: In 1711, after hearing La Rivi√®re at the funeral of the Monseigneur, Saint-Simon felt that the Bishop had made \\"une tr√®s-m√©chante oraison fun√®bre [ a very nasty funeral sermon ].\\" A year later, in 1723, his fortunes came to a sudden end. Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, the Regent of France, had just died. His death caused the clergy considerable distress because, in spite his notoriously dissolute lifestyle,Although the funeral sermon had great quality, the Duke of Orleans was an atheist who favored Jansenism and opposed the authority of the Pope. his funeral oration would have to be delivered to the pleasure and satisfaction of the King and his Court.It seems that, upon hearing the news of the Duke‚Äôs death, La Rivi√®re, before he was chosen to give the funeral sermon, said : \\"Je plains celui qui sera charg√© de son oraison fun√®bre [ I have compassion for the person who will be in charge of his funeral oration ].\\" See Bodin, Recherches historiques sur l' Anjou, page 437. La Rivi√®re was chosen for this job. But, during the funeral, when he came to the matter of the salvation of the Duke‚Äôs soul, the Bishop blurted, \\"Je crains; mais j'espere [ I fear but I hope ]\\". d'Alembert, \\"Eloge de Poncet de la Rivi√®re\\", page 110. Saint-Simon, \\"M√©moires\\", Ch√©ruel and Regnier, editors, Volume 19, page 213: Saint-Simon did not mention \\"Je crains; mais j'espere\\" in his M√©moires; he was more concerned with the quality of the sermon itself. He complained that it did \\"ne r√©pondit pas √† la grandeur du sujet [ not respond to the grandeur of the subject ]\\".At that time the Bishop was not allowed to have doubts. It was still widely believed that the royalty and nobility had a right to salvation regardless of the weight of their sins. Saint-Simon reported that the wife of the Marshal de la Meilleraye, learning of the death of a nobleman of the court from dissipation, felt that some feared for his salvation, and then added, \\"Je vous assure qu'√† des gens de cette qualit√©-l√†, Dieu regarde bien √† deux fois pour les damner [ For my part, I am persuaded that God will think twice about damning a man of such high birth as that! ].\\" The English translation of her original quotation is on page 135 of Baylis St. John's version, The Memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon on the Reign of Louis XIV. and the Regency., Sixth Edition., Volume II. (London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., Ltd., 1900). These words were enough to banish him from the Court. However, his oration remains as one of the best funeral sermons ever written in the French language. In fact, d'Alembert declared, \\"Quand l'√©v√™que d'Angers n'e√ªt √©crit que ce peu de mots en toute sa vie, il ne devrait pas √™tre plac√© dans la classe des orateurs ordinaires [ If the Bishop of Angers had not written these few words, he would be counted only among the ordinary orators ].\\" It is notable for the following passage: > \\"Du pied du plus beau tr√¥ne du monde il tombe ... dans l'√©ternit√©. Mais > pourquoi, mon Dieu, apr√®s en avoir fait un prodige de talents, n'en feriez- > vous pas un prodige de mis√©ricorde?\\" > \\"From the foot of the most beautiful throne of the world he falls ... in > eternity. But why, my God, after having made a miracle of talent, have You > not done a miracle of mercy?\\"  Last years  In his retirement, La Rivi√®re was rewarded with the esteem of the men of letters when he was elected as a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1728. He was received at the Academy on 10 January 1729 but he was not able to enjoy such an honor for a long time. On 2 August 1730, he died at the Ch√¢teau d‚Äô√âventard, Hoefer, Nouvelle biographie g√©n√©rale, column 739:fr:√âventard, southeast of √âcouflant, was the traditional residence of the Bishops of Angers. Built in 1280 by Nicolas Gellant, the 53rd Bishop of Angers, it was \\"par chacun d'eux embelli, mais surtout augment√© [ embellished by each, but especially increased ]\\" by the successive Bishops of Angers, including La Rivi√®re, until the French Revolution, when the civilian buyers razed the whole estate to the ground.

Hayworth } Electors Technically the voters of Arizona cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Arizona is allocated eight electors because it has 6 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write- in votes must submit a list of 8 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 8 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 18, 2000http://www.uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/ARTICLES/pe2000timeline.php to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All were pledged to and voted for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney: #Joe Arpaio #Linda Barber #Dennis Booth #Webb Crockett #Paul Robert Fannin #LaVelle McCoy #Susan Minnaugh #Frank Straka References Category:2000 Arizona elections Arizona 2000 ","title":"2000 United States presidential election in Arizona"},{"id":"22866989","text":"Lookout City is a former settlement in the Mojave Desert, in Inyo County, California. It lay at an elevation of 3579 feet (1091 m). History In 1875 rich deposits of silver-lead ore were discovered in the Argus Range on top of Lookout mountain. The discovery was named the Modoc, and was sold to a group of investors which included George Hearst, the famed mining engineer, U.S. Senator, and father of William Randolph Hearst. (He was also the great-great grandfather of Patty Hearst.) The Modoc Consolidated Mining Company was formed with the Modoc mine as the principal mine. Together with the discovery of other nearby mines, which included the Minnietta Belle below Lookout Mountain, these mines formed the basis for the Modoc District with the townsite of Lookout located on top of Lookout Mountain. The town of Lookout consisted of 2 general stores, 3 saloons, company offices, and as many as 30 other wood and stone structures. By 1876 two 60 ton furnaces and a 10-stamp mill were running and production was quoted as running 160 silver-lead bars per day. The bars averaged 90 lbs. each and assayed around $400.00. By the end of 1876 Remi Nadeau's Cerro Gordo Freighting Company had hauled 10,000 bars worth some $4,000,000 over the Bullion Trail which was originally built for the ore of the Cerro Gordo Mines. Remi Nadeau needed a faster route for his teams, so he constructed the Nadeau \\"Shotgun\\" road across the Panamint Valley and over the Slate Range to meet the Bullion Trail south of China Lake. To supply the furnaces with charcoal, 10 charcoal kilns were built in Wildrose Canyon 25 miles away in the Panamint Range, and a steady stream of burros delivered charcoal in sacks to Lookout City via a pack trail on the east side of Lookout Mountain. The U.S. Bureau of Mines reported that total production during the period 1875 through 1890 amounted to $1,900,000 from the Modoc Mine alone.

Several times a candidate for the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, he was elected a member in 1865 and was the permanent secretary from 1876. As Manager of Theater Administration, in 1867 Camille Doucet authorized the caf√©-concerts \\"to use costumes, cross-dressing; to perform plays, to have interludes of dance and acrobatics\\"; these measures would support the further development of large venues, such as the Folies Berg√®re or the Olympia. Although Flaubert complained of him, he had a reputation for honesty and kindness; the memoirs of Sarah Bernhardt show that he supported her debuts at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and gave her entry to the Od√©on. Camille Doucet was the author of several poems and numerous plays: vaudevilles, operas, comedies in verse. While some of them were met in their time with success, they are now largely forgotten.

Charles-Albert-Marie Costa, Marquis de Beauregard (24 May 1835 - 15 February 1909) was a French historian and politician. He also fought in the Franco- Prussian War. His works include a trilogy on Charles Albert of Sardinia. Early life Costa de Beauregard was born at La Motte-Servolex on 24 May 1835. He was the eldest son of Louis Marie Pantaleon Costa, Marquis de Beauregard (1806‚Äì1864) and the former Marthe Augustine de Saint-Georges de V√©rac, who married in 1834. His brother was Gabriel-Marie-Paul, Count Costa de Beauregard (who married their cousin Marie-Pauline Herminie de Roug√©). His paternal grandparents were Victor Costa de Beauregard and Elisabeth de Quinson.

He participated in the Franco-Prussian War (which took place between July 1870 to January 1871) as commander of the 1st bataillon des mobiles de la Savoie, and he was wounded and taken prisoner during the Battle of the Lisaine in January 1871. From 1871 to 1876, he was a member of Parliament for Savoy. =Historian and writer= After the war, he retired from politics to devote himself to his writing on the subject of his family history, Savoy and the monarchy. Beauregard's most important works are a trilogy on King Charles Albert of Savoy, and Historical Memoirs of the Royal House of Savoy, based on documents held in his family archive and which was a completion of the work begun by his grandfather in 1816. He was a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Savoie, and its president from 1887 to 1889.

Moisture meters are used to measure the percentage of water in a given substance. This information can be used to determine if the material is ready for use, unexpectedly wet or dry, or otherwise in need of further inspection. Wood and paper products are very sensitive to their moisture content. Physical properties are strongly affected by moisture content and high moisture content for a period of time may progressively degrade a material. Meters for wood Newly-cut logs can have a moisture content (MC) of 80% or more, depending on species. Since wood shrinks, and can also split, twist or otherwise change shape as it dries, most wood is dried before being used. This is most often done using a kiln, but may use the air drying method, which is much slower. In most parts of the United States, the minimum moisture content that can be generally obtained in air drying is about 12 to 15 percent. Most air-dried material is usually closer to 20 percent moisture content when used.http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrn/fplrn226.pdf In-kiln drying is usually monitored by some type of moisture meter. Moisture meters are used to measure the amount of water in the wood so that the woodworker can determine if it is suitable for the intended purpose. Building inspectors and many more, carpenters, hobbyists, and other woodworkers often are required to have moisture meters. Wood flooring installers, for example, have to verify that the MC of the wood matches the relative humidity in the air of the building. If this step is skipped, a vast array of problems may present itself: cracking, cupping, crowning, buckling, sunken joints, and cracked finishes. The problems caused by varying degrees of moisture content in wood go beyond simple shrinkage in the dimensions of wood parts. Problems with distortions in the shape of the wood, such as twisting, warping and cupping, occur because of the difference in the degree of dimensional change in wood cells tangentially (perpendicular to the grain and parallel to the growth rings) versus radially (perpendicular to the growth rings). A moisture meter gives a reading of the approximate moisture content of wood. The reading helps in determining whether the wood is suitably dry for its intended purpose. The moisture content reading can also assist in planning a project design that will accommodate future changes in dimension caused by changes in relative humidity. The amount of overall shrinkage lumber will undergo in the drying process varies from wood species to wood species. The difference between radial and tangential shrinkage also varies from species to species. Woods with a low ratio of tangential to radial shrinkage, such as teak and mahogany, are less prone to distortion due to changes in moisture content than woods with a high ratio, such as eastern white pine and certain species of oak. Species with both low overall shrinkage and a low tangential/radial shrinkage ratio are more stable and will react better to changes in moisture content. For wood that is to be used in making furniture, for wood floors, in construction or for any building project, the ideal state is one of equilibrium moisture content (EMC). EMC means that the wood is in balance with the relative humidity it surrounding environment, and is therefore neither gaining or losing in moisture content. In reality, however, it is extremely rare for an environment to maintain a constant fixed relative humidity, and some degree of dimensional change along with seasonal changes in relative humidity is to be expected. For typical woodworking operations, two basic types of moisture meters are available. Depending in the brand, pin-type meters measure the electrical resistance, termed resistivity, or its reciprocal, conductance, of the wood substrate.https://www.emlab.com/m/store/Protimeter%20New%20Surveymaster%20User%20Manual.pdf Water freely conducts electricity; consequently, increasing water content correlates to increased conductance. Pin-type meters incorporate two pin electrodes which are driven into the wood fibers and directly measure electrical resistance or conductivity. Each brand of moisture meter utilizes proprietary calculations and displays the final moisture content as a percentage. The second type of moisture meter relies on the dielectric properties of wood. The meter incorporates two pads which serve as rubber electrodes that transmit and receive a signal when pressed into the wood substrate. The pad type moisture meter is non-invasive in nature and requires only surface contact with the wood to obtain a reading.Hoadley, R. Bruce: Understanding Wood, Taunton Press, 1989. The non-invasive meter creates a low- frequency electrical wave between the two pads and measures the electrical properties of the wood, similar to the invasive pin-type meter.http://www.inspectortools.com/v/vspfiles/downloadables/Tramex_Moisture_Encounter_Plus_UM.pdf Moisture meters may also be utilized by building-industry professionals and water damage restoration consultants to ascertain precise moisture content of a wide range of materials found in the built environment, such as gypsum board drywall or interior finish plaster. Locating high moisture within buildings is essential in locating leaks that may not be visible to the eye.https://sites.google.com/view/561build/home/moisture-mapping?authuser=0 Moisture content is measured in the same manner as wood and displayed in Wood Moisture Equivalent, or WME. WME is the theoretical moisture content that the substrate would contain if it were wood. This ability to locate and measure moisture anomalies can help manage and control indoor air quality as in relates to mold growth.

This specific choice was made because all four member universities offered degrees in this field. It also included the ICHEC Brussels Management School, a college based in Brussels. After almost three years of active collaboration within the network, the rectors of the four catholic universities decided on March 12, 2007 to open negotiations with the aim of merging the four establishments into one single university. Each site was to become a site of \\"UC Louvain\\". The merger among the four was aborted December 17, 2010 after the ultimate vote on the board of UNamur failed to attain the required 80% (30 in favour and 14 against). FUCaM merges with the Universit√© catholique de Louvain separately on September 15, 2011 becoming the UCL Mons. In 2013, the merger process being cancelled, the FUNDP in Namur and FUSL in Brussels decide to change their names and respectively become the University of Namur and Saint-Louis University, Brussels. In 2017, Saint-Louis University, Brussels and the Universit√© catholique de Louvain (UCL, which has two campuses in Brussels) decide to merge and form a new university called UCLouvain. This last merger is yet to be formally endorsed by the French Community of Belgium that organizes all state funded education, but will de facto take effect in September 2018.  Dissolution  The Acad√©mie Louvain was formally dissolved on February 26, 2016 as a consequence of the new legislation for the higher education in French-speaking Belgium, the D√©cret Paysage (also known as the D√©cret Marcourt).

Most were transported there from further up the canyon, where earlier mine-worker housing was vulnerable to heavy snow, avalanches, earthquakes, and mud slides. The name came from \\"Ro\\" for Round Valley and \\"vana\\" for US Vanadium. The streets were named from states of the Union matching the letters in \\"Vanadium\\" (such as Nevada, Utah, and Montana). Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 ¬∞F. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Rovana has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Rovana, California References Category:Unincorporated communities in Inyo County, California Category:Owens Valley Category:Unincorporated communities in California ","title":"Rovana, California"},{"id":"22867577","text":"Scheelite was an unincorporated community in Inyo County, California.

It is also a part of The Basement Collection. Gameplay The player navigates through five chapters and a bonus chapter as Spewer, a small creature that navigates through single-screen levels by utilizing its own vomit as a platform. Spewer can also walk, jump, and swim. The amount of vomit available to the player is represented by a meter, which can be replaced by Spewer eating food or its own vomit. There are four types of vomit in addition to normal vomit which are accessed by eating pills: white vomit that floats, allowing the player to swim in mid air, red vomit that pushes the player off objects at a faster speed with more power, black vomit hardens to become platforms, and yellow vomit that melts and burns objects. A level editor is included, allowing players to create their own custom levels. Development Spewer was developed by Edmund McMillen and Eli Piilonen and released on Newgrounds on May 4, 2009. A group of four people developed Spewer: Edmund McMillen created the art assets for the game, and Eli Piilonen was the programmer. These two also handled game design elements together.

From source to mouth, the Nogoa River is joined by 29 minor tributaries. North of the river forms confluence with the Comet River to form the Mackenzie River. The Nogoa descends over its course. The river is crossed by the Gregory and Capricorn Highways at Emerald. The river has a catchment area of draining parts of the Minerva Hills, Peak Range, Snake Range national parks. Of this area, is riverine wetlands. The reservoir created by Queensland's second largest dam, Lake Maraboon was formed when the Fairbairn Dam was built on the river in 1972.

Played mainly in New England, hotshot may be played by one or more players. Hotshot is unique in that it is easy to provide handicaps for less experienced players, allowing them to compete with better shooters. Hotshot is also unique in that it may be manipulated to fit any time frame, from five minutes to over an hour.  Rules of Play  First, players choose a spot on the court from which to \\"shoot for the ball\\". Players each take a shot and the first to hit a shot successfully wins first possession of the ball. Once a player has won the ball, he chooses a number of spots, called \\"hotspots\\", on the court, from which to shoot. The number of hotspots to be chosen is determined before the game. No hotspot may be inside the key. Once the player has chosen his hotspots, he proceeds to his first and takes five shots, keeping track of how many he has missed. On the fifth shot, or \\"hotshot\\", the player must prepare to make his own rebound as quickly as possible, because he will have to make a number of shots from wherever he recovers the ball. If he recovers the ball outside the three-point line, he may take his shots from wherever the ball passed over the three-point line; if the player made his \\"hotshot\\", he may take his shots from wherever the ball left the key, if it is outside the key when recovered. If the player hits all five of his hotspot shots, he receives a twenty-point bonus and need not recover his rebound, but may move on to his next hotspot. If the player did not go five for five, the spot where the player recovers his rebound is known as the \\"offspot.\\" In order to proceed to his next hotspot, the player must make as many shots as he missed in the previous round in a row from his offspot. For example, if the player missed three shots from his hotspot, he must make three in a row from his offspot to proceed. If the player misses five shots from his offspot before making the necessary shots in a row, he receives a zero and may proceed to his next hotspot. Once a player has shot from each of his hotspots, he adds up his score, then gives the ball to the next player.  Scoring  When shooting from a hotspot, scoring is simple: a player receives five points for a hit shot, and zero points for a miss. When shooting from an offspot, a player must make the necessary number of shots in a row to score any points. If the player does succeed in making his necessary shots, he receives ten points minus twice the number of shots he missed from his offspot. For example, if the player missed two shots before completing his offspot round, he would receive 10 - 2*2 points, or 10 - 4 = 6 points for the offspot round.  Tournament play  Hotshot can also be a tournament. In tournaments the game is different from normal in a few ways. First players have only a minute to complete their turn, and must get their own rebounds on every shot and hotspots are worth different numbers of points depending on their distance from the basket. Also, offspot rounds are generally not part of tournaments. Players may get a bonus if they finish their round in less than a minute.  Alternate versions  Penalties - In some versions, a player receives a penalty for missing all five of his hotspot shots. The penalty varies from ten to twenty, and in some versions, the player does not get an offspot round but must move directly to his next hotspot. \\"Sprees\\" - In some versions, a player may choose to yell the word \\"spree\\" after making five out of five shots from his hotspot. Upon calling \\"spree\\", the player forfeits his twenty-point bonus, but may continue taking shots from his hotspot until he misses or reaches fifteen shots total (including the original five shots). Every shot is worth five points as if the hotspot round was still going, and thus a player may receive a maximum of 75 points total at one hotspot. If a player calls spree, he need not take an offspot round. Handicaps - In some versions, players must all shoot from the same hotspots. In others, players may choose their own, with experienced players choosing more challenging shots than the novices. This allows for novices to compete with more advanced players, evening out the playing field. Switching turns - Sometimes, players shoot from all their hotspots before giving the ball to the next player. Sometimes, players may alternate after every hotspot. This is a personal choice and may be made before the game.

Since 2008, he was included on the list most wanted fugitives in Italy, until his arrest on January 14, 2009, in Mignano Monte Lungo. Camorra, arrestato il boss Setola. Ai carabinieri: \\"Avete vinto voi\\", Corriere della Sera, January 14, 2009Mafia boss Giuseppe Setola who escaped through sewer is caught, Times Online, January 14, 2009 Setola allegedly headed a squad of killers, and was said to have ordered or carried out 18 murders throughout the latter half of 2008. Police began a massive manhunt against Setola in response to the murders of six West African immigrants in Castel Volturno. On January 12, 2009, Setola evaded arrest by escaping into the sewers through a secret trapdoor during a police raid on his hideout. He was arrested two days later after leading police on a rooftop chase. Setola is currently serving a life imprisonment sentence for murder. He was featured in Gomorrah, the best-selling Roberto Saviano book about the Camorra in Campania. Criminal career Giuseppe Setola was a Camorrista and boss of the Casalesi clan from Caserta. He became considered one of the most wanted fugitives in Italy. He was featured in Gomorrah, the 2006 best-selling book by author Roberto Saviano about the Campanian mafia. Following the book's release, authorities said the Camorra asked Setola to kill Saviano. Although the alleged hit request never took place, Setola was said to have purchased a detonator and explosives for the job. Authorities claimed Setola ordered or carried out 18 murders between May and December 2008, during which time he allegedly led a Casalesi squad of killers, who reportedly sought to eliminate rivals and punish businessmen who refused to pay protection money to the Camorra. The squad was formed during a time of apparent power struggles within the Camorra crime syndicate. Setola was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, but was placed on house arrest in the spring of 2008 when he received a doctor's certificate that he was suffering from an eye infection. Setola escaped and went underground almost immediately after being placed on house arrest. Prosecutors later opened a probe into how Setola organized the escape. In May 2008, Setola and fellow Casalesi member Gianluca Bidognetti allegedly disguised themselves as anti-Mafia police and planned to kill relatives of a clan woman who had been cooperating with police. Setola and Bidognetti, along with others in disguise, allegedly convinced the informant's sister and niece to come onto the streets, but only succeeded in wounding one of them. Bidognetti was arrested in November 2008 for attempted murder in connection to the incident. Setola was also said to be responsible for the murder of a gambling arcade owner in a coastal town neighboring Caserta. Setola has been said to have driven a motorbike during some of his alleged hits. Manhunt Setola was accused of masterminding the September 18 drive- by shootings of six West African immigrants in Castel Volturno, which sparked riots and prompted the deployment of 500 soldiers. More than 100 shots were fired during the killings, which were considered among the largest and bloodiest massacres in recent years. Investigators claimed Setola orchestrated the killings to punish the Africans for getting involved in drug trafficking and impeding on the Casalesi clan's business. In response to the killings, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said the Casalesi clan has \\"declared war on the Italian state\\". Police began a manhunt for Setola and the rest of his gang. In October 2008, Oreste Spagnuolo, a member of Setola's alleged killing squad, started assisting police in their mission to arrest Setola and his other accomplices. The next month, police arrested a Carabinieri paramilitary police officer for providing information to Setola about police operations. Franco Roberti, a Naples anti-Mafia police officer, said in November 2008, \\"Setola is without doubt the brains behind the Casalesi campaign. We are working to flush him out. The circle is closing around him.\\" In January 2009, Setola later sent a letter to a local newspaper denying responsibility for his alleged crimes. He also wrote that he was blind in one eye, a claim that has been met with skepticism by the press, and disputed by police. Setola was eventually found to be sharing a house in Trentola-Ducenta with his wife, Stefania Martinelli, and another suspected mobster. On January 12, 2009, about 50 Carabinieri officers surrounded Setola's hideout in Trentola-Ducenta. As they raided the hideout, Setola and his bodyguard escaped by slipping through a trap door and crawling a mile through a labyrinthine sewer system. The floor and door were secured through a sophisticated locking system, and police said the sewer layout had been \\"studied very well\\". Setola reemerged from a manhole outside a dairy, where he robbed a woman of her car and drove away. Police officers and divers eventually chased Setola through the sewers, but did not find him. Martinelli was placed under arrest and questioned by police after weapons were found in the house. Later that night, the prosecutors leading the hunt for Setola received a threatening letter that included five rounds of live ammunition. Arrest Setola was arrested on January 14, 2009 in Mignano Monte Lungo, where he was seeking treatment for a wrist injury he suffered during his escape two days earlier. Police were tipped off to his location. Setola led authorities through a rooftop chase before placing him under arrest. He was confined in the 41-bis prison regime, the strictest and most restrictive Italian prison regime, which included solitary confinement and continuous surveillance in a maximum-security jail. His cell included only a bed, a table and a stool, without access to television, radio or newspapers. Following Setola's arrest, the Casalesi clan was said to have been taken over by Michele Bidognetti, who himself was arrested in April 2009. Setola's older brother, Pasquale, was also in prison as of July 2009. In April 2011, the Court in Santa Maria Capua Vetere (Caserta) convicted Setola, Davide Granato, Alessandro Cirillo, Giovanni Letizia to life imprisonment and Antonio Alluce to 23 years for the Castel Volturno massacre. The Court recognized the existence of aggravating circumstances such as racial hatred and terrorist purposes.

He was re-elected in 1958, before making an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate in 1960 against Republican incumbent Karl Earl Mundt. After serving in the John F. Kennedy administration as director of the Food for Peace program, McGovern ran again for the Senate and narrowly prevailed over appointed Senator Joseph H. Bottum. In 1968, McGovern unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention and was re-elected to the Senate over former Governor of South Dakota Archie M. Gubbrud. In 1972, McGovern was successful in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, but lost the election in a landslide to incumbent President Richard Nixon. McGovern was re- elected to the Senate in 1974 over Vietnam War veteran Leo K. Thorsness, but lost re-election in 1980 to then-U.S. Representative James Abdnor.

In 1791 a new district was formed to include Greenville and Pendleton Counties. This was named the Washington District and it existed until 1799. In 1795 Robert Maxwell, a Revolutionary War hero, was appointed as Sheriff of the District. He lived in Greenville County, and was killed by an ambush on November 10, 1797 while crossing the Saluda River shoals where Piedmont Mill Dam was later built. His grave is located fifteen miles south of Greenville, near Ware Place. During this time many important public officials, including the Sheriff, were elected to their position by the Legislature. The people of South Carolina, however, felt that this important position should answer directly to them for his actions and performance. In 1808, legislation was enacted to provide for the election of the Sheriff by the citizens of the county, rather than by politicians. This method of election was placed into our State Constitution in 1868. The Office of Sheriff in Greenville County began. The Greenville County Sheriff's Office has transformed from the ancient office created over a thousand years ago in England, to a New World colony, to a frontier county, to a modern, computerized law enforcement agency serving a busy metropolitan county of over 451,000 residents. Administrative Services Division The Administrative Services Division is the Executive Branch of the Greenville County Sheriff's Office which oversees the entire operation of the Sheriff's Office. The fifty-two employees assigned to the Administrative Services Division provide support to the following units, which comprise this division: =Accreditation and Grants= This unit maintains our Law Enforcement Accreditation which is granted by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). The Greenville County Sheriff's Office was the first law enforcement agency in South Carolina to gain national accreditation in 1988 and has maintained this distinction ever since. National Accreditation insures that the citizens of Greenville County receive consistent, professional law enforcement services from the employees of the Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office seeks out grant funding which provides equipment and training while saving local tax dollars. Over the years many important programs have been funded through grant money. =Mazur Center for Advanced Training (CAT)= The Center for Advanced Training provides in- service and advanced training for all sworn deputies of the Sheriff's Office. In addition, the training center was the second law enforcement agency in the state chosen as a distance learning lab for the Criminal Justice Academy. This allows federal, state and local law enforcement to receive training without having to travel; thus allowing more officers to receive training while reducing the costs associated with training. The CAT has classroom space along with state of the art firing and driving ranges. =Chaplains= The Greenville County Sheriff's Office Chaplains serve the deputies of Greenville County. They provide Spiritual support and guidance, as well as stress counseling and stress debriefs. They also support the law enforcement community after hours and through family support and services. =Crime Stoppers= In June 1983, a group of concerned citizens and local media joined with law enforcement to form the County's first Crime Stoppers program. Our local chapter was modeled after the original Crime Stoppers program from 1976 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. By following their lead, Greenville's Crime Stoppers chapter has become successful and rewarding. Since the beginning of the Greenville Crime Stoppers program, countless callers have given information about criminal activity in their area. With this information, more than 5400 cases have been cleared, and more than 1700 individuals have been arrested. These arrests have led to the recovery of more than one million dollars of stolen goods. Even the availability of illegal drugs has been affected, since drugs valued at more than one million dollars were recovered due to Crime Stoppers leads. =E-911= E-911 provides quality 911 services to the residents of Greenville County. This office also maintains the county's Master Street Guide and provides support to all Public Safety Answering Points within the county. =Emergency Management= The role of Emergency Management is to coordinate resources and efforts to prepare for the response to large scale emergencies and disasters. The county's Emergency Operations Center is maintained by this group of employees. =K-9 Services= The Sheriff's Office K-9 Unit consists of 14 highly trained canines and their handlers. The K-9's are called upon frequently to conduct building searches, apprehend suspects, search for stolen items, guns and illegal drugs. They also assist in the search for lost or missing individuals. =Office of Professional Responsibility= The Office of Professional Standards is responsible for investigating employee related complaints and completing readiness inspections. In addition, polygraph examinations are performed for new hires and for criminal investigations. =Personnel and RecruitingPublic Affairs= The Public Affairs Unit is responsible for handling media inquiries, press releases, press conferences, public records requests and many special projects. =Safe Communities= Safe Communities is dedicated to communicating our Public Safety Mission to the community while responding to the safety concerns of our citizens. This unit participates in numerous coalitions addressing issues of crime prevention, domestic violence, traffic safety and underage drinking. =Technical Services Unit= The Technical Services Unit provides support services to deputies through geographical mapping, crime analysis and audio, photographic and video analysis. These services are critical to the successful conclusion of many cases. Community Services Division The Community Services Division is tasked with handling special projects within the Sheriff's Office. It encompasses several specialized units for different approaches to law enforcement. The units which make up the Community Services Division are Property Crimes, Community Patrol, Crime Prevention, Directed Patrol, Environmental Enforcement, Gang Investigations, School Enforcement, Swamp Rabbit Trail Patrol, Traffic Enforcement, Vice/Narcotics and Cadets. =Community Patrol= These deputies are assigned to various communities throughout Greenville County. Their primary mission is to resolve problems in those areas. They are often called upon to team up with other units to implement community strategies to resolve citizen's complaints. Deputies continually complete the verification of Sex Offender Addresses, Zest Quest with the schools, Compliance Checks with Enforcement of Underage Drinking Laws, and presentations with local Neighborhood Watch Groups. They serve on a variety of committees or coalitions. =Crime Prevention= As Communities seek ways to become involved in crime prevention, the Sheriff's Office has seen an increase in the requests for Neighborhood Watch and other safety programs. This unit can provide training on internet safety, personal safety, \\"stranger danger,\\" senior citizen safety, and many other programs. =Directed Patrol Unit= The Directed Patrol Unit (DPU) focuses on street level issues that affect the community as a whole. This ranges from undercover operations, targeting prostitution, and street level drug sales to nuisance business complaints. This unit has the flexibility and knowledge to deal with whatever problems arise as well as assist in locating people and arresting those with outstanding warrants. They are also used to identify potential gang members, which provides information to investigators and makes an impact on gang activities seen across the county. =Environmental Services= The Environmental Services Unit responds to and investigates all crimes involving litter and hazardous dumping within the county. They also oversee the public service workers in their clean-up activities, as well as assisting Vice and Narcotics with the clean-up of Methamphetamine manufacturing sites which are considered hazardous materials sites. =Property Crimes= The Property Crimes Unit investigates burglaries, auto-breakings, larcenies, and other property related offenses. There are 12 investigators assigned to the Property Crimes Unit. =School Resource Officers= School Resource Officers (SROs) are law enforcement officers assigned to the school district. This unit is made up of high school and middle school SROs as well as a floating SRO, and three investigators. Not only does this unit serve the 9 middle schools and 7 high schools in the county, it also serves 33 elementary schools, 2 career centers, 3 alternative schools, 2 Child Development Centers, 2 specialized educational facilities and provides 74 crossing guards for elementary and middle schools in Greenville County. An SRO's responsibilities include; law enforcement, teaching law related classes, counseling students, and educating parents and staff. The three investigators investigate crimes that occur in locations where an SRO is not present, handle school district employee allegations and conduct in-depth investigations that would otherwise pull an SRO away from their assigned school. The investigators also conduct educational presentations concerning gangs and drugs. =Traffic Enforcement= Traffic Enforcement patrols the highways and roadways of Greenville County. This group of 16 deputies focuses their efforts on reducing the number traffic related fatalities and its largest contributing factor which is Driving Under the Influence. The Traffic Unit is a participating member of multi-jurisdictional task forces. Some of these task forces are county level and some are state level. They participate in several state and national traffic campaigns such as Sober or Slammer, Buckle Up South Carolina, HEAT and Operation Thunderbolt. =Vice / Narcotics= The Vice and Narcotics Unit conducts investigations related to illegal drugs and gambling in Greenville County. They continue to work more highly complex cases involving multiple defendants with more emphasis placed on investigating and dismantling entire organizations. Many investigations are conducted with state and federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and ATF. Additionally, they maintain a full-time position with the DEA Task Force. This allows ready access to a wide variety of information and asset sharing programs that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. In addition, this has resulted in numerous indictments related on federal drug charges. The Vice & Narcotics Unit is also tasked with investigating methamphetamine cases and suspected meth labs within the county. = Cadet Program = The Sheriff's Office Cadet Program is an extension of the Boy Scouts Explorer program. The Cadet Program allows teens interested in law enforcement to receive a firsthand account of the profession. The cadets have been involved with multiple community service events and several hundred hours of community service work. Cadets participate in a large number of training classes that teach them a variety of law enforcement skills and prepare them for careers in criminal justice. Uniform Patrol Division Uniform Patrol is the front line in the battle against crime in Greenville County. Uniform Patrol is where new deputies start their career. Typically the new deputies start with orientation before going to the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy for twelve weeks of intensive training. The deputies return to Uniform Patrol for an equally intensive 14 weeks of field training before they assume duties as a solo unit. The Uniform Patrol Division consists of Uniform Deputies, Follow-up Team and Communications Center. =Uniform Patrol= Uniform Patrol deputies are the first responders to emergency and non-emergency dispatched calls for service and incidents they observe while on patrol. Uniform Patrol deputies are assigned to 5 platoons. Four platoons rotate between day and night shifts every six weeks while the fifth platoon is assigned to work an overlapping shift during the highest call volume times of the day. All deputies work 12-hour shifts to ensure the maximum coverage within the beat areas they are working. =Follow-Up Team= The Follow-up team consists of 3 uniformed deputies. The team provides support to Uniform Patrol Deputies by aiding in street level investigations. This frees up Uniform Patrol Deputies to respond to more calls for service from the community. Multiple cases have been cleared and many items have been seized due to the extra time these officers were able to dedicate to these cases. =Communications Center= The Communications Center consists of call takers, dispatchers, dispatch training officers, false alarm billing, NCIC teletype, and tape research. Working in communications is a very demanding and critical job within law enforcement and the dispatchers are the lifeline to the deputies in the field. They process, on average, over 600,000 calls and dispatch over 190,000 calls for service per year. Criminal Investigations Division The Criminal Investigations Division (CID) is composed of 40 Sworn Full Time Deputies and 13 Civilian Employees. This Division is compiled of 14 different units which are: Arson, Auto Theft, Cold Case, Crimes Against Children, Data Recovery, Economic Crimes, Family Violence, Homicide, Missing Persons, Juvenile Crimes, Robbery, Sex Crimes, Sex Offender Registry, and Victim/Witness Advocates. =Arson= The Arson Unit consists of two full-time investigators who investigate cases involving burned property and/or explosions. They are also available to all the Fire Chiefs of Greenville County when fires are deemed suspicious in nature. =Auto Theft= The Auto Theft Unit investigates cases of Auto Theft, Use of Vehicle without Owner's Consent, and Chop Shops. This unit is staffed with four full-time investigators. =Cold Case= The Cold Case Unit investigates unsolved violent crimes. The investigators review the original case file, re-interview witnesses and victims and follow up on any new leads. New forensic techniques applied to evidence can add a fresh perspective. Some current investigations date back into the 1960s. =Crimes Against Children= In recognition of the fact that the victims of sexual assault are now predominantly children and that these investigations along with child abuse and neglect cases are similar in nature, the Crimes against Children Unit was created. =Data Recovery= The Data Recovery Unit investigates computer crimes and internet predator cases within Greenville County. They also have the ability to retrieve evidentiary data from computers and phones which is crucial in the successful prosecution of criminal cases. The Data Recovery investigators also conduct monthly internet safety classes upon request. =Economic Crimes= The Economic Crimes Unit investigates cases of Fraud, Forgery and Computer Crimes. This unit consists of five investigators. =Family Violence= The Family Violence Unit investigates serious cases of Domestic Abuse. These investigators tie cases together for graduated sentences during prosecution in court. =Homicide= The Homicide Unit investigates homicides, suicides, accidental and natural deaths, attempted suicides, missing persons and serious assaults. This unit consists of seven investigators who are on call day and night. =Youth Services= The Youth Services Unit investigates crimes involving the arrest of juveniles, as well as child neglect or abuse cases. This unit has five full-time investigators who work closely with the Department of Social Services, Department of Juvenile Justice, and the Juvenile Solicitor with Family Court. =Missing Persons= The Missing Persons Unit works to locate adults that have been reported missing in Greenville County. =Robbery= The Robbery Unit investigates cases of Armed Robbery, Strong Arm Robbery, Attempted Armed Robbery and Carjacking. This unit is staffed with four full-time investigators. =Sex Crimes= The Sex Crimes Unit investigates cases of Criminal Sexual Conduct, Attempted Criminal Sexual Conduct, Lewd Act Offenses, Indecent Exposure, and Sexual Assaults. This unit is staffed with three full-time investigators. =Sex Offender Registry= The Sex Offender Registry maintains current contact and location information on all convicted Sex Offenders within Greenville County, including the municipalities. =Victim/Witness Advocates= The Victim Advocates Unit helps the victims of crimes from the incident date all the way through the trial. The role of an advocate is quite unique. Though they are not investigators, their role in the Criminal Justice System is quite simple. They guide survivors of crime through the aftermath of the traumatic event 24 hours a day through crisis intervention, financial assistance, referrals to service agencies in our area. They also provide information on the Criminal Justice System, as well as serving as a liaison between the survivor and the investigator. Judicial Services Division The Judicial Services Division is responsible for arrest warrant service, court security, service of civil processes, fugitive apprehension and extradition, arrest warrant and courtesy summons data entry and maintenance, and prisoner and mental health transports. =Civil Process= The deputies assigned to the Civil Process Unit serve civil papers throughout Greenville County. These papers include Orders of Protection, Orders of Immediate Possession, Writ of Assistance, Decree of Foreclosure and Sales, and Property Levees. =Court Security= Our court deputies work tirelessly to ensure secure courthouses for judges, courthouse employees, and our citizens. Applying a \\"team\\" approach, our courthouses have become statewide models. Family Court and General Sessions Court deputies screen over 365,000 people annually through their magnetometers. =Extradition= The Extradition Unit travels across the United States to bring offenders to justice. Deputies must make arrangements with other agencies and secure the most appropriate method of travel for return to Greenville County for prosecution. =Fugitive= The Fugitive Unit is tasked with the apprehension of Greenville's most dangerous defendants. They work with several of the Sheriff's Office units to complete their assignments. =Transport= Deputies are tasked with transporting individuals throughout the state. Over 14,000 prisoners a year are transported between State Department of Corrections facilities and local courtrooms. Juvenile Offenders are transported to and from Department of Juvenile Justice facilities. Deputies also transport court ordered mental patients to and from mental hospitals within the state. =Warrants= The Warrants Unit is responsible for the receipt, entry, service and return of arrest warrants within Greenville County. Selective Enforcement Division * The Air Support Unit operates four aircraft which support the Sheriff's Office. The unit is equipped with three helicopters: one Bell OH-58C (\\"Saber 1\\"), one Bell 206B III, and one Bell UH-1H (\\"Saber 3\\"), and a Cessna 182 airplane (\\"Saber 2\\"). Law Enforcement Aviation is a unique tool that can provide a bird's eye view during searches, crime scene photography and general patrol. In 2011, Saber 1 responded to 157 calls for service and was the first on the scene to 90 of those calls. Saber 1 assisted in apprehending 55 suspects and was called out 35 times. Saber 2 conducted photo surveillance flights and transported prisoners from Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida back to Greenville County. Saber 3 participated in 4 Emergency Response Team trainings. * The Chemical Ordnance Biological Radiological Assessment (C.O.B.R.A.) Team is trained to handle and rapidly respond to assist jurisdictions in effectively addressing the consequences of a critical incident involving Weapons of Mass Destruction and Toxic Industrial Chemicals. The team is equipped to secure the area of a mass casualty event as well as provide investigative support. The Sheriff's Office COBRA Team currently has twelve members. The team members are from law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical personnel. The COBRA Team can accomplish this mission in collaboration with the support of other entities such as local, state and federal resources. The COBRA Team may also be utilized to respond to technological and natural incidents in which the team's training, equipment, and experience can be effectively utilized. * The Color Guard / Honor Guard team is called upon to present the colors at important ceremonies, events, conferences, special church services and community parades. They also post honors for officers who die in the line of duty, retire flags at special ceremonies and represent the Sheriff at funerals within the law enforcement community. * The Dive Team is ready at all times to respond to any water related emergencies including swift water rescue, underwater crime scenes, body, evidence and stolen property recovery. The Dive Team completed monthly training activities and specialized training programs during the year. The team has 8 certified divers and 6 ground crew members available for call out. Most team members are Swift Water certified while some have advanced certifications in Swift Water and High Angle rescue. * The Field Force team is composed of 175 deputies from Uniform Patrol and the Judicial Services Division. Field Force team members are trained for quick response to civil unrest, crowd control and high risk officer rescue situations. They work in squad formations that provide a unified, highly functional and disciplined presence to assist in restoration of peace in our communities. Outfitted with the latest in crowd control munitions, deputies are trained in the proper deployment for ultimate effectiveness. * The Hazardous Devices Unit (\\"Bomb Squad\\") has 5 technicians and 3 support personnel along with an Explosive Detection K-9. Thanks to a grant program this unit is well equipped with the latest technology and tools. The Hazardous Devices Unit responds on average to sixty calls per year with another 20-30 additional K-9 responses. * The purpose and mission of the Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T.) team is to handle high-risk operations in a manner that reduces the chance of violence, injury, or death. High-risk situations include hostage incidents, barricaded suspects, sniper/active shooters, high-risk warrants, manhunt operations, or other tactical problems. The team is staffed by deputies who have demonstrated the skills and commitment needed to perform this important task. They train a minimum of 230 hours yearly in addition to specialized schools that they may attend. Team members are always on-call and perform their SWAT duties in addition to their regular primary assignment. * Chaplains provide Spiritual support and guidance, as well as stress counseling and stress debriefs. They also support the law enforcement community after hours and through family support and services. Their mission is the personal well being of all who serve. Misconduct As of 2017, Sheriff Will Lewis is suspended for misconduct, perjury and obstruction of justice. These charges came out of a sexual assault lawsuit filed by Lewis‚Äô female assistant. Although the sheriff said the relationship was consensual, he settled the claim for an undisclosed sum. Governor Henry McMaster lacks the authority to fire a sheriff unless he has been convicted of a crime, although he has said he would have preferred to remove Lewis from office.

Goldschmidt led the establishment of Oregon Shines, a strategic plan consisting of three goals and recommendations on their implementation. He then created the OPB, to keep Oregonians' attention on the goals, issue biennial reports on progress, and perform periodic updates to the plan.http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/OPB/os.shtml#Oregon_Shines__1989_ Oregon Shines was written in 1989 and updated in 1997. Private foundations contributed at least $20,000 to perform the third revision in time for the Oregon Sesquicentennial in 2009. The initial \\"Oregon Benchmarks\\" report listed 103 benchmarks against which state agencies were to chart their progress. As of 2005, the number of benchmarks listed was 90. Goldschmidt stated at the program's inception: \\"The Oregon Benchmark project is a tool to keep Oregon on track. Oregon will be the first state to hold itself accountable to its visions for the future.\\" In 2005, the OPB conducted a survey that found that 85% of Oregonians did not know the biggest source of revenue (income tax) or the biggest expenditure category (education) of the state. Commenting on the general lack of understanding of the state budget revealed by the poll, pollster Adam Davis observed that \\"This state of affairs poses a virtually insuperable barrier to any kind of major reform of our tax system or array of public services. Any effort to raise taxes for any purpose runs into the same problem: 'Can't you just prioritize and cut out the unimportant stuff?'\\" As of its 2009 report, the OPB listed its benchmarks in seven categories. After the 2009 report was completed, funding for the Board was cut and the state discontinued monitoring the benchmarks.

It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2007. History BONUS was a prototype whose objective was to assess the economic and technical feasibility of the integral boiling superheating concept. The construction of BONUS started in 1960, and the reactor had its first controlled nuclear chain reaction on April 13, 1964. In September 1965 full power operation was achieved with 50 MW thermal power, and steam temperatures of 900¬∞F (482¬∞C). Operation of the BONUS reactor was terminated in June 1968 because of technical difficulties and the ensuing need for high-cost modifications. The Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority decommissioned the reactor between 1969 and 1970. During decommissioning, all special nuclear materials (fuel) and certain highly activated components (e.g., control rods and shims) were removed from the island to the US mainland, all piping systems were flushed, the reactor vessel and associated internal components within the biological shield were entombed in concrete and grout, and systems external to the entombment were decontaminated. Many contaminated and activated materials were placed in the main circulation pump room beneath the pressure vessel and entombed in concrete. General decontamination of the reactor was performed with the goal of meeting unrestricted use criteria in all accessible areas of the building. Residual radioactive materials remaining in the structure were isolated or shielded to protect site visitors and workers. During subsequent years, more radioactive contamination was identified in portions of the building, and additional clean-up and shielding activities were conducted in the 1990s and early 2000s. Operation Perspective of the BONUS containment building in Puerto Rico The reactor is one of two boiling-water superheater developed in the United States. The principle of operation is boiling water in the center of reactor (likewise BWR) and passing this steam by the rest of reactor, superheating this steam to drive a turbine generator.

A faculty member at the University of Queensland, he is a recipient of the Prime Minister's Prize for Science and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science and the Royal Society (elected 2001). Early life and education Srinivasan was born in Poona, India in 1948. His early interests included making transistor radios with his father. His family moved to Calcutta and Delhi before settling in Bangalore, where Srinivasan completed his schooling in 1962. In tertiary education, he earned a number of degrees in the years following: * 1967 - Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Bangalore University (5-year degree) * 1970 - Master's degree in Applied Electronics and Servo mechanisms, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India * 1973 - M.Phil. in Engineering and Applied Science, Yale University * 1977 - PhD in Engineering and Applied Science, Yale University * 1994 - DSc in Neuroethology, Australian National University Career After completing his PhD in the US, Srinivasan moved to Canberra in 1978 to take up a position at the Departments of Neurobiology and Applied Mathematics at the Australian National University (ANU), where he stayed until 1982, when he secured a research position in Zurich, Switzerland, to work on insect behaviour. It was here that he learnt how to train and work with honeybees. In 1985 he returned to the ANU, and set up an interdisciplinary research group which focused on investigating how bees use their vision to navigate and land very precisely. In 2007, Srinivisan took up a position working at the Queensland Brain Institute and the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering of the University of Queensland. Research interests At Yale, Srinivasan did research on movement perception in flies, and became interested in the vision of insects. Focusing his attention on honey bees, in particular the Western honey bee, Srinivasan has explored how simple animal systems display complex behaviours. This broad field has applications in robotics, especially unmanned aerial vehicles because of the competing needs for autonomy and a lightweight control system. Bees are highly competent fliers. Srinivasan has shown that many ostensibly complex flight behaviours can be attributed to the tendency of the bee to keep optic flow constant. Some examples: * They measure the distance they have travelled. This is important as distance is signalled to other bees as a component of the waggle dance. * When landing, the ground becomes closer and therefore appears to be moving faster. By keeping the apparent velocity of the ground constant, the bee reduces its own velocity in a continuous manner. * Similarly, bees slow down in a crowded landscape because nearby objects appear to move faster than objects on the horizon. This is a safety mechanism that reduces the incidence of collision. * When avoiding objects, the bee will tend to take the optimal path because it will 'balance' the rate of the optic flow between the eyes. It will, for example, fly down the middle of a tunnel, because if it flew closer to one side the optic flow would appear to be greater. Srinivasan's research looks maily at \\"vision, perception and cognition in animals with simple nervous systems, and on how these might be used in machine vision and robotics\\". Awards and honours Srinivasan's work has been recognised and honoured by a number of awards and honours, including: *1995 - Election to the Fellowship of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA) *2001 - Inaugural Australian Federation Fellowship award of the Australian Research Council *2001 - Australasian Science Prize (for excellence in peer- reviewed research) *2001 - Election to the Fellowship of the Royal Society of London (FRS) *2003 - Australian Centenary Medal *2006 - Royal Society of New Zealand Distinguished Visitor *2006 - Fellowship of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World *2008 - Queensland Smart State Premier's Fellowship *2008 - Rank Prize for Optoelectronics (UK) *2009 - Distinguished Alumni Award of the Indian Institute of Science *2012 - Membership of the Order of Australia (AM) Publications , Srinivasan had authored 15 book chapters, 189 journal articles, 69 conference papers, and had registered two patents. The patents were registered with co-authors Javaan Singh Chahl and other researchers: a \\"novel system for panoramic video surveillance\\" in 1997, and an imaging system in 2002 (US).

Hurricane Georges was a Category 2 storm in the 1998 Hurricane season. Background Track of Hurricane Georges Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa in mid-September, 1998. Tracking towards the west, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September 16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges and further to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Over the following five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, causing over 600 fatalities, mainly in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. By September 25, Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Shortly after landfall, the hurricane significantly slowed with forward motion reducing to a general drift towards the east. Georges dissipated on October 1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida. Preparations Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico on September 25, a hurricane watch was issued for the entire coastline of Mississippi. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning as Georges neared the Gulf Coast. On September 28, the hurricane warning was lowered to a tropical storm warning. All watches and warnings were discontinued on September 29 as Georges weakened to a tropical depression. Many citizens in southern Mississippi were told to leave due to a mandatory or recommended evacuation. Of those in the evacuation area, 60% actually left. Most of those who stayed remained because they believed their house was safe enough for the storm. Of those who left, most went to a relative's house in their own county. Impact Old Hwy 67 and MS 15 near their intersection near D'Iberville on September 29 due to overflow from the Tchoutacabouffa River Upon making landfall, Hurricane Georges brought a storm surge of up to 8.9 feet (2.7 m) in Biloxi, Mississippi. While stalling over the southern portion of the state, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to 16.7 inches (420 mm) in Pascagoula. The heavy rainfall contributed to significant river overflowing, including the Tchoutacabouffa River at D'Iberville, which set a record crest of 19 feet (5.7 m). The overflown rivers in the southern portion of the state flooded homes and forced more to evacuate just days after the hurricane came through. In addition, squall lines spawned multiple tornadoes, damaging evacuation shelters in Pascagoula and Gautier. Beach erosion occurred along the coastline, resulting in some property damage on beach houses. Around Biloxi, coastal casinos and the shipyards experienced little from the storm. Inland, high winds and flooding caused extensive damage to homes. Georges's winds downed power lines, leaving 230,000 without power after the storm. After the storm, over 6,800 people stayed in 49 different shelters. One shelter in Forrest County was damaged, forcing the citizens to another camp. The shelters experienced roof damage and severe power outages, though one problem that could not be overcome was the language barrier with immigrants. Overall, Hurricane Georges caused $676.8 million (1998 USD, $894.5 million 2009 USD) in damage, though no deaths due to well-executed evacuations. Aftermath Including relief funds to Puerto Rico and Louisiana, a total of $14,150,532 in paid losses was reported by FEMA.

She was for most of her life a member of the Freedom Press publishing collective.Walter, Nicolas, \\"Lilian Wolfe 1875‚Äì1974\\", in Early life and radicalisation Wolfe was born in her father's jewellery shop on Edgware Road, London on 22 December 1875. Her mother, Lucy Helen Jones, was an actress from Birmingham whom Wolfe would describe as \\"a very frustrated woman\\" who left the family when Wolfe was thirteen years of age in order tour the world with an operatic company, while her father, Albert Lewis Woolf was a Liverpudlian jeweller of Jewish descent and of a conservative outlook. She had three brothers and two sisters, and had a comfortable and orthodox middle- class upbringing, educated first by governesses and later for a short period at the Regent Street Polytechnic. As an employee of the General Post Office, Wolfe was an active member of the Civil Service Socialist Society. She became disillusioned with parliamentary politics as a suffragette, and came to consider the granting of the voting franchise to women a mere \\"palliative\\". She was thus attracted to the British anarchist movement and was a founding contributor to the anarchist periodical The Voice of Labour. Activism and later years In 1916, following the introduction of conscription by the Military Service Act, The Voice of Labour published an article on civil disobedience which encouraged readers to dodge the draft and go into hiding in the Scottish Highlands. Wolfe was arrested during a subsequent raid of Freedom offices along with her partner Thomas Keell. They were charged and found guilty under the Defence of the Realm Act. Wolfe received a sentence of a ¬£25 fine or two months in prison. She chose the latter. Keell too chose prison over payment, though his sentence was for ¬£100 or three months respectively. In prison however, the forty-year-old Wolfe discovered that she was pregnant and so paid the fine and secured her release. She lived in Marsh House in London with Nellie Dick, Fred Dunn, and Gaston Marin in 1917, with Keell, their son and W C Owen in Willesden around 1920,Becker, Heiner, \\"W C Owen 1854‚Äì1929\\", in and with Keell in the Tolstoyan Whiteway Colony, Gloucestershire from the 1920s until his death in 1938. At Whiteway, she cared for a time for Richard Blair, the son of George Orwell, when the writer was incapacitated in a sanitorium. When Vernon Richards established the periodical Spain and the World in support of the Spanish anarchists in the civil war, Wolfe (aged 60) acted as its administrator. During this time, she would stay in with Richards and his partner Marie-Louise Berneri in London. She was still politically active well into her old age, selling Peace News in her 90s and acting as manager and administrator of the Freedom Press bookshop until the age of 95. In the centennial edition of Freedom, anarchist historian Nicolas Walter hailed Wolfe as \\"one of the least public but most important figures in the Freedom Press for more than half a century\\".

The third named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Cristobal formed on July 19 from a trough of low pressure off the Southeast U.S. Coast. In a marginally favorable environment, it attained minimal tropical storm status later that day. The storm remained offshore, and peaked as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras. It accelerated northeast parallel to the East Coast and became extratropical on July 23 near Nova Scotia. Because it was a weak storm and never made landfall, Cristobal's effects were mostly limited to moderate rainfall. The storm dropped 3.43 in (87 mm) of rain in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding was reported. Additionally, the extratropical remnants contributed to rainfall on Nova Scotia which caused some street and basement flooding. Meteorological history On July 14, 2008 a weakening surface trough extended across northern Florida, producing thunderstorms across the state. A weak low pressure area developed on July 15 near Tallahassee, which moved southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on July 16 it crossed onshore near Tampa, and development was not anticipated due to land interaction. Late on July 17, however, convection increased in association with the low, and the system quickly became better organized. Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that a tropical depression was developing, with its convection becoming more concentrated around a circulation; at 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300 UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. Located between a ridge to its southeast and northwest, the depression moved slowly northeastward, and with a marginally favorable upper-level environment, it attained minimal tropical storm status during the early afternoon of July 19. Initially fairly disorganized with little deep convection, dry air in the mid- to-upper-levels of the atmosphere prevented immediate intensification. However, late on July 20 thunderstorm activity increased. Cristobal remained a fairly weak tropical storm as it tracked adjacent to the Carolina coast, and the storm never made landfall. It reached peak intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras, and remained such over the warm Gulf Stream waters as convection became strong over the southern portion of the circulation. Beginning to enter cooler waters, the cyclone accelerated east- northeastward on July 21 and July 22. On the afternoon of July 22, Cristobal began to weaken south of Nova Scotia. In the evening hours, satellite imagery indicated that the mid-level center became separated from the low-level center. The storm's cloud pattern became disorganized, and by July 23 it had completed an extratropical transition. The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system at 5:00 am EDT (0900 UTC) on July 23. Preparations Tropical Depression Three, prior to being named In anticipation of Tropical Storm Cristobal, a tropical storm warning was issued for coastal areas from the South Santee River in South Carolina to the North Carolina‚ÄìVirginia Border. The advisory was discontinued on July 20 as Cristobal pulled away from land. Flood advisories were declared for parts of North Carolina. National Weather Service forecasters advised against swimming due to high seas and potential rip currents. Environment Canada issued rain warnings throughout portions of Nova Scotia. Impact Prior to forming, the precursor low dropped light to moderate rainfall across the state of Florida. In Lake Wales, 6 inches (150 mm) of precipitation was reported, most of which fell within the period of two hours. The sudden, heavy rainfall clogged storm drains, causing some street flooding. Up to 40 cars were pulled from flooded streets, some being submerged with 2 ft (0.6 m) of water. Damages from the flooding was estimated at $10,000. In Georgia, the storm produced of rain, while in South Carolina, was recorded. On July 20, Cristobal skirted eastern North Carolina, resulting in minimal damage. Along the coast, water levels rose above normal; rough surf was also reported. Rainfall averaged , though the NEXRAD weather radar estimates indicated that isolated amounts exceeded . The storm dropped in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding occurred. Because the bulk of the storm remained over open waters, winds along the coast ran about . While the center of Cristobal was more than a day away from the Canadian Maritimes, moisture extended ahead of the cyclone and became enhanced by a stalled frontal system. As a result, heavy rainfall fell along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. At Baccaro Point, 224 mm (8.8 in) of rain was reported, while 145 mm (5.8 in) fell at Sambro, near Halifax. The rain flooded basements and streets in the Cape Sable area. A sailor from Connecticut was rescued to the southeast of Halifax when his ship capsized in stormy seas. The highest winds remained offshore, though a buoy recorded gusts to .

It focuses on the fields of Acting, Dance, and Entertainment Technology (audio and video). Each class in FPAC is referred to as a 'level' (i.e. freshmen are called 'level ones,' sophomores are 'level twos,' etc.). A common misconception is that FPAC is an after-school activity, when in reality it takes the place of a child's elective class, and in the cases of a Dance or Acting major, their gym class as well.  Selection process  Students are admitted into FPAC through a highly selective process during their eighth grade. Admission criteria include: an online application and audition, two teachers' recommendations, an out-of-school recommendation, academic records (including seventh and eighth-grade report cards), and an essay written to express the student's interest in FPAC. Sixty-two students are admitted into the Level One class. Approximately eighteen dancers, twenty actors, and twenty-four E.T. students will be accepted.  Education  All students in FPAC must meet the graduation requirements of the Freehold Regional High School District to graduate. They are also strongly enforced to keep their grades above a B- Final Grade for each subject, and failure to do so will result in being asked to leave the program. Failure to abide by school rules you also may be asked to leave the program. Along with rules FPAC has a strict attendance policy asking students to be absent on 3-4 times a marking period. Actual classes offered to FPAC students vary by major (Acting, Dance, or Entertainment Technology) and by grade, however actors take dance and voice classes as well as dance majors take acting and voice classes, to promote balanced and well-rounded performers.

Brenson, Michael. \\"New Portland Museum Pursues a Human Scale.\\" The New York Times. 9 Aug. 1983, Late City Final Edition, sec. C: 13. Henry N. Cobb (of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) designed the Payson Building, which introduced over five times more gallery space than in the adjacent, historic PMA buildings (McLellan-Sweat House, Charles Quincy Clapp House, and L. D. M. Sweat Memorial Galleries). Cobb, Henry Nichols. Where I stand: Lecture. Cambridge: Graduate School Of Design, Harvard University, 1981. The building opened in 1983, after Mr. Payson donated 17 Winslow Homer paintings and ten million dollars to the museum. Thorn, Megan. Charles Shipman Payson Building. Portland: The Portland Museum Of Art, 1983. Similar in theme to these Homer paintings, the Payson building contains a collection of contemporary paintings and short-term exhibitions created by Maine artists, focusing on regional themes. Conforti, Joseph A. Creating Portland: History and Place in Northern New England (Revisiting New Eng. Hanover: University Press of New England, 2005. Exterior design details Cobb‚Äôs largest challenge was to create a building that provided an enjoyable and powerful location to view art, while relating to the diverse conditions of its awkwardly shaped urban site. The tall brick buildings enclosing the other sides of Congress Square required the Payson building to contain a unified, strong, large-scale presence. Conversely the smaller, historic PMA buildings on the Spring Street side of the build site required the Payson Building to have a smaller-building form that would accommodate these historic neighbors. Cobb‚Äôs solution was to design a wide fa√ßade made of red brick and gray granite lintels with semicircle openings. This forceful fa√ßade has the street presence of a Renaissance palazzo, enclosing the public square. Behind the fa√ßade Cobb gradually reduced both the height and length of the building until the building terminated in the back left corner, one fourth as wide and tall as the main fa√ßade. By stepping the building back and down in this way, Cobb was successfully able to grant primacy to the neighboring historic buildings. Cobb chose to comprise the structure of the Payson Building of a concrete frame with concrete block infill, rendering the fa√ßade essentially a ‚Äúcurtain wall.‚Äù This led to criticism from other architects that Cobb gave the building a false, billboard-like, front. Campbell, Robert. ‚ÄúModules Stacked Behind a ‚ÄòBillboard‚Äô.‚Äù American Architecture of the 1980s. Washington, D.C.: The American Institute of Architects Press, 1990. Cobb claims, however, that the fa√ßade symbolically represents the interior. The circular insets and cutouts are metaphors that recall the square interior galleries and the rectangular brick insets signify the rectangular interior circulation spaces. Schmertz, Mildred F. \\"Form and figure; The Portland Museum of Art, Charles Shipman Payson Building, Portland, Maine.\\" Architectural Record 171.13 (1983): 108‚Äì199. Interior design details Behind the controversial fa√ßade lie many galleries with clean white walls and pine floors with granite stripping set into the floor. This granite marks off twenty-foot by twenty-foot spaces, thought by Cobb to be the smallest desirable gallery space. Around these square spaces, granite strips also delineate rectangular circulation spaces around each square. Over certain granite strips, Cobb placed walls with wide cutout doors to shape various sized gallery spaces. To reflect and accommodate the diversity of the Homer paintings, Cobb not only strategically placed walls to create different sized gallery spaces, but also varied the ceiling height from 12.5 to 25 to 37.5 feet (3.8‚Äì11.4 m) high. These diverse gallery spaces were intentionally designed to provide no clear path through the museum. Cobb claimed that this layout reflected the lack of ordering grand boulevards and grids in the modest cities of New England. Further, Cobb‚Äôs layout of the galleries allows a visitor standing in one gallery to see glimpses of several other galleries, often on multiple levels, through the wide gallery doors. This gives the visitor a sense of adventure and anticipation as he or she travels through the galleries. Perhaps the most compelling feature of the galleries is the lighting, rivaling that of Louis Kahn‚Äôs Kimball Gallery. The galleries are lit with cascading domed ceilings, which are filled with daylight from superimposed octagonal clerestory lanterns based on the Dulwich College Art Gallery by John Soane. Clerestories permit maximum sunlight to enter the gallery while avoiding direct rays hitting the gallery walls. This natural light is accompanied by incandescent track lighting, although this artificial lighting is often left off during the day. The shifting light entering the museum animates, diffuses, and shapes the galleries below, celebrating the museum's collections with ‚ÄúPortland Light.‚Äù Historical inspirations In designing the Payson Building, many significant works of modern architecture influenced Cobb. The fa√ßades of Kahn‚Äôs Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, India (semicircle openings, large sections of plain brick) and Kahn‚Äôs Phillips Exeter Academy Library arcade in New Hampshire partially inspired the fa√ßade of the Payson building. The famous lighting from the Dulwich Picture Gallery, the Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth, and the lanterns of Ely Cathedral inspired lighting for the Payson Building. Further influences include a portico by Ledoux, the Doge‚Äôs Palace in Venice, and other precedents. Regionalism Beyond these more famous influences, Cobb also had a strong desire to link the Payson building to Maine. He remarked, ‚ÄúThe Portland Museum is a regional museum in a region that is itself a museum, so I believe I had an obligation to connect the new building to the city and the region.‚Äù To express the museum‚Äôs connection to Maine, Cobb used locally made materials common to Maine (water-struck brick, pine, and granite) as his chief design materials. These materials call to the vernacular architecture of Portland, defined by the brick commercial buildings and warehouses of the Old Port and the Federal style brick buildings near the museum. Furthermore, from the ground looking up at the Payson building, one is struck with how the fa√ßade‚Äôs semicircular openings encase the air and light of Maine, making it part of the building. A similar effect is achieved with the building‚Äôs many octagonal clerestories. These clerestories also recall the viewing decks of the region‚Äôs lighthouses as well as the octagonal Portland Observatory, a major city icon. Additionally, porthole-like windows reveal views of the Fore River recalling Maine‚Äôs rich nautical history.

BiographyEarly life= He was born in Wellington, and educated at Christchurch Boys' High School and Nelson College. He was an industrial chemist, and founded his cosmetics and toiletries manufacturing company Wilfrid Owen New Zealand Limited in 1938. He was a resident of Sumner, Christchurch. In 1924 he married Ethel Amie Gough, with whom he had two children. During World War II he served in the home guard. He had many community interests and was a lifelong member of the Canterbury Jockey Club, the Christchurch Businessman's Club and the Canterbury Officers' Club. =Political career= Owen entered politics via local body affairs. He was elected as a member of the Sumner Borough Council as an independent candidate. He remained a member until 1945 when Sumner was amalgamated with the Christchurch City Council. In the early 1930s he developed an interest in the monetary reform ideas of C. H. Douglas and joined the Social Credit association. He was one of 12 delegates at a summit in 1952 to promote a political wing of the association. At the associations conference in 1953 the formation of a political wing was unanimously supported, albeit reluctantly rather than supporting other parties. He became the leader of Social Credit Party in 1953. Under his leadership Social Credit got a surprising 11% of the party vote in the 1954 general election. Owen stood himself for Social Credit in in the and , coming third with 2,675 and 1,014 votes respectively; and in the . The main impact he achieved as leader was induce the government to establish the Royal Commission on Money and Baking in 1956 to investigate Social Credits claims that the country's financial system was malfunctioning. During the investigations bankers admitted that banks actually create credit, a claim they previously disputed. Support dropped to 7% in the 1957 general election. For that and for the criticism of Social Credit by the Royal Commission (which Owen had not attended, as he was overseas) he was criticised at the 1958 conference, and he resigned from the leadership shortly after in 1959. The Social Credit Party suffered a very public split between supporters of leader Vernon Cracknell and his deputy John O'Brien. Owen surprisingly sided with O'Brien who eventually lead a walkout and formed the splinter New Democratic Party. In the Owen stood in for the New Democratic Party, and came fifth with 288 votes (the Social Credit candidate came third). He rejoined the Social Credit Party and remained a member until he died. He was not made a life member (probably due to his support of O'Brien in the 1970s schism) but was a member of the Lyttelton branch. =Death= He died in Princess Margaret Hospital, Christchurch aged 86, survived by his wife and two sons.

It is a member of the PHINMA Education Network (PEN). It offers practically all undergraduate and graduate courses that Metro Manila universities offer. It has a staff of about 300 faculty members and employees. History Facade =Dagupan Institute= The University of Pangasinan started operation in 1925 as the Dagupan Institute, which offered elementary, secondary and vocational courses. It was founded by Dean Francisco Benitez of the University of the Philippines, who became the chairman of the Board of Directors; Dr. Blas F. Rayos; Dr. Apolinario delos Santos, then President of the University of Manila; Dr. Mariano delos Santos, then Dean of the University of Manila; Dr. Sylvestre Pascual; and Dr. Blas F. Rayos, then Dean of the College of Education of the University of Manila. Rayos became the president of the school and headed it for 45 years until 1975 when he died and was succeeded by his son, George O. Rayos, who served as president until 1987. In 1937, the College of Liberal Arts was established with the president Blas F. Rayos Sr. as its first dean. =Dagupan Junior College= In 1941, the school was renamed the Dagupan Junior College. Its operation was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II in December 1941. It resumed operation in 1945 immediately after the war. Four courses were added to its offering soon after. These were Civil Engineering, Architecture, Graduate School, and Secretarial Science. Shortly thereafter, additional courses were offered such as Secondary Education, Law, Home Economics, Nursing, and Commerce, with major in Accounting, Management, Banking and Finance, and Economics. =Dagupan Colleges= In 1950, the school assumed the name Dagupan Colleges, and the Graduate School added courses leading to the degrees of Master of Arts in Philosophy and Master of Science in Business Administration. The school started a review class in Nursing in 1954. Eventually, review classes in Accounting, Civil Engineering and Law were offered. The year 1959 saw further expansion of curricular offerings with the opening of courses leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition, and Bachelor of Science in Journalism. In the next decade following were added: the organization of Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NROTC) and the Naval Women's Auxiliary Corps in 1960, and the offering of the Sanitary Engineering course in 1965. =Status= On July 3, 1968, the college was converted into a university by virtue of the University Charter granted by the Department of Education. Thereforth, the school operated as the University of Pangasinan. In 2009, it became a member of the PHINMA Education Network.

Background These elections were all indirectly decided in the electoral college, and not reflective of popular vote (whose turnout averaged 10% of male suffrage). The cosmetic nature of this electoral system, which became known locally as the voto cantado (the \\"vote song,\\" for its predetermined script), resulted from a period of intermittent civil wars between those who favored a united Argentina with a strong central government (Unitarians) and Buenos Aires Province leaders who favored an independent nation of their own (Federalists). These conflicts had dominated local political life since 1820, and did not immediately subside with the enactment of the Argentine Constitution of 1853. The military guarantor of the Argentine Confederation, General Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, lost control over his appointed successor, Santiago Derqui, and this led Buenos Aires Governor Bartolom√© Mitre to take up arms in defense of autonomy against what he saw as Derqui's reneging on their 1860 gentlemen's agreement. Victorious at the 1861 Battle of Pav√≥n, Mitre obtained important concessions from the national army - notably the amendment of the Constitution to provide for indirect elections through an electoral college comprised - by design - somewhat disproportionately of electors from the nation's hinterland provinces.Historical Dictionary of Argentina. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. 1862 A skilled negotiator, Mitre placated restive sentiment in Buenos Aires and Entre R√≠os Provinces (where separatist sentiment was highest), and nominated Marcos Paz, a Federalist and former Mitre foe, as his running mate. Arranging an electoral college election on September 4, 1862, he and Paz received the body's unanimous support.Todo Argentina: 1862 1868 Only a conditional supporter of national unity himself, Bartolom√© Mitre instituted the fraudulent \\"vote song\\" as a means of preventing the election of secessionists to high office. Presiding over a prosperous economy overshadowed somewhat by the costly Paraguayan War, President Mitre was at pains to avoid risking the tenuous national unity his administration had secured. Though he hand-picked prospective candidates, Mitre avoided the appearance of direct support for any one figure, while limiting the field to those he considered acceptable. Electors from Buenos Aires Province favored Autonomist Party candidate Adolfo Alsina, who was instead persuaded by Mitre to run for the vice-presidency. The nomination was handed to the Ambassador to the United States, Domingo Sarmiento, who remained at his post and did not campaign. Mitre also supported former Unitarian Party leader Rufino de Elizalde and his running mate General Wenceslao Paunero, a key figure in Mitre's victory at the Battle of Pav√≥n. These candidates were all preferred by the president over that year's dark horse, former President Justo Jos√© de Urquiza (whom Mitre attempted to dissuade from running for fear of the separatist conflict his presence might provoke).Levene, Ricardo. A History of Argentina. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1937. These candidates were, with the exception of Sarmiento, contentious in many circles and provided the new system its first real test. The electoral college met on April 12, 1868, and selected Sarmiento by 79 out of 131 votes, making this the only closely contested race during this era.Todo Argentina: 1868 1874 President Sarmiento's pragmatic approach to Buenos Aires demands and his successful control of separatist revolts in the north paved the way to high office for his vice president, Autonomist Party leader Adolfo Alsina. Alsina gained the support of a sizable facion of Mitre's Nationalist Party, resulting in the formation of the paramount political group in Argentina for the next 42 years: The National Autonomist Party (PAN). Mitre himself did not support Alsina, however, whom he viewed as a veiled Buenos Aires separatist. The elder statesman ran for the presidency again, though the seasoned Alsina outmaneuvered him by fielding Nicol√°s Avellaneda, a moderate lawyer from remote Tucum√°n Province. The electoral college met on April 12, 1874, and awarded Mitre only three provinces, including Buenos Aires. As he had repeatedly up to 1861, Mitre took up arms again. Hoping to prevent Avellaneda's October 12 inaugural, he mutineered a gunboat; he was defeated, however, and only President Avellaneda's commutation spared his life.Todo Argentina: 1874 1880 Inheriting the system of hand-picking successors from Mitre, Julio Roca found it useful to extending his rule by proxy. A leader of the Conquest of the Desert, as well as of the suppression of Mitre's 1874 uprising and others, President Avellaneda had decided on General Julio Roca as his successor, early on. Memories of Mitre's defeat did not sit well with Buenos Aires separatists, and this faction nominated the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Carlos Tejedor. Roca's April 11, 1880, selection by the electoral college was followed by Tejedor's armed insurrection, and though the latter was defeated, Mitre brokered negotiations between Tejedor's separatists and the national government. These negotiations eventually result in the Federalization of Buenos Aires in September, stabilizing the powerful province's position within Argentina.Todo Argentina: 1880 1886 Confident of his authority following six years of peace and prosperity, President Roca was by then known for his shrewdness as \\"the fox.\\" Enjoying the support of the agricultural elites - as well as of the London financial powerhouse, Barings Bank - Roca daringly fielded his brother-in-law, C√≥rdoba Province Governor Miguel Ju√°rez Celman, as the PAN candidate for president. A number of distinguished candidates appeared, including Buenos Aires Governor Dardo Rocha and Foreign Minister Bernardo de Irigoyen. Roca tolerated no opposition against his dauphin, however, who was selected nearly unanimously on April 3, 1886.Todo Argentina: 1886 1892 An 1888 massacre of a May Day gathering and an unprecedented financial crisis led to the formation of the first meaningful opposition to develop as reform movements in urban areas, culminating in the Revolution of the Park that forced Ju√°rez Celman's 1890 resignation. These developments gathered speed when the Civic Youth Union became the Radical Civic Union (UCR), in 1891. Instability also prompted moderates from within the PAN to advance a diplomat, Roque S√°enz Pe√±a, as the nominee. Roca foiled this move by persuading former Supreme Court Chief Justice Luis S√°enz Pe√±a (Roque's father) to run - forcing the young reformist to withdraw. The UCR's appeal, for its part, helped lead President Carlos Pellegrini (who replaced the besieged Ju√°rez Celman) to declare a state of siege a week before the April 10, 1892, elections. The resulting UCR electoral boycott left the ruling PAN as the only party on the ballot, handing its nominee the presidency unanimously.Todo Argentina: 1892 1898 UCR in a 1901 demonstration. Their persevering activism for free and fair elections helped result in the landmark S√°enz Pe√±a Law of 1912. Having obtained the aging Luis S√°enz Pe√±a's resignation in favor of Vice President Jos√© Evaristo Uriburu (who was good stead with both Roca and Mitre), Roca once again carried the PAN standard in 1898. The UCR, which had lost its founder, Leandro Alem, to suicide in 1896, was divided between those who backed Senator Bernardo de Irigoyen's drive to form coalitions with more conservative parties, and those who supported the party's new leader, Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen (who boycotted this and future \\"election songs\\" - establishing what later became known as the UCR's \\"break before bending\\" policy). Public debate was heated on the eve of the January 30 elections to a constitutional assembly entrusted to increase the number of congressmen and cabinet members, as well before the April 10, 1898, general election. The electoral college yielded no surprises, though, and Roca was returned to the presidency.Todo Argentina: 1898 1904 Riding high after another term of prosperity and important diplomatic accomplishments such as the May 1902 Pact with neighboring Chile over a border dispute and Foreign Minister Luis Drago's settlement of imminent war between the German Empire and Venezuela, President Roca enlisted Congressman Manuel Quintana as the PAN standard bearer. Within the PAN itself, some dissent was evident over Roca's dominance. These voices rallied behind former Presidents Carlos Pellegrini (as an Autonomist) and Jos√© Evaristo Uriburu (as a Republican). The UCR maintained its boycott, and the aging Quintana was selected by the electoral college on April 10, 1904. The year's legislative elections were more historically significant than the headline presidential selection: the Buenos Aires district of La Boca elected Alfredo Palacios, the first Socialist Congressman in the western hemisphere.Todo Argentina: 1904 1910 The ailing President Quintana's death in 1906 was the beginning of the end of Roca's dominance of national politics and policy. Moderate opposition to the PAN had greatly eroded its majorities in Congress, the very day the president died, and within months, Bartolom√© Mitre and Carlos Pellegrini were dead, as well. President Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta defied Roca by signing many of Congressman Palacios' labor law reform bills and by 1909, Figueroa Alcorta was poised to nominate the reformist who had been turned away in 1892: Roque S√°enz Pe√±a.Todo Argentina: 1910 Other prominent conservatives, such as La Naci√≥n publisher Emilio Mitre and Buenos Aires Governor Marcelino Ugarte, presented token candidacies. S√°enz Pe√±a, who was the Ambassador to Italy and did not campaign, was selected unanimously on April 12, 1910. He promptly began negotiations with UCR leader Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen for the introduction of legislation providing for universal male suffrage and the secret ballot. The president struggled over the bill with a still-conservative Congress, and on February 10, 1912, the Senate narrowly passed Law 8871. Providing for free and fair elections, as well as for the country's first uniform system of voter registration, the S√°enz Pe√±a Law brought the prolonged \\"vote song\\" to an end.Todo Argentina: 1912  See also  * Politics of Argentina * List of political parties in Argentina References 1862-1910 Argentina Argentina Argentina Argentina Argentina Argentina Argentina Argentina Argentina ","title":"1862‚Äì1910 Argentine presidential elections"},{"id":"22868720","text":"Sturgis Municipal Airport may refer to: * Sturgis Municipal Airport (Kentucky) in Sturgis, Kentucky, United States (FAA: TWT) * Sturgis Municipal Airport (South Dakota) in Sturgis, South Dakota, United States (FAA: 49B) ","title":"Sturgis Municipal Airport"},{"id":"22868778","text":"Cavern of The Fear is the first book in the Deltora Quest 2 series (Deltora Shadowlands in North America) written by Emily Rodda.

The report was authored by Viscountess Ruth Runciman. Recommendations It called for the classification system to be more closely based on the scientific evidence of relative harm and consequently that cannabis should be reclassified from Class B to Class C. This was on the grounds that making cannabis possession a non-arrestable offence would reduce the number of \\"otherwise law-abiding, mainly young people\\" being criminalised and potentially receiving a custodial sentence to the detriment of their futures (p 7). It was also perceived that this could remove a source of friction between the police and the wider community and that this would free up police time (Monaghan 2008: 213). It also argued for the reclassification of LSD and MDMA from Class A to Class B and a reduction in the maximum sentence for possession of Class As, from seven years to twelve months. Lady Runciman's report also recommended the creation of a new offence of drug dealing.

As an orchestra was once again employed (led by Gavyn Wright), the lush arrangements characteristic of Kaleidoscope World resurfaced. The album features the track \\"Now You're Not Here\\" which was used as the theme to the Japanese programme Mahiru No Tsuki, as well as a reworked version of \\"Better Make It Better\\" which had featured on their previous studio album, The Living Return. This album would also mark the beginning of the group's collaborations with Japanese musicians in their studio sessions.

Life  Anton von Prokesch was a man of great versatility, whose multi-faceted career as a soldier, then as a diplomat and statesman, was one of the most remarkable of Austria in the nineteenth century. He participated in the war against France in 1813-1814 and in 1815 as an officer for an order of the Archduke Charles, and then taught mathematics in a military school, before becoming, in 1818 to 1820, secretary of Marshal Karl Philipp von Schwarzenberg. He then joined the diplomatic corps at the invitation of Prince Clemens von Metternich. From 1824 he was sent on mission to the Middle East to observe various conflicts starting with the Greek War of Independence. This appointment was a turning point in his career. He became an authority on the languages and cultures of the Middle East. In addition, numerous scholarly publications made him one of the most respected orientalist in Europe. At the same time, his political reporting won him support of the Metternich. As a Chief of Staff of the Navy since 1827 he signed convention for Christians in the Holy Land with the Pasha of Akka in 1829. In recognition of his services he was conferred the title of Knight von Osten (Knight of the Orient) in 1830. The same year he met at a dinner, the Duke of Reichstadt, son of Napoleon I, who had read his work on Battle of Waterloo, and was enthusiastic about him, he remained a friend until his death. Anton von Prokesch went to Bologna in 1831 as Chief of Staff of the Austrian army. In 1833, he contributed to the signing of a peace between the Viceroy Muhammad Ali, pasha of Egypt, and Sultan Ottoman Mahmud II in Cairo. He was ambassador to Athens from 1834 to 1849. Anton von Prokesch-Osten In 1849, Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg named Anton von Prokesch ambassador in Berlin (1849‚Äì1852), with the mission to restore the influence of Austria in Germany, weakened after the revolutions of 1848. On the way to Berlin, he believed it was possible to restore the understanding that prevailed between the Austria and Prussia and allowed both states to dominate the German Confederation after 1815. However, he quickly realized that King Frederick William IV and his favorite minister, Joseph von Radowitz, considering the creation of a German Empire for the benefit of Prussia. Prokesch was ready to facilitate a limited expansion Prussia in northern Germany, but he understood that he could not reconcile the Prussian ambitions with the interests of Austria and other states of Germany. Isolated, often leaving Vienna without instructions, he turned to Metternich. Faced with the indifference of Schwarzenberg, who was preoccupied with other issues, Prokesch and his Austrian colleagues had established an informal network to exchange information and coordinate their actions. Since his exile in Brussels, where he remained since the revolution of 1848, Metternich had readily agreed to advise his former subordinates, he could influence the development of an Austrian influence on German Affairs. The full restoration of the Confederate regime must be credited much to Prokesch efforts, but his vigorous defense of the traditional role of Austria in Germany made him unpopular in Berlin. In 1853, he was recalled and sent to Frankfurt, as the representative of Austria at the Federal Diet. Appointed to chair this meeting, he had two years to bear the intrigues and tactics of obstruction of his Prussian colleague Otto von Bismarck. During the Crimean War, he unsuccessfully proposed the mobilization of the army against the Russian, as Bismarck knew how to prevent it. It was there that in 1854, he befriended Joseph Arthur de Gobineau. In 1855 he was appointed ambassador to the Sublime Porte, where he remained for sixteen years. At his departure in 1871, Emperor Francis Joseph I granted him the hereditary title of Count in recognition of sixty years of distinguished service. He was a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin and Vienna and had a large collection of coins which was purchased in 1875 by the museum in Berlin.

He is a member of the Republican Party. Early life Hice is a native of Atlanta and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky, a Master of Divinity degree from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and a Doctor of Ministry degree from Luther Rice Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia. Hice first served as senior pastor of Bethlehem First Baptist Church, until April 2010 in Bethlehem, Georgia. In addition, he served as first vice president of the Georgia Baptist Convention (2004‚Äì05) and Professor of Preaching at Luther Rice Seminary. Hice served as senior pastor at The Summit Church, a Southern Baptist church, in Loganville, Georgia from 2011 until December 2013, when he stepped down to run for office. The Jody Hice Show During the battle between the ACLU and Barrow County, Georgia, regarding the public display of the Ten Commandments in the County Courthouse, Hice was asked by a local radio station to provide weekly updates and to address various other issues. From that weekly program a daily show, Let Freedom Ring, which was originally heard on WIMO 1300 AM, Bethlehem, Georgia was created. The show is heard on about 400 stations, the show focuses on Constitutional, moral, and religious liberty issues. U.S. House of Representatives 114th Congress) =2010 election= Hice unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in Georgia's 7th congressional district in 2010. =2014 election= The congressional seat for Georgia's 10th congressional district opened up when the sitting representative, Paul Broun, announced his bid for U.S. Senate in 2014. Hice was the second to formally enter the race on April 15, 2013, citing government spending as his foremost concern. Hice was soon joined by 5 other candidates, leading to primary election of 7 for the open seat. Hice placed first in the primary on May 20, 2014 with 34% of the vote, followed closely by his run-off opponent Mike Collins who won 33% of the vote. With no candidate winning 50% of the vote, a run-off campaign was issued between the top two candidates, Hice and Mike Collins. The close race quickly grew heated amid accusations of campaign sign theft from both sides and reports of supporters being harassed at debates. Hice ultimately won the run-off, grabbing 54% of the vote. Hice faced a Democratic opponent in November election, which he won (66.52%-33.48%) in a GOP wave on November 4, 2014. =2018 midterm election= After winning the Republican primary with 78% of the vote, Hice faced off in the 2018 general election against Democratic challenger, Tabitha A. Johnson-Green. During an October 2018 campaign event in which he appeared with Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, Hice decried former President Obama as having \\"pushed his own socialist agenda\\" during his two terms in office. Hice urged the small crowd gathered to oppose the resurgence of Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, declaring \\"it's time for this so-called blue wave to be body slammed!\\" Hice defeated Johnson-Green in the general election. =Committee assignments= *Committee on Natural Resources **Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources **Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans *Committee on Oversight and Government Reform **Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations **Subcommittee on National Security =Caucus memberships= * Freedom Caucus * Congressional Western Caucus *Veterinary Medicine Caucus * Republican Study Committee  Political positions  Economic issues = Hice supports a balanced budget amendment. Hice supports auditing the federal reserve and its activities around mortgages. He co-sponsored the Federal Reserve Transparency Act. Hice favors tax reform and voted in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He claims the new legislation creates a \\"competitive and fair tax system.\\" He says it will create an improved economy, more opportunities, and \\"keep more money in the pockets of hardworking families and individuals.\\" He also believes \\"It will also encourage American businesses to keep their jobs and revenue here, and our job creators will once again be competitive internationally.\\" =Abortion= Hice is pro-life. He opposes abortions being used for race or sex selection. He believes that life begins at fertilization or cloning. He opposes family planning assistance that includes abortion. =Interest group ratings= Hice has a \\"D\\" rating from marijuana legalization advocacy organization NORML for his voting history regarding cannabis-related issues. =LGBT issues= Hice opposes gay marriage.Jody Hice is likely headed to Congress, Sean Sullivan, July 23, 2014, Washington Post According to Right Wing Watch, Hice compared homosexuality to alcoholism and opposed a ban on gay conversion therapy. =Religious issues= In September 2008, Hice was one of 33 pastors across America who participated in \\"Pulpit Freedom Sunday\\", an effort that challenged an Internal Revenue Service code threatening churches and pastors with loss of tax-exempt status and criminal behavior if they address political issues from the pulpit. In that sermon, Hice endorsed Senator John McCain for President. The IRS never publicly responded to the event, and Pulpit Freedom Sunday has since grown to include over 450 churches. Hice has argued that Christians have been \\"tricked\\" into a \\"false belief\\" in separation of church and state. National media outlets have drawn attention to Hice's views on Islam regarding his book, A Call to Reclaim America, in which he claims that Islam is not only a religion, but a geo-political structure and is therefore not deserving of First Amendment protection. Hice, in his book It's Now or Never, also quoted former U.S. general Jerry Boykin as stating that there is a Muslim Brotherhood plot to take over the United States.Hice, Jody. It's Now or Never, pg. 155 =Women's rights= In a 2004 interview with the Athens Banner-Herald, the largest newspaper in Hice's district, Hice stated that a woman had to be \\"within the authority of her husband\\" if she wanted to run for public office.

The book was published in 2005 by Warner Books, the same year as the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards. The book includes an introduction by Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers, a brief history of the Golden Raspberry Awards, and entries on films organized thematically which include plot summaries and reviews by Wilson. Wilson comments on and discusses his picks for the worst films of all time. The Official Razzie Movie Guide received a positive review in Library Journal, where it was compared to Golden Turkey Awards and The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. The book also received positive reception in Wilmington Star-News the Associated Press and the Long Beach Press-Telegram, but a more critical review in The Evening Standard. Contents The introduction is by Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers, a voting member of the Golden Raspberry Awards Foundation. The book begins with selected quotes from the reviewers of such films as The Blue Lagoon, From Justin to Kelly, and Color of Night. The book also includes a brief history of the Golden Raspberry Awards. Wilson lists and discusses his picks of the 100 worst films of Hollywood. The chapters all deal with bad movies, and are organized thematically with titles such as \\"Disasters ... In Every Sense.\\" and \\"Can't Stop the Musicals\\". Each movie entry includes credits of the cast and crew, excerpts of dialogue from the movie, and a plot summary and review by Wilson. Wilson's picks of the ten worst films include The Adventurers (1970), Battlefield Earth (2000), Body of Evidence (1993), Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), Glen or Glenda (1953), The Lonely Lady (1983), Mommie Dearest (1981), The Oscar (1966), Showgirls (1995) and Xanadu (1980). Marketing Pat Nason of United Press International (UPI) wrote that marketing of the book \\"may have been somewhat complicated by the cover art\\", which shows an actor in a gorilla costume with his middle finger raised, taken from the 1976 film A*P*E. Wilson had originally wanted the gorilla picture to appear on the back cover of the book; however, Warner Books stated it must appear on the book's front cover. \\"It might stand as an apt emblem of the Razzies themselves,\\" commented Nason. \\"We are not PC. We do not pull punches. We do not pay attention to the basic rules of decorum. Hopefully the humor with which it is packaged takes a little of the sting out of it\\", said Wilson to UPI. Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade described the book as \\"a merchandising tie-in\\" to the Golden Raspberry Awards. Wilson announced the nominees for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards at a book signing for The Official Razzie Movie Guide at Brentano's in Century City, Los Angeles, California. Reception The Official Razzie Movie Guide received generally positive reviews from critics. Barry X. Miller reviewed the book for Library Journal, and wrote \\"Wilson's text is a surfeit of saccharine Goobers and gooey Ju Ju Bees, empty calories but fun to eat.\\" Miller compared to the book to Golden Turkey Awards and The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. Miller commented that Wilson provides \\"a wonderfully droll review\\" for each film entry in the book. Ben Steelman of the Wilmington Star-News called the book a \\"handy volume\\", and commented \\"in loving detail, Mr. Wilson describes his 100 favorites among the Worst Movies Ever Made\\", David Germain of the Associated Press wrote that Wilson discusses \\"his take on the 100 most awful‚Äîyet perversely fun‚Äîmovies to watch\\". Jenny Marder of the Long Beach Press-Telegram noted \\"Wilson, creator of the Golden Raspberry Awards, or Razzies, has become the authority for all movies so dreadful, they're laughable, so excruciating, they're, well, award-winning.\\" Catherine Shoard of The Evening Standard took a less enthusiastic approach to the book, describing it as \\"a companion book to the annual Golden Raspberry awards\\", and saying that \\"it's a shame elderly duds get more space than recent winners, and Wilson's style, though amusing, is never really more than descriptive.

She was professor emerita of astronomy at Swarthmore College and director emerita of the college's Sproul Observatory. She was a pioneer in the use of astrometry to determine the character of binary stars and search for extrasolar planets. Education Lippincott received a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1941 and an M.A. from Swarthmore College in 1942. Life Lippincott was born in 1920 and attended college at the University of Pennsylvania College for Women in the 1940s, where she played on the women's basketball team. After graduation from the University of Pennsylvania, Lippincott attended Swarthmore College, where she worked closely with Peter van de Kamp on many astrometry projects between 1945 and his retirement in 1972. She wrote his obituary when he died in 1995. She became observatory director after Peter van de Kamp retired in 1972. She was the third wife of the late Dave Garroway, the founding host of NBC's Today show. Garroway had an active interest in astronomy, and they met on a tour of observatories in the Soviet Union that she was hosting. After Garroway's death by suicide at their home in 1982, she helped establish the Dave Garroway Laboratory for the Study of Depression at the University of Pennsylvania. She conducted numerous astrometric studies of nearby stars with van de Kamp in the search for extrasolar planets. She reported the discovery of several objects of sub-stellar mass and proposed a 0.01 solar-mass planetary companion to the star Lalande 21185 in 1951. The same proposal of planetary objects was made for a number of other stars as well. Claims for the smaller planetary objects were never confirmed and gradually have become discredited. However, she was quite successful in using the same techniques for characterizing many binary star systems. Her 1951 calculations of the orbit of the difficult astronomical binary star system Ross 614 were used to successfully find and image the system's secondary star. These calculations were used by Walter Baade to find and optically resolve this binary system for the first time using the then new Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California. She is listed as professor emerita of astronomy and director emerita of the Sproul Observatory in the 2010 Swarthmore college catalog. She last published astronomy research papers in 1983. In 2009 she attended the dedication ceremony for the new Peter van de Kamp observatory at Swarthmore College. Lippincott died on February 28, 2019 in Kendal Longwood. Honors and awards In 1966 she received the Kappa Kappa Gamma Alumnae Achievement Award.Kappa Kappa Gamma Alumnae Achievement Award Recipients, 1966, Sarah Lee Lippincott In 1973 she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science by Villanova University.

Pennsylvania  William Baldwin was born in Newlin Township, Pennsylvania,William Baldwin Personal Papers At: Website of the LuEsther T. Mertz Library At: Website of New York Botanical Garden. (see External links below). a small township about one kilometer southeast of Embreeville in Chester County. He was the son of Elizabeth Baldwin (nee Garretson) and Thomas Baldwin, a Quaker minister. He suffered from poor health all of his life because of chronic tuberculosis, and like the rest of his family, he would die of it. At the time, his condition was called hereditary tuberculosis, but it is now known that tuberculosis is an infectious disease.William Baldwin Personal Papers At: Gray Herbarium Archives At: Harvard University Herbarium. (see External links below). William Baldwin had little formal education, but he had a thirst for knowledge and became a school teacher at a young age. When he was not teaching class, he was in Downingtown, Chester County, studying medicine under Dr. William A. Todd. It was here that he met Moses Marshall, the nephew of botanist Humphry Marshall. He sometimes went with Moses Marshall to Marshallton in Chester County to study the botanic garden that his uncle had established there. Thus began the young Baldwin's lifelong enthusiasm for botany In 1802, he took one course in medicine at the University of Tennessee, but soon ran out of money, and returned to his studies under Dr. Todd. It was near the end of 1802 when he began his medical studies at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. One of his teachers, Benjamin Smith Barton, encouraged his study of botany and taught him much on the subject. Barton occasionally took Baldwin and other students on botanical excursions into the countryside. In particular Barton's classes studied at the botanic collections at Bartram's Garden under William Bartram and at William Hamilton's garden The Woodlands in Philadelphia. While Baldwin was attending the university, one of his friends and fellow students, William Darlington developed a serious illness. Baldwin devoted much time and effort to assisting his recovery. Thus began a close and lifelong friendship. After one course at the University of Pennsylvania, Baldwin again fell short financially, and in 1803 returned to Dr. Todd to work as his assistant. In 1805, he secured a position as a surgeon on a ship, and sailed to Antwerp, then to Guangzhou, and returned to Philadelphia in 1806. During this voyage, he earned enough money to complete his studies. He returned to the University of Pennsylvania and was awarded the degree of M.D. in April 1807.  Delaware  Before the end of 1807, he had moved to Wilmington, Delaware and married Hannah Webster, a young lady who had far more education than most women of her time. They would eventually have four daughters.Page 324 In: William Darlington. 1843. Reliquiae Baldwinianae Kimber and Sharpless: Philadelphia, PA, USA. facsimile edition with introduction by Joseph Ewan. 1969. Hafner Publishing Company: New York, NY, USA; London, England. William Baldwin and his wife considered themselves to be devout Quakers, but they were thrown out of meeting for getting married by a Presbyterian minister whom the Quakers called a mere \\"hireling\\". Baldwin apologized for this and was reinstated. During his time in Wilmington, he lived by the practice of medicine and spent his leisure hours in botany. In January 1811, he received a letter from Henry Muhlenberg which began as follows: Thus began an enduring friendship and a correspondence that eventually consisted of 90 letters, continuing to the death of Dr. Muhlenberg in 1815.  Georgia  In Wilmington, Baldwin's health continued to deteriorate, and in the autumn of 1811, he moved to Georgia to avoid the severity of the northern winters. In January 1812, he visited Stephen Elliott at his plantation in South Carolina. Baldwin sent Elliott many specimens in the following years, and also some descriptions, which Elliott included in his book A Sketch of the Botany of South Carolina and Georgia, giving Baldwin full credit for having written them. The War of 1812 began on June 18 of that year with the declaration of war by the U.S. Congress, and soon thereafter, Baldwin joined the navy as a surgeon. For this, he was thrown out of meeting for the second time by the Quakers. He protested that he had gone to war \\"not to make wounds, but to heal them\\", but his membership was never restored in spite of his determined efforts to regain it. Baldwin's military service lasted nearly 4¬Ω years, from the summer of 1812 to the autumn of 1816. He spent the first 2¬Ω years of his service at St. Marys, Georgia, a small settlement at the mouth of the St. Marys River. The next two years were spent in Savannah. While he lived in Georgia, he sometimes took long journeys on foot, traveling deep into territory occupied by the Creek Indians. He was well received by the natives, and he, in turn, was deeply sympathetic toward them. In his biographical sketch of Baldwin, Darlington writes: When Baldwin left the navy near the end of 1816, he sent his family back to Wilmington. In the winter of 1816 to 1817 through the spring of 1817, he continued to live in Georgia, making frequent botanical excursions there and in what would soon become the state of Florida. At that time, many Americans called it East Florida. He returned to Wilmington in 1817 in spite of concerns about his health. In August of that year, while passing through Philadelphia, he met Zaccheus Collins and they became fast friends. In 1817, President James Monroe selected Caesar Augustus Rodney, John Graham, and Theodorick Bland, as commissioners for a special diplomatic mission to South America, the South American Commission of 1817-1818. Because of his reputation as a botanist, Baldwin was selected to sail on the frigate USS Congress as a botanical investigator as well as the ship's surgeon. He embarked late in 1817 and returned to Wilmington in July 1818. During its voyage, Congress stopped at the ports of Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Maldonado, San Salvador, Brazil, and Margarita Island, Venezuela. During these stops, Baldwin found plenty of opportunity to collect plants that he would press and dry for later study. After Baldwin returned to Wilmington in July 1818, he planned to study the large collection of plants that he had accumulated, and he began to prepare manuscripts for publication. He exchanged letters with Zaccheus Collins and William Darlington on Cyperus, Scirpus, and Rhynchospora, members of the family Cyperaceae that he was preparing a treatment of. He wrote to Darlington that \\"It will not do to hurry - there has been too much hurrying among our botanists.\\" But his plans were not to be fulfilled. The U.S. government was preparing an expedition, to be led by Major Stephen Long, to explore the upper reaches of the Missouri River. William Darlington and John Eatton Le Conte recommended Baldwin as the botanist for this mission and urged him to go.  Missouri  William Baldwin dropped his work on the grasses Panicum and Paspalum to accept the appointment as botanist on Major Long's expedition. In March 1819, he traveled to Pittsburgh to join other members of the expedition. There were delays in Pittsburgh, and departure did not occur until May 5. Baldwin believed that travel would sustain his health, but might have had premonitions of his fate. Soon after he started down the Ohio River, He wrote to Darlington: In another letter to Darlington, he described the condition of the boat. A stop was made in Cincinnati for a whole week, partly for repairs, and partly because of the alarming condition of Dr. Baldwin. The expedition reached Franklin, Missouri, a small town across the river from Boonville in mid-July where Baldwin resigned from the expedition to convalesce in the home of John J. Lowry. The following October, William Darlington received a letter from John J. Lowry, which began as follows: William Baldwin was among the first of about 100 members of Major Long's expedition to die of disease and deprivation. When word of this reached the U.S. Congress, they immediately declared the expedition a failure and terminated its funding.James L. Reveal. 1992. Gentle Conquest: page 112. Starwood Publishing, Inc. Washington, DC. Thus ended the ill-fated venture which claimed the life of one of America's greatest botanists. Baldwin was 40 years and 5 months of age at the time of his death. He was buried on the banks of the Missouri River. At the end of his biographical sketch of Baldwin, Darlington, in 1843, wrote: In January 1844, Lowry wrote to Darlington to tell him that the grave of his friend had been washed away by the floodwaters of the Missouri.  Papers  Many of Baldwin's personal papers have been preserved. Some of these are in the Mertz Library at the New York Botanical Garden. Others are in the Asa Gray Archive at the Harvard University Herbarium. Baldwin's first scientific paper was on two new species of Rottboellia that he had found on the coast of Georgia.William Baldwin. 1819. \\"Account of Two North American Species of Rottboellia Discovered on the Seacoast of Georgia\\". American Journal of Science and Arts 1:355-359. It was published in the year of his death. His only other paper was read before a meeting of the American Philosophical Society on April 16, 1819 as he made his way down the Ohio River, but it was not published until 1825. Its subject was two species of Cyperus from Georgia and four Species of Kyllinga from South America.William Baldwin. 1825. \\"Account of Two North American Species of Cyperus, from Georgia, and of four species of Kyllinga, from the Brazilian Coast and from the Rio de la Plata\\". Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, new series, 2:167-171.  Collections  One of the concerns of botany in the early 21st century is the location of type specimens, the material that formed the basis of the description that was given when the plant was named. The whereabouts of this material is sometimes discovered unexpectedly. For example, a set of 18 specimens that Baldwin gave to the American Philosophical Society in March 1819 was neglected, probably because of its small size, and was not studied until 1978. At that time, it was found to contain the type specimens of some species of Rhynchospora.Ronald L. Stuckey. 1978. \\"Type specimens of Rhynchospora (Cyperaceae) in an unstudied collection of William Baldwin\\". Brittonia 30(1):96-101. (see External links below) William Baldwin donated generously to the collections of others, often exchanging some of his plants for plants that he desired. He contributed much to the herbaria if Muhlenberg, Elliott, Collins, and Darlington. He also sent specimens to Aylmer Bourke Lambert and Aime Bonpland,Joseph A. Ewan. 1969. \\"Introduction by Joseph Ewan\\" In: Facsimile edition of: William Darlington. 1843. Reliquiae Baldwinianae. Hafner Publishing Company: New York, NY, USA; London, England. 1969. and in 1817, he sent some to James Edward Smith. Smith published several new species based on material that Baldwin had sent him.John Edmondson. 2004. \\"Dr. William Baldwin and his plant collections from Georgia in the Smithian Herbarium at the Linnean Society of London\\". Vulpia 3:80-98. In 1811, he sent moss and lichen specimens to Olof Swartz and Erik Acharius. In 1815, he sent more of the same to Christian Friedrich Schw√§grichen. Upon Baldwin's death, his widow wanted to give his herbarium to William Darlington, but Darlington would not accept it because he thought that she should sell it, and he was unable to pay her what it was worth. Zaccheus Collins bought Baldwin's herbarium, but made no scientific use of it. Collins was a Philadelphia merchant who knew as much botany as anyone, but to the exasperation of botanists of his time, chose to create one of the best herbaria in the United States, but published nothing. Collins died without a will in 1831. He had kept the Baldwin herbarium separate from the rest of his collection. The executor of his estate, his son-in-law, sold the Baldwin herbarium to Lewis von Schweinitz for $105 in 1833. Schweinitz already had a herbarium holding 20,000 species, and the addition of the Baldwin herbarium gave Schwienitz 3000 species that he did not already have. At this time, he wrote to John Torrey, offering him duplicates from the Baldwin herbarium of plants that he already had. Schweinitz died in 1834, before he could fully mine the riches of the Baldwin herbarium. John Torrey used letters that he had received from Schweinitz to obtain from Schweinitz's widow a part of the Baldwin herbarium which he shared with Asa Gray. The rest of the Baldwin herbarium then went to its present location at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The plants that Baldwin had given to Collins' main collection were given with that collection to Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in the spring of 1837 in payment of a debt owed to Rafinesque by the Collins estate. Rafinesque died in 1840 and his herbarium was acquired the following year by Elias Durand, the curator of the herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Durand, a citizen of France, discarded much of the Rafinesque herbarium and sent the remainder to Paris where it remains today as the Herbier Durand in the Herbier National de Paris at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle. Those plants that Baldwin gave to Darlington are now in the Darlington Herbarium at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. Those that he gave to James Edward Smith are in the Smithian Herbarium at Kew Gardens, London. Other plants attributed to Baldwin are at the University of Manchester Herbarium and at the herbarium of the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. The historian Ronald L. Stuckey has found that Thomas Nuttall, Stephen Elliott, Asa Gray, John Torrey, and Constantine Rafinesque together published at least 109 new species based on material provided by William Baldwin. Twelve of these descriptions were actually written by Baldwin, and published by Stephen Elliott in Sketch of the Botany of South Carolina and Georgia. Muhlenberg did not record where his specimens came from, but it is known that Baldwin sent him many. James Edward Smith also described new species from material sent by Baldwin.  Honors  As with nearly everyone who has contributed greatly to botany, there were plants named after William Baldwin. Thomas Nuttall named the genus Balduina for him in 1818, deriving the name from a latinization of \\"Baldwin\\". At the bottom of the page where Balduina is described, we find the footnote: John Torrey and Asa Gray changed Balduina to Baldwinia in 1840,John Torrey and Asa Gray. 1840. A Flora of North America: containing abridged descriptions of all the known indigenous and naturalized plants growing north of Mexico;.... Wiley & Putnam: New York, London, Paris. (see External links below). but this orthographical variant was not generally accepted. Balduina is now a conserved name. Balduina is a genus of three species native to the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plain. Not all authors have put them in one genus and they have had various names,Earl S. Parker and Samuel B. Jones. 1975. \\"A Systematic Study of the Genus Balduina\\". Brittonia 27(4):355-361. but a revision of Asteraceae in 2007 placed all three of these species together in Balduina.Jose L. Panero. 2007. \\"Tribe Helenieae\\" In: Klaus Kubitzki (editor). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume VIII: pages 400-405. Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg Germany. Several species of plants have been named for William Baldwin. Among those names that are still in use, we have, including authors, the following names: Eleocharis baldwinii (John Torrey) Alvan Wentworth Chapman, Rhynchospora baldwinii Asa Gray, Saccharum baldwinii Curt Sprengel, Clematis baldwinii John Torrey and Asa Gray, Paronychia baldwinii (Torrey and Gray) Eduard Fenzl and Wilhelm Walpers, Eryngium baldwinii Curt Sprengel, Vernonia baldwinii John Torrey, Xyris baldwiniana Josef Schultes, and Matelea baldwyniana (Robert Sweet) Robert Woodson.Alan S. Weakley. continually updated. \\"Flora of the Carolinas, Virginia, and Georgia\\". online book at: website of The University of North Carolina Herbarium. (see External links below).Flora of North America (see External links below). At least six other plants, including Fimbristylis annua, Dichanthelium ensifolium, Ptelea trifoliata, Silene catesbaei, Symphyotrichum undulatum, and Viguiera (Rhysolepis) anchusifolia have had names that honored Baldwin, but these are no longer in use.

This temple is regarded as the 6th of the Tevara Stalams in the Pandya kingdom of Tamil Nadu. The temples Rameswaram and Tiruvadanai are the other Shivastalams nearby. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. Mythology Shrines in the campus The snakes Vasuki and Kaarkotakan worshipped Lord Shiva there, hence the separate shrine for Tirunageswarar in the outer 3rd prakaram (outer courtyard). Pranavam is said to have realized that Shiva and Pranavam were the same there and is said to have manifested as the Konrai Maram. Goddess Mahalaskhmi once wished to have a darshan of Lord Shiva's dance. Lord Shiva acceded to her request and told her that she can have a vision of his dance at this sthalam. Accordingly, Shiva revealed a vision of his Cosmic Dance known as Gowri Thandavam to Goddess Mahalakshmi there. Agasthyar, Valmiki, Jayanthan the son Devendran are said to have worshipped there. This temple had royal patronage from the early Chola, Pandiya and Chera kings, and by the later period Pallavas, Sethupathy Raja and Maruthu Pandiyar. Architectural Design Shrines in the campus Although Thiruputhur is small, the temple is massive. This temple has a main vimanam with stucco images on the east side and 3 prakarams (outer courtyard). The outer 3rd prakaram (outer courtyard) is a wide courtyard. In the 2nd middle prakaram (outer courtyard) shrines for Lord Subramanya and his consorts Valli and Deivaanai are found. Shiva is called Tiruttalinathar, Sreetalinathar and the Ambal, while his mother Parvathy is called Sivakami, Soundarya Nayaki. The shrine is elevated and faces east. The shrine for Sivagami is situated parallel to the north of the main sanctum and faces east. The mandapam in front of the sanctum has pillars with beautiful sculptured images of Rishabavaaganar, Narthana Ganapathy, Venugpolan and Narasimhar. Metal images of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana are seen there. Stone images of Nataraja and Sivakami are there. The Yoga Bhairavar shrine (facing West) is of significance. Metal images of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana are there. The Navagrahams are in a seated posture. Entering the 3rd inner prakaram (outer courtyard) from the east side, reveals shrines for Sun God Sooriyan, Mahalakshmi, Mahaganapathy, Dakshinamurthy, Varunalingam, Visalakshmi Amman, Agasthiyalingam, Sandeswarar and Durgai on the 4 pathways of the prakaram (outer courtyard). The sthala vriksham is Konrai tree and the Theertham is called Garuda Theertham. The two circular pilasters with circular shafts on four sides of the vimana indicates the antiquity of the temple. The feature is possibly termed Vrittasputitas in silpa texts like Shilparatna. Such a feature is otherwise found only in few other temples like Neyyadiappar Temple, Tillaistanam, central shrine in Moovar Koil in Kodumbalur, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram in Narthamalai, Anantheswara temple in Udayarkudi and Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam.

Encyclopaedia Metallum was described by Matt Sullivan of Nashville Scene as \\"the Internet's central database for all that is 'tr00' in the metal world.\\" Terrorizer described the site as \\"a exhaustive list of pretty much every metal band ever, with full discographies, an active forum and an interlinking members list that shows the ever-incestuous beauty of the metal scene\\".\\"A Decade in Downloading\\", Terrorizer's Secret History of... the Decade, December 2009 Nevertheless, there are exceptions for bands which fall under disputed genres not accepted by the website. Encyclopaedia Metallum attempts to provide comprehensive information on each band, such as a discography, logos, pictures, lyrics, line-ups, biography, trivia and user- submitted reviews. The site also provides a system for submitting bands to the archives. The website is free of advertisements and is run completely independently.  History  The Encyclopaedia Metallum was officially launched on July 17, 2002 by a Canadian couple from Montreal using the pseudonyms HellBlazer and Morrigan. A couple years prior, HellBlazer had the idea of an encyclopedia for heavy metal and attempted to create an HTML page for every metal band by hand. Although he gave up with that initial attempt, a fully automated site with contributions from its users was in the works. The site initially went live early in July 2002 and the first band (Amorphis) was added on July 7. In just over a year the site had amassed a database of over 10,000 bands. The site continues to grow at a rate of about 500 bands per month. On 1 January 2013, the site announced that bands with entirely digital discographies could now be submitted to the Archives, changing the site's decade-long policy of physical releases only. Digital releases must have a fixed track listing, album art, professional or finished production and be available in a high-quality or lossless format through official distribution sources (such as Bandcamp and/or iTunes). On 13 November 2014, the number of bands listed in the database reached 100,000. = April Fools' Day pranks = The site has a tradition of April Fool's Day pranks that are sometimes taken seriously. This started in 2009 with the addition of Korn into the Metal- Archives and several dozen user reviews praising their first self-titled album, with the news article of the day claiming that the first album was metal enough for the site. A series of staged arguments between moderators appeared throughout the day on the site's forum. 2010 was the year they removed \\"The Tavern\\" (the general discussion forum) for a day. In 2012 the site posted an FBI logo on the main page, suggesting that the site was suspended by the FBI as a result from the SOPA and PIPA bill, which was a much-talked about phenomenon in the media around this time. Despite the ability to bypass this image just by clicking on it, many people took the prank seriously and thought that Metal Archives had actually been shut down for promoting internet piracy. Nickelback was added to the Metal-Archives in 2013 in a prank that was similar to the 2009 Korn prank, as it also had user submitted joke reviews praising various Nickelback albums. In 2014, the prank consisted on the addition of several (mostly praising) reviews of an EP called Penis Metal released by Chilean black metal band Hades Archer, followed by the addition of the band's logo and pictures which included penis on them. The band's style was also changed to Penis Metal. A secondary prank involved the spontaneous deletion of controversial band Meshuggah (whose genre was listed on the site as \\"technical nu-metal/djent\\" and later changed to simply \\"djent\\"), leading to another series of arguments between moderators on the site's forum, although not to the extent of the 2009 prank. Meshuggah were reinstated the following day. For the 2015 prank a hoax news story was posted \\"announcing\\" that the site was no longer free to use and the site was introducing paid membership features. A following news post revealed that the previous post was a prank. In 2016, following an argument between moderators and users alike on the question of moderating reviews, an announcement was made that reviews were no longer being accepted and that all existing ones would be deleted. Later the same day another announcement was made that the staff had changed their minds by bringing back the reviews as well as having every future review accepted automatically. This resulted in a wave of joke reviews that were deleted from the site the next day. In 2017, the staff members announced that they would now produce articles commentating on the metal scene, and proceeded to post tabloid and gossip articles on the site. These were taken down the next day. In 2018, the website announced that it was no longer accepting new band submissions, arguing, \\"We currently have over 120,000 bands, more than we ever thought possible. That is more than enough to declare our database 100% complete. Safe to say, no other resource comes close to being as thorough and comprehensive.\\" The \\"last\\" band to be added on the site was Michael Schenker Fest. Later that day, the website revealed that this was an April Fool's prank, and wrote, \\"Band submissions are open again. Here's to another 120,000 bands and more!.\\" In 2019, the website announced it was deleting most pages and would only list bands deemed \\"good\\" by the staff.  Accepted and excluded bands  A map of heavy metal bands per capita based on Encyclopaedia Metallum data. Traditional heavy metal genres and era (such as the NWOBHM) have stringent rulings; users are warned in the rules section to consider bands submitted under these classifications as \\"ambiguous,\\" in the sense that if a band is submitted with these terms as their genre, the music will be extensively reviewed by the moderators before they decide whether or not to accept the band onto the website.\\"Websites \\"rules\\"... heavy metal/hard rock to be considered \\"ambiguous\\"\\" . This is because in the past, some submissions labeled with those genres have turned out not to be metal, according to the site's guidelines. Some bands which are commonly referred to as traditional heavy metal or NWOBHM, such as Def Leppard, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Scorpions and Stryper, are on the website due to only one or two of the bands' albums meeting the website's specifications. Additionally, there are some non- metal bands featured on the site that are considered to be part of the metal scene despite not being metal themselves (usually dark ambient and folk bands, examples being Mortiis, Elend, Nest, Of The Wand & The Moon, Autumn Tears, Stille Volk, etc.). These bands are selected by the moderators \\"in an admittedly arbitrary fashion,\\" and their submission by normal users is discouraged. Their submission was entirely restricted to site staff in September 2015. Certain genres related to metal that the site does not accept are djent and nu metal, although some bands who are on the site have released albums in the latter genre (examples being Machine Head, who released two nu- metal albums while the genre was at its peak in popularity, but have spent most of their career as a groove metal band, and Soulfly, who started out as nu-metal before moving away from that sound, and were accepted on the basis of their later albums). Metalcore and deathcore are only allowed on the site if the moderators consider at least one album \\"clearly more metal than core\\", examples being As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage, After the Burial, Carnifex, All Shall Perish, The Red Chord and Despised Icon are allowed on the site while Bring Me the Horizon, Atreyu, Born of Osiris, Between the Buried and Me and Oceano are not allowed.\\"Rules & Guidelines - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives\\". www.metal-archives.com.

There are two entrances to the temple corresponding to the Shiva and the Ambal shrines. Massive walls surrounding the temple and the picturesque Rajagopuram beautify this shrine.

He is best known in Australia for his tribute to Charles Aznavour, \\"Aznavour... From Today\\" and most likely the only Aznavour tribute of its kind in Australia. He made his stage debut in 1978 working with a French Theatre Company touring Mauritius. During his first theatrical season, Milko played a small part in the world premiere of Mauritian Operetta Surcouf, performed at the Port Louis Municipal Theatre with French tenor Jose Todaro in the title role. Other operettas during that season include The Gipsy Princess, The Count of Luxemburg, The Merry Widow and La Route Fleurie. In that same year, Milko made his debut on Mauritian Television singing the French song J'attendrai, which was made famous by Edith Piaf. During the ensuing years, Milko then a student of Mauritian tenor Max Moutia, regularly appeared in clubs and hotels around the island. In 1979, Milko co‚Äìproduced with Bernard Desvaux de Marigny a stage show on the music of Surcouf, that was later produced for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation ‚Äì MBC, The Mauritian National Television. In 1981, Milko produced and directed his first big production, IL etait une fois L'Operette at the Port Louis Municipal Theatre. The show consisted of a 28 piece orchestra, a chorus of 30, 6 dancers and 6 lead singers including Milko. The show proved very successful with the Mauritian audience with 2 additional performances being added to the initial run. In 1984, Milko was again employed by another Theatre Company touring Mauritius under the direction of French conductor Andre Martial; a former conductor at Le Chatelet in Paris. In the lead to this 1984 season, Milko was the representative for the French investors to the Mauritian authorities, co-ordinating the organisation of the season. Milko performed in the following operettas: La Belle de Cadix, The Merry Widow, Quatre Jours a Paris & Le Chanteur de Mexico. In that same year, Milko sang one of the leads in the French show PATHEPHONIE directed by Gerard Manuel. The show was produced to commemorate the 100 years of the Alliance Francaise in Mauritius. Earlier in the year, Milko sang the tenor role in Mozart's Requiem under the direction of Mauritian Conductor Gerard Lahausse de la Louvi√®re. Upon arriving in Australia, Milko studied with New Zealand Bass Grant Dickson and 2 years later made his debut as Luiz in Parramatta Theatre Company production of The Gondoliers. Other roles with various theatre companies around Sydney include Nathaniel & Franz in The Tales of Hoffmann, Camille de Rosillon in The Merry Widow. In the mid nineties, Milko returned to popular music and started working in the club scene within Sydney's metropolitan region, scoring two Mo Awards nominations in 1996 & 1997\\\\. Milko released his first album entitled To Dream in early 1998, produced by Miles Harris. Milko toured for a few years with the stage show European Connection before producing his own show Hats off To Broadway which quickly became popular within the club circuit. Hats Off To Broadway also starred Rikelle Turner, Sheridan Gaudry and the Hats off show girls under the musical direction of John Watson. In 2002, he starred in a new production Moulin Bergere, a show that brought Milko back to French popular music and in spring 2003, Milko produced and starred in the first Aznavour show in Australia. Aznavour...From Today, directed by Rikelle Turner is still working in Australia today. In 2006, Milko made his international debut in the States performing a cabaret version of Aznavour...From Today at The Manor, the dream venue of all Cabaret performers accompanied by New York-based Musical Director Tex Arnold. Also in 2006, Milko released the first Aznavour album by an Australian recording artist,Milko Foucault ‚Äì Larche Sings Aznavour produced by guitar sensation and producer Clive Lendich. Clive is the only Australian musician of the American group The Manhattan Transfer. Following his International debut and the release of his new album, Milko has emerged in the last few years as one of the leading ambassadors of French popular music in Australia. He has also brought to the stage in 2007 his production, Under Paris Skies, and his one man show, Strictly Continental. In 2008, he returned to the Cabaret scene with his show, Pardon My French and performed at the Rugby World Cup in Canberra performing the French National Anthem before the match between France and Scotland. In 2009, he won the 2009 BEST INTERNATIONAL THEME PERFORMER in Australia with his show AZNAVOUR...FROM TODAY. In summer 2010, Milko opened EUROPEAN CARNEVALE SPECTACULAR at The Juniors, one of Sydney's leading clubs. In March Milko was invited to perform TheCanadian National Anthem for a Canadian Insurance company having their conference in Sydney. In June 2010, Milko was nominated for an Australian \\"MO\\" Award in the BEST INTERNATIONAL PERFORMER category and later that year, Milko made his directorial debuts, producing and directing NOSTALGIE LYRIQUE, a show of French Opera & French Operetta. Nostalgie Lyrique was the first show of its kind to be produced in Australia. Early in 2011, Milko released a new album of French songs recorded in 2010 with various Sydney based Producers. The album \\"If you love me \\" is a selection of songs from Aznavour, Piaf & B√©caud. In April Milko released on YouTube the Jacques Brel classic \\"If We Only Have Love\\" recorded early in the year with stage partners Rikelle Turner & Sheridan Gaudry. Musical arrangement by Les Dempsey and the vocal arrangement by Ingrid Sakurovs. Early July Milko partnered with French chanteuse Amandine Petit for a Jacques Brel tribute at Guillaume on Bennelong at The Sydney Opera House for the Chris O'Brien Foundation Charity lunch. With 2 new shows in 2012; THE FRENCH CROONERS & BY POPULAR DEMAND, Milko now has a catalogue of 8 productions available for booking.\\" Milko Foucault ‚ÄìLarche Linkedin\\" gives a complete list of all productions and their various band combinations. Also in 2012, Milko produced & directed the second edition of Nostalgie Lyrique at Petersham Town Hall in Sydney with a cast of 41 . A sold-out performance to an enthusiastic audience; some of which had travelled from Melbourne to be part of this event described as \\"the French Musical event \\" of the year in Sydney. Milko made his return to Opera with the aria \\"Ah! Mes Amis\\" from Donizetti's \\" La Fille du R√©giment\\" (The Daughter of the Regiment) and also performed the French adaptation of the very famous Barinkay's Aria from Strauss's Gipsy Baron, and excerpts from The Merry Widow, The White Horse Inn, Le Chanteur de Mexico and Surcouf (The first Mauritian Operetta). In July 2013, Milko produced & directed PARIS BY NIGHT, another French show exclusive to The South Sydney Juniors Club in Sydney with two sold-out performances. The shows included leading lady, Rikelle Turner, The Fabulous Popset Dancers and The Sydney Cosmopolitan Quartet under The Musical direction of John Watson. Choreography: Debbie Graham ‚Äì Lloyd. Earlier in that same month of July Milko had produced a new show titled SINCERELY YOURS, a show aimed at our Seniors. 2013 was all about the 10 year anniversary of AZNAVOUR...FROM TODAY, still the first and only Aznavour show in Australia. To mark this milestone, Milko embarked on taking the show to the most prestigious and iconic Art Centre in Australia: The Sydney Opera House with a one night only performance on 30 October. Milko presented a revamped version of AZNAVOUR...FROM TODAY at The Studio ‚Äì Sydney Opera House. This new version of the show was directed by English ‚Äì Australian actor Barry Quin, accompanied by The Sydney Cosmopolitan Orchestra along with Rikelle Turner, Sheridan Gaudry & Steve Brown and under the Musical Direction of John Watson. One of the \\"show ‚Äì stoppers\\" of that performance was Charles Aznavour's Ave Maria; which possibly was a first in Australia and resulted in a standing ovation in the middle of the show. A few weeks later, Milko recorded a studio version of the Aznavour Ave Maria for what he's described as \\"an Ave Maria of modern times\\" and was produced by Marcus Holden in Sydney. In 2014, Milko ventured into pop music and keeping up with the romantic music style that he prefers, he created ENGELBERT...The Way it used to be. The show opening at Revesby Workers Club in Sydney in October. In 2015 & 2016, Milko launched yet another Australian first by teaming up a production of ‚ÄòEngelbert with Tom Jones‚Äô on the same stage.TOM JONES & ENGELBERT TOGETHER AT LAST opened in July 2015 and played some of the major rooms in Sydney. In 2016, a revamped version of Tom Jones & Engelbert welcomed a new Tom Jones performed by Australian Entertainer Jeff Fallon. 2016 was over all a huge year of creations and revamped shows for Milko. Early in the year, a sold out Aznavour show ; a dusted & revamped production at Glen Street Theatre on Sydney's North shore. In June, Milko teamed up with long time friend & musical director John Watson ( Mr Minsky) to create STRICTLY ROMANCE. July saw 2 more creations: CAROUSEL OF SONGS in partnership with Rikelle Brown. A Variety show where Milko & Rikelle bring their favourite styles together and combine their ability to venture in various genre. From Al Jolson to The Beatles, from Piaf to Olivia Newton John, from Air Supply to The Seekers. ‚ÄúCarousel of Songs‚Äù is simply an explosion of styles. Twenty four hours later yet another opening night. A NIGHT IN PARIS, produced exclusively for The Juniors. Milko returning to the famous venue, leading a fabulous cast to dish out ‚Äúla cr√®me de la cr√®me‚Äù of French International music to 2 enthusiastic crowds roaring their appreciation. Two new works in the making. I DIDN‚ÄôT SEE THE TIME GO BY...The Aznavour Journey, designed for Theatres. A new production that draws from the Armenian heritage of the Legendary Charles Aznavour. From The mountains of Armenia to the bright lights of Paris. And LEGACY OF LOVE...The Engelbert Story. A recreation of two milestone performances of the British entertainer also known as ‚ÄúThe King of Romance‚Äù. The best moments of the 1985 Engelbert Spectacular at The Royal Albert Hall & The Engelbert Live 2000 at The London Palladian. This latest production has been designed to be performed with a String Orchestra. In this audacious venture, Milko has teamed up with one of the most active, prolific & sought- after Orchestras in Australia: THE METROPOLITAN ORCHESTRA.

These are dictated by tradition and the sport's laws. Individual skills and tacticsBall handling and general athleticism= The most generic skill for a player is ball handling ‚Äì being familiar with the shape and weight of the football, how to securely grip and hold it, and how to predict its movement on the ground and through the air. Additionally, there is a strong emphasis on individual athleticism for players. Physical fitness is necessary because play sees few breaks, takes place across a field 150‚Äì180 metres long, and has few restrictions on player position on the ground. =Possession skills= Player takes a contested mark Possession of the football is required to score so a core group of skills relate to possessing the football. These include: * Marking ‚Äì e.g. arm or chest mark, overhead mark * Bouncing the ball ‚Äì e.g. running bounce * Pick up ‚Äì e.g. collecting an unclaimed ball while it is loose on the ground =Disposal skills= Player kicks a drop punt In order to progress the football across the field of play in order to gain advantage or score the football must be disposed of legally by the controlling player. This can be done by: * Kicking ‚Äì e.g. drop punt, torpedo punt, snap, banana kick; or * Handball In specific situations where a pause in play has occurred (e.g. a stoppage or ball-up from the umpire), the ball may be contested in a specific way: * Hitting out =Checking skills= Player prepares to tackle an opponent in possession of the ball While not in possession of the football, a player will still need to work to gain possession of the football, force an error from the opposing player, or to provide an advantage to a team-mate. * Smothering * Tackling * Bumping * Spoiling * Kicking * Shepherding =One percenters= These skills get their name from the minor advantage they gain for a team. * Spoil * Drawing a free kick * Intercept marks * Smother Styles of playDirect= Direct football, often referred to as playing up the guts, contested footy or corridor footy requires moving the ball on the shortest possible path from goal to goal, i.e. without going to the boundary of the field. This puts the ball into areas crowded with players. Direct football can result in frequent physical contests, and forwards are not always able to mark the ball. As a result, crumbers (small players at the fall of the ball) become more important are often instructed to run to pick up the loose ball In direct football, the role of ruckmen and midfield centre clearances become critical. =Possession= Modern professional football has seen the advent of possession football, making the game similar to Association football. In Australian football it is often referred to as playing keepings off. The aim of possession football is to avoid kicking the ball to a player under pressure, denying the opposition of opportunities to take possession. There are generally two ways that teams execute possession football in the modern game, marking and by handball. Kicking The rules governing catching a kicked ball allow for \\"possession football\\". A player who catches the ball (called taking a mark) gets a short time period where they can kick the ball without being tackled or interfered with. Teams will sometimes kick backwards to allow a teammate to take a mark. This prevents the team losing possession. The AFL has experimented with rules in the NAB Cup to prevent this anti-competitive play. Handball Although the rules allowed for the handball most Australian rules leagues handball was largely a secondary skill to the kick. The handball has become a far more widely used skill in the contemporary game. =Tempo football= The term Tempo football was coined by commentators to describe the tactic of controlling the tempo of the game. Australian rules is a game in which teams can score very quickly and gain a psychological advantage to overwhelm their opponents. When a team looks like getting a run on, opposition sides sometimes play tempo football to deliberately slow down the game. This may include forcing a bounce (either through scrimmages or forcing the ball out of bounds, flooding or through playing possession football and timewasting). Once in possession, they may then speed up the game with direct or running football. Commentators labelled the Sydney Swans 2005 premiership team masters at tempo football and they were also widely criticized for it. Set playsKick-ins= After a behind has been scored, a designated kicker must return the ball to play from the goal square. Kick-ins are one of the most strategic set plays in the game of Australian football. 7-point play The term \\"7-point play\\" was coined by commentators to describe the situation where a team has been able to convert a missed goal (behind) into 7 points by stealing the ball directly from a kick-in and scoring a goal. Zone The zone defence at kick ins was popularised by Kevin Sheedy and brought from basketball. The opposition forwards will disperse approximately 20 metres apart in the defensive 50-metre arc. The main methods were used to penetrate the zone: * Long kicking (such as the torpedo punt), typically with the target being a ruckman or other tall player * Short kicking (typically to a fast running back pocket player), although this can be risky as it is closer to goal * Fullback play-on ‚Äì this requires the fullback to perform a solo move to leave the goalsquare and run on, gaining enough distance to break the zone Cluster The cluster involves players from the team kicking the ball in congregating at the top of the 50-metre arc and breaking in different directions. The player kicking in will typically have a designated spot or target player to kick to. The opposition team will often resort to a zone defence to successfully counter this tactic, and hence it is rarely used. =Bounces and throw-ins= Bounces and throw-ins are critical set plays in Australian football, and the ruckmen and midfielders will often use these opportunities to execute specific set- play strategies. Defensive tacticsRushed behinds= A strategy for defenders was to deliberately concede a point (behind) to regain possession of the ball. Some spectacular examples of this include Mal Michael's controversial \\"own goal\\" from 30 metres. Under coach Alastair Clarkson, Hawthorn used this tactic in the 2008 AFL Grand Final, conceding 11 rushed behinds. It caused the AFL to review the laws and award a free kick for deliberate rushed behinds. =Flooding= Flooding exploits the freedom of movement of players around the ground. It involves the coach releasing players in the forward line from their set positions and directing them to the opposition forward area, congesting the area and making it more difficult for the opposition to score. It is commonly deployed to protect a lead, or prevent a rout. This is possible due to the lack of an offside rule or similar restrictions on players field movements. In 2000, it was infamously employed by the Western Bulldogs to end Essendon's 20-game winning streak. =Rolling zone= The rolling zone or cluster, pioneered by Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson executes the zone defence, but across the entire field. Such a tactic requires extreme fitness and co-ordination of the entire team. Teams can break the rolling zone by playing direct football, or kicking long to a contest. Attacking tacticsPrimary target= Before the 1980s, teams would often simply kick high to a full forward whose role was to kick goals. Allan Jeans used Jason Dunstall as a lead up full forward and established a new breed of lead up full forward who would lead up the ground in a straight line, providing midfielders with a large, fast and strong running target to kick to. This made it very difficult for opposition sides and lead up full forwards would provide game winning firepower. Such players included Tony Lockett, Gary Ablett and Tony Modra. In response to the lead up full forward, opposition teams will often double team a full forward and stand \\"in the hole\\" (often tall ruckmen) to prevent them from leading into open space. In response, coaches began recruiting specialist decoy forward or secondary target who were able to run in a different direction to the primary target and were accurate at set shots. More recently, flooding and other defensive tactics have denied opportunities for using both the primary and secondary target tactics. =Forward play=Pagan's paddock North Melbourne coach Denis Pagan pioneered a technique called Pagan's Paddock, which involves ordering all attacking players to clear the attacking 50 metres of players and bombing the ball into the open space. This would give key forwards (in his case specifically Wayne Carey) room to run into, often running with the flight of the ball toward goal. In recent times, a similar tactic for the Sydney Swans' Lance Franklin has been described as Buddy's box. Rotating forwards Rotating forwards is a tactic where coaches move and change forward players to exploit different match ups create space to lead diagonally when the ball is inside the 50 metre arc. Forward pressure Historically forwards were \\"stay at home\\" players, lacked endurance and would not run and chase. This allowed defenders to run out and set up long attacking players. This has changed significantly and modern forwards are expected to chase down and tackle defenders and in fact steal goals. Leigh Matthews' triple-premiership- winning Brisbane Lions (which had superstar players such as Jason Akermanis) excelled at applying forward pressure on opposition teams. These days, shorter, faster forwards such as Aaron Davey are becoming increasingly popular for applying forward pressure, and they are credited with revolutionising the attacking game. =Running in waves= Hawthorn's dominant 1980s team used the tactic of running in waves using multiple handballs to draw the man, move the ball down the field and open holes in the attack in a similar way to rugby. In recent years, the tactic has been revitalised by the Geelong Football Club. Intimidation and attrition tactics An often overlooked tactic in Australian football is using attrition, violence and intimidation in an attempt to win matches. =Attrition= The aim is often to physically wear down the opposition or to deliberately \\"take out\\" a key player. Historically this tactic is called \\"playing the man\\" (as opposed to playing the ball). The attrition tactic has been used to reduce teams to less than 18 fit players on the field, resulting in the offending side having the advantage of extra players. The 1945 VFL Grand Final was dubbed \\"The Bloodbath\\" Grand Final due to the violence resulting in sixteen reportable offences. During the 1980s, attrition tactics became a popular tactic. The 1989 VFL Grand Final (informally dubbed \\"The Battle of '89\\") is probably the most famous of all matches of attrition football, with when two physically dominant and aggressive teams lined up against each other. At the start of the match an attack occurred on Dermott Brereton with the intention of taking him out of the game. This set the tone for a match in which several key players were hospitalised including Brownlow medalists John Platten and Robert Dipierdomenico (in an incident involving Geelong's Gary Ablett). =Unsociable football= While the rules are more strict in the modern game (in the AFL there are now strict fines for melees for example), some teams still engage in \\"unsociable football\\". Targeting the bodies of other players, \\"professional free kicks\\" would often be conceded and sometimes even suspension. Even playing strictly within the rules, tackles can be extremely vigorous and injury-causing and occasionally teams appear to have a tactic of directing the strongest tackles towards a particular opposition player. In a match during the 2005 AFL season, an incident of unsociable football was accused of bringing the game into disrepute when an injured Nick Riewoldt was targeted by two Brisbane Lions players. Riewoldt had broken his collar bone and whilst he grimaced in pain, he was subsequently aggressively bumped by the Brisbane's Chris Scott and Mal Michael before he left the ground.

The five dance halls of Shiva are Chidambaram, Madurai, Thiruvalangadu, Tirunelveli and Kutralam. Kutralam is also known as Trikootaachalam. Location Kutralam is a popular tourist resort in Southern Tamil Nadu known for its waterfalls, amidst picturesque surroundings - and is a source of inspiration of many a literary work. Thousands visit this town when the waterfalls are in season. Mythology The sage Agastyar, at Shiva's request, proceeded southward to stabilize the balance of the earth, and relieve the instability caused by the multitude of entities at Shiva's and Parvati's wedding in the Himalayas, to wait for a glimpse of the divine couple. There he is said to have created the Shivalingam here by shrinking an image of Vishnu, hence the name Kutralam. Temple structure The temple has a conch shaped temple(prakaram(closed precincts of a temple)) plan and is referred to as Sangakkovil. In the shrine, Shiva showed himself as Bhrama and Vishnu. The presiding deity lord Shiva is called as Kuttralanathar and the Ambal his consort mother Parvathy is called as Kuzhalvoi Mozhiammai. The Tirikootamandapam here is the site of festivities here. Parvati's shrine is also of significance here and is regarded as one of the 64 Shakti Peethams. The Chitra Sabhai or the hall of pictures is located in a picturesque locale away from the main temple. Architecturally the Chitrasabha resembles that of the other Nataraja Sabhas elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, and its interior is decked with hundreds of murals, depicting images from the Indian epics. Natarajar is brought here during festivals from the Kurumpalaveesar temple. The sthala vriksham is Kurum Palaa and the Theertham is Chitranadhi. Nataraja is sported with Nritya Thandavam posture. Poems on this temple Tirikootaraasappakavirayar's well known work Kutrala Kuravanji glorifies this shrine. Kurumpalaveesar, sung in Tevaram was done by Sambandar.

Life He was born in London 5 September 1788. He was the son of George Macfarren. He was educated chiefly at Archbishop Tenison's school in Castle Street, Leicester Square, and while there he wrote a tragedy which was privately played by his school-fellows, with the support of Edmund Kean, then a boy of their own age. Macfarren was also something of a musician, and according to his son, Sir G. Macfarren, \\"he could sustain either of the parts in a violin quartet,\\" and \\"had he not met with a fashionable teacher of dancing, named Bishop, who offered to make him a gentleman instead of a fiddler, he would have adopted music as his profession\\". He was the first teacher of James Oury the violinist, and while still under twenty years of age he opened a dancing academy of his own. In 1816, he visited Paris, where he had lessons in dancing from the best teachers. His natural bent was, however, towards the stage, and on 28 September 1818, his first publicly performed dramatic work, \\"Ah! what a Pity, or the Dark Knight and the Fair Lady,\\" was given at the English Opera House (for the benefit of John Pritt Harley); from this date almost every year witnessed the production of some piece or other from his pen. In February 1831, he took over the management of the theatre in Tottenham Street, which he called the Queen's Theatre, in honour of Queen Adelaide, and here he remained until July of the following year, producing, among numerous other works, a dramatic version of Handel's \\"Acis and Galatea,\\" for which Cipriani Potter wrote additional accompaniments. Macfarren seems to have laid special stress upon accuracy of detail and naturalness in staging the plays which he produced. Robert Elliston, successively lessee of Drury Lane, the Olympic, and Surrey Theatres, stated that \\"no such perfect pictures as he saw at the Queen's Theatre had ever been put on the stage.\\" Macfarren left the Queen's on being appointed stage-manager of the Surrey. He afterwards went to the Strand. In 1834, he visited Milan, where his daughter was studying singing, and there wrote the libretto of an opera, \\"Caractacus.\\" During some years of his life Macfarren was totally blind, but a year before his death he underwent an operation for cataract and recovered his sight. While blind he devoted himself largely to literature, and he first suggested the formation of the Handel Society. In 1841, he became editor and proprietor of the \\"Musical World.\\" He died suddenly on 24 April 1843 in Castle Street, Leicester Square. Family Macfarren married, in August 1808, Elizabeth (born 20 Jan. 1792), daughter of John Jackson, a bookbinder, of Glasgow, who had settled in London. Their eldest son was Sir George Alexander Macfarren and their youngest Walter Cecil Macfarren. Works * Ah!

It prints feature journalism, fiction, opinions, art, and miscellaneous shorter pieces; one of its taglines reads: \\"Where fact and fiction meet.\\" The relatively unrestricted scope of the publication ensures that any thought- provoking topic may be considered for a feature. History Founding = Kitsch was founded in January 2003 by two then-freshmen at Cornell, Katie Jentleson and Samantha Henig. Jentleson and Henig had both been highly involved in feature journalism at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland. Upon arriving at Cornell in the fall of 2002, they found themselves underwhelmed at the university's journalism scene, which consisted mainly of The Cornell Daily Sun and a large number of poetry magazines. Jentleson and Henig perceived a need for a publication \\"falling on the line between [them].\\" In the second semester of their freshman year, they established Kitsch to fill this gap, and published the first issue for release on Cornell's campus in the spring of 2003. It featured a mix of articles about life on campus, life off-campus, and entertainment, as well as a collection of fiction, art, and photography. Similarly-structured issues were produced during each of the next four semesters. In the fall of 2005, Jentleson and Henig became concerned about the future of the publication. Both founders were to graduate from Cornell and had no clear successors to keep the publication active. A strong recruitment effort during the fall semester of 2005 yielded over a dozen new members to the staff of Kitsch, primarily from the class of 2009, ensuring the survival of the publication. After Jentleson and Henig graduated, the position of co-editors-in-chief was passed to Robert Ochshorn and D. Evan Mulvihill, both class of 2009. Notably, Ochshorn, as the former editor-in-chief of the Ithaca High School Tattler, had been a central figure in that publication's 2005 controversy, in which a group of students sued the Ithaca City School District, alleging unconstitutional censorship of the Tattler. =Development and expansion= Three major changes to the magazine were announced for the fall semester of 2007. First, the magazine began to sell advertisements for local businesses. Second, the staff reached out to interested students at Ithaca College and worked to make Kitsch a production of both institutions. Third, the internal editorial structure of the magazine was overhauled, replacing the loose and centralized system of editing helmed by Jentleson and Henig with one organized into sections according to topic, with individual sub-editors for each. These sections include: *Bite Size (the introductory pages, a mix of short and often playful recurring features) *Zooming In (matters pertaining to campus-life at either college, or to issues affecting the town of Ithaca, New York) *Zooming Out (life outside Ithaca) *Watch & Listen (entertainment and pop culture) *Fiction Students were also recruited into new positions in advertising, business, distribution, and coordination with the Ithaca College group. Ochshorn and Mulvihill retained their positions as co-editors-in-chief for Fall 2007, but Mulvihill left the position in the spring of 2008 in order to spearhead the effort to launch a set of new online blogs for Kitsch (see external links). The intention at the beginning of 2007-08 was to produce four issues over the course of the school- year instead of two. Enthusiasm was high, and the first issue was produced in half the usual amount of time; however, the second issue took much longer to compile. Furthermore, in the spring, Kitsch abruptly ran out of money, leading to a number of fundraising efforts (e.g. a bake-sale). The final issue was finally produced and released at the end of the summer of 2008, and Peter Fritch was inducted as the general editor for 2008-09\\\\. =Funding controversy of 2009= As in the year before, Kitsch encountered funding difficulties in the spring of 2009, but this time in the form of a suspension of funding from Cornell's Student Activities Funding Commission when Kitsch‚Ä≤s Cornell editorial board made a technical error during the funding pre-application process. Despite the fact that the error was caught before the deadline for the main funding application, Kitsch was denied the opportunity to correct its error or apply for funding. The SAFC declared that nothing could be done to give Kitsch any money that semester. Funds from Ithaca College, advertising, subscriptions, and other Cornell sources (most importantly, the Department of History and the Cornell Council for the Arts) enabled Kitsch to print one issue in the spring semester, but not two as originally planned. Fritch would later call the actions of the SAFC \\"disproportionate‚Ä¶ absurd and unfair\\". Issue production cycle The process by which an issue of Kitsch is compiled is fairly organic and informal. Aspiring writers (either with ideas in hand or not) attend group meetings to share and exchange story ideas. From the pool of possible feature topics thus generated, writers claim ideas to work on and produce a rough draft. These drafts are edited by the sub-editor whose section corresponds best to the topic, and is then returned to the writer to be further worked on. In the meantime, at least one artist is assigned to illustrate each article. When the editor is satisfied with a draft, it is submitted to the copy-editors and layout staff, who check over the articles and design the page layouts of each article and its illustrations. Submissions of art and fiction are processed in a similar way for inclusion in the final product. As issues begin to take shape, the editorial staff often inspects the completed stories and features for commonalities. When a common thread exists among several submissions, the design and layout of the issue may be stylized around that central theme. Past themes have included the \\"Exposure\\" issue (Spring 2005), the \\"Romance\\" issue (Fall 2008), the \\"War\\" issue (Summer 2008), and the \\"Exploitation\\" issue (Spring 2009). It is important to note, however, that these themes do not dictate in advance the sorts of stories selected for inclusion in a given issue--rather, the theme is determined only in retrospect.

Park College was selected as a training center for the V-12 Navy College Training Program from 1943 to 1945. This partnership between the Navy and Park College may have led to the naming of a ship in the college's honor.

The survivors underwent severe hardship, as the winter storm brought with it up to three feet of snow, through which the survivors had to make their way after having been brought ashore, many of them bare foot. The Park Victory sinking was the first exposure of the Ut√∂ pilot and lighthouse crew community to contemporary American culture. The interracial relations on Park Victory shocked them and sparked legends that were shared for decades.

After the crew returned home, the helpful islanders were sent coffee and sugar to thank the people who brought them to the shore and took them to shelter in their homes. The villagers sold the gift sugar and coffee, which was scarce just after the war, and with the money, they went on to order a special commemorative silver candle holder that holds 10 candles. On the candle holder are engraved the names of crew members who perished in the accident.

He was said to inhabit Mount Penglai. Anqi was said to have been a Taoist wizard, able to render himself visible or invisible at his pleasure. According to the Daoist hagiography Liexian Zhuan, Qin Shi Huang spoke with him for three entire days (including nights), and offered Anqi jade and gold. Qin Shi Huang feared death, and sought immortality, without success. In 219 BC, he sent an expedition under Xu Fu to find Anqi and to bring him back, along with the elixir of life, which grants immortality or eternal youth. When Xu Fu reported that a sea creature blocked the expedition's path, Qin Shi Huang sent archers to kill it. In 210 BC, Xu Fu continued his journey. Legend says he found Japan instead, proclaimed himself king, and never returned. The Records of the Grand Historian state that Li Shaojun visited Anqi Sheng during his travels. There is no record, however, of where they met or of Mount Penglai itself. In 130 BC, Emperor Wu of Han also sent an expedition to find Anqi, which proved unsuccessful. Anqi holds an important place in the Taiqing and Shangqing Schools.

She is considered to be the last intact cruising training ship from the 1890s.  History  The ship was originally built for the Argentine Naval Academy. ARA Presidente Sarmiento made thirty seven annual training cruises including six circumnavigations of the globe. The ship was retired as a seagoing vessel in 1938, but continued to serve without sails on Argentine rivers around 1950 and as a stationary training ship until 1961. She is now maintained in her original 1898 appearance as a museum ship in Puerto Madero near downtown Buenos Aires. Propulsion and auxiliaries Rigging  Engine = In addition to its sailing rig this ship includes a large triple expansion steam engine supplied by two coal-fired boilers exhausting through the rear stack. An additional auxiliary boiler exhausting through the forward stack provides steam for other than propulsion, including two engines driving electrical generators on the main deck (below the weather deck). Fuel A single coal bunker is positioned between the main and auxiliary boiler rooms =Steering= Helm A three-wheel chain drive allows up to six helmsmen to control the rudder. Such a crew of operators was not always required due to the inclusion of an electric servo-drive for normal operation but was useful for the training of cadets.  Armament  Artillery = Four five inch mounts are positioned amidships, two on each side, with additional smaller weapons. Documentation on the ship shows these having had some armor, but the present installations are bare. = Torpedoes = A single torpedo scuttle using gravity expulsion exited at the bow. The scuttle has been removed and the exit port welded shut, but in the current museum configuration a torpedo is suspended in a position on the main deck ready to enter the former scuttle entrance. Additional torpedo storage is provided below this main deck.

It is one of his earliest known poems and was written for a school assignment while Coleridge attended Christ's Hospital. The poem describes the pain of solitude that accompanies travel and the risks that accompany a voyage at sea, including combat against others and resorting to cannibalism. Background \\"Dura Navis\\", along with \\"Easter Holidays\\" and \\"Niul Pejus est Caelibe Vita\\", is one of Coleridge's earliest known poems.Sarker 2001 p. 43 \\"Dura Navis\\" was written for an exercise while Coleridge attended Christ's Hospital at the age of 15. Of this exercise Coleridge wrote in a note to the poem: > I well remember old Jemmy Bowyer, the plagose Orbilius of Christ's Hospital, > but an admirable Educer no less than Educator of the Intellect, bad me leave > out as many epithets as would turn the whole into 8-syllable Lines,-and then > asked myself if the Exercise would not be greatly improved. How often have I > thought of this proposal since then-and how many thousand bloated and > puffing lines have I read that by this process would have tripped over the > tongues excellently. Likewise I remember that he told me on the same > occasion‚Äî'Coleridge! the connections of a Declamation are not the > transitions of Poetry‚Äîbad, however, as they are, they are better than > \\"Apostrophes\\" and \\"O thou's,\\" for at the worst they are something like > common sense. The others are the grimaces of Lunacy'.Sampson 1920 p. 269 Poem The poem begins by describing a voyage, an image connected to his own separation from home:Yarlott 1967 p. 3 Then the poem portrays the emergence of the moon:Kneale 1999 p. 79 Eventually, the traveller becomes involved with a battle at sea:Ashton 1997 p. 28 As the poem continues, the narrator puts forth the idea that if the traveller survives, there is also the threat of having to resort to cannibalism: Themes The poem describes many images that appear throughout Coleridge's early works. The emergence of the moon in a baroque manner, and this image reappears in his poem \\"To the Autumnal Moon\\" and in his \\"The Nightingale\\".Kneale 1999 79‚Äì80 In terms of themes, \\"Dura Navis\\", like Coleridge's other early poems, incorporates a Plotinus-like view that people should live more simply and control their passions and desires.Werkmeister 1961 p. 110 \\"Dura Navis\\" is dominated by the image of a voyage that is possibly a reference to Frank Coleridge, Coleridge's brother and a sailor. Although Frank left home at the age of 11, there are parallels to Coleridge's own life and his loneliness at Christ's Hospital.Ashton 1997 p. 27 To Coleridge, travel is related to the idea of solitude and of travel found within many of his early works and later in his Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Coleridge was to later emphasises the need of companionship to overcome the loneliness of life.Yarlott 1967 pp. 2‚Äì3 Critical response An article in late 19th-century The University Magazine and Free Review attributed the failure of Coleridge's early poetry to his education. Boyer did teach the students literature and emphasised simplicity within poetry as Coleridge's account of Boyer's correcting of \\"Dura Navis\\". However, \\"It was still the day of mechanical scansion and didactic appreciation\\" and the education \\"did not then include Spenser; and not from Boyer would a pupil learn the magic of Milton's and Shakespere's rhythms.\\"Robertson and Astor 1894 p. 309 A few years later, Walter De la Mare said he believed that the \\"best line\\" in the poem \\"would have been ruined had Coleridge taken\\" the advice of his schoolmaster.De la Mare 1935 p. 513 ReferencesSources= * Ashton, Rosemary.

At , it is the largest park on the peninsula. It is bordered by The Citadel to the west, Hampton Park Terrace to the south, North Central to the east, and Wagener Terrace to the north. The park is named in honor of Confederate General Wade Hampton III who, at the time of the Civil War, owned one of the largest collections of slaves in the South. After the Civil War, Hampton became a proponent of the Lost Cause movement, member of the Red Shirts and governor of South Carolina.  History Colonial era= The land constituting current-day Hampton Park was, by 1769, part of a plantation owned by John Gibbes and known as The Grove or Orange Grove Plantation.Judith A. Hines, Layers of the Landscape at Hampton Park, pp. 2‚Äì5 (2006). =Race course= The grandstands at the racetrack were designed by Charles F. Reichart.In 1835, part of Gibbes' plantation was acquired by the South Carolina Jockey Club, a group that developed the Washington Race Course on the site. An annual horse race in February attracted thousands of spectators who could watch the races from an Italianate grandstand designed by Charles F. Reichardt.Judith A. Hines, Layers of the Landscape at Hampton Park 5 (2006). Today, Mary Murray Drive is a parkway that circles Hampton Park in almost the exact location of the race track. =Union cemetery= During the closing days of the American Civil War, the area was used as a prisoner-of-war camp. More than two hundred Union soldiers died in the camp and were buried in a mass grave at the site. Union soldiers were buried behind the old racetrack's stands near the present intersection of Tenth Avenue and Mary Murray Drive. In an article titled \\"The First Decoration Day\\", David W. Blight of Yale has written: , David W. Blight, \\"The First Decoration Day\\", for the Newark Star Ledger. \\"The city was largely abandoned by white residents by late February. Among the first troops to enter and march up Meeting Street singing liberation songs was the 21st U. S. Colored Infantry; their commander accepted the formal surrender of the city. \\"Thousands of black Charlestonians, most former slaves, remained in the city and conducted a series of commemorations to declare their sense of the meaning of the war. The largest of these events, and unknown until some extraordinary luck in my recent research, took place on May 1, 1865. During the final year of the war, the Confederates had converted the planters' horse track, the Washington Race Course and Jockey Club, into an outdoor prison. Union soldiers were kept in horrible conditions in the interior of the track; at least 257 died of exposure and disease and were hastily buried in a mass grave behind the grandstand. Some twenty-eight black workmen went to the site, re-buried the Union dead properly, and built a high fence around the cemetery. They whitewashed the fence and built an archway over an entrance on which they inscribed the words, 'Martyrs of the Race Course'. \\"Then, black Charlestonians in cooperation with white missionaries and teachers, staged an unforgettable parade of 10,000 people on the slaveholders' race course. The symbolic power of the low-country planter aristocracy's horse track (where they had displayed their wealth, leisure, and influence) was not lost on the freedpeople. A New York Tribune correspondent witnessed the event, describing 'a procession of friends and mourners as South Carolina and the United States never saw before.' \\"At 9 am on May 1, the procession stepped off led by three thousand black schoolchildren carrying arm loads of roses and singing 'John Brown's Body.' The children were followed by several hundred black women with baskets of flowers, wreaths and crosses. Then came black men marching in cadence, followed by contingents of Union infantry and other black and white citizens. As many as possible gathering in the cemetery enclosure; a childrens' choir sang 'We'll Rally around the Flag,' the 'Star-Spangled Banner,' and several spirituals before several black ministers read from scripture. No record survives of which biblical passages rung out in the warm spring air, but the spirit of Leviticus 25 was surely present at those burial rites: 'for it is the jubilee; it shall be holy unto you ‚Ä¶ in the year of this jubilee he shall return every man unto his own possession.' \\"Following the solemn dedication the crowd dispersed into the infield and did what many of us do on Memorial Day: they enjoyed picnics, listened to speeches, and watched soldiers drill. Among the full brigade of Union infantry participating was the famous 54th Massachusetts and the 34th and 104th U.S. Colored Troops, who performed a special double-columned march around the gravesite. The war was over, and Decoration Day had been founded by African Americans in a ritual of remembrance and consecration. The war, they had boldly announced, had been all about the triumph of their emancipation over a slaveholders' republic, and not about state rights, defense of home, nor merely soldiers' valor and sacrifice.\\" By late April 1865, a white picket fence on which was written \\"The Martyrs of the Race Course\\" had been erected.Harper's Weekly, May 18, 1865. On May 1, 1865, thousands of people, mainly newly freed blacks, processed to the site, and members of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry marched around the site. The graves were decorated, speeches were offered, and celebrants enjoyed picnics in the area.Charleston (S.C.) Courier, May 21, 1865. This has been cited as the first Memorial Day celebration. By 1871, the cemetery was suffering neglect, and the soldiers were reinterred at the Beaufort and Florence National Cemeteries. In their 2014 book The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America, Bellware and Gardiner take issue with Blight's characterization of this event as the first Memorial Day. While appealing in its inclusiveness, the event lacks the intention to begin an annual tradition. It was a cemetery dedication, not unlike the one at Gettysburg two years earlier. It was a celebration of the fall of Charleston done in conjunction with the floral-themed May Day holiday. This was a one-time event and not meant to reoccur. When asked by the New York Times for proof of his assertion that it influenced General John A. Logan's inauguration of the national holiday, Blight confessed he had none. Bellware and Gardiner credit Mary Ann Williams and the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia as the true originators of the holiday as abundant contemporaneous evidence from across the nation exists to substantiate the claim. After the Civil War, the Jockey Club was unable to resume the popular racing season, and the land was leased for farming. In 1899, the Charleston Jockey Club disbanded, and its assets were given to the Charleston Library Society in 1900. The remnants of the racing structures were removed, but August Belmont was given the gates to the course which he had installed at Belmont Park in New York.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/20/101990487.pdf New York Times, April 20, 1903 (retrieved May 27, 2009). =Trade exposition= At the turn of the century, Charleston hosted a regional trade exposition. The South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition of 1901‚Äì1902 was held on a large tract of land, including the former race course. The exposition opened on December 1, 1901, and attracted 674,086 attendees during its run. On April 9, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt attended the exposition. Nevertheless, the trade exposition was a financial failure, and it closed on May 31, 1902.J.C. Hemphill, A Short Story on the South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition, reprinted in City of Charleston, South Carolina, Year Book appx. at 163 (1902). Park The city of Charleston acquired a part of the exposition land for a park. The park is named in honor of Confederate General Wade Hampton III who, at the time of the Civil War was one of the largest enslavers in the South. After the Civil War, Hampton became a proponent of the Lost Cause movement, member of the Red Shirts and governor of South Carolina. The bandstand from the trade exposition, once located in the center of the park, was saved and moved to its present location at the east edge of the park at the foot of Cleveland St.Robert N.

In addition, the building at 30 Mary Murray Blvd., which is currently used as the city's Parks Department offices, was retained from the exposition, where it served as a tea house. The city retained the services of Olmsted, Olmsted & Elliott, a landscaping firm from Boston. John Charles Olmsted, the adopted son of Frederick Law Olmsted, designed a plan for a park following his first visit to Charleston in 1906.Judith A. Hines, Layers of the Landscape at Hampton Park 10 (2006). At least part of his plans for long parkways along the Ashley River were disrupted when the city sold the approximately along the Ashley River, the Rhett Farm tract, to the Citadel for the relocation and expansion of its campus.1919 S.C. Acts No. 216 (approval of transfer). During the mid-20th century, the park included a zoo. It was opened in 1932, and an aviary was added about six years later.Charleston (S.C.) News & Courier, Dec. 1, 1938 at 16. Most of the animals, including a lion, were donated to the zoo or bred at the zoo. By the mid-1960s, the zoo had become run-down.Charleston (S.C.) News & Courier, Dec. 4, 1965 at 1-B. The zoo closed in 1975, and its contents were largely transferred to Charles Towne Landing, a new state park.Charleston (S.C.) News & Courier, Apr. 29, 1975, at 1-A. The city began a redevelopment of the park starting in the early 1980s. Following several years of decline in the park's condition, the city refocused landscaping efforts on the park, reduced crime, and installed a small snack stand designed by Sandy Logan. The concession stand had been shuttered for many years but was renovated in 2019 and renamed the \\"Rose Pavilion.\\" The refurbished park reopened in June 1984 after a year of improvement work when the Piccolo Spoleto finale was held at Hampton Park. The park is popular with walkers, joggers, and cyclists who use the perimeter road for exercise. In previous years, the park was the location for the finale of the Piccolo Spoleto Festival and in present-day remains the site for the MOJA Festival in addition to many weddings and other special events. Charleston, South Carolina (Note: The Finale of the Spoleto Festival USA has been moved to Middleton Place, a nearby historical plantation.) In May 2015, a non-profit known as the Charleston Parks Conservancy unveiled a proposal to rework parts of the park. The plan would restore the c. 1901 structure at 30 Mary Murray Blvd. and rework the neighboring stables as part of a special events venue. In a different phase of the master plan, the stand- alone snack stand was designated to again become an active food station. The renovation of the snack stand was completed in 2019. The snack stand became the Rose Pavilion, a public gathering place.

(2002). Foundations of Risk Management and Insurance, 6.3. 1st edition. AICPCU. or whether a particular client is insurable for by a particular company because of particular circumstance and the quality assigned by an insurance provider pertaining to the risk that a given client would have.See The Free Dictionary definition of Insurability. Accessed June 18, 2009. An individual with very low insurability may be said to be uninsurable, and an insurance company will refuse to issue a policy to such an applicant. For example, an individual with a terminal illness and a life expectancy of 6 months would be uninsurable for term life insurance. This is because the probability is so high for the individual to die within the term of the insurance, that he/she would present far too high a liability for the insurance company. A similar, and stereotypical, example would be earthquake insurance in California. Insurability is sometimes an issue in case law of torts and contracts. It also comes up in issues involving tontines and insurance fraud schemes. In real property law and real estate, insurability of title means the realty is marketable.  Characteristics of insurable risks  Risks that can be insured by private companies typically share seven common characteristics.This discussion is adapted from Mehr and Camack ‚ÄúPrinciples of Insurance‚Äù, 6th edition, 1976, pp 34 ‚Äì 37. #Large number of similar exposure units. Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the law of large numbers in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include Lloyd's of London, which is famous for insuring the life or health of actors, actresses and sports figures. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different rates. #Definite Loss. The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements. #Accidental Loss. The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be ‚Äòpure,‚Äô in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks, are generally not considered insurable. #Large Loss. The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses. There is little point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer. #Affordable Premium. If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, it is not likely that anyone will buy insurance, even if on offer. Further, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance of loss, the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance. (See the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board standard number 113) #Calculable Loss. There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim. #Limited risk of catastrophically large losses. Insurable losses are ideally independent and non-catastrophic, meaning that the one losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, on the order of 5 percent. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the U.S., flood risk is insured by the federal government. An instance where the question whether insurability exists is contested is the case of nanotechnology.Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society, edited by David H. Guston, Sage Publications, 2010; see Articles on Insurance and Reinsurance. In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market. Insurable interest Insurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured.The Free Dictionary definition of Insurable interest, citing cases at 1 Burr. 489. See 20 Pick. 259; 1 Pet. 163. Accessed June 18, 2009.Anthony Steuer, Questions and Answers on Life Insurance: The Life Insurance Toolbook, p. 310 (Anthony Steuer, 2007) found at Google Books. Accessed June 18, 2009. It may also mean the interest of a beneficiary of a life insurance policy to prove need for the proceeds, called the \\"insurable interest doctrine\\". Specifically, insurable interest is: Thus, husbands/wives have an insurable interest in their spouse, and children have an insurable interest in their parents (and vice versa). Close relatives are assumed to have an insurable interest in the lives of those relatives, but more distant relatives, such as cousins and in-laws cannot buy insurance of the lives of others related by these connections. A person is presumed to have an insurable interest in his or her own life,Griffiths v. Fleming [1909] 1 KB 805; M'Farlane v. Royal London Friendly Society (1886) 2 TLR 755 preferring to be alive and in good health rather than being sick, injured or dead. If a person obtains an insurance policy on their own life, it is presumed that the person would only name a beneficiary who wants the insured to be alive and healthy. A person is considered to have an unlimited interest in the life of their spouse, which the law considers broadly equivalent to having an insurable interest in their own life. Even if not financially dependent on the other, it is legitimate to insure against the death of a spouse.Griffiths v. Fleming [1909] 1 KB 805; Married Women's Property Act 1882, section 11. Although many insurers will accept policies of cohabiting couples, they could potentially be invalidated. In recent years, there have been moves to pass clear statutory provisions in this regard, which have not yet borne fruit.Report on Family Law; Cohabitation, s. XVI , Scottish Law Commission. Similar treatment was recently extended to civil partners under section 253 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and in the law of some states. Insurable interest is no longer strictly an element of life insurance contracts under modern law, for example with viatication agreements and charitable donations. Often there is no requirement today that the beneficiary have a proven insurable interest in the life of the insured when the insured has purchased the insurance.

Allied with Garc√≠a was his brother Ferdinand I of Castile, and Ramiro brought with him his Moorish allies, the kings of the taifas of Zaragoza, Tudela, and Huesca. According to the earliest source, the Historia Silense, the battle took place in 1035, but in the early modern period the Navarrese historian Jos√© de Moret re-dated it to 1043 on the basis of a document of that year by which Garc√≠a granted his alf√©rez Fort√∫n S√°nchez the village of Ororbia in gratitude for a black horse which Sancho had given him and which the king had used in the battle of Tafalla.Canellas L√≥pez, 140, places it in August 1037, the same year Ferdinand defeated Vermudo III of Le√≥n at Tamar√≥n. The Historia places the battle shortly after the death of Garc√≠a and Ramiro's father, Sancho the Great (18 October 1035), while Garc√≠a was returning from a pilgrimage to Rome.Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, 719. Taking advantage of his brother's absence, Ramiro is said to have invaded Navarre with the intention of expanding his own Kingdom of Aragon or seizing Garc√≠a's throne, despite his vow to his father to maintain peace with his brothers. Garc√≠a returned in time to ally with their other brother, surprise and surround Ramiro, who had to flee the field shamefully, barefoot atop a horse without spurs or a bit, according to the later chronicler Lucas de Tuy. He left behind his baggage, arms, tents, and that black horse captured by the Navarrese alf√©rez.Canellas L√≥pez, 140. At Torreta and Barranquel, Garc√≠a erected two large rocks in memory of his victory. Spanish historian Justo P√©rez de Urbel argues on the basis of some coinage of Garc√≠a's minted at Jaca, Ramiro's capital, that the Navarrese king overran the Aragonese kingdom after his victory. The brothers were reconciled by 2 November 1044, when all three of them met at Garc√≠a's capital of N√°jera to discuss a campaign of reconquista against Calahorra the next year.P√©rez de Urbel, 25. Probably Garc√≠a's mother, Muniadona of Castile, interceded on behalf of Ramiro, who, if a later story in the Chronica Naierensis is to be believed, had once defended her against Garc√≠a's false accusations of adultery. In a letter to Paternus, abbot of San Juan de la Pe√±a, that must be dated shortly before the confrontation at Tafalla, Odilo, abbot of Cluny, conveys, in words apparently meant to reach Ramiro, his support for the Aragonese in the impending war between the successors of Sancho the Great. He reassures Paternus that he has heard a good report about Ramiro from Sancho, Bishop of Pamplona, and that he has instructed the Cluniac monks to recite the psalms for the benefit of Ramiro. His reference to the threat ab incursione paganorum et a persecutione falsorum Christianorum (from the incursion of the pagans [Moors] and the persecution of false Christians [his brothers]) indicates he was unaware that Ramiro had allied with his Muslim neighbours.Bishko, 5‚Äì6 and note 34.

At its peak in the 1940s, Morocco's Jewish population exceeded 250,000, but due to the migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel and other nations, including Operation Yachin from 1961 to 1964, this number has been reduced to approximately 5,000. The vast majority of Moroccan Jews now live in Israel, where they constitute the second-largest Jewish community, approximately half a million. Other communities are found in France, Canada, Spain, the United States and South America, mainly in Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina. The affection and respect between Moroccan Jews and the Kingdom of Morocco is still palpable. Every year rabbis and community leaders across the world are invited for the Throne Celebration held every July 30th in Rabat. During the celebration in 2014, Rabbi Haim A. Moryoussef of Canada dedicated his book \\"Le Bon Oeil - Ben Porath Yossef\\" to the King Mohammed VI and offered him a handwritten blessing on parchment wishing him a healthy, long and successful life. History Etching of Jewish home in Mogador, Darondeau (1807‚Äì1841) Old Jewish quarter, Essaouira Moroccan Jews constitute an ancient community, immigrating to the region as early as 70 CE. In accordance with the norms of the Islamic legal system, Jewish Moroccans had separate legal courts pertaining to \\"personal law\\" under which communities (Muslim sharia, Christian Canon law and Jewish halakha law-abiding) were allowed to rule themselves under their own system. Particularly after the Alhambra Decree, many Sephardi Jews migrated from al-Andalus to the Maghreb as refugees fleeing the inquisition in Spain and Portugal. They are referred to as the Megorashim, while the Jews already in Morocco are referred to as the Toshavim. Many Iberian Jews settled in Fes and Marrakesh. In the following centuries, Conversos who had been banished to Iberian colonial possessions in the Americas and the Atlantic reclaimed their Judaism and also resettled in Morocco. In the mid 19th century, Moroccan Jews started migrating from the interior of the country to coastal cities such as Essaouira, Mazagan, Asfi, and later Casablanca for economic opportunity, participating in trade with Europeans and the development of those cities. The Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle opened its first school in Tetuan in 1862. After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, and due to domestic strife in the 1950s, the next several decades saw waves of Jewish emigration to Israel, France and Canada. Moroccan Jews emigrated for a variety of reasons. Some have emigrated to Israel for religious reasons, some faced persecution, and others left for better economic prospects than they faced in post-colonial Morocco. With every Arab-Israeli war, tensions between Arabs and Jews would rise, sparking more Jewish emigration. By the time of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, the majority of Morocco's Jewish population had emigrated. As a protectorate of France, parts of Morocco were heavily influenced by French culture, while the same is true of the portions of the country that belonged to Spain. Traditionally, the Jews were classified as being French-Moroccan or Spanish-Moroccan depending on where in Morocco they lived, and remnants of these classifications can be felt today. These differences are reflected in language, foods, last names and even liturgy. Most Jews in Morocco lived in desolate areas during the late 1930s. This was in part due to increased taxation by the French protectorate. In 1936, L√©on Blum, a Jewish man, was appointed as prime minister of France. This gave some Moroccan Jews hope that they may be able to become French citizens at some point, as Algerian Jews gained French citizenship with the Cr√©mieux Decree. Algerian Jews were granted right of passage to France, and this only furthered the desire of Moroccan Jews to embrace French culture to the extent of the Algerian Jews. Early photographs of Moroccan Jewish families, taken in the early 20th century by German explorer and photographer Hermann Burchardt, are now held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.Jewish couple in Morocco on the roof of their house; Jewish family during the Feast of Tabernacles on the roof of their house; Moroccan Jews in 1905, by Hermann Burchardt; Jewish family, 1905; The Saba Synagogue, 1905; Jewish family in their home; The Ibn (Aben) Danan Synagogue, in the Mellah of F√®s (click to enlarge); Jewish family in Morocco, early 20th century (click on photo to enlarge); Family portrait, Morocco. A small community of around 2,000‚Äì2,500 Jews live in Morocco today. However, in a rapidly increasing trend, young men from the community are emigrating to Israel and France. As of 2017, according to The Economist, \\"No Arab country has gone to the lengths of Morocco to revive its Jewish heritage.\\" The country has restored 110 synagogues and has the Arab world‚Äôs only Jewish museum. More than 50,000 Israelis visit Morocco annually. Communities today Beth-El Synagogue in Casablanca in 2017 Netivot Yisrael congregation in Brooklyn. Jewish cemetery, Essaouira * Morocco: In 2012 it was estimated that 2,000‚Äì2,500 Jews still lived in Morocco, mainly in Casablanca. Other towns are said to have smaller, aging populations. * Israel: The 1950s saw large waves of Jewish emigration from Morocco to Israel. Many Moroccan Jews were transferred to peripheral development towns while others settled in larger, established cities. Today, Jews of Moroccan descent can be found all across Israel. * France: Large communities in France include Paris, Marseille, Strasbourg, Lyon and Nice. * Argentina: Mainly in Buenos Aires and Rosario. * Brazil: Amazonian Jews mainly in Belem (about 450 families), Manaus (about 250 families) and Rio de Janeiro (about 100 families), with small communities scattered throughout the Amazon region. In 2009 made 200 years of the first wave of immigration to Amazon region. * Canada: In the 1950s Canada began extending visas to Jews from Morocco. Large communities developed in Montreal and Toronto. Moroccans were attracted to Canada because of its high quality of life and to Montreal in particular because of the French language. Toronto is known for its significant Moroccan population originating from cities such as Tangiers and Tetouan. In the recent past, however, an emergence of French-Moroccan musical liturgy and customs has been noticed even in this dominant Moroccan city. For example, the traditional Moroccan Bakashot, classical music sung by Sephardic Jews in the winter months across countries in the Middle East on Friday night, has come to life in recent productions by Magen David Congregation and Abir Ya'akob Congregation. * Venezuela: Concentrated mainly in Caracas. * Gibraltar: The Jewish community in Gibraltar originates from Tangiers and Tetouan. * United States: In 1972 the Moroccan Jewish Organization (MJO)Moroccan Jewish Organization (MJO) was founded. Founding Members created Moroccan Services & a Synagogue in Forest Hills, NY named Shaar Hashamayim Sephardic Synagogue. Members and Participants of MJO went on to create other Moroccan Synagogues and Batei Midrashot / Houses of [Torah] Study in Manhattan (Manhattan Sephardic Cong.), Brooklyn (Netivot Yisrael), Fort Lee, NJ, Cedarhurst (HaChaim veHaShalom) and Philadelphia, PA.  Jewish Quarters in Morocco  The Jewish quarters in Morocco were called mellahs. Jews in Morocco were considered dhimmis' under Muslim law, meaning that they were seen as an inferior religious group, that were distinguished from the Muslim majority, and were prevented from participating in certain activities.Deshen, Shlomo. \\"Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 20, no. 4 (1984): 212-23. doi:10.1080/00263208408700607 However, dhimmis such as Jews were tolerated, following the Pact of Umar in the 7th century, unlike the policy of intolerance that the Christians practiced with the Jews at that time in Europe. Sultans put Jews in the mellahs, as what most see as an attempt to ostracize the Jews, and keep them from being exposed to insurgents.Deshen, Shlomo. \\"Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco.\\" Middle Eastern Studies20, no. 4 (1984): 214 . doi:10.1080/00263208408700607. The Jewish quarters in Moroccan cities were called Mellahs. The Sultans also wanted the Jews to be protected for political reasons. An attack on minorities was seen as an attack on the Sultan's power. The Sultan put the Jews in the Mellah for their safety, as well as to protect the Sultan rulings from being tested by insurgents. The word mellah is similar to the Hebrew word for salt, (◊û◊ú◊ó). The term mellah refers to the salty, marshy area where the Jews of Northern Morocco were originally transferred and gathered.Lapidus, Ira M. \\"Emily Gottreich.The Mellah of Marrakesh: Jewish and Muslim Space in Moroccos Red City.:The Mellah of Marrakesh: Jewish and Muslim Space in Moroccos Red City.(Indiana Series in Middle East Studies.).\\" The American Historical Review113, no. 3 (2008): 946-47. doi:10.1086/ahr.113.3.946. The mellah was not a ghetto and was not structured in a way similar to Jewish quarters in Europe. By the 1900s, most Moroccan cities had a mellah. Culture Moroccan Jewry has developed as a hybrid of the many cultures that have shaped Morocco itself, namely Jewish, Arab, Berber, French and Spanish. =Music= Jewish Festival in Tetuan, Alfred Dehodencq, 1865, Paris Museum of Jewish Art and History Even before the arrival of Sephardi Jews to Morocco, Moroccan Jews performed and developed the traditions of the Andalusian classical music and introduced it into their Liturgical music. In his book \\"Jews of Andalusia and the Maghreb\\" on the musical traditions in Jewish societies of North Africa, Haim Zafrani writes: \\"In Spain and Morocco, Jews were ardent maintainers of Andalusian music and the zealous guardians of its old traditions ....\\" = Cuisine = One of the most famous dishes of Moroccan Jewish cuisine is the traditional sabbath meal: skhina (, a literal translation of \\"hot\\"), also called dfina ( \\"buried\\"). There's also a kosher version of pastilla. Mahia, an aperitivo distilled from dates or figs, is traditionally associated with Morocco's Jewish community. =Henna= Traditional Henna parties usually take place within the week before a special occasion, such as a wedding, Bar and Bat Mitzvah, or baby showers. During pre-wedding Henna parties, the Matriarch of the family (often the grandmother) smudges henna in the palm of the bride and groom to symbolically bestow the new couple with good health, fertility, wisdom, and security. The henna is believed in Moroccan tradition to protect the couple from demons. The grandmother covers the henna, a dough-like paste produced by mixing crushed henna plant leaves with water, in order to lock in body heat and generate a richer color. Normally, the henna will dye skin orange for up to two weeks. In Moroccan folklore, the bride is exempt of her household duties until the henna completely fades. After the bride and groom are blessed with the henna, the guests also spread henna on their palms to bring good luck. =Clothing= Although most Moroccan Jews tend to dress in styles of their adopted countries, traditional Moroccan clothing is sometimes worn during celebrations (Mimouna, weddings, Bar Mitzvas, etc.) or even during more intimate gatherings, such as Shabbat dinner. Men usually wear a white jellaba (jellabiya) cloak while women wear more ornate kaftans. =Mimouna= Mimouna is celebrated by many Moroccan Jews on the night following the last day of Passover. It has spread to be an almost national holiday in Israel where it is particularly prevalent in cities where there is a large concentration of Moroccan Jews like Ashdod, Ashkelon and Natanya. Religious observance Many Rabanim have passed through and sojourned in Morocco leaving behind great influence. In 2008, a project to preserve Moroccan Torah and the words of its ·∏§akhamim was initiated. DarkeAbotenou.com was created by a few members of the Toronto Sephardic Community; devoting their time and effort to increasing global awareness of the customs and laws that Jews of Morocco live with every day. Daily emails are sent in both English and French containing the customs, laws, and traditional liturgy of both the French and Spanish parts of Morocco. This daily publication is currently broadcast in both English and French.Dark√© Abotenou ¬ª About. Darkeabotenou.com (2008-11-21). Retrieved on 4 July 2011. =Liturgy= The observer of a typical Moroccan Jewish prayer service will note the presence of Oriental motifs in the melodies. However, unlike the tunes of Eastern rites (Syrian, Iraqi, etc.), which were influenced by Middle Eastern sounds, Moroccan Jewish religious tunes have a uniquely Andalusian feel. Furthermore, just as Eastern liturgical melodies are organized into Maqams, Moroccan liturgy can be classified by Noubas. The Moroccan prayer rite itself is also unique among Sephardic customs. The Moroccan nusach has many unique components but has also incorporated numerous Ashkenazic customs due to the country's proximity and exposure to Europe. Some customs of the Moroccan nusach include: * Two blessing for Hallel: One blessing (ligmor et ha'Hallel) is said when the full Hallel is recited, while the other blessing (likro et ha'Hallel) is said when the abridged Hallel is recited. Other Sephardim omit the latter. * Yiru Enenu: The blessing commencing with the words Yiru Enenu (translation: Our eyes shall see) is recited after Hashkivenu in the Arvit service after the Sabbath. Many Ashkenazim say this passage on every weekday night after Hashkivenu. This custom is discussed in Tosafot of Tractate Berakhot 4a. * Le'David: Before the Arvit service after the Sabbath, three psalms are recited in a unique tune said to be the same tune that King David's soldiers recited them in. The psalms are Chapters 144, 67 and 44 (in that order). Some congregations begin this service with Chapter 16 in a tune that leads up to the other three psalms. * Pesukei Dezimra: The opening verse of Psalm 30 (\\"Mizmor Shir ·∏§anukat Habayit LeDavid\\") is added to the remainder of the Psalm during Sha·∏•arit of Hanuka. Other Sepharadim begin with \\"Aromimkha\\" even on ·∏§anuka. * Shir HaShirim: This is usually read between Mincha and Kabbalat Shabbat on the Sabbath eve. Other Sephardic groups tend to read it before Min·∏•a. Moroccan Jews chant Shir HaShirim with a unique cantillation. A common practice is for a different congregant to sing each chapter. * Before the repetition of the Amidah in Sha·∏•arit and Musaf of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the hymn \\"Hashem sham'ati shim'akha yareti\\" (Translation: Hashem, I have heard your speech and was awed) is sung. The origin of this verse is Habakkuk 3:2. * The Moroccan tune for Torah Reading is unique to the Moroccan tradition, unlike all other Sephardic Jews who merely utilize different variations of the Yerushalmi tune. * Some of the Moroccan Piyutim / Jewish Prayer Melodies and Songs - are said to come from the songs of the Leviim / Levites - that were sung on the steps leading to the Beit HaMikdash / Holy Temple in Jerusalem. =Religious customs= * Psalm 29 and Lekha Dodi are recited sitting down in the Kabbalat Shabbat service. * Packets of salt are distributed to congregants on the second night of Passover, marking the first counting of the 'Omer. The significance of salt includes the commemoration of the sacrifices in the Temple and other Kabbalistic reasons.\\"Salt of Omer\\" in the Kehila Centre Website . (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-07-04. * Pirke Avot is read during the Musaf service of Shabbat between Passover and Shavuot. As well, the custom is for pre-Bar Mi·π£va boys to read each chapter, and this is usually performed with a special tune. * After reciting the hamotzie blessing over bread, there is a custom to dip the bread into salt while reciting \\"\\" (Translation: God reigns; God has reigned; God will reign for ever and ever). This \\"verse\\" is actually a compilation of three verses taken from Psalms and Exodus. The validity of this custom has been disputed among Moroccan Poskim since it may constitute an interruption of a blessing. * Before the Magid section of the Passover Seder, the Seder plate is raised and passed over the heads of those present while reciting \\"\\" (Translation: In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people). It can be heard here.. Retrieved on 4 July 2011.  Politics  Moroccan Jews have held important positions in the Makhzen throughout their history. Andr√© Azoulay currently serves as an advisor to Muhammad VI of Morocco. In the 20th century, there were a number of prominent Moroccan Jewish Communists including L√©on Sultan, Elie Azagury, Abraham Serfaty, and Sion Assidon. Genetics Over the years the Moroccan Jews' DNA was examined and studied by numerous studies, the general image of it showed that in terms of Y-DNA it was mainly from the same Levantine source as the vast majority of the world's Jewry, meaning that they too are descendants of the Ancient Hebrews/Israelites from the Biblical times. In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews), who are apparently closely related, the non-Jewish component is mainly southern European. Genetic research shows that about 27% of Moroccan Jews descend from one female ancestor. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of the Jewish populations of North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, Libya) was the subject of further detailed study in 2008 by Doron Behar et al. The analysis concludes that Jews from this region do not share the haplogroups of the mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (M1 and U6) that are typical of the North African Berber and Arab populations. Similarly, while the frequency of haplogroups L, associated with sub-Saharan Africa, are present in approximately 20‚Äì25% at the Berber populations studied, these haplogroups are only present in 1.3%, 2.7% and 3.6% respectively of Jews from Morocco, Tunisia and Libya. Behar et al. conclude that it is unlikely that North African Jews have significant Arab, or Berber admixture, \\"consistent with social restrictions imposed by religious restrictions,\\" or endogamy. This study also found genetic similarities between the Ashkenazi and North African Jews of European mitochondrial DNA pools, but differences between both of these of the diaspora and Jews from the Middle East.

The strength is determined by finding the smallest round sink into which the mainspring barrel (horology) will fit. (The diameter of the barrel is related to the mainspring length and strength, but this method for determining strength only works for springs of standard lengths.) Each manufacturer used a different arbitrary scale to describe mainspring sizes, but these sizes are usually based on the French inch. Figure 2: Martin mainspring slit gauge. Actual size 87 x 17 mm. A better method for measuring strength is to use a slit gauge, Figure 2, with which the thickness of the mainspring is measured directly.

Sudan has an embassy in London whilst the United Kingdom has an embassy in Khartoum. Most of the recent relations between the two countries centre on the region of Darfur.  History  Britain fought a war with Mahdist Sudan in the Mahdist War from 1881 until November 1899. Between 1899 and the country's independence in 1956, Sudan (then known as \\"Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\\") was an Anglo-Egyptian condominium. Although New Year‚Äôs Day 1956 marked Sudan‚Äôs independence, the British actually transferred power in 1954. Sudan set out almost immediately to broaden its relations with Arab and African states and then the Soviet Union, China, Eastern Europe, and Yugoslavia. Britain continued to provide considerable assistance, including military aid. As the civil war in the South grew in intensity, Sudan routinely blamed ‚Äúevil colonial policies‚Äù as one of the causes. Relations with Britain decreased in importance as those with the Middle East and Africa increased. Sudan broke relations with Britain in 1965 over Britain‚Äôs handling of the unilateral declaration of independence by Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Khartoum restored ties a year later but then severed them again in 1967 because of the Six-Day War between Israel and neighboring states. Relations resumed again a year later. Sudan alleged that Britain was linked to a failed coup attempt in 1976. By the late 1970s, the United States had replaced Britain as the predominant Western influence in Khartoum, a situation that continued until the overthrow of the Sadiq al-Mahdi government in 1989. Britain remained important for historical reasons and retained strong trade links. Together with the United States and Norway, Britain strongly supported the IGAD peace process that resulted in an end to conflict between Khartoum and the SPLM/A. British prime minister Tony Blair visited Khartoum in October 2004 but took a more critical position on Sudan‚Äôs policy in Darfur as the crisis dragged on. Of all EU members, the British position on Darfur was the closest to that of the United States. Following the outbreak of War in Darfur in 2003, in June 2004, British international development secretary, Hilary Benn, ruled out international military intervention for Darfur.Britain prefers monitors to military action to avert disaster in Sudan  World news  The Guardian However, by the next month, it was reported that British Prime Minister Tony Blair was asking officials to draw up plans for possible military intervention in Sudan.Blair draws up plans to send troops to Sudan  Politics  The Guardian In January 2006, Prime Minister Blair told the British Parliament that the international community was failing the people of Darfur in Sudan and that it was vital that the underfunded African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur be brought to full strength.RTHK Online News - Tony Blair says world failing Sudan In September 2006, Prime Minister Blair said he would propose an incentive package for Sudan as part of a new initiative to end the crisis in Darfur and get United Nations peacekeeping troops on the ground.Tony Blair to propose new Darfur initiative The Star Online 16 September 2006 In supporting the United Nations Security Council resolution in 2007 to authorize the deployment of up to 26,000 peacekeepers to try to stop the violence in Darfur, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, urged strong support for peacekeeping in Darfur, calling the war \\"the greatest humanitarian disaster the world faces today\\". He also called for an end to aerial bombing of civilians, and for greater effort to support peace talks and reconstruction and said:U.N.

Biography  Tamarkin was born in Chernigov, Imperial Russia (now Chernihiv, Ukraine) to a wealthy Jewish family. His father, David Tamarkin, was a physician and his mother, Sophie Krassilschikov, was from a family of a landowner. He moved to St. Petersburg as a child and grew up there. At a gymnasium, he befriended Alexander Friedmann, a future cosmologist, with whom he wrote his first mathematics paper in 1906, and remained friends and colleagues until Friedmann's sudden death in 1925. Vladimir Smirnov was his other friend from the same gymnasium. Many years later, they coauthored a popular textbook titled \\"A course in higher mathematics\\". Tamarkin studied in St. Petersburg University where he defended his dissertation in 1917. His advisor was Andrei Markov. After the graduation, Tamarkin worked at the Communication Institute and Electrotechnical Institute. In 1919 he temporarily became a professor and a dean at Perm State University, but a year later returned to St. Petersburg where he received a professorship at St. Petersburg Polytechnical University. In 1925 he became worried about Russia's stability and decided to emigrate to the United States. His favorite memory was the examination in analytic geometry he had to do with an American consul in Riga, when he tried to prove his identity.See E. Hille, p. 443. In the U.S., he became a lecturer at Dartmouth College. In 1927, Tamarkin received a professorship at Brown University where he remained until his retirement in 1945, after suffering a heart attack. He died later that year in Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C.See Encyclopedia Brunoniana article. Tamarkin's work spanned a number of areas, including number theory, integral equations, Fourier series, complex analysis, moment problem, boundary value problem and differential equations. He was a proponent and a founding co-editor of the Mathematical Reviews (which was based at Brown at that time), together with Otto Neugebauer and William Feller.The Editors of Mathematical Reviews, from the AMS website. He was also an active supporter of the American Mathematical Society, a member of the council starting 1931, and a vice- president in 1942‚Äì43. He had over twenty doctoral students at Brown, including Dorothy Lewis Bernstein, Nelson Dunford, George Forsythe, Margaret Gurney and Derrick Lehmer. Tamarkin was married to Helene Weichardt (1888‚Äì1934) who came from a wealthy family of German ancestry. Their son, Paul Tamarkin (1922‚Äì1977), was a physicist for RAND Corporation.German-Russian von L√∂hr Family  Notes  References  * Jacob David Tamarkin‚ÄîHis life and work, by Einar Hille, Bull.

It was directed by series producer Don Scardino, and written by show producers Jack Burditt and Robert Carlock. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on May 14, 2009. Guest stars in this episode include Alan Alda, Kay Cannon, Donald Glover, Napiera Groves, Chris Parnell, Paula Pell, and Sherri Shepherd. In addition, \\"Kidney Now!\\" featured many musical guest stars including Clay Aiken, Elvis Costello, Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow, the Beastie Boys (Mike D and Ad Rock), Steve Earle, Adam Levine, Sara Bareilles, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Talib Kweli, Michael McDonald, Rhett Miller, Moby, Robert Randolph, Rachael Yamagata and Cyndi Lauper, all as themselves. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) gets to know his newly discovered father, Milton Greene (Alda), but quickly learns that Milton needs a kidney transplant, and discovers he is not a suitable donor. As a result, Jack decides to use the liberal media to find an alternate way to get him a kidney donor. Meanwhile, people seek Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) out as a relationship expert as a result of her \\"Dealbreaker\\" sketches, and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) helps Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) deal with his embarrassment over not finishing high school. The song \\"He Needs a Kidney\\" was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. The concept of doing a charity concert was based on Robert Carlock and series creator Tina Fey wanting to include a musical performance in the episode with the Milton Greene character in need of a kidney donor. Carlock and Fey wanted \\"He Needs a Kidney\\" to be similar to the 1985 charity song, \\"We Are the World\\". Following the airing of this 30 Rock episode, NBC released the musical performance video of \\"He Needs a Kidney\\" on iTunes with all proceeds from the sales going to the National Kidney Foundation. \\"Kidney Now!\\" was generally well received among television critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode was watched by 5.7 million viewers. Jack Burditt and Robert Carlock were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for their work in this episode. In addition, Tony Pipitone and Griffin Richardson received a Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (half-hour) and Animation. Plot Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) gets to know his newly discovered father, Milton Greene (Alan Alda) but soon discovers Milton has a serious medical condition and is in search of a kidney donor. After discovering he is an unsuitable donor by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell), Jack uses his contacts‚Äîmusicians Clay Aiken, Sara Bareilles, the Beastie Boys (Mike D and Ad-Rock), Mary J. Blige, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Talib Kweli, Cyndi Lauper, Adam Levine, Michael McDonald, Rhett Miller, Moby, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata‚Äîto arrange a charity benefit entitled \\"Kidney Now!\\" in attempt to find a donor for Milton. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) gains notoriety after making an appearance on The Vontella Show, along with Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), as a relationship expert after her \\"Dealbreaker\\" sketches on the fictitious comedy sketch show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). As a result of the success she received as the relationship expert on The Vontella Show, Liz becomes more well known and begins dispensing relationship advice to the female staff of TGS, and to Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) and Paula Hornberger (Paula Pell), the wives of TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), respectively. Though, Tracy and Pete are upset with the advice Liz gave to their wives, Liz blows them off and goes to Quizno's to meet with an agent to write a prospective Dealbreaker book. The deal goes through and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) tells Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) that she is \\"getting [hers].\\" At the same time, Tracy is invited to speak at the graduation ceremony of his former high school (named after Frank Lucas, the infamous Harlem drug lord). NBC page and friend Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) tries to help him overcome troubling memories from his high school experience. Kenneth persuades Tracy to go to the graduation, which he does, where Tracy gives his speech and receives an honorary diploma. Production \\"Kidney Now!\\" was directed by series producer Don Scardino, and written by 30 Rock producers Jack Burditt and Robert Carlock. This was Burditt and Carlock's fourth script collaboration, having penned the episodes \\"Cleveland\\", \\"Subway Hero\\", and \\"Sandwich Day\\". This was Scardino's twenty-first directed episode. \\"Kidney Now!\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 14, 2009, as the twenty-second episode and season finale of the show's third season and the 58th overall episode of the series. \\"He Needs a Kidney\\" was written and arranged by 30 Rock composer Jeff Richmond (pictured). \\"Kidney Now!\\" was first read by its cast on March 5, 2009; it was filmed on March 16‚Äì17, 2009. Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken \\"He Needs a Kidney\\", the charity song featured in this episode, was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. Richmond is married to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. In discussion of the development of \\"Kidney Now!\\", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey \\"were trying to figure out a way to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're going to deal with that\\", and that the two came to the decision to \\"take advantage of the singing\\", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, \\"We Are the World\\", as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. \\"Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they want to get a kidney. I think we had angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'\\", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph. Giancarlo Vulcano, a music editor and associate arranger on the show, revealed that Richmond taught him the song one morning at Silvercup Studios‚Äîwhere the show is filmed‚Äîand they played the first half of \\"He Needs a Kidney\\" at the script's read-through. According to Vulcano, the 30 Rock staff loved the song and the two were satisfied with the reception of it. While arranging the instrumentation, Richmond hired violinists for the episode's background music and for \\"He Needs a Kidney\\", which according to him he usually does not get the opportunity to have a lot of violin sounds on the show. The recording sessions with the musical guests took place on Stage 1 at Silvercup Studios; Stage 1 serves as the set for TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictitious comedy sketch show featured on 30 Rock. Richmond and Vulcano were complimentary towards the musicians‚ÄîClay Aiken, Sara Bareilles, the Beastie Boys (Mike D and Ad-Rock), Mary J. Blige, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Talib Kweli, Cyndi Lauper, Adam Levine, Michael McDonald, Rhett Miller, Moby, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata‚Äîwho performed \\"He Needs a Kidney\\". In the DVD commentary for this episode, Richmond believed that the entire song would not make it into the airing. Elvis Costello was once approached to do an appearance on 30 Rock, but the appearance fell- through. At an Oscar's after party, Fey ran into Costello and asked him if he could appear, which he agreed to. According to Fey, none of the music artists got paid to appear on the show as \\"they all did [it] for free.\\" The reason for this was due to a joke in the song in which Sheryl Crow was the only individual to get paid, as the rest said they did it for free. Following the broadcast of this episode of 30 Rock, the musical performance video was made available for digital download on iTunes with all the proceeds from the sales going to the National Kidney Foundation. During the song's performance, it was revealed that singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow (pictured) was the only performer to get paid, although in real-life none of the singers who performed \\"He Needs a Kidney\\" got paid. According to Fey, there were discussions on whether or not to use a real talk show host from New York, for the \\"Dealbreakers\\" segment, but ultimately decided to make one up and went with actress Napiera Groves who plays talk show host Vontella in \\"Kidney Now!\\". The Tracy character plot was based on Tracy Morgan who in real-life was given a diploma by his former high school, DeWitt Clinton High School. Like the Tracy character, who dropped out of high school after being asked to dissect a frog, Morgan dropped out of DeWitt Clinton when his father became ill. Jack and Liz's scene, along with Tracy and Kenneth's, at the end where they watch the charity concert, was filmed the day before the musical number took place. \\"They were pretending to look at the singing\\", revealed Fey. They forced that shot in so that the episode not just end with the performance. Professor Milton Greene was played by guest actor Alan Alda, best known for his role as Hawkeye Pierce from the television series M*A*S*H. This was Alda's second appearance, having appeared in the previous episode \\"Mamma Mia\\". In a scene of \\"Kidney Now!\\", Tracy breaks down crying and says \\"There is no baby. I was chicken! I was chicken!\\" then Milton, who sees this, asks \\"A guy crying about a chicken and a baby? I thought this was a comedy show.\\" This was a reference to Alda's M*A*S*H character in the series finale episode in which Hawkeye breaks down after realizing he had seen a woman smother her baby to death, not a chicken as Hawkeye had originally recalled in his repressed mind. Comedian actor Chris Parnell, who played Dr. Leo Spaceman in the season finale, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. Comedian actress Sherri Shepherd reprised her role as Angie Jordan, the wife of Tracy, for the fifth time. Paula Pell made her second guest spot as the character Paula Hornberger, the wife of Pete Hornberger, played by Scott Adsit. In \\"Kidney Now!\\", Angie and Paula ask Liz for relationship advice. In addition, 30 Rock writers Jack Burditt, Kay Cannon, and Donald Glover appear in the episode; Burditt and Cannon appear in The Vontella Show segment as members from the audience who ask Liz questions. When Tracy accepts an honorary diploma from his former high school, in his speech, Tracy outs Glover's character. The success of the benefit concert for Milton is not explicitly referenced until Alda's character alludes to it in the season five episode \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\", though in the season four episode \\"Into the Crevasse\\", Milton is shown to have finished his book entitled From Peanut to President, a biography of U.S. President Jimmy Carter. One filmed scene from \\"Kidney Now!\\" was cut out from the airing. Instead, the scene was featured on 30 Rock‚Äôs season three DVD as part of the deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, Liz enters the TGS writer's room, and tells the writing staff that she got recognized from her appearance on The Vontella Show as the relationship expert from \\"Dealbreakers\\". Pete cannot believe that Liz gave actual relationship advice on the program, citing Liz's own past relationship faults. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"Kidney Now!\\" was watched by 5.7 million viewers during its original United States broadcast. The rating was an 8 percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"Mamma Mia\\", which was seen by 6.2 million American viewers. The show claimed a 2.8 rating/7 share among viewers aged 18 to 49, meaning that 2.8 percent of all people in that group, and 7 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. Jack Burditt and Robert Carlock received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for their work on \\"Kidney Now!\\", but they lost it to fellow 30 Rock writer Matt Hubbard for the episode \\"Reunion\\" at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. At the same awards show, Tony Pipitone and Griffin Richardson were nominated for a Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (half-hour) and Animation. IGN contributor Robert Canning wrote that the ending from this episode \\"did have a season finale feel to it with the big musical number. [...] Still, it was a great season, and I loved going out with two of the best characters on TV summing up the moment perfectly ‚Äì Liz: 'We sure had quite a year.' Jack: 'What are you talking about? It's May.'\\" Canning gave it an 8.5 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote that the \\"all-star cast of musicians\\" featured were not able to dominate the episode \\"to the point where the episode didn't work.\\" Sepinwall, however, added that despite \\"Kidney Now!\\" not being a classic 30 Rock episode \\"it was [still] funny enough ‚Äì which, I suppose, also makes it an appropriate finale for this uneven season.\\" Further in the review, Sepinwall was complimentary towards Liz's plot, writing that the character's sequence on The Vontella Show was \\"hilarious, and a fine demonstration of how much confidence Tina Fey has gained as an actress over the years.\\" The A.V. Club‚Äôs Nathan Rabin also enjoyed the Liz character, reporting that she \\"delivered a virtuoso performance in [The Vontella Show], instantly homing in on the fatal flaw in every relationship and obliterating it with highly quotable sass.\\" In discussion to Tracy's plot, Rabin opined it was the \\"weakest of the various threads\\" in this episode. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad confessed in his recap that he was going to summarize \\"Kidney Now!\\" as \\"a little disappointing, but then I hit rewind on my DVR and watched it again and realized, wow, they actually hit all of the season finale notes rather perfectly [...] This episode was quite funny.\\" Rick Porter of Zap2it worried how the series would fit in \\"the likes\\" of Elvis Costello, Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken and Adam Levine \\"without it overwhelming the episode\\", and reported that the answer to that \\"turned out to be 'very effectively.'\\" In regards to the storylines, itself, he noted that Jack's quest in getting Milton a kidney \\"balanced nicely\\" with Liz's story, and that Tracy's \\"had some good moments\\". In conclusion, Porter wrote \\"For a show that doesn't always know how to end episodes, it's done really well at ending seasons.\\" TV Guide Magazine‚Äôs Sandra Kofler wrote that the \\"He Needs a Kidney\\" song was hilarious, and that it \\"stole [30 Rock's] season finale.\\" Patrick Goldstein, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was favorable to the musical number, reporting \\"[t]he song itself is a hoot, highlighted by a wonderful spoken-word kidney donation pitch that begins with Costello saying: 'Listen, when someone starts talking in the middle of a song, you know it's serious.'\\" Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett said \\"Kidney Now!\\" was \\"sweet and all\\", and noted that the \\"Vontella-as-Tyra spoof\\" was \\"brilliant.\\" Time contributor James Poniewozik wrote that this episode \\"was a fitting end for a guest-star-heavy ... season of 30 Rock\\", but added that the finale overall was \\"maybe average\\", however, \\"the ending at least delivered the goods, with the best sitcom celebrity benefit song\\".

He was the first to prove that e, the base of natural logarithms, is a transcendental number. His methods were used later by Ferdinand von Lindemann to prove that œÄ is transcendental. In a letter to Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, Hermite remarked, \\"I turn with terror and horror from this lamentable scourge of continuous functions with no derivatives.\\" The Hermite crater near the Moon's north pole is named in his honor. Life Hermite was born in Dieuze, Moselle, on 24 December 1822, with a deformity in his right foot that would impair his gait throughout his life. He was the sixth of seven children of Ferdinand Hermite and his wife, Madeleine n√©e Lallemand. Ferdinand worked in the drapery business of Madeleine's family while also pursuing a career as an artist. The drapery business relocated to Nancy in 1828, and so did the family. Charles Hermite circa 1887 Hermite obtained his secondary education at Coll√®ge de Nancy and then, in Paris, at Coll√®ge Henri IV and at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. He read some of Joseph-Louis Lagrange's writings on the solution of numerical equations and Carl Friedrich Gauss's publications on number theory. Hermite wanted to take his higher education at √âcole Polytechnique, a military academy renowned for excellence in mathematics, science, and engineering. Tutored by mathematician Eug√®ne Charles Catalan, Hermite devoted a year to preparing for the notoriously difficult entrance examination. In 1842 he was admitted to the school. However, after one year the school would not allow Hermite to continue his studies there because of his deformed foot. He struggled to regain his admission to the school, but the administration imposed strict conditions. Hermite did not accept this, and he quit the √âcole Polytechnique without graduating. In 1842, Nouvelles Annales de Math√©matiques published Hermite's first original contribution to mathematics, a simple proof of Niels Abel's proposition of concerning the impossibility of an algebraic solution to equations of the fifth degree. A correspondence with Carl Jacobi, begun in 1843 and continued the next year, resulted in the insertion, in the complete edition of Jacobi's works, of two articles by Hermite, one concerning the extension to Abelian functions of one of the theorems of Abel on elliptic functions, and the other concerning the transformation of elliptic functions. After spending five years working privately towards his degree, in which he befriended eminent mathematicians Joseph Bertrand, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and Joseph Liouville, he took and passed the examinations for the baccalaur√©at, which he was awarded in 1847. He married Joseph Bertrand's sister, Louise Bertrand, in 1848. In 1848, Hermite returned to the √âcole Polytechnique as r√©p√©titeur and examinateur d'admission. In 1856 he contracted smallpox. Through the influence of Augustin-Louis Cauchy and of a nun who nursed him, he resumed the practice of his Catholic faith. In July 1848, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. In 1869, he succeeded Jean- Marie Duhamel as professor of mathematics, both at the √âcole Polytechnique, where he remained until 1876, and at the University of Paris, where he remained until his death. From 1862 to 1873 he was lecturer at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. Upon his 70th birthday, he was promoted to grand officer in the French Legion of Honour. Hermite died in Paris on 14 January 1901, aged 78. Contribution to mathematics An inspiring teacher, Hermite strove to cultivate admiration for simple beauty and discourage rigorous minutiae. His correspondence with Thomas Stieltjes testifies to the great aid he gave those beginning scientific life. His published courses of lectures have exercised a great influence. His important original contributions to pure mathematics, published in the major mathematical journals of the world, dealt chiefly with Abelian and elliptic functions and the theory of numbers. During 1858 he solved the equation of the fifth degree by elliptic functions; and during 1873 he proved e, the base of the natural system of logarithms, to be transcendental. This last was used by Ferdinand von Lindemann to prove during 1882 the same for œÄ.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1935 to 1940. Ash served as a member of the Governing Social Credit caucus, and later as an Independent Social Credit member while representing the electoral district of Olds. Political career Ash ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1935 Alberta general election. He won the electoral district of Olds as a candidate for the Social Credit party. Ash won a huge majority taking 66% of the vote defeating three other candidates including incumbent Agriculture Minister Frank Grisdale. In 1937, Ash was one of the insurgents in the Social Credit backbenchers' revolt. Ash was removed from the Social Credit caucus citing a difference of opinion with Premier William Aberhart in 1940. The Social Credit Candidate Advisory Board refused to let him run for the party. He was dropped as a candidate by the Social Credit advisory board. Ash decided to stand for re-election anyway as an Independent Social Credit candidate. Ash faced off in a three-way battle with Grisdale, who this time ran as an Independent and Social Credit candidate Norman Cook. The first vote showed Ash easily defeated running a distant third place. Grisdale was leading 110 votes ahead of Cook. Grisdale did not have a 50% majority so the Ash's second preferences were counted. Most of the second choices game Cook just enough votes to win the district and defeat Grisdale.

The film, set against the backdrop of global terrorism, features Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Kirron Kher, Om Puri and Dia Mirza in starring roles. Released on 20 November 2009, the film deals with an underground organization's attempt at instilling fear by means of terrorism in the United States. It also intersperses philosophical arguments over the corruption of religious beliefs in an attempt to rectify the damage to non-involved Muslims the world-over. Plot Avantika Ahuja (Kareena Kapoor), an academic living in the United States, returns to Delhi after her father falls ill. While in India she meets Ehsaan Khan (Saif Ali Khan), a University professor from Mumbai; and the two become friends and soon fall in love. After some time, Avantika must return to work. Ehsaan readily agrees to emigrate for her, and the couple are soon married and living in America. Avantika helps Ehsaan in getting a job, and he is appointed as a professor to teach 'Islam and the Modern World' at the same university where she works. The pair live a happy life in a quiet suburb populated by many South Asian families. Salma (Nauheed Cyrusi), Avantika's neighbour, is effectively being confined in her own home by her husband Hakil. She manages to inform Avantika about the situation and requests her to contact Rehana (Dia Mirza), a friend and TV reporter. Avantika meets with Rehana and her boyfriend Riyaz (Vivek Oberoi), a Muslim American war journalist who has just arrived from Iraq. Together they discuss Salma's problem and the trio conclude that Salma is probably the victim of domestic violence. Rehana plans a meeting with Salma, but is unable to meet her since she is leaving to Iraq, as part of a United Nations envoy. Avantika is overjoyed to learn that she is pregnant. While waiting for Ehsaan, she takes a walk around her street. Overhearing voices, she decides to investigate and finds out that a group of men from her neighborhood, lead by the elder Bhaijaan (Om Puri), are planning a mission. They aim to bomb the plane that Rehana is travelling in, since it is carrying a large group of diplomats and media personnel. Avantika realises that they are part of a terrorist group and also comes across Salma's dead body. The men see her and chase her to her house, where she meets Ehsaan. At first he consoles her, but soon reveals that he is also a part of the terrorist group. Avantika realizes that she is nothing but a pawn in Ehsaan‚Äôs game - he married her to legitimately obtain residency in the United States. Bhaijaan asks Ehsaan to kill Avantika since she is now a liability, but after learning that she is pregnant, Ehsaan decides not to. Ehsaan keeps Avantika captive in their home and threatens to kill her father in India if she tries to inform anyone of what she knows. Avantika manages to make a phone call, and calls Rehana in order to warn her. The call goes to voice mail and it is too late, Rehana has already boarded the flight and the bomb has already been planted. The plane explodes, killing Rehana and all others on board. A heartbroken Riyaz finds Avantika's voice message for Rehana, and begins his own quest to uncover the real culprits behind the flight bombing. Going undercover, Riyaz joins Ehsaan's lectures and soon befriends him. Avantika and the other wives of the group are watched over by Aapa (Kirron Kher), Bhaijaan's wife. Aapa explains the reasons for Jihad to Avantika, and also reveals that Ehsaan was a Pakistani man with no political ideology, until his first wife and son were killed by American bombs. Riyaz engages in a passionate debate with other students regarding the topic of Islam, and Ehsaan is impressed. While trying to dispose of Salma's decomposing body, Hakil and Ehsaan attract the attention of police. Ehsaan kills Hakil and the surrounding policemen, and sets the car on fire. Salma's partially burnt body is found, and the FBI distributes pictures of her in order to learn her identity. Ehsaan finds Riyaz to be a perfect replacement for Hakil. Ehsaan introduces Riyaz to Bhaijaan, who is initially suspicious of the new recruit. He tests Riyaz by ordering him to shoot at a random man serving at a fast food counter. Riyaz is reluctant but follows through, however it turns out there was no bullet in the gun thus leaving the man unharmed. Having passed the test, Ehsaan makes Riyaz a part of their next mission to bomb several subway stations in New York. Riyaz and Avantika begin to work together to foil the plan and bring down the terrorist group. Riyaz sets up a meeting with the FBI for the next day but his plan is derailed when one of the men sees Salma's picture, and Bhaijaan decides to bring the date of the mission forward. The group go ahead with their plan - the women travel together with Aapa and the men have three bombs between them, to be detonated at separate stations. While on the subway, Riyaz's colleague bumps into him and accidentally reveals his real identity to Ehsaan and Bhaijaan. Riyaz tries to escape and, in the chaos, shoots Bhaijaan. Before dying, Bhaijaan informs Ehsaan that there are three more bombs, which were placed in the bags of the women, unknown to them. One bomb is with Avantika, who is being escorted by Aapa. Realising that both Avantika and his unborn child will die, Ehsaan decides to let Riyaz go, and sets out to find Avantika. Riyaz informs the FBI of the situation and they rush to each station, trying to find both the men and women. They are able to safely retrieve the explosives from the women, while the men detonate their bombs. Ehsaan kills Aapa in order to free Avantika, and he admits that he loves her and asks her to take care of their child. Ehsaan manages to disarm the last bomb, but is fatally wounded as he escapes from three policemen who were chasing him. Before leaving, Avantika asks Ehsaan what his real name is, which he reveals to be Khalid. As she leaves the train, she hears the gunshot of Ehsaan killing himself.

It is known for its BMP series of infantry fighting vehicles.  Overview  The company's main products are the well-known BMP-2 and BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles, which are in service in 29 countries. The company also produces a wide range of civil products, such as small-sized tractors, municipal construction machines and automobile trailers, among others. Kurganmashzavod JSC is the largest enterprise in the Kurgan Oblast. It is a large engineering complex, comprising 3 factories, 6 special plants and auxiliary workshops ensuring the complete production cycle. It is involved in developing technology, testing equipment and experimental development, pilot production and full-scale production of armoured vehicles. The company's stock is traded at the Russian trading system. The director general of Kurganmashzavod until 2005 was Valery D. Dorodny. The current director general is Pyotr Aleksandrovich Tyukov. In 2007 the company's revenue was $231 million. Export share was 20%.  History  Indian Army BMP-2 The company was founded as a producer of heavy-duty cranes. In 1954 the manufacture of military equipment was started with the ATS and ATS-59 artillery tractors, which were used for field work and reclaiming of oilfield in Tyumen region, in addition to many produced for export. The ATS-59 artillery tractor licence production was established in Poland. In October 1966, the production plan of the infantry fighting vehicle BMP-1 was prescribed by the government bylaw. In 1967, the mass production of vehicles began. In the seventies, the plant was re-tooled for larger-scale military vehicle production. New power supplies were brought in, and the working area was increased by a factor of five. From 1983, the plant produced the BMP-2 model, and in 1987 began the manufacture of the BMP-3. In 2008, the company said that it was pursuing a production processes optimization programme to make the operations more efficient. In the future the company aims to produce \\"hundreds of vehicles a year, rather than dozens of vehicles per annum\\", both for the Russian Army and for export. Kurganmashzavod has received a large state contract worth $250 million for building and repairing an unspecified number of BMP-3 vehicles between 20072010. The company plans on investing about $40 million to re-equip its facilities. In late December 2015, the company was reportedly \\"balancing on the brink of full stoppage\\" of its AFV production because of an outstanding natural gas bill of 55.5 million rubles (approximately US$764,000) to Gazprom Mezhregiongaz.

Ivar Mortensson-Egnund (originally Ivar Julius Mortensen and also referred to as Ivar Matlaus) (24 July 1857 ‚Äì 16 February 1934) was a Norwegian author, journalist, theologian, researcher, translator, writer, philosopher and advocate of nynorsk (the new Norwegian language). He was born in Alvdal North √òsterdal. His parents were Anne Petronelle Tangen, and Morten Mortensen Ogarden, a former parliament member for the Liberals, both from Tynset. He studied theology in Christiania and was cand. theol. in 1883. However, he did not practice as a priest before he became a diocese curate at Hamar in 1909. In 1894 he married Karen Nilsen and they farmed at Einabu in Folldal, a farm which his family had purchased in 1873. Childhood Ivar Mortensson grew up in a religiously Haugianistic and politically liberal home. He completed the examen artium at Aars og Voss\` school in Christiania in 1875 and the cand. theol. in 1883. Poet and supporter for Nynorsk Ivar Mortensson-Egnund's home Einabu. Mortensson- Egnund dedicated his life to the reconstruction of the Norwegian written language, working to free it from the Danish chancery language. Around the turn of the century he became a strong opponent of the riksm√•l supporter Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. In the 1870s, he was a friend and acquaintance of Moltke Moe, and through him met Arne Garborg. In 1877 when Garborg started the magazine \\"Fedraheimen\\" Mortensson became an employee. It was also Ivar who helped Hulda and Arne Garborg locate & rent a small cabin on the small farm \\"Kolbotnen\\", near the lake Savalen in Alvdal in 1887. When Garborg moved there, Mortensson followed. At this time these friends had little money and Garborg styled Mortenssonn as ‚ÄúIvar Matlaus‚Äù (Ivar Foodless). Mortensson- Egnund was also a poet, and in 1889 he published \\"Paa ymse gjerdom\\", followed by \\"Or duldo\\" in 1895. Later, he was best known for his setting the Draumkvedet (1905) and the Poetic Edda (1908) into modern Norwegian. Ivar Mortensson-Egnund is often mentioned as a sponsor of and influence on Olav Aukrust. After Aukrust had finished his three years of teacher‚Äôs education in Elverum in 1906 and moved to Folldal as a teacher, where he lived at Einabu the two years he was there. Helge Groth wrote \\"Of all the Norwegian poets and authors, none more directly influenced Olav Aukrust than Ivar Mortensson- Egnund.\\" Mortensson-Egnund had built a poet‚Äôs retreat on the top of the ridge in the direction of Egnund chapel, sitting on the ridge of an esker--a trace from the last ice age. Mortensson-Egnund worked there in the daytime during the summer, but used his farm Einabu for meals and lodging. He lived at the Einabu farm with the poet‚Äôs retreat up along Norwegian Highway 29, near the Einunna river bridge, for much of his life. The main building from the 1870s stands still as it did in his time. Along the road there is a bust of Ivar Mortensson-Egnund carved by Trygve Dammen bust; it was unveiled on the 100-anniversary of his birth in 1957. The North √òsterdal museum includes a display covering his history. Revolutionary The front page of Fedraheimen, June 28. 1884. From 1888 on Fedraheimen was edited from this log cabin, now in Tynset Bygdemuseum. Mortensson-Egnund was a powerful and intense revolutionary. He was arrested in 1881 when he led a rebellion in Skien in support of Johan Sverdrup,Sverdrup tried from his earliest days in the Storting to form a radical party consisting of the large group of peasants and the radical elements among the representatives from the cities parliamentary reform and Nynorsk. He attempted to unify nationalism, anarchism, mysticism and religion in his poetry and his work. In 1883 Mortensson-Egnund became editor of the paper Fedraheimen, and served until 1889. Under Mortensson leadership the newspaper embraced the war against \\"the moneyed, ministers of state and imperialism\\". Mortensson called the magazine a \\"communist-anarchist organ for the country\\" and published extensive material from the international anarchist movement. In 1888 Mortensson supported Garborg as Storting representative for Hedmark; the campaign was unsuccessful. The following year he held a 17 May independence celebration in Tynset, where he argued against cowardliness of the members of the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly, but praised the French Revolution. He concluded by singing La Marseillaise for shocked farmers. He and Garborg resigned from the Liberals and formed a workers party for Tynset and R√∏ros. Fedraheimen ceased publication in 1891, two years after Mortensson-Egnund resigned as editor; his successor was Rasmus Steinsvik. Mortensson-Egnund published the anarchist magazine Fridom (freedom) from 1896 to 1899, and corresponded with the well-known Russian anarchist Pjotr Kropotkin, whose concept of voluntary cooperation influenced him greatly. At this time Mortensson-Egnund developed a theory that the Norwegian farmers in prehistoric times had lived in anarchic groups that he called samn√∏yter. Priest In 1909 Mortensson-Egnund was diocese curate in Hamar, and he was ordained as a priest in Norway the following year. Beginning in 1919 he was involved in translating the Bible into landsm√•l. He received a Government stipend from 1929 forward.

He played college lacrosse as an undergraduate at New York University and served as the team captain. Miller later played with the amateur organizations, the Staten Island Athletic Club and the Crescent Athletic Club. He also coached the Columbia University team for several years.  Education  He was born November 2, 1866 Bronx Historian, The New Yorker, March 28, 1953. in Claverack, New York, the son of attorney Jacob F. Miller, a Williams College graduate. He attended college at New York University (NYU), where he played lacrosse and served as the team captain. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1888. After graduating college, he played with the Staten Island Athletic Club and captained the lacrosse team to the 1890 championship. He then attended law school at Columbia University, where he graduated cum laude in 1891.Cyrus C. Miller , National Lacrosse Hall of Fame, US Lacrosse, 2005.  Lacrosse  Staten Island participated in the 1892 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) tournament with the Lorillard, Manhattan, and New York clubs. There were allegations of professionalism and the importation of ineligible Canadian ringers by those three teams, and Staten Island played only under protest. Miller was critical of the New York club in particular:Donald M. Fisher, Lacrosse: A History of the Game, p. 69‚Äì70, 2002, Baltimore: JHU Press, . > When a club deliberately imports six or eight of the best players in Canada, > feeds them like fighting cocks, keeps them with nothing to do from one > week's end to another but play lacrosse, and then plays them against a team > composed of business men who don't get a chance to practice more than three > or four hours a week, I think it's about time to stop it ... Although we are > not afraid to take a beating from a Canadian team as such, we don't care to > be beaten by Canadians and have a New York club get the credit of it. He played for the Crescent Athletic Club from 1895 to 1912. In 1897, Miller accompanied the Crescent team on a tour of England with each player paying his own way as a testament to their club's principle of amateurism. After an abbreviated domestic season, the team left for England in March. There, they compiled a record of 7‚Äì5‚Äì2 against British clubs.Fisher, p. 77‚Äì78. Miller served as the head coach for the Columbia lacrosse team for several years. In 1900, The New York Times erroneously reported that he had received a payment of $150 for his services as coach, which he denied in a letter to the editor. He stated \\"I have been somewhat strenuous in advocating the principles of pure amateur sport, I prefer not to remain under the stigma of receiving money for athletics.\\" The confusion arose due to Miller advising the team to hire a professional coach, as he no longer had enough free time to devote to the task. The manager requisitioned $150 to hire a replacement coach, but the athletics department denied it due to a lack of funds.COLUMBIA LACROSSE.; Mr. C.C. Miller Received No Pay as a Coach, as Stated, The New York Times, May 15, 1900. He served as the president of the Professional Lacrosse Association, and from 1900 to 1902, as the president of the Inter-University Lacrosse League.Fisher, p. 100. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) came into being on December 22, 1905 through Miller's proposal. He recommended the combination of the Inter-university Lacrosse League and the Intercollegiate Association, which at the time, played under slightly different rules.David G. Pietramala et al., Lacrosse: Technique and Tradition, p. 11, 2006, Baltimore: JHU Press, . In the USILA, Miller served on the Executive Committee. Miller was hopeful for the future of the sport and described it as follows:Fisher, p. 100‚Äì101. > When the United States and Canada are unified, Lacrosse may well claim to be > the national game of the Union; for long before the earliest white pioneers > and voyageurs in North America, the game of baggataway, which afterwards > became lacrosse, was played by the Indian tribes in widely scattered parts > of the northern continent of America ... With the elimination of old methods > of play, the white man has introduced team play and science into the game, > so that now it is recognized that no team of individual players, no matter > how skilful [sic], can beat a team of merely good players who have fine team > organization.  Professional life  Miller was an attorney by trade and worked for most of his life at the law firm started by his father. From 1910 to 1914, Miller served as the Bronx's third Borough President. In 1912 Borough President Miler proposed the creation of terminal markets in New York City, including the seeds of the original Bronx Terminal Market. In his New York Times obituary, it is noted that Miller was considered as \\"the father of the Bronx Terminal Market\\". He served on the Real Estate Board which handled the expansion of the New York City Subway system, and in 1917, was named to the New York State and the United States Food Administration Boards. He also was a trustee of NYU. Miller was appointed as the first official Bronx Borough Historian in 1944, and continued that appointment until 1953. He died on January 21, 1956 and is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The The Bronx, New York City. US Lacrosse inducted him into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1957.

Originally trained as a paediatrician, he served as the inaugural Chief Science Advisor to the New Zealand Prime Minister from 2009 to 2018. He is a founding member and current Chair of the International Network for Government Science Advice, and is President-elect of the International Science Council. Scientific career Born in Auckland, Gluckman attended Auckland Grammar School before studying paediatrics and endocrinology at the University of Otago, gaining an MBChB in 1971 and an MMedSc in 1976 from the University of Auckland. After further training at the University of California, San Francisco, he returned to New Zealand in 1980 to establish a group in perinatal physiology as a career fellow of the Medical Research Council of New Zealand. In 1988, Gluckman was appointed Professor of Paediatric and Perinatal Biology and was Head of the Department of Paediatrics. He obtained a DSc in 1989 from the University of Auckland. He then served as Dean of the university's Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences whilst also heading the Research Centre for Developmental Medicine and Biology. In 2001, Gluckman became the founding Director of the Liggins Institute, and, a year later, Director of the National Research Centre for Growth and Development (now called 'Gravida: National Centre for Growth and Development'), hosted by the University of Auckland. He stepped down from both positions in mid-2009 to assume his role as the first Chief Science Advisor to the New Zealand Prime Minister. In 2007 Gluckman was appointed Programme Director for Growth, Development and Metabolism at the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, where he is currently Chief Scientific Officer. He also holds honorary chairs at National University of Singapore and the University of Southampton. In 2014, he was appointed co-chair of the World Health Organization Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (ECHO). Gluckman has made research contributions to the fields of perinatal physiology and biology, developmental neuroscience and neuroprotection, paediatric and experimental endocrinology, as well as at the interface between ecological, developmental and evolutionary biology as applied to human health. He is the only New Zealander elected to the Institute of Medicine of the United States National Academies of Science, and is a Fellow of Academy of Medical Sciences of Great Britain.  Contributions to science advice and diplomacy  In June 2009 Gluckman was appointed as the first Chief Science Advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand. This appointment was extended twice to end in June 2018. During this time, Gluckman made national and international contributions to science advice, science policy, and science diplomacy. He established departmental science advisory roles in major departments, and this group has been increasingly used by Government as a formal process of advice on matters relating to evidence and policy. He was given the additional appointment of Special Science Envoy for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2010 to assist his role in science diplomacy. Gluckman has explored extensively the principles of science advice through a blog, lectures, and in the scientific press. In 2012 he established and chaired the first formalized regional network of Chief Science Advisors and Equivalents of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. He also established the Small Advanced Economies Initiative (SAEI) as a mechanism to bring together policy makers from small, advanced countries where science and innovation are core tools of development, to work collaboratively on shared issues and ideas. In 2013 he was requested by the International Council for Science (ICSU; now the International Science Council) to consider the development of an international network of science advisors. This led Gluckman to host and chair the inaugural Science Advice to Governments Conference, convened by the International Council for Science, in August 2014 in Auckland, New Zealand. It was the first global meeting of high-level science advisors, academies, and academics. In June 2018, Gluckman stepped down from his role as the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor, and was replaced by Juliet Gerrard. On 5 July he was elected to the position of President-elect of the International Science Council at its inaugural meeting in Paris. He is Director of the newly established Koi T≈´: The Centre for Informed Futures, a University of Auckland Faculty of Arts Research Centre. Honours and awards Gluckman is a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, an honour bestowed on just 42 New Zealand-born scientists since the Society's establishment in 1660. In 2001, Gluckman received New Zealand's top science award, the Rutherford Medal. In 2004 Gluckman was named as the New Zealand Herald New Zealander of the Year, also winning the KEA/NZTE World Class New Zealander Award in 2006. In the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, Gluckman was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to medicine. He was promoted to Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to medicine, in the 2008 New Year Honours. In 2009, following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government, he accepted redesignation as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. In the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours, Gluckman was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand, the country's highest civilian honour, restricted to 20 living New Zealanders. Gluckman received the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Award for Science Diplomacy, in 2016. In 2019 he was named New Zealand Communicator of the Year by BlacklandPR.

He served in the governing Social Credit caucus during his time in the Legislature representing the electoral district of Olds. Political career Cook first ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature in the 1926 Alberta general election. He contested the Olds provincial electoral district as a Liberal candidate. He was handily defeated finishing a distant second to Incumbent United Farmers of Alberta MLA Nelson Smith. Cook ran for Social Credit nomination for Olds in the 1935 Alberta general election but lost to Herbert Ash who would end up becoming the new MLA. Just prior to the 1940 Alberta general election, Ash was removed from the Social Credit caucus and Cook was picked as the new candidate by the Social Credit Advisory Board. Ash decided to run anyway under the Independent Social Credit banner. The race was joined by Independent candidate Frank Grisdale the former Minister of Agriculture whom Ash defeated in 1935. On election night Grisdale was leading Cook by 110 votes on the first count, while Ash was trailing a distant third. Grisdale did not gain a 50% majority, and was defeated by less than 100 votes after Ash second choice preferences were cast. Cook ran for his second term in office in the 1944 Alberta general election. Despite running against two other candidates, he swept the district with nearly 67% of the popular vote. Cook continued to gain in popularity, winning a super majority of 74% in his re-election bid for the 1948 Alberta general election. Cook died in 1950, causing his district to become vacant.

Emperor Mingzong's edict ordering An's execution was on June 26, but based on the Zizhi Tongjian description was issued after An's death.) (, fl. 10th century) was the chief of staff (Shumishi) and chief advisor to Li Siyuan (Emperor Mingzong) (r. 926‚Äì933) of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Later Tang. For most of Emperor Mingzong's reign, An was the most powerful figure at court, making key military and political decisions that, in his eyes, sought to strengthen the authority of the Later Tang imperial state. However, his ruthless actions toward political enemies‚Äîincluding Emperor Mingzong's adoptive son Li Congke the Prince of Lu‚Äîcreated much resentment. After the campaign against the regional warlords Meng Zhixiang and Dong Zhang, which An instigated, stalled, An was forced to retire, and then was killed in retirement, under accusations that he had alienated Meng, Dong, and the Later Tang vassal Qian Liu the King of Wuyue, from the Later Tang emperor. He was said to have, at his death, lamented that he was not able to rid the state of Li Congke.  Background  It is not known when An Chonghui was born, but it is known that his family was from Ying Prefecture (ÊáâÂ∑û, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi)New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 24. and that his ancestors were tribal chiefs in the region.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 66. His father An Fuqian () was known for ferocity in battle and became an officer under the late-Tang Dynasty major warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). In 894, when Li Keyong's allies Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Zhu Xuan's cousin Zhu Jin the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) sought aid from Li Keyong as they were under attack by Li Keyong's archrival Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), Li Keyong sent An Fuqian and two brothers‚Äîolder brother An Fushun () and An Fuqing (), who was likely older as well‚Äîwith 500 cavalry soldiers, to aid Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. An Fuqian was subsequently killed in battle when fighting the Xuanwu forces.  During Li Cunxu's reign  The first historical reference made to An Chonghui himself was in 916, by which time Tang had ended, and the sons of Li Keyong and Zhu Quanzhong were ruling separate and rival realms that they inherited from their fathers‚ÄîLi Keyong's son Li Cunxu as the Prince of Jin and Zhu Quanzhong's son Zhu Zhen as the Emperor of Later Liang. In 916, Li Cunxu made his adoptive brother Li Siyuan the military governor of Anguo Circuit (ÂÆâÂúã, headquartered in modern Xingtai, Hebei). An was then serving under Li Siyuan with the officer rank of Zhongmenshi () and faithful to Li Siyuan, and Li Siyuan trusted him deeply.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. He was friendly with Li Siyuan's sons Li Congrong and Li Conghou from Li Congrong's and Li Conghou's childhood, and the brothers respected him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. However, he did not have a good relationship with Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke, as there was a time when they were drinking and got into an argument, and Li Congke beat him badly. Li Congke later apologized, but An continued to bear a grudge against Li Congke. For more than a decade, An followed Li Siyuan in his campaigns serving under Li Cunxu, who eventually declared himself emperor of a new Later Tang (as its Emperor Zhuangzong) and conquered Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. However, by 926, the Later Tang realm was overrun by mutinies after Emperor Zhuangzong had, without good cause, executed two of the major generals, Guo Chongtao and Zhu Youqian. When Li Siyuan was sent to battle the mutineers at Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei), Li Siyuan's own forces mutinied and forced him to join the Yedu mutineers. After Li Siyuan freed himself from the Yedu mutineers, he considered returning to his own circuit Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), which he was then the military governor of, to consider his next step, but An and Li Siyuan's deputy Li Shaozhen pointed out that that exposed him to be defenseless against charges that another general, Li Shaorong, might lay against him, convinced him to head south back toward the capital Luoyang instead. Subsequently, with Li Shaorong indeed accusing Li Siyuan of treason and cutting off Li Siyuan's attempts to send messengers to Emperor Zhuangzong to defend himself, Li Siyuan decided to indeed rebel, and therefore had An draft summons on his behalf, asking other generals to join his army, as he advanced toward Kaifeng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Li Siyuan quickly entered Kaifeng, and then from there advanced toward Luoyang. Emperor Zhuangzong organized an army to try to resist him, but was shortly thereafter killed in a mutiny at Luoyang. When Li Siyuan arrived at Luoyang, he was welcomed into the city and assumed, for the time, the title of regent. He made An his chief of staff, with Zhang Yanlang, whose daughter was An's daughter-in-law, serving as An's deputy. Meanwhile, An and Li Shaozhen tried to get the political situation ready for Li Siyuan's eventual enthronement, by killing Li Cunxu's brothers Li Cunque () the Prince of Tong and Li Cunji () the Prince of Ya, without Li Siyuan's prior approval. Later, after Li Cunxu's oldest son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei committed suicide as his army refused to follow him in a campaign against Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan took the throne (as Emperor Mingzong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275.  During Li Siyuan's reign  As shumishi = During the Tiancheng era (926‚Äì930)  An Chonghui quickly became the most powerful advisor for Emperor Mingzong, and, as Emperor Mingzong was illiterate, he relied on An to read to him the petitions coming from throughout the realm, although An, realizing that he was also not capable of handling all these petitions, recommended the imperial scholars Feng Dao and Zhao Feng to serve in that role. As chief advisor, however, he quickly developed a rivalry with the chancellor Ren Huan, as Ren was putting much of his own imprint on the governance, drawing An's jealousy. Meanwhile, Emperor Mingzong wanted to reward An by commissioning him as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) and serving remotely (with an acting military governor at the circuit itself). An believed that Shannan East was too important of a circuit to lack an actual military governor at the circuit, and therefore declined; Emperor Mingzong subsequently agreed. Despite his faithfulness to Emperor Mingzong, An was also known for his arrogance and violence. When the minor official Ma Yan () accidentally collided with his train, An had Ma executed on the spot. When the imperial censor Li Qi reported this to Emperor Mingzong, Emperor Mingzong reacted, at An's request, by issuing an edict blaming the executed-Ma for the incident and declaring that the people should be careful in respecting the senior officials of the state. Later, in 927, An and Ren had a major disagreement about whom to recommend to be chancellors to replace two chancellors recently removed from office, Doulu Ge and Wei Shuo; Ren recommended Li Qi while An recommended Cui Xie at the suggestion of his close associate Kong Xun; Emperor Mingzong ultimately chose Cui and Feng to serve as chancellors, replacing Doulu and Wei. Shortly after, Emperor Mingzong also bestowed chancellor titles on An and Kong, with An receiving the greater title of Shizhong (), making him more honored than other chancellors. Emperor Mingzong eventually became displeased at Ren's continuous arguments with An, believing that to be an affront to himself, and when Ren, noticing the emperor's displeasure, offered to resign his secondary position as the director of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies), Emperor Mingzong accepted the resignation. In fall 927, Ren retired completely to Ci Prefecture (Á£ÅÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), but shortly after, when the general Zhu Shouyin the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng) rebelled, An, believing that Ren could be complicit, requested Emperor Mingzong to order Ren to commit suicide, and Emperor Mingzong did so. By late 926, An had begun to be concerned about two powerful military governors that Emperor Zhuangzong had commissioned prior to his death to govern the former territory of Former Shu‚ÄîMeng Zhixiang the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and Dong Zhang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), because Meng was closely related to Emperor Zhuangzong (as his wife was a niece of Li Keyong's and therefore a cousin of Emperor Zhuangzong's) and Dong was a favored general of Emperor Zhuangzong's. Meng was also acting fairly independently as the military governor of Xichuan Circuit, as he refused to yield tax revenues to the imperial administration. The official Li Yan () volunteered to serve as a monitor to the Xichuan army, believing that he could help curb Meng's exercise of authority, and An then sent him to Xichuan. Meng subsequently had Li executed, and another officer, Zhu Hongzhao, whom An sent to Dongchuan to serve as Dong's deputy military governor for a similar reason, fled back to Luoyang. In late 927, Yang Pu the king of Later Tang's southeastern neighbor Wu declared himself emperor, thus putting himself at the same level, title- wise, as the Later Tang emperor. An advocated a campaign against Wu, but Emperor Mingzong ruled against it. However, subsequently, apparently with Emperor Mingzong's approval, An cut off the diplomatic communications between the two states, which had been frequent ever since Emperor Zhuangzong's destruction of Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 928, a rift developed between An and Kong, over the fact that Kong advised An against giving a daughter to one of Emperor Mingzong's sons in marriage, on the rationale that it would be improper for someone already so powerful to further engender himself to the emperor by a marriage of their children‚Äîand then himself gave a daughter in marriage to be the wife of Emperor Mingzong's son Li Conghou. An thus had Kong expelled from the imperial government to serve as the defender of Luoyang (as Emperor Mingzong was himself at Kaifeng at that time). However, when An had a dispute with Wang Jianli the military governor of Chengde, with accusations flying both ways‚ÄîAn accusing Wang of being aligned with the semi- independent warlord Wang Du the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), while Wang Jianli accused An of allying himself with Zhang Yanlang and creating a power bloc. Emperor Mingzong, unhappy with what he saw of An, briefly considered replacing him with Wang Jianli, but ultimately did not do so, but kept Wang at Kaifeng as a chancellor and the director of the three financial agencies. Emperor Mingzong subsequently gave An the additional title of mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region). Also in 928, Wang Du, who had been concerned about an imperial government takeover of his circuit, partly because An had begun to reimpose imperial laws on Yiwu whereas Yiwu had acted independently previously, tried to assassinate the imperial general Wang Yanqiu, whose army was then stationed near Yiwu's capital Ding Prefecture () in anticipation of a potential Khitan attack. Emperor Mingzong declared a general campaign against Wang Du, with Wang Yanqiu in command. In 929, Wang Yanqiu was able to capture Ding Prefecture, despite Wang Du's being aided by the Khitan general Tunei (); Wang Du committed suicide, allowing the imperial government to take over Yiwu. One of Emperor Mingzong's sons or nephews, Li Congcan (),The Zizhi Tongjian stated that Li Congcan was a son of Emperor Mingzong's; the History of the Five Dynasties implied that Li Congcan was a son of Emperor Mingzong's; but the New History of the Five Dynasties stated that Li Congcan was a nephew. Compare Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276 with History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 51 and New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 15. had long not been willing to yield himself to An. In 929, there was an incident in which Li Congcan was drunk at a feast and, in that drunkenness, sat on the emperor's seat as a joke. An took this opportunity to report this to Emperor Mingzong and recommend Li Congcan's death; as a result, Emperor Mingzong ordered Li Congcan to commit suicide. Meanwhile, An was also in dispute with Later Tang's vassal, Qian Liu the King of Wuyue, as he was displeased at Qian's arrogant wording while writing him. In 929, there was an incident where Emperor Mingzong sent his attendants Wu Zhaoyu () and Han Mei () as emissaries to Wuyue. Han, who had an enmity with Wu, reported, upon return from Wuyue, that Wu not only bowed to Qian and referred to himself as Qian's subject, but also revealed secrets to Qian. An recommended that Wu be ordered to commit suicide, and subsequently ordered Qian to retire with the title of Taishi (), stripping him of all other titles, while putting all Wuyue emissaries under arrest. Qian had his sons submit petitions proclaiming his innocence, but An (and Emperor Mingzong) ignored them. An, around the same time, was continuing to prepare for the possibility of confrontation with Meng and Dong, by carving out territories from their circuits‚Äîwith Li Renju () serving as the military governor of Baoning Circuit (‰øùÂØß, headquartered in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), Xia Luqi () serving as the military governor of Wuxin Circuit (Ê≠¶‰ø°, headquartered in modern Suining, Sichuan), and An's brother-in-law Wu Qianyu () serving as the prefect of Mian Prefecture (Á∂øÂ∑û, in modern Mianyang), each reinforced with soldiers from the imperial army. This, in turn, led to fears from both Meng and Dong that the imperial government would soon be acting against them. Despite their prior rivalry, Meng and Dong entered into an alliance and prepared to jointly fight the Later Tang imperial government.  During the Changxing era (930‚Äì931)  Meanwhile, An Chonghui continuously accused Li Congke, who was then the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), but Emperor Mingzong took no heed. In 930, An instructed Li Congke's officer Yang Yanwen () to expel Li Congke, and Yang did so when Li Congke happened to be out of the city (Huguo's capital Hezhong Municipality () on a hunt, by closing the city gates and refusing to let Li Congke reenter. When Li Congke questioned why Yang was doing what he was doing, Yang responded, \\"It is not that I, Yang Yanwen, turns back on your graciousness, but I received an instruction from the Office of the Chief of Staff, asking you, Lord, to report to the imperial government.\\" When Li Congke reported this to Emperor Mingzong, Emperor Mingzong summoned him to Luoyang, where the emperor was at the time. An disclaimed any involvement and advocated sending an army to attack Yang. Emperor Mingzong thus sent the generals Suo Zitong () and Yao Yanchou () to attack Yang but giving them instructions to capture Yang alive. Suo and Yao, apparently at An's instruction, however, killed Yang when they captured Hezhong. Thereafter, An had Feng Dao and Zhao Feng propose that Li Congke be punished for losing the circuit to a mutiny, but Emperor Mingzong rebuffed them, as he did An when An personally requested, citing how Li Congke had been his son ever since a young age. Still, he ordered Li Congke to stay at his own mansion and not be allowed to attend imperial gatherings. When Suo was subsequently made the military governor of Huguo, he, at An's direction, submitted weapons and claimed that those were weapons privately made by Li Congke, implying that Li Congke was planning a rebellion. However, Li Congke escaped further punishment at the intercession of Emperor Mingzong's favorite concubine, Consort Wang. Around this time, the officers Li Xingde () and Zhang Jian () induced one Bian Yanwen () to falsely accuse An of planning a rebellion and doing so by requesting the command of an army to attack Wu. The generals An Congjin and Yao, however, vouched for An Chonghui, so Emperor Mingzong executed Bian (and later, after discovering Li's and Zhang's parts in this false report, them as well). By fall 930, Meng and Dong were preparing to rebel, but Dong made one last-ditch attempt to stop the imperial government from what he and Meng saw as provocative deployments‚Äîby having his son Dong Guangye (), who served as the director of imperial gardens at the capital Luoyang, inform An Chonghui's deputy Li Qianhui () that if the imperial government sent more soldiers into the region, he would rebel. (However, as noted by, inter alia, the modern historian Bo Yang, Dong's threat had the exact opposite effect, since An's intent was to force Dong and Meng into rebellion so that he could destroy them.)Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 68 (930). When An thereafter, in fall 930, sent the officer Xun Xian'ai () to reinforce Baoning's capital Lang Prefecture (), Dong publicly declared his rebellion, and he and Meng joined their forces to prepare to attack Baoning, Wuxin, and Zhaowu (Êò≠Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan) Circuits, which were loyal to the imperial government. When the news came, An advocated a general campaign against them, and Emperor Mingzong agreed. By this point, however, due to An's lengthy hold on power, he had created many political enemies, and both Consort Wang and the eunuch Meng Hanqiong were repeatedly accusing An of faults. An, apprehensive of what might happen, offered to resign, which caused Emperor Mingzong further displeasure, believing that An was abandoning him. Still, he considered replacing An with Fan Yanguang, who, however, persuaded Emperor Mingzong that An needed to remain, as did Zhao, despite Feng's view that An could only protect himself by resigning. Subsequently, Emperor Mingzong made Fan a chief of staff as well, serving with An. Emperor Mingzong sent his son-in-law, the general Shi Jingtang, to be in charge of the overall operations against Meng and Dong, but the imperial army ran into difficulties in advancing against Meng's and Dong's troops, while the garrisons of prefectures loyal to the imperial government were being captured one by one by Meng and Dong. In late 930, An offered to head to the frontline to oversee the campaign himself, and Emperor Mingzong agreed. It was said that when this was announced, the circuits which were previously not diligent in delivering the supplies to the army were all frightened and began to deliver supplies in haste. However, Shi himself did not support the campaign, and as soon as An left Luoyang, Shi began submitting petitions urging the end to the campaign. Before An could actually reach the frontline, in spring 931, he stopped at Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), whose military governor, Zhu Hongzhao, had received the post due to his relationship with An. When An reached Fengxiang, Zhu welcomed him with great fanfare, including bowing to An himself as An was arriving, and having his wife to come out to bow to An as well. At a feast held in An's honor by Zhu, An tearfully stated to Zhu, \\"The wicked people have continuously accused me, such that I have almost fallen. It is only by the clear understanding of the Sovereign that my family has been spared.\\" As soon as An departed Fengxiang and continued to head to the frontline, however, Zhu twisted this statement in a report to Emperor Mingzong, accusing An of being resentful and possibly considering seizing Shi's command when he reached the frontline; he also wrote Shi, reporting the same thing. Shi, fearful, also submitted a report urging Emperor Mingzong to recall An. Emperor Mingzong therefore did. When An received the order and headed back toward Luoyang, Fengxiang refused him entry. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, back toward Luoyang as quickly as he could. However, before he could reach there, Emperor Mingzong issued an edict making him the military governor of Huguo, thus preventing his return to Luoyang, despite Zhao's attempt at interceding for him. = After removal = After An Chonghui's removal as chief of staff, Emperor Mingzong summoned Li Congke to his presence and reunited with him. Emperor Mingzong also restored Qian Liu's offices, blaming the tension between the Later Tang imperial government and the Wuyue king on An. By summer 931, An, who was fearful of what might happen next, requested complete retirement. Emperor Mingzong agreed and allowed him to retire with the honorary title of Taizi Taishi (). On the same day, An's sons An Chongzan () and An Chongxu (), fearing of what might happen next, fled their imperial government posts and headed to Hezhong. Emperor Mingzong, apparently fearing that An might resist, commissioned his nephew Li Congzhang () as the new military governor of Huguo, while sending Yao Yanchou with an army heading for Hezhong. When An Chongzan and An Chongxu arrived at Hezhong, An Chonghui put them under arrest and delivered them toward Luoyang, although when they reached Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), by Emperor Mingzong's orders, they were imprisoned there and not taken to Luoyang. Emperor Mingzong also sent the official Zhai Guangye (), who had long resented An, to Hezhong, to monitor the situation, stating to him, \\"If An Chonghui has wrongful intensions, then kill him.\\" Once both Zhai and Li Congzhang reached Hezhong, Li Congzhang had An's mansion surrounded by soldiers, and then personally entered to see An. As he bowed to An, An, who was not expecting that, stepped down to him to pull him up. As An did, Li Congzhang pulled out a hammer and battered An's head with it, killing him. An's wife Lady Zhang, in shock, rushed there to try to save him. Li Congzhang also killed her with the hammer. Shortly after, Emperor Mingzong issued an edict, accusing An of the crimes of alienating Meng Zhixiang, Dong Zhang, and Qian from the imperial government, as well as planning to take command of an army in attacking Wu and summoning his two sons back to Huguo. The edict ordered his death as well as the deaths of An Chongzan and An Chongxu. Li Congzhang had the clothes stripped off the bodies of An and Lady Zhang and had them exposed for a day. It was only later at the urging of the officer Bai Congzhang () that Li Congzhang allowed the bodies to be reclothed again. However, his other children were spared.

The artificially generated motor neurons exhibited profiles the same as those normal natural ones, including functions like electrophysiological activity which is the signature of neurons. Zhang described this study, \\"... you need to teach the blastocyst stem cells to change step by step, where each step has different conditions and a strict window of time\\". This research would have high significance for those human diseases or injuries related to spinal cord or motor neurons.

Furthermore, he politically supported fellow Nazi Max Clara's attempts to obtain professorship at the University of Leipzig. On May 1, 1945, after killing his family with potassium cyanide, de Crinis committed suicide by taking a cyanide tablet.

He is widely known for his wood-cut machine (used for extracting the fibres needed for pulping wood). Unlike Charles Fenerty, F.G. Keller took out a patent for his wood-cut invention.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.28, 33-34  Early life  Keller spent his childhood and youth working for his father as a weaver and heddle-maker in Hainichen, Saxony (north-eastern Germany). But he was unhappy in this occupation since his interest was in machines. Keller carried with him an \\"idea-book\\", where he jotted down different kinds of machines. He had subscriptions to many of the leading publications on machines, and was well read in the sciences of mechanics. In his late years he recalled an article he read in his youth about the work of the French mathematician Ren√© Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur. He took great interest in R√©aumur's works and was curious about his efforts to find a method for making paper from trees. R√©aumur himself never pursued the idea (later saying in 1742, \\"I am ashamed not yet to have tried this [paper making from trees] experiment since it is more than twenty years since I have realized the importance of it and since I have announced it.\\"). It was an idea that stuck with Keller. In 1841 the 25-year-old Keller jotted down in his \\"idea-book\\" ideas for a wood-cut machine that could extract the fibres from trees for use in pulped-wood paper making. The F.G. Keller wood-grinding machine c.1854  Keller's invention  Before wood pulp became widely available, paper was made from rags, which were a limited resource. In the 18th century French scientist Ren√© Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur suggested that paper could be made from trees.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.30-33 Though he himself never experimented, his theory caught the interest of others, namely Matthias Koops. In 1800 Koops published a book on papermaking made from straw. Its outer covers were made from trees. His method was not like Fenerty's (pulping wood); instead, he simply ground the wood and caused the particles to adhere. His book does not mention anything about wood pulping.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.30-32Some books about Koops' discovery affirm or suggest that his book was partially made from wood pulp, but this is not the case. Koops clearly outlines his method for making paper from straw and trees by taking wood shavings, adhering them, and pressing them together to make a sheet of paper. From 1841 (after noting his idea), Keller worked eagerly on his wood-cut machine. He had spent most of his life so far working with his father as a weaver and heddle maker, and on the side attempting to invent all sorts of machines. A wood-cut machine, however, became his true passion, to which he remained dedicated over the following three years (from 1841 to 1844). In 1844 he completed his work and produced a piece of pulped wood paper from the output of his wood-cut machine. In the summer of 1844 he sent in a sample paper to the German government, hoping to obtain financial support for an improved wood-grinder machine and to develop papermaking further, but without success. Both Charles Fenerty and F.G. Keller started working on wood-based paper at the same time, and made their discovery public at the same time, and at the same time found that no one was interested in it. Keller remained dedicated to the project, but since he could not obtain national support he sold his invention to a paper specialist, Heinrich Voelter, for about ¬£80. A patent was granted in August 1845 in Saxony, Germany, in both names (Keller and Voelter), and Voelter began production on a mass scale. Voelter did not want to leave Keller out at first because only Keller possessed the knowledge of how to build a suitable wood-grinding machine. Eventually that changed. After 1848 the first machines came out, and in 1852 the renewal of the patent came due, but Keller did not have the money to renew his part of the patent. Therefore, Voelter became the sole patent holder and continued the work, earning a large profit, without Keller.  Later years  Heinrich Voelter remained the sole patent holder, leaving Keller unemployed and penniless. The wood-grinding machine was a success, though. Voelter had sold many throughout Europe and the Americas. By 1852 ground-wood pulped paper was being produced regularly in the mill of \\"H. Voelter‚Äôs Sons\\" in Heidenheim, Germany. The \\"Frankenberger Intelligence and Weekly\\" (in Saxony, Germany) was the first newspaper to use Keller's invention, pulped wood newsprint. It took a couple decades for newspaper and book printers to take over the idea of using pulped wood instead of pulped rags to produce paper, but by the 1860s the new process had gained much popularity, and the transition began. By the end of the 19th-century few printers in the Western world were still using rags in lieu of wood for paper making. Throughout his life, Keller received no royalties from his invention. However, in 1870 he received from a number of German paper makers and other associations a small sum of money, which he used to buy a house in Krippen, Germany. Towards the end of his life a fair sum of money was collected for him in various countries, enough for a worry-free retirement, and he also received several awards in recognition of his invention.

He was the only player to appear in both Southampton's first-ever FA Cup match and first-ever League match. Described as a \\"sturdy, reliable defender\\", he was equally at home at either full-back or half-back. Marshall was also a cricketer with Hampshire. Football career Marshall was born in Southampton and played rugby in his youth before converting to \\"soccer\\", joining the newly formed St. Mary's Football Club in 1888. He made his first competitive appearance for St. Mary's in 1891, helping the club to win the Hampshire Senior Cup, defeating a team from the Royal Engineers, Aldershot 3‚Äì1 at the County Ground. The following season, the \\"Saints\\" entered the FA Cup for the first time, being drawn away to Warmley (near Bristol) in the First Qualifying Round where they won comfortably 4‚Äì1, with Marshall playing at right-back. Although the Saints defeated Reading 7‚Äì0 in the next round, they were subsequently disqualified for fielding two ineligible players. Despite the disappointment of the FA Cup exit, Marshall once again helped the team to claim the Hampshire Senior Cup in March 1892, and was called up to play for Hampshire. In each of the next two seasons, the Saints were defeated in the second qualifying round of the FA Cup, going down 4‚Äì0 to Maidenhead United at the Antelope Ground in October 1892 and 2‚Äì1 at Reading in November 1893. In 1894, Southampton were one of the nine founder members of the Southern League, which had been created to enable clubs in southern England, who were not admitted to the Football League to play competitive football on a regular basis. Marshall played in all but two of the League matches in the inaugural season, at right-back with Bill Jeffrey alongside him on the left. At the end of the season, the Saints were in third place in the league, behind Millwall Athletic and Luton Town. Marshall also played in all five matches in the FA Cup, where they reached the First Round Proper for the first time, going down 4‚Äì1 to Nottingham Forest of the First Division with two goals from Thomas Rose. At the start of the following season, Marshall was moved forward to left-half although he missed several matches through injury, making only eight league appearances. Having played in every FA Cup match since the Saints first entered in 1891, Marshall missed the match at home to Reading on 23 November 1895, when he was replaced by Joe Rogers. Although Marshall regained his place for the next round, he was again not selected for the First Round Proper match against The Wednesday, with John Hodgkinson taking over, as the Saints went down 3‚Äì2. In the summer of 1896, as a result of his injuries, Marshall retired from football to concentrate on his career with the Ordnance Survey. In his six seasons with Southampton, he made a total of 36 appearances in the Southern League or FA Cup, plus many more in friendlies and local cup competitions. Cricket career Marshall was also an occasional cricketer and made one first-eleven appearance for Hampshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in June 1894, when he scored a total of five runs.Hampshire v Marylebone Cricket Club June 1894 (Scorecard) He later went to stand as an umpire at the County Ground.

Schneider is said to exemplify the descent of a distinguished academic psychiatrist into the Nazi worldview. Some described him as having shown great empathy in his psychiatric rehabilitation work, and having a great idealism about transforming the 'horror' of psychiatric patients thought to be regressed, isolated and backward.

In 1983 she was elected to North Sydney Municipal Council an independent alderman at age 25, serving until 1985 when she contested a by-election for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Gloucester on 12 October. Winning the safe National Party seat, she became the first woman to represent the National Party in the Legislative Assembly. She founded her company Machin Consulting in the same year. Her original seat of Gloucester was abolished before the 1988 state election, so she stood for the newly recreated seat of Manning which covered the a portion of the same area. Manning was subsequently abolished after one term. The bulk of its territory was merged into Port Macquarie at the 1991 state election, and Machin successfully transferred there. Machin was Deputy Speaker and became the first woman to chair the New South Wales Parliament. She appointed Minister for Consumer Affairs in the coalition government of John Fahey on 26 May 1993. The election of the Carr Labor government in 1995 saw the coalition in opposition. Machin was appointed shadow minister for Consumer Affairs, Roads and Fisheries until she resigned from Parliament on 28 August 1996 after the birth of her second child. Her resignation prompted the 1996 Port Macquarie by election, won by then National Party member Rob Oakeshott. Post-parliamentary career Machin became the President of Save the Children Fund NSW in 1996, remaining in that position until 2000, as well as serving on the National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. Between 1997 and 2000 Machin was the Deputy Chair of the Australian Republican Movement. She was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in February 1998, elected by a voluntary ballot run by the Australian Electoral Commission In 2005, Machin was elected to the board of the NRMA to represent the Coghlan region, which stretches from the Hunter River to the Queensland border. Following her re-election to the NRMA board on 8 December 2008, Machin became President on 10 December until November 2014. Private life Wendy Machin married David Bell, the former chief executive of the Australian Bankers' Association, a former senior executive at Westpac, the CEO of the Actuaries Institute and who is now the MD of CT Australasia, on 20 July 1991 and they have 3 children; James, Georgia and Emma. Her only sibling, Janne, was left profoundly disabled after a difficult birth.

He is known for the discoveries of kinetic Alfven waves, toroidal Alfven eigenmodes, and energetic particle modes; the theories of geomagnetic pulsations, Alfven wave heating, and fishbone oscillations; and the first formulation of nonlinear gyrokinetic equations. Chen retired from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in 2012, assuming the title Professor Emeritus of physics and astronomy. Biography Chen's ancestral family name is Huang (ÈªÉ), he is a descendant of Chengliang Huang (ÈªÉÊæÑÈáè, founder of the Five- Osmanthus Building (‰∫îÊ°ÇÊ®ìÔºâlibrary, and the great scholar and thinker Zongxi Huang (ÈªÉÂÆóÁæ≤). His great grandfather, Chengyi Huang (ÈªÉÊâø‰πô) was the mayor of Taiwan County, now Taichung City (Âè∞‰∏≠Â∏Ç), during the Guangxu period of Qing Dynasty. Chen was born in 1946 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. In 1950, after the defeat of the Nationalists by the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Chen left Mainland China with his mother, Shyue Yan King Chen (ÈáëÂ≠∏Ë®Ä, 1916-2006), and three siblings. They joined his father, Lee Chen (Èô≥Á¶Æ, 1913-2003), at the Tiu Keng Leng refugee camp in Hong Kong, where he began his education. The Chen family moved to Taiwan in 1951. Chen was married to Shingshah Lee (ÊùéÈÜíÂ§è) in August 1969. They have one son Peijin (Èô≥ÂüπÈÄ≤). Chen graduated from the Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University in 1962. In 1966, he took his undergraduate degree at National Taiwan University. Chen went to United States for graduate schooling in 1967, where he obtained a Master of Science Degree from Washington State University, Pullman in 1969, and a Doctor of Philosophy Degree from the University of California, Berkeley under the supervision of Charles K. Birdsall in 1972, for his research work I. Heating of Magnetized Plasmas by Large-Amplitude Electric Field. II. Reduction of the Grid Effects in Simulation Plasmas. From 1972 to 1974, Chen did his postdoctoral research with Akira Hasegawa at the Bell Labs. They developed a theory for long-period magnetic pulsations in the magnetosphere based on resonant coupling between hydromagnetic compressional waves and transverse Alfv√©n continuous spectrum. This theory, later referred to as Chen-Hasegawa field-line-resonance model, successfully explained the observations in the Earth's magnetosphere by Louis J. Lanzerotti, and has become the standard model for magnetic pulsations in the Earth‚Äôs and other planetary magnetospheres. Soon, their focus turned to the charged particle heating via resonant absorption within Alfv√©n wave continuous spectrum. They discovered the Kinetic Alfv√©n wave, which resolves the logarithmic singularity of magnetohydrodynamic shear Alfv√©n waves and plays important roles in the heating, acceleration and transport of charged particles in solar, magnetospheric, and laboratory plasmas. Before joining the faculty at UCI, Chen was a professor at the Princeton University. Chen was the Deputy Head of the Theory Division of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. From 1993 till 2012, Chen was a professor of physics at UCI. Since 2012, Chen has been a professor emeritus.

Symptoms include pain, swelling, erythema and tenderness evolving over hours or days. It is often associated with the rupture or dissection of a popliteal cyst otherwise known as a Baker's cyst,1\\\\. Munk, Peter L Lee, Mark J. Ruptured Baker's cyst producing a pseudothrombophlebitis syndrome Canadian Journal of Surgery Aug 2000 43(4) 255 although it can be associated with other disorders such as the arthritides. It may also occur as an orthopaedic surgical complication, secondary to trauma or as a presentation of septic arthritis. It is crucial to differentiate this condition from deep vein thrombosis as the treatment for DVT can cause adverse effects in patients with pseudothrombophlebitis.  Presentation The symptoms of pseudothrombophlebitis include pain, swelling, erythema and tenderness. It most commonly, but not exclusively, affects the legs. The presence of a popliteal cyst makes this diagnosis more likely. However, the presence of a popliteal cyst does not rule out deep vein thrombosis and warrants further investigation. Pseudothrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis are not mutually exclusive conditions, and in rare instances may co-occur.Drescher MJ. Smally AJ. Thrombophlebitis and pseudothrombophlebitis in the ED. Am J Emerg Med. 15(7):683-5, 1997 Nov. Pseudothrombophlebitis is clinically indistinguishable from a true thrombophlebitis such as deep vein thrombosis; the symptoms and history are similar and these conditions cannot be distinguished by clinical examination without radiological or arthroscopic imaging. It is crucial however to differentiate pseudothrombophlebitis from DVT as the thrombolytic and anticoagulant treatments usually administered in DVT are not effective in treating pseudothrombophlebitis, and may have adverse effects exacerbating the condition.Drescher MJ. Smally AJ. Thrombophlebitis and pseudothrombophlebitis in the ED. Am J Emerg Med. 15(7):683-5, 1997 Nov.  Pathophysiology  Commonly, pseudothrombophlebitis is caused by rupture of a popliteal cyst causing leakage of synovial fluid, leading to inflammatory irritation to the gastrocnemius muscle. Pseudothrombophlebitis is not the only possible consequence of a popliteal cyst. The existence of a large popliteal cyst can be a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. Furthermore, a ruptured popliteal cyst may cause compartment syndrome in the calf or even the thigh.  Diagnosis  Where pseudothrombophlebitis and thrombophlebitis present as differential diagnoses, DVT is excluded by the absence of a deep vein thrombosis, and the presence of a popliteal cyst is suggestive of pseudothrombophlebitis. The differentiation requires the use of radiological or arthroscopic imaging modalities. In this condition, imaging modalities often indicated include the use of Doppler and non-Doppler ultrasound, arthrography, venography magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised axial tomography (CAT scan). Ultrasound modalities in general are useful for the detection of a ruptured or dissecting popliteal cysts, while Doppler ultrasound has the additional benefit of detecting venous stenosis such as that caused by deep vein thrombosis. Arthrography and venography using imaging dyes allow for the detection of popliteal cysts and the exclusion of thrombotic lesions but are invasive procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerised axial tomography scans allow for the detection of a ruptured or dissected popliteal cyst and, if in the same plane as the scan, the detection of a deep vein thrombosis.  Treatment  Once diagnosed, and after deep vein thrombosis other disease masquerades have been excluded, the treatment for pseudothrombophlebitis is supportive. This includes the use of anti- inflammatory medications such as NSAIDs.

It combined features from the Soviet ZiS-3 field\\\\anti-tank gun, the German PaK 40 and the Romanian 75 mm Vickers/Re»ôi»õa Model 1936 anti- aircraft gun. It saw service against both the Soviets during the Jassy- Kishniev Offensive and against the Germans during the Budapest Offensive and subsequent operations to clear Austria and Czechoslovakia. Development Development began in 1942 of a dual-purpose field and anti-tank gun that could be built in Romania to replace the collection of obsolescent field guns currently used and upgrade their anti-tank defenses of the army. To speed development Colonel Valerian Nestorescu suggested combining the best features from the guns already in service in Romania, Germany or captured from the Soviets. Colonel Nestorescu was selected to produce a prototype to be built at the Uzinele ≈üi Domeniile Re≈üi≈£a in Re≈üi≈£a. Three prototypes were built combining various features and trialled against the ZiS-3, a Re≈üi≈£a-built copy of the ZiS-3, the Pak 40 and the Schneider‚ÄìPutilov Model 1902/36 field gun in September 1943 and the third prototype had the greatest armor penetration. It was adopted as the ', commonly shortened to 75 mm Re≈üi≈£a Model 1943.Axworthy, pp. 235-6 Description DT-UDR 26 close-up view The gun combined the muzzle brake, recoil and firing mechanisms and split-trail carriage of the ZiS-3, the barrel, rifling and cartridge chamber of the Vickers/Re≈üi≈£a Model 1936 anti- aircraft gun and the projectile chamber of the Pak 40. It had a gun shield that consisted of two plates separated by a gap. It had only 680 parts, almost as few as the 610 of the ZiS-3, but far fewer than the 1200 of the Pak 40. It had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater penetrative power than the Pak 40. It therefore combined virtues of both the ZiS-3 and Pak 40. 1100 guns were ordered on 10 December 1943 from Uzinele »ôi Domeniile Re»ôi»õa, Astra in Bra≈üov and Concordia in Ploie≈üti.Axworthy, pp. 236-7 The 75 mm Re»ôi»õa Model 1943 fired a armor-piercing shell at . Penetration test consisted of eight armored shields with a thickness of 10 cm placed as follows: the first four were 300 meters (arranged at an angle of 30¬∫), the other three at 500 meters (same angle) and the last one at 1000 meters (in position File din trecutul artileriei rom√¢ne modern , p. 166 The engineer captain Eugen Burlacu was in charge of the firing with the \\"b\\" variant of the prototype no. 2. File din trecutul artileriei rom√¢ne modern , p. 167 These were nine (the first shot on the shield at 1000 meters did not reach the target) and they lasted a total of one minute and twenty seconds. The performance of the cannon was as follows: complete destruction of the first four shields at 300 meters, complete penetration of the three at 500 meters and penetrating the one at 1000 meters. However, this high muzzle velocity came at the cost of a very short barrel life, only 500 rounds, compared to the 6000 of a Pak 40. Its ammunition combined features of shells used by the Pak 40 and the Vickers/Re»ôi»õa Model 1936 anti-aircraft gun,Axworthy, p. 236 although this raises the issue of exactly how the Re»ôi»õa Model 1943 achieved such velocities. The Pak 40 had a muzzle velocity of when firing the light-weight, tungsten-cored Pzgr 40 shell, but the only data for the Re»ôi»õa give a shell weight of , which is roughly equivalent to the Pak 40's full-sized Pzgr 39 shell that was fired at a mere . Unfortunately detailed specifications for the Re»ôi»õa's ammunition haven't been discovered so that question will have to remain unanswered. The 75 mm Re»ôi»õa Model 1943 had a maximum elevation angle of 35 degrees, which allowed it to also be employed as a field gun. This was almost as much as the 37 degrees of the Soviet ZiS-3, a dedicated field gun, and significantly more than the 22 degrees of the German Pak-40 anti-tank gun. It could also depress slightly more than both (-7 degrees compared to -5 degrees of the other two guns). This made the Romanian gun arguably the most versatile in its class during World War II, outperforming its Western, German and Soviet equivalents.Axworthy, pp. 235-7 Operational use Breech inscriptions on the gun in Oradea, Romania. Serial number 394. The first twenty-four guns were issued to the 1st Armored Division in the spring of 1944 and later two independent anti-tank regiments with thirty-six guns apiece formed from the artillery regiments of the disbanded Frontier Division. Most of the cavalry and infantry divisions began to receive some guns during the summer of 1944. A total of 372 pieces were produced: 210 at the Re»ôi»õa works, 120 at the Astra Works in Bra»ôov and 42 at the Concordia Works in Ploie»ôti.Axworthy, p. 149 However, the gun displayed in Oradea has serial number 394, thus the production run was likely larger. Despite the losses suffered during the Soviet Jassy-Kishniev Offensive of August 1944 most divisions at the front in February 1945 had between six and twelve 75 mm Re»ôi»õa Model 1943 on hand.Axworthy, p. 237 After the war, the gun was relegated to secondary roles, such as training, because it had a western caliber. The 75 mm Re»ôi»õa Model 1943 was used until 1998, when it was phased out.Army Courier, no. 21(232) 15 November 2007, page 9 The gun was also used on the later prototypes of the Mare»ôal tank destroyer.

He is portrayed as a once dominant baseball pitcher, whose poor work ethic, ego, and short temper jeopardized his professional career. In season one, Powers becomes a substitute physical education teacher who is attempting to make a return to Major League Baseball. Character biography As a 19-year-old closing pitcher, Powers enjoys a spectacular Major League debut, leading Atlanta to the World Series. But Powers' abrasive personality leads him to trouble as he bounces from Atlanta to New York, then to San Francisco, Boston, and finally Seattle in subsequent years. Powers quickly wears out his welcome everywhere he goes, enraging fans with inflammatory statements as his fastball rapidly loses velocity. He tries to compensate for this weakness by using steroids to improve his performance, but in less than seven years he finds his Major League Baseball career over. Lost for direction, he goes back to his hometown of Shelby, North Carolina to accept a job as a substitute physical education teacher at his former school, Jefferson Davis Middle School. He simultaneously tries to win back the affections of former flame April Buchanon while also trying to earn another shot at the majors. He eventually flees to Mexico in shame when his planned Major League comeback fails to materialize. After laying low in Mexico and playing in an independent league, Kenny finally gets an opportunity for redemption when he's signed by the Myrtle Beach Mermen, the minor league affiliate of the Texas baseball organization. Though still prone to unpredictable and abrasive behavior, Powers manages to keep it together long enough to achieve his dream and he gets called up to pitch in the majors again. However, Powers fakes his own death, believing it is the only way to win back April's heart. Years after Kenny fakes his death (which he was arrested for) he lives in suburbia with his wife and two children as an employee of a car rental company. Upon meeting an old sports colleague, Kenny, who is fed up with his boring life, quits his job and gets his friend to offer him a guest spot on his show The Sports Sesh. After an embarrassing first appearance, Kenny trains to be better and verbally knocks the current wild card football star of the show until he quits, and Kenny received thunderous applause. Merchandise Baseball promoting Eastbound & Down HBO introduced officially licensed Eastbound & Down T-shirts featuring quotes from the show as well as shirts based on Kenny Powers' Atlanta and Charros jersey.

They were formed through the 'recycling' of more than 300 hectares of parks and former industrial land and are now the largest cluster of parks on Port Phillip Bay, interlinked by cycling and walking trails and featuring a surprisingly high diversity and abundance of landscapes, natural environment and recreational areas, including beachside recreation, picnic & barbecue facilities, grassfields and wildlife conservation areas. The wetlands form part of the Cheetham and Altona Important Bird Area. Constituent areas The parklands comprise the following areas: * Truganina Park * Truganina Explosives Reserve * Truganina Swamp * Kooringal Golf Course * Altona Treatment Plant * Apex Park * Doug Grant Reserve The Laverton Creek which runs south into Port Phillip Bay separates Truganina Park and Altona Treatment Plant on the western side from the other areas on the eastern side. Truganina Park is linked to Explosives Reserve by the Laverton Creek Bridge ‚Äì a wooden cycle and foot bridge. Truganina Park Truganina Park is a 25-hectares recreational and conservation park, 'recycled ' from the former Altona Landfill Tip, which was closed in 1998. A key feature of the Park is the 100 Steps to Federation, a stone staircase made from Bluestone basalt rocks recycled from the Tip. The steps lead to the highest land point between Melbourne and the You Yangs mountain ranges, where you can take in sweeping panoramic views of Melbourne City, Port Phillip Bay and the adjoining Cheetham Wetlands. The 17-metres high mound is topped by a sculpture called the Time Beacon, created by the artist Cameron Robbins and looking out over Port Phillip Bay. The Truganina Park is home to the endangered Altona skipper butterfly. A concrete drain, which takes stormwater from the adjacent residential Altona Meadows and runs through the Park, is restructured to form the Truganina Wetlands, which filter the stormwater and provide a habitat for aquatic birds. The park also contains picnic and barbecue facilities, with future plans for an adventure playground, climbing wall and nature trails. Truganina Park is managed by the Hobsons Bay City Council. Truganina Explosives Reserve The Truganina Explosives Reserve is a fenced-in area of 17 hectares of crown land, located 26 km west of Melbourne City at the mouth of Laverton Creek. The site was used for the handling, storage and shipping of explosives from 1901 to 1962. Explosives were manufactured at a Deer Park location and shipped out via the Magazine Pier adjacent to the reserve. These explosives were used in quarrying, mining and other industries throughout Australia. In 2000, after an extensive community campaign to save the site from sale, the site was reserved for conservation and conversion to a recreational parkland. A series of scientific studies have identified the site as highly significant for its archaeological, geological, geomorphological, floral, fauna, cultural and industrial heritage values. The high metal fence has protected the site from human access so the land has remained isolated for more than 100 years, growing wild, undisturbed by surrounding developments and allowing a separate indigenous ecosystem. The fence evokes a sense of enclosure, seclusion, intrigue for visitors and its continuous nature, without direct visual links to the modified external landscape, creates an atmosphere of tranquility. Past inhabitation by Aboriginal tribes about 6500 years ago was evidenced by the unearthing of many stone artefacts from the area. The site is regarded to have a high geomorphological significance. It has several broad low ridges up to 1.5 metres high which are believed to have been deposited on the sea floor about 6000 years ago, based on radiocarbon dating of their stratified shell beds. Distinct areas of native, exotic and saltmarsh vegetation combine with subtle undulations of the remnant dune system, resulting in landscapes of varying characters and exuding a secluded and timeless quality. The reserve is home to three bird species of state significance, the white-bellied sea eagle, Nankeen night heron and the brown quail. It also hosts four bat species, eight types of mammals and two types of reptiles. The Hobsons Bay City Council is managing the site and together with the Truganina Explosives Reserve Preservation Society, are restoring the Reserve to its original landscape, including the restoration of the historic Keepers Residence, built in 1897 to house the Officers in Charge of the Reserve. Public access has been limited to publicised Open Days and specially-arranged group tours while the site is being decontaminated. Decontamination of the site has recently been effected. Truganina Swamp This 175-hectare wetland, comprising grasses, salt marsh and sedges, is fed mainly by water from Laverton Creek, which originates in Truganina. Truganina Swamp provides habitats for two endangered species ‚Äì the Altona skipper butterfly, which feeds on chaffy saw sedge, and the orange- bellied parrot, which feeds on beaded glasswort and scrubland species of glasswort. The wetland is an important habitat for migratory wading birds such as pelicans, greenshanks, royal spoonbills and birds from as far as Siberia. It also supports many fish, such as black bream, common galaxias, short-finned eel, flat-headed gudgeon, Tamar River goby, small-mouthed hardyhead, goldfish, yellow-eyed mullet and mosquito fish. The site is archaeologically important as it used to be frequented by Kooris from the Woiworung and Bunurong tribe who foraged the area for its variety of animals, fish and plant food. Historically, Truganina Swamp was a terminal swamp with no defined outlet to Port Phillip Bay. With expanding urban development in Altona, the swamp was acquired by the Board of Works (now Melbourne Water) in 1961 for drainage and flood mitigation. The Laverton Creek channel was constructed to drain water to the Bay and widened to increase its capacity for carrying floodwater. A levee bank was built on the eastern side to protect the adjacent residential areas from floodwater. The Truganina Swamp became a haven for motorbike and trailbike riders and a dumping ground for cars and industrial rubbish. The Friends of Westona Wetlands were formed in 1993 and had persuaded Melbourne Water to install a fence to keep out illegal traffic and prevent access to ecologically-sensitive areas of the Swamp. This environmental group also worked with local companies such as Hoechst Chemicals (now Qenos) in constructing a bridge (from a disused walkway) in 1997 over the Saline Pond drain near the adjacent Port Phillip Retirement Village and Dow Chemicals in constructing a bird hide in 1998. The bird hide can be accessed from the entrance to Truganina Swamp on Bell Avenue. A walking and cycling trail encircles the swamp and links to the Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail across Queen Street. Ongoing projects for the Swamp include monitoring of the bird species, Altona skipper butterfly and chaffy saw sedge in the area, re-vegetation, seed collecting and progagation. Kooringal Golf Club Kooringal Golf Club is an 18-hole, 6.1 km long, par 71 course. It was inaugurated in 1946 as the Williamstown Golf Club. In 1958, its name was changed to Kooringal, an aboriginal word meaning \\"by the water\\", when Altona became a separate municipality. The site is the last remnant of a formerly extensive series of sand ridges that run parallel to the coast between the mouth of Kororoit Creek and Skeleton Creek. The ridges consist of well-stratified shell beds, and their composition and form suggests that they were not thrown up by storm waves but were formed as sea floor ridges and spits during the mid-Holocene era, when the sea level was 1‚Äì3 metres higher than at present. The present alignment of the golf course and its use as an open-space facility preserves the general form of the ridges. The ridges are important for analysing sea level changes over the last few thousand years. The site is one of a small number of mapped and dated localities on the Victorian coast that indicates higher Holocene sea levels. Altona Treatment Plant There are plans to open to the public, the living art sculpture named A Forest for Australia by Agnes Denes, an internationally renowned conceptual artist and a pioneer of environmental art, whose art works are often monumental in scale. In 1998, she planted 6000 endangered trees of varying heights (red gum, she oak and paperbark) into five intersecting spirals at the Altona Treatment Plant. The tallest trees were planted in the centre of each spiral, followed by the medium-height trees and the shortest trees towards the outer edges, thus forming each spiral into a step pyramid. Her spiral design considers the height and forms of each tree type when fully grown and overcomes the problem of land erosion and desertification at the site.

Tagore had been exposed to learning art when he first studied at the Sanskrit College in Kolkata in the 1880s. In his early years, Tagore had painted in the European naturalistic style, evident from his early paintings such as The Armoury. In about 1886 or 1887, Tagore's relative Gyanadanandini Devi had set up a meeting between Tagore and E.B Havell, who was the curator of the Government school of Art in Calcutta. The meeting resulted in a series of exchanges between Havell and Tagore, with Havell gaining a native art collaborator with ideas in the same direction of his own, and Tagore gaining a teacher who would teach him about the 'science' of Indian art history. Havell attempted to induct Tagore as the Vice Principal of the art school, which was faced with heavy opposition in the school. Havell had to bend much of the school rules to do this, and tolerated many of Tagore's habits including the smoking of hookah in the classrooms and refusing to stick to time schedules. Havell introduced innovations to his teaching program in an attempt to more accurately reproduce Indian art pedagogy, and replaced European copies of art with Indian originals. The English art curator had also reportedly spent many hours behind closed doors explaining the details of \\"Hindu art and sculpture\\" to Tagore. One of these paintings, of a stork by a Mughal-era artist, had been shown to Tagore by Havell, causing the former to remark that he was unaware until then of the \\"embarrassment of riches\\" that \\"our art\\" had contained. Subject Bharat Mata is depicted as a saffron-clad divine woman, holding a book, sheaves of paddy, a piece of white cloth and a rosary in her four hands. The painting holds historical significance as it is one of the earliest visualizations of Bharat Mata, or \\"Mother India.\\" Themes and composition The work was painted during the Swadeshi movement. The movement began as a response to the Partition of Bengal (1905), when Lord Curzon split the largely Muslim eastern areas of Bengal from the largely Hindu western areas. In response, Indian nationalists participating in the swadeshi movement resisted the British by boycotting British goods and institutions, holding meetings and processions, forming committees, and applying diplomatic pressure. The painting's central figure holds multiple items associated with Indian culture and the economy of India in the early twentieth century, such as a book, sheaves of paddy, a piece of white cloth and a garland. Moreover, the painting's central figure has four hands, evocative of Hindu imagery, which equates multiple hands with immense power. The painting has been characterized as \\"an attempt of humanisation of ‚ÄòBharat Mata‚Äô where the mother is seeking liberation through her sons,\\" by Jayanta Sengupta, curator of the Indian Museum in Kolkata, India. After completion Since 1905, many iterations of the Bharat Mata have been made in paintings and other forms of art. However, the significance of Tagore's original painting is still recognized. In 2016, Bharat Mata was put on display at the Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata, India. Sister Nivedita, the inspiration behind the Bengal School of Art, praised the painting by saying: > From beginning to end, the picture is an appeal, in the Indian language, to > the Indian heart. It is the first great masterpiece in a new style. I would > reprint- it, if I could, by tens of thousands, and scatter it broadcast over > the land, till there was not a peasant's cottage, or a craftman's hut, > between Kedar Nath and Cape Comorin, that had not this presentment of > Bharat-Mata somewhere on its walls. Over and over again, as one looks into > its qualities, one is struck by the purity and delicacy of the personality > portrayed.

This location is most often a central computer or database system, for example a desktop or server CPU, or a mainframe computer. In most cases, a centralized database would be used by an organization (e.g. a business company) or an institution (e.g. a university.) Users access a centralized database through a computer network which is able to give them access to the central CPU, which in turn maintains to the database itself. Historical context The first ever created computers were overly expensive and did not have separate terminals. Thus, the need for centralized computing quickly arose. As a result, a way for data to be not just processed, but to also be organized and stored was discovered. This gave way to the earliest versions of databases, their respective database management systems (DBMS) and, in turn, centralized databases. With the growing popularity of computers, more and more types of database orientation and design were introduced. Centralized databases however are still used today, especially where storing and processing data in large enterprises is concerned. An example for a centralized database could be given with the Australian Department of Defense, which centralized their databases in the mid 1970s. Advantages Centralized databases hold a substantial amount of advantages against other types of databases. Some of them are listed below: * Data integrity is maximized and data redundancy is minimised,http://www.mystudyroom.com.np/classnotes.php?nan=150&fire;=4&cake;=27&sun;=6&rnd;=577173844fe3450f92bab2.40075169 as the single storing place of all the data also implies that a given set of data only has one primary record. This aids in the maintaining of data as accurate and as consistent as possible and enhances data reliability. * Generally bigger data security, as the single data storage location implies only a one possible place from which the database can be attacked and sets of data can be stolen or tampered with. * Better data preservation than other types of databases due to often-included fault-tolerant setup. * Easier for using by the end-user due to the simplicity of having a single database design. * Generally easier data portability and database administration. * More cost effective than other types of database systems as labor, power supply and maintenance costs are all minimized. * Data kept in the same location is easier to be changed, re-organized, mirrored, or analyzed. * All the information can be accessed at the same time from the same location. * Updates to any given set of data are immediately received by every end-user. * Data integrity is maximized and data redundancy is minimised,[6] as the single storing place of all the data also implies that a given set of data only has one primary record. This aids in the maintaining of data as accurate and as consistent as possible and enhances data reliabilit Disadvantages Centralized databases also have a certain amount of limitations, such as those described below: * Centralized databases are highly dependent on network connectivity. The slower the internet connection is, the longer the database access time needed will be. * Bottlenecks can occur as a result of high traffic. * Limited access by more than one person to the same set of data as there is only one copy of it and it is maintained in a single location.http://utahicelanders.com/what-are-the-advantages-of-centralized- database/ This can lead to major decreases in the general efficiency of the system. * If there is no fault-tolerant setup and hardware failure occurs, all the data within the database will be lost. * Since there is minimal to no data redundancy, if a set of data is unexpectedly lost it is very hard to retrieve it back, in most cases it would have to be done manually. Centralised databases vs. Distributed databases The underlying idea of centralised databases is that they should be able to receive, maintain, and complete every single request that the main system must perform by themselves. There is only one database file, kept at a single location on a given network. A distributed database, however, is a database in which all the information is stored on multiple physical locations. Distributed databases are divided into two groups: homogeneous and heterogeneous. It relies on replication and duplication within its multiple sub-databases in order to maintain its records up to date. It is composed of multiple database files, all controlled by a central DBMS. The main differences between centralised and distributed databases arise due to their respective basic characteristics. Differences include but are not limited to: * Centralized databases store data on a single CPU bound to a single certain physical/geographical location. Distributed databases, however, rely on a central DBMS which manages all its different storage devices remotely, as it is not necessary for them to be kept in the same physical and/or geographical location. * As outlined above, centralised databases are easier to maintain up to date than distributed databases. This is so because distributed databases require additional (often manual) work to keep the data stored relevant, and to avoid data redundancy, as well as to improve the overall performance. * If data is lost in a centralised system, retrieving it would be much harder. If, however, data is lost in a distributed system, retrieving it would be very easy, because there is always a copy of the data in a different location of the database. * Designing a centralised database is generally much less complex than designing a distributed database, as distributed database systems are based on a hierarchical structure.

Reduced miR-122 levels are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. miR-122 also plays an important positive role in the regulation of hepatitis C virus replication.  Expression and regulation  miR-122 was originally identified by cloning of tissue-specific microRNAs in mouse, where its expression is restricted to the liver. The liver-specific expression of miR-122 is conserved in zebrafish. miR-122 expression increases during embryogenesis until it constitutes 72% of total miRNA in adult human liver, making it one of the most highly expressed miRNAs in any tissue. In humans, miR-122 is encoded at a single genomic locus in chromosome 18. The primary miR-122 transcript (pri-miR-122) is a long non- coding RNA. Transcription is regulated by HNF4Œ±. The miR-122 hairpin precursor consensus shown here is predicted based on base pairing and cross-species conservation. The mature sequence is excised from the 5‚Ä≤ arm of the hairpin. There is evidence that miR-122 is regulated by Rev-ErbA alpha which is involved in circadian gene expression, suggesting that miR-122 is a circadian metabolic regulator. miR-122 regulates the expression of several mRNA molecules that are important in the circadian cycle, such as PPARŒ≤/Œ¥. Mature miR-122 is subject to modification by the poly(A) polymerase GLD-2, which adds a single adenosine to the miRNA 3‚Ä≤ end. This results in an increase in miR-122 stability.  Targets  miR-122 regulates the synthesis of the protein CAT-1 by binding to sites in the mRNA 3'UTR such that translation is repressed and the mRNA is targeted to P bodies. This repression can be relieved by the protein HuR, which is released from the nucleus under conditions of cell stress and binds to the CAT-1 3'UTR. The HuR interaction leads to release of the mRNA from the P bodies and resumption of active translation. A number of other miR-122 targets, including CD320, AldoA and BCKDK, have been identified by microarray analysis of changes in mRNA expression in the liver of mice treated with miR-122 inhibitors. The overall effect of miR-122 inhibition is to reduce the plasma cholesterol level, although the pathways involved in this regulation have not been fully elucidated. miR-122 also regulates systemic iron homeostasis via the target mRNAs Hjv and Hfe. miR-122 inhibition in mice or primates does not result in any detectable liver toxicity.  Role in cancer  miR-122 levels are frequently reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to normal liver, and low miR-122 levels correlate with poor prognosis. Overexpression of miR-122 reduces tumorigenic properties in HCC cell lines, suggesting that it functions as a tumor suppressor gene, and increases the response of cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs sorafenib and doxorubicin. Several miR-122 target genes have been implicated in tumorigenesis, including ADAM10, IGF1R, CCNG1 and ADAM17. Innate Immunity Recent studies demonstrated that miR-122 may directly regulate different aspects of the interferons (IFNs) signaling pathway to enhanced induction of anti-viral genes and inhibition of various virus. Moreover, miR-122 have been shown to target various genes, resulting in enhancement of IFN signaling and subsequent antiviral innate immunity. Interferons (IFNs, includes type I and III interferon) treatment leads to a significant reduction in the expression of the liver-specific miR-122. HepG2 cells with overexpressed microRNA-122 mount an effective antiviral interferon response and innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV), other RNA viruses and viral mimetics (e.g. poly(I:C)).  Regulation of HCV  Recent studies have shown that replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is dependent on miR-122 expression. miR-122 regulates HCV by binding directly to two adjacent sites close to the 5‚Ä≤ end of HCV RNA. Although these experiments were conducted using genotype 1a and 1b HCV RNA, the miR-122 binding sites are highly conserved across different genotypes, and miR-122 is also required for replication of infectious type 2a HCV. As miRNAs generally function to repress gene expression by binding to 3'UTR sites, this positive regulation of viral replication via a 5'UTR represents a novel function for miR-122. The mechanism of regulation is not yet clear. miR-122 stimulates translation of HCV RNA, but not to a sufficient extent to explain its effects on viral replication, indicating that a second stage of the viral replication cycle must also be regulated. HCV RNA synthesis is not affected by miR-122, suggesting that regulation of other processes such as RNA stability may occur. The extent to which the miRNA- induced silencing complex (miRISC) is involved in this regulation has not been fully determined. The Argonaute proteins (Ago1‚Äì4), which are essential for miRNA-directed repression, appear to be necessary for miR-122 to regulate HCV, although miR-122 overexpression may overcome this requirement. Another miRISC component, the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6, does not play a role in miR-122-facilitated HCV replication. The existing HCV therapy of PEG-IFNŒ± plus ribavirin is poorly tolerated and frequently ineffective, so there is an urgent need for new drugs, and miR-122 inhibitors are an attractive possibility. The association between low miR-122 levels and hepatocellular carcinoma suggests that caution will be necessary when testing miR-122 inhibitors, and that long term treatment might be undesirable. However, miR-122 is a promising target as it can be very selectively and effectively inhibited with antisense oligonucleotides, and as it is a conserved host factor it is hoped that the virus would not be able to acquire resistance mutations to an anti-miR-122 therapeutic. Moreover, engineering HepG2 cells to express miR-122 (HepG2-HFL cell, HepG2 cells expressing miR-122) mount an effective antiviral interferon-lambda (IFNŒª) based innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HepG2 cells (stably expressing miR-122) produced a more robust IFN Response (type I and type III interferons) when challenged with other RNA viruses [ IAV-ŒîNS1 and SeV ] and viral mimetics than Huh-7 and Huh-7.5 cells. HCV Induces an IFN-Œª (IL28 and IL29), ISG, and Cytokine Response in these HepG2 cells with stably expressing miR-122. =Inhibitor miravirsen= As of 2017, Santaris Pharma was developing miravirsen, a locked nucleic acid-based antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits miR-122, as a potential treatment for HepC.  Use as a biomarker  miR-122 has recently been explored as a potential biomarker for various hepatic conditions. A change in levels of miR-122 in the blood has been confirmed as an indicator for viral-, alcohol- and chemical-induced liver injury as well as Transplant rejection after Liver transplantation.Verhoeven, CJ, van der Laan, LJ, de Jonge, J, Metselaar, HJ (2017). Biomarkers to Monitor Graft Function Following Liver Transplantation. Biomarkers in Liver Disease. V. B. Patel and V. R. Preedy. Dordrecht, Springer Netherlands: , page 193‚Äì220. This change is noted before increased amino-transferase activity, making it an early indicator of liver disease and hepatocellular injury of liver grafts prior to liver transplantation. There is a great deal of research into the use of miR-122 as a biomarker for hepatitis C. While some studies dispute its efficacy for diagnosing Hep C, other research indicates that it may be useful in diagnosing specific forms of hepatitis. In addition, decreased levels of miR-122 in liver biopsies have been linked to a strain of hepatitis C that is resistant to interferon therapy. miR-122 has also been suggested as a biomarker for hepatectomy-induced liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. It is important to note that detection of miR-122 and other microRNAs in Body fluid like blood can be interfered by heparin contaminated. The commonly used anticoagulant heparin profoundly inhibits the by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used for microRNA quantification.

The loyal S≈çma clan samurai Tange Samanosuke is attacked and mutilated as the result of a betrayal, losing his right eye and right arm. He then begins to lead the life of a nihilistic ronin, using the pseudonym Sazen. Development Tange Sazen first appeared in a serial by which ran from October 1927 to May 1928 in the Mainichi Shimbun. The story concerned the exploits of ≈åoka Echizen, and Tange Sazen was a minor character. But his strikingly dramatic appearance, with a scar across his right eye and an empty right sleeve, as embodied in illustrations by , so caught the imagination of the public that within a few months three films of Tange's adventures were produced by different companies.

Life Born about 1638, he is said to have been educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, but his name does not appear in the list of admissions.The ODNB has him educated at St John's, and cites Venn's Alumni Cantabrigienses; though the dates given by the ODNB agree with those in Venn, Venn has him educated at Jesus College. See He entered the church, and became rector of Doddington in the Isle of Ely. In 1678 he took the degree of LL.D.:s:Nalson, John (DNB00) Nalson was an active polemical writer on the side of the government during the latter part of the reign of Charles II. The Countermine, published in 1677 quickly went through three editions, and was highly praised by Roger L'Estrange. Published anonymously, its authorship was soon discovered, and the parliament of 1678, in which the opposition, whom he had attacked, had the majority, resolved to call Nalson to account. On 26 March 1678 he was sent for on the charge of having written a pamphlet called A Letter from a Jesuit in Paris, showing the most efficient way to ruin the Government and the Protestant Religion, in which the names of various members of parliament were introduced. After being kept in custody for about a month, he was discharged, but ordered to be put out of the commission of the peace, and to be reprimanded by the speaker (1 May). Nalson then published several other pamphlets, undertook to make a collection of documents in answer to John Rushworth (1682), and printed the Trial of Charles I (1684), prefixing to his historical works long polemical attacks on the whigs. He begged William Sancroft for preferment; he asked on 21 July 1680 for the deanery of Worcester, on 14 August 1680 for the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge, and to be given a prebend either at Westminster or Ely. In 1684 he did receive a prebend at Ely. He died on 24 March 1686, aged 48, and was buried at Ely. Works and collection of papers Nalson's major work is the Impartial Collection of the Great Affairs of State, from the beginning of the Scotch Rebellion in the year 1639 to the murder of King Charles I. The first volume was published in 1682, and the second in 1683, but the collection in fact ends in January 1642. Its avowed object was to serve as an antidote to the similar collection of materials by Rushworth, and the work was undertaken under the special patronage of Charles II. Nalson was allowed free access to various repositories of state papers. From the documents in the office of the clerk of the parliament he was apparently allowed to take almost anything he pleased. He also had access to the Paper Office, to take copies. He applied to the Duke of Ormonde for documents relating to Ireland, and obtained permission to copy some of the papers. Lord Guilford communicated to him extracts from the memoirs of the Earl of Manchester, and he at least planned to obtain help from the Earl of Macclesfield, one of the last survivors of the king's generals. Nalson in these ways brought together a collection of primary sources and original documents illustrating the history of the period between 1638 and 1660. On his death it all remained in the possession of his family. The collection was gradually broken up. Some of the Irish transcripts came into the hands of Thomas Carte, and a considerable number of the parliamentary papers were abstracted by Thomas Tanner. These portions of the collection are in the Bodleian Library. Twenty-two volumes came to Welbeck Abbey; four volumes were purchased by the British Museum in 1846, and four others went missing. Some documents from Nalson's collection were printed by Zachary Grey in his answer to Daniel Neal's History of the Puritans (1737-9), and others by Francis Peck in his Desiderata Curiosa (1735). The Common Interest of King & People (1678) argues for monarchy, but in part on a utilitarian basis. Nalson's only other historical work was A True Copy of the Journal of the High Court of Justice for the Trial of K. Charles I (1684). Nalson is notable for making the claim that Cardinal Richelieu of France was involved in secretly stoking the initial stages of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the unrest of Scottish Covenanters in the Bishops' Wars during the reign of Charles I of England. For Nalson, the motivation for Richelieu to do this (even supporting a Radical Protestant revolt) was to keep England tied down with various domestic divisions so that is could not uphold the balance of power in Europe. He claims that John Pym had in his possession a letter confirming the involvement of Richelieu in these affairs, but chose not to publish it and blame Charles I instead.

Opium poppy straw today can be one of several different things. It is what remains after the poppy seed harvest, that is, the dried stalks, stem and leaves of poppies grown for their seeds. The dried leaves and stalks are harvested after the seed pods have been used for traditional opium extraction. The field dried leaves, stalk and seed pod are used in commercial manufacture of morphine or other poppy alkaloid derived drugs, by first processing the material to make poppy straw separating the seeds then making concentrate of poppy straw, where no extraction using traditional methods of latex extraction has been made. The straw was originally considered an agricultural by-product of the mechanised poppy seed harvest, which was primarily grown for its edible and oil-producing seed. This changed in 1927 when J√°nos Kabay developed a chemical process to extract morphine from the crushed capsule. Concentrated poppy straw consisting mainly of the crushed capsule without the seeds soon became a valuable source of morphine. Today, concentrate of poppy straw is a major source of many opiates and other alkaloids. It is the source of 90% of the world supply of legal morphine (for medical and scientific use) and in some countries it also is a source of illegal morphine, which could be processed into illegal heroin. The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs defines poppy straw as \\"all parts (except the seeds) of the opium poppy, after mowing\\". Decorative Dried Flower producer/growers and wholesalers, hand pick the decorative mature seeded pods/heads with or without the stalks for use as floral decorations for visual gratification in arrangements. These are then mechanically dried at high temperatures in large kilns to render insects dead and the seeds unviable so that the harvest consists almost entirely of the dried flowered seeded pods/heads (for ease of transport, artificial stems are added afterwards, e.g. bird seed wreath making, floral arrangements and wedding boutonni√®res or arts/craft projects). The seeds used for this market are especially chosen for the size and shape of the mature poppy seed pod/head not alkaloid content. Many varieties, strains, and cultivars of Papaver somniferum are in existence, and the alkaloid content can vary significantly. Harvesting Traditional method: fruits are scored Traditional method of harvesting opium by hand, still in use today Modern method; fruits are not scored Modern method: harvesting of poppy straw Traditional harvesting of opium poppies to produce opiates involved the labor-intensive work of making shallow cuts in the immature fruits (seed pods) so that the latex would leak out and dry, then returning the following day to scrape off the dry latex, known as raw opium. Harvesting of poppy straw is an alternative, largely mechanized method. The plants are allowed to mature fully, then a machine is used to harvest the entire field. The ripe poppy seeds are separated out by threshing and winnowing, and the remainder is poppy straw. Poppy straw usually consists of only the above ground parts of the plant, but the roots may be harvested as well. Some producers mow the plants high, so that the harvest consists almost entirely of the fruits (seed pods), omitting the stalks, leaves, and roots. Poppy straw is then processed in a manner similar to opium to extract opiates and other alkaloids (see Morphine). Avoiding the labor-intensive harvesting of opium by hand was the topic of research for almost 100 years. This research was of notable interest in those countries where opium poppy was an important oilseed crop but due to high labor costs the harvesting of opium was not economic. What was needed was a process that enabled commercial extraction of opiates from opium poppies directly rather than from (comparatively pure) opium. By the 1940s, commercial production of morphine from poppy straw had spread from Hungary to Poland and finally most countries where poppies are grown on a large scale primarily for their seeds. By 1950, about 10% of the poppy seed harvest of those countries was also yielding morphine. Based on average yields and the reported production of poppy seed in 9 European countries, the potential production of morphine from those crops was estimated to be . However, in 1950 the actual production of morphine from poppy straw was reported to be . As of 1950, the average annual yield per hectare was estimated to be poppy seed and poppy straw (dry capsule chaff), which in turn was estimated to yield about of morphine (in good years). Processing The first commercial process by which opiates are extracted from poppy straw was invented in Hungary by J√°nos Kabay. This process, known as the \\"poppy straw method\\", remains in use today. Kabay applied his new process initially to fields of opium poppies between the stages of flowering and maturity, while the fruits were green. This had several disadvantages: the immature poppy seeds could not be winnowed, so not only was the seed crop lost but their poppyseed oil interfered with the process; the abundant chlorophyll in the green plants also interfered; and an entire year's crop had to be processed in two months, as it reached the fruit stage. Kabay soon found that the process could be applied to poppy straw residue from the poppy seed harvest, and thereby eliminate all these disadvantages. Poppy straw is first pulverized, then washed as many as six to ten or more times in water which may have an acid added to increase solubility, to produce poppy straw concentrate (PSC, also known as concentrate of poppy straw, CPS). Dried, the concentrate is a beige to brown powder. It contains salts of various alkaloids, and can range from nine to 30 times the morphine concentration of poppy straw. Opium concentrates using solvents other than acidifed or plain water are often but not necessarily called PSC. Poppies of the Norman and Przemko strains contain much higher amounts of thebaine and oripavine and have morphine concentrations down to under 1 per cent. versus up to 26 per cent in high-morphine strains. At least one manufacturer, Tasmanian Alkaloids, produces both high-morphine and high-thebaine/oripavine types of poppy straw concentrate; the latter is used by pharmaceutical manufacturers to make semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids such as oxycodone, etorphine, butorphanol and a number of others. PSC is an alternative to bricks of opium, as an alkaloid source in most but not all of the production methods to isolate natural alkaloids from the opium poppy. A notable exception is thebaine, which is present in far larger fractions in opium than in poppy straw. Morphine, being a large fraction of the alkaloids found in mature poppy capsules, is produced commercially from either opium or concentrated poppy straw. To extract morphine, PSC is dissolved in water and treated with other chemicals to obtain the next intermediate, calcium morphenate or less frequently sodium morphenate, which is then further treated to purify the drug and convert it to the desired morphine salt or base. Processes for extracting other alkaloids, such as codeine and noscapine, use other chemicals and/or optimal solution pH. Poppy straw crops Annual world production of opium and poppy straw, both legal and illegal, is tabulated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and reported in its annual World Drug Report. The quantity of poppy straw produced is typically given as \\"opium equivalents\\". The 2002 World Drug Report estimate of the total world opium production, including opium equivalents of poppy straw, was in 1906/07 and in 2007. The 2007 production consisted of of illegal opium, of opium equivalent from legal poppy straw, and of legal opium. Thus, over 90% of the world production of legal opiates, including medical morphine, now is produced from poppy straw. With the establishment of poppy straw as the source of the majority of natural morphine and other opiates, much of the world production of opium is destined for illicit uses. In 1981 dried capsules were found being sold for decoration in Sweden, that had been lanced 2 to 5 times with a tool having 3 to 4 blades and the opium scraped off. The morphine content of these capsules was 0.15 - 0.34%, comparable to domestic Swedish capsules not lanced. In India, poppy straw from lanced capsules had a morphine content of at least 0.2%. These levels of morphine obtained from \\"exhausted\\" plants suggests that for producers of licit opium, poppy straw may be a profitable second crop. As of 2005, India was the only country producing licit opium (opium gum) for both domestic use and export. Licit opium was produced also in Democratic People's Republic of Korea for domestic use, and Japan for maintenance of the pertinent technology (small quantities). Opium poppies were grown principally for extraction of alkaloids (from poppy straw) in 9 other countries: Australia, China, France, Hungary, Slovakia, Spain, the Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. China ceased producing licit opium after 2001. Opium poppies grown principally for the seed crop, with licit poppy straw as a by-product, were produced in the Czech Republic, Serbia and Montenegro. Another 6 countries cultivated opium poppies solely for the poppy seed or horticultural purposes, without extraction of alkaloids from poppy straw: Austria, Estonia, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, and Ukraine. Illicit production of Polish heroin and other products derived from poppy straw is an ongoing problem in Poland, although it isn't as serious as in the 1980s, after poppies containing high levels of opioid alkaloids were banned in 1990s. The production of licit opium in India was in accord with terms of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. After the opium was harvested, the plants were allowed to mature and harvested for poppy seeds. The sale of poppy seeds delivered a significant proportion of the income from the licit opium crop. Unknown fractions of both the opium harvest and poppy straw residue of the poppy seed harvest were diverted to illicit uses. The production of illegal opium from poppy straw is limited. It is reported primarily in clandestine laboratories in Moldova, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, using domestic poppy straw. Derived products A common method of producing laudanum involves dissolving the PSC or latex-derived opium in alcohol and either being allowed to sit for up to a week and periodically agitated, using fresh alcohol to do multiple washes, or refluxing. The original patents for laudanum in various countries refer to soaking poppy straw in varying levels of pulverisation in plain water for a week then evaporating the water to obtain the gummy or powdery brown concentrate. Recreational use Poppy tea and its variants can be said to be an incomplete and/or relatively crude form of PSC aqueous solution. Home-made poppy straw extracts including Kompot are widely used among IV drug users in eastern Europe, including Ukraine and Poland. Tracing of illicit drugs Poppy straw is a raw material from which illegal heroin may be produced. The alkaloid profiles of poppy straw and opium are similar, but preliminary research suggests they can be distinguished by relative quantities of alkaloids. Based on the presence of the alkaloid oripavine in some opium poppies, it has been suggested that illegal heroin seized in Australia was produced from a legal poppy straw crop stolen in Tasmania a few years earlier.

This strip was stated in the book The History of The Beano: The Story So Far as originally having the name The Ultras in the planning stages, and was inspired by the X-Men. The strip originally features four super powered children (which later became five) and their non-super powered Teacher. The pupils are Invisible Isobel, who as the name suggests can turn invisible; Safari Sam, a shapeshifter who can become any animal; Stinkbomb, who can create any aroma; Waterboy, who as the name suggests can control water (like the Marvel Comics villain Hydroman). During the comic strips run the class gained a new pupil Bananagirl, who is described by The Beano as \\"like Bananaman, only shorter\\". She can fly and is super strong, just like The Dandy's superhero. It was revealed on the Beano website that Bananagirl is Bananaman's niece,http://www.beano.com/characters/super-school/cast/super- school-bananagirl however, the comic itself has since contradicted this, instead saying that she is his cousin. In early strips, they were learning to use their abilities, but now most strips see them go on a mission, although sometimes these are just to help out Teacher. After a hiatus throughout much of 2011, it has been confirmed by the strip's artist Lew Stringer that it will return to the comic in the near future. A one-off strip in January 2012 heralded Bananaman's arrival to the Beano.

This was a method used in pharmaceutical manufacturing to separate morphine from other alkaloids and inert materials from the opium solution. Variations on this route are still used in Afghanistan. When poppy straw concentrate or opium latex is dissolved in hot water and the calcium base is added, calcium morphenate is formed. Treatment with a weak acid such as ammonium chloride then causes morphine freebase to precipitate, leaving codeine and other alkaloids of the plant in solution.

The site was previously home to old mixed-use buildings. All former residents were evicted. The URA partners with private developers to carry out redevelopment projects. On 22 July 2004, the project was awarded to Nan Fung Development, who beat out eight other developers. Features The estate has three residential blocks offering a total of 522 flats. It also includes a children's-themed shopping centre called \\"West 9 Zone\\". Hoi Ming Court incident There is a residential block called \\"Hoi Ming Court\\" in the middle of the construction site of the Cherry Street Project, but Hoi Ming Court was excluded from the redevelopment project due to its young age. Nan Fung Development, one of the project's property developers, tried to acquire the block for the whole redevelopment. However, both Nan Fung and URA thought that the acquisition cost raised by flat owners was too high and finally gave up the acquisition plan.

It was founded in 1989 by Nigel Townsend. The company was based in Kings Cross, London, England and was a former operation of Central YMCA. In 2014 Y Touring Theatre Company was closed. The company is now extending the work through digital media.  Y Touring Theatre Company history  Y Touring produced 54 regional, national and international tours of plays by professional playwrights including Judith Johnson, Judy Upton, Jonathan Hall, Nicola Baldwin and Rhiannon Tise, reportedly reaching over 2 million young people in schools, youth clubs, community venues, studio theatres, prisons and young offenders centres. Y Touring's first production was 'The Inner Circle' by Patricia Loughrey, originally commissioned by The New Conservatory Theatre Centre in San Francisco, adapting it for British young people‚Äôs audiences. This play told the story of a group of four friends, one of whom had been infected by HIV and went on to develop AIDS and die.  Theatre of Debate  Y Touring's projects generally followed a 'Theatre of Debate' model. Each project consists of a play aiming to engage its audience in an informed debate about a specific subject. The play is followed by a live debate between the actors (who remain in character) and the audience.

Here the process is a discrete-time Markov chain of order m and the transition probability to a state at the next time is a sum of functions, each depending on the next state and one of the m previous states. Definition An additive Markov chain of order m is a sequence of random variables X1, X2, X3, ..., possessing the following property: the probability that a random variable Xn has a certain value xn under the condition that the values of all previous variables are fixed depends on the values of m previous variables only (Markov chain of order m), and the influence of previous variables on a generated one is additive, :\\\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\\\dots, X_{n-m}=x_{n-m}) = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{m} f(x_n,x_{n-r},r). Binary case A binary additive Markov chain is where the state space of the chain consists on two values only, Xn ‚àà { x1, x2 }. For example, Xn ‚àà { 0, 1 }. The conditional probability function of a binary additive Markov chain can be represented as : \\\\Pr(X_n=1\\\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\\\dots) = \\\\bar{X} + \\\\sum_{r=1}^{m} F(r) (x_{n-r}-\\\\bar{X}), : \\\\Pr(X_n=0\\\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\\\dots) = 1 - \\\\Pr(X_n=1\\\\mid X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, X_{n-2} = x_{n-2}, \\\\dots). Here \\\\bar{X} is the probability to find Xn = 1 in the sequence and F(r) is referred to as the memory function. The value of \\\\bar{X} and the function F(r) contain all the information about correlation properties of the Markov chain. =Relation between the memory function and the correlation function= In the binary case, the correlation function between the variables X_n and X_k of the chain depends on the distance n - k only. It is defined as follows: :K(r) = \\\\langle (X_n-\\\\bar{X})(X_{n+r}-\\\\bar{X}) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle X_n X_{n+r} \\\\rangle -{\\\\bar{X}}^2, where the symbol \\\\langle \\\\cdots \\\\rangle denotes averaging over all n. By definition, :K(-r)=K(r), K(0)=\\\\bar{X}(1-\\\\bar{X}). There is a relation between the memory function and the correlation function of the binary additive Markov chain:S.S. Melnyk, O.V.

He was prominent in the affairs of the Royal Agricultural Society and owner of a prize-winning herd of short-horn cattle. He served as a Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for the Riding from 1832 to 1841, after which he sat in the House of Lords, having succeeded to the title on the death of his father. From 1826 to 1831 he had sat as an Ultra-Tory MP. He was the first MP to support Richard Oastler's campaign for Factory Reform, and gave it unwavering support for the rest of his life; in 1847 he seconded the Second Reading in the Lords of the Factory Act of that year (the 'Ten-Hour Act'). Background Feversham was the eldest son of Charles Duncombe (subsequently (1826) created Baron Feversham), and Lady Charlotte, daughter of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth. He was born at the family's town house in London (their country seat was at Duncombe Park, just outside Helmsley in the North Riding). He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1820, he was commissioned as a cornet in the Helmsley Yeomanry Cavalry; in 1821 he qualified as a Justice of the peace for the North Riding; by 1826, however, he was living near Doncaster. His younger brothers included the Hon. Arthur Duncombe and the Hon. Octavius Duncombe. Public life When the colourful Radical MP Thomas Slingsby Duncombe died in 1861, it was noted in a piece appearing in a number of newspapers that > The most comical contrast to Tom Duncombe was his cousin, the present Lord > Feversham, a heavy, solid, goodnatured man, whose speeches are of the most > ponderous and soporific character - \\"a man whose talk is of bullocks\\" and > whose opinions were of the extreme Conservative and Protectionist colour. =Agriculturalist= When Faversham talked of bullocks, he did so as one of the leading breeders and exhibitors of short-horn cattle; animals from the Duncombe Park herd won prizes at Smithfield, at the Royal Agricultural Show, and at the Paris International Exposition of 1855, although he came to deplore the prevalence of judging criteria which led to prizes going to animals which had been over-fattened, to the detriment of their health and that of the breed. He was deeply involved with the Royal Agricultural Society, serving as its president in 1863‚Äì4,\\"at once a sound practical agriculturist and a pleasant and agreeable chairman\\" and with the Smithfield Show Club (president in 1862)\\"Lord Feversham, though he has, and makes no pretensions to oratory, is an excellent president; while his merits as an owner of stock qualify him to pronounce opinions suitable to such an occasion\\" as well as local and county agricultural shows. His final parliamentary speech was (in 1866) an attack on the inadequacy of the government's response to the current cattle plague outbreak:: he had previously been part of a deputation from the council of the Royal Agricultural Society which had pressed the government to suspend cattle markets except where stock were immediately slaughtered =Political views= Duncombe was a Tory; seconding the Loyal Address in 1822, he said that \\"the constitution stood so firm on its basis, was so beautifully connected in all its parts, and was so admirably adapted to all classes of society, that it was impossible but that all who enjoyed the blessing of living under it should perceive its advantages over any other system of government.\\" Consequently, Duncombe was opposed to the great liberal causes of his time (Catholic emancipation, parliamentary reform, abolition of the corn laws) but he did not seek to reverse them. When the Duke of Wellington decided that Catholic emancipation had to be conceded, Duncombe remained opposed to any measure of Catholic emancipation; once the measure was passed he accepted it was irreversible, but remained unreconciled to those who had granted it (an 'ultra-Tory'). =Factory Reform= Duncombe rarely spoke in Parliament, other than to present petitions. However, he gave his moral support to (and exerted himself on behalf of) the Factory Reform movement; when Richard Oastler wrote to MPs in 1831 seeking their support, Duncombe was the only one to reply. Duncombe spoke at the great York Factory Reform meeting of 1832, despite his concern that his past political activity would taint the cause: he stressed 'this is not the cause of party.. It is the cause of justice .. It is the cause of real humanity, of Christian benevolence ... it is the cause of the oppressed and the industrious poor' One of his rare parliamentary speeches was to second the Second Reading of the 1847 Factory Act (the Ten-Hour Act). He spoke in favour of a \\"bona fide ten-hours\\" amendment to the Factories Bill of 1850 (the Compromise Act), and also voted to include \\"children\\" in the provisions of the bill. in the week of his death, a letter from him offering his support for agitation for an eight-hour act was read out by the chairman of a meeting in Manchester. On Feversham's death in 1867, the Yorkshire Post noted that Oastler had \\"constantly alluded to the unfailing support he received from Lord Feversham in battling with the opponents of the bill as his principal mainstay and encouragement in the work they had undertaken\\" =Opposition to the Poor Law Commission= Like Oastler, he opposed the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834: he voted against its Third Reading (but he had been absent from all of the committee stage proceedings). Debating the Whig Poor Law Amendment Bill of 1841 (intended to extend the life of the Poor Law Commission for five years) he denounced the 1834 Act: \\"It was a measure which made poverty a crime; which incarcerated men who were guilty of no other crime but misery and distress, in gaols and dungeons; which cut asunder the dearest ties of human nature, fathers from their children, husbands from their wives; and it was a measure in his belief calculated more than any other to alienate the feelings of the people from the laws and institutions of their country, and upon these grounds he was determined to give it his strenuous and uncompromising opposition.\\"speech (attributed to 'Mr W. Buncombe') at cc 645-6 in In the subsequent committee stage of the bill he repeatedly voted for amendments returning powers from the Poor Law Commission to the local guardians- most notably he was teller for an amendment removing the supervisory powers of the commission: his one recorded vote against an amendment to the bill was against one making borrowing by guardians dependent on prior approval by a vestry meeting. =Support for Richard Oastler= His support of Oastler was not only political but personal. In 1838, he presented a petition from Huddersfield supporting the refusal of its magistrates to call out the military to suppress anti-Poor Law disturbances in which Oastler had been prominent. In 1840 he intervened in a Commons debate to obtain the retraction of a description of Oastler as an incendiary by a government minister. He visited Oastler in debtors' prison, and was a trustee of the Oastler Testimonial Fund (later the Oastler Liberation Fund), and prominent in raising the money to secure the release of Oastler (being one of the guarantors who met the shortfall in the money raised to satisfy Oastler's creditor). =Career as MP= In 1820 he stood with and was elected with Charles Tennyson Member of Parliament for the two-member borough constituency of Great Grimsby. Tennyson asserted his constituents had represented to him the need for both members for the seat to hold similar views; acceding to their wishes he had selected Duncombe as his running mate.letter signed \\"Charles Tennyson, Park-street, Westminster 26th February 1820\\" printed as advertisement Duncombe admitted to having no prior connection with the constituency but promised to assiduously promote its interestsletter signed \\"William Duncombe, Duncombe Park 24th February 1820\\" printed as advertisement In 1825 Duncombe was called upon to stand for election as a 'firm upholder of the Protestant cause' (opponent of Catholic emancipation) in the prestigious four-member county constituency of Yorkshire.letter signed 'Amicus', printed as Duncombe acceded to the requisition and stood for Yorkshire, rather than Grimsby.untitled paragraph under general heading On election day in June 1826 only four candidates (two Whig, two 'no Popery' Tories) were nominated, and therefore all (including Duncombe) were elected unopposed. Catholic emancipation split the Tories, and the Ultras (including Duncombe) withdrew their support from the government. In 1830, when Duncombe stood again for Yorkshire, Henry Brougham, a Whig-Radical standing in the same constituency said of him > Mr Duncombe is a man from whom I differ. I differed from him in respect of > the Test acts and on the Catholic Bill. But we have sat in Parliament two > years on the same benches, and I declare to you I never saw a man whose > conduct did him more honour, or who was more perfectly independent.

Unlike the election of 1826 they were not immediately elected: this time a fifth candidate nominated himself and demanded a poll, The fifth candidate having received a mere handful of votes by the end of the first day of polling, the poll was closed on the second day, at which point Duncombe was third (behind the two Whig candidates). The four remaining candidates were therefore declared elected. In the 1831 general election, Duncombe was again requisitioned to stand: he accepted the invitation, but withdrew before the actual poll, it being clear that Reform candidates would take all four seats.advertisements: In the reformed parliament, there were separate two-member county constituencies for each of the three ridings of Yorkshire. Duncombe stood in the North Riding of Yorkshire as the sole Tory candidate. In December 1832 he headed the poll ahead of two competing Reformers; John Charles Ramsden (supported by the Whig grandees) a West Riding industrialist and former Whig MP for Yorkshire, and Edward Stillingfleet Cayley, an independent of Liberal sympathies who farmed locally and put himself forward as a friend of the interests of small agriculturalists: Cayley took the second seat.see report of Cayley's victory speech in In the election of January 1835 the constituency was contested by the two sitting MPs and a second Tory: despite (it was alleged) the Tories freely opening their purses the two MPs were reelected: at a November 1835 meeting they agreed that their first concern was to protect agricultural interests, regardless of party labels. They were returned unopposed in 1837, and again in 1841, but ten days after Duncome's re-election in 1841 election his father died, and Duncombe took his seat in the House of Lords: in the consequent by-election Duncombe's brother Octavius was elected unopposed. =Parliamentary proprietor= From 1832 to 1881, when Feversham's grandson Viscount Helmsley died, the North Riding always returned one Duncombe or another as one of its MPs. Usually, the other MP was a Liberal; an 1862 by- election which briefly gave the riding two Conservative MPs saw this analysis from a Liberal newspaper: \\"Lord Feversham is a great Parliamentary proprietor. He keeps several seats in the House of Commons, at great expense and with jealous care; and very naturally he does as he will with his own. When one of his Parliamentary saddles is vacant a relative usually has the preference. Three of the favoured family happen just now to be thus mounted. Nobody ever hears of them in the legislative field; but who has any right to ask a question? By the law of the land the head of the House of Duncombe has the might to be represented in the Lower House of Parliament by three of his immediate kinsmen, and in our electoral system might is right.\\"untitled paragraph beginning Marriage and children Memorial to Albert (1826-1846) in the Church of All Saints, Helmsley Lord Feversham married, in 1823, Lady Louisa Stewart, the youngest daughter of Admiral George Stewart, 8th Earl of Galloway. They had six children. He died in February 1867, aged 69, and was succeeded by his son, William Ernest, who was created Earl of Feversham the following year. Lady Feversham died in March 1889.

The college, is one of the oldest law colleges in the country. Established in 1875 by the then Maharajah of the erstwhile Princely State of Travancore, the college has produced some of the finest legal minds, including Indian Supreme Court Judges, more than half a dozen sitting Judges of the Kerala High Court, Union Ministers/legislators, academicians, bureaucrats etc. The first woman Judge of the Supreme Court Justice Fathima Beevi is an alumnus of the college, so also noted academician N. R. Madhava Menon. History The government of His Highness Maharaja of Travancore on 31 January 1875 sanctioned \\"the Organisation of a Law Class in connection with His Highness College at Thiruvananthapuram to enable candidates from Travancore to present themselves for the Law Examination of the University of Madras and to encourage others to pursue the study of Law systematically\\". The order sanctioning the scheme directed that it shall be worked on the same lines as the Class attached to the Presidency College at Madras. Mr. W. E. Ormsby, Barrister-at-law, then a Judge of Sadur Court of Travancore was appointed Professor of Law in His Highness the Maharajas College. He opened the class on 9 February of the same year. In 1877, His Highness College was affiliated to the University of Madras in the Faculty of Law. The class was thus continued till 1894 when in conformity with important alterations in the by-laws of the Madras University regarding the B.L. Degree Examination, the institution was re-organised on an entirely different footing. The Law Class which till then was working as a part of His Highness College and the Professors whereof were treated as members of that College was raised to the status of an independent College under the designation of \\"His Highness Maharaja's Law College, Thiruvananthapuram\\". A complete set of rules was also sanctioned by the Government for the control and regulation of work in the college. The rules prescribed the qualification required for the members of the teaching staff. The Law College was maintained by His Highness Government and the management of the college was vested in the Principal acting directly under the orders of Dewan of Travancore till the end of 1908. In 1909 the College was placed under the Director of Public Instruction and in 1910 it was placed under the control of the High Court. With the inauguration of University of Travancore in 1938, the College was transferred to the control and supervision of the University. In August 1949 the college was shifted to Ernakulam to fit in with the new set up arising out of the integration of erstwhile State of Travancore- Cochin and the location of the High Court of the united State at Eranakulam.

The foundation of the new party took place in November 1990. Nikolay Lysenko, Stepan Sulakshin and Vyacheslav Shostakovsky were elected as the three co-chairman. The Republican Party joined the Democratic Russia bloc, an umbrella organisation of pro- democracy movements. The Republican Party was close to the Social Democratic Party of Russia, that was founded earlier in 1990. The two parties shared similar program and there were attempts to merge. The Republican Party's program has been characterised as liberal and pragmatic; similarly to the Social Democratic Party, however, the Republican Party had internal factions: ranging from social democracy to social liberal to liberal conservative. 2005‚Äì2012 party logo The RPR and the SDP formed a united faction (–û–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞ –†–ü–†–§/–°–î–ü–†) in the Russian Congress of People's Deputies (later, they fused with similar groups to form the faction 'Left Centre', which was pro-reform but more moderate than groups like the 'Radical Democrats', which advocated radical economic reforms). In contrast to the social democrats, the Republicans participated in the Movement of Democratic Reforms that was formed in summer, 1991 and included mostly liberal-minded former nomeklatura members (Alexander Yakovlev, Gavriil Popov et al.). The Republican Party initially supported both Yegor Gaidar's economic reforms and Boris Yeltsin in his conflict with the Supreme Soviet; later, some of the leaders turned more critical of Yeltsin. The Republican Party left the Democratic Russia bloc in October, 1993 due to disagreements with the bloc's policies. The party members won altogether 12 seats in the newly elected parliament in 1993: 5 republicans within the Yabloko bloc and 7 from Democratic Choice of Russia. In the 1995 legislative election, party ran within the Pamfilova ‚Äî Gurev ‚Äî N.Lysenko bloc, that failed to cross the 5% barrier. Lysenko and Ella Pamfilova won seat through majoritarian district. At the end of 1998, Nikolay Lysenko, retaining the post of RP chairman, joined Yuri Luzhkov's Otechestvo bloc, whereas a number of the regional organisations of the Republican Party cooperated with small liberal parties like Right Cause or Sergey Kiriyenko's New Force etc. In 1999, Lysenko won a parliament seat in a majoritarian district. In 2002, the party was reorganized into the Republican Party of Russia.http://www.panorama.ru/works/vybory/party/rprf.html = Dissolution and re-establishment (2007‚Äì2011) = The first meeting of the coalition of democratic forces \\"For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption\\" in Moscow on Bolotnaya Square on 9 October 2010 In 2007, the Russian Supreme Court ruled the party to be dissolved, according to Ryzhkov because of the opposition to the government. In 2011 the European Court of Human Rights ruled out the refusal to register the party was unlawful. Since 5 May 2012, the Justice Ministry has restored the state registration of the Republican Party of Russia. In 2006‚Äì2010, the RPR was a member of coalition \\"The Other Russia\\". Since 2010 it is a member of the liberal coalition \\"For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption\\" and a member of non-registered People's Freedom Party based on this coalition. People's Freedom Party will continue to work on the base of Republican Party and it may be renamed. In 2011, party's dissolution was held to be unlawful by the European Court of Human Rights. In January 2012, following the entry into force of the ECtHR‚Äôs judgment, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed its 2007 decision to dissolve the party.–í–° –†–§ –æ—Ç–º–µ–Ω–∏–ª —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ –ª–∏–∫–≤–∏–¥–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. http://rapsinews.ru = Merger and recent elections (2011‚Äìpresent) = The Ministry of Justice recognized the merger of the Republican Party and the People's Freedom Party (RPR‚ÄìPARNAS) on 2 August 2012, after the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the party should be restored in May of that year, and it supported the 2011‚Äì13 Russian protests, although since then the party has been mostly on the decline in influence among opposition circles.RPR- PARNAS Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party.

Among the main principles of the PARNAS party program are securing the individual rights of Russian citizens and equality of all before law, and that the government should be democratic, controlled by the public and should serve the interest of the people. The party condemns the Bolsheviks who seized power in 1917 and the existence of the Soviet Union, which it considers tyrannical, and models itself after the Constitutional Democratic Party that existed during the late Russian Empire. It also promises to declassify all KGB and other Soviet documents as part of a \\"decommunization\\" program and ban all promotion of the communist regime. For Russia's form of government it proposes to create a parliamentary republic and increase local self-governance.

Beginning in musical burlesques, she later played in contemporary drama and English classics. Although she was well-known on the London stage from 1869 to 1881, she is probably best remembered today for creating roles in three of W. S. Gilbert's early works. Early life and career Fowler was born in Rochdale, the daughter of a cabinet-maker, Samuel Matthew Fowler, and his wife Sophia n√©e Fox. She took her stage name, Emily, in honor of her grandmother. She had three siblings, Clarissa, Sophia and Samuel. Her family moved to London before 1860, when her father died. As a teen, Fowler appeared in music hall.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"'Putting Emily in order: W S Gilbert's forgotten lady producer\\", Kurt of Gerolstein, 11 June 2018 In 1867, she joined the Royalty Theatre as a chorister and was soon made a replacement in the breeches role of Gnatbrain in F. C. Burnand's long-running musical burlesque of Black-Eyed Susan.Adams, William Davenport. A Dictionary of the Drama, London: Chatto & Windus (1904) pp. 339, 453, 545 and 567 The same year she married John Frederick Fenner, a chorister at the Royalty. The union did not last long, and both parties later married bigamously; he died in 1877. She soon created another burlesque breeches role at the Royalty, Florestein, in W. S. Gilbert's The Merry Zingara (1868). Peak career In 1869, at the Gaiety Theatre, she created the role of Alice in Gilbert's Robert the Devil (1869) and also played Butts (a maid) in the companion piece, a play, On the Cards. There she also originated the roles of Paraquita (\\"Queen of Kokatouka\\") in Columbus (1869).Hollingshead, John. My Lifetime, (1895) S. Low, Marston Now aged 22, Fowler took over the management of the Charing Cross Theatre for the 1869‚Äì1870 season. There she played Mephistopheles in a new burlesque, Very Little Faust and More Mephistopheles (1869) and starred as the hero, Hassan, in a burlesque by Arthur O'Neil of Arabian KnightsAdams, William Davenport. A Book of Burlesque, Sketches of English Stage Travestie and Parody, p. 95, Read Books (2008) and several more plays and burlesques, some by Wybert Reeve. The theatre historian Kurt G√§nzl speculates that Reeve was Fowler's financial backer. She also originated the leading part of Hans in the last piece of the season, The Gentleman in Black, a comic opera written in 1870, with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert and music by Frederic Clay., p. 79 Later in 1870 she played in Free Labour by Charles Reade at the Adelphi TheatreBlanchard, Edward L., et al. The life and reminiscences of E. L.

(1891) and at Christmas, she starred at the Olympic Theatre as Prince Lardi Dardi in a pantomime of The White Cat. She began to build a reputation in drama playing, for example, Kate Bertram in The Rights of Woman.Sherson, Erroll. London's lost theatres of the nineteenth century, London: John Lane (1925), pp. 106‚Äì08 In 1871, she toured with Henry Neville in Dion Boucicault's Elfie, playing Rosie Aircastle and Sam Willoughby in The Ticket-of-Leave Man. In 1872 she was Alfonzo in a burlesque of Zampa at the Royal Court Theatre. With Neville's company in 1873 at the Olympic, she played Florence in Mystery, Kate in Sour Grapes, Martha Gibbs in All That Glitters and Suzanne in The School for Intrigue, an adaptation of The Marriage of Figaro. The next season at the Olympic, she was Lady Betty Noel in Lady Clancarty by Tom Taylor and Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. Rutland Barrington, who appeared with Fowler in Lady Clancarty, called her \\"one of the most delightful soubrettes that ever graced the stage\\"., pp. 16 and 18 In 1875 she played Deborah in The Spendthrift and May Edwards, the heroine, in The Ticket-of-Leave Man. She also portrayed Louise in The Two Orphans at the Olympic. Around this time Fowler wed John Callin Pemberton, the son of the actress Amy Sedgwick. She had never divorced her husband, however, and the marriage ended in 1879 on the grounds of illegality. At the Queen's Theatre in 1876, she was Princess Katherine in Henry V. This was followed by a season at the St James's Theatre. In 1878, she played the title role in W. G. Wills's Nell Gwynne under her own management at the Royalty, and the Viscountess Lidesdale in Scandal at the same theatre, followed by Perdita in A Winter's Tale at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. At the Haymarket Theatre in 1879 she played in Ellen; or Love's Cunning. That year she also appeared in The Gay Deceivers at the Royalty. She also toured during this period and played in As You Like It with Neville. Last years Fowler married a third time, in 1880, to a Captain (later Major) Walter Latham Cox, who appears to have been quartered in Oxfordshire for a time. In 1881 she joined Henry Irving's company to play Emily de L'Esparre in a revival of The Corsican Brothers at the Lyceum Theatre. Then, for more than a decade Fowler disappeared from the London stage. She seems to have been in China, from where she returned to Britain in 1894 to play Lady Winifred Skipton in An Aristocratic Alliance, an adaptation of Le Gendre de M. Poirier, at the Criterion Theatre for Charles Wyndham. She is not known to have returned to the stage. She died in Shoreditch in the June quarter, 1897, around her 50th birthday.
