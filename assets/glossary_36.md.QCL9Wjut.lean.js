Megan, born 1952 in Bristol, England) is now retired, having been a computer software professional since 1968, a career spanning 46 years. He began this career working on early core memory computers such as the LEO Computers LEO III (a room-sized machine that used only switches for control and ferrite rods for memory) to working at Netscape as the System Test Engineering Manager for more recent internet technology products such as Netscape's Directory Server (NDS). Stu emigrated to Canada in 1979, working for a company called GEAC as a system programmer/developer. GEAC built their own hardware and software systems, compilers and were a leading Canadian corporation. Stu then emigrated to the US with GEAC and worked on many system developer projects there. After working at First Interstate IT Services, he moved to Silicon Valley working at many companies including Syntelligence - an Stanford AI company, both in the US and back in UK, he worked for Netscape as Senior QA Manager on Directory Server ( the birth of the internet ) and more. He subsequently began his own QA TestLab Services Consulting Service, initially providing hands on testing and later becoming a QA infrastructure service for small businesses who needed to start their own internal QA. This involved building the environment and then acquiring the resources needed ( people, software, hardware). Stu (Stewart) also worked in the computer game industry for several years, including Sierra's INN network and later Microprose/Spectrum Holobyte where he is credited with working on several games. In his spare time, he has been involved in volunteering on social projects. One of these was the Spacewatch project in Arizona. His time there involved searching for Near Earth Asteroids. Stu also created and ran a supplemental support site, fmogroup.org for the volunteers on the project. By analyzing online images, he discovered among others, the close-approaching asteroids 2004 BV18 on January 19, 2004 and 2004 UH1 on October 23, 2004. He analysed over 10,000 online images during his time on the project and discovered 5 asteroids of note. In July 2004, the asteroid designated 15462 Stumegan was named 'stumegan' in honor of Stewart A Megan's discovery work at the Spacewatch FMO project. The citation states Stewart A. Megan (b. 1952) discovered the Near Earth Object 2004 BV18 in conjunction with the Spacewatch Fast-Moving-Object Project. This find, made using real-time images transferred to volunteers over the Internet, was the subject of much press coverage encouraged others to join the online search. In February 2014, Stu Megan retired after 46 years in the industry, due to health and family issues, which made it impossible for him to continue his business. He is currently working on two novels in his new career as a writer.

Rapoport was known by an acronym \\"Shir\\", ◊©◊ô\\"◊® occasionally ◊©◊ô◊ú\\"◊®, formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name \\"Sh\\"elomo \\"Y\\"ehuda \\"R\\"apoport. Shir literally means \\"song\\" in Hebrew. He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement. Life He was born in Lemberg, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. His father, Rabbi Aharon Hayim Rappaport was a renowned scholar, and his primary teacher. Rappaport was also recognized as an illui. See the Hebrew Wikipedia's :He: ◊©◊ú◊û◊î ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î ◊®◊§◊§◊ï◊®◊ò He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller, the daughter of the well-known Aryeh Leib Heller. He died in Prague. After various experiences in business, Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol (1837) and of Prague (1840). He had been \\"thrown upon his own resources\\" about 1817, and became the collector of the meat-tax on farmers. Because of his work on Saadia Gaon, see below, he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained \\"many enthusiastic friends\\", especially S. D. Luzzatto,Bernfeld, Toledot Shir, p. 33. leading to his appointment as Rabbi. Works He was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law. He wrote both the index, sources and numerous comments. His chief work was the first part of an (unfinished) encyclopaedia \\"Erekh Millin\\", 1852. Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon, Nathan ben Jehiel (author of the Arukh), Hai Gaon, Eleazar Kalir, and others. His early writings were poems and translations. Thereafter his publications showed \\"evidence of marked critical ability\\". In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha-'Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia. His work on Saadia Gaon and his times was published in the same journal in 1829, the first of a series of his biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages. = Ten Sephirot as vowel sounds = Solomon Judah L√∂b Rapoport notes that according to the Masoretes there are ten vowel sounds. He suggests that the passage in the Sefer Yetzirah, which discusses the manipulation of letters in the creation of the world, can be better understood if the Sephirot refer to vowel sounds. He posits that the word sephirah in this case is related to the Hebrew word (\\"to retell\\"). His position is based on his belief that most Kabbalistic works written after Sefer Yetzirah (including the Zohar) are forgeries.

Dokkaebi, also known as \\"Korean goblins\\", are nature deities or spirits possessing extraordinary powers and abilities that are used to interact with humans, at times playing tricks on them and at times helping them. Legends describe different dokkaebi in many forms, and dokkaebi often wear hanbok. Origins The earliest known documentation of dokkaebi is in the Silla-era tale of \\"Lady Dohwa and Bachelor Bihyeong\\" from the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms compiled during the Goryeo period. Dokkaebi are featured in many folk tale anthologies compiled during the Joseon period. Characteristics Dokkaebi are different from ghosts, called gwisin () in Korean, in that they are not formed by the death of a human being, but rather by the spiritual possession of an inanimate object such as old discarded household tools like brooms, or objects stained with human blood. The physical appearance of the dokkaebi is presented in many different ways and has varied by different time periods, but they have always been depicted as fearsome and awe-inspiring. The most common depiction of them is based on ancient roof tiles with dokkaebi patterns. Different versions of the dokkaebi mythology assign different attributes to them. In some cases, they are considered harmless but nevertheless mischievous, usually playing pranks on people or challenging wayward travelers to a ssireum (Korean wrestling) match for the right to pass. Dokkaebi are extremely skilled at wrestling and cannot be beaten unless their right side is exploited. In other tales, dokkaebi only have one leg, so one should hook their leg and push them to win. Dokkaebi fire is a glimmering light or tall blue flames that herald the appearance of dokkaebi. Dokkaebi possess magical items, such as the dokkaebi hat called the (ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ Í∞êÌà¨), which grants the wearer the ability of invisibility, and the dokkaebi magic club called the dokkaebi bangmangi (ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ Î∞©ÎßùÏù¥), which can summon things and act functionally as a magic wand. Dokkaebi likes Buckwheat jelly, Sorghum and red bean rice cake, mashed Sorghum and the drinks. So in dokkaebi gosa (Hangul: ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ Í≥†ÏÇ¨), there are food which Dokkaebi likes. Rituals Dokkaebi have immense supernatural powers, can bring good harvests, big catches and great fortunes to humans, and are defenders against evil spirits. Rituals are held to appeal to dokkaebi to bring benefit to humans. Some communities hold rituals to chase away dokkaebi, who are thought to be the causes of fires and contagious diseases. In Jeju Island, the Durin-gut healing ceremony for mental illnesses often drives away a dokkaebi from the patient.  Legends  Most Korean legends have Dokkaebi in the stories. They are about Dokkaebi playing pranks on mortals or punishing them because of their evil deeds. One of them is about an old man who lived alone in a mountain when a Dokkaebi visited his house. With surprise, the kind old man gave the Dokkaebi an alcoholic beverage and they become friends. The Dokkaebi visited the old man often and they had long conversations together, but one day, the man took a walk by himself in the woods near the river and discovered that his reflection looked like the Dokkaebi. With fear, he realized that he was gradually becoming that creature. The man made a plan to prevent himself from becoming a Dokkaebi and invited the creature to his house. He asked, \\"What are you most afraid of?\\" and the Dokkaebi answered, \\"I'm afraid of blood. What are you afraid of?\\" The man pretended to be frightened and said, \\"I'm afraid of money. That's why I live in the mountains by myself.\\" The next day, the old man killed a cow and poured its blood all over his house. The Dokkaebi, with shock and great anger, ran away and said, \\"I'll be back with your greatest fear!\\" The next day, the Dokkaebi brought bags of money and threw it to the old man. After that, Dokkaebi never came back and the old man became the richest person in the town.  Kinds  Although Dokkaebis have no actual form, some people divide them into types. These are some common types: * Cham dokkaebi (; literally really dokkaebi): A mischievous dokkaebi. Contrast with gae dokkaebi. * Gae dokkaebi (; literally wild dokkaebi): Evil dokkaebi. Contrast with Cham Dokkaebi. * Gim Seobang dokkaebi (; literally Mr. Kim Dokkaebi): A dumb dokkaebi that looks like a farmer. * Nat dokkaebi (; literally day dokkaebi): Unlike other , these appear during the daylight. They are known to give to humans. * Go dokkaebi (; literally high dokkaebi): Dokkaebi known to be good at fighting and handling weapons, especially arrows. * Gaksi dokkaebi (; literally maiden dokkaebi) and chonggak dokkaebi (; literally Bachelor Dokkaebi): Dokkaebi, known to attract humans. * Oenun dokkaebi (; literally one-eyed dokkaebi): A one-eyed dokkaebi that eats a lot. * Oedari dokkaebi (; literally one-legged dokkaebi): A one-legged dokkaebi that likes to play Ssireum. Media Based on the folktale of Goblin, the South Korean cable network tvN showcased a Television series called Guardian: The Lonely and Great God () starring Gong Yoo as title role which was written by Kim Eun- sook, a notable writer in the industry. It earned 3rd place in the nationwide television ratings. There is also a reference to a Dokkaebi in a video game called Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.

It was written and directed by Don Coscarelli and stars Angus Scrimm, James LeGros and Reggie Bannister. The first film's protagonist, Mike, recently released from a mental institution, recruits Reggie and some new friends in an effort to defeat the villain Tall Man. The film caused controversy among fans by recasting main character Mike with LeGros, and was not well received by critics. It was followed by two direct- to-video sequels: Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead (1994) and Phantasm IV: Oblivion (1998) as well as the final film in the Phantasm series: Phantasm: Ravager, which received a theatrical release. Following distribution problems in the U.S., Phantasm II was released in Region 1 on DVD in 2009 and Blu-ray disc in 2013. Plot The film introduces Liz Reynolds, a young woman whose psychic bond to Mike Pearson and the Tall Man manifests in the form of prophetic nightmares. Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him. The scene then transitions where the first film left off, the Tall Man and his minions attempt to kidnap Mike but Reggie manages to save him by blowing up the house. In 1986, after being institutionalized for seven years, Mike, now 19, has faked his recovery to get released. That night he returns to Morningside Cemetery where he proceeds to dig up graves. Reggie interrupts him and explains that what happened in 1978 and the Tall Man were not real. In response, Mike reveals all the coffins he exhumed are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt down the Tall Man. En route to Reggie's house, Mike has a premonition and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before an explosion kills Reggie's entire family. Convinced by Mike's precognition, Reggie agrees to accompany Mike. They break into a hardware store and stock up on supplies and weapons. Traveling north- western country roads, they encounter abandoned towns, pillaged graveyards, and a few of the Tall Man's traps; one is the apparition of a young woman's naked corpse. A gruesome encounter with a creature resembling Liz leads them to travel east towards the town of Perigord, Oregon. Meanwhile, Liz's grandfather dies, and her sister Jeri disappears during the funeral; while searching for Jeri, Liz finds the Tall Man and flees. The presiding priest, Father Meyers, maddened with fear and alcoholism, desecrates the grandfather's body with a knife in a desperate attempt to thwart its reanimation, but the corpse rises and kidnaps Liz's grandmother. In the morning, Liz finds a funeral pin in her grandmother's empty bed, and the Tall Man psychically tells Liz to return at night if she wants to rescue her grandmother. Prior to their arrival in Perigord, Mike awakens to find that Reggie has picked up a hitchhiker named Alchemy who eerily resembles the nude apparition. They find Perigord deserted and dilapidated. When Liz arrives at the mortuary, she is confronted by Father Meyers, who tries to convince her to escape with him, but he is killed by a flying sphere. She encounters the Tall Man and discovers that her grandmother is now one of his Lurkers; she flees and runs into Mike in the cemetery. Later that night, the Tall Man captures Liz and drives away in his hearse; Mike and Reggie chase after him. After the Tall Man runs them off the road, their car explodes. At the crematorium, Liz is taken to the furnace room by the Tall Man's mortician assistants, but she escapes and sends one into the furnace. Mike and Reggie break into the mortuary and find the embalming room. While Reggie pours acid into the embalming fluid, Mike discovers a dimensional portal that requires a sphere to open. They then split up to find Liz. Reggie searches the basement, where he fights off a Graver and several Lurkers with a chainsaw and quadruple shotgun. After a vicious fight Reggie castrates the Graver to death and guns down the Lurkers. Mike saves Liz from a silver sphere, and, when it becomes embedded in the wall, they use it to access the portal. Before they can destroy the building, the Tall Man surprises them, but they fight him off and pump him full of the acid- contaminated embalming fluid, which causes him to melt. They set the building on fire, escape, and are greeted by Alchemy, who has procured an abandoned hearse. As they ride off, Alchemy reveals herself to not be human, and the hearse swerves wildly, then stops. Reggie, bloody and battered, falls to the ground; Mike and Liz, trapped in the hearse, try to convince themselves that this is all just a dream, but the slot to the driver's cabin opens and reveals the Tall Man, who tells them, \\"No, it's not.\\" Hands break the rear window and pull Mike and Liz through it, mirroring the ending of the first film. Cast * Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man * James LeGros as Mike Pearson * Reggie Bannister as Reggie * Paula Irvine as Liz Reynolds * Samantha Phillips as Alchemy * Kenneth Tigar as Father Meyers * Rubin Kushner as Grandpa Alex Murphy * Ruth C. Engel as Grandma Murphy * Stacey Travis as Jeri Reynolds * A. Michael Baldwin as Young Mike * J. Patrick McNamara as Psychologist * Mark Anthony Major as Mortician Themes John Kenneth Muir states that, like many horror films of the 1980s, Phantasm II shifted its focus to guns. Sequels in the 1980s were required to be bigger, gorier, and have more firepower than previous installments. The theme of \\"bigger is better\\" means that everything is upgraded: a quadruple shotgun, golden spheres with increased weaponry, a chainsaw duel, and the nature of the Tall Man's death. Muir states that the narrative of a boy dealing with the loss of his family is unchanged, but it is approached differently: instead of the surrealism of Phantasm, it is approached in a conventional, less abstract manner. Production Writer- director Don Coscarelli says that he had been under pressure to film a sequel but could not come up with a story. Coscarelli considered the first film's ending to be conclusive, and did not feel knowledgeable about writing sequels, but he had what he described as a breakthrough when he realized he could start the film immediately after the previous film's final scene. He also added a road movie element in how Reggie and Mike combat the Tall Man, after which he described the process as straightforward. Universal Studios, who took an interest in the film because they wanted a horror series, allocated three million dollars; this was the lowest budget of any of their films in the 1980s, but it was the highest budget of any Phantasm film. Greg Nicotero and Robert Kurtzman, later of K.N.B. EFX, were recruited for special effects. The studio exerted much control over the film, and they did not allow Coscarelli to include any dream sequences or ambiguity. This is the only installment in the Phantasm series that does not include the entire original main cast (Bill Thornbury and his character did not appear in this film), and the only one to re-cast a main character with another actor. Universal forced Coscarelli to recast the character of Mike, as they wanted a working actor. In an interview, Bannister said that LeGros' casting was initially controversial among hardcore fans but has become more accepted. Release Phantasm II was released theatrically on July 8, 1988, and played on 1227 screens. It was later characterized by Pat H. Broeske of the Los Angeles Times as a box office bomb. The film was later released by Universal Home Entertainment on VHS. A Region 1 DVD was released by Universal on September 15, 2009. Shout! Factory released a new collector's edition DVD and Blu-ray release under their sub-label \\"Scream Factory\\" on March 26, 2013. Both the DVD and Blu-ray contain audio commentary with Don Coscarelli, Angus Scrimm and Reggie Banister, new interviews, deleted scenes, and more. The film was played at the Phantasm-ania festival in February 2013. This was the first time it had played theatrically since 1988. Reception According to Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, 38% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating is 4.22/10. In a negative review, Roger Ebert rated the film one out four stars and likened it to an extended dream without logic or a coherent plot, full of nightmarish images and no character development. Time Out also said that \\"the only valid reason for seeing this belated sequel is that it goes some way towards explaining the incomprehensible plot of its predecessor.\\" Variety called the film \\"an utterly unredeeming, full-gore sequel\\" and \\"incredibly morbid and meaningless\\". Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer described the film as \\"a series of apparently unrelated horrors visited upon good- looking blond people\\" and criticized the gore. Roger Hurlburt of the Sun- Sentinel criticized LeGros' acting and called the film a waste of time. Writing in The New York Times, Caryn James stated that \\"there are some grotesquely stylish and scary moments\\" but they \\"seem to take as long to arrive as the sequel did.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"a fast, entertaining fright show\\" but needlessly literal and gratuitous, as the film series transforms from a surreal thriller to a trite horror film. In a positive review, Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune stated that \\"Coscarelli has captured the texture of a disjointed, half-remembered nightmare\\" and likens it to the 1920s surrealist film movement. The Philadelphia Daily News Amy Alexander said the film \\"has all the elements of a classic serial horror film\\" and praised the special effects. Some critics reviewed the film on home video. Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called the Phantasm sequels indecipherable and too weird to understand, though he recommends Phantasm II to fans of the original. Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club rated the film a B and wrote of the cult appeal. Matt Serafini of Dread Central rated the film four out of five but criticized the more realistic approach taken in favor of the surrealism of the first film. Bloody Disgusting rated the film three-and-a-half out of five, but said that the film seems dated now and does not quite live up to its nostalgic value. Andy Klein of the Glendale News-Press cited the film's weirdness and creepiness as making up for breaking the rules of what makes a good horror film. Marco Lanzagorta of PopMatters rated it ten out of ten stars and wrote, \\"The narrative of Phantasm II may sound absurd and ridiculous, but the feelings of dread and anxiety that we get while we watch it are very real.\\" UGO included Phantasm II in its list of Surprisingly Decent Horror Sequels and called it a \\"sturdy continuation\\".

The first in a quintet of novels covering the Arthurian legend, it is followed by The Hollow Hills. Plot introduction The protagonist of this story is a boy named Myrddin Emrys, also known as Merlin, which is the Welsh form of the word \\"falcon\\". (Welsh dd is pronounced th as in thus, so Myrddin is roughly pronounced Murthin.) This story is told in first-person narrative and includes his journey to find a home as he travels through Wales, Brittany, England and Ireland. Emrys is also known as Ambrosius, or Prince of Light. Plot summary This novel covers the time from Merlin's sixth year until he becomes a young man. The Romans have recently left Britain, which is now divided into a number of kingdoms loosely united under a High King. Merlin is the illegitimate son of a Welsh princess, who refuses to name his father. Small for his age and often abused or neglected, Merlin occasionally has clairvoyant visions. These visions and his unknown parentage cause him to be referred to as \\"the son of a devil\\" and \\"bastard child\\". Educated by a hermit, Galapas, who teaches him to use his psychic powers as well as his earthly gifts, Merlin eventually finds his way to the court of Ambrosius Aurelianus in Brittany. There, he assists in Ambrosius's preparations to invade and unify Britain, defeat Vortigern and his Saxon allies, and become its High King. Also exiled in Brittany is Uther, Ambrosius's brother, heir and supporter. It is revealed that Merlin is Ambrosius's son, the result of a brief relationship between Ambrosius and Merlin's mother. Merlin returns to Britain but finds Galapas killed. He is captured by Vortigern who is attempting to build a fortress at Dinas Emrys - but each night the newly built walls collapse. The king's mystics say the fort will only be built when a child with no father is sacrificed and his blood spilt on the ground. Vortigern plans to use Merlin as the sacrifice. Merlin realises that the fort's foundation is unstable due to the caves below ground, but he plays to their superstition and pretends to attribute the problems to dragons beneath the ground. (The dragon is Ambrosius's emblem.) As a result of this, Merlin briefly becomes known as Vortigern's prophet. Days later, Ambrosius invades and defeats Vortigern. Merlin uses his engineering skills to rebuild Stonehenge, but has visions of Ambrosius's death, which are fulfilled when a comet appears in the sky and Ambrosius dies. Uther, Ambrosius's younger brother, becomes King Uther Pendragon. However, Britain is thrown into chaos when Uther, besotted with Duchess Ygraine, goes to war with her husband, Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall. Merlin helps Uther to enter Tintagel Castle by stealth, knowing the tryst will lead to the birth of King Arthur.  Characters  * Merlin, known also as Myrddin, with Emrys as a sort of patronym. The stories explore his learning to use magic and his centrality in the Matter of Britain. * Niniane, his mother, a Christian who joins the local nunnery when he is 12. * King of Maridunum, an unnamed king of South Wales; grandfather of Merlin, father of Camlach and Niniane, married to Queen Olwen. * Camlach, uncle of Merlin, he is prepared to kill Merlin to remove him from the line of inheritance. * Galapas, a local mage who teaches Merlin much natural lore and some magic, and who bequeathes to him the crystal cave. * Cerdic, a Saxon slave, friend to Merlin; he accidentally causes the death of the king. * Vortigern, an ambitious warlord- king who battles Ambrosius for Britain. * Ambrosius Aurelianus, Merlin's father; a Romanized Celt, he invades England from Lesser Britain when Merlin is 18 and has joined him. * Uther Pendragon, Merlin's uncle, Ambrosius's younger brother, eventually High King of Britain and father of King Arthur. He and Merlin retain an alliance, if not friendship, throughout their lives. * Cadal, servant to Ambrosius and then to Merlin. * Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, is loyal to Ambrosius but later betrayed by Uther and Merlin, who conspire to get his young wife, Ygraine, together with Uther; Gorlois dies in battle that same night. * Ygraine, Duchess of Cornwall and mother of Arthur. * Ralf, loyal page to Ygraine; he later serves Merlin. * Ulfin, servant to Uther and, at times, Merlin.  The Cave  The crystal cave itself is a spherical mini-cave hidden in the back of a hillside cave six miles from the king's palace at Maridunum. It is described, in young Merlin's first discovery of it, as \\"a globe, a round chamber floored, roofed, lined with crystals. They were fine as glass, and smooth as glass, but clearer than any glass I had ever seen, brilliant as diamonds.\\" The facets are possibly those of geodes. The hill is considered by the locals to be a home or haunt of a deity named Myrddin, a god of air and heights, so its cave is imbued with magical properties. Merlin lives there whenever not called upon for political duties. The small crystal cave is where he frequently retreats to seek revelations or prophecies.  Reception  In Stewart's obituary, The New York Times described her as an \\"author of romantic thrillers who jumped genres in her 50s to create an internationally best-selling trilogy of Merlin books, reimagining the Arthurian legend from a sorcerer's point of view,\\" and said, \\"Reading Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain, she was inspired to retell the story of King Arthur as seen by Merlin, the king's adviser and house magician. The trilogy introduced her work to a new generation and, in many cases, to male readers for the first time. ... The books, set in the fifth century, were praised for their unusual blend of fantasy and historical detail.\\" The Guardian spoke of Stewart's own considerations as well as that of her publishers: \\"The Crystal Cave (1970), the first of a fictional trilogy about Merlin, arose from her fascination with Roman-British history. The unexpected switch at first alarmed her publishers ‚Äì she was, unusually, published by the same firm, Hodder & Stoughton, for her entire career, never using an agent ‚Äì but the book was a No 1 bestseller for weeks. Of all her books, The Crystal Cave is the most enduring, and has lost none of its freshness. It is a masterful imagining of Merlin's upbringing that vividly evokes fifth-century Britain. The Hollow Hills (1973) and The Last Enchantment (1979) completed the trilogy, earning Stewart favourable comparisons with another leading Arthurian, TH White. They were the books of which she was most proud.\\" Kirkus Reviews said with a touch of disdain, \\"With its mythic mists and galloping legends, fifth century Britain is fair game and Miss Stewart takes to whole cloth with a couturier's skill. ... Period play, ripe and windy, for ladies easily lulled--and there are many of them.\\" Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The novel was adapted into a television series by the BBC in the 1990s, retitled Merlin of the Crystal Cave, and starred Robert Powell as Ambrosius.

It first appears in 1507 as the name of a nearby house, and was later transferred to the street and then the suburb which was part of the regality of the Canongate.S Harris, The Place Names of Edinburgh, London 1996 The derivation of the name from a nunnery of St Mary of Placentia, often mentioned in histories of Edinburgh, is an invention by William Maitland in his 1753 History of Edinburgh. The street is largely residential - mainly 19th century tenements and 20th century flats - although the University of Edinburgh owns property in the area, including a large new [2017] university student flats complex on St Leonard's Street, the southerly extension of the Pleasance, on a site formerly occupied by a Homebase home improvements and gardening store. In addition, although the Pleasance along with St Leonard's Street is a quieter area than the nearby main commercial centres and streets of the Southside there are several restaurants, pubs, a few shops, lawyers' offices, churches, and the modern St Leonard's police station. After years of planning blight from the 1960s and 1970s in which redevelopment of the formerly rather run- down area was hampered after the abandonment of bizarre plans to build a major road comparable to a motorway, from the late 20th century onwards the area benefited from a gradual renaissance. University of Edinburgh union buildings Student Union buildings The Pleasance contains a complex of university-owned buildings which, for nine months of the year, operate as one of the four Student Union venues that serve the Edinburgh University Students' Association. In August, the complex is converted to use as one of the major venues of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, for which it is most publicly well- known. The Pleasance Theatre Trust, named after the complex, runs the venue during the Fringe, as well as a sister venue in London. The Pleasance complex consists of two main bars: The Pleasance Bar and The Cabaret Bar; the Pleasance Theatre (with a capacity of 320 ); and several rooms that can be booked out for society use. Two LCD televisions and a large projector also ensure that all major sporting events are shown in the main bar. The Pleasance is the only one of the four student unions to hold a public licence, which means anyone can gain access without having to be a university student or signed in by a member. As well as providing the opportunity to purchase food and drink, the Pleasance complex maintains a program of evening entertainment. Live comedy traditionally takes place on Tuesday evenings, with acts such as Russell Howard and Jim Jefferies appearing in recent years. The Edinburgh Folk Club use the Cabaret Bar as the venue for their gigs on Wednesday nights. However the busiest evenings of the week normally fall on Monday nights, with the Pleasance Pub Quiz for instance attracting up to 40 teams on occasions in recent years.

Hunt, 45 Mass. 111 (1842) was a case in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on the subject of labor unions. Prior to Hunt the legality of labor combinations in America was uncertain. In March 1842, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw ruled that labor combinations were legal provided that they were organized for a legal purpose and used legal means to achieve their goals. Labor combination laws before Hunt Cordwainer statue on Watling street, in the Cordwainer ward of the City of London. The history of labor disputes in America substantially precedes the Revolutionary period. In 1636, for instance, there was a fishermen's strike on an island off the coast of Maine, and in 1677 twelve carmen were fined for going on strike in New York City.Commons, ii-iii However, most instances of labor unrest during the colonial period were temporary and isolated, and rarely resulted in the formation of permanent groups of laborers for negotiation purposes.Commons, ii-iii Little legal recourse was available to those injured by the unrest because strikes were not typically considered illegal.Commons, ii-iii The only known case of a criminal prosecution of workers in the colonial era occurred as a result of a carpenters' strike in Savannah, Georgia in 1746.Commons, ii- iii By the beginning of the 19th-century, after the revolution, little had changed. The career path for most artisans still involved apprenticeship under a master, followed by a move into independent production.Tomlins, 111 However, over the course of the Industrial Revolution, this model rapidly changed, particularly in the major metropolitan areas. For instance, in Boston in 1790, the vast majority of the 1,300 artisans in the city described themselves as \\"master workman\\". By 1815, journeymen workers without independent means of production had displaced these \\"masters\\" as the majority.Tomlins, 112 By that time journeymen also outnumbered masters in New York City and Philadelphia.Tomlins, 112 This shift occurred as a result of large-scale transatlantic and rural-urban migration. Migration into the coastal cities created a larger population of potential laborers, which in turn allowed controllers of capital to invest in labor-intensive enterprises on a larger scale.Tomlins, 111 Craft workers found that these changes launched them into competition with each other to a degree that they had not experienced previously, which limited their opportunities and created substantial risks of downward mobility that had not existed prior to that time.Tomlins, 111 These conditions led to the first labor combination cases in America. Over the first half of the 19th century, there were twenty-three known cases of indictment and prosecution for criminal conspiracy, taking place in six states: Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Virginia.Tomlins, 128 The central question in these cases was invariably whether workmen in combination would be permitted to use their collective bargaining power to obtain benefits‚Äîincreased wages, decreased hours, or improved conditions‚Äîwhich were beyond their ability to obtain as individuals. The cases overwhelmingly resulted in convictions. However, in most instances the plaintiffs' desire was to establish favorable precedent, not to impose harsh penalties, and the fines were typically modest.Commons, viii One of the central themes of the cases prior to the landmark decision in Commonwealth vs. Hunt was the applicability of the English common law in post-revolutionary America. Whether the English common law applied‚Äîand in particular whether the common law notion that a conspiracy to raise wages was illegal applied‚Äîwas frequently the subject of debate between the defense and the prosecution.Tomlins, 133 For instance, in Commonwealth v. Pullis, a case in 1806 against a combination of journeymen cordwainers in Philadelphia for conspiring to raise their wages, the defense attorneys referred to the common law as arbitrary and unknowable and instead praised the legislature as the embodiment of the democratic promise of the revolution.Lloyd, 107-24 In ruling that a combination to raise wages was per se illegal, Recorder Moses Levy strongly disagreed, writing that \\"[t]he acts of the legislature form but a small part of that code from which the citizen is to learn his duties... [i]t is in the volumes of the common law we are to seek for information in the far greater number, as well as the most important causes that come before our tribunals.\\"Lloyd, 107-24 As a result of the spate of convictions against combinations of laborers, the typical narrative of early American labor law states that, prior to Hunt in Massachusetts in 1842, peaceable combinations of workingmen to raise wages, shorten hours or ensure employment were illegal in the United States, as they had been under English common law.Tomlins, 133 In England, criminal conspiracy laws were first held to include combinations in restraint of trade in the Court of the Star Chamber early in the 17th Century.Commons, iv The precedent was solidified in 1721 by The King v. Journeymen Tailors of Cambridge, which found tailors guilty of a conspiracy to raise wages.Commons, iv Leonard Levy went so far as to refer to Hunt as the \\"Magna Carta of American trade-unionism,\\"Levy, 183 illustrating its perceived standing as the major point of divergence in the American and English legal treatment of unions which, \\"removed the stigma of criminality from labor organizations.\\"Levy, 183 However, Levy's statement incorrectly characterizes the case law in American prior to Hunt. Pullis was actually unusual in strictly following the English common law and holding that a combination to raise wages was by itself illegal. More often combination cases prior to Hunt did not hold that unions were illegal per se, but rather found some other justification for a conviction.Witte, 825 After Pullis in 1806, eighteen other prosecutions of laborers for conspiracies followed within the next three decades.Witte, 825 However, only one such case, People v. Fisher, also held that a combination for the purpose of raising wages was illegal.Witte, 825 Several other cases held that the methods used by the unions, rather than the unions themselves, were illegal.Witte, 825 For instance, in People v. Melvin, cordwainers were again convicted of a conspiracy to raise wages. Unlike in Pullis, however, the court held that the combination's existence itself was not unlawful, but nevertheless reached a conviction because the cordwainers had refused to work for any master who paid lower wages, or with any laborer who accepted lower wages, than what the combination had stipulated.Tomlins, 139 The court held that methods used to obtain higher wages would be unlawful if they were judged to be deleterious to the general welfare of the community.Tomlins, 140 Commonwealth v. Morrow continued to refine this standard, stating that, \\"an agreement of two or more to the prejudice of the rights of others or of society\\" would be illegal.Shaler, 24 Another line of cases, led by Justice John Gibson of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision in Commonwealth v. Carlisle, held that the motive of the combination, rather than simply its existence, was the key to illegality.Tomlins, 146 Gibson wrote, \\"Where the act is lawful for an individual, it can be the subject of a conspiracy, when done in concert, only where there is a direct intention that injury shall result from it.\\"Tomlins, 146 Still other courts rejected Pullis' rule of per se illegality in favor of a rule that asked whether the combination was a but-for cause of injury.Tomlins, 147 Thus, as economist Edwin Witte stated, \\"[T]he doctrine that a combination to raise wages is illegal was allowed to die by common consent. No leading case was required for its overthrow.\\"Witte, 827 Nevertheless, while Hunt was not the first case to hold that labor combinations were legal, it was the first to do so explicitly and in clear terms. Background Members of the Boston Journeymen Bootmaker's Society, founded in 1835 and local to Boston, worked exclusively on high-quality boots.Nelles, 1131 In 1835, in response to rampant inflation caused by Andrew Jackson's destruction of the Bank of the United States, the society raised their pay, by means of striking, to $1.75 per pair of boots produced.Nelles, 1131 In 1836, they staged another strike, this time successfully raising their pay to $2.00 per pair. Their rates remained the same in 1840, when the incidents giving rise to Hunt occurred. However, by that time increases in the quality of the boots being produced prevented the bootmakers from producing pairs as quickly, essentially lowering their hourly rate in the midst of a severe economic downturn triggered by the Panic of 1837.Nelles, 1131 One journeyman bootworker, Jeremiah Horne, was in a dispute with the Society. Horne began to have disagreements with the Society when he agreed to do extra work on a pair of boots without charging for the extra labor. The Society imposed a fine on Horne, which he refused to pay.Tomlins, 200 Ultimately the fine was forgiven when Horne's master, Isaac Wait, agreed to pay Horne for the work at the Society-fixed rate.Nelles, 1131 Horne nevertheless continued to breach the Society's rules, and soon had incurred another $7 in fees.Nelles, 1132 The Society demanded that he pay. When Horne refused, the Society threatened a walkout of Wait's shop and Wait fired him.Tomlins, 200 Horne responded by entering a complaint with the Suffolk County Attorney, Samuel D. Parker, and by sending his cousin, Dennis, who was also a member of the Society, to try to reach a settlement with them. Dennis attended a Society meeting in early October 1840, but was ridiculed and stormed out.Nelles, 1132 A few days later, on October 8, an indictment was entered charging that the Society was a criminal conspiracy to impoverish employers and non-union laborers. Seven members of the Society were named as defendants. Although there was no evidence that the Society planned to strike or that there was any large-scale disagreement between employers and the Society, Parker decided to take the case.Nelles, 1133 The trial began on October 14 and ended on October 22.Nelles, 1132 Judgment =Trial court= Robert Rantoul, Jr. At trial, the prosecution, led by Parker, focused on proving that the Society was coercive. Wait, Horne's master, testified, \\"He did not feel at liberty to employ any but society men\\", because he, \\"would not wish to lose five or six good workmen for the sake of one.\\"Nelles, 1135 However, he also testified he had not been oppressed and that he had benefited from the Society's existence.Tomlins, 201 Parker tried to call Horne himself to testify, but the defense successfully prevented his testimony from being heard on the ground that he was an atheist .Nelles, 1136 The prosecution, however, was able to directly ask several masters, over the defense's objection, whether the Society was coercive. Some said yes.Nelles, 1136 The Society hired Robert Rantoul, Jr. to represent them.Tomlins, 200 Rantoul's defense focused on establishing the benefits of the Society. He called witnesses who testified the wages stipulated by the Society were reasonable and non-members were also able to attain wages at the same rate. Non-workers were only prevented from working at a handful of the larger shops.Nelles, 1138 Rantoul also called representatives from other professional organizations, such as the Boston Medical Association and the Boston Bar, of which the Judge, the District Attorney, the Attorney General, Daniel Webster and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, Lemuel Shaw, were all members.Nelles, 1138 Rantoul also solicited testimony that the Bar Association fixed minimum fees for which its members could receive and forbade members from advising or consulting any non-member attorney.Nelles, 1138 He hoped to show the jury that professional organizations such the Bootmaker's Society were not uncommon in Boston. Rantoul also argued there was no law in Massachusetts against a conspiracy in restraint of trade. (At that time in Massachusetts, juries still served as triers of both law and fact). Rantoul told the jury, \\"We have not adopted the whole mass of the common law of England. [...] Law against acts done in restraint of trade belong to that portion of the law of England which we have not adopted.\\"Nelles, 1144 Rantoul argued, as the conspiracy itself was not unlawful, the question was whether the defendants had injured anyone through an illegal act.Tomlins, 202 He stated, \\"We contend they have a perfect right to form a society for their mutual interest and improvement. [...] To substantiate these charges [...] they must prove actual force, fraud and nuisance.\\"Tomlins, 202 Rantoul's emphasis on the requirement of injury recalled Gibson's opinion in Carlisle twenty years earlier, and drew from the entire line of cases opposing Pullis and Fisher.Tomlins, 203 Rantoul's efforts, however, were greatly undermined by Judge Thacher's emotional charge to the jury. Thacher told the jury that if societies such as the Bootmaker's Society were justified by the law and became common, it would \\"render property insecure, and make it the spoil of the multitude, would annihilate property, and involve society in a common ruin.\\"Thacher, 19 Thacher also specifically rebutted Rantoul with regard to the status of the common law, stating that \\"conspiracy is an offence at common law, as adopted in Massachusetts, and by this decision and that of this court you must abide.\\"Tomlins, 22 Levy wrote that Thacher's charge, \\"practically directed a verdict of guilty.\\"Levy, 186 After Thacher gave his instructions the jury returned a conviction against all seven defendants. Rantoul appealed the case to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. =State Supreme Court= Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw held the union's actions were not unlawful, because the objects of the union and the action taken of threatening to stop work to prevent Horne's continued employment, were not unlawful in the law of Massachusetts. This contrasted with the laws in England in 1721, in R v Journeymen Tailors of Cambridge. The union could exercise \\"a power which might be exerted for useful and honorable purposes, or for dangerous and pernicious ones.\\" But only if an independently unlawful act could be found, which was clearly laid down in the law, could a combination of people to do the same thing also be unlawful. He pointed out that competition among businesses were often treated the same, and so the economic loss to the employer or Horne could not count as actionable damage. The workers were \\"free to work for whom the please, or not to work, if they so prefer.... We cannot perceive that it is criminal for men to agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights, in such a manner as best to subserve their own interests.\\"45 Mass. 111, 121-130 (1842) Shaw CJ's judgment went as follows. Significance Shaw's landmark opinion in favor of labor was incongruous with his politics and other jurisprudence. Shaw wrote his opinion in Hunt just one week after he decided another landmark labor case, Farwell v. Boston & Worcester R.R. Corp. In that case, Shaw upheld the fellow-servant rule by deciding that a railroad company could not be held liable when a mistake by an employee operating a rail switch caused an injury to another employee.Farwell, 49 As the outcome in Farwell would suggest, Shaw was not ordinarily considered a friend of labor.Nelles, 1152 Walter Nelles wrote that, \\"The constituency to which [Shaw] was keenest comprised State Street and Beacon Hill, the bankers, the textile manufacturers, the railway builders.\\"Nelles, 1152 Nelles theorized that Shaw was more concerned with tariff protection than with labor concerns, and that his decision in Hunt was a product of strategic consideration. Nelles notes that in 1842, in the middle of a depression, labor unrest in the textile mills that drove much of Boston's economy was very unlikely.Nelles, 1158 However, Whigs like Shaw may have been concerned that agitating the working class would help bring the Democratic party to power in the election of 1844.Nelles, 1152 Whigs worried that the Democrats would abolish the tariffs protecting the weakened textile industry. Shaw's decision in Hunt, therefore, may have been motivated by a desire to placate Boston's working class. Whatever Shaw's motivation, his opinion in Hunt provided a clear statement that labor combinations which used legal means to achieve legal ends were lawful. The degree of Hunt's impact is a matter of some debate. Levy notes that in the forty years after Hunt was decided, the case served as the authoritative statement of the law on labor combinations.Levy, 206 However, as favorable as Hunt was for labor unions, its holding still left the door open for courts to convict strikers by declaring certain labor activity criminal, or by holding the purpose of a strike to be an unlawful interference with private enterprise. Also, Witte notes that there were limited opportunities to apply Hunt until the end of the Civil War. Witte was able to find only three conspiracy cases brought anywhere in the United States between 1842 and 1863.Witte, 829 However, between 1863 and 1880 the pace of conspiracy indictments picked up again. At least fifteen cases were brought during that time.Witte, 829 Despite Hunt's softening of the conspiracy doctrine, convictions were still obtained and harsh sentences imposed. For instance, in 1869, members of a mine committee in Pottsville, Pennsylvania were found guilty of conspiracy, sentenced to jail for thirty days and heavily fined.Witte, 830 Prosecutions in this period led to labor efforts to gain relief through legislation. In 1869, Pennsylvania passed a statute declaring labor unions legal if formed for \\"mutual aid, benefit, and protection\\" and when convictions continued to be obtained, passed another law in 1872 providing that laborers could collectively refuse to work for any employer.Witte, 830 The need for such legislation suggests that Hunt, while beneficial for labor, was hardly a guarantee that workers would be able to organize without fear of legal repercussion.

He was the first person to codify a set of rules to be used in such contests; prior to this the \\"rules\\" that existed were very loosely defined and tended to vary from contest to contest. His seven rules of how boxing would be conducted at his amphitheatre (the largest and most influential at that time) evolved later into the London Prize Ring rules which are widely regarded as the foundation stone of the sport that would become boxing, prior to the development of the Marquess of Queensberry rules in the 1860s. Broughton's rules Fighting career According to one source, Jack Broughton was a farmer's son from the village of Baunton in Gloucestershire who left home at the age of 12 and made his way to Bristol where he worked at the waterside. Here he is supposed to have fought with local \\"Bristol lads, who were always, even then, celebrated for their pugnacious proclivities\\". Broughton then, supposedly, came to the notice of James Figg, who brought him to London, to train and fight at Figg's amphitheatre. The Annual Register of 1789, in announcing Broughton's death, merely says of Broughton's origin: \\"he was originally bred a waterman\\". In 1741 Broughton inflicted a heavy defeat on George Stevenson, who was the head of Figg's amphitheatre after the latter's death. As a result of his status in boxing, and with help from a number of wealthy patrons, he opened his own amphitheatre in Hanway Road, near Oxford Street. Here, Broughton and his team staged boxing exhibitions. The amphitheatre's first fights were staged on 13 March 1743, when, for an entrance fee of a shilling or less, patrons were able to watch a display of boxing between several competitors. Broughton drew up a set of rules for the sport that were regarded as definitive for around 100 years. The rules stipulated that a round would last until a man went down, and there was to be a 30-second interval between rounds. The rules were applied widely in boxing until they were replaced by the London Prize Ring rules in 1838. In 1750 he fought Jack Slack. After 14 minutes of the fight, as a result of a blinding punch, Broughton was unable to see his man, and thus had to retire from the bout. The Duke of Cumberland, Broughton's patron at the time was said to have lost thousands of pounds on the match. After the fight he closed his amphitheatre, and instead ran an antiques business. The Bruiser Bruisd; Or, the Knowing Ones Taken-in. A boxing match between John Broughton and Jack Slack Broughton was one of the original inductees of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, inducted as a pioneer of the sport.

The show revolves around McNamara/Troy, the plastic surgery practice he runs with his business partner and best friend, Sean McNamara. Character overview Christian Troy is initially characterized as a self-absorbed womanizer with no qualms about using people to get what he wants. He drives flashy cars, wears Gucci suits, and frequents Miami's best nightclubs. However, the character is eventually shown to have a vulnerable side beneath his callous exterior. In one episode, he confesses that he was molested as a child by his foster father. This early trauma destroyed his faith in a just God. In another story arc, he meets his biological mother, who tells him that he is the product of rape; she then cuts off any contact with him because he looks just like his father, her rapist, and because she does not want her \\"real family\\" to know about that part of her life. He has had affairs with most of the series' female characters, including Sean's wife, Julia (Joely Richardson); initially unbeknownst to Sean and Christian, Julia and Sean's son, Matt (John Hensley) is, in fact, Christian's biological child, with whom he is very close. The show's first two seasons include many episodes centered on Christian's dysfunctional relationship with Kimber Henry (Kelly Carlson), a former patient whom he often manipulated and cheated on. Role in the series In the first season, he has a one-night stand with Gina Russo (Jessalyn Gilsig), a recovering sex addict. Gina, angered to have broken her vow of celibacy, resolves to make Christian's life miserable, and the two initiate a bitter, love/hate sexual relationship that is not resolved until the fourth season. After the one-night stand, Gina becomes pregnant and throughout the pregnancy, Christian believed he is the father. When the baby is born, however, Christian realizes he is obviously not the father since the child is half black. However, Christian takes care of and becomes the surrogate father to her son, Wilber. After trying to hire a nanny to watch his son, he begins sleeping with her. While having sex with her one night, he finds out that she had been giving Wilber cough medicine to keep the baby quiet. He immediately fires her and spends the night of his 40th birthday with his son, his birthday wish being a prayer to God to make him a good father. He later loses custody of Wilber to the boy's biological father. In the third season, Christian is sexually assaulted by The Carver, a masked serial rapist preying on McNamara/Troy's patients. He is briefly suspected of, and arrested once for, the Carver's crimes. A distraught Christian temporarily withdraws from work, prompting Sean to bring in another surgeon, Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos). Costa involves himself in Christian's relationship with Kimber, and the two become bitter rivals; Campos is eventually revealed as the Carver. Christian almost marries Kimber, but the relationship sours after she is kidnapped by the Carver; after she is rescued, she refuses to let Christian see what the rapist had done to her face and body. She breaks off their relationship so she can recover emotionally from her ordeal. Eventually, Kimber comes back as a Scientologist. When Kimber gets pregnant, Christian steals DNA for a paternity test, convinced he is the father. Distressed by his apparent inability to form an intimate adult relationship, Christian entered psychotherapy with Dr. Faith Wolper (Brooke Shields) ‚Äî and eventually had sex with her. Dr. Wolper also suggested that Christian's relationship block exists because he is really in love with Sean. During that time Christian begins dreaming about having sex with Sean. She later tells Christian that she is a recovering sex addict, and realized after their tryst that she still had a problem. She then asks him to remove a tattoo an ex-lover had forced her to get as a means of degrading her. Christian eventually realizes the dreams are the result of his own personal identity crisis, and resolves his problems with Sean. He also begins an affair with Michelle Landau (Sanaa Lathan), the wife of McNamara/Troy's new owner. Soon after they meet, Christian suspects her of having a relationship with a woman named James (Jacqueline Bisset) who is smuggling organs out of the clinic. Christian finds out that James is Michelle's former pimp and pays her off to leave Michelle and McNamara/Troy alone. Michelle's husband, Burt (Larry Hagman), finds out about the affair from Dr. Wolper, and tries to force the two to have sex in front of him. When Burt later tries to have sex with Michelle, he has a stroke and dies after she refuses to give him his medicine. After Burt's death, Christian and Michelle get engaged, and Michelle agrees to be Wilber's adoptive mother. James does not keep her end of the bargain, however; she uses McNamara/Troy as a base of operations. Christian then finds out that James works for drug lord Escobar Gallardo (Robert LaSardo). James eventually commits suicide. He and Michelle buy Sean's stake in McNamara/Troy after Sean moves to California. Just as it seems they will live happily ever after, Christian finds out that she had been James' accomplice in the organ smuggling ring. Disgusted, he leaves her and follows Sean to California. However, life is not easy for Christian and Sean in LA; for the first two months, they have no clients. Desperate for money, they get jobs at a reality show as consults and guest-stars. When his hair implants come in wrong, Christian has to miss his first appearance on the show; Sean, meanwhile, is a hit with the audience. Out of spite, Christian breaks a confidentiality agreement and reveals that he had performed surgery on an actress to get recognition himself. This falls flat as he is double crossed by the magazine, which does not publish his story and tells his agent about his breach of contract. He then does a porn photoshoot, attracting gay men to his office. He and Sean also operate on rival Marilyn Monroe impersonators; Christian then has a threesome with both of them. He then has sex with Julia. Christian dabbles in male prostitution after a woman mistakes him for an actual prostitute named Campbell. Afterwards, the client tells a friend, forcing Christian to give up his \\"night job\\". He decides to give religion a try after meeting a nun. When Sean's family friend Eden Lord (AnnaLynne McCord) threatens to tell Sean about his night with Julia, he solves the problem by setting her up to look like a drug addict and admitting her into rehab. She comes back while they are filming en episode of show and reveals the truth, but Sean does not believe her and she then tells him she lied. Julia and Christian begin to have a relationship; when Sean eventually discovers their relationship, both admit to him that they are in love. However, Christian is tempted to cheat on Julia yet again with Gina, who was hired temporarily as receptionist. Oddly enough, Sean had chosen Gina for this position because Christian was the least likely to cheat with her, but the two find non-coital means to have an affair. When Gina admits the affair to Julia and Christian meets her on the roof of his office building to serve her a restraining order, he is offered a condom by Gina. He begins to have intercourse with her on the ledge of the roof, when Gina is thrust off the building, falling to her death. Matt sleeps with Christian's patient Emme Lowell (Jeannine Kaspar) after Christian tries to set them up. Emme's mother Darlene (Lisa Darr) comes to LA to meet with Christian, and informs Christian that Emme is his daughter. The two immediately get a paternity test, which proves that Emme is indeed Christian's daughter. They both try to persuade Matt and Emme to break up, and in the end are successful. Christian develops second stage breast cancer, and undergoes a mastectomy, with Sean promising to perform the reconstruction. After undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, Christian becomes very ill and Liz decides to stay with him while he recovers. Eventually the two end up having sex, leading to them becoming a couple briefly until Christian recovers enough to resume his womanizing lifestyle. A hurt Liz quits her job at McNamara/Troy and moves back to Miami. Despite his apparent good health, Christian learns that the cancer has spread and he has six months to a year left to live. Realizing he does not want to spend what time he has left alone, he travels back to Miami and asks Liz to come back by proposing to her. Liz returns, and discovers that a large amount of medicine is missing from the storeroom. Christian admits to Liz that he stole it because he found out his cancer had returned and he was going to use the drugs to kill himself, but changed his mind. Liz is insulted that Christian asked her to marry him so that she \\"could help him die\\" and throws the ring back at him. Later, Liz changes her mind and agrees to marry Christian after realizing he is sincere in his wish to spend what time he has left with her. However, shortly after his wedding to Liz, he receives a phone call from his doctor telling him that his cancer is fully in remission. His results were switched with another patient's due to a computer glitch. The doctor wishes him and his new wife a long, happy life together. In the beginning of season 6 Christian and Liz have broken up due to Christian finding out about his cancer remission. An embittered Liz sues Christian and threatens to take everything he owns. Meanwhile, Matt has taken up mime lessons, but after it tanks Matt uses his theatrical look to hold people at (fake) gunpoint. After seeing a patient's darkness kill his own family, Liz decides to drop her case and set Christian free, wanting nothing to do with him. Christian and Kimber marry in Season 6, but the marriage is ill-fated from the start. Kimber is having an affair with Sean, which makes her feel extremely guilty and affects her sex life with Christian. In order to spice things up, Christian tries to strangle her during sex, (at the suggestion of one of his surgery patients) but since she refuses to do it to him, he attempts to strangle himself in the shower and passes out. Kimber discovers him lying on the floor and comes to his aid. He then confesses that Kimber deserves better, and that he will never be able to love her like she wants to be loved. Though Kimber makes a last-ditch effort to save the marriage, Christian has already given up on it, which drives Kimber to drown herself by jumping off a boat. Christian is wracked with guilt about Kimber's death; when Kimber's mother comes to town, however, he has no qualms about sleeping with her. Kimber's ghost then appears and ridicules him. Her ghost also appears a final time, and reveals she killed herself to escape him, and believes that Sean might do the same if he remains at McNamara/Troy. Julia returns to town for Matt's wedding to his girlfriend Ramona (Melonie Diaz), and reveals that she is engaged, but this does not stop Christian from making moves on her, telling her he still loves her. Julia rejects him and leaves, crushing Christian's ego. After much thought about how his lifestyle is affecting Sean, Christian makes the decision to dissolve the partnership between them. He tells Sean that he knows he is miserable at McNamara/Troy and that there is no reason for him to stay since Julia has taken the children to England. Sean has become attached to Raphael, the orphan that former patient Ava Moore (Famke Janssen) left at the practice, and knowing that Sean does not want to give the baby up, Christian gets him a plane ticket to leave the country with Raphael. Sean reluctantly agrees, and walks out of the office to see a new sign up in the foyer...\\"Troy/Cruz\\". At the airport, the ex-partners say their goodbyes, and separate at the terminal. Though Sean looks back, Christian keeps walking until he reaches the bar, where he meets an attractive young blonde. Revealing the fact that he will never change, he attempts to make a move on the girl, who rejects him until he says he cannot have a drink because he has to perform surgery the next day. She replies, \\"You're a doctor?\\", an allusion to the way Christian first met Kimber. Christian smiles and says, 'Plastic surgeon.'

Pierpont (June 16, 1866 - December 9, 1938) was a Connecticut-born American mathematician. His father Cornelius Pierpont was a wealthy New Haven businessman. He did undergraduate studies at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, initially in mechanical engineering, but turned to mathematics. He went to Europe after graduating in 1886. He studied in Berlin, and later in Vienna. He prepared his PhD at the University of Vienna under Leopold Gegenbauer and Gustav Ritter von Escherich. His thesis, defended in 1894, is entitled Zur Geschichte der Gleichung f√ºnften Grades bis zum Jahre 1858. After his defense, he returned to New Haven and was appointed as a lecturer at Yale University, where he spent most of his career. In 1898, he became professor. Initially, his research dealt with Galois theory of equations. The Pierpont primes are named after Pierpont, who introduced them in 1895 in connection with a problem of constructing regular polygons with the use of conic sections. After 1900, he worked in real and complex analysis. In his textbooks of real analysis, he introduced a definition of the integral analogous to Lebesgue integration. His definition was later criticized by Maurice Fr√©chet. Finally, in the 1920s, his interest turned to non-Euclidean geometry. Papers by J. P. Pierpont   * Books by J. P.

Cesnur.org It was founded by Hon-Ming Chen (Èô≥ÊÅÜÊòé born 1955), who first associated it with UFOs and later had the group misrepresented as a New Age UFO cult. Chen was a former professor who claimed to be an atheist until he joined a religious cultivation group that dated back for two generations to the original female founder, Teacher Yu-Hsia Chen. But he broke with the group, headed by the third-generation teacher, in 1993 and created, with another fellow-cultivator, Tao-hung Ma, their own groups. It was later, when he broke with Ma and decided to move to the US, that new elements, such as the pseudo-scientific information of cosmology and flying saucers, as well as Christian motifs of the prophecy of the end and the great tribulation, etc., were introduced into the group. In Taiwan, the group was originally officially registered as the Chinese Soul Light Research Association. When the group moved to the United States from Asia, it was registered in the US as God's Salvation Church and first relocated to San Dimas, California. Adherents moved to Garland, Texas, in 1997.  Beliefs  This New Religious Movement was a mix of Buddhism, Taoism, and UFOlogy. It emphasized transmigration of souls (with three souls per person) and placed great emphasis on spiritual energy. Adherents also believed in \\"outside souls,\\" who basically acted as bad influences, or even as demons, in the human world. Chen believed that Earth went through five tribulations going back to the age of the dinosaurs. Each of these tribulations was survived by beings living in North America who were rescued by God in a flying saucer. He believed the solar system is 4.5 trillion years old, or roughly 300 times the age science gives for the Universe. He believed that the solar system was created by a nuclear war. Failed prophecy The group is best known for a highly publicized, and failed, millennial prophecy. Shortly after moving to Garland in August 1997, Chen predicted that at 12:01 a.m. on March 31, 1998, God would be seen on a single television channel all across North America. Whether or not the person had cable service was irrelevant to God's appearance on that channel. The group reportedly moved to Garland because the name sounded like \\"God Land.\\" At the time the group had roughly 160 members, 40 of which were children. Members purchased more than 20 homes in an upper-middle-class south Garland neighborhood. Like their neighbors, these followers were white-collar professionals, some of whom were reportedly wealthy. \\"They dressed in white, wore cowboy hats and drove luxury cars,\\" according to The Dallas Morning News. \\"They reportedly believed that two young boys in their group were the reincarnations of Jesus and Buddha. They told reporters they had come to Garland to watch God come to Earth and take human form at 10 a.m. on March 31, 1998, at the home of Mr. Chen, a former college professor.\\" The Garland Police Department, understanding the potential gravity of the situation, coordinated resources, including Southern Methodist University religious studies professor Lonnie Kliever, and were on stand-by when the international media began arriving in what had previously been an upper-middle-class section of the Dallas suburb. \\"Its presence unsettled many Garland residents,\\" wrote Adam Szubin in a law enforcement case study. \\"They did not understand the group's different style of dress and behavior, and many feared violence. Throughout the group's stay, the [police] department maintained contact with community members and informed them of investigation developments and contingency plans for the community's well being.\\" When the predicted appearance did not occur, the group became confused. \\"The Chen Tao leader announced that he obviously had misunderstood God's plans, and members quietly returned to their homes,\\" wrote Szubin. Chen offered to be stoned or crucified for the event, but no one took him up on this offer. He had earlier made a false prediction of finding a \\"Jesus of the West,\\" who would look like Abraham Lincoln.  Aftermath  Unlike other millennial religious groups, such as Millerites, Chen Tao seems to have effectively fallen apart after its leader's prophecies went unfulfilled. Immediately after the failed prediction, some of the members had to return to Taiwan owing to visa problems; in total, roughly two-thirds abandoned the group. Later the remaining members moved to Lockport, New York. They continued to wear cowboy hats but began stating that a war between China and Taiwan would lead to a nuclear holocaust that would result in much death, but also God's arrival in a \\"God plane\\" to save the members. They originally stated that this would occur in 1999, but later revised the date. Whether Chen Tao still exists is uncertain. The group entered a sharp decline after the failed prophecies, and virtually nothing was heard of it after 2001. The current whereabouts of Hon-Ming Chen are unknown.

It teaches law to undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as conducting legal research and holding conferences. There are approximately 700 undergraduate students and 150 postgraduate students in the Law School. It publishes the Dublin University Law Journal and the Trinity College Law Review. The Law School is located in House 39 on New Square. Degrees It offers five undergraduate degrees. The Bachelor in Laws (LL.B.), Law and French (the LL.B. (ling. franc.)), Law and German (the LL.B. (ling. germ.)), Law and Business (LL.B. Bus) and Law and Political Science (LL.B. Pol. Science) degrees are all four-year honors degree programmes in Law. The School offers five taught Master in Laws degrees. Applicants who already hold a good honors (II.1) law degree or law related degree, can apply to study for the LL.M. (Master in Laws), Master in International and Comparative Law, Master in International and European Business Law and Master in Intellectual Property Law. All four postgraduate degrees are one-year taught programmes. The School of Law also offers two postgraduate research degree programmes - the M.Litt. or Ph.D., which are conducted by research. Finally, the LL.D. is an honour reserved for outstanding legal academics. =The LL.B.= In the freshman years of the LL.B., students study eight obligatory core law subjects: *The Irish Legal System (including Legal Skills) *Torts *Constitutional law I *Criminal law *Contract law *Administrative Law *Private Law Remedies *Equity *Land law *European Union law *Constitutional law II Mentoring Freshman law students can also choose to take a language course in the university. Sophisters (third and fourth year students) choose 60 ECTs (European Credit Transfers) in each of the two years from a wide range of modules including commercial law, tax law, human rights law, corporate governance and criminology. They are also entitled to take a module in a different field under Trinity‚Äôs Broad Curriculum programme. The marks obtained over the two final years count equally for the final degree grade. Coursework Each module generally has three hours of lectures per week throughout the year. There are also seminars attended by groups of approximately twelve students. Freshman modules have four seminars of one hour in length throughout the year. For sophister subjects, the number of seminars varies. The Law School does not operate in semesters, so the examinations are all at the end of the year, in the May‚ÄìJune period. The only exception is the foundation scholarship exam, which Senior Freshmen may elect to sit in order to win a scholarship. Many subjects allocate part of the grade for a major assignment submitted during the year. International study Junior Sophisters may study abroad for their third year on an exchange. Trinity has both Socrates or Erasmus exchanges with European universities and other reciprocal exchange agreements with universities in Canada, Finland and the USA. The Law School has exchange agreements with the following universities: *Austria Johannes Kepler University, Linz *Belgium Leuven University *Canada Osgoode Hall Law School *Denmark University of Copenhagen *Finland University of Helsinki *France Montesquieu University ‚Äì Bordeaux IV University of Strasbourg University of Strasbourg University of Toulouse Panth√©on-Assas University University of Poitiers Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) *Germany University of Erlangen-Nuremberg Hamburg University Humboldt University, Berlin Mainz University University of W√ºrzburg Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich *Italy University of Bologna *The Netherlands Leiden University *Spain University of Granada *The United States of America Emory University Washington and Lee University Indiana University Maurer School of Law =The law and language degrees= The degrees in Law and French and Law and German were created in 1993. They are taught in conjunction with Trinity‚Äôs French and German departments. They are modelled on the LL.B., but also include study of the relevant language and civilisation and the civil and constitutional law of the relevant jurisdiction. It is obligatory for students on these courses to spend their third year on a Socrates exchange, where they study a range of law subjects in a French or German university. The marks obtained abroad count for 35% of a law and language student‚Äôs degree grade. There are traditionally twelve places every year on each of these courses, however sixteen places were offered on the Law and German programme and thirteen places for Law and French for the academic year 2007-8. It is unclear whether this arrangement is to continue. Staff The staff of the Law School includes a number of well-known Irish legal academics and authors of leading textbooks. The current Head of the Law School is Professor Oran Doyle. A number of lecturers, including Professor Ivana Bacik and William Binchy are known to the public for their involvement in political campaigns. Past holders of the Reid Professorship in Criminal Law, currently held by Ivana Bacik, include former Presidents of Ireland, Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese. Student societies A number of TCD student societies are particularly oriented towards law students. These are the Dublin University Law Society, FLAC (Free Legal Advice Centres) and the local branch of ELSA (European Law Students‚Äô Association). The Law Society publishes student articles in the Trinity College Law Review. Many law students are active in the Hist and Phil and participate in debates and mooting competitions, such as the European Law Moot Court.

His character opens the show with the trademark catchphrase, \\"Tell me what you don't like about yourself.\\" His partner, Christian Troy, has been his best friend since attending college together at the University of Miami, which is partly why they went into business together. Sean is portrayed as the more skilled, yet more troubled surgeon, who apparently specializes in craniofacial surgery. He is often plagued by family distresses involving his wife Julia and son Matt. The two also have a daughter, Annie, and a newborn son named Conor. Character history Sean formerly ran the McNamara/Troy plastic surgery clinic in Miami with his best friend, Christian Troy. He is nearing middle age and trying to come to terms with the choices he has made in his life; he believes that he went into plastic surgery to help repair the bodies of the deformed and the mutilated, but became sidetracked in performing vanity procedures. When the show begins, he is considering going into pro bono work. At the beginning of the series, Sean and Julia's marriage is slowly falling apart. At one point, Sean has an affair with one of his patients - Megan O'Hara, a breast cancer survivor who is separated from her husband. The affair continues until Sean confesses it to Matt and tries to break it off, but he feels obliged to Megan when her cancer returns. She decides she would rather commit suicide than go through chemotherapy, and asks Sean to help her go peacefully. Julia accompanies Sean to Megan's funeral where she realizes why he is so upset about her death. Sean and Julia work hard to try to salvage their marriage. In the middle of the second season, Julia learns that Matt is, in fact, Christian's biological son (the result of a one-night stand just prior to Julia and Sean's wedding). Though Sean eventually forgives Christian, he finds it difficult to do so for Julia, and the two separate. Around this time, a masked serial rapist begins terrorizing Miami, raping and mutilating fashion models. Referred to as \\"The Carver\\" by the media, he leaves deep cuts on both sides of his victims' mouths, resembling a smile. When McNamara/Troy begin performing pro bono surgery on his victims, the enraged killer targets Sean. Sean is eventually attacked by The Carver in his home, but is more fortunate than most of his victims; he receives only a single cut on his right cheek and is not raped. Quentin Costa, a surgeon from Atlanta, is called in to help Christian fix Sean's face. After Christian becomes a Carver victim himself, he finds it difficult to continue working. To pick up the slack, Sean offers Quentin a limited partnership, which he accepts. Christian is initially against the partnership, but eventually agrees to work with Quentin. During this time, Sean's life becomes even more chaotic. Julia files divorce papers and begins her own spa, and Christian is arrested in connection with the Carver rapes (and one murder). The Carver attacks while Christian is in jail, and Christian is set free. The incident greatly hurts business at McNamara/Troy, and Sean begins to question the cosmetic surgery business again. After an incident in which the doctors attempted to perform plastic surgery on an elderly woman in unfit condition for such a procedure, Sean quits the practice and joins the Witness Protection Program. He only performed one operation on a son and mother, with whom he then began to have a relationship. Finally choosing between leaving his old life behind and beginning a completely new one, he returns to the practice and ignites a bitter rivalry with Quentin, who has since begun dating his ex-wife. The rivalry ends with Quentin buying out the remainder of his contract and going to work at Julia's spa. Julia eventually fires Quentin, and discovers soon after that she is pregnant. Sean and Christian initially assume the child is Quentin's. However, Quentin, not knowing that Julia is pregnant, admits to Christian that the two never had sex. The child is now assumed to be Sean's, the result of a night the two spent together after their divorce. Sean's relationship with Matt could be salvageable, since Matt asked him to do pro bono work on Cherry Peck, a transgender person he beat up. Shortly after doing so, The Carver launched two more attacks, this time on a sorority house, and on Sean's rival, Quentin Costa. Sean agreed to fix Quentin after a heart- breaking speech, but he and Christian pay dearly for it, because The Carver sneaks up and drugs Sean, and then takes off the mask, revealing himself as none other than Quentin Costa. He then straps both Sean and Christian to the operating tables, plays mind games with them, and then cuts off one of Sean's fingers. Christian decides to sacrifice himself, or more specifically, his left hand to save Sean. Before that happens, Quentin is shot from behind by Kit McGraw, a police officer who had a brief relationship with Christian. However, she is also Quentin's sister and had been helping him commit the attacks. A microsurgeon saves Sean's finger. After giving up the property deed to his house to Julia, she decides to add his name to it, saying she'll only move back in if he's still living there. He agrees and they move in together again but their relationship is put to a strain after he discovers that his son is going to be born handicapped with ectrodactyly, commonly known as lobster claw syndrome. Furthermore, he later has sex with a potential nanny named Monica Wilder, but afterwards decided not to hire her after feeling guilty of cheating on Julia once again. Although he has no feelings for Monica and broke whatever they had off after she returned to him, she has no intentions of leaving Sean and will prove to be a threat to Sean and Julia's tenuous reunion. Despite not hiring Monica, she continues to involve herself in Sean's life by filling in as Conor's nanny when his regular nanny is hospitalized with food poisoning. After repeatedly telling her to leave, Monica confronts Sean at work and asks him to look at a possible infection to her nipple stemming from continuously attempting to breastfeed Conor. Sean contemplates killing Monica to prevent her from telling Julia of their affair, but is ultimately unable to and tells her to leave and that she should see a psychologist. Enraged, Monica tells Sean that she is going to tell the police that he raped her and thus destroy their marriage. Sean hurries after Monica, trying to talk some sense into her when she is killed in a freak accident when a bus hits her while crossing the road. When it got closer to the day of Conor's hand surgery, Sean faces several obstacles. First, Julia became more hesitant in even having the surgery done and with Marlowe's (Conor's nurse) encouragement, she refused to sign the consent forms. Additionally, Sean became more conscious of Conor's hands as a young boy makes fun of his condition, prompting him to insult the child's own physical appearance and punching the boy's father. Eventually, Sean settled everything with the father and realized that he was merely projecting his repressed anger from his own childhood, revealing to Julia that he was born with a cleft lip, which made him an object of ridicule (it should also be noted that his mother's decision to repair it secretly with Sean's college fund ultimately led to his father leaving the family). After discovering this, Julia agreed to the surgery and Sean was now more at ease with Conor's chance of living a normal life. However, Conor's infancy meant that both hands could not be operated on at the same time. Sean operated on only one of Conor's hands before Julia decided to cancel the second surgery and take Annie and Conor with her to New York, leaving Sean behind. Sean has sessions with psychologist Faith Wolper without Christian knowing. She tells him that Christian has had dreams about him. Sean tells Christian, and their relationship goes back to normal. Sean has sold his share of his partnership to Christian and Michelle claiming he needs to know if he can live without Christian. He moves to Los Angeles and gets a new job. However, Christian soon joins him. However life isn't easy in LA and they spend their first 2 months without any clients. Desperate they join a show as consults and guest-stars. While Christian is cut out due to bad acting, Sean's appearance allows him to be recognized on the streets and have some clients come. Going on with the show he begins a relationship with a fellow actress but they have some trouble when she reveals to be a former fat girl and asks him for an abdominoplasty, making her flee in Christian's arms although they later make up. He then meets and becomes obsessed with Olivia's daughter Eden. He then proposes to his new girlfriend Kate but when they try to spice up their sex lives they realize they are not made for each other. When Eden comes back from rehab, he kisses her. As their relationship goes further, Eden admits that she finds him too old, and their tryst had merely been a fling on her part. He gets advice on how to stay young without surgery from Aidan Stone and then goes to his party, where he ignores Eden to get her to want him. As they have sex he has an adverse reaction to MDMA, which lands him in a hospital where Christian and Julia learn about the affair, disgusting Julia. Sean's life is further complicated by his agent Colleen, who comes off as overly attached to Sean. When a rival agent shows interest in representing Sean, Colleen lures him to her apartment and kills him by force feeding him stuffing from teddy bears which she makes. Sean eventually learns that Colleen isn't a licensed agent, and breaks off ties with her despite her numerous attempts to contact him. He files a restraining order with her, but she still insists on being around him. Seeking revenge on Sean, she places the body of the dead agent in his room and apparently flees the country. Later, when Sean is at the office working on Annie who was recently involved in a car crash, Colleen sneaks into the office and repeatedly stabs Sean in the back leaving him on his back coughing in a pool of his own blood with Colleen staring down at him. Colleen apparently leaves him for dead. Not being able to move much, he tampers with the medical equipment that Annie is hooked up to in hopes of setting off an alarm to get help. He does so but Colleen returns and drags him off and locks him in a room with her. Liz hears Annie's machines going off and, after slipping in a pool of blood, yells for Christian who helps her with Annie then sets off to find Sean. While Colleen talks to Sean, he grabs the knife she dropped on the floor and stabs her with it, killing her. Christian then breaks the door down and finds Sean bleeding to death and tries to dial 911 but the phone does not work and he screams for Liz. Four months later Sean is alive and well, albeit using a wheelchair and unable to perform surgery due to nerve inflammations. He teaches at a prestigious plastic surgeon college as a way to make ends meet while Matt helps him with his rehabilitation regimens. At the end of the episode it is revealed that Sean can walk just fine and has been faking his paralysis, wanting to be the one taken care of instead of being the one having to take care of everyone else. After Liz leaves after her breakup with Christian, Sean becomes involved with Liz's replacement; an adventurous biker named Teddy. She tries to loosen Sean up, taking him to a restaurant that is completely pitch-black, breaking into an unsold house to have sex and experimenting with mind-altering drugs. Sean and Teddy later marry, unbeknownst to Sean that Teddy is really a \\"black widow\\" - a con artist and murderer who has preyed on several other doctors. However, Sean's life insurance policy only lists Annie and Connor as beneficiaries. In order to get the money, Teddy tries to kill all three of them on a camping trip by drugging them with sleeping pills and flooding the trailer with carbon monoxide. Annie wakes up, having not eaten the tainted s'mores, and wakes her father up who manages to get them out. Later, the police call Sean and tell him that a heart was found near the trailer and that the DNA matches samples taken from Teddy's hair. Sean learns that Teddy was planning to kill him and his children for the money, and bribed her attacker with the money. At first he doesn't believe this; it is only later with the police show him 4 other victims of Teddy's that he comes to accept it. He dumps Teddy's cremated remains in a trash can as well as his wedding ring before attempting to commit suicide via drowning. Sean has a change of heart and is rescued by the Coast Guard and undergoes therapy from Julia's mother, who attempts to use this incident to take custody of Annie and Connor in order to have a family with her young boyfriend. However, she discovers him masturbating into a pair of Annie's panties and kicks him out, and drops the suit against Sean and Julia. Sean's self-esteem is damaged further when he encounters a former med student friend who is now involved in a \\"Doctors without Borders\\" program, which Sean envies at a conference in which him and Christian are being honored. When he finds out that the award they are receiving is because Christian made a huge donation to the school, he decides to join his friend's program having had enough of Christian's egocentricism. While his friend is out of the country, Sean becomes friends with his wife who tries to seduce him due to her husband being gone most of the time and having to tend to her needs. Sean refuses, but is kicked from the program when his friend confronts him saying that his wife told them that they had had sex and that \\"You and Christian deserve each other\\". This appears to be the last straw for Sean, who starts to pull away and distance himself from Christian who he has begun to blame for the way his life has turned out. Towards the end of season six, Christian and Sean return to being as they describe \\"brothers\\". Soon enough, Sean is shaken by Julia's visit to Los Angeles, where she announces that she is moving to England with her fiancee, Edmund, and requests to take Annie and Conor with her. Later at Matt and Ramona's wedding (where Matt leaves Ramona at the altar for Ava), Sean agrees to sign the papers for Julia's satisfaction. In the final episode, Christian sits Sean down at the consult desk, asking Sean what he didn't like about himself. Sean is surprised Christian would ask him such a question, and replies that he is perfectly happy with his new life. Christian, however, knows better and tells Sean he is dissolving the partnership (after a dream where Kimber appears in his bedroom and ridicules him for his actions, and reveals she killed herself to escape him, and believes that Sean might do the same if he remains at McNamara/Troy since Christian's lifestyle destroys everyone around him) Christian gifts Sean with two one way plane tickets to leave the country with Raphael (Ava's abandoned orphan whom Sean and Christian operated on) where Sean can perform pro bono work on people in lesser countries, like he had dreamed. Sean accepts the gift, and leaves the office to see a new sign on the foyer, \\"Troy/Cruz\\". Christian drops Sean off at the airport with Raphael and through security, TSA asks if Raphael is Sean's son. Without pondering, he says yes. Sean's appearance ends with him looking back at Christian. =Future (Sean's dream)= In the flash forwards of episode 'Conor McNamara, 2026' when Julia sees Sean she asks how his second wife is doing indicating Sean eventually remarries. Sean, however, tells her not to ask him about his personal life giving no further details. Conor, aged 20, decides to go through with the surgery on his other hand with Matt as his primary surgeon and Sean in the operating room assisting. In the Season 5: part two premiere, Ronny Chase, Sean reveals that the events of Conor McNamara, 2026 was a dream he had during his break-up with Julia.

He played five Test matches for England against Australia, South Africa & New Zealand in the mid-1960s. Rumsey played county cricket for Worcestershire, Somerset and Derbyshire. Life and career Born 4 December 1935, Stepney, London, UK, Rumsey began his first-class career for Worcestershire against Cambridge University in 1960, his first wicket being that of future England captain Tony Lewis. He made a few more appearances over the next two years, but was largely confined to second-eleven cricket and for the 1963 season until he moved to Somerset. For six seasons Rumsey was a fixture in the Somerset side, taking a total of 547 first-class wickets at an average of 20.14, and in three seasons (1963, 1965 and 1966) reaching the 100-wicket mark. His best achievements came in 1965, when he took 8‚Äì26 against Hampshire in a low-scoring game in which only 283 runs were scored for the loss of 33 wickets. He took 119 first-class wickets that season at an average of only 16.18, taking five or more in an innings on seven occasions. As one of the fastest bowlers ever to play for Somerset Rumsey had made his Test debut in 1964 against Australia at Manchester, his 2‚Äì99 from 35.5 overs fairly impressive in a match in which Australia piled up 656 for 8 declared, thanks to 311 from Bob Simpson (indeed, both sides passed 600 in their first innings); he was, however, not retained for the fifth Test at the Oval. In 1965, Rumsey played in all three Tests against the New Zealanders, taking a career-best 4‚Äì25 in the second Test at Lord's and claiming nine at 25.44 in the series as a whole. He kept his place in the team for the first Test against South Africa in late July, but despite six wickets in the match this was to prove his last appearance for England. During the winter of 1967/68, Somerset appointed Rumsey public relations and fund raising officer. It was the first appointment of its type in English first-class cricket. Fred Rumsey's greatest contribution to cricket came in 1967 when he founded the Professional Cricketers‚Äô Association. Before the creation of the PCA English Cricket players had little to no say in the administration of the game in England & Wales. Rumsey's creation of a players union was recognised when the PCA recently appointed him Honorary Life Founder Member and a Vice-President. In 1969, Rumsey moved counties again, from Somerset to Derbyshire where he played one day cricket and again operated as Fund Raiser and Public Relations officer. He was to remain at Derbyshire until his retirement after the 1973 season, making just one first-class appearance in those five seasons (against his old county of Somerset at Bath in 1970) but making many appearances in the limited-overs game. In 1970, he achieved his best one-day figures of 4‚Äì8 against Worcestershire at Derby, and in all he took 100 List A wickets at 18.44 for Derbyshire. Rumsey was awarded a Derbyshire cap in 1972. Rumsey's final game was against Nottinghamshire in the John Player League on 9 September 1973. After retirement he became involved with the Lord's Taverners, and appeared in charity matches and other events. His friendships included the anti-apartheid campaigner Donald Woods, John Arlott, Eric Morecambe, Colin Milburn and David Gower. In 2008 Fred Rumsey was honoured by Somerset supporters when they selected him as a 'Legend' of the Cricket Club having taken over 570 first-class wickets in 6 seasons. He published his autobiography Sense of Humour, Sense of Justice in April 2019.

It was built in the 1550s, and played a significant role in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. Following the siege, it was rebuilt as Saint Michael Cavalier (), and was completed in 1581. The cavalier was partially demolished in the 20th century, and only a part of its base still exists today.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/51888/21/Orizzont_Dawra%20kulturali%20mal- Port%20il-Kbir%20%2821%29.PDF Construction and history In 1537 d‚ÄôHomedes renovated a villa and surrounded it with a casemate. In 1551, the Ottomans attacked Malta and later invaded Gozo. This prompted the Order's Grand Master, Juan de Homedes y Coscon, to strengthen the defences of the island. Two new forts were needed, one on the Sciberras Peninsula, and one on the smaller peninsula then known as Isola di San Michele, which was formed by Dockyard Creek and French Creek in Grand Harbour. The first stone of the fort on l'Isola was laid on 8 May 1552 by de Homedes himself. The fort was built to a design by the military engineer Pedro Pardo d‚ÄôAndrera. The second fort, located on the Sciberras Peninsula, was called Fort Saint Elmo.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/155235432.pdf Photo of the Senglea land front in 1846, with St Michael Cavalier partially visible at the extreme left The fort was extended to a fortified city named Senglea by Grand Master Claude de la Sengle during the Knights' preparations for the anticipated Great Siege of Malta. The siege eventually came in 1565, and St Michael was one of three forts defending the Knights stronghold in Grand Harbour, along with Fort St Angelo and Fort St Elmo. The latter fell, but Fort St Michael and Fort St Angelo both withstood the siege. Fort St Michael was severely damaged, as it had been the scene of some of the most desperate fighting of the siege. It withstood 10 assaults from the Ottoman attackers. The fortifications of Senglea was rebuilt after the siege, and the redevelopment continued until 1581. Fort St. Michael was converted to a cavalier, consisting of a tower with a casemated interior, which had a terrace platform with ten embrasures. In 1687, Don Carlos de Grunenberg visited the fort and recommended the addition of a faussebraye. He decided to finance the expenses himself. Destruction The clock tower and school, with the remains of the cavalier used as the clock tower's base St. Michael Cavalier was largely dismantled in 1921 to make way for a school. A small part of the structure's lower section was retained and was used as the base of a clock tower. Today, the bastion at Senglea Point, which is known as \\"the Spur\\", is often mistakenly referred to as Fort Saint Michael, although the fort was actually located at the opposite end of the city.

First published in 2000 by Viking Press in the United Kingdom it stays within the comedy, science fiction genre. The narrative is set on a spaceship sent on a voyage to colonise another planet, since Earth has been rendered uninhabitable. The mission is set to take numerous generations. Ten generations into the voyage, however, the crew's mental abilities have all been severely reduced, setting the events of the novel in motion. Plot summary The story starts on Earth in the future. Global warming and over population has caused an imminent apocalypse. The hope for the survival of the human race is a spaceship called the Willflower, which will take a small number of the world's best minds on a journey to colonize another planet. Eddie O'Hare, the protagonist, is not one of them. He is deep in debt due to his computer having mysteriously stolen several million dollars online, then sending it to an unknown location. As such, he decides to gamble what money he has left in the hope of getting enough to pay back the debts. On his way to the casino, he meets a pink-socked assassin who he fears may have been sent to kill him. It turns out that he has not (or at least, Eddie is not the man's current target). When gambling the last of his money, Eddie wins- thanks to him mimicking the gambling decisions of a man who looks uncannily like himself-, but the casino is no longer operational; due to the Willflower's imminent departure, the town (which was created only to house people working on the project), is closing down, and the casino has already lost all its money to the other man. He leaves and decides to hide. Whilst doing so, he happens to meet the man whose luck he 'piggy-backed' on earlier. He discovers that the other man, Charles Perry Gordon, is due to go on the Willflower but doesn't want to go now that he was won such a vast amount of money. Due to the ramifications for the rest of his family Gordon cannot refuse to leave, so he offers Eddie a place in place of himself. Eddie successfully smuggles himself on board (Unaware that Gordon had intended to sell him out as an impostor once the ship took off and it was too late for him to join the mission, only for Gordon to be killed by the hitmen he hired to simulate Eddie's alleged 'assault' because they had also been hired by the casino staff to get the money back). As Gordon's job is the community planner, Eddie reads the plans so far to learn more about his job and discovers that the man he is replacing has enforced a fascist, totalitarian system: crew members are paired for life before they are even born, and jobs- even unpleasant ones such as prostitution- are inherited. However, shortly after the ship sets off he is murdered by an unknown assailant. The story then jumps forward several generations. Eddy is revived as a cyborg with only his head and spinal column remaining of his original body, and trapped forever in a jar of green slime (Even worse, the nerve endings are incorrectly wired, so that, for example, he moves his right arm when trying to move his left foot). He finds himself on a ship full of idiots and that there is something going wrong with the ship; all but one of its engines are gone and it has only 20% of its manoeuvring thrusters. The ship needs to land soon, but only three planets are available: Thrrrppp, which is the most habitable but with no way for the ship to enter orbit, Penis, which the ship has a 50% chance of docking with but is covered in volcanoes, and Panties, which is totally hostile but has a 90% chance of docking. As the only intelligent life form on board it is up to him to find out what is happening. As he explores the ship, he meets more of the ship's mentally retarded crew, none of which have even the slightest ability to perform their jobs. He is puzzled by this, the fact that the crew is totally illiterate and, most importantly, the fact that the ship, which has been shown to be able to self-repair itself if it takes damage, has not done so. The ship is also on a collision course with a massive gas giant which does not appear on the radar system. The ship's less than moral priest attempts to leave in the nuclear-powered escape pod, but fails thanks to the captain overriding the system. Eddie decides to cause the escape pod to self-destruct in the hope that the explosion will force the ship towards planet Thrrrppp. This fails when the priest steals the pod- accompanied by some of the ship's prostitutes to help him 'rebuild' human society, destroying the remaining engines in the process. Eddy is forced to leave the ship and go and see what is happening. Outside, he is drawn back into the ship by an unknown force. He encounters the assassin from the beginning of the novel, who was revived in another survival suit but driven completely homicidally insane by the process, still intent on fulfilling his centuries-old contract (At the same time, Eddie has a flashback where he realises that the original Father Lewis killed him to stop him spreading 'his' mad plans any further). Before he can do so, however, the ship kills him. It then talks to Eddy and reveals what has been happening. Its internal self-repair systems, it transpires, were also capable of self- modification, eventually becoming self-aware. Realizing the madness that the original crew had instigated, it made the crew members illiterate to erase all memory of the old system. It has also gained the ability to time travel into the past, where it can affect electronics, but not take a physical form. Back on Earth, humanity has become extinct; the crew of the Willflower are all that is left. The ship had selected Eddie to look after the crew as he was the only person with sufficiently low self-esteem to survive the cybernetic revival system; the sheer horror of the suit would have driven anyone else insane, but Eddie expected so little out of life that he actually came through the process as a better person. The ship causes Eddy's computer to steal the money (instigating the series of events that caused Eddie to arrive on the ship), then repairs itself and flies the crew to planet Thrrrppp. First paperback edition cover Characters in \\"Colony\\" ;Eddie O'Hare : An accountant posing as a community planner and, a few generations later, mistaken for a doctor and resurrected in an egg-like robot suit with nerve endings incorrectly connected (to the extent that the nerves controlling his new body's right hand should control a muscle in his anus). He believes himself to be the unluckiest man ever (and in the words of the novel: \\"bluntly, he's got a damn point\\"). Despite the contempt with which he is regarded, the rest of the crew come to subconsciously see him as a leader. ;Paolo San Pablos : A hitman with a penchant for pink socks. A homicidal maniac, allegedly known to resort to spree murder as an anti-boredom device, he stowed away on the Willflower to kill Eddie as part of a contract, but was caught and put in suspended animation before he was revived. The revival procedure caused him to go insane, brutally disembowelling several people before the ship neutralises him. ;Bernadette Oslo : A member of the Willflower's crew; although her precise role on the ship is unclear, her nagging familiarity to Eddie, coupled with his asexual fondness for her, suggests that she may be his own descendant. ;Father Lewis : The ship's priest, although, by his own admission, his career is difficult due to his atheism (jobs are inherited, preventing him from changing roles). A fan of pornography, he possesses several video tapes of the women's shower room. He has installed a network of cameras throughout the ship, partly to gain more pornographic material but also to spy on people. He is not above blackmailing people with these images. Towards the end of the novel, he escapes the Willflower in the one remaining functional escape pod, taking the ship's prostitutes with him. ;Styx : Clones of the original security chief. Incredibly stupid, mainly due to the mental deterioration involved in every new batch of drones (they are described in the blurb as \\"having the mental agility of pond life\\"), most people simply treat the drones as equipment, with Eddie being the sole exception. Each Styx drone has a letter branded on his forehead and a name beginning with this letter to distinguish between them. The Styx drones are dangerously enthusiastic about their jobs, with one drone even accidentally killing himself by firing his laser rifle at a door on the maximum power setting at point blank range. ;Trinity Peck : The Willflower's science officer, who unfortunately, is in fact a religious fanatic who reacts to danger by beating herself with a whip while naked to punish herself for not noticing the problem earlier. She regards Eddie as an agent of the Devil. ;Captain Gwent : A spotty teenager who names planets after bodily functions and parts (specifically, \\"Thrrrppp\\", \\"Penis\\", \\"Panties\\", and \\"Jockstrap\\") and appears totally unconcerned about the fact that he is meant to be in charge of the mission (His father died under unspecified circumstances shortly before Eddie's revival). He is totally incompetent as a leader, but nobody seems to try and remove him from power, mainly because jobs are inherited and nobody knows who is meant to take the captain's place in this situation. ;Captain Berwick Gwent : The original captain of the mission. Refers to himself as \\"Community Director\\", speaks ridiculously loudly and makes \\"jokes\\" in Latin. In terms of age, he is described as either \\"a well preserved sixty or a gone to seed forty with inadequate access to hair dye\\". ;Amalgam Willard-Walters aka The Professors: Two bitter rivals whose minds have been merged into one body. They have been put in cryogenic storage, as they have been constantly arguing and attempting to commit suicide. Reception Received initial very well by the SciFi buying public the novel continued to sell strongly into following years. By March 2002 it had sold more than 22,500 copies.

Cranial placodes include a diverse range of structures found across chordates, but the neurogenic placodes found in vertebrates arose later in evolution. In humans The cranial placodes that have neurogenic potential (i.e. give rise to neurons) can be divided into two groups, the dorsolateral placodes and the epibranchial placodes. * dorsolateral placodes includes:  The trigeminal placode, which consists of ophthalmic and maxillomandibular parts, and gives rise to the cells of the trigeminal ganglion  The otic placode forms the otic pit and the otic vesicle, giving rise eventually to organs of hearing and equilibrium. * The epibranchial or epipharyngeal placodes generate the distal portion of the ganglia of cranial nerves VII, IX and X:  The geniculate placode, associated with the first pharyngeal groove, generates the geniculate ganglion and distal parts of cranial nerve VII  The petrosal placode, associated with the second pharyngeal groove, generates the inferior ganglion of glossopharyngeal nerve and distal parts of cranial nerve IX  The nodosal placode, associated with the third branchial cleft, generates the nodose ganglion and distal parts of cranial nerve X * The olfactory placode (or nasal placode) gives rise to the olfactory epithelium of the nose. * The cranial placodes that do not give rise to neurons are:  The lens placode under the direction of the optic vesicle gives rise to the lens of the eye.  The adenohypophyseal placode, which forms the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.  Other animals * The profundal placode, corresponding to the ophthalmic lobe of the trigeminal complex. In Xenopus this remains partly unfused. * In aquatic vertebrates, the lateral line placodes, which give rise to the lateral line system. * The hypobranchial placodes, a neurogenic placode found in some amphibians of unknown function  Other ectodermal placodes  The term placode or ectodermal placode is sometimes used to refer specifically to cranial or neurogenic placodes, but is also used for areas of the ectoderm that give rise to structures such as mammary glands, feathers and hair.

Several of his novels were made into films. Where the Boys Are, and The Shootist, which was John Wayne's last work, are probably the best known. Early life Glendon Swarthout was the only child of Fred and Lila (Chubb) Swarthout, a banker and a homemaker. Swarthout is a Dutch name; his mother's maiden name was from Yorkshire. Swarthout generally did well in school, especially in English. He was a Michigan high-school debate champion. In math, however, he floundered, and only a kindly lady geometry teacher passed him with a D, so he could graduate from Lowell, Michigan High School. He took accordion lessons and occupied his free time with books, for at 6 feet, 99 pounds, he was not good at sports. The summer of his junior year, he got a job playing his instrument in the resort town of Charlevoix, on Lake Michigan, with Jerry Schroeder and his Michigan State College Orchestra, for $10 per week . Graduating in 1935, he relocated to Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan (UM). He became more seriously involved in music, forming and singing lead for a four-piece band that played for hops and for three consecutive summers at the Pantlind Hotel in Grand Rapids, the largest hotel in Michigan outside of Detroit. Glendon majored in English at the UM, pledged Chi Phi, and dated Kathryn Vaughn, whom he had met when he was 13 and she 12, at her family's cottage on Duck Lake, outside of Albion, Michigan. They were married on December 28, 1940, after both had graduated from UM and Swarthout was writing advertising copy for Cadillac and Dow Chemical at the MacManus, John and Adams advertising agency in Detroit. Beginning writer After a year in the advertising business, Swarthout decided the way to become a writer was to see the world as a journalist. He signed as a stringer for 22 small newspapers and travelled with his bride on a small freighter to South America, sending home a weekly column of their adventures. While in Barbados, they heard Pearl Harbor had been bombed and tried immediately to get to the States, but they needed five roundabout months avoiding German U-boats to cruise the East Coast to Manhattan. Wartime Swarthout was ineligible for Officer Candidate School because he was underweight at 117 pounds. The couple both went to work at Willow Run, the new bomber plant outside of Ann Arbor. Working long days as a riveter on B-24s, he wrote his first novel at night in six months. Willow Run, a story about people working in a bomber factory, was published after a rewrite to mediocre reviews. He always saw this book as his training novel. Glendon Swarthout at home in Scottsdale, Arizona He was fit enough for an infantry company, however, as the war wore on, and he enlisted in the Army and was sent to Naples as a replacement for the 3rd Division. Awaiting the Anzio breakout on the beach in Italy, he was transferred to division headquarters. The 3rd Division moved out of Anzio and captured Rome, and Swarthout later landed in the second wave at St. Tropez and saw his only combat for six days, getting eyewitness statements for a few posthumous Medals of Honor as the unit moved rapidly north into France. When the 3rd Division was about to invade Germany, Swarthout ruptured a disc in his spine while unloading a truck. He was shipped home a sergeant and eventually discharged without surgery. Glendon suffered back pain for the rest of his life and received military disability. He eventually had back surgery in Arizona in his 50s on two imploded spinal discs. Postwar Swarthout returned to UM, earned a master's degree, and began teaching college. During that time, his son Miles was born and he won a Hopwood Award for $800 for another novel, promoting him to the University of Maryland for a few years, where he ghost-wrote speeches for Congressmen and wrote more unpublished fiction. That autumn, he began teaching at Michigan State University and during eight years in East Lansing earned his PhD in Victorian literature in 1955, while his wife got her master's degree and a teaching certificate and commenced teaching children in the second grade. Swarthout also began to sell short stories to national publications such as Cosmopolitan and The Saturday Evening Post. He was paid $2500 in 1955 for one of these stories, \\"A Horse for Mrs. Custer\\", which became a Randolph Scott low-budget Western for Columbia Pictures in 1956, under the title 7th Cavalry. The day after he finished his last doctoral examination, he started writing a novel called They Came To Cordura. Its setting was Mexico of 1916 during the Pershing Expedition to capture Pancho Villa, and some of its fictional cavalry troopers had been nominated for Medals of Honor. The book was quickly sold to Random House and then to Columbia Pictures in 1958, becoming one of their major motion pictures starring Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth a year later. This NY Times bestseller and the movie money enabled Swarthout to become a professional writer at last. He was 39 years old. He completed another novel while teaching Honors English at Michigan State. Where the Boys Are (1960) was set on the Michigan State campus and was the first comic novel about the annual \\"spring break\\" invasion of the beaches of southern Florida by America's college students. MGM's quick movie version, Where the Boys Are (1960), became the highest-grossing low-budget movie in the studio's history. Swarthout went on to write many more novels, some of which were made into movies. He worked on the screenplay of only one, Cordura, at Columbia Pictures in Los Angeles for six months, before moving from Michigan to Arizona, where he continued to teach English at Arizona State University for four years before retiring to write full time. Many of his novels were set in either Michigan or Arizona, and some used his war experiences. Several other works were sold for films that were never made; these include The Eagle and the Iron Cross (Sam Spiegel, 1968) and The Tin Lizzie Troop (Paul Newman, 1977), as well as a number of movie options, now lapsed, on his many stories. Besides a Hopwood Award and a Theatre Guild Award for his one play, Swarthout was twice nominated by his publishers for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (for They Came To Cordura by Random House and Bless The Beasts & Children by Doubleday), he received an O. Henry Prize Short Story nomination (in 1960 for \\"A Glass of Blessings\\"), a Gold Medal from the National Society of Arts and Letters in 1972, won Spur Awards for Best Western Novel of the Year from the Western Writers of America for The Shootist (1976) and The Homesman, a Wrangler Award for Best Western Novel of 1988 for The Homesman from the Western Heritage Association, and finally the Western Writers' Owen Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum (previously known as National Cowboy Hall of Fame) in Oklahoma City in June 1991. The Shootist was the basis of John Wayne's final film in 1976 and has since come to be recognized as a classic Western film and one of the Duke's very best. His British publisher (Secker & Warburg) claimed Swarthout had \\"the widest writing range\\" of any American novelist. From gunfighting Westerns The Shootist to the first of \\"the beach pictures,\\" Where the Boys Are, from satires such as The Cadillac Cowboys, to tragedies such as Welcome to Thebes, or his adventure novel about the Pershing Expedition into Mexico, They Came to Cordura, or a mystery/thriller such as Skeletons, even a period romance such as Loveland, or an animal rights/environmental tale such as Bless the Beasts & Children, science fiction was about the only literary genre he did not attempt. Glendon was inducted into the Western Writers Hall of Fame at its convention in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2008. The WWA's Hall of Fame is in the library of the famous Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody, Wyoming. Swarthout, a lifelong smoker, died of emphysema in his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, on September 23, 1992. Significance Swarthout, like most of his contemporaries, was affected by the Great Depression and World War II, which in turn influenced his 16 novels, particularly those set in the Midwest. Welcome to Thebes (1962), Loveland (1968), and Pinch Me, I Must Be Dreaming (1994) depict how the problems of adults affect their children, especially youth trying to adapt to an adult world. Although They Came to Cordura (1958) is set in Mexico at the time of the 1916 border dispute with Pancho Villa, its analysis of the nature of courage was influenced by Swarthout's wartime experiences. Teaching freshman honors English classes gave Swarthout insight into the mating rituals of college students on the beaches of Fort Lauderdale during spring break, and his hit Where the Boys Are (1960) definitely presaged the antiwar protests that occurred on American college campuses later in the decade. A Christmas Gift (1977, also known as The Melodeon) is an exception to Glendon's other work in several respects. It suggests a farewell tribute to his Michigan ancestors and his awareness of their tradition of understanding and concern for others. With the conspicuous exception of A Christmas Gift, all of Swarthout's novels are infused with a sardonic spirit, usually in respect to examples of the cruelty and viciousness of which man is capable. His greatest bestseller, Bless the Beasts and Children, is a good example of this distinguishing literary trait. Another common theme of his writings is his study of courage, the extraordinary heroism of which otherwise common, ordinary men are sometimes capable, given the right circumstances. In setting free a doomed herd of buffalo, the group of mentally disturbed teenagers in Beasts demonstrates valor during harrowing conditions. The style of Swarthout's writing is fundamentally dispassionate, however, and written in a clear, linear, pictorial style, which is why so many of his stories were adapted easily to film. Swarthout was a great admirer of Somerset Maugham (with whom he studied, along with Ernest Hemingway and Joyce Cary as part of his doctoral thesis in literature) and humorist Charles Portis, who influenced his writing. Family Glendon and Kathryn Swarthout at home in Scottsdale, Arizona =Kathryn Swarthout= Kathryn (1919-2015),Kathryn Blair Swarthout: Obituary the wife of Glendon and mother of Miles, was a former elementary school teacher for five years at Red Cedar School in East Lansing, Michigan, after earning her master's in education at Michigan State University, and bachelor of arts in English from the University of Michigan. She co-wrote six young-adult novels with her husband; several of them have been published overseas. Kathryn was a columnist for Woman's Day magazine with her free-form poetry, Lifesavors, which ran in the magazine for over 20 years. Some of these columns were published in a book of the same title by Doubleday in 1982. In 1962, Glendon and Kathryn established the Swarthout Writing Prizes at Arizona State University, administered by the English Department in Tempe. These six prizes in both poetry and fiction (with a current top prize of $1500 in each category), have grown until they now rank among the five highest awards financially for undergraduate and graduate writing programs given annually at any college or university in America. Miles Swarthout at a book signing =Miles Swarthout= Miles (1946-2016)Miles Hood Swarthout: Obituary was a screenwriter and author living in Playa Del Rey, California, near the beach and LAX. He received a Writers Guild nomination for Best Adaptation for The Shootist in 1976 (the film starred John Wayne and Lauren Bacall). He had adapted a number of his father's novels into films, among them A Christmas to Remember for CBS in 1978, which starred Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards, and Eva Marie Saint. As a journalist, Miles wrote a Hollywood Western film column for the Western Writers of America's bi-monthly magazine, The Roundup. He won a Stirrup Award from that organization for \\"The Duke's Last Ride, the Making of The Shootist,\\" the best article to appear in that publication in 1994. Miles Swarthout also wrote several articles for Persimmon Hill, the quarterly magazine of the National Cowboy Hall of Fame, among them \\"The Westerns of Glendon Swarthout\\" in the special summer issue from 1996, \\"Hollywood and the West\\", as well as in the sequel to this best-selling issue for spring 2000, \\"America's First Cinema Cowboy: William S. Hart\\". Miles edited the only volume of his late father's 14 short stories, Easterns and Westerns, which included an extensive overview of Glendon's literary career. Michigan State University Press published Easterns and Westerns in hardcover in the summer of 2001. Miles Swarthout also wrote The Sergeant's Lady, based upon one of his late father's old short stories, and this new novel won the Spur Award from the Western Writers as the Best First Western Novel of 2004. The Last Shootist, his sequel to his father's novel, was named 2014's Best Western Novel by the editors of True West magazine.

Governor Weld first used the phrase in reference to the colony finally gaining representative government in 1870. When Governor Frederick Broome turned the first sod on the Great Southern Railway at Beverley on 20 October 1886, he again used the phrase, presumably as an allusion to Weld's earlier use. In October 1890, Governor Robinson returned from England with the news that Western Australia had been granted responsible government. On his arrival at Albany on 18 October 1890, he made a speech in which he used the phrase: \\"now I think we can venture to say, with all sincerity, and in the full conviction that it will be realised, 'At last she moves.'\\" Three days later, responsible government was proclaimed in Perth, Western Australia. The city had been decorated in anticipation of celebration of the first Proclamation Day, and one of the highlights was a large banner draped across the front of Edward Keane's store, which read \\"\\" in all capital letters.

MI students can earn Certificates and ‚Äì with transfer of coursework taken at Los Angeles City College ‚Äì Associate of Arts Degrees, as well as Bachelor of Music Degrees in either Performance or Composition. The college was founded in 1977. History =Founders Howard Roberts and Pat Hicks= Musicians Institute was founded as The Guitar Institute of Technology in 1977 as a one-year vocational school of guitarists and bassists. Its curriculum and pedagogical style was shaped by guitarist Howard Roberts (1929‚Äì1992). Pat Hicks (n√© Patrick Carroll Hicks; born 1934), a Los Angeles music industry entrepreneur, was the co-founder of Musicians Institute. He is credited for providing the organizational structure and management that rapidly transformed Howard Roberts' educational philosophy into a major music school. Programs added under Roberts and Hicks include: * 1978: Bass Institute of Technology (BIT) * 1980: Percussion Institute of Technology (PIT) * 1987: Vocal Institute of Technology (VIT) * 1991: Keyboard Institute of Technology (KIT) * 1993: Recording Institute of Technology (RIT) * 1994: Bachelor of Music Degree =Early curricular offerings= At the time of its founding, formal education in rock and roll at institutions of higher learning was limited mostly to universities and conservatories offering jazz studies, which were few. At the founding of the Musicians Institute, Jazz studies was, and is today, a strong component of the curricular offerings. In early days of the Musicians Institute, the demand for musicians and music industry professionals with comprehensive collegiate credentials in the field of contemporary music was low. Yet, the demand for contemporary music professionals was high. Roberts, when he founded the school, wanted to give aspiring rock and roll musicians a conservatory experience. Nowadays, comprehensive music education in higher education, from bachelors to doctorates, covers rock and roll from several perspectives, including literature, musicology, history, performing arts, technology, business, and law. For musicians working towards degrees in performance, proficiency in rock and roll is standard, particularly for aspiring session musicians. The rise of contemporary musicians holding comprehensive academic credentials over the last 50 years is partly the result of more universities offering programs in the field, which, in turn, has increased the demand for contemporary oriented music educators with academic credentials at universities. Because the Musicians Institute was an innovator in rock and roll in higher education ‚Äì and years ago began offering bachelor of music degrees ‚Äì its alumni are well-represented as educators of contemporary music at institutions of higher learning. Japanese businessman Hisatake Shibuya (born 1937) bought the school in 1994 and Musicians Institute began developing new programs to keep abreast of the modern music industry. Programs added under Shibuya include: * 2000: Independent Artist Program (IAP) * 2000: Audio Engineering * 2000: Guitar Craft Academy (GCA) * 2002: Music Business Program (MBP) * 2016: DJ Performance and Production (DJP) * 2016: Associate of Science in Music Business (AS.MB) * 2017: MI Online (MIO) * 2018: Artist Producer and Entrepreneur (APE) * 2018: Master in Music Degree (MM) On 25 August 2007, the Los Angeles City Council adopted a resolution declaring 25 August 2007, \\"Musicians Institute Day in the City of Los Angeles\\" in recognition of its achievements over three decades during its 30th anniversary celebration. The resolution was presented by Eric Garcetti, seconded by Tom LaBonge, and passed by a vote of twelve to zero out of fifteen, three being absent. = Former institutional and division names = Active names * MI College of Contemporary Music‚Ñ¢ (service mark & trade mark) * MI Connects‚Ñ¢ (service mark) ‚Äì online talent resource for students and alumni * MI Musicians Institute‚Ñ¢ * Guitar Craft Academy‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì for the design, construction, and maintenance of guitars and basses Trademark names of Campus Hollywood * Tricycle Entertainment‚Ñ¢ (service mark ‚Äì abandoned in 2004) Former names * Guitar Institute of Technology (service mark ‚Äì became inactive 22 June 1990) * Vocal Institute of Technology (service mark ‚Äì became inactive 19 May 1989) * Bass Institute of Technology * Percussion Institute of Technology * Keyboard Institute of Technology * Recording Institute of Technology (trademark ‚Äì became inactive 5 December 2005) * Film Institute of Technology (trademark ‚Äì became inactive 5 December 2005) * Encore Program * World Institute of Percussion (launched in 1987) Trademark notes  Academics  The Musicians Institute offers instrumental performance programs for bass, drums, guitar, keyboard technology, and vocals. Music industry programs include audio engineering, Independent Artist Program, the Guitar Craft Academy and Music Business. The school offers Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, and Bachelor of Music degrees in addition to certificates. The Institute of International Education, in its assessment of \\"Top 40 Specialized Institutions, 2009/10,\\" from its publication, International Students: Leading Institutions by Institutional Type, ranked Musicians Institute 13 in the United States out of 40. Musicians Institute and its programs are registered by the state of California by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. It has been an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) since 1981. In 1992, new musicologist Robert Walser cited the Musicians Institute as one of the best-known schools for guitarist, one that has flourished outside the ivory tower, offering students broader professional training. But a trade-off, according to a review in the October 2012 issue of Performer Magazine, is that a lack of academic accreditation ‚Äì specifically from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges ‚Äì can make it challenging for students to transfer credits from MI to academic institutions. To meet the academic criteria for a Bachelor of Music Degree ‚Äì 45 quarter units or 30 semester units in liberal arts ‚Äì the Musicians Institute has a partnership with nearby Los Angeles City College (LACC) to study English, mathematics, natural science, social science, and humanities. LACC is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges The Carnegie Foundation has designated the Musicians Institute as a \\"Special Focus Institute in Music.\\"  Facilities and constituent institutions  Facilities When MI celebrated its 30th Anniversary in 2007, its facilities included over 75,000 square feet of studios, performance venues, classrooms, and practice rooms across several blocks in central Hollywood. , the Musician's Institute Stage was added as a venue for the Annual Mayhem Festival. December 2013, The ESP Company, LTD, unveiled plans to expand its Campus Hollywood complex of schools in Los Angeles. From 2010 to 2013, ESP invested $47 million in new property and will expand its facility to exceed 180,000 square feet of adjoining buildings on or near Highland Avenue between Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Boulevard. The expansion is part of a reorganization and upgrade of existing Campus Hollywood properties that accommodate the Musicians Institute, Theatre of Arts, International Dance Academy, and Elegance International.

Setting This vast ecoregion is located in the heart of Siberia, stretching over 20¬∞ of latitude and 50¬∞ of longitude (52¬∞ to 72¬∞ N, and 80¬∞ to 130¬∞ E). The climate in the East Siberian taiga is subarctic (tropical deciduous and coniferous) and displays high continentality, with extremes ranging from to . Winters are long and very cold, but dry, with little snowfall due to the effects of the Siberian anticyclone. Summers are short, but can be quite warm for the northerly location. Precipitation is low, ranging from , decreasing from east to west. The topography of this ecoregion is varied, consisting of wide, flat plains and areas of karst topography. In contrast to the neighbouring West Siberian taiga, large bogs and wetlands are conspicuously absent. Some trees also shed their leaves annually, a characteristic of deciduous forests. Flora Vegetation consists mainly of vast, dense forests of Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii), with Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) and hybrids between the Dahurian and Siberian larches (Larix x czekanowskii) occurring as one moves to the west. Cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) bushes dominate the understory. Throughout the ecoregion, smaller areas dominated by Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) and Siberian fir (Abies sibirica) can be found. Pine forests and deciduous forests composed of birch and poplar species become more common as one moves south, and at the headwaters of the Lena River and the Nizhnyaya Tunguska River, as well as in the Angara River basin, steppe and shrub-steppe communities can be found along with areas of forest-steppe. Fauna This region contains the highest number of brown bears (Ursus arctos collaris), Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus), moose (Alces alces) and wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Russia. Further south mammals in the East Siberian taiga include Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus), Altai wapiti also known as Asian elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Birds of this ecoregion include the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia), Siberian grouse (Falcipennis falcipennis), black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), black-billed capercaillie (Tetrao parvirostris), willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), black stork (Ciconia nigra), hooded crane (Grus monacha), carrion crow (Corvus corone), the Siberian blue and rufous-tailed robins (Luscinia cyane and L. sibilans, respectively), the thrush nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), Pallas's rosefinch (Carpodacus roseus), Pacific swift (Apus pacificus), common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), smew (Mergellus albellus), king eider (Somateria spectabilis), spectacled eider (Somateria fischeri) and Baikal teal (Anas formosa). Conservation status, threats and protected areas Although little of this ecoregion is protected, its conservation status is listed as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". Protected areas in this ecoregion include: * Stolby Nature Sanctuary * Olyokma Nature Reserve * Tunguska Nature Reserve * Central Siberia Nature Reserve All are \\"Zapovedniks\\", (that is, strict ecological reserves). The main threats to this ecoregion's integrity are poaching and clear-cut logging in the southern and central portions of the region. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, came a new threat. There is little forest in China, and Chinese entrepreneurs (due to the lack of woods, and fuelled by strong economic growth), began to show interest in obtaining the woods from RF. High levels of corruption and some other reasons allowed them to achieve their goal. A new law adopted was Federal law 473-FZ, which protects the rights of foreign companies in RF, and Chinese lumberjacks began to destroy all the trees on the leased land (and far beyond too). There have been numerous attempts of deforestation in the protected floodplain of the rivers. Because of the large environmental damage, their activities caused protests by local residents and the World Wide Fund for Nature. The actions of the Chinese companies pose a threat to the native population of Siberia and the Far East (Evenks, Udege et al.), depriving them of their habitat and traditional ways of life. Total deforestation by Chinese companies creates an additional threat to rare and endangered species such as the Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, East Siberian brown bear et al..

It came into prominence in the early 1990s, especially with the popularity of the Fox series Beverly Hills, 90210. After 90210 became a success, television writers and producers realized the potential for this new genre to reach out to a previously ignored demographic. In the past, most series that maintained a focus on teenagers had been sitcoms, while adolescents in drama series were usually part of a larger ensemble that included adults and children. More often than not, teen dramas have soap opera elements, incorporating one or more ongoing story arcs spanning several episodes. The young characters must deal with the dramatic ups and downs of their friendships and romances while facing an array of issues thought to be typical of adolescence. There have also been many successful teen-based series with major science fiction, fantasy and action/adventure themes. Varieties The most popular teen dramas are set in affluent locales (such as Beverly Hills, 90210, set in the Beverly Hills suburb of Los Angeles; The O.C., which was set in Newport Beach, California; and Gossip Girl, which was set in the Upper East Side of New York City), or in fictional small town settings (such as One Tree Hill, which was set in the North Carolina town of Tree Hill; Dawson's Creek, which was set in Capeside, Massachusetts; and Gilmore Girls, which was set in Stars Hollow, Connecticut). Shows that depict teenage life in a more realistic manner tend not to do as well ‚Äì such examples include My So- Called Life and Freaks and Geeks, which were critically acclaimed, but suffered from low ratings and were subsequently cancelled. Recent outliers to this trend of unsuccessful realistic teen dramas is Euphoria and Never Have I Ever with both having already amassed much success and to a lesser extent On My Block. Though the genre originated in the United States, teen dramas have also become popular in other countries such as Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. Some teen dramas can also be sub-categorized into genres such as science fiction (such as Roswell, Kyle XY and The 100), action/adventure (such as Smallville), fantasy (such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Vampire Diaries, Teen Wolf and Shadowhunters), and mystery (such as Veronica Mars, Pretty Little Liars, 13 Reasons Why, and Riverdale). History The first teen-oriented shows did not call themselves teen dramas. One of the earliest was the single-season soap opera Never Too Young, which aired from 1965 to 1966. As the late 1960s and early 1970s progressed, younger viewers began to find relatable characters on more daytime soaps. In 1967, Love is a Many Splendored Thing premiered and quickly became a hit with teenage audiences. It was soon followed by All My Children in 1970 and The Young and the Restless in 1973. In primetime, various shows that centered on the entire family focused much of the attention on the adolescent characters. Such examples include Eight Is Enough, Family, Little House on the Prairie, The Waltons, and the short-lived James at 15. As a result, young stars like Willie Aames, Kristy McNichol and Melissa Gilbert became youth icons. The longest running teen drama is the British programme Grange Hill, a show that ran from the late 1970s to the late 2000s, which featured teenagers in the high school context. It was popular in Britain and to a lesser extent, Australia, and featured many situations that high school teens would face, though perhaps less stylised or upbeat than some U.S. shows. One of the first shows to be centered solely on teenagers, Degrassi Junior High (and later its spin-off Degrassi High), became popular in both its native Canada as well as in the United States when it aired in that country on PBS during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1990, Darren Star created Beverly Hills, 90210, in partnership with prolific television producer Aaron Spelling. The popularity of teen dramas in the 1990s and 2000s is most often attributed to the massive success of this primetime soap, which portrayed the lives of a group of wealthy teens living in Beverly Hills, California. The stars of 90210, most notably Jason Priestley and Luke Perry, became teen idols. The series became a pop culture phenomenon and drew a large audience; 90210 remained popular through the first half of the 1990s, and remained on the air until 2000, becoming the third longest running teen drama in history (after Grange Hill and Degrassi, which surpassed 90210 for second place with its 11th season in 2011). Another teen drama of the early 1990s was the 1994‚Äì95 ABC series My So- Called Life, which launched the careers of young actors Claire Danes and Jared Leto. Although the series was critically acclaimed for its realistic portrayal of teen life, it was not a ratings success, mainly because it shared a timeslot with the NBC sitcom Friends (which debuted that same season and became an almost immediate hit), and was canceled after its first season. Another series that was met with positive reviews but cancelled prematurely was the 1999-2000 NBC series Freaks and Geeks. Since their cancellations, both shows have gained a large cult following. The creation of the teen-targeting The WB network in January 1995 helped launch a new era for teen-oriented television programs. Within three years, Dawson's Creek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, Smallville and One Tree Hill acquired large teenage fan bases. Another network that debuted the same month as The WB, UPN, also gradually began featuring programs targeted at teens and created a few notable teen-oriented series, though most of these programs were comedies. One of UPN's most notable series was Veronica Mars. The CW, which replaced The WB and UPN in September 2006, has incorporated shows targeted towards teenagers and young adults, such as Gossip Girl, 90210, The Vampire Diaries, and Riverdale. Subscription-based media providers such as Netflix and HBO have gained success and controversy due contents of their more mature teen dramas 13 Reasons Why and Euphoria, respectively.

It was agreed to by Rajiv Gandhi; two years later, India and Maldives signed a memorandum of understanding in October 1988. The foundation was laid on 14 January 1990 and it took almost 5 years to complete the hospital.

It is one of several oxides of rare earth elements with a high melting point. It is used in the preparation of other scandium compounds as well as in high- temperature systems (for its resistance to heat and thermal shock), electronic ceramics, and glass composition (as a helper material). Structure and physical properties Scandium(III) oxide adopts a cubic crystal structure (point group: tetrahedral (Th), space group: Ia) containing 6-coordinate metal centres.Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 5th edition Oxford Science Publications Powder diffraction analysis shows Sc‚àíO bond distances of 2.159-2.071 √Ö. Scandium oxide is an insulator with a band gap of 6.0 eV. Production Scandium oxide is the primary form of refined scandium produced by the mining industry. Scandium-rich ores, such as thortveitite (Sc,Y)2(Si2O7) and kolbeckite ScPO4¬∑2H2O are rare, however trace amounts of scandium are present in many other minerals. Scandium oxide is therefore predominantly produced as a by-product from the extraction of other elements. Reactions Scandium oxide is the primary form of refined scandium produced by the mining industry, making it the start point for all scandium chemistry. Scandium oxide reacts with most acids upon heating, to produce the expected hydrated product. For example, heating in excess aqueous HCl produces hydrated ScCl3¬∑nH2O. This can be rendered anhydrous by evaporation to dryness in the presence of NH4Cl, with the mixture then being purified by removal of NH4Cl by sublimation at 300-500 ¬∞C. The presence of NH4Cl is required, as the hydrated ScCl3¬∑nH2O would otherwise form a mixed oxychloride upon drying. :Sc2O3 \\\\+ 6 HCl + x H2O ‚Üí 2 ScCl3¬∑nH2O + 3 H2O :ScCl3¬∑nH2O + n NH4Cl ‚Üí ScCl3 \\\\+ n H2O + n NH4Cl Likewise, it is converted into hydrated scandium(III) triflate (Sc(OTf)3¬∑nH2O) by a reaction with triflic acid.McCleverty, J.A. and Meyer, T.J., Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II, 2003, Elsevier Science, , Vol. 3, p. 99 [\\"Refluxing scandium oxide with triflic acid leads to the isolation of hydrated scandium triflate\\"] Metallic scandium is produced industrially by the reduction of scandium oxide; this proceeds via conversion to scandium fluoride followed by a reduction with metallic calcium. This process is in some ways similar to the Kroll process for the production of metallic titanium. Scandium oxide forms scandate salts with alkalis, unlike its higher homologues yttrium oxide and lanthanum oxide (but like lutetium oxide), for example forming K3Sc(OH)6 with KOH. In this, scandium oxide shows more similarity with aluminium oxide.

It was the second high school built in Lawton, Oklahoma in the early 1960s. It is situated on a campus which contains Eisenhower Elementary, Eisenhower Middle School, 400 meter field and track zone, football and soccer fields, tennis courts, large parking areas, and other open areas. History Eisenhower High School is named after Dwight David \\"Ike\\" Eisenhower, who was the 34th President of the United States and supreme military commander of Allied forces in the European Theater during World War II. Eisenhower High School opened in September 1962 housing 700 students in a building containing 48 rooms. In May 1964, an auditorium was completed; and in 1965, the northwest wing was completed, providing the school with an additional 45 rooms and housing a total of 1,900 students. In the 2003-2004 school year, EHS had 1,380 students and 112 faculty. Its library contains approximately 16,000 volumes, not including textbooks. In 2006, construction began on a new wing that housed thirty classrooms, and in 2007, the courtyard was closed and a new cafeteria was built. The staff as of today locks all doors to the courtyard unless lunch is in session. As of the 2007-2008 school year, Eisenhower (commonly referred to by both its own students and the students of rival schools as IKE) has a student body of approximately 1400 students, a number that has increased greatly from the usual average of 1,100 due to freshmen being incorporated into the student body. Academics Eisenhower is also well known for academics. Eisenhower has represented the state of Oklahoma for ten years in the Academic Decathlon Nationals competition, having won the state competition for an entire decade. Students at Eisenhower go on to attend many of the most famous universities in the country, while many stay local to attend Cameron University in Lawton. Ike students also attend the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford, Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant or join the military, or the Lawton Public Schools itself. Athletics Eisenhower High School is well known for its excellence in sports. Most notably, the Eagles were 5A State and National Champions in football in 1990 as well as several other teams over the last 25 years. Many IKE athletes move on to play with many Big 12 Conference teams, such as Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, University of Texas, and other smaller nationwide colleges and within the state of Oklahoma. In 2007, Eisenhower Eagles men's basketball team were 6A State Finalist with a record of 24-3 under Head Coach Bruce Harrington and Assistant Coaches Brad Cooksey and Michael Parks. Additionally within 2007, the Eisenhower Eagles Varsity men's bowling team progressed all the way to the state finals, where they won and were crowned the 2007 Oklahoma High School Varsity Boys Bowling Team. Additionally, the men‚Äôs bowling team also were crowned state champions in 2016. The Women‚Äôs bowling team has been on a dynasty run winning the state title the past 6 years.Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association Cheerleading has also been a major sport with their recent win of 6th in the 5A state competition in Tulsa, Oklahoma under Allison Wyatt and Cheryl Zimmerman.

United States of America v. Michael Marcavage Michael Marcavage of Repent America A three-judge panel with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit unanimously overturned the federal convictions of Marcavage, director of RA, for preaching on the public sidewalk near the Liberty Bell, stemming from an arrest in 2007, citing that \\"the government impermissibly infringed Marcavage's First Amendment right to free speech.\\" Judges Michael Fisher, Thomas Hardiman and Robert Cowen issued a 52-page decision in Marcavage's favor, striking down both of the prosecution's criminal claims against Marcavage, while upholding his constitutionally protected right to preach and speak on the public sidewalks surrounding Independence National Historical Park. Philadelphia 11 On October 10, 2004, eleven members of RA were arrested and charged under Pennsylvania's hate crimes law while preaching at OutFest, a gay pride event in Philadelphia. The charges against the members of the group could have resulted in up to 47 years in prison each. All the charges were later dismissed by Common Pleas Court Judge Pamela Dembe as being without merit. On November 15, 2007, following a legal action brought by RA, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court in a 4-to-1 decision struck down amendments to the state's \\"hate crimes\\" law, formally known as the Ethnic Intimidation Act, under which the members had been charged in 2004. The published opinion, Marcavage, et al. v. Rendell, et al. , declared that the amendments enacted in 2002, protecting people based upon \\"actual or perceived . . . ancestry, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity,\\" were \\"unconstitutional and therefore null and void\\" due to the process in which the law was passed.

Retrieved 15 March 2007 Deriving from ancient Chinese myths and folklores, a fox that lives a thousand years turns into a kumiho, like its Japanese and Chinese counterparts.Heinz Insu Fenkl, \\"A Fox Woman Tale of Korea \\" It can freely transform, among other things, into a beautiful woman often set out to seduce boys, and eat their liver or heart (depending on the legend). There are numerous tales in which the kumiho appears, several of which can be found in the encyclopedic Compendium of Korean Oral Literature (ÌïúÍµ≠ Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏Ìïô ÎåÄÍ≥Ñ/ÈüìÂúãÂè£Á¢ëÊñáÂ≠∏Â§ßÁ≥ª). Mythology A 3rd-century nine-tailed fox illustration from the Shan Hai Jing, a classic Chinese text (Qing Dynasty) Originating in Chinese myths dating back centuries before being introduced to Korean mythology, the Korean kumiho shares many similarities to the Chinese huli jing and the Japanese kitsune. Classic of Mountains and Seas, an old Chinese text, claims a fox with nine tails lives in an area called Qingqiu (Èùë‰∏ò). As the kumiho and other versions of the nine-tailed fox myths and folklores originated from China, they all have a similar concept. All explain fox spirits as being the result of great longevity or the accumulation of energy, said to be foxes who have lived for a thousand years, and give them the power of shapeshifting, usually appearing in the guise of a woman. However, while huli jing and kitsune are often depicted with ambiguous moral compasses, possibly good or bad, the kumiho is almost always treated as a malignant figure who feasts on human flesh. It is unclear at which point in time Koreans began viewing the kumiho as a purely evil creature, since many ancient texts of the Chinese mention the benevolent kumiho assisting humans (and even make mentions of wicked humans tricking kind but na√Øve kumiho). In later literature, kumiho were often depicted as bloodthirsty half-fox, half-human creatures that wandered cemeteries at night, digging human hearts out from graves. The fairy tale The Fox Sister depicts a fox spirit preying on a family for their livers. However, according to Gyuwon Sahwa, kumiho is described as an auspicious fox spirit with a book in its mouth. Considering the text is thought to be written in 1675, some speculate that the modern violent image of kumiho is influenced during the Japanese occupation in Korea. Nevertheless, foxes often contained a negative image during the Koryo Dynasty (Shin Don was described as an old fox spirit due to his love for women and drinks despite his being a buddhist monk), suggesting two different views could have co-existed in ancient Korea. Taiping Guangji claims Silla worshipped foxes as sacred beings. The most distinctive feature that separates the kumiho from its two counterparts (Japanese kitsune, and Chinese huli jing) is the existence of a 'yeowoo guseul' (Ïó¨Ïö∞Íµ¨Ïä¨, literally meaning fox marble/bead) which is said to consist of knowledge. According to Korean mythology, the yeowoo guseul provides power to the kumiho and knowledge (and intelligence) to people if they can steal and swallow one. The kumiho can absorb humans' energy with it. The method of absorbing energy with the \\"yeowoo guseul\\" resembles a \\"deep kiss\\" (i.e. a kiss using a tongue). The kumiho sends the yeowoo guseul into people's mouths and then retakes it with their tongues. If that person swallows the yeowoo guseul, however, and then observes \\"sky, land, and people\\", each observation gives the observer preternatural knowledge. But the person fails to watch the \\"sky\\" in most tales, so they get a special ability but not the most important one. Most legends state that while a gumiho was capable of changing its appearance, there is still something persistently foxy about it (i.e. a foxy face, a set of ears, or the tell-tale nine tails) or a magical way of forcing; its countenance changes, but its nature does not. In Transformation of the Kumiho (Íµ¨ÎØ∏Ìò∏Ïùò Î≥ÄÏã†), a kumiho transforms into the identical likeness of a bride at a wedding and is only discovered when her clothes are removed. Bakh Mun-su and the Kumiho (Î∞ïÎ¨∏ÏàòÏôÄ Íµ¨ÎØ∏Ìò∏) records an encounter that Pak Munsu has with a girl, living alone in the woods, that has a foxy appearance. In The Maiden who Discovered a Kumiho through a Chinese Poem (ÌïúÏãúÎ°ú Íµ¨ÎØ∏Ìò∏Î•º ÏïåÏïÑÎÇ∏ Ï≤òÎÖÄ), the kumiho is ultimately revealed when a hunting dog catches the scent of a fox and attacks. Although they have the ability to change forms, the true identity of a kumiho was said to be zealously guarded by the kumiho themselves. Some tales say that if a kumiho abstains from killing and eating humans for a thousand days, it can become human. Much like changelings, werewolves or vampires in Western lore, there are always variations on the myth depending on the liberties that each story takes with the legend. One version of the mythology, however, holds that with enough will, a kumiho could further ascend from its yogoe (yokai) state, become permanently human and lose its evil character. Explanations of how this could be achieved vary, but sometimes include aspects such as refraining from killing or tasting meat for a thousand days, or obtaining a cintamani and making sure that the Yeoiju saw the full moon at least every month during the ordeal. Unlike Yeoiju-wielding dragons, kumiho were not thought to be capable of omnipotence or creation at will, since they were lesser creatures.

The company expanded to the United States in 1980, opening a store in Santa Fe Springs, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. The firm concentrated initially on warm- weather US states such as California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, Texas, Georgia and Florida. Later they ventured into more seasonal markets such as North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC. After ten years as a listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange, Barbeques Galore delisted in 1996, and soon after listed on the US NASDAQ. In late 2005, the firm was delisted from the NASDAQ after a leveraged buy-out by Australian venture capital firm, Ironbridge Capital.Andr√© Sammartino (2007), 'Retail‚Äô, in Dick, H. & Merrett, D.

It became the band's breakthrough, achieving widespread commercial success after the band's first two studio albums had faced a more muted response. With the \\"tremendous\\" acclaim of Fire and Water at their backs, in the words of AllMusic, Free headlined the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival and \\"appeared destined for superstardom\\". Specifically, Fire and Water reached No. 2 on the U.K. album chart, being listed on it for a total of eighteen weeks. In contrast, neither of the band's prior two studio albums had charted at all. Fire and Water additionally reached No. 17 on the equivalent U.S. chart. The album spawned the popular single \\"All Right Now\\", praised by publications such as AllMusic as a hard rock \\"smash powered by [Paul] Rodgers' gritty, visceral vocals\\". The song became a Top 5 rock hit in not just the group's native United Kingdom, but it additionally did well in multiple European countries such as Austria, France, and Germany. Background and production The members of Free speak with fellow musician Steve Winwood in Amsterdam in July 1970. The individuals (from left to right) are Winwood, Andy Fraser, Paul Rodgers, Simon Kirke, & Paul Kossoff. The group had formed in London, England back in 1968, with musician Paul Kossoff of the blues band Black Cat Bones witnessing a project that featured frontman Paul Rodgers. Free came into being once the duo joined up with musicians Simon Kirke and Andy Fraser, the latter formerly from the ranks of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Free's debut album, titled Tons of Sobs, came out in 1968 to a muted response. The group's eponymous 1969 follow-up, while expanding on the band's mix of styles, also failed to achieve commercial success. Neither studio album had charted at all. Free recorded Fire and Water from January 1970 to June 1970 in London, the group using the engineering facilities of Island Studios and Trident Studios. Mike Sida devised the album's cover image, with Richard Polak being the band's photographer. Free produced the work themselves, with assistance from others. In addition, Roy Baker contributed to the album's production, providing particular help with the audio engineering. Before getting started with Free, he'd worked with groups such as Savoy Brown and The Deviants in the 1960s. After his association with Fire and Water, he has spent multiple decades serving rock bands such as Byzantium, Hawkwind, Queen, and The Cars. Reception Music critic Matthew Greenwald has written for AllMusic praising the album. He stated that by 1970 \\"Free presented itself to the world as a complete band, in every sense of the word\\", particularly with elements ranging from \\"Paul Kossoff's exquisite and tasteful guitar work to Paul Rodgers' soulful vocals\\" on display for listeners.

He is best known for his role as \\"Det. Ben Kokua\\" on the CBS television series Hawaii Five-O and as Mamo Kahike on the 2010 reboot of Hawaii Five-0 playing the owner of a surf shop and a bus driver in the off season. He had previously appeared in five episodes of the series as other characters. Early years Al Harrington was raised by his maternal grandmother in the village of Mapusaga in Pago Pago until he was three. His mother, Lela Suapaia, sent for him to join her while she was working as a nurse in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. She later married Roy Milburn Harrington a native of Iron Mountain, Michigan, who had come to Honolulu as a serviceman with the US Army. The elder Harrington later became a member of the Honolulu Police Department. However, it was not until Al Harrington's sophomore year in high school that he took his stepfather's last name. He excelled at theater and American football at Punahou School, where he was a member of the class of 1954. He participated in several productions at the school while at the same time wowed people on the football field. He led his team to the league championships at Honolulu Stadium and was the first high school football All-American to come out of Hawaii. Before transferring to Stanford University, Al attended Menlo College, a private business school location in Atherton, CA, from 1954-1955, where he was close friends with the soon to be Kingston Trio's Nick Reynolds ‚Äò56 and Bob Shane ‚Äò56. Al Harrington then went on to play for Stanford University, where he aspired to become a drama major. Unfortunately, there was some opposition to minority drama majors there. When he graduated in 1958 with a B.A. in History, the Baltimore Colts were interested in him. However, it did not offer the kind of money American professional football teams now offer, so he returned to Honolulu. Also, in order to pay for his tuition, he would work as a Polynesian dancer. It was this interesting occupation that led to an appearance on the classic game show To Tell the Truth. On his return to Hawaii, Harrington would eventually work as a history teacher at Punahou and professor at the University of Hawaii. He also performed for many years as an entertainer in Waikiki, earning the well-known moniker of \\"The South Pacific Man.\\" His popularity in the 1970s and 1980s made him a household name in Hawaii. He had a long running dance revue show, including Tahitian fire dancing, at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki. And, along with other entertainers such as Don Ho, he helped define the entertainment industry in Hawaii, known to tourists and dignitaries alike from around the world. Harrington is among a few of the supporting cast of Hawaii Five-O still alive along with William Smith, Sharon Farrell, Doug Mossman, and Dennis Chun (also the son of Kam Fong, he had spot cameos). Harrington and Chun have recurring roles as Mamo Kahike and Sgt. Duke Lukela respectively in the 2010 reboot. Religion and family Harrington is a Latter-day Saint. He had one of the lead parts in The Testaments, a film produced by the LDS Church.Church News, April 6, 2002 He also played the role of Thomas Trueblood in Light of the World, A Celebration of Life, that was put on by the LDS Church in Salt Lake City during the Olympics there in 2002.Church News, September 22, 2001 Al's sons Alema and Tau Harrington both attended Punahou School and later played football at Brigham Young University.

He was previously the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL) He has also served as the head football coach of the University of Washington from 2009 to 2013 and at the University of Southern California (USC) from 2014 to 2015. He played college football as a quarterback at Brigham Young University (BYU) and professionally with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Playing career =USC and El Camino College= After a standout baseball and football career at West High School in Torrance, California, Sarkisian's size (6', 165 lb) did not attract any college football offers. He began his collegiate athletic career in 1992 at USC as a non-scholarship middle infielder on the Trojans baseball team. He struggled playing NCAA Division I baseball and transferred after a semester to El Camino College, a two-year community college adjacent to his hometown of Torrance, where he played shortstop. At the urging of El Camino head football coach John Featherstone, one of his instructors, Sarkisian restarted his football career.Sports Illustrated ‚Äì The Sky's the Limit ‚Äì October 7, 1996 ‚Äì accessed September 28, 2011 As a redshirt freshman in 1993, Sarkisian earned All-Mission Conference honors. In his sophomore season, he was named a junior college All-American after setting a national junior college record by completing 72.4 percent of his passes. 1995 As a junior, Sarkisian transferred to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, for the 1995 season.Bob Condotta, New UW football coach Steve Sarkisian makes a quick rise in profession, The Seattle Times, December 14, 2008, Accessed January 26, 2009. He was recruited by DeWayne Walker, then an assistant coach for the BYU Cougars. Although Kansas State and Washington State showed interest, Sarkisian chose BYU primarily because the school boasted more combined Davey O'Brien- and Heisman-winning quarterbacks in the last decade than any other had in the previous 50 years of Division I-A. The previous starting quarterback, John Walsh, was also from Torrance and a friend of Sarkisian. Walsh left school a year early to enter the 1995 NFL Draft, creating a void in the depth chart; Sarkisian accepted a scholarship with BYU in December 1994. At BYU, Sarkisian was coached by offensive coordinator Norm Chow under head coach LaVell Edwards. As a junior, Sarkisian passed for 3,437 yards and 20 touchdowns, earning All-Western Athletic Conference honors. Sarkisian finished the season by completing 31 of 34 passes for 399 yards and three touchdowns in BYU's 45‚Äì28 victory over Fresno State. His completion percentage in the game (91.2 percent) set an NCAA record at that time. 1996 As a senior, Sarkisian opened BYU's 1996 season by passing for 536 yards and six touchdowns in the Cougars' 41‚Äì37 upset victory over Texas A&M; in the Pigskin Classic. The 536 yards passing were the most ever by a player against Texas A&M.; Sarkisian finished the game with a 46-yard touchdown pass to K. O. Kealaluhi to seal the victory. BYU finished the regular season with a 13‚Äì1 record, defeating Wyoming, 28‚Äì25, in the WAC Championship Game. Sarkisian passed for 4,027 yards and 33 touchdowns during the regular season. His 173.6 passer rating led the entire NCAA. For his efforts, he was named WAC Offensive Player of the Year and a second-team All- American. Sarkisian was also awarded the Sammy Baugh Trophy as the nation's top passer, making him the seventh BYU quarterback to win the honor. He was also featured on the cover of TV Guide in December 1996. BYU finished the season with 19‚Äì15 win over Kansas State in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Sarkisian threw a pair of touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to lead the Cougars to a come-from-behind victory. BYU finished the season with a 14‚Äì1 record and ranked fifth in the nation in both the AP Poll and Coaches' Poll. The Cougars became the first Division I-A team in NCAA history to win 14 games in a single season. Sarkisian's 162.0 career passing efficiency rating is 18th on the all- time NCAA list. Sarkisian earned his bachelor's degree in sociology from BYU in 1997 after receiving his associate's degree in general studies from El Camino in 1994. =Canadian Football League= Sarkisian played professionally for three seasons, 1997 to 1999, for the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was a starter in the 1999 season, finishing with 16 touchdown passes and 21 interceptions. His team finished with a dismal 3‚Äì15 record, prompting Sarkisian to end his playing career. Coaching career Sarkisian making USC's traditional \\"V-for-victory\\" sign after a 2008 fall practice =El Camino College= Sarkisian's coaching career began in 2000 when he returned to El Camino College as its quarterbacks coach. =USC and Oakland Raiders= The following season, Sarkisian joined his former coach, Norm Chow, at USC. Chow was hired as USC's offensive coordinator by new head coach Pete Carroll. Sarkisian worked as an offensive assistant in 2001 and then as quarterbacks coach in 2002 and 2003. In 2004, Sarkisian moved to the professional ranks as quarterbacks coach for the Oakland Raiders of the NFL. Oakland compiled more than 4,000 passing yards, ranking eighth out of 32 NFL teams in passing yardage. Sarkisian returned to USC for the 2005 season with the title of assistant head coach added to his duties as quarterbacks coach. In January 2007, Sarkisian interviewed with the Raiders for their vacant head coaching position, but pulled himself out of the running to stay at USC. Sarkisian was named to replace Lane Kiffin as USC's offensive coordinator when Kiffin took the head coaching job with the Raiders. =Washington= Sarkisian leading the Huskies onto the field The University of Washington introduced Sarkisian as its 23rd head football coach during a press conference in the Don James Center at Husky Stadium on December 8, 2008. Sarkisian signed a contract that paid him $1.75 million in 2009, with a salary increasing to $2.3 million by 2013.Seattle Post-Intelligencer ‚Äì Rowdy reception for 'Sark' ‚Äì December 8, 2008 Down in Los Angeles, John Morton succeeded Sarkisian as offensive coordinator at USC. In Sarkisian's first year as head coach in 2009, Washington scored a huge upset of Sarkisian's former team, defeating #3 USC 16‚Äì13 with a last second field goal. Washington then lost six of their next seven games, but finished the season in strong fashion, dominating rival Washington State, 30‚Äì0, to claim the Apple Cup, and scoring another upset with a rout of #19 California, 42‚Äì10. Washington finished the year with a 5‚Äì7 record, a dramatic improvement over the previous season, a winless 0‚Äì12. With Pete Carroll's departure from USC to coach the Seattle Seahawks on January 9, 2010, Sarkisian was discussed in the media as a potential replacement, but Sarkisian stated that he had not received an offer to become head coach of the Trojans. Despite his public comments, Sarkisian was still considered a top candidate for the position by USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett. However, Sarkisian expressed reservations about leaving Washington after one year, and decided not to pursue the position. Ultimately, Lane Kiffin was hired for the position. In Sarkisian's second season as head coach of Washington, the Huskies went 6‚Äì6 in 2010. The Huskies defeated USC again with a game-ending field goal, this time in Los Angeles. At mid-season, UW had alternated losses and wins and was 3‚Äì3, then were outscored 138‚Äì30 in the next three games, all losses against Arizona, Stanford, and Oregon. They fell to 3‚Äì6, but finished the year on a high note with three consecutive wins and were bowl eligible for the first time since the 2002 season. The Huskies concluded the season with a stunning 19‚Äì7 victory over #18 Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl, avenging a 56‚Äì21 blowout home loss to the Huskers in September. It was their first winning season in nine years. With star quarterback Jake Locker departing to the NFL, many expected the Huskies to regress in the 2011 season, Sarkisian's third. The Huskies started out a surprising 6‚Äì2 and were undefeated in conference play at the halfway point of the season; at one point, they were ranked in all major polls for the first time during his short tenure. But they then went 1‚Äì3 in their remaining conference games, with blowout defeats to Oregon, USC, and Oregon State. The Huskies subsequently lost in the Alamo Bowl to Baylor, 67‚Äì56, to finish 7‚Äì6 on the season. In 2012, the Washington Huskies finished 7-6 yet again following a 26‚Äì28 loss to Boise St in the Maaco Bowl Las Vegas. As his previous campaigns had gone, Sarkisian's 2012 Washington team defeated most of the lower-level Pac-12 teams but were blown out by the upper-level ones. Sarkisian's consecutive seven-win seasons earned him the mocking nickname \\"Seven Win Steve\\". Sarkisian would go on to win eight games in 2013 before taking the head coaching job at USC prior to Washington's bowl game. New contract Sarkisian's original contract in 2009 was for five years and paid $1.75 million in guaranteed money for the first year, rising to $2.0 million in 2011 and $2.3 million in 2013. Following the 2010 season and bowl victory, he signed a new five-year contract that paid $2.25 million in guaranteed money in 2011, rising to $2.85 million in 2015. =Return to USC= On December 2, 2013, Sarkisian chose to return to USC, accepting the head coaching position. Sarkisian's goal was to get USC back to its winning ways with NCAA sanctions finally ending. Like Lane Kiffin, Sarkisian called all plays on offense and served as the de facto offensive coordinator. Sarkisian dealt with some controversy before his first game as head coach, when defensive captain Josh Shaw told the team he suffered two high ankle sprains when he jumped from a balcony to save his drowning cousin. After numerous calls questioning the authenticity of the story, Shaw admitted he lied to the athletic department. Sarkisian suspended Shaw indefinitely. On September 8, 2014, Sarkisian and USC athletic director Pat Haden were reprimanded by Pac-12 Conference commissioner Larry Scott for attempting \\"to influence the officiating, and ultimately the outcome of a contest\\" during the September 6 game with Stanford. Haden was fined $25,000.Gary Klein, USC's Pat Haden fined $25,000 for 'inappropriate' sideline conduct, Los Angeles Times, September 8, 2014 2015 leave of absence and termination On October 11, 2015, Haden announced Sarkisian would take an indefinite leave of absence. Haden contacted Sarkisian after he learned that Sarkisian had not shown up to a scheduled practice on October 11, 2015. During his conversation with Sarkisian, Haden said he became aware that Sarkisian was \\"not healthy\\" and asked Sarkisian to take an indefinite leave of absence. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton would serve as interim head coach in Sarkisian's absence. ESPN later reported that Sarkisian came to a pre-practice meeting, only to have his assistants tell him to go home when he appeared to be intoxicated. Scott Wolf, the USC beat writer for the Los Angeles Daily News, reported on Twitter that several players smelled alcohol on Sarkisian's breath. On October 12, 2015, Haden announced that Sarkisian had been fired and named Helton as interim head coach for the remainder of the season (though the \\"interim\\" tag was removed after the season). He subsequently revealed that he had tried to call Sarkisian to notify him personally, but by then Sarkisian was on his way to an out-of-state rehab facility and could not be reached. According to ESPN, Haden had placed Sarkisian on a zero-tolerance policy regarding alcohol use after Sarkisian claimed to have mixed alcohol with medication, despite the fact that he appeared simply to have drunk far too heavily before giving a drunken and profanity-laced speech at a booster club event (Sarkisian apologized after the incident before the 2015 season began). The apparent intoxication at practice would have been grounds for termination. However, multiple reports said that Sarkisian's assistants believed he was drunk during a game against Arizona State. Hours before Sarkisian's firing, the Los Angeles Times reported that Sarkisian had been involved in numerous alcohol-related incidents while at the University of Washington. Haden admitted that he hadn't done a public-records check on Sarkisian prior to hiring him. Sarkisian filed a $30 million wrongful termination lawsuit against USC, but later agreed to move it to private arbitration. He eventually lost the suit, but would not appeal, stating that he would respect the result and move on. =Alabama= In September 2016, Alabama hired Sarkisian as an analyst for their football team. Following Lane Kiffin's departure to become the head coach at Florida Atlantic, Sarkisian was promoted to the Alabama offensive coordinator position on January 2, 2017. He stepped into the role in the National Championship game against Clemson. The Tide would lose narrowly to the Tigers in his first and only game of the 2016 season as offensive coordinator. =Atlanta Falcons= On February 7, 2017, Sarkisian was hired as offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons, taking over for the recently departed Kyle Shanahan after the Falcons blew a 28‚Äì3 lead in the Super Bowl. The offense's scoring output, under his guidance, dropped from 33.8 points per game (leading the NFL in 2016) to 22.1 points per game in 2017. In 2018, the offense's scoring improved to 25.9 points per game. On December 31, 2018, he was fired as offensive coordinator. = Alabama (second stint) = In January 2019, Alabama re-hired Sarkisian as the offensive coordinator. Personal life Born in Torrance, California, Sarkisian is the youngest of seven children, the only one in the family born in California; the older six siblings were born in Massachusetts. Sarkisian is of Armenian and Irish ancestry. His father is an Armenian born and raised in Tehran, Iran before immigrating to the United States at the age of 18 to attend college. Sarkisian's mother is an Irish-American from Massachusetts. He attended Brigham Young University. Sarkisian is Catholic. In April 2015, it was reported that Steve Sarkisian and his wife filed for divorce. Sarkisian and his ex-wife have three children, two daughters and a son. Their names are Taylor, Ashley, and Brady.

Among his novels are Queen's Cross, The Burnished Blade, Gentle Infidel, The Spider King, and The Prisoner of Tordesillas. Bibliography * The Burnished Blade (1948). The flaming martyrdom of Joan of Arc opens this historical romance in France at the dawn of the Renaissance.

Under Hugh's tutelage, Pierre learns the closely guarded secrets of the armorer's trade. But he is destined not to use them... * Gentle Infidel (1950, 2009). Two lovely women, different as night and day, two conflicting faiths - one of the East, the other of the West - claimed the heart of young Michael da Montelupo. The son of Christian parents, handsome, stalwart Michael was impressed as a boy into the Turkish Emperor's elite Janissary corps, rigorously trained to become a brave, fanatical Moslem soldier. As a Turk, Michael fell under the sultry spell of Aeshia, a sensuous, scheming young Turkish wife, who tricked him into a relationship that nearly cost him his career - and his life. But Angelica, the slim, fair, Venetian girl, awakened in him echoes of his early Christian faith. It was for her that he put the East and its barbaric turbulence behind. Michael's romantic adventures are enacted against the background of an era of gaudy decadence, crafty intrigue, and exotic, colorful pageantry. The climax is reached in the spectacular siege and conquest of Constantinople in 1453, which marked Christendom's last stand against the infidel. * The Golden Exile (1951).

Plot introduction Maria, a young girl from a remote village of Brazil, whose first encounters with love had left her heartbroken, goes to seek her fortune in Switzerland. She works for a time in a nightclub but soon becomes dissatisfied and after a heated discussion with her manager one night, she quits her job. She tries to become a model but is unsuccessful. Because she is running out of money, she accepts 1000 francs from an Arab man to spend the night with him. She then decides to become a prostitute and ends up in a brothel on Rue de Berne, the heart of Geneva's red-light district. There she befriends Nyah who gives her advice on her \\"new profession\\" and after learning the tricks of the trade from Milan, the brothel owner, she enters the job with her body and mind shutting all doors for love and keeps her heart open only for her diary. Quickly she becomes quite successful and famous and her colleagues begin to envy her. Months pass and Maria grows into a professionally groomed prostitute who not only relaxes her clients' minds, but also calms their souls by talking to them about their problems. Her world turns upside down when she meets Ralf, a young Swiss painter, who sees her \\"inner light\\". Maria falls in love with him immediately and begins to experience what \\"true love\\" is (according to the author, it is a sense of being for someone without actually possessing him/her). Maria is now split between her sexual fantasies and true love for Ralf. Eventually she decides that it is time for her to leave Geneva with her memory of Ralf, because she realizes that they are worlds apart. But before leaving, she decides to rekindle the dead sexual fire in Ralf and learns from him about the nature of Sacred Sex, sex which is mingled with true love and which involves the giving up of one's soul for the loved one.

It was written by Douglas Niles and Michael Dobson and published by TSR, Inc., in 1985. While it contained some traditional D&D; elements, the main portion of the module was a series of mass battles using the D&D; Battlesystem. Plot summary Bloodstone Pass combines a role-playing scenario with Battlesystem combat. In the plot, the player characters are hired to organize the defense of the town of Bloodstone Pass against an army of orcs, goblins, giants. The army also included human renegades led by a powerful assassin. The module's action focuses on leading the armies rather than having the battle occur in the background while the players adventure to find a MacGuffin. Publication history Bloodstone Pass was originally the working name of what became the first edition of Battlesystem. However, it was felt that the name did not convey the feeling of the system. After the developers had settled on the name Battlesystem, they used the \\"Bloodstone Pass\\" name for the first Battlesystem game accessory. Bloodstone Pass was written by Douglas Niles and Michael Dobson and published by TSR, Inc., in 1985 as a boxed set. The set included a 32-page scenario booklet, a 24-page unit roster, a model-building instruction booklet, 12 cardstock building sheets for constructing a fold-together cardboard village and miniature figures, and 104 cardboard counters. Cover art was by Jeff Easley. Originally intended as a stand-alone module, it later became the first part of the four-part Bloodstone Pass Saga. The saga is known as the H series and includes Bloodstone Pass (H1), The Mines of Bloodstone (H2), The Bloodstone Wars (H3), and The Throne of Bloodstone (H4). When The Bloodstone Wars was published, the original generic setting of Bloodstone Pass was retconned into the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. Module FR9, The Bloodstone Lands, describes the area of the Forgotten Realms where the Bloodstone Pass Saga occurs. In this module's version of history the events of H series modules have run their course with the pregenerated PCs. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed Bloodstone Pass for Dragon magazine #135 (July 1988). He called it a \\"real nice package\\" but noted that, because it was designed for use with Battlesystem, \\"the buildings are not even close to 25mm scale\\". Rich Baker, one of the designers of the 2006 module Red Hand of Doom, compared that adventure to Bloodstone Pass, saying they provide similar challenges to players.

He was the son of Ragoba Dadu by his first wife. He was a Chitpavan Brahmin. Little or nothing is known of the boyhood of Dinkar Rao, except that his education in his mother tongue was commenced about his fifth year under the supervision of his father. He was also instructed in Sanskrit and Persian. Particular attention appears to have been bestowed on his religious education. He grew up an orthodox Hindu, pious and punctual in the performance of his religious duties. He loved Hindu music and acquired a fair knowledge of Hindu medicine.Representative Indians by Govinda Parameswaran Pillai At fifteen he entered the service of the Gwalior State, in which his ancestors had served. Rapidly promoted to the responsible charge of a division, he showed such signs of marked ability that his services were specially recognised by his appointment as the Subadar of Taranagar Division, in succession to his father. He displayed unusual talents in reorganizing the police and revenue departments, and in reducing chaos to order. In 1851 Dinkar Rao became Dewan. The events which led to the British victories of Maharajpur and Panniar in 1844 had filled the state with mutinous soldiery, ruined the finances and weakened authority. With a strong hand the dewan suppressed disorder, abolished ruinous imports, executed public works, and by reduction of salaries, including his own, turned a deficit into a surplus. During the period of the Indian rebellion of 1857 Rao never wavered in loyalty to the British; and although the state troops also mutinied in June 1858 on the approach of Tantia Topi, he adhered to the British cause, retiring with Maharaja Sindhia to the Agra fort. After the restoration of order he remained Minister until December 1859. In 1862, he was nominated by Lord Canning, along with Raja of Benaras and Maharaja of Patiala to his legislative council.Indian Polity, Laxmikanth In 1873 he was appointed guardian to the minor rana to Dholpur, but soon afterwards he resigned, owing to ill health. Service as Commissioner In 1875, the Viceroy of India, Lord Northbrook, selected him as a Commissioner, along with the Maharajas of Sindhia and Jaipur and three British colleagues, to try the Gaikwad of Baroda on a charge of attempting to poison Colonel Robert Phayre, the British Resident. Knighthood He was amongst the first non-British members of the Legislative Council of India appointed in 1861 vide the Indian Councils Act 1861 and an estate was conferred upon him. In May 1866, Dinkar Rao was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI), entitling him to be styled \\"Sir Dinkar Rao.\\" At the Imperial assemblage at Delhi that year, the title of \\"Raja\\" was bestowed on him. In 1884, Lord Dufferin made the title hereditary. Lord Dufferin, who took a peculiar interest in Gwalior, was particularly solicitous that Dinkar Rao should be held in due regard by the British Government and recommended him personally to the good offices of the British officials everywhere, and to those of the Native States in which his property lay.Representative Indians by Govinda Parameswaran Pillai He died on 9 January 1896. No Indian statesmen of the 19th century gained a higher reputation, yet he only commenced the study of English at the age of forty and was never able to converse fluently in it. His orthodoxy resented social reforms, and he kept aloof from the Indian National Congress.

Specifically, there was a delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, Louisiana. (See Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans for criticism of the failure of Federal flood protection.) Within days of Katrina's August 29, 2005 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the preparations for and response to the storm. Criticism was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained in New Orleans without water, food or shelter and the deaths of several citizens by thirst, exhaustion, and violence, days after the storm itself had passed. The treatment of people who had evacuated to registered facilities such as the Superdome was also criticized. Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits, and journalists of all stripes has been directed at the local, state and federal governments. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was also criticized for failing to implement his flood plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin is that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until less than a day before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.\\" Adding to the criticism was the broadcast of school bus parking lots full of baby blue school buses, which Mayor Nagin refused to be used in evacuation. When asked why the buses were not used to assist evacuations instead of holing up in the Superdome, Nagin cited the lack of insurance liability and shortage of bus drivers.Frontline: The Storm New Orleans has been classified as a non-regime city. Regimes involve governmental and non-governmental cooperation, a specific agenda, a recognized problem and resources to deal with the problem. New Orleans only had a temporary coalition to deal with Hurricane Katrina, which led to ineffective, temporary and inefficient evacuation and provision of resources. Organizations such as the Red Cross attempted to form coalitions, but the various actors could not agree on a specific solution, and this failure to cooperate led to instability and misunderstanding between governmental and non-governmental actors.Burns, P.; Thomas, M.. \\"The Failure of the Nonregime: How Katrina exposed New Orleans as a Regimeless City\\". Urban Affairs Review 41 (4): 517-527. Criticism of the evacuation process New Orleans was already one of the poorest metropolitan areas in the United States in 2005, with the eighth-lowest median income ($3). At 24.5 percent, Orleans Parish had the sixth-highest poverty rate among U.S. counties or county equivalents. The 2000 U.S. census revealed that 28% of New Orleans households, amounting to approximately 120,000 people, were without private mobility. Despite these factors preventing many people from being able to evacuate on their own, the mandatory evacuation called on August 27 made no provisions to evacuate homeless, low-income, or sick individuals, nor the city's elderly or infirm residents. Consequently, most of those stranded in the city were the poor, the elderly, and the sick. It has been stated in the evacuation order that, beginning at noon on August 28 and running for several hours, all city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents to, \\"refuges of last resort,\\" designated in advance, including the Louisiana Superdome.Davis, Matthew. \\"Fema 'knew of New Orleans danger'.\\" BBC News.

They also said that the state had prepositioned enough food and water to supply 15,000 citizens with supplies for three days, the anticipated waiting period before FEMA would arrive in force and provide supplies for those still in the city. Later, it was found that FEMA had provided these supplies, but that FEMA Director Michael D. Brown was greatly surprised by the much larger numbers of people who turned up seeking refuge and that the first wave of supplies were quickly depleted. The large number of deaths were a result of the insufficient response and evacuation before Katrina's arrival, primarily due to city and state resistance to issuing an evacuation order and risking \\"crying wolf\\" and losing face should the hurricane have left the path of model prediction. Had contra-flow on highways been initiated sooner and more buses begun evacuating families (including the idle school buses that were not used at all) the numbers of stranded New Orleans occupants would have been significantly less, making the initial wave of FEMA supplies adequate and even excessive.

On the morning of August 28, the president telephoned Mayor Nagin to \\"plead\\" for a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, and Nagin and Gov.

In January 2006, the President gave his 2006 State of the Union Address: In January 2007, the fired FEMA director Michael D. Brown charged that partisan politics had played a role in the White House's decision to federalize emergency response to the disaster in Louisiana only, rather than along the entire affected Gulf Coast region, which Brown said he had advocated. \\"Unbeknownst to me, certain people in the White House were thinking, 'We had to federalize Louisiana because she's a white, female Democratic governor, and we have a chance to rub her nose in it,'\\" Brown said, speaking before a group of graduate students at the Metropolitan College of New York on January 19, 2007. \\"'We can't do it to Haley [Mississippi governor Haley Barbour] because Haley's a white male Republican governor.

During that hearing, Representative Stephen Buyer (R-IN) inquired as to why President Bush's declaration of state of emergency of August 27 had not included the coastal parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and Plaquemines. (In fact, the declaration did not include any of Louisiana's coastal parishes; rather, they were included in the declaration dated August 29.) Brown testified that this was because Louisiana Governor Blanco had not included those parishes in her initial request for aid, a decision that he found \\"shocking.\\" After the hearing, Blanco released a copy of a letter dated August 28 which showed her requesting assistance for \\"all the southeastern parishes including the City of New Orleans\\" as well specifically naming 14 parishes including Jefferson, Orleans and Plaquemines. =Department of Homeland Security= Hurricane Katrina was arguably the first major test of the Department of Homeland Security after September 11.Thomas, Cal; Beckelis, Bob. \\"A big easy: Fix FEMA, embrace independent inquiry.\\" USA Today.

On September 4, 2005, Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security, held a press conference stating: Chertoff's remarks were heavily criticized, as the scenario of a levee breach had been previously envisioned by the Army Corps of Engineers and the storm had closely followed the National Weather Service predictions.

Shortly after being hired by FEMA, the State of Louisiana requested Kenyon to work directly for them to complete the work. In 2005, Kenyon International was still a subsidiary of Service Corporation International (SCI). Kenyon received the government contract due to the nature of the incident and their extensive knowledge and previous experience of working mass fatality events. The federal government has been highly criticized for the hiring of Kenyon for several reasons, including the availability of volunteer morticians from in and around New Orleans, the questionable usage of federal funding, the ineffectiveness of the organization in carrying out is duties leaving bodies to be found up to a year after Katrina made landfall, an extensively checkered past that the Bush Administration was aware of and accused of covering-up, and the length of time it took to identify victims once their bodies were recovered. ; Recommended charities FEMA was criticized for giving undue prominence to Operation Blessing International, placing it as #2 on their list of recommended charities right after the American Red Cross.Ross, Brian. \\"Some Question Robertson's Katrina Charity.\\" ABC News.

Notably, federal troops are generally prohibited from directly enforcing state laws (e.g., controlling looting or riots) by the Posse Comitatus Act, with some exceptions. The President can assume command of state troops under the Stafford Act, but in this \\"federalized\\", or \\"Title 10\\" status, the federalized National Guard troops become unable to enforce laws directly, just like other federal troops. However, the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to National Guard troops under the command of a state governor. Shortly before midnight on Friday, September 2, the Bush administration sent Governor Blanco a request to take over command of law enforcement under the Insurrection Act (one of the exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act), but this request was rejected by Blanco.Roig-Franzia, Manuel; Hsu, Spencer. \\"Many Evacuated, but Thousands Still Waiting.\\" The Washington Post.

Blanco also failed to activate a compact with other states that would have allowed her to bypass the National Guard Bureau in a request for additional troops. Within the United States and as delineated in the National Response Plan, response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels. One example of this is that the City of New Orleans attempted to manage the disaster from a hotel ballroom with inadequate back-up communications plans instead of a properly staffed Emergency Operations Center.World Psychiatry: The Katrina disaster and its lessons, Lynn E. DeLisi, World Psychiatry. 2006 February; 5(1): 3‚Äì4. When phone service failed, they had difficulty communicating their specific needs to the state EOC in Baton Rouge.

Konie's shoulder was fractured, and she was taken into police custody for failing to surrender her firearm.KTVU Channel 2 San Francisco video of the Patricia Konie incident Angered civilians, backed by the National Rifle Association and other organizations, filed protests over the constitutionality of such an order and the difficulty in tracking seizures, as paperwork was rarely filed during the searches. Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association, defended the right of affected civilians to retain firearms, saying that, \\"What we've seen in Louisiana - the breakdown of law and order in the aftermath of disaster - is exactly the kind of situation where the Second Amendment was intended to allow citizens to protect themselves.\\" The searches received little news coverage, though reaction from groups such as the NRA, the Second Amendment Foundation, and Gun Owners of America was immediate and heated, and a lawsuit was filed September 22 by the NRA and SAF on behalf of two firearm owners whose firearms were seized. On September 23, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana issued a restraining order to bar further firearms confiscations. After refusing to admit that it had any seized firearms, the city revealed in mid-March that it did have a cache of some 1000 firearms seized after the hurricane; this disclosure came after the NRA filed a motion in court to hold the city in contempt for failure to comply with the U.S. District Court's earlier order to return all seized firearms. On April 14, 2006, it was announced that the city will begin to return seized firearms, however as of late 2008, many firearms were still in police possession, and the matter was still in court. The matter was finally settled in favor of the NRA in October 2008. Per the agreement, the city was required to relax the strict proof of ownership requirements previously used, and was to release firearms to their owners with an affidavit claiming ownership and a background check to verify that the owner is legally able to possess a firearm. Louisiana legislator Steve Scalise introduced Louisiana House Bill 760, which would prohibit confiscation of firearms in a state of emergency, unless the seizure is pursuant to the investigation of a crime, or if the seizure is necessary to prevent immediate harm to the officer or another individual. On June 8, 2006, HB 760 was signed into law. 21 other states joined Louisiana in enacting similar laws. A federal law prohibiting seizure of lawfully held firearms during an emergency, the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006, passed in the House with a vote of 322 to 99, and in the Senate by 84-16.

Two-thirds of the residents of New Orleans are black, primarily attributed to decades of white flight. In addition, New Orleans is one of America's poorest cities, with more than 25% of residents and 40% of children living at or below the poverty line. Within the city itself, the poorest, who are mostly African-American, tended to live in the lowest parts that are most vulnerable to flooding. 98% of residents in the Lower Ninth Ward, which was flooded by a catastrophic breach in the nearby Industrial Canal, are black, and more than a third live in poverty. Many of the poor depend on welfare, Social Security, or other public assistance checks, which they receive on the first of each month, meaning that Hurricane Katrina made landfall just when many of the poor had exhausted their resources. Thus, many of the city's poor simply couldn't afford to flee the city before the hurricane struck. Speaking at a press conference from a relief center in Lafayette, First Lady Laura Bush explained that the poor are always the main victims of natural disasters. \\"This is what happens when there's a natural disaster of this scope,\\" Mrs. Bush said. \\"The poorer people are usually in the neighborhoods that are the lowest or the most exposed or the most vulnerable. Their housing is the most vulnerable to natural disaster. And that is just always what happens.\\" Reverend Jesse Jackson criticized the President and asked why he has not named African-Americans to top positions in the federal response to the disaster, particularly when the majority of victims remaining stranded in New Orleans were black: \\"How can blacks be locked out of the leadership, and trapped in the suffering? It is that lack of sensitivity and compassion that represents a kind of incompetence.\\" Fifty-one percent of Louisiana residents who were killed by Hurricane Katrina were black; 49% of victims were 75 years old or older. However, for some demographic groups in Orleans Parish (New Orleans), the death rate for African-Americans was 1.7-4 times higher than for whites; as a whole in Orleans parish, 68% of deaths (459 out of 680 total) were black people, almost exactly the same percentage of the population there as that found in the 2000 U.S. Census (which recorded 67%).Brunkard, Joan, Gonza Namulanda and Roult Ratard. 2008.

Sixty eight percent felt the response would have been quicker if those trapped had been white and wealthier and 61% indicated that they felt the government did not care about them. Ninety-three percent of the respondents were African- Americans. Washington Post/ Kaiser Foundation/ Harvard University. \\"Survey of Hurricane Katrina Evacuees.\\" Reverend Jesse Jackson claimed that racism was a factor in the slow government response, stating that \\"many black people feel that their race, their property conditions and their voting patterns have been a factor in the response.\\" Commentator Lou Dobbs of CNN has claimed that local officials should bear some responsibility, saying that \\"the city of New Orleans is 70% black, its mayor is black, its principal power structure is black, and if there is a failure to the black Americans, who live in poverty and in the city of New Orleans, those officials have to bear much of the responsibility.\\"\\"Lou Dobbs Tonight (transcript).\\" CNN.

Former Mayor of Atlanta and UN Ambassador Andrew Young, who was born in New Orleans, had a more nuanced reaction to the disaster: \\"I was surprised and not surprised. It's not just a lack of preparedness. I think the easy answer is to say that these are poor people and black people and so the government doesn't give a damn ... there might be some truth to that. But I think we've got to see this as a serious problem of the long-term neglect of an environmental system on which our nation depends.\\"Purdum, Todd S. \\"Across U.S., Outrage at Response.\\" The New York Times.

Some claim that the media referred to African Americans as \\"looters\\" while white victims were labeled \\"survivors\\" and \\"victims\\". On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC, A Concert for Hurricane Relief, rapper Kanye West was a featured speaker. Controversy arose when West was presenting, as he deviated from the prepared script, criticizing the slow federal response. Actor Mike Myers, with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he said \\"George Bush doesn't care about black people.\\" At this point, telethon producer Rick Kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to Chris Tucker, who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds. Still, West's comment reached much of the United States. West also went on to say that America has been set to help the poor as slow as possible. Some argue that authorities do not want the poor black community returning to the city in an act to make the city more white. All around FEMA response was found to be slow and unfair. A study conducted by graduate students at The University of Connecticut's Department of Public Policy found that FEMA trailers were offered 63% in St. Bernard Parish, a predominantly white area, and 13% in the Lower Ninth Ward, a predominantly black neighborhood. =Lack of provision for people with disabilities= Disaster planners were criticized for failing to take the needs of people with disabilities into consideration. Transportation, communication and shelters did not make provision for people with mobility, cognitive or communication disabilities. Cases were reported of wheelchair users being left behind, no provision being made for guide dogs, essential equipment and medication not being available or left behind. Disability advocacy organizations criticized local, state and federal emergency authorities for not including disabled people in their planning and consultation. The National Organization on Disability assessed the post-Katrina situation of evacuees with disabilities: the \\"Special Needs for Katrina Evacuees Project\\" research results were submitted to Congress in two briefings. =Characterization of displaced persons as \\"refugees\\"= Many media agencies in the U.S. and around the world were criticized for using the word \\"refugee\\" to describe someone that was displaced by Hurricane Katrina.Noveck, Jocelyn. \\"The use of word \\"refugee\\" touches a nerve .\\" Seattle Times. September 7, 2005. Retrieved on July 18, 2006. Many, particularly African-Americans, have argued that using the term \\"refugee\\" implies a sort of \\"second class\\" status, while others have argued that using terms such as \\"evacuees\\" or \\"displaced\\" is too clinical and not dramatic enough to portray the current situation. President Bush addressed this issue in the following statement: \\"The people we're talking about are not refugees. They are Americans and they need the help and love and compassion of our fellow citizens.\\" Accordingly, most of the major media outlets in the U.S. eliminated the usage of \\"refugees\\", with a few exceptions. Discrimination against non-U.S. citizens There was some criticism by tourists that rescue crews were giving preferential treatment to American citizens first. For example, some British tourists trapped in a New Orleans hotel accused the authorities of preferential treatment for Americans during the evacuation as Katrina approached.Townsend, Mark. \\"You're on your own, Britain's victims told.\\" The Guardian.

In the days before the storm, Mayor Nagin was particularly blunt in regards to foreign tourists, stating, \\"The only thing I can say to them is I hope they have a hotel room, and it's a least on the third floor and up. Unfortunately, unless they can rent a car to get out of town, which I doubt they can at this point, they're probably in the position of riding the storm out.\\" Hotel managers also criticised the treatment of tourists, with one noting they were treated worse than the people in the Superdome.

Origins and history The exact origin of the superstition is unknown, though it was recorded in Notes and Queries as being said by children in 1909: > \\"My two daughters are in the habit of saying 'Rabbits!' on the first day of > each month. The word must be spoken aloud, and be the first word said in the > month. It brings luck for that month. Other children, I find, use the same > formula.\\" Citing Notes and Queries 10s:11 (1909), 208 In response to this note another contributor said that his daughter believed that the outcome would be a present, and that the word must be spoken up the chimney to be most effective; another pointed out that the word rabbit was often used in expletives, and suggested that the superstition may be a survival of the ancient belief in swearing as a means of avoiding evil. Citing The English Dialect Dictionary (1905) Vol. 5, p. 2. People continue to express curiosity about the origins of this superstition and draw upon it for inspiration in making calendars suggestive of the Labors of the Months, thus linking the rabbit rabbit superstition to seasonal fertility. It appeared in a work of fiction in 1922: > \\"Why,\\" the man in the brown hat laughed at him, \\"I thought everybody knew > 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.' If you say 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit'‚Äîthree times, > just like that‚Äîfirst thing in the morning on the first of the month, even > before you say your prayers, you'll get a present before the end of the > month.\\"Robert Lynd, Solomon in All his Glory (London, 1922), p. 49. Chapter 1 of the Trixie Belden story The Mystery of the Emeralds (1962) is titled ‚ÄúRabbit! Rabbit!‚Äù and discusses the tradition: > Trixie Belden awoke slowly, with the sound of a summer rain beating against > her window. She half-opened her eyes, stretched her arms above her head, and > then, catching sight of a large sign tied to the foot of her bed, yelled > out, ‚ÄúRabbit!

If > you say it again in the morning, before you‚Äôve said another word, your wish > comes true.‚Äù Trixie laughed.\\"Kathryn Kenny, The Mystery of the Emeralds > (1962), p. 1. In the United States the tradition appears especially well known in northern New England although, like all folklore, determining its exact area of distribution is difficult. The superstition may be related to the broader belief in the rabbit or hare being a \\"lucky\\" animal, as exhibited in the practice of carrying a rabbit's foot for luck. During the mid-1990s, U.S. children's cable channel Nickelodeon helped popularize the superstition in the United States as part of its \\"Nick Days,\\" where during commercial breaks it would show an ad about the significance of the current date, whether it be an actual holiday, a largely uncelebrated unofficial holiday, or a made-up day if nothing else is going on that specific day (the latter would be identified as a \\"Nickelodeon holiday\\"). Nickelodeon would promote the last day of each month as \\"Rabbit Rabbit Day\\" and to remind kids to say it the next day, unless the last day of that specific month was an actual holiday, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve. This practice stopped by the late 1990s. Rabbits have not always been thought of as lucky, however. In the 19th century, for example, fishermen would not say the word while at sea, in South Devon, to see a white rabbit in one's village when a person was very ill was regarded as a sure sign that the person was about to die. In other traditions There is another folk tradition which may use a variation \\"Rabbit\\", \\"Bunny\\", \\"I hate/love Grey Rabbits\\" or \\"White Rabbit\\" to ward off smoke that the wind is directing into your face when gathered around a campfire.http://folklore.usc.edu/?p=27779 It is thought that this tradition may be related to the tradition of invoking the rabbit on the first of the month. Others conjecture that it may originate with a North American First Nation story about smoke resembling rabbit fur. This tradition may be more of a social tradition in a group setting than a genuine belief that certain words will change the wind direction, and may be more of a childhood tradition than an adult one. Children have sometimes adapted from Rabbit to \\"Pink Elephant\\" or other comical derivatives.https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d6eki/what_did_you_do_as_a_kid_when_campfire_smoke_blew/ Because of this more mutable usage, historical record of this is even more scarce than other more static meanings. As with all folklore, its truth is made evident even in its only occasional fulfillment: should the wind then appear to change direction, others will interpret the use of such an expression as evidence of its effectiveness and will then tend to adopt and repeat its use. That multiple instances of its ineffectiveness also exist is discounted in light of the \\"fact\\" that it appeared to work once. Variants As with most folklore, which is traditionally spread by word of mouth, there are numerous variants of the superstition, in some cases specific to a certain time period or region. * \\"When I was a very little boy I was advised to always murmur 'White rabbits' on the first of every month if I wanted to be lucky.

Overview EOS was preceded by and was binary executable compatible with the CDC VSOS operating system for Cyber 205. Like VSOS, EOS had demand paged virtual memory (the VS part) with 2 pages sizes for improved virtual memory performance with the ETA's faster hardware pipelines. Though it had roots in the interactive Livermore Time Sharing System (LTSS), VSOS was focused as a batch-oriented operating system. VSOS was not run at very many institutions and its application-oriented performance, while the historic focus for supercomputing, set its features behind the times because of its limited user base. To address this feature deficiency and to make the operating system more \\"normal to use\\", the VSOS characteristics were married with UNIX characteristics in a hybrid OS. The OS was intended to be effective for both batch work that drove the hardware to its maximum or for interactive use in development from a UNIX workstation. EOS was written mainly in Cybil, a Pascal-like programming language created by Control Data for its later Cyber operating systems. It was a new effort, as VSOS was implemented in IMPL, a Fortran-like language created for the LTSS implementation. The command line appearance of all these systems was similar to the lineage going back to UNIVAC EXEC*8. EOS was released with early hardware deliveries and had some of the typical problems for early OS releases. Some customers delayed payment for their supercomputer installations. ETA later released a port of UNIX for the ETA-10 line, which was more quickly accepted by their customer base.

Aluminum provides a better conductivity to weight ratio than copper, and therefore is also used for wiring power grids, including overhead power transmission lines and local power distribution lines, as well as for power wiring of some airplanes.Telecommunications and networks, Khateeb M. Hussain, Donna HussainAircraft Wire. mechanicsupport.com Utility companies have used aluminum wire for electrical transmission in power grids since around the late 1800s to the early 1900s. It has cost and weight advantages over copper wires. Aluminum wire in power transmission and distribution applications is still the preferred material today. In North American residential construction, aluminum wire was used for wiring entire houses for a short time from the 1960s to the mid-1970s during a period of high copper prices. Electrical devices (outlets, switches, lighting, fans, etc.) at the time were not designed with the particular properties of the aluminum wire being used in mind, and there were some issues related to the properties of the wire itself, making the installations with aluminum wire much more susceptible to problems. Revised manufacturing standards for both the wire and the devices were developed to reduce the problems. Existing homes with this older aluminum wiring used in branch circuits present a potential fire hazard. Materials New York City utility lines in 1890. Aluminum wire has been used as an electrical conductor for a considerable period of time, particularly by electrical utilities related to power transmission lines in use shortly after the beginning of modern power distribution systems being constructed starting in the late 1880s. Aluminum wire requires a larger wire gauge than copper wire to carry the same current, but is still less expensive than copper wire for a particular application. electrical power distribution system supplied by a utility Aluminum alloys used for electrical conductors are only approximately 61% as conductive as copper of the same cross-section, but aluminum's density is 30.5% that of copper. Accordingly, one pound of aluminum has the same current carrying capacity as two pounds of copper. Since copper costs about three times as much as aluminum by weight (roughly USD $3/lbCopper prices and copper price charts vs. USD $1/lbAluminum Prices and Aluminum Price Charts ), aluminum wires are one-sixth the cost of copper wire of the same conductivity. The lower weight of aluminum wires in particular makes these electrical conductors well suited for use in power distribution systems by electrical utilities, as supporting towers or structures only need to support half the weight of wires to carry the same current. In the early 1960s when there was a housing construction boom in North America and the price of copper spiked, aluminum building wire was manufactured using utility grade AA-1350 aluminum alloy in sizes small enough to be used for lower load branch circuits in homes. In the late 1960s problems and failures related to branch circuit connections for building wire made with the utility grade AA-1350 alloy aluminum began to surface, resulting in a re-evaluation of the use of that alloy for building wire and an identification of the need for newer alloys to produce aluminum building wire. The first 8000 series electric conductor alloy, still widely used in some applications, was developed and patented in 1972 by Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa).Patent application filed in 1969 This alloy, along with AA-8030 (patented by Olin in 1973) and AA-8176 (patented by Southwire in 1975 and 1980) perform mechanically like copper. Unlike the older AA-1350 alloy previously used, these AA-8000 series alloys also retain their tensile strength after the standard current cycle test or the current-cycle submersion test (CCST), as described in ANSI C119.4:2004. Depending on the annealing grade, AA-8176 may elongate up to 30% with less springback effect and possesses a higher yield strength (, for a cold-worked AA-8076 wire). A home with aluminum wiring installed prior to the mid-1970s (as the stock of pre-1972 aluminum wire was permitted to be used up) likely has wire made with the older AA-1350 alloy that was developed for power transmission. The AA-1350 aluminum alloy was more prone to problems related to branch circuit wiring in homes due to mechanical properties that made it more susceptible to failures resulting from the electrical devices being used at that time combined with poor workmanship. The 1977 Beverly Hills Supper Club fire was a notable incident triggered by poorly-installed aluminum wiring. Modern building construction Aluminum wire used for a modern overhead service drop from a utility to a house Aluminum building wiring for modern construction is manufactured with AA-8000 series aluminum alloy (sometimes referred to as \\"new technology\\" aluminum wiring) as specified by the industry standards such as the National Electrical Code (NEC). The use of larger gauge stranded aluminum wire (larger than #8AWG) is fairly common in much of North America for modern residential construction. Aluminum wire is used in residential applications for lower voltage service feeders from the utility to the building. This is installed with materials and methods as specified by the local electrical utility companies. Also, larger aluminum stranded building wire made with AA-8000 series alloy of aluminum is used for electrical services (e.g. service entrance conductors from the utility connection to the service breaker panel) and for larger branch circuits such as for sub-panels, ranges, clothes dryers and air-conditioning units. Larger electrical cable that has stranded aluminum wires with an outer sheath used for service entrance feeders from a meter to a panel In the United States, solid aluminum wires made with AA-8000 series aluminum alloy are allowed for 15-A or 20-A branch circuit wiring according to the National Electrical Code. The terminations need to be rated for aluminum wire, which can be problematic. This is particularly a problem with wire to wire connections made with twist- on connectors. As of 2017 most twist-on connectors for typical smaller branch circuit wire sizes, even those designed to connect copper to aluminum wiring, are not rated for aluminum-to-aluminum connections, with one exception being the Marette #63 or #65 used in Canada but not approved by UL for use in the United States. Also, the size of the aluminum wire needs to be larger compared to copper wire used for the same circuit due to the increased resistance of the aluminum alloys. For example, a 15-A branch circuit supplying standard lighting fixtures can be installed with either #14AWG copper building wire or #12AWG aluminum building wire according to the NEC. However, smaller solid aluminum branch circuit wiring is almost never used for residential construction in North America. Older homes Solid aluminum branch circuit wire (top) and solid copper branch circuit wire (bottom) When utility grade AA-1350 alloy aluminum wire was first used in branch circuit wiring in the early 1960s, solid aluminum wire was installed the same way as copper wire with the same electrical devices. For smaller branch circuits with solid wires (15-/20-A circuits) typical connections of an electrical wire to an electrical device are usually made by wrapping the wire around a screw on the device, also called a terminal, and then tightening the screw. At around the same time the use of steel screws became more common than brass screws for electrical devices. Over time, many of these terminations with solid aluminum wire began to fail due to improper connection techniques and the dissimilar metals having different resistances and significantly different coefficients of thermal expansion, as well as problems with properties of the solid wires. These connection failures generated heat under electrical load and caused overheated connections. Larger stranded aluminum wire at termination lugs of a disconnect The larger size stranded aluminum wires don't have the same historical problems as solid aluminum wires, and the common terminations for larger size wires are dual-rated terminations called lugs. These lugs are typically made with a coated aluminum alloy, which can accommodate either an aluminum wire or a copper wire. Larger stranded aluminum wiring with proper terminations is generally considered safe, since long-term installations have proven its reliability. Problems The use of older solid aluminum wiring in residential construction has resulted in failures of connections at electrical devices, has been implicated in house fires according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and in some areas it may be difficult to obtain homeowners insurance for a house with older aluminum wiring. There are several possible reasons why these connections failed. The two main reasons were improper installations (poor workmanship) and the differences in the coefficient of expansion between aluminum wire used in the 1960s to mid-1970s and the terminations, particularly when the termination was a steel screw on an electrical device. The reported hazards are associated with older solid aluminum branch circuit wiring (smaller than ) =Improper installations= Many terminations of aluminum wire installed in the 1960s and 1970s that were properly installed continue to operate with no problems. However, problems can develop in the future, particularly if connections were not properly installed initially. Improper installation, or poor workmanship, includes: not abrading the wires, not applying a corrosion inhibitor, not wrapping wires around terminal screws, wrapping wires around terminal screws the wrong way, and inadequate torque on the connection screws. There can also be problems with connections made with too much torque on the connection screw as it causes damage to the wire, particularly with the softer aluminum wire. =Coefficient of expansion and creep= Thermal expansion rates of wiring metals: Aluminum (highest), brass, copper and steel (lowest) Most of the problems related to aluminum wire are typically associated with older (pre-1972) AA-1350 alloy solid aluminum wire, sometimes referred to as \\"old technology\\" aluminum wiring, as the properties of that wire result in significantly more expansion and contraction than copper wire or modern day AA-8000 series aluminum wire. Older solid aluminum wire also had some problems with a property called creep, which results in the wire permanently deforming or relaxing over time under load. Aluminum wire used before the mid-1970s had a somewhat higher rate of creep, but a more significant issue was that aluminum wire critically had a coefficient of expansion that varied significantly from steel screws commonly used in lieu of brass screws around this time for terminations at devices such as outlets and switches. Aluminum and steel expand and contract at significantly different rates under thermal load, so a connection can become loose, particularly for older terminations initially installed with inadequate torque of the screws combined with creep of the aluminum over time. Loose connections get progressively worse over time. This cycle results from the connection loosening slightly, with a reduced contact area at the connection leading to overheating, and allowing intermetallic steel/aluminum compounds to be formed between the conductor and the terminal screw. This resulted in a higher resistance junction, leading to additional overheating. Although many believe that oxidation was the issue, studies have shown that oxidation was not significant in these cases. =Electrical device ratings= Older solid aluminum wire at older receptacle with steel terminal screws Many electrical devices used in the 1960s had smaller plain steel terminal screws, which made the attachment of the aluminum wires being used at that time to these devices much more vulnerable to problems. In the late 1960s, a device specification known as CU/AL (meaning copper-aluminum) was created that specified standards for devices intended for use with aluminum wire. Some of these devices used larger undercut screw terminals to more securely hold the wire. Special CO/ALR rated wall outlet and wall switch Unfortunately, CU/AL switches and receptacles failed to work well enough with aluminum wire, and a new specification called CO/ALR (meaning copper-aluminum, revised) was created. These devices employ brass screw terminals that are designed to act as a similar metal to aluminum and to expand at a similar rate, and the screws have even deeper undercuts. The CO/ALR rating is only available for standard light switches and receptacles; CU/AL is the standard connection marking for circuit breakers and larger equipment. =Oxidation= Most metals (with a few exceptions, such as gold) oxidize freely when exposed to air. Aluminium oxide is not an electrical conductor, but rather an electrical insulator. Consequently, the flow of electrons through the oxide layer can be greatly impeded. However, since the oxide layer is only a few nanometers thick, the added resistance is not noticeable under most conditions. When aluminum wire is terminated properly, the mechanical connection breaks the thin, brittle layer of oxide to form an excellent electrical connection. Unless this connection is loosened, there is no way for oxygen to penetrate the connection point to form further oxide. In an old apartment, the result of a qualified electrician's improperly-joined aluminum and copper wires. If inadequate torque is applied to the electrical device termination screw or if the devices are not CO/ALR rated (or at least CU/AL-rated for breakers and larger equipment) this can result in an inadequate connection of the aluminum wire. Also, due to the significant difference in thermal expansion rates of older aluminum wire and steel termination screws connections can loosen over time allowing the formation of some additional oxide on the wire. However, oxidation was found not to be a substantial factor in failures of aluminum wire terminations. =Joining aluminum and copper wires= Another issue is the joining of aluminum wire to copper wire. In addition to the oxidation that occurs on the surface of aluminum wires which can cause a poor connection, aluminum and copper are dissimilar metals. As a result, galvanic corrosion can occur in the presence of an electrolyte, causing these connections to become unstable over time. Upgrades and repairs Several upgrades or repairs are available for homes with older pre-1970s aluminum branch circuit wiring: *Completely rewiring the house with copper wires (usually cost prohibitive) *\\"Pig-tailing\\" which involves splicing a short length of copper wire (pigtail) to the original aluminum wire, and then attaching the copper wire to the existing electrical device. The splice of the copper pigtail to the existing aluminum wire can be accomplished with special crimp connectors, special miniature lug-type connectors, or approved twist-on connectors (with special installation procedures). Pig-tailing generally saves time and money, and is possible as long as the wiring itself isn't damaged. AL to CU Pigtail done with COPALUM crimp connectors AlumiConn connectors used to connect copper pigtails to older aluminum branch circuit wires at an outlet However, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) currently recommends only two alternatives for a \\"permanent repair\\" using the pig-tailing method. The more extensively tested method uses special crimp-on connectors called COPALUM connectors. As of April 2011, the CPSC has also recognized miniature lug-type connectors called AlumiConn connectors. The CPSC considers the use of pigtails with wire nuts a temporary repair, and even as a temporary repair recommends special installation procedures, and notes that there can still be hazards with attempting the repairs. COPALUM connectors use a special crimping system that creates a cold weld between the copper and aluminum wire, and is considered a permanent, maintenance-free repair. However, there may not be sufficient length of wires in enclosures to permit a special crimping tool to be used, and the resulting connections are sometimes too large to install in existing enclosures due to limited space (or \\"box fill\\"). Installing an enclosure extender for unfinished surfaces, replacing the enclosure with a larger one or installing an additional adjacent enclosure can be done to increase the available space. Also, COPALUM connectors are costly to install, require special tools that cannot simply be purchased and electricians certified to use them by the manufacturer, and it can sometimes be very difficult to find local electricians certified to install these connectors. The AlumiConn miniature lug connector can also be used for a permanent repair. The only special tool required for an electrician installing them is a special torque screwdriver that should be readily available to qualified electrical contractors. Proper torque on the connectors set screws is critical to having an acceptable repair. However, use of the Alumiconn connectors is a relatively newer repair option for older aluminum wiring compared to other methods, and use of these connectors can have some of the same or similar problems with limited enclosure space as the COPALUM connectors. Ideal no. 65 Al-Cu twist-on wire nut with distinctive purple color Special twist-on connectors (or \\"wire nuts\\") are available for joining aluminum to copper wire, which are pre-filled with an antioxidant compound made of zinc dust in polybutene base with silicon dioxide added to the compound to abrade the wires. As of 2014 there was only one twist-on connector rated or \\"UL Listed\\" for connecting aluminum and copper branch circuit wires in the U.S., which is the Ideal no. 65 \\"Twister Al/Cu wire connector\\". These special twist-on connectors have a distinctive purple color, have been UL Listed for aluminum to copper branch circuit wire connections since 1995, and according to the manufacturer's current literature are \\"perfect for pig-tailing a copper conductor onto aluminum branch circuit wiring in retrofit applications\\". The CPSC still considers the use of twist-on connectors, including the Ideal no. 65 \\"Twister Al/Cu wire connector\\", to be a temporary repair. According to the CPSC, even using (listed) twist-on connectors to attach copper pigtails to older aluminum wires as a temporary repair requires special installation procedures, including abrading and pre- twisting the wires. However, the manufacturer's instructions for the Ideal no. 65 Twister only recommends pre-twisting the wires, and does not state it is required. Also, the instructions do not mention physically abrading the wires as recommended by the CPSC, although the manufacturer current literature states the pre-filled \\"compound cuts aluminum oxide\\". Some researchers have criticized the UL listing/tests for this wire connector, and there have been reported problems with tests (without pre-twisting) and installations. However, it is unknown if the reported installation problems were associated with unqualified persons attempting these repairs, or not using recommended special installation procedures (such as abrading and pre-twisting the wires as recommended by the CPSC for older aluminum wire, or at least pre-twisting the wires as recommended by Ideal for their connectors). The use of newer CO/ALR rated devices (switches and receptacles) can be used to replace older devices that did not have the proper rating in homes with aluminum branch circuit wiring to reduce the hazards. These devices are reportedly tested and listed for both AA-1350 and AA-8000 series aluminum wire, and are acceptable according to the National Electrical Code. However, some manufacturers of CO/ALR devices recommend periodically checking/tightening the terminal screws on these devices which can be hazardous for unqualified individuals to attempt, and there is criticism of their use as a permanent repair as some CO/ALR devices have failed in tests when connected to \\"old technology\\" aluminum wire. Furthermore, just installing CO/ALR devices (switches and receptacles) doesn't address potential hazards associated with other connections such as those at ceiling fans, lights and equipment.

It pursues the objective to create and establish an open and standardized software architecture for automotive electronic control units (ECUs). Goals include the scalability to different vehicle and platform variants, transferability of software, the consideration of availability and safety requirements, a collaboration between various partners, sustainable use of natural resources, and maintainability during the whole product lifecycle.  History  The AUTOSAR development partnership was formed in July 2003 by Bavarian Motor Works (BMW), Robert Bosch GmbH, Continental AG, Daimler AG (formerly Daimler- Benz, then DaimlerChrysler), Siemens VDO, and Volkswagen to develop and establish an open industry standard for automotive electrical-electronic (E/E) architecture. In November 2003, Ford Motor Company joined as a Core Partner, and in December, Groupe PSA (formerly PSA Peugeot Citro√´n) and Toyota Motor Corporation joined. The following November, General Motors also became a Core Partner. After Siemens VDO was acquired by Continental in February 2008, it ceased being an independent Core Partner of AUTOSAR. Since 2003, AUTOSAR has provided four major releases of the standardized automotive software architecture for its Classic Platform and one release of Acceptance Tests. The work of AUTOSAR can be divided into three phases: * Phase I (2004‚Äì2006): Basic development of the standard (releases 1.0, 2.0, 2.1) * Phase II (2007‚Äì2009): Extension of the standard in architecture and methodology (releases 3.0, 3.1, 4.0) * Phase III (2010‚Äì2013): Maintenance and selected improvements (releases 3.2, 4.1, 4.2) In 2013, the AUTOSAR consortium entered a continuous working mode for its Classic Platform to maintain the standard and provide selected improvements, including releases R4.2, and 1.0 of Acceptance Tests. In 2016, work on the Adaptive Platform began. A first release (17-03) was published in early 2017, followed by release 17-10 in October 2017 and release 18-03 in March 2018. With release 18-10 in October 2018, the major development activities were finally published in a joint release of AUTOSAR Classic, Adaptive, and Foundation.  Concept and goals  AUTOSAR provides a set of specifications that describes basic software modules, defines application interfaces and builds a common development methodology based on standardized exchange format. Basic software modules made available by the AUTOSAR layered software architecture can be used in vehicles of different manufacturers and electronic components of different suppliers, thereby reducing expenditures for research and development and mastering the growing complexity of automotive electronic and software architectures. Based on this guiding principle, AUTOSAR has been devised to pave the way for innovative electronic systems that further improve performance, safety, and environmental friendliness and to facilitate the exchange and update of software and hardware over the service life of the vehicle. It aims to be prepared for the upcoming technologies and to improve cost-efficiency without compromising quality.  Software architecture  AUTOSAR uses a three-layer architecture: * Basic Software: standardized software modules (mostly) with no explicit automotive job, but offers services needed to run the functional part of the upper software layer. * Runtime Environment (RTE): Middleware which abstracts from the network topology for the inter- and intra-ECU information exchange between the application software components and between the Basic Software and the applications. * Application Layer: application software components that interact with the runtime environment. = Methodology = * System Configuration Description includes all system information and the information agreed between different ECUs (e.g. definition of bus signals). * ECU extract: contains the information from the System Configuration Description needed for a specific ECU (e.g. those signals where a specific ECU has access to). *ECU Configuration Description: contains all basic software configuration information that is local to a specific ECU. Use this information to build the executable software, the code of the basic software modules and the code of the software components out of it. = Classic Platform = The AUTOSAR Classic Platform is the standard for embedded real-time ECUs based on OSEK. Its main deliverable is specifications. The AUTOSAR Classic Platform architecture distinguishes on the highest abstraction level between three software layers that run on a microcontroller: application, runtime environment (RTE) and basic software (BSW). The application software layer is mostly hardware independent. Communication between software components and access to BSW happens via RTE, which represents the full interface for applications. The BSW is divided in three major layers and complex drivers: * Services * Electronic control unit (ECU) abstraction * Microcontroller abstraction Services are divided further, into functional groups representing the infrastructure for system, memory and communication services. One essential concept of the Classic Platform is the Virtual Functional Bus (VFB). This virtual bus is an abstract set of RTEs that are not yet deployed to specific ECUs and decouples the applications from the infrastructure. It communicates via dedicated ports, which means that the communication interfaces of the application software must be mapped to these ports. The VFB handles communication within the individual ECU and between ECUs. From an application point of view, no detailed knowledge of lower-level technologies or dependencies is required. This supports hardware-independent development and usage of application software. The Classic Platform also enables the integration of non-AUTOSAR systems such as GENIVI by using the Franca Interface Definition Language (Franca IDL). = Adaptive Platform = New use- cases required the development of the Adaptive Platform. One prominent example is highly automated driving, in the context of which the driver temporarily and/or partially transfers responsibility for driving to the vehicle. This can require communication with traffic infrastructure (e.g. traffic signs and -lights), cloud servers (e.g. to access the latest traffic information or map data), or the use of microprocessors and high-performance computing hardware for parallel processing, e.g., graphics processing units (GPUs). Further, Car-2-X applications require interaction to vehicles and off-board systems. That means that the system has to provide secure on-board communication, support of cross-domain computing platforms, smartphone integration, integration of non-AUTOSAR systems, and so on. Also, cloud-based services will require dedicated means for security, such as secure cloud interaction and emergency vehicle preemption. They will enable remote and distributed services, such as remote diagnostics, over the air(OTA) update, repair, and exchange handling. To support dynamic deployment of customer applications and to provide an environment for applications that require high-end computing power AUTOSAR is currently standardizing the AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform. Its core is an operating system based on the POSIX standard. The operating system can be used from the application via a subset of the POSIX according to IEEE1003.13 (namely PSE51). One of the key features of the Adaptive Platform is service-oriented communication since the Platform is based on the Service - Oriented Architecture. The Adaptive AUTOSAR is developed and written using the C++ which is an Object Oriented Programming language. The communication protocol used for the in-vehicle networking using the Adaptive platform is SOME/IP based on the Ethernet Communication Protocol. For the Adaptive Platform two types of interfaces are available: services and application programming interfaces (APIs). The platform consists of functional clusters which are grouped in services and the AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform foundation. Functional clusters: * Assemble functions of the Adaptive Platform * Define clustering of requirements specification * Describe behavior of software platform from application and network perspective * Do not constrain the final SW design of the architecture implementing the Adaptive Platform. Functional clusters in AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform have to have at least one instance per (virtual) machine while services may be distributed in the in-car network. Adaptive Platform services include: * Update and Configuration management * State Management * Network Management * Diagnostics The AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform contains both specification and code. In comparison to the Classic Platform, AUTOSAR develops an implementation to shorten the validation cycle and illustrate the underlying concepts. This implementation is available to all AUTOSAR partners. = Foundation = The purpose of the Foundation standard is to enforce interoperability between the AUTOSAR platforms. The foundation contains common requirements and technical specifications (for example protocols) shared between the AUTOSAR platforms, and the common methodology. = Acceptance Tests = In 2014, AUTOSAR Acceptance Tests were introduced to minimize test efforts and costs. Acceptance Test Specifications are system test specifications using the specified interfaces of the respective Platform. Also, they are considering the specified behavior on the bus. They can be seen as a black box test case for a given platform function. The specification of standard acceptance tests contributes to these objectives. = Standardized Application Interfaces = Standardization of functional interfaces across manufacturers and suppliers and standardization of the interfaces between the different software layers is seen as a basis for achieving the technical goals of AUTOSAR. Only by standardizing concrete interface contents in their physical and temporal representation allows achieving the needed integration compatibility.  Organization  AUTOSAR defined six different levels of membership. The contribution of partners varies depending on the type of partnership: * Core Partner * Strategic Partner * Premium Partner * Associate Partner * Development Partner * Attendee Core Partners include the founding partners BMW, Bosch, Continental, Daimler AG, Ford, General Motors, PSA Peugeot Citro√´n, Toyota, and Volkswagen. These companies are responsible for organization, administration and control of the AUTOSAR development partnership. Within this core, the Executive Board defines the overall strategy and roadmap. The Steering Committee manages day-to-day non-technical operations and admission of partners, public relations and contractual issues. The Chairman and Deputy of Chairman, appointed for one year, represent the Steering Committee for that purpose. The AUTOSAR Spokesperson takes over the communication with the outside world. Strategic Partners are appointed for a period of two years from the circle of Premium Partners and support the project leader team in the various technical, organizational and everyday processes. They also give new strategic inputs to the project leader round. Premium and Development members contribute to work packages coordinated and monitored by the Project Leader Team established by the Core Partners. Associate partners are making use of the standard documents AUTOSAR has already released. Attendees are currently participating with Academic collaboration and non-commercial projects. As of mid-2019, more than 270 companies participate in the AUTOSAR development partnership.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 5, 1996. In the episode, a referendum is placed on the ballot that will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported. After learning that Apu will be deported if the measure passes, Homer helps him prepare for a United States citizenship test so that he can become a legal citizen. The episode was written by David S. Cohen, and directed by Susie Dietter. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony. The title of the episode is a parody of William Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 8.2, and was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot A brown bear roams the streets of Springfield, frightening the townspeople, so the police subdue it with a tranquilizer dart. Homer leads a march of angry citizens to city hall, where they demand Mayor Quimby do something to protect them from bears. After Quimby deploys a bear patrol, Homer is angry to learn his taxes have increased by $5 to maintain the patrol. Another crowd of angry citizens marches to the mayor's office demanding lower taxes. To appease them, Quimby blames the higher taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will force all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported. Springfield residents start to harass local immigrants. At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu confides in Homer that he is in fact, an illegal immigrant. Apu fears that if Proposition 24 passes, he will be forced to leave the United States, since his visa expired many years ago. Apu visits Fat Tony to obtain false citizenship. Feeling guilty about committing fraud and abandoning his Indian heritage, he destroys the fake passport. After seeing how distraught Apu is at the prospect of being deported, Homer vows that he and his family will help him. Lisa discovers that Apu will not have to leave if he passes a citizenship test. Homer agrees to tutor Apu, but is unable to teach him accurate historical facts needed to pass the exam. After Lisa intervenes, Apu passes the test and becomes a US citizen. At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests deporting immigrants is awful because they help the country thrive. He inspires them to vote no on Proposition 24, but it still passes with 95% of the vote. When Proposition 24 is enacted, Groundskeeper Willie is the only resident deported. Production \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\" was written by David S. Cohen and directed by Susie Dietter.. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony. Much of the inspiration for the episode came from news reports of bears roaming streets in Southern California around the time when the episode was in production. Cohen said that when a bear swims in somebody's pool or goes in somebody's garbage can, it becomes a popular news item in California. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, commented that the news reports often create an anti-bear hysteria, and that is one of the inspirations for the episode. Another inspiration for the episode came from California's Proposition 187, which proposed the rescinding of employment rights and benefits from illegal immigrants. Cohen decided to name the referendum \\"Proposition 24\\" because 24 was the number he had on his Little League Baseball uniform. Cohen commented that \\"the main theme of the episode is illegal immigration and anti-immigration sentiment, which is a big issue here in California. So both the intro with the bear and the main theme are yanked from the California headlines.\\" Apu studying computer science is based on Cohen's own academic background, where he met and became friends with Indian people in the department. Similarly, the scene where Apu does an in-depth explanation of what caused the American Civil War, only for the test taker to respond with \\"just say slavery\\", is something that actually happened to a friend of Cohen when she got her citizenship test taken. The final script of the episode was \\"very close\\" to Cohen's first draft. \\"I was looking at the old drafts and this episode probably changed as little as any script I've written from the original inception to the final aired version\\", Cohen said. Oakley commented that some writer's scripts get rewritten many times but Cohen's \\"usually do not get rewritten that much because they are so good\\". Oakley added that Cohen has a very distinctive comedy style so there are certain jokes in the episode that \\"just really sound like Cohen\\". Something Oakley and his partner Josh Weinstein wanted to do while they were show runners of The Simpsons was to explore side-characters, such as Apu, \\"a little deeper\\". Apu's origin is revealed in this episode, and Oakley is proud of being the one who suggested that. Another character that was explored deeper in their period as show runners was Ned Flanders in the episode \\"Hurricane Neddy\\". Cultural references The episode's title is based on William Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing. The original title for the episode was going to be \\"The Anti-Immigrant Song\\", in reference to Led Zeppelin's song \\"Immigrant Song\\". A sign held by a protester outside the Kwik-E-Mart says \\"The only good foreigner is Rod Stewart!\\", a reference to the British singer. Brad Bird, an American director who has worked as executive consultant and director on The Simpsons, can briefly be seen in the crowd that complains to Mayor Quimby. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\" finished 49th in the ratings for the week of April 29 to May 5, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 8.2. Retrieved on January 2, 2009. The episode was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, Beverly Hills, 90210, and Melrose Place. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented positively on the episode, and said that \\"if any show's taken a more unusual path to a story about xenophobia, I've not seen it.\\" He praised the bear scenes, which he thought was the episode's most \\"amusing\\" part. The review continued, \\"The parts with the immigrants are also good, especially since they make their point deftly. Add to that the hilarious sound of 'American Apu' and this is a strong program.\\" Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Homer tries to teach Apu American history, noting Homer's \\"relevant and complex\\" diagram of a stovepipe hat. Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \\"One of the most outspoken, and certainly angriest of episodes succeeds as a savage satire on the scapegoating of immigrants. Homer has never been so frighteningly dumb, although he does come through with a rousing liberal speech.\\" In 2000, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening named this his third favorite episode of the show. The episode received a negative review from Dave Foster of DVD Times. He considered \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\" to be one of the season's most \\"tiring\\" episodes, \\"mostly because Apu is not a strong enough character to focus an episode on no matter how much writer David Cohen develops him\\". Foster commented that the episode deals with a political issue which is \\"difficult to broach in twenty minutes and is therefore reached and sewn up in a rather haphazard manner\\". The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to \\"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\\", and to figure out what it is \\"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies\\". Some questions asked in the courses include: \\"What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? What aspects of them are used to make the points? How is the satire conveyed: through language? Drawing? Music? Is the behavior of each character consistent with his/her character as developed over the years? Can we identify elements of the historical/political context that the writers are satirizing? What is the difference between satire and parody?\\" In the episode, after the creation of the Bear Patrol, bear sightings decrease to zero, so Homer concludes that the Bear Patrol must be working. Lisa attempts to demonstrate Homer's logical fallacy by the example of a tiger- repellent rock, but it goes over his head. Scott Anthony of the Harvard Business Review describes this scene as a \\"classic example\\" of the informal fallacy of assuming that correlation implies causation. Mike Moffatt also called it \\"the best all-time discussion of faulty reasoning\\".

Content The song is an extended reference to a famed 1870 race down the Mississippi River between two steamboats, the Robert E. Lee and the Natchez. It imagines a fictional steamboat, the Whippoorwill, captained by \\"Mr. Steamboat Bill,\\" given orders to beat the record of the Robert E. Lee. A gambler from Louisville, Kentucky (home of the Kentucky Derby) places a bet against Bill that the Whippoorwill will be unable to beat the record. Bill's obsession with speed causes the steam engine to explode, killing them both. The final verses imagine Bill and the gambler ascending to heaven, and his wife seeking out a new husband. Analysis A 1965 article in the Journal of American Folklore refers to it as a \\"pseudo-Negro\\" song and a parody of \\"The Ballad of Casey Jones\\". More recently, R. John Brockmann has called into question the time period the song is set in, pointing out that boiler explosions had not been considered an issue for steamboat captains since the 1880s. Brockmann suggests that the song recalls memories of the mid-19th century when such explosions were common. Recordings Arthur Collins, a ragtime singer, sang for the first recording in 1911. The song was a longtime hit in Tin Pan Alley and was covered as late as 1951, by the Delmore Brothers. Cultural impact Bolstered by the Buster Keaton and Mickey Mouse references, the song created lasting interest in steamboats and showboats. At least one showboat was actually named after the fictional Whippoorwill. This boat met a disastrous fate when it was hit by the 1978 Whippoorwill tornado, killing 16 passengers and crew.

His work on condensed detachment (inspired by the work of ≈Åukasiewicz) is influential in modern research. Biography Born 28 July 1904 into a distinguished Dublin family, he was the son of barrister Arthur Francis Carew Meredith K.C., whose opinions were sought by √âamon de Valera in drafting the constitution of the Irish Republic (1919‚Äì22). Educated in England at Winchester College, he went on to read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1922 becoming the first mathematical student to take a double first and 'B star' in two years. > ≈Åukasiewicz was appointed professor at the Royal Irish Academy, where he > lectured on mathematical logic. Meredith attended these lectures from 1947 > on, and became keenly interested in the Lukasiewicz's detachment operation, > for which‚Äîas he himself once phrased it‚Äîhe \\"seemed to have some aptitude.\\" Meredith was related to another mathematician, Thomas Meredith. He was a nephew of Richard Edmund Meredith and a cousin of Monk Gibbon, Judge James Creed Meredith and Ralph Creed Meredith. His old school friend from Winchester, William Empson, described him as \\"a small, gnomelike figure with a grin like a Cheshire cat and a pronounced Dublin accent (good for reading aloud from Joyce)\\". > He did logic whenever time and opportunity presented themselves, and he did > it on whatever materials came to hand: in a pub, his favored pint of porter > within reach, he would use the inside of cigarette packs to write proofs for > logical colleagues. Work He proved the shortest known axiomatic bases for a number of logic systems, such as this one-axiom basis for propositional calculus: ( ( ( ( ( \\\\phi \\\\to \\\\psi ) \\\\to ( eg \\\\chi \\\\to eg \\\\theta ) ) \\\\to \\\\chi ) \\\\to \\\\tau ) \\\\to ( ( \\\\tau \\\\to \\\\phi ) \\\\to ( \\\\theta \\\\to \\\\phi ) ) ) His achievements in that area were unsurpassed until automated theorem provers in the last few years, which build on his work, proved some shorter ones for some systems and proved his shortest for others. Notably, Stephen Wolfram, William McCune and others built on Meredith's work to produce the shortest known single axiom equivalent to the axioms of propositional calculus.History of logic axioms Stephen Wolfram, A New Kind of Science, 2002, p. 1175.

The community is named after a small island of the same name located offshore from nearby Cape Spencer. According to local oral history, the island, cape and community trace their name to a man named Spencer who is buried on the island. However the name more likely comes from Lord Spencer, a British statesman at the time the community was settled.C. Bruce Fergusson, \\"Spencer's Island\\", Place-Names and Places of Nova Scotia Nova Scotia Archives (1967), p. 638. Spencer's Island was used seasonally by the Mi'kmaq who called it Wochuk, meaning small kettle island. The first recorded settlement was by the Spicer families in 1778. Spencer's Island became an important shipbuilding centre during the latter days of the Age of Sail. The first large vessel from its shipyards was the Amazon built in 1861 and later to become famous as the Mary Celeste. Many larger vessels followed including the full-rigged ship Glooscap in 1891, the largest ship built in Cumberland County and the last square rigger built along the Parrsboro Shore.Stanley Spicer Sails of Fundy: The Schooners and Square- riggers of the Parrsboro Shore (Hantsport, NS: Lancelot Press, 1984), p. 15. The former shipyard area is now part of the Old Shipyard Beach Campground. The community is located at 45¬∫21'16\\"N, 64¬∫42'54\\"W, with the community of Advocate Harbour to the west and the community of Port Greville and village of Parrsboro to the east. It is located on Route 209 and one of the communities that form the Fundy Shore Ecotour.Fundy Shore Ecotour The community of Spencer's Island contains a historic lighthouse dating to 1904, a beach, campground and cafe. The lighthouse has recently been granted permission by the Canadian Coast Guard to turn the light back on, and is open to the public with pictures of the ship building and ship building artifacts on display. A plaque in the lighthouse recognizes Stanley Spicer, a noted local historian who helped save the lighthouses and wrote many books on the history and shipping of the Bay of Fundy. A picnic park is located beside the lighthouse and a public boat ramp has also been re-built for small craft to be launched from mid-tide to high tide. Public bathrooms are available from June to September.

He has worked as a band member, session musician, sideman, and leader of his own ensembles. He is the older brother of the drummers John Wackerman and Brooks Wackerman. Musical career Wackerman was raised in Seal Beach, California, in a family immersed in music. His father Chuck Wackerman, a drummer, is a music teacher who has taught at both high school and middle school levels with a specialization in jazz. Chad and his brothers John and Brooks are all proficient drummers and multi-instrumentalists. John recorded an album titled Drum Duets Vol.1. Wackerman joined the Bill Watrous band in 1978, and then worked with Frank Zappa from 1981 to 1988. Zappa demanded high musical standards and imposed exacting discipline in rehearsal and on tour. The auditions for his band were \\"gruelling\\", according to Steve Vai and Wackerman himself. Two pieces of music, \\"Mo 'n Herb's Vacation\\", and \\"The Black Page\\" were considered exceptionally difficult. Only three drummers throughout Zappa's career were able to play them successfully: Wackerman, Terry Bozzio, and Vinnie Colaiuta. In addition to appearing on Zappa's rock albums and tours, Wackerman performed with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1983 on a concert and recording session of Zappa's compositions. Sideman and session musician Wackerman (center) with Allan Holdsworth and Jimmy Johnson in 2006 In 1985, Wackerman toured with, but did not record for, Australian rock act Men at Work. He played on the album and supporting video One Voice with Barbra Streisand. He has also recorded albums and toured with diverse artists such as Allan Holdsworth, Steve Vai, Andy Summers, Ed Mann, Albert Lee, Colin Hay, Dweezil Zappa and Tom Grant. Wackerman was also the drummer for the house band on the first Dennis Miller late night talk show. Wackerman has also toured with James Taylor, Mark Linn-Baker and Larry Sweeney, John Patitucci, Jeff Lorber, and Joe Sample, as well as fellow Zappa drummer Terry Bozzio in a series of all-percussion concerts. Wackerman lived in Australia for ten years between 1995 and 2005, but moved back to California in July 2005. Replacing drummer Marco Minnemann, Wackerman toured with Steven Wilson's band through 2013 in support of Wilson's album The Raven That Refused to Sing.

It is a recollection of Paulo's experiences as he made his way across northern Spain on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. The novel serves as part adventure story, part guide to self-discovery. Plot summary The story begins in 1986 when Coelho undertakes his initiation into the order Regnus Agnus Mundi (RAM), which he subsequently fails. He is then told that he must embark on a pilgrimage along the Camino de Santiago to find the sword that is the symbol of his acceptance into the ranks of RAM. He must do this to gain insight into the simplicity of life. The journey transforms him as he learns to understand the nature of truth through the simplicity of life. He begins his journey with a guide, also a member of RAM, who goes by the alias Petrus. During the journey Petrus shows him meditation exercises and introduces him to some of the more down-to-earth elements of Western mystical thought and philosophy, and teaches him about love and its forms: agape, philia and eros.

Wardell (born June 24, 1971) is an American businessman, programmer, author and AI Engineer. He is the founder, President, and CEO of Stardock, a software development and computer games company. Wardell's specialty is the design and programming of artificial intelligence and game mechanics for turn-based strategy games. CEO of Stardock =Early career= Wardell built PCs and worked as a check proofer while studying at Western Michigan University. He graduated in 1994 with a degree in Electronic Engineering, specializing in Computer Engineering. Wardell was involved in the design and implementation of Galactic Civilizations for OS/2, one of the platform's few games. He led development of OS/2 Essentials, followed by Object Desktop, a package of utilities and desktop enhancements. = Windows development = When the OS/2 market collapsed, he shifted Stardock to Windows, heading development of PC game Entrepreneur (now The Corporate Machine) while coordinating the creation of WindowBlinds and other Object Desktop components. Wardell designed Galactic Civilizations for Windows and its sequel, which became GameSpy's Game of the Year. He subsequently designed The Political Machine and Elemental, as well as two expansions (Dark Avatar and Twilight of the Arnor) to Galactic Civilizations II. In 2012 he was the producer of Elemental: Fallen Enchantress. In mid 2013, Stardock announced that it had promoted Derek Paxton to succeed Wardell in the running of Stardock Entertainment in order for Wardell to have more time for other projects.http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/09/09/interview-with-the-new-head-of- games-at-stardock-derek-paxton/ These other projects included co-founding new game studios including Oxide Games and Mohawk Games with Soren Johnson. =Computer customization= Wardell is co-founder and webmaster of WinCustomize, a site specializing in the distribution of skins and themes for computer software. He is also an administrator and ‚Äì through Stardock ‚Äì the largest single shareholder of technology news site Neowin. He was a regular on the PowerUser.TV podcast, run by WinCustomize and Neowin, and organized the GUI Olympics (later GUI Championships), a semi-annual skinning competition starting in 2002. =Video games= Wardell is regularly interviewed by game industry magazine Gamasutra. In 2009, he was chosen as a judge for Intel's \\"Level Up\\" game demo contest. He was also a columnist for game websites The Adrenaline Vault and Quarter to Three. Wardell takes an approach to game development allowing users to view and influence the process of making games. Wardell is credited with multiple game projects either as a game designer or as an executive producer. In 2013, he and Soren Johnson cofounded Mohawk Games to develop strategy games. Their first video game was Offworld Trading Company.

The book is set a thousand years after the Cataclysm, after the time of the game itself, and involves the quest of a former messenger to save mankind from the Fallen. The book came with a coupon to download an exclusive campaign for the game. Views =Digital rights management= Wardell endorses digital distribution, despite the potential for piracy. He believes that while copyright infringement is an issue, blaming it for poor sales ‚Äì and insisting on \\"stupid\\" forms of digital rights management ‚Äì \\"hides other underlying causes.\\" Indeed, he argues that extreme anti-piracy measures result in poor sales: > The reason why we don't put copy protection on our games isn't because we're > nice guys. We do it because the people who actually buy games don't like to > mess with it. Our customers make the rules, not the pirates. Wardell says any system of protection \\"should be completely invisible to the user,\\" and that it is not enough to make a good product while disrespecting your customers: > Stardock is consumer friendly because we're a bunch of greedy capitalists > who have recognized what should be an obvious truth: If you treat people as > potential customers and not potential criminals you are likely to get more > sales. To this end, Wardell created a \\"Gamers Bill of Rights,\\" released at PAX 2008. Gas Powered Games' Chris Taylor ‚Äì who was working with Stardock on Demigod at the time ‚Äì called the bill \\"an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to.\\" =Media bias= Wardell has commented on the Gamergate controversy, stating that \\"The media should acknowledge that there's a problem and that their customers are getting fed up with it\\" in response to a question about how the media should cover it.

In specific contexts, e.g., in qualification for some event, it may refer to dancers up to a particular age such as 18. It also may refer to a style of dancing that, while most popular among younger dancers, can be enjoyed by some older dancers. Square dancing is an activity open to people of almost every age group, but many people think of it as an activity for people in their late fifties or older; in this context even people in their thirties or forties may be considered \\"young\\" dancers. But among those involved with the full age range of current dancers, early twenties is usually the upper limit for designating a group or event with the term \\"youth\\". Clubs for youth dancers Youth square dancing, as a style, is typically open to all square dancers. The dancing is generally modern western square dancing, as it is practiced throughout the world, standardized by Callerlab. Square dance clubs vary in their accommodation of young dancers, ranging from clubs organized specifically for youth, through ones that are populated by dancers of every age, to some that are oriented exclusively to adults. Some representative categories of square dance clubs and classes with respect to age: *Those for children in a specific age range (e.g., 5-8, pre-teens, teens) *Those for children and their parents or other family members *Those that encourage dancers of all ages *Those primarily oriented to adults but that allow children *Those that do not allow children Distinctive features of youth square dancing There are a number of ways in which youth square dancing differs from typical adult square dancing. These features are typical in clubs that are oriented specifically toward youth dancing, and also tend to be more common, even among adults, at mixed-age clubs and events where there are a significant number of youth dancers. =Energy level= Youth dancing tends to be \\"higher energy\\". The dancing tends to be faster, with the caller using faster and more modern music. (Youth square dancing shares this characteristic with gay square dancing.) =Styling= While all modern Western square dancing uses a common set of call definitions, which specify the basic dance movements and outcome of each call, there are many possible \\"frills\\" or \\"flourishes\\" -- extra movements that can be added without changing the resulting position. These include extra twirls, kicks, and other movements of the hands or feet. A few of these are traditional among adult dancers in certain geographic regions, but youth dancing generally includes more of them regardless of location. (Youth square dancing shares this characteristic with gay square dancing.) =Gender roles= Gender is an essential aspect of square dance choreography. Each square consists of four \\"boys\\" (or \\"gentlemen\\") and four \\"girls\\" (or \\"ladies\\"), who maintain this identity throughout a dance tip. The caller uses this to address calls to a subset of the dancers. In addition, a relatively small number of calls, but ones that are commonly used, involve a different dance action for the boys and girls. However, for this to work it is not necessary that the biological sex of the dancers match the roles that they are playing at any given time, e.g., it is possible for a woman to dance the \\"boy's part\\". At the typical adult club, dancing the \\"opposite part\\" is relatively uncommon. Many clubs are dominated by married couples, most of the dancers are not familiar with dancing the other part, and there may even be social stigma associated with such role reversals. Sometimes it is accepted, but is seen only as a way to deal with special circumstances, such as to accommodate everybody when there are \\"extra\\" women. In youth dancing, switching gender roles is perhaps a little more common as a variation. It might occur because a girl does not have a partner, usually due to a shortage of boys, but wants to dance. So she partners with another girl. It's very unusual for a boy to dance the girl's part. A girl might dance the boy's part one tip, and the girl's part the next. Some youth dancers know how to dance both parts, having learned this either for the additional challenge or out of necessity to have more flexibility in squaring up with the available dancers. (Dancing opposite roles is characteristic in challenge-level square dancing.) Gay people also dance opposite roles, naturally. =Partners= At some adult square dance clubs (called couples clubs) and events, dancers may be expected to come with a partner, and dance mostly--in some cases exclusively-- with that partner. Although such clubs may are becoming increasingly rare as the square dance population ages and couples are split by death or divorce, they may still be found. Other clubs allow both couples and singles as members; in these, it is common for couples to dance the first and last tip together, but take other partners throughout the dance. In youth square dancing, it is very common for dancers to have a new partner for each tip, and in some cases this is accomplished by dancers simply joining squares as individuals with other dancers then coming along to be their partners, rather than by any sort of pre-arrangement. Thus, at most clubs with a significant number of youth dancers, there is no requirement that dancers come with a partner and individual dancers are easily accommodated. (Youth square dancing shares this characteristic with gay square dancing and challenge-level square dancing.) =Learning style= In general, younger people learn more quickly than older people, and so on average clubs with younger dancers teach a given dance program in a shorter period of time. Some groups teach youth the basics in short-format classes such as a one-week day camp or a one day \\"blast\\" class. At some clubs, teens have been known to learn the calls by being \\"pulled through\\" sequences by their more experienced friends.

A regional service centre for southern Cumberland County, the community is also known for its port on the Minas Basin, the Ship's Company Theatre productions, and the Fundy Geological Museum. History Before the arrival of European settlers, Parrsboro was a portage point for Mikmaq travellers along the Minas Basin and Cumberland County river systems. The native inhabitants called the region \\"Awokum,\\" meaning a 'short-cut' or 'passing-over point.' The first European settlers were the Acadians in 1670 at the western mouth of the Parrsboro Harbour, near Partridge Island. After they were expelled in 1755, they were replaced by New England Planters. The centre of settlement gradually shifted from Partridge Island to the sheltered estuary of the Parrsboro River where a harbour and surrounding mills grew. The settlement, at first named Mill Village, was renamed Parrsboro in honour of Nova Scotia Governor John Parr in 1784, and the town was incorporated on July 15, 1889. The Town Hall and Civic Gardens Parrsboro thrived in the mid 19th century as the hub of a string of shipbuilding communities from Economy to Advocate collectively known as the \\"Parrsboro Shore\\". The town became a port of registry in 1850 for over 115 locally built schooners as well as giant square riggers, culminating in the largest, the ship Glooscap in 1891. In its peak years of the 1890s, over 1646 ships arrived and departed annually.Stanley Spicer Sails of Fundy: The Schooners and Square-riggers of the Parrsboro Shore (Hantsport, NS: Lancelot Press, 1984), p.15 The Springhill and Parrsboro Railway began service to the town from the coal mining town of Springhill on July 1, 1877; Parrsboro became a coal shipping port for the Springhill mines, primarily serving Saint John, New Brunswick. Railway service to Parrsboro was abandoned on June 14, 1958, following several years of declining shipments, several months before the 1958 mining disaster. Throughout the late 19th century and first four decades of the twentieth century, Parrsboro saw daily ferry service across the Minas Basin to the Annapolis Valley ports of Kingsport and Wolfville. The 13th and final vessel in this service, operated by the Dominion Atlantic Railway, was the MV Kipawo, which is now permanently beached at Parrsboro and incorporated into the Ship's Company Theatre performance centre. A Handley Page V/1500 named Atlantic made a forced landing in Parrsboro July 5, 1919. When the starboard engine failed the pilot, Major Brackley saw the lights of the town during the night and landed. After three months, the aircraft was repaired and departed for Greenport, New York, Parrsboro's sister town. The local Air Cadet Squadron, 689 Handley Page, is named after this event. On April 10, 1984, Parrsboro resident Eldon George located the world's smallest dinosaur footprints at Wasson Bluff, a series of cliffs to the east of Parrsboro Harbour. The prints are now on display at the Parrsboro Rock and Mineral Shop and Museum, owned by George. Municipal governance Parrsboro was incorporated as a town on July 15, 1889. On October 5, 2015 the Town Council filed an application for dissolution with the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. The NSURB held public hearings in November 2015 and issued a decision on June 15, 2016 granting the application. The Town of Parrsboro was dissolved effective November 1, 2016 and merged into the larger Municipality of the County of Cumberland.  Climate  Area features As with much of rural Nova Scotia, the primary industry in Parrsboro is tourism. The community is known for its seasonal theatre productions, fossil and rock hounding attractions, museums, high tides and heritage buildings. The cliffs along the Minas Basin to the east and west of Parrsboro contain fossils of prehistoric animals and plants. Many fossils are on display in local museums. Of the three museums in Parrsboro, two are dedicated to geological history. The Fundy Geological Museum, located along the eastern shore of Parrsboro Harbour, and the Parrsboro Rock and Mineral Shop and Museum, along the western shore, display many unearthed discoveries and provide information on the history of the region's landscape. The former post office, armoury and customs house (1913) has been converted into a space for artistic and cultural activities and hosts residencies from artists,writers,academics,dancers musicians etc. There is an art gallery on the 2nd floor , a used book shop on the ground floor with a vegetarian cafe. The residency program can host as many as 20 with private rooms and work spaces. (http://www.hmsnonesuch.com. The Wave house (1887) and the former united church(1896 on Queen street are also used in the residency program The third museum is the Ottawa House. It was built 1775 but contains evidence of Acadian construction as well as several additions. Located along the western coast of Parrsboro Harbour, near Partridge Island, it occupies the original town site and is near the legendary landing site of Henry Sinclair, 1397, and the factual site of Samuel de Champlain, 1607. It was the summer home of Father of Confederation Sir Charles Tupper, 1860s, and was named in honour of Canada's Capital. A major focus is Parrsboro's shipbuilding history and the museum has many artifacts that date from the Age of Sail. A three-storey clock tower is a prominent feature of Parrsboro's Main St. The tower is part of a big, red-brick government building that was partially opened in 1913 and completed the following year.Centennial Book Committee (1988, 2001). Heritage Homes and History of Parrsboro. Dartmouth: Print Atlantic. The building housed an armoury that conducted military training during both World Wars, a post office, a customs house and a weather station. The federal government sold it to private interests in 1973 when the post office moved to another location. The building stood empty for decades, but was acquired in 2011 by Harvey Lev, a Montreal businessman with interests in heritage real estate. After extensive renovations, Lev and his partner, Judith Bauer, opened a centre called Main & Station in the spring of 2013. It provides spaces for a variety of activities including art exhibits, conferences, workshops, poetry readings and a caf√©. A cultural and community centre, known locally as The Hall, has been a prominent feature of community life for more than a century. It is located in a former Presbyterian Church at 44 King St. that dates from 1884. The Town of Parrsboro purchased the building in 1942 and used it for school purposes. It served as a school auditorium and music room as well as a space for household and vocational training. The extensively renovated building is now run by the Parrsboro Band Association. It features concert performances by the Parrsboro Citizens' Band, one of the oldest such citizens' bands in Canada. Professional musicians also perform at The Hall and there are frequent community \\"Open Mic\\" nights. Films are regularly shown in its movie theatre and it provides space for community meetings, theatre rehearsals and fundraising events. Other community features include local churches, a public library, a primary and secondary school, and a 50-watt radio station, Parrsboro Community Radio, heard at 99.1 FM. Economy Tourism is the town's main industry. Although Parrsboro has a flourishing tourism industry and several small businesses, the community - common to many maritime communities faces economic challenges. The decline of wooden shipbuilding in the late 19th century dealt a severe blow to the local economy, along with neighbouring communities such as Port Greville and Shulie. The community also suffered from the depletion of local forests and the closing of the Springhill coal mines which ended coal shipments and railway service. A further blow was felt from highway route changes in the late 1950s as part of the Trans-Canada Highway project; Highway 2 was the primary highway from Truro to Amherst until the upgrading (and new construction) of Highway 4 through the Wentworth Valley to form the present-day expressway Highway 104. These changes contributed to an economic decline in Parrsboro in the latter half of the 20th century after some businesses, such as the O'Regans garage and car dealership, moved to larger population centres.\\"About Us\\" O'Regans Car Dealership Parrsboro blueberry fieldsA number of businesses have remained consistent and sustainable in Parrsboro, owing to the community's central location along the north shore of the Minas Basin. There is a number of small coastal fishing operations in the area and the community is also the base of operations for several large blueberry harvesting companies, as well as being home to Parrsboro Metal Fabricators, a firm which has found a successfully niche in producing home heating oil tanks for export. Small businesses in or near Parrsboro include the Crossroads Co-op supermarket, a Tim Hortons franchise, a Home Hardware, an Irving Oil gas station, a convenience store, an art gallery called The Destination Gallery, a nine-hole golf course, a skating arena, a bottle depot, and a restaurant/tavern. There are many seasonal accommodations businesses in the Parrsboro area to serve the tourism industry, which primarily operates during the summer and fall seasons. In 2006, Headz Gamez, a British Columbia-based board game manufacturer, announced that it was relocating 1,500 manufacturing jobs from its facilities in China to Parrsboro. Promises of manufacturing facilities, employee housing and recreation facilities were made; however, the project was cancelled later that year after the CEO sold off his personal company stock and resigned his position.

He is best known for being the creator of early games from several different genres, including pioneering simulation game Utopia for Intellivision in 1981, role-playing game Dungeon in 1975, sports games including the first interactive computer baseball game Baseball in 1971, and the first graphical MMORPG, Neverwinter Nights in 1991. He founded long-standing game developer Stormfront Studios in 1988. In 2008 Daglow was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for Neverwinter Nights pioneering role in MMORPG development. Along with John Carmack of id Software and Mike Morhaime of Blizzard Entertainment, Daglow is one of only three game developers to accept awards at both the Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards and at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards. In 2003 he was the recipient of the CGE Achievement Award for \\"groundbreaking accomplishments that shaped the Video Game Industry.\\" University mainframe games in the 1970s In 1971 Daglow was studying playwriting at Pomona College in Claremont, California. A computer terminal connected to the Claremont Colleges PDP-10 mainframe computer was set up in his dorm, and he saw this as a new form of writing. Like Kelton Flinn, another prolific game designer of the 1970s, his nine years of computer access as a student, grad student and grad school instructor throughout the 1970s gave him time to build a large body of major titles. Unlike Daglow and Flinn, most college students in the early 1970s lost all access to computers when they graduated, since home computers had not yet been invented. Some of Daglow's titles were distributed to universities by the DECUS program-sharing organization, earning popularity in the free-play era of 1970s college gaming. His best known games and experiments of this era include: * Baseball (1971) ‚Äî A member of Society for American Baseball Research, Daglow created the first interactive computer baseball game,Game Design Workshop: Designing, Prototyping, & Playtesting Games - Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, Steven Hoffman - Google Books.

It appeared ten years after John Burgeson wrote the first baseball simulation game, on an IBM 1620 at an IBM lab in Akron, Ohio. Daglow continued to expand Baseball throughout the 1970s, and ported the game to the Apple II in 1981, adding graphics in 1982. The simulation model in the Apple version in turn was ported to the Intellivision in 1982 as the basis for Intellivision World Series Baseball. * Star Trek (1972) ‚Äî One of several popular Star Trek computer games widely played in American colleges during this era, along with Star Trek (1971). Daglow's game was \\"the #2 Star Trek at most schools\\", garnering him fan mail after it was distributed through DECUS. The game printed out dialogue of characters on the Enterprise, describing the events of a battle with an enemy spaceship. The player could enter in choices, such as moving the Enterprise or firing phasers, and the game would advance accordingly until one of the ships surrendered, fled, or was destroyed. * Ecala (1973) ‚Äî Improved version of the ELIZA computer conversation program. This project paved the way for his later work by suggesting new kinds of game interfaces. * Dungeon (1975) ‚Äî The first computer role playing game, based on the then-new Dungeons & Dragons gaming system. The game was steadily expanded over the following five years. * Spanish Translator (1977) ‚Äî As he experimented with parsers he created a context-sensitive Spanish translation program. * Killer Shrews (1978) ‚Äî A simulation game based on the cult sci-fi film The Killer Shrews. The player has not many decisions to make, only when to try to escape the island during the simulation of the depleting of the food that is there. * Educational Dungeon (1979) ‚Äî An attempt to make rote computer-aided instruction (CAI) programs more interesting by taking Dungeon and making correct answers propel the story. Intellivision and Electronic Arts in the 1980s In 1980 Daglow was hired as one of the original five in-house Intellivision programmers at Mattel during the first console wars.Olsen, Jennifer (July 2001). \\"Profiles: Don Daglow‚Äîbreaking typecasts\\", Game Developer 8 (7): 18.

Utopia was a surprise hit and received wide press coverage for its unique design in an arcade-dominated era. The game has been named to two different video game halls of fame. * Intellivision World Series Baseball (1983) ‚Äî the first video game to use multiple camera angles to display the action rather than a static playfield; developed with Eddie Dombrower. As the team grew into what in 1982 became known as the Blue Sky Rangers Daglow was promoted to be Director of Intellivision Game Development, where he created the original designs for a number of Mattel titles in 1982-83 that were enhanced and expanded by other programmers, including: * Tron Deadly Discs (programmed by Steve Sents) * Shark! Shark! (programmed by Ji-Wen Tsao) * Buzz Bombers (programmed by Michael Breen) * Pinball (programmed by Minh-Chau Tran). During the Video Game Crash of 1983 Daglow was recruited to join Electronic Arts by founder Trip Hawkins, where he joined the EA producer team of Joe Ybarra and Stewart Bonn. His EA titles include: * Realm of Impossibility (1984) * Adventure Construction Set (1985) * Racing Destruction Set (1985) * Mail Order Monsters (1985) * Thomas M. Disch's Amnesia (1986) * Lords of Conquest (1986) * World Tour Golf (1986) * Super Boulder Dash (1986) * Ultimate Wizard (1986) * Earl Weaver Baseball (1987) -- again teamed with Eddie Dombrower. One of the earliest EA Sports titles, EWB was later named to the computer game Hall of Fame by Computer Gaming World and GameSpy. CGW named it as one of the top 25 games of all time in 1996. * Patton Versus Rommel (1987) * Return to Atlantis (1987) In addition to Dombrower, at EA, Daglow often worked with former members of the Intellivision team, including programmer Rick Koenig, artist Connie Goldman and musician Dave Warhol. Daglow spent 1987‚Äì88 at Br√∏derbund as head of the company's Entertainment and Education Division. Although he supervised the creation of games like Jordan Mechner's Prince of Persia, Star Wars, the Ancient Art of War series, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, his role was executive rather than creative. He took a lead role in signing the original distribution deal for SimCity with Maxis, and acquired the Star Wars license for Br√∏derbund from LucasFilm. Stormfront Studios in the 1990s and 2000s Looking to return to hands-on game development, Daglow founded game developer Stormfront Studios in 1988 in San Rafael, California. Between 1988 and 1995 Daglow designed or co-designed the following titles: * Tony La Russa Baseball (1991‚Äì1997) ‚Äî with Michael Breen, Mark Buchignani, David Bunnett and Hudson Piehl, winner of multiple Game of the Year awards from Computer Gaming World and other publications. * Quantum Space (1989‚Äì1991) ‚Äî The first original play by email game offered by a major online service * Gateway to the Savage Frontier (1991) ‚Äî A Gold Box Dungeons and Dragons RPG for SSI, went to #1 on the U.S. game charts. * Rebel Space (1992‚Äì1993) ‚Äî with Mark Buchignani, David Bunnett and Hudson Piehl. * Treasures of the Savage Frontier (1992) ‚Äî Gold Box D&D; RPG for SSI, the first game where an NPC could fall in love with a player character. * Neverwinter Nights (1991‚Äì1997) ‚Äî The first graphical MMORPG, with programmer Cathryn Mataga, and the top revenue producing title in the first ten years of online games. NWN paved the way for Ultima Online (1997), EverQuest (1999), and World of Warcraft (2004). * Stronghold (1993) ‚Äî The first 3D RTS game, with Mark Buchignani and David Bunnett * Old Time Baseball (1995) ‚Äî a baseball sim with over 12,000 players and 100 years of teams. By 1995 Stormfront had placed on the Inc. 500 list of fast-growing companies three times and Daglow stepped back from his design role to focus on the CEO position. See the article on Stormfront Studios for further information. In 2003 and again in 2007 Daglow was elected to the Board of Directors of the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. He also serves on the San Francisco Advisory Board of the IGDA, the Advisory Board to the President of the Academy of Art University and served on the Advisory Board to the Games Convention Developers Conference until it was dissolved in 2008. In 2009, Daglow joined the board of GDC Europe.Game Developers Conference  2009 GDC Europe Announces Advisory Board. Gdconf.com (2009-04-08). Retrieved on 2014-05-22. He has been a keynote speaker, lecturer and panelist at game development conferences in Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. Fiction During the late 1970s Daglow worked as a teacher and graduate school instructor while pursuing his writing career. He was a winner of the National Endowment for the Humanities New Voices playwriting competition in 1975. His 1979 novelette The Blessing of La Llorona appeared in the April, 1982 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine.

It is situated next to the Trent River, across the harbour from Comox and lies on the southeast municipal boundary of Courtenay. It has a population of just over 1500. History Royston was the major port for the Comox Valley logging industry throughout the 20th century. Logs were shipped here by rail, boomed in the harbour, then towed across to the B.C. Mainland to be made into lumber. William Roy and his family settled the area in 1890, collaborating with a real estate promoter named Frederick Warren to lay out a townsite that they named Royston. The settlement could have been named as \\"Roy's Town\\" but could also have been named after Warren's home town of Royston in Hertfordshire - or both. Early settler William Roy was one of the first to clear land in Royston. Originally from Scotland, William came from Westville, Nova Scotia arriving in the Comox district in 1890. Although he was bound for Cumberland, on the ship that brought him up from Nanaimo he met James Dunsmuir. Dunsmuir owned large tracts of land and invited Roy to look around for an area he might like to buy. Roy decided on beach property that would now straddle both sides of Royston Road on the east side of the Island Highway and north of the Trent River. Roy with a real estate promoter named Frederick Warren created village lots in 1910. By 1912 Royston had 30 settlers. A rail line between Royston and Cumberland provided easy daily travel between the two settlements from 1914 to 1930. This service lead several Cumberland residents to build summer homes at Royston and Gartley beach on the south side of the Trent River. Squatters moved into the area between Gartley beach and Millard Creek (now part of Courtenay) during the hard times of the 1912-1914 Cumberland mine workers strike. Royston Imperial Pavilion was built in 1918 and covered in 1925. There was one single and four double tennis courts on the Royston waterfront that hosted numerous community events. As the orchestra warmed up for a summer evening dance in 1940 an electrical fire broke out bringing the pavilion to the ground in minutes, never to be replaced. The Royston Community Club purchased the machine shop at the corner of the Island Highway and Royston Road in 1952 for a community hall. The building is now nearly 100 years old having been constructed in 1925. Waterfront Oil Tanks & Wharf Shell and Imperial Oil took over the government wharf in 1940. The Royston wharf handled a heavy tonnage in oil products through the years. Initially barrels of oil were rolled to shore on the wharf. Fuel was later pumped from barges to tanks on the Royston waterfront. Oil tanks were located on the northwest corner of Royston Road and Marine Drive from 1916 until 1997. The wharf head was 12m x 30m (40 x 100 ft) with an approach that was just 1.1 m (3.6 ft) wide but 400m (1,320 ft) long. The viewing stand at the end of Royston Road is built with timbers and decking from the wharf which was removed in 2003. References History of Royston. by Jean Feely and Margery Corrigall.

A weighhouse or weighing house is a public building at or within which goods are weighed. Most of these buildings were built before 1800, prior to the establishment of international standards for weights. As public control of the weight of goods was very important, they were run by local authorities who would also use them for the levying of taxes on goods transported through or sold within the city. Therefore, weigh houses would often be near a market square or town centre. Between 1550 and about 1690 people accused of witchcraft were at times brought to a weigh house in order to be subjected to a \\"witch test\\" to \\"prove\\" their innocence for payment (as nobody was deemed to be a witch after this test). If a person was found to be lighter than a set weight, he or she was deemed guilty. This is similar to the use of a ducking stool. Weigh houses were especially common in the Netherlands, Germany, where they are called waag and waage respectively (both meaning \\"scale\\") and Poland (waga miejska, \\"town/city scales\\", as in Krak√≥w and Pozna≈Ñ). Outside the Netherlands and Germany the public weighing usually didn't take place in a special building, but in a town hall, guild hall, courthouse, or the like. Netherlands =Alkmaar= One of the very few remaining weigh houses still in use is the one in Alkmaar, Netherlands, where the Cheese Market still includes the weighing of the cheeses as a demonstration for tourists. = Amsterdam = The Waag in Amsterdam The Amsterdam Waag is a remnant of the former city walls in Amsterdam. Constructed in 1488, it was originally one of the city gates, the Sint Anthoniespoort. When the city expanded, the Nieuwmarkt (new market) was created around it and the weighing scales for the market were placed in the former gate. Today the building houses the Waag Society, an ICT research foundation working in the social and cultural domain, and there is a caf√©/restaurant on the ground floor. The building carries the oldest plaque in Amsterdam, which reads On 28 April 1488 the first stone of this gate was laid. The city walls that the Sint Anthoniespoort was part of were built in the years 1481-1494. These walls have now completely disappeared and the only remnants are this gate, the lower part of another gate, the Regulierspoort (now the Munttoren) and one defence tower, the Schreierstoren. When in the late 16th century the city expanded the wall was torn down and the gate lost its function. The defensive canal and palissade around the gate was turned into a market square. In the process the ground level was raised, so the building is no longer quite as high as it used to be. For the new weighing function the original front and rear gate were connected with a roof. The upper floors housed four guilds for some time, namely those of the smiths, painters, masons and surgeons. Each guild had its own entrance tower. In 1632 Rembrandt van Rijn was commissioned to paint the surgeons at work, and the resulting The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp made his reputation. In 1691 a theatrum anatomicum was added, which became famous for admitting (paying) members of the public to witness human dissections. After the guilds were dissolved around 1795 the building served numerous purposes, later housing a fire brigade and two museums (including the Jewish Historical Museum) before it was handed over to a foundation in 1990. This had plans to partly destroy the building and build an addition designed by Philippe Starck, but the foundation went bankrupt before any plans were carried out. The neighbourhood and monument lovers convinced the Amsterdam city council that the building deserved a better fate. It was decided to restore it in keeping with its medieval background. Waag Society became the principal tenant in 1996. = Other cities = A number of other Dutch towns also have a weigh house, including Delft, Deventer (with museum), Edam, Enkhuizen, Gouda, Haarlem, Hoorn, Langweer, Leeuwarden, Leiden, Nijmegen, Oudewater (Heksenwaag = witches' weighing house), Vlaardingen and Zaltbommel. Pieter Post, a Golden Age architect, had his weigh house design chosen for two cities; Gouda, and Leiden: File:Prinsegracht Den Haag 024.JPGBoterwaag Den Haag File:Gouda waaggebouw februari 2003.jpgKaaswaag Gouda File:20140531 Waag Leeuwarden NL.jpgWaag Leeuwarden File:Waag Leiden.jpgWaag Leiden Image:De Waag Gouda.jpgRelief showing the weighing process (Gouda) Image:Zaltbommel,_monumentaal_bedrijfspand_Sieraad%26Kado_foto4_2011-05-30_17.26.jpgFacade of the weigh house in Zaltbommel (built 1796-1798) Belgium Some cities in Belgium still have a Stadswaag, like Kortrijk. File:Stadswaag Kortrijk 2.jpgStadswaag Kortrijk  France  Almost every village had a public weight.

On July 7, 2008 a 15-km length of the coast constituting the Joggins Fossil Cliffs was officially inscribed on the World Heritage List.UNESCO portal History The area was known to the Mi'kmaq as \\"Chegoggins\\" meaning place of the large fish weir, a name modified by French and English settlers to Joggins. Situated on the Cumberland Basin, a sub-basin of the Bay of Fundy, Joggins was a long established coal mining area. Its coal seams which are exposed along the shore of the Cumberland Basin were exploited as early as 1686 by local Acadian settlers and by the British garrison at Annapolis Royal in 1715. Satellite view of the upper Bay of Fundy region, showing Joggins Cliffs and community of Joggins at centre right. The first commercial mine was set up by Major Henry Cope in 1731, but was destroyed by the Mi'kmaq in November 1732. Samuel McCully opened a mine in 1819 with much of his production being shipped by sea to Saint John, New Brunswick and other markets, but went out of business in 1821 having mined less than 600 tons.FALCON-LANG, H.J. 2009. The earliest history of coal mining and grindstone quarrying at Joggins, Nova Scotia and its implications for the meaning of the place-name \\"Joggins\\". Atlantic Geology 45: 1-21. Large-scale industrialization came to Cumberland County under the General Mining Association, which held the rights to the area's coal fields. Commencing at Joggins in 1847, production increased after the construction of the Intercolonial Railway in the 1870s, followed by the 1887 opening of the Joggins Railway, a 12-mile rail line from mines at Joggins to the Intercolonial mainline at Maccan, through River Hebert. Old coal mine working are eroding out of the sea-cliffs at Joggins. Recently dendrochronology had been employed to date the timber pit props. A late nineteenth century age has been inferred, with most props dating from the 1860s and 1870s.QUANN, S., YOUNG, A., LAROQUE, C., FALCON-LANG, H.J. & GIBLING, M.R. 2010. Dendrochronologic dating of coal mine workings at the famous Joggins Fossil Cliffs of Nova Scotia, Canada. Atlantic Geology, 46, 185-194. The coal mines attracted a diverse number of workers, some as young as 12 years. French- speaking Acadians returned from New Brunswick, and were joined by Irish and Scottish immigrants. Joggins Mines expanded rapidly to include three churches, two cemeteries, a hotel, a roller ring, movie theater, fire department, general store, post office, railway station and school. Coal mining grew in such importance that the community was incorporated as a town in 1919, a status that it maintained until 1949, when the decline of local coal mines resulted in out migration and economic decline. Coal mined at Joggins during the first decades of the 20th century primarily fed two electrical generating stations near Maccan, however these plants were outdated by the 1950s and the mines closed shortly after the Springhill Mining Disaster in 1958. Rail service was abandoned to the community in the early 1960s. The Joggins area was well known in the 19th and early 20th century for the quarrying of limestone grinding wheels, lumber, fishing and dairy production. The Bay of Fundy also boosts a rich tradition of shipbuilding. In the 1800s, wooden coastal schooners were built on the shore to carry coal and mill stones to the United States. Several of the older homes in the Joggins area display the sturdy, practical, yet handsome woodworking of craftsmen trained in shipbuilding. Many of the beaches along the Bay of Fundy are still littered with stone ballast from the hulls of old ships. Today in addition to tourism, the area is known for the commercial cultivation of wild blueberries and agricultural food processing. The roads and bridges to Joggins were improved in the 1980s and 1990s and area has become popular for tourism, summer homes and retirees. Joggins is a destination on the Nova Scotia Economic and Rural Development and Tourism Glooscap Trail, a spectacular twisting drive of soaring cliffs and deep valleys along the Bay of Fundy. Mi'kmaq legend tells of the a mythical transformer, Glooscap, who created Nova Scotia and controlled the great tides with his magical powers. The Bay of Fundy has the highest tides in the world. Visitors can walk on the ocean floor at low tide, or go rafting on the tidal bore. The high tides have shaped the landscape into one of singular beauty; pristine beaches, dramatic rock outcrops, sea cliffs, waterfalls, and rugged forests. The Joggins area is ecologically diverse and rich in wildlife. Eagles, osprey, and moose are common sights. In the fall the area is popular with birdwatchers; the rich marshes, originally diked by the Acadians in the 1600s, attract hundreds of thousands of migrating birds. Joggins has been known for its fossils since the early 19th century. The fossils are found in the exposed Pennsylvanian coal seams in the cliffs that overlook the shore. The fossils consist mainly of ferns, prehistoric trees and early sea life. The daily high tide erodes the cliff, the stone fossils fall out of the coal and are left on the shore when the tide recedes. Fossils have also been found in the area deep shaft mines and in drilling core samples hundreds of feet down. Joggins is one of the easiest places in the world to find early Pennsylvanian coal fossils. In 2008, the Joggins Fossil Cliffs were designated as a UNESCO natural heritage site. The Joggins Fossil Centre is the museum built on the fossil cliff to display the fossils. Exhibits include the geological history of the Joggins Cliffs, the history of scientific discovery at Joggins, and how area coal mining affected the community. Interpretive tours of the cliffs are offered. The Centre is open seasonally. Joggins Fossil Cliffs An upright tree preserved in the cliffs at Joggins, Nova Scotia Joggins is famous for its record of fossils from a rainforest ecosystem approximately 310 million years ago, dating to the Pennsylvanian \\"Coal Age\\" during the Late Carboniferous Period.FALCON-LANG, H.J., GIBLING, M.R. & GREY, M. 2010. Classic localities explained 4: Joggins, Nova Scotia. Geology Today 26 (3): 108-114. The dramatic coastal exposure of the Carboniferous (also known as Coal Age) rocks, known as the Joggins Fossil Cliffs, are continually hewn and freshly exposed by the actions of the tides in the Cumberland Basin. Geologists were first attracted to this locality in the late 1820s with Abraham Gesner, Richard Brown, Thomas Jackson and Francis Alger all making important observations.FALCON-LANG, H.J. 2006. A history of research at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs, the world's finest Pennsylvanian section. Proceedings of the Geologists' Association 117 (3) : 377-392. A little later, a party from Williams College, Massachusetts became the first student party to study Joggins for educational reasons in 1835.FALCON-LANG, H.J. 2009. The 1835 Williams College expedition to Atlantic Canada: The first geological fieldtrip by a North American college. Atlantic Geology 45: 95‚Äì109. However, the true fame of Joggins dates to the mid-nineteenth century and the visits in 1842 and 1852 by Charles Lyell, the founder of modern geology and author of Principles of Geology. In his Elements of Geology (1871), Lyell proclaimed the Joggins exposure of Coal Age rocks and fossils to be \\"the finest example in the world\\".Joggins Fossil Cliffs website The fossil record at Joggins figures in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and played a role in the Great Oxford Debate of 1860 between Bishop Wilberforce and Thomas Huxley. Much of the early work to document the fossil record at Joggins was by Nova Scotian geologist Sir William Dawson (1820‚Äì1899), who had a close personal and working relationship with his friend and mentor Charles Lyell. Much of Dawson's collection resides at the Redpath Museum of McGill University. Other notable nineteenth century geologists who worked at Joggins include Abraham Gesner, inventor of kerosene, and William Logan, who measured the cliffs bed by bed for the Geological Survey of Canada. Imprint of a fossilized root found near the cliffs at Joggins, Nova Scotia.In 1852 Lyell and Dawson made a celebrated discovery of tetrapod fossils entombed within an upright tree at Coal Mine Point. Subsequent investigations by Dawson led to the discovery of one of the most important fossils in the history of science, Hylonomus lyelli, which remains the earliest known sauropsid (reptile) in the history of life, but not oldest known amniote, the group that includes all vertebrates that can reproduce out of water.There are earlier amniotes (such as Westlothiana) which predate the split between synapsids and sauropsids. In 2002, Hylonomus lyelli was named the provincial fossil of Nova Scotia. Another vital early tetrapod fossil has been found here, the earliest synapsid, Protoclepsydrops, which is actually earlier than Hylonomus.Benton M.J. and Donoghue P.C.J. 2006. Palaeontological evidence to date the tree of life. Molecular biology and evolution. 24(1): 26‚Äì53. p39 Other organisms found at the Joggins site include members of the calamites family, lepidodendron, sigillaria, ferns, various early amphibian species, numerous fish species (including evidence of coelacanths) and a variety of arthropod species. In addition to individual fossils, the Joggins Fossil Cliffs is of interest because it represents a time in Earth's history when a tropical rainforest covered Nova Scotia. Slightly more recent fossil finds indicate that these rainforests collapsed quickly, triggering a mass extinction event, the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse. Trackways made by the giant arthropod arthropleura are preserved at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs. The tree-like lycopodiophyte Sigillaria is famously preserved in situ at Joggins. Recent geologic and paleontologic work There has been a surge in interest in Joggins over the past two decades. Recent geologic work has been primarily coordinated by Martin Gibling, Professor of Sedimentology at Dalhousie University.Falcon-Lang, H. J., 2006, A history of research at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs, the world's finest Pennsylvanian section, Proceedings of the Geologists' Association 117 (3) : 377-392. Amateur fossil collectors have also made major contributions to our knowledge. For example, Don Reid, a long-time resident of Joggins, donated his entire collection of Joggins fossils to the Joggins Fossil Institute. Many of his specimens are on display in the Joggins Fossil Centre. In 2009, palaeontologist Melissa Grey was hired as the first scientific curator for the Joggins Fossil Institute (JFI).http://jogginsfossilcliffs.net/institute/chart/Melissa.php . The Joggins Fossil Institute continues to conduct and foster research at the site http://jogginsfossilcliffs.net/research/Recentresearch.php . and hosts international paleontologists and geologists and conference field-trips. JFI also has a Science Advisory Committee comprising scientists from Maritime universities and government departments. This is a volunteer committee whose mission is to: provide expert and comprehensive advice and support to the JFI on scientific matters respecting the development, conservation and management of the Joggins Fossil Cliffs property, the content of the Joggins Fossil Centre's programs, scientific research related to the fossil cliffs, and scientific issues arising from the site's status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Committee also assists in reporting on the status of monitoring programs and state of conservation of the Joggins Fossil Cliffs property. World Heritage Site In 2007, a 14.7-km length of the coast constituting the Joggins Fossil Cliffs was nominated by Canada to UNESCO as a natural World Heritage Site. It was officially inscribed on the World Heritage List in on July 7, 2008. Gallery File:Joggins-bark.jpgPlant fossil with Canadian one dollar coin (26.5mm) for scale.

Sheemish is a freshly carved idol added to the same temple one day‚Äîand from that moment the two deities become jealous, taunt each other and attempt to outdo the other in achieving miracles. Eventually their combined efforts result in a minor earthquake which destroys the temple. Their worshippers each claim their preferred god has caused the earthquake, but all of them stay away and do not rebuild the temple out of fear of such powerful gods. The narrator remarks that he found the demolished, abandoned temple one day and that Sheemish had been smashed but Chu-bu was intact, found on his back with his hands and feet in the air.

It is a modernized version of William Shakespeare's Macbeth. The film stars James LeGros, Maura Tierney, and Christopher Walken. Shakespeare's tragedy, originally set in Dunsinane Castle in 11th century Scotland, is reworked into a dark comedy set in 1975, centered on \\"Duncan's Cafe\\", a fast-food restaurant in the small town of Scotland, Pennsylvania. The choice of Pennsylvania is arbitrary, though it coincides with two real towns, one southwest of Harrisburg on the outskirts of Chambersburg called Scotland and one just south of Erie, called Edinboro after Scotland's Edinburgh. The film was shot in Nova Scotia. The title is a reference to The Scottish Play. Plot In 1975, Duncan's, a fast-food restaurant owned by Norm Duncan in the tiny hamlet of Scotland, Pennsylvania, hosts a variety of workers. Joe ‚ÄúMac‚Äù McBeth is passed over for a promotion to manager by Douglas McKenna, who has been embezzling the restaurant's money. Three stoned hippies, one a fortune teller, inform Mac that they see a bank drive-thru style restaurant in his future as management. Mac and his wife Pat then play informants on McKenna, and Duncan recognizes the value of Mac's efforts on behalf of the restaurant. Duncan shares with the McBeths his plans to turn his failing burger joint into a drive-through, and Mac realizes how profitable the drive-through could be, after which he is hit in the head with a refrigerator door and passes out briefly. Pat then decides to murder Duncan in a staged robbery. Mac and Pat attack Duncan to acquire the combination to the restaurant's safe, and Mac assaults Duncan, but is distracted by a vision of the three hippies, allowing Duncan to fall head first into a deep fryer that splatters and burns Pat's hand. Investigator McDuff arrests a local homeless man, to whom Pat has given Duncan's jewelry, and the restaurant is willed to Duncan's eldest son, Malcolm. Malcolm sells the restaurant to the McBeths who immediately realize Mac's ideas, and the restaurant's business takes off. Investigator McDuff returns to Scotland, where the homeless man is cleared, and the McBeths focus their attention on Malcolm. Banko, Mac's friend, questions why Mac had never mentioned the drive- thru concept. Mac grows withdrawn and paranoid and on a hunting trip contemplates killing off Banko, but a vision of the three hippies dressed as deer distracts him. Pat becomes obsessed with her burn injury and accuses people of staring at her repulsive-looking hand, though no scar is visible. Mac then kills Banko with the homeless man's gun, and the body is discovered while new celebrity Mac gives a press conference. Mac calls on an hallucination of Banko to ask a question at the press conference and loses his sanity as the town watches on TV. He then returns to the woods to look for the hippies while Pat becomes deluded into thinking her hand is falling off. Mac then completely loses his sanity, answering and talking on the phone when no one is on the other end. In one conversation, the hippies suggest he kill McDuff's family. Mac grabs the sheriff's gun and orders the officer to call McDuff to the restaurant, where he then shoots McDuff, but the gun proves to be empty. They then wrestle for the inspector's gun on the roof of the restaurant and both fall off. Mac is impaled on the horns of his car. Pat self-medicates with alcohol, but then cuts her hand off and bleeds to death. McDuff takes over the restaurant, fulfilling his dream of working with food.

Format These two ads show the Dialing for Dollars format in 1972-73 on two sister stations, KXMB-TV in Bismarck/Mandan, N.D. and KXMC-TV in Minot, N.D. They illustrate how local stations used their own talent and set design to create a Dialing for Dollars series. The program's usual format had the host, a local television personality, announce a certain password to the audience at the beginning of the program (on most stations, \\"the count and the amount\\"). He would then randomly select a phone number to call from a bowl or drum, either from those that had been previously submitted by viewers, or by scraps of paper cut from residential telephone directories. Viewers watching the show would know that they were being called, answer the phone with the correct password, and would win a monetary prize. If the viewer did not respond correctly or failed to answer the call altogether, the prize money would continue to increase. \\"The count\\" consisted of a number (1 through 9) and direction (up/down or top/bottom), randomly selected at the beginning of the show, that served to determine which number would be called. Slips were cut from pages of the viewing area's telephone book(s), each containing several numbers; at each playing, one slip was drawn and the appropriate number was selected. If the count was \\"6 Down,\\" for example, the sixth number down from the top of the slip was called. \\"The amount\\" was the value of the cash prize at stake. Dialing for Dollars originated as a radio program in 1939 on WCBM in Baltimore, Maryland, hosted by Homer Todd. With the advent and rise of commercial television broadcasting in the U.S. during the late 1940s and 1950s, the format switched to television and was franchised nationally as a popular, low-budget way to fill local market airtime, especially in the late mornings. On some stations (such as KTVU hosted by Pat McCormick, who also did voices for the Charley & Humphry puppets during a local cartoon show), the Dialing for Dollars format would be used during the local telecasting of a morning or afternoon movie. The film would be interrupted by a dialing for dollars segment every so often, rather than going to a commercial break, after which the program either went to a commercial or directly back to the film. On others, such as WKBW's version and WTNH's version, both versions are variety shows complete with studio audience and mini-games, The difference between both stations is that WTNH's version also contains special guests and performances after dialing games or mini-games. However, WKBW's version runs for an entire hour, and WTNH's version runs for 30 minutes as normal. By the mid-1970s, the popularity faded for the Dialing for Dollars format, as competition developed from daytime talk shows, and more sophisticated game shows coming from syndication. Another factor in the show's decline was the trend of fewer households having stay-at-home members available to answer the phone during the day. Dialing for Dollars left the Baltimore airwaves in 1977 (although it is still seen in a few markets), after giving away $800,000 locally in its 38-year run there on radio and television.Scott Shane, \\"Television host Stu Kerr dies\\", Baltimore Sun, July 18, 1994. Broadway producer Lee Guber attempted to resurrect the concept on a national basis in 1987, meeting with Canadian broadcaster Peter Emmerson with regards to hosting what would have emanated from the former GFG Productions facilities in Brooklyn. The project was never completed due to Guber's illness which was diagnosed soon after; he died of a brain tumor on March 27, 1988. The program has also been satirized on the Canadian sketch comedy series SCTV. Live with Kelly and Ryan carries on the tradition with its daily Travel Trivia contest, and a few local shows directly trace their lineage to Dialing for Dollars (an example is AM Buffalo). The program was also referenced in Janis Joplin's classic hit song \\"Mercedes Benz\\" from the 1970 album \\"Pearl\\". More recently, cable network Adult Swim has periodically revived the concept beginning in mid-2018 for their online livestream; due to the original concept being rendered obsolete by the advancement of technology, instead viewers of the livestream must memorize a certain word (indicated by the onscreen appearance of a plane marked \\"SPY\\"). Viewers that enter their phone number into the Adult Swim website can then have a chance to be picked to win a prize of some sort if they are picked during the drawing (which is broadcast Thursdays at 9PM on the livestream) and say the correct word.

It has a population of 6,076. Names The name comes from the name of the river Hnilec derived from Slavic word hnil√Ω (rotten). The initial g in the German form G√∂llnitz indicates that the name was adopted by Germans before the spirantisation of Slavic g to h in the Slovak language (around the 12th century). The current Slovak name Gelnica comes from this secondary German form. The Hungarian G√∂lnicb√°nya (b√°nya ‚Äì mine) refers to the town's mining activity. Geography It is located in the northern part of the Slovak Ore Mountains, in the Hnilec river valley, which flows a few kilometres downstream into Horn√°d. The town lies at the both banks of Hnilec, has an altitude of , and is located around from Ko≈°ice. History Carpathian Germans chiefly from Bavaria began to settle the formerly Slavic settlement during the 13th century. By 1264 it was an established mining town and became a royal mining town of the Kingdom of Hungary by 1276, from where the first mentioned is recorded (as \\"Gelnic\\"). For many years Gelnica was a chief mining town in the Spi≈° region of Slovakia. Silver, copper, but also gold, quicksilver, lead and iron ore were mined in the mines. Between 1465‚Äì1520, Gelnica lost most of its privileges. The town's population in the second half of the 16th century is estimated at 1000 people, whereby the ratio of Germans and Slovaks, who were the main ethnic groups, is estimated to have been 3:1.Martin ≈†tef√°nik ‚Äì J√°n Lukaƒçka et al. 2010, Lexik√≥n stredovek√Ωch miest na Slovensku, Historick√Ω √∫stav SAV, Bratislava, 2010, p. 156, . http://forumhistoriae.sk/-/lexikon- stredovekych-miest-na-slovensku The German population was expelled in 1945. Sights The town includes the ruins of a medieval castle, destroyed by a fire in 1685. Other attractions include a Gothic church and Renaissance town hall, both remodelled along Baroque lines, and a mining museum. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 6,404 inhabitants. 95.92% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.55% Roma, 0.84% Germans and 1.02% Czechs. The religious makeup was 72.00% Roman Catholics, 15.88% people with no religious affiliation, and 4.03% Lutherans and 3.28 Greek Catholics.

Rogge; Acta Materialia, Volume 53, Issue 12, July 2005, Pages 3517-3524 First reported by Guillaume Piobert and W. L√ºders, the mechanism that stimulates their appearance is known as \\"dynamic strain aging,\\" or the inhibition of dislocation motion by interstitial atoms (in steels, typically carbon and nitrogen), around which \\"atmospheres\\" or \\"zones\\" naturally congregate. Figure 1: Measured strain distribution of a tensile test (shape memory alloy) during loading and unloading shows moving L√ºders bands. The measurement was performed with a LIMESS Digital image correlation system. As internal stresses tend to be highest at the shoulders of tensile test specimens, band formation is favored in those areas. However, the formation of L√ºders bands depends primarily on the microscopic (i.e. average grain size and crystal structure, if applicable) and macroscopic geometries of the material. For example, a tensile-tested steel bar with a square cross-section tends to develop comparatively more bands than would a bar of identical composition having a circular cross-section.Macroscopic aspects of L√ºders band deformation in mild steel V.S. Ananthan‚Ä†, and E.O. Hall; Acta Metallurgica et Materialia, Volume 39, Issue 12, December 1991, Pages 3153-3160 The formation of a L√ºders band is preceded by a yield point and a drop in the flow stress. Then the band appears as a localized event of a single band between plastically deformed and undeformed material that moves with the constant cross head velocity. The L√ºders Band usually starts at one end of the specimen and propagates toward the other end.Mesarovic, Sinisa(1995) ‚ÄúDynamic Strain Aging and Plastic Instabilities.‚Äù Mech. Phys. Solids 43:671-700 The visible front on the material usually makes a well-defined angle typically 50‚Äì55¬∞ from the specimen axis as it moves down the sample.Ananthakrishna, G. (2007)‚ÄúCurrent theoretical approaches to the collective behaviour of dislocations‚Äù. Physics Reports 440:113-259 During the propagation of the band the nominal stress‚Äìstrain curve is flat. After the band has passed through the material the deformation proceeds uniformly with positive strain hardening. Sometimes L√ºders band transition into the Portevin‚ÄìLe Chatelier effect while changing the temperature or strain rate, this implies these are related phenomena L√ºders bands are known as a strain softening instability. If a sample is stretched beyond the range of the L√ºder strain once, no L√ºder strain occurs any more when the sample is deformed again, since the dislocations have already torn themselves away from the interstitial atoms. For this reason, deep drawing sheets are often cold rolled in advance to prevent the formation of stretcher- strain marks during the actual deep drawing process. The formation of L√ºder bands can occur again with a deformation over time, since the interstitial atoms accumulate by diffusing processes called precipitation hardening (or aging).

It catalyzes formation and degradation of a significant allosteric regulator, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) from substrate fructose-6-phosphate. Fru-2,6-P2 contributes to the rate-determining step of glycolysis as it activates enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 in the glycolysis pathway, and inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 in gluconeogenesis. Since Fru-2,6-P2 differentially regulates glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, it can act as a key signal to switch between the opposing pathways. Because PFK-2 produces Fru-2,6-P2 in response to hormonal signaling, metabolism can be more sensitively and efficiently controlled to align with the organism's glycolytic needs.This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism. The enzyme is important in the regulation of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and is found in greatest quantities in the liver, kidney and heart. In mammals, several genes often encode different isoforms, each of which differs in its tissue distribution and enzymatic activity. The family described here bears a resemblance to the ATP-driven phospho-fructokinases, however, they share little sequence similarity, although a few residues seem key to their interaction with fructose 6-phosphate. PFK-2 is known as the \\"bifunctional enzyme\\" because of its notable structure: though both are located on one protein homodimer, its two domains act as independently functioning enzymes. One terminus serves as a kinase domain (for PFK-2) while the other terminus acts as a phosphatase domain (FBPase-2). In mammals, genetic mechanisms encode different PFK-2 isoforms to accommodate tissue specific needs. While general function remains the same, isoforms feature slight differences in enzymatic properties and are controlled by different methods of regulation; these differences are discussed below.  Structure  The monomers of the bifunctional protein are clearly divided into two functional domains. The kinase domain is located on the N-terminal. It consists of a central six- stranded Œ≤ sheet, with five parallel strands and an antiparallel edge strand, surrounded by seven Œ± helices. The domain contains nucleotide-binding fold (nbf) at the C-terminal end of the first Œ≤-strand. The PFK-2 domain appears to be closely related to the superfamily of mononucleotide binding proteins including adenylate cyclase. On the other hand, the phosphatase domain is located on the C-terminal. It resembles the family of proteins that include phosphoglycerate mutases and acid phosphatases. The domain has a mixed Œ±/ Œ≤ structure, with a six-stranded central Œ≤ sheet, plus an additional Œ±-helical subdomain that covers the presumed active site of the molecule. Finally, the N-terminal region modulates PFK-2 and FBPase2 activities, and stabilizes the dimer form of the enzyme. While this central catalytic core remains conserved in all forms of PFK-2, slight structural variations exist in isoforms as a result of different amino acid sequences or alternative splicing. With some minor exceptions, the size of PFK-2 enzymes is typically around 55 kDa. Researchers hypothesize that the unique bifunctional structure of this enzyme arose from a gene fusion event between a primordial bacterial PFK-1 and a primordial mutase/phosphatase.  Function  This enzyme's main function is to synthesize or degrade allosteric regulator Fru-2,6-P2 in response to glycolytic needs of the cell or organism, as depicted in the accompanying diagram.PFK-2 and FBPase-2 Reaction In enzymology, a 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: :ATP + beta-D-fructose 6-phosphate \\\\rightleftharpoons ADP + beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate Thus, the kinase domain hydrolyzes ATP to phosphorylate the carbon-2 of fructose-6-phosphate, producing Fru-2,6-P2 and ADP. A phosphohistidine intermediate is formed within the reaction. :At the other terminal, the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46) domain dephosphorylates Fru-2,6-P2 with the addition of water. This opposing chemical reaction is: :beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons D-fructose 6-phosphate + phosphate : Because of the enzyme's dual functions, it can be categorized into multiple families. Through categorization by the kinase reaction, this enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. On the other hand, the phosphatase reaction is characteristic of the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds.  Regulation  In almost all isoforms, PFK-2 undergoes covalent modification through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation based on the cell's hormonal signaling. Phosphorylation of a specific residue may prompt a shift that stabilizes either kinase or phosphatase domain function. This regulation signal thus controls whether F-2,6-P2 will be synthesized or degraded. Furthermore, the allosteric regulation of PFK2 is very similar to the regulation of PFK1. High levels of AMP or phosphate group signifies a low energy charge state and thus stimulates PFK2. On the other hand, a high concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate(PEP) and citrate signifies that there is a high level of biosynthetic precursor and hence inhibits PFK2. Unlike PFK1, PFK2 is not affected by ATP concentration. #  Isozymes  Protein isozymes are enzymes that catalyze the same reaction but are encoded with different amino acid sequences and as such, display slight differences in protein characteristics. In humans, the four genes that encode phosphofructokinase 2 proteins include PFKFB-1, PFKFB2, PFKFB3 and PFKFB4. Multiple mammalian isoforms of the protein have been reported to date, difference rising by either the transcription of different enzymes or alternative splicing. While the structural core that catalyzes the PFK-2/FBPase-2 reaction is highly conserved across isoforms, the major differences arise from highly variable flanking sequences in the isoform amino and carboxyl terminals. Because these areas often contain phosphorylation sites, changes in amino acid composition or terminal length may result in vastly different enzyme kinetics and characteristics. Each variant differs in their primary tissue of expression, response to protein kinase regulation, and ratio of kinase/phosphatase domain activity. While multiple types of isozymes may consist in a tissue, isozymes are identified by their primary tissue expression and tissue of discovery below. = PFKB1: Liver, muscle, and fetal = Located on the X chromosome, this gene is the most well-known of the four genes particularly because it encodes the highly researched liver enzyme. Variable mRNA splicing of PFKB1 yields three different promoters (L, M and F) and therefore, three tissue-specific variants that differ in regulation: * L-Type: liver tissue  Insulin activates liver PFK-2 function to indicate a high abundance of blood glucose is available for glycolysis. Insulin activates a protein phosphatase which dephosphorylates the PFK-2 complex and causes favored PFK-2 activity. PFK-2 then increases production of F-2,6-P2. As this product allosterically activates PFK-1, it activates glycolysis and inhibits gluconeogenesis.  In contrast, glucagon increases FBPase-2 activity. At low blood glucose concentrations, glucagon triggers a cAMP signal cascade and in turn, Protein Kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates Serine 32 near the N-terminus. This inactivates the bifunctional enzyme's ability to act as a kinase and stabilizes the phosphatase activity. Therefore, glucagon decreases concentrations of F-2,6-P2, slows rates of glycolysis, and stimulates the gluconeogenesis pathway. Liver-Tissue PFK-2 Regulation: Concentrations of hormones glucagon and insulin activate proteins which change phosphorylation state of PFK-2. Depending on which domain is stabilized, PFK-2 will synthesize or degrade fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which impacts rates of glycolysis. * M-Type: skeletal muscle tissue; F-Type: fibroblast and fetal tissue  In contrast to most other PFK-2 tissues, PFK-2 in both skeletal muscle and fetal tissue is solely regulated by concentrations of Fructose-6-phosphate. Within their first exon, there are no regulatory sites that require phosphorylation/dephosphorylation to provoke a change in function. High concentrations of F-6-P will activate kinase function and increase rates of glycolysis, whereas low concentrations of F-6-P will stabilize phosphatase action. = PFKB2: Cardiac (H-Type) = The PFKB2 gene is located on chromosome 1. When greater concentrations of adrenaline and/or insulin hormone are circulated, a Protein Kinase A pathway is activated which phosphorylates either Serine 466 or Serine 483 in the C-terminus. Alternatively, Protein Kinase B may also phosphorylate these regulatory sites, which are part of the FBPase-2 domain. When this serine residue is phosphorylated, FBPase-2 function is inactivated and greater PFK-2 activity is stabilized. = PFKB3: Brain, placental, and inducible = PFKB3 is located on chromosome 10 and transcribes two major isoforms, inducible type and ubiquitous type. These forms differ in alternative splicing of Exon 15 in their C-terminus. However, they are similar in that for both, glucagon activates a cyclic AMP pathway; this results in Protein Kinase A, Protein Kinase C, or AMP-activated Protein Kinase phosphorylating a regulatory residue on Serine 461 in the C-terminus to stabilize PFK-2 kinase function. Furthermore, both isoforms transcribed from this gene are noted for having a particularly high, dominant rate of kinase activity as indicated by a kinase/phosphatase activity ratio of 700 (whereas the liver, heart, and testis isozymes respectively have PFK-2/FBPase-2 ratios of 1.5, 80, and 4). Therefore, PFKB3 in particular consistently produces large amounts of F-2,6-P2 and sustains high rates of glycolysis. * I-Type: Inducible  This isoform's name is a result of its increased expression in response to hypoxic stress; its formation is induced by lack of oxygen. This type is highly expressed in rapidly proliferating cells, especially tumor cells. * U-Type: Ubiquitous; also known as placental or brain   Though discovered separately in the placental, pancreatic-Œ≤-islet, or brain tissues, the various isoforms appear identical. The tissues it was discovered in all require great energy to function, which may explain PFKB3's advantage of such high kinase- phosphatase activity ratio.  The brain isoform in particular has lengthy N- and C-terminus regions such that this type is almost twice as large as the typical PFK-2, at around 110 kDa. i-PFKB3, Human inducible form * = PFKB4: Testis (T-Type) = Gene PFKB4, located on chromosome 3, expresses PFK-2 in human testis tissue. PFK-2 enzymes encoded by PFK-4 are comparable to the liver enzyme in size at around 54kDa, and like the muscle tissue, do not contain a protein kinase phosphorylation site. While less research has clarified regulation mechanisms for this isoform, studies have confirmed that modification from multiple transcription factors in the 5' flanking region regulates the amount of PFK-2 expression in developing testis tissue. This isoform has been particularly implicated as being modified and hyper-expressed for prostate cancer cell survival. 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase structure, testis tissue  Clinical significance  Because this enzyme family maintains rates of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, it presents great potential for therapeutic action for control of metabolism particularly in diabetes and cancer cells. Data also demonstrates that all of the PFK-2 genes (although the PFKB3 gene response remains the most drastic) were activated by limitations in oxygen.Minchenko, O., Opentanova, I., & Caro, J. (2003). Hypoxic regulation of the 6‚Äêphosphofructo‚Äê2‚Äêkinase/fructose‚Äê2, 6‚Äêbisphosphatase gene family (PFKFB‚Äê1‚Äì4) expression in vivo. FEBS Letters, 554(3), 264-270. The control of PFK-2/FBP-ase2 activity was found to be linked to heart functioning, particularly for ischemia, and the control against hypoxia. Researchers hypothesize that this responsive characteristic of the PFK-2 genes may be a strong, evolutionary physiological adaptation. However, many human cancer cell types (including leukemia, lung, breast, colon, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers) demonstrate over-expression of PFK3 and/or PFK4; this change in metabolism likely plays a role in the Warburg effect. Lastly, the Pfkfb2 gene encoding PFK2/FBPase2 protein is linked to the predisposition to schizophrenia.

It was the inspiration for the 1978 Japanese anime television series Future Boy Conan, directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Overview The Incredible Tide tells the story of Conan, a boy who lives alone on a small island on Earth ravaged by World War III. The world was knocked off its axis and the continents have sunk into the ocean, with only small islets remaining. Conan is rescued but finds that the new society is very different from the world he knew before. Backstory =The West= Conan, Lanna and Teacher are survivors of a land called the West, or the Western World, that now no longer exists, as a result of the cataclysmic destruction caused by the war. The West is described as having been a generally peaceful place. =The Peace Union= Although the reasons behind the war are not clear, a global superpower known as the Peace Union waged war against the West, finally using a doomsday weapon that destroyed their enemies, but destroyed themselves as well. The Peace Union does not exist anymore, but its leftover artifacts are everywhere. =The Change= The doomsday weapon that the Peace Union used was somehow magnetic in nature and caused a disruption in the Earth's core, causing massive worldwide earthquakes that changed the shape of land and sea alike. Huge tsunamis inundated all the world's coastlines; this was the \\"incredible tide\\" mentioned in the book's title. People now refer to this time as the Change. =The New Order= A group of people have recolonized a surviving Peace Union city, which they call Industria, and call themselves the New Order. They are trying to unite the survivors of the world under their banner and recreate the former civilization's technological glory. Of course, they consider themselves to be doing everyone a favor and expect everyone to be grateful and help them ... or else. =High Harbor= The Western survivors made their way to an island and created High Harbor, a place of refuge, where they live peacefully, but it is a hard life, without many technological comforts. Characters =Conan= Once Conan of Orme, a place in the West that no longer exists, Conan is 17 years old when the story begins. The incredible tide of the title caused the fleeing helicopter he was in to crash on its way to the island refuge that would become High Harbor, marooning him on a tiny island as the sole survivor, where he learned to survive on his own and has been living for five years. As a result of the hardship he has grown very strong. =Lanna= Lanna is described as a small, birdlike girl, and indeed she has several friends who are birds, including a tern named Tikki. She seems to have an empathic connection with birds that lets her communicate with them on a rudimentary level. She is a friend of Conan's who hasn't seen him since the cataclysm. Mazal is her aunt, Shann is her uncle, and Teacher is her grandfather. She has a deep-seated fear of the ocean since the tsunamis swept across the world. =Teacher= Teacher is a lean old man with a white beard and a mass of thick white hair who knows Conan and is the grandfather of Lanna. He is very wise, to the point of knowing how to communicate telepathically with Conan and Lanna's mother Mazal over great distances. His real name is Briac Roa, and he is in hiding because the leaders of the New Order want to find him and use his knowledge to recreate the technology that the old world used to have. =Mazal and Shann= Lanna's mother and father, they are the leaders of High Harbor. Mazal is Teacher's daughter and periodically receives telepathic messages from him, although she can't always make contact. Shann is a doctor. =Citizen Doctor Manski= A researcher who serves on a New Order exploration team, charting islands and searching for Briac Roa, Doctor Manski is totally committed to the New Order cause. She hates Westerners because a Westerner killed her son in the war, and thus she hates Conan too‚Äîbut she is so dedicated to the New Order that she wants to make sure his youth and strength are put to work for the New Order. =Commissioner Dyce= Dyce is a trader from the New Order, but he is more than that; he is also an agent of the New Order. He has come to High Harbor to take anything he can get his hands on that might help the New Order, and he is frustrated whenever he demands something that isn't in the trade agreements and Shann denies him. =Orlo= A rebellious teenager at High Harbor who has decided to break away from the rule of Mazal, Shann, and Teacher, and has begun drawing more teenagers and children to his cause. Unfortunately the rebellion seems to be mostly for rebellion's sake‚Äîhe's willing to steal food and even deal with the New Order to preserve his autonomy. Plot The story alternates between the experiences of Conan and Lanna. A New Order ship discovers the island where Conan has been surviving for five years since the helicopter crash and captures him, taking him back to the city of Industria as a worker. Meanwhile, Lanna and her parents at High Harbor have to deal with Dyce, who wants her people to supply lumber faster than they can with the tools they have and is desperate for knowledge of the whereabouts of Briac Roa. The New Order seems to be resurrecting only the worst of the fallen civilization's qualities, putting together a military-industrial complex without a culture or conscience. Without telling him what it will mean, they mark his forehead with a tattoo that designates him as an \\"apprentice citizen,\\" meaning that he will have to work to pay off the \\"debt\\" that he owes in gratitude for having \\"rescued\\" him. Enraged, he seizes the tattooing device and marks several self- important officials before he is subdued, and they assign him to work for a crazy old man named Patch, who turns out to be Teacher. Teacher has been hiding in Industria since the cataclysm, since it's the last place where the New Order would ever look for him, hiding his identity by acting like an insane, crippled old man. At High Harbor, Lanna and her parents are continuing to deal with Dyce and his demands‚Äînow he wants some wrecked aircraft that are on the island and some sassafras roots. Teacher has said that the New Order should by no means have those aircraft or the roots (the trees haven't yet multiplied to populations where there are enough to trade). Lanna finds out that they also have to deal with Orlo, who has been leading a rebellious tribe of children and teenagers that has broken away from the rest of High Harbor. Teacher, in the guise of Patch, is still an apprentice citizen despite having been in Industria for years, because he likes where he is: in a boat shop, building boats. No one else in Industria knows how to build them‚Äîthe city wasn't even on the coast before the Change. But Teacher has been planning to leave, and now that Conan is here, Teacher can put those plans into motion. Sickness breaks out at High Harbor, and Dyce is the only one who has any medicines. Lanna discovers that not only is Orlo trying to take over High Harbor, he's making deals with Dyce. Teacher discovers that there's going to be another earthquake, and this one will drop half of what remains of Industria into the sea. His humanitarian nature forces him to go to the Council and tell them who he really is so he can warn them, but he wants Conan to take the boat he's been building and wait for him at a designated rendezvous point. Meanwhile, a child has died from the illness at High Harbor, and Shann and Mazal agree to let Dyce have the aircraft in exchange for the medicine they need, although Shann thinks Dyce deliberately started the sickness as a bargaining chip. Conan waits for Teacher, but Teacher doesn't come. Realizing that Teacher is in trouble, he returns to Industria and rescues him, and they set sail for High Harbor, hoping that the searchers from Industria don't find them. They run deliberately into a storm as the only way to escape pursuit, but Teacher nearly drowns. Conan manages to get them to the island where he had survived for five years, and with Teacher's help he modifies their ship for the voyage to High Harbor‚Äîbut they will have to hurry, because they know that with the coming earthquake will also come a tsunami. To their surprise, they discover that Dr. Manski has also washed up on this island, because her survey ship was ordered to search for Briac Roa and went down in the same storm. They can't just leave her there with a tsunami on the way, and she has no choice but to go with them, but she still can't believe that he is Briac Roa or that such things as telepathy‚Äîor God‚Äîexist. Lanna despairs when Dyce entices more and more of the High Harbor people onto his trading vessel to show them the goods he has to trade‚Äîthings that people don't need but that he can entice them into believing they want. She wishes she could see the ship for herself, because it might give her a better idea what to do, but she doesn't dare go there for fear of looking as if she were herself endorsing Dyce and his goods. So she tries something that has worked for her in the past; she sends her tern Tikki to fly over the ship and attempts to see through his eyes. But this fails. Instead, she climbs to the highest point on the island and tells Tikki to find Conan and bring him safely to High Harbor. Teacher tells Dr. Manski about how Dyce had traded for the flying machines and their power cells for medicine to stop the sickness that had killed one child at High Harbor, and how he may in fact have spread the sickness in the first place. Manski thinks he's lying, because she doesn't trust how he gets his information and because he's an enemy of the New Order. But she begins to believe that he really is Briac Roa. Tikki makes it to their ship, but the fog has closed in, and they can't follow him because they can't see what direction he flies in. Lanna and her parents learn that Orlo and Dyce have a plan to take over their house and move in, throwing Shann and Mazal out but keeping Lanna around, presumably as a plaything for Orlo. They resolve that this will not happen without a fight and arm themselves. Teacher has warned Mazal about the coming tsunami, and she has warned Dyce to take his ship out to sea, but he doesn't believe her. Lanna tries once more to put her psyche into Tikki and help him lead Conan and Teacher home, and this time she succeeds. Conan, Teacher and Dr. Manski arrive at High Harbor right in the middle of the strife. Orlo and Dyce's faction immediately moves to seize Conan and Teacher, but Conan fights back and tells them to take shelter because there's a tsunami coming. Neither Dyce nor Orlo believe either Conan or Dr. Manski. Orlo captures Lanna, but lets her go when Conan challenges him directly, and Conan easily defeats him, awing his followers. Conan then uses the situation to get them all to seek higher ground, carrying the semi- conscious Orlo himself as the tsunami waters start to rush in. The story ends rather abruptly as it appears they will all make it to safety by working together. Influence on Hayao Miyazaki In 1978 Hayao Miyazaki directed a 26-episode series called Future Boy Conan, based on The Incredible Tide. The themes of living sustainably in harmony with nature rather than coercing it with technology, and of villains trying to recover the technology that nearly destroyed the world in the past, both recurred strongly in the first full- length film Miyazaki later wrote and directed, Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1984), and in the 1982-1994 manga of the same name by Miyazaki on which he partly based his film. Availability While the actual book has long been out-of-print, it recently became available again in digital form through Kindle.

In 1558, the village of Gatow became part of Spandau. Following the division of Berlin into four sectors at the end of the Second World War, Gatow became part of the British sector of West Berlin in early July 1945. Infrastructures The village church in Gatow Today's General-Steinhoff-Kaserne was between 1934 and 1994 home to an airfield, first used by the Luftwaffe as a staff and technical college, Luftkriegsschule II, and then by the Royal Air Force and Army Air Corps as RAF Gatow. RAF Gatow has the unlikely distinction of having been home during the Berlin Airlift to the only known operational use of flying boats within central Europe, when the RAF used Short Sunderlands to transport salt from Hamburg to Berlin, landing on the Havelsee lake. The airfield was handed back to the Luftwaffe on 7 September 1994 and was kept in use as an airfield for a very short time, being closed to air traffic in 1995. It is now called General-Steinhoff-Kaserne and is home to some non-flying Luftwaffe units, and the Luftwaffen Museum der Bundeswehr. This is the museum of the Luftwaffe which has many displays (including historic aircraft) and much information on German military aviation and the history of the airfield.

It is governed by the Pinellas County Schools. The school's mascot is \\"Wally the Warhawk\\". The student population is approximately 1,950. History Prior to the opening of the school in the late summer of 1962, students in what is now known as the Seminole area attended Largo High School or Dixie Hollins High School. With rapid growth in Seminole in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it became necessary for the newly suburban area to have its own high school. The original school consisted of what is now the main building where the administration offices are located and the front cafeteria. Seminole was the first high school in Pinellas County to be air-conditioned. The current \\"Warhawk\\" stadium was built in 1967 after a lengthy fundraising drive (Seminole Pow Wow). The auditorium, gymnasium and band facilities were built in later years. The school underwent a significant expansion in 1977 and an extensive remodeling in 1996. In the fall of 1973, the school used double sessions until the opening of Osceola High School in 1981.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 26, 1995. In the episode, Homer loses all his money in pumpkin stocks and must turn to Patty and Selma for a loan. Meanwhile, Bart takes up ballet lessons, and his instructor is voiced by actress Susan Sarandon. The episode was written by Brent Forrester and directed by Mark Kirkland, with David Mirkin serving as the executive producer. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on The Simpsons because her children were fans of the show; she made a later appearance in the series in the episode \\"Bart Has Two Mommies\\" as the voice of a computer. Mel Brooks also makes an appearance in \\"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\\", and had previously accompanied his wife Anne Bancroft to the recording studio when she had a role in the episode \\"Fear of Flying\\". Chris Turner cites scenes from the episode in describing Homer's characteristic qualities in his book Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation. Turner notes that the episode illustrates Homer's impulsiveness, silliness, and \\"physical stupidity\\". Contributor Raja Halwani writes in the compilation work The Simpsons and Philosophy that the episode shows Homer's tendency to habitually lie to Marge, and cites Homer's covering for Patty and Selma when they are caught smoking as a positive aspect of his character. The episode also received positive mention from Turner in Planet Simpson, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood in their book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, and Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide. Plot Homer invests in pumpkins, but loses his entire investment. Late on a mortgage payment, he tries to borrow money, to no avail. After Patty and Selma receive promotions at the DMV, Homer realizes they are his last resort. They agree to lend him money on the condition that he become their humble servant. Homer begs Patty and Selma to help conceal his money woes from Marge, who soon finds out after seeing his IOU note to her sisters. Homer becomes a chauffeur to earn more money, but is stopped by Chief Wiggum for not having a chauffeur's license. Homer visits the DMV with Marge to apply for one; Patty and Selma are his evaluators. The two mercilessly fail his driving and written test. To celebrate Homer's failure, they light up cigarettes but are caught by their supervisor, who threatens to demote them for smoking on the job. After seeing Marge's dismay at the situation, Homer reluctantly covers for them by claiming the lit cigarettes are his. To thank Homer for helping them avoid demotion, Patty and Selma forgive the loan. In the subplot, Bart is late for school on the day students choose their physical education classes. When he arrives, ballet is the only class that is available. Despite his initial reluctance, Bart soon discovers he is a talented dancer and is invited to star in a school ballet. After his performance, school bullies chase Bart, intending to beat him. He tries to escape by jumping over a trench but injures himself after failing the leap. Seeing that Bart is hurt from the fall, the bullies leave without pummeling him. Lisa tells Bart she is proud of him for showing his sensitive side. Production Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance in the episode. The script for \\"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\\" was written by Brent Forrester and was the first time he received a writing credit on The Simpsons.Mirkin, David (2005). Commentary for \\"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Executive producer David Mirkin describes it as a very grounded and emotional episode that seems very \\"sitcomy\\". Bart's ballet teacher was voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was designed to look a little bit like her. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them with her to the recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked very hard on getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode \\"Bart Has Two Mommies\\". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had played a role in the episode \\"Fear of Flying\\" and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. Mirkin realized that Brooks was \\"dying to do the show\\" and asked him if he would be willing to do a guest part, and he agreed. Many of the writers were fans of Brooks, and Matt Groening described the chance to have him guest star as \\"an incredible honor\\".Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for \\"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland who was a fan of the characters, having previously directed the season two episode \\"Principal Charming\\", which also focuses on the duo.Kirkland, Mark (2005). Commentary for \\"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. When directing the sequences where Bart does ballet dancing, Kirkland assigned the scenes to animators who were familiar with dancing. Themes Chris Turner writes in his book Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation that the episode illustrates how Homer Simpson is \\"an organism of considerable complexity\\". Turner comments, \\"Homer is carrying the full symbolic weight of twentieth-century America on his shoulders, and no garden-variety doofus could manage that task.\\" Turner discusses a moment from the episode where Marge tells her sisters, \\"Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man\\", after which Homer breaks a plate over his head and shouts \\"Wrong!\\" Turner writes that this \\"revelatory moment\\" is illustrative of \\"several of the best-known aspects of Homer's character: his impulsiveness, his inherent silliness, his evident, even physical stupidity\\". In the compilation work The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer, edited by William Irwin, Mark T. Conrad, and Aeon J. Skoble, the episode is cited as an example where, as contributor Raja Halwani writes, \\"Homer is a habitual liar, he lacks honesty.\\" In addition to \\"lying about his financial losses in investments\\" in the episode, Halwani notes Homer lied to Marge in \\"The Front\\" about \\"the fact that he never graduated from high school\\", and in the episode \\"The Cartridge Family\\", Homer lied to Marge about getting rid of the gun he had purchased. However, Halwani later highlights positive aspects of Homer's character, noting that in the episode, Homer \\"pretended he was the one smoking so that Patty and Selma would not get fired for smoking at their workplace\\". Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\\" finished 38th in ratings for the week of February 20‚Äì26, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 11.1, equivalent to approximately 10.6 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills, 90210 and Married... with Children. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that the scene where Homer \\"smashes a dinner plate over his head\\" is one of his favorite Homer moments. \\"I'd like to say it's the defining Homer moment, but that would do a grave injustice to the extraordinary dramatic achievement that is Homer J. Simpson\\", Turner comments. Writing in I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said, \\"Patty and Selma have rarely been more evil than here ‚Äî they are fabulously cruel.\\" In a review of the sixth season of The Simpsons, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes, \\"Homer‚Äôs disdain for Marge‚Äôs sisters ‚Äì and vice versa ‚Äì has always led to terrific sparks, and ‚ÄúVs.‚Äù provides another great round in their eternal battle. It's hilarious to see Homer indebted to the Terrible Two...\\" In Latin America, \\"Ni√±o Rata\\", the Spanish equivalent of \\"Ratboy\\" (the nickname Homer ascribes to Bart in a scene in this episode), became an internet meme, particularly on YouTube. The phrase is used to refer to irate, inexperienced and underage fans of such video games as Minecraft, Call of Duty, FIFA, Grand Theft Auto Online and Fortnite; it is also used to designate YouTube users who troll other users in the comments bar.

The city is situated on the slopes of Little Carpathians mountains and surrounded by typical terraced vineyards with more than 700 years of winemaking tradition. In 1990, the intact city center was declared a protected city reservation. Cadastrially, Sv√§t√Ω Jur includes also the natural reserve ≈†√∫r, established in 1952 to protect one of the last and largest remnants of a tall-stem swamp alder forest in Central Europe. Today, Sv√§t√Ω Jur has a population of over 5 thousand citizens. The town is well connected with a major road between Pezinok and Bratislava passing through and the Sv√§t√Ω Jur railway station situated on the main Ko≈°ice - Bratislava railway line. The city is bordered by the Little Carpathian mountains to the west, Bratislava to the south, natural reserve ≈†√∫r to the east and Limbach and Pezinok to the north and northeast respectively. Etymology The city name translates literally as Saint George, Jur being the archaic form of Juraj in the Slovak language. Between 1960 and 1990, the Communist government renamed the town to Jur pri Bratislave. Geography Sv√§t√Ω Jur is situated in the Pezinok District of the Bratislava Region in southwestern Slovakia. The surrounding areas include large vineyards in the nearby Little Carpathians and the unique ≈†√∫r swamps, a protected area. History Archaeological excavations date the original settlement to the Hallstatt period and the Quadi period. In the 9th century, a Great Moravian castle was built here. Sv√§t√Ω Jur was first mentioned in a written source in 1209 and received a town charter in 1299. It became a royal free town in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1647. Defensive city walls were constructed between 1603 and 1664, but Sv√§t√Ω Jur was devastated by the Ottoman Turks in their invasion of 1663. The Ottoman troops also destroyed the White Castle (), which had been an important administrative center of the region until then. In the 18th century, the Hungarian government recruited German farmers to repopulate the area. To encourage migration, it allowed the Germans to keep their language and religion in order to develop farmland for cultivation and produce. Through the 19th century and into the 20th century, the population of this area was largely ethnic German, although by that time they spoke an archaic form of German. They were known as Danube Swabians. In part because Nazi Germany used the eastern ethnic German communities as an excuse for its wars of expansion in eastern Europe, after World War II, ethnic Germans were forcefully expelled to Germany and other Western countries. In 1840, the first (horse) railway in the Kingdom of Hungary was built from Bratislava to Sv√§t√Ω Jur. Landmarks The most remarkable historical monument is the Gothic church of St. George, built in the 13th century. The sandstone altar from 1527 is an example of a transition between the Gothic and Renaissance styles. The stained glass windows were designed by Janko Alexy in 1950. The wooden bell tower from the 17th century protects a bell from 1400. The bell cracked due to a fire in 1802 and after repair in 1848 was damaged again. There is a fame that this bell was buried during the period of the Ottoman raids and was accidentally found by a rooting pig afterwards. A Great Moravian castle was built in the 9th century and it was abandoned in the 14th century. 1,693 metres of the walls have been preserved, but their height is now lower than the original 10 metres. Other places of interest include a Renaissance manor house, a Baroque church of Trinity, a Piarist monastery from 1720, a late 18th century synagogue and the ruins of the city walls. Sv√§t√Ω Jur is also well known for the largest raceway in Slovakia. Biely Kame≈à Castle Ruins of Biely Kame≈à Castle The castle of Biely Kame≈à was mentioned for the first time in 1217. It was the seat of the counts of Sv√§t√Ω Jur until 1609, when they moved to a more comfortable manor house in the town. The castle was partially destroyed by an Ottoman raid in 1663. The ruins are still visible. Population In 2006, Sv√§t√Ω Jur had a population of 5,186. According to the 2001 census, 97.5% of inhabitants were Slovaks. The Roman Catholicism is the most popular religion (72.5%), but there is also a significant number of atheists (15.9%) living in the village.http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html Municipal Statistics from the Statistical Office of the Slovak republic Sport The town has an association football team called ≈†K Sv√§t√Ω Jur.

She was married to Charlemagne in 770, in order for him to create a bond between Francia and the Kingdom of the Lombards and attempt to isolate his brother Carloman I who ruled over the central territories of Francia. The marriage lasted just one year and there are no known children from the marriage.  Marriage to Charlemagne  Desiderata was the second wife of Charlemagne, although there are some questions over the nature of Charlemagne's relationship to Himiltrude, his first wife. Carolingian historian Janet Nelson states that the marriage and resulting alliance with the Lombard's was directed against Carloman, leaving Charlemagne's brother encircled as a result. The marriage received opposition from Pope Stephen III, who in the summer of 770 wrote a letter to Charlemagne and Carloman voicing his discontent at the potential union between \\"the most notable race of the Franks and that fetid brood of the Lombard's that had brought leprosy into the land.\\" There is no mention of this marriage in the Royal Frankish Annals nor the revised version, however, it is mentioned briefly in chapter 18 of Einhard's Life of Charlemagne biography when he states that \\"at the urging of his mother he married a daughter of Desiderius.\\"  Debate surrounding her name  Although she is commonly referred to by the name Desiderata there is some debate surrounding her name. One school of thought is that the name derives from an editorial error in a 19th-century copy of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica which capitalized the 'D' in desideratam filiam (Latin for 'desired daughter'). Janet Nelson argues that it is far more likely that Desiderata's name is actually 'Gerperga.' Nelson provides multiple reasons as to why this is the case, firstly, the name fits in with the names of Desiderius' other daughters, all of which end in the suffix 'perga.' Secondly, Carloman's wife was called Gerberga, and this, Nelson believes, explains why when Gerberga fled to Desiderius after Carloman's death, the Annals of Lobbes believed that she was fleeing to her father, due to confusion over the similarities of their names. Additionally, in Pope Stephen III's letter to Charlemagne and Carloman, he is not sure of which brother is marrying Gerperga, Nelson argues that this confusion is also caused by the similarity in the names of Desiderius' Daughter and Carloman's wife.

The largest and best-known species, the so-called \\"giant amoeba\\" Chaos carolinense, can reach lengths of 5 mm, although most specimens fall between 1 and 3 mm. Members of the genus closely resemble those of genus Amoeba and share the same general morphology, producing numerous cylindrical pseudopods, each of which is rounded at the tip. However, while Amoeba have a single nucleus, Chaos can have as many as a thousand. Because of this attribute, C. carolinensis was once placed in the genus Pelomyxa alongside the giant multinucleate amoeba Pelomyxa palustris. Recently, molecular phylogenetic studies of this species have confirmed the view of some earlier researchers that it is more closely related to Amoeba than to Pelomyxa. The species is now placed in the independent genus Chaos, a sister group to Amoeba. Chaos carolinensis (=Pelomyxa carolinensis), as drawn by H.V. Wilson, 1900 Dietary habits Chaos species are versatile heterotrophs, able to feed on bacteria, algae, other protists, and even small multicellular invertebrates. Like all Amoebozoa, they take in food by phagocytosis, encircling food particles with its pseudopodia, then enclosing them within a food ball, or vacuole, where they are broken down by enzymes. The cell does not have a mouth or cytostome, nor is there any fixed site on the cell membrane at which phagocytosis normally occurs. Movement The cell's membrane, or plasmalemma, is extremely flexible, allowing the organism to change shape from one moment to the next. The cytoplasm within the membrane is conventionally described as having two parts: the internal fluid, or endoplasm, which contains loose granules and food vacuoles, as well as organelles such as nuclei and mitochondria; and a more viscous ectoplasm around the perimeter of the cell, which is relatively clear and contains no conspicuous granules. Like other lobose amoebae, Chaos move by extending pseudopodia. As a new pseudopod is extended, a variable zone of ectoplasm forms at the leading edge and a fountaining stream of endoplasm circulates within. The effort of describing these motions, and explaining how they result in the cell's forward movement, has generated a large body of scientific literature. Early history and naming controversy Amoebas and Volvox from R√∂sel von Rosenhof, 1755 Amoebas from C.G. Ehrenberg, 1830 The genus Chaos has had a long and often confusing history. In 1755, R√∂sel von Rosenhof saw and depicted an amoeboid he named \\"der kleine Proteus\\" (\\"the little Proteus\\").R√∂sel von Rosenhof, A.J. 1755. Der monatlich-herausgege benen Insecten-Belustigung erster [bis vierter] Theil... J.J. Fleischmann: N√ºrnberg. Vol. 3, Tab. 101, , p. 621, , p. 622, . Three years later, Linnaeus gave R√∂sel's creature the name Volvox chaos. However, because the name Volvox had already been applied to a genus of flagellate algae, he later changed it to Chaos chaos. In subsequent decades, as new names and species proliferated, accounts of Chaos, under a variety of synonyms, became so thoroughly entangled with descriptions of similar organisms, that it is virtually impossible to differentiate one historic amoeboid from another. In 1879, Joseph Leidy suggested collapsing all the \\"common\\" large, freshwater amoebae into one species, which he proposed to call Amoeba proteus. A dozen species, including several that had been identified as belonging to Chaos, were to be regarded as synonyms of Amoeba proteus. However, in the description he gives of this organism, it is clearly defined as a uninucleate amoeba, unlike the modern Chaos. A. proteus (=C. chaos), from Joseph Leidy, 1879 In 1900, the biologist H. V. Wilson, at the University of North Carolina, discovered and isolated a giant amoeba that resembled Amoeba proteus but had cellular nuclei numbering in the hundreds. Since there existed already a genus of giant multinucleate amoebae, Pelomyxa, Wilson placed his organism in that taxon, naming it Pelomyxa carolinensis. This amoeba was easily cultivated and became a widely distributed and studied laboratory organism. In 1926, Asa A. Schaeffer argued that Pelomyxa carolinensis was, in fact, identical to the amoeba that had been seen by R√∂sel in 1755, the \\"little Proteus\\" which Linnaeus had named Chaos chaos. Therefore, he urged that, in keeping with the principle of priority governing biological nomenclature, the name of the organism should be Chaos chaos. Several investigators argued vigorously against the validity of that name, but others adopted it. A third faction accepted the validity of the genus Chaos for Wilson's amoeba, but retained the second half of the binomial, referring to the organism as Chaos carolinensis. By the early 1970s, all three names were in use concurrently, by various investigators. However, studies of the fine structure and physiology of the amoeba made it increasingly clear that there were profound differences between it and the other Pelomyxa (including the complete absence, in true Pelomyxa, of mitochondria). Since then, a nomenclatural consensus has emerged, and today the organism is generally known as Chaos carolinensis, as first proposed by Robert L. King and Theodore L. Jahn in 1948. Recent phylogeny Until quite recently, the genus Chaos was included, along with all other protists that extend lobose pseudopods or move about by protoplasmic flow, in the phylum Sarcodina. Molecular phylogenies based on the examination of ribosomal DNA, have shown that Sarcodina is a polyphyletic grouping: that some amoeboids shared a more recent common ancestor with members of other phyla than with other Sarcodina. Consequently, the amoeboids of Sarcodina have been distributed among two newly created supergroups, Rhizaria and Amoebozoa. Chaos and its close relative, Amoeba, are now placed in the latter, within the order Tubulinida: naked amoebas (lacking a test, or shell), either monopodial or possessing somewhat cylindrical pseudopods, with non-adhesive uroid (a region at the posterior of the cell which has a crumpled appearance). While the monophyly of Amoebozoa has yet to be established, current information confirms the status of Chaos and Amoeba as closely related taxa within the group. However, the same research raises questions about the monophyly of the genus Chaos, since Chaos nobile may be basal to a group containing Chaos carolinensis and at least two species of Amoeba , as illustrated below, following Pawlowski and Burki (2009): References External links * Amoebae on the Web * The Amoebae * Microworld Category:Amoebozoa genera Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Chaos (genus)"},{"id":"2595792","text":"The Portevin‚ÄìLe Chatelier effect (PLC) describes a serrated stress‚Äìstrain curve or jerky flow, which some materials exhibit as they undergo plastic deformation, specifically inhomogeneous deformation.Van Den Beukel, A. (1975)\\"Theory of the effect of Dynamic Strain Aging on Mechanical Properties\\" Phys. Stat. Sol. (a) 30, 197 This effect has been long associated with dynamic strain aging or the competition between diffusing solutes pinning dislocations and dislocations breaking free of this stoppage.Abbadi, M., Hahner, P., Zeghloul, A.(2002) \\"On the characteristic of Portevin-Le Chatelier band in aluminum alloy 5182 under stress controlled and strain- controlled tensile testing\\" Materials Science and Engineering A337: 194‚Äì201 The onset of the PLC effect occurs when the strain rate sensitivity becomes negative and inhomogeneous deformation starts. This effect also can appear on the specimen's surface and in bands of plastic deformation. This process starts at a so-called critical strain, which is the minimum strain needed for the onset of the serrations in the stress‚Äìstrain curve. The critical strain is both temperature and strain rate dependent. The existence of a critical strain is attributed to better solute diffusivity due to the deformation created vacancies and increased mobile dislocation density. Both of these contribute to the instability in substitutional alloys, while interstitial alloys are only affected by the increase in mobile dislocation densities.Ananthakrishna, G. (2007)\\"Current theoretical approaches to collective behavior of dislocations\\", Physics Reports 440:113‚Äì259  History  While the effect is named after Portevin and Le Chatelier, they were not the first to discover it. Felix Savart made the discovery when he observed non-homogeneous deformation during a tensile test of copper strips. He documented the physical serrations in his samples that are currently known as Portevin -Le Chatelier bands. A student of Savart, Mason, repeated the experiment while controlling for loading rate. Mason observed that under a constant loading rate, the samples would experience sudden large changes in elongation (as large as a few millimeters).  Underlying Physics  Much of the underlying physics of the Portevin -Le Chatelier effect lies in a specific case of solute drag creep. Adding solute atoms to a pure crystal introduces a size misfit into the system. This size misfit leads to restriction of dislocation motion. At low temperature, these solute atoms are immobile within the lattice, but at high temperatures, the solute atoms become mobile and interact in a more complex manner with the dislocations. When solute atoms are mobile and the dislocation velocity is not too high, the solute atoms and dislocation can move together where the solute atom decreases the motion of the dislocation. The Portevin -Le Chatelier effect occurs in the specific case where solute drag creep is occurring and there is an applied stress, with a material dependent range, on the sample. The applied stress causes the velocity of the dislocations to increase, allowing the dislocation to move away from the solute. This process is commonly referred to as ‚Äúbreakaway‚Äù. Once the dislocation has moved away from the solute, the stress on it decreases which causes its velocity to decrease. This allows the solute atoms to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù with the dislocation. As soon as the solute atom catches up, the stress on the dislocation significantly increases, causing the process to repeat. The cyclic changes described above produce serrations in the plastic region of the stress strain diagram of a tensile test that is undergoing the Portevin -Le Chatelier effect. The variation in stress also causes non- homogeneous deformation to occur throughout the sample which can be visible to the naked eye through observation of a rough finish. Conditions that affect the PLC effect =Temperature= Temperature affects both the speed of band propagation through the material and the critical strain. The speed of band propagation is proportional to the temperature (lower temp lower speeds, higher temp higher speeds). Often the critical strain will first decrease due to temperature. The temperature effect on the PLC regime is caused by the increased ability of the solutes to diffuse to the dislocations with increasing temperature. Although the mechanism of diffusion is not entirely understood, it is believed that solute atoms diffuse by either volume (high temperature), by diffusion in stacking fault ribbons between partial dislocations (intermediate temperature) or pipe diffusion (low temperature). =Strain rate= While temperature is related to the rate of diffusion, strain rate determines the time the dislocations take to overcome these obstacles, and has a dramatic effect on the conditions of the PLC effect. So generally, the critical stress will decrease with imposed strain rate. Also the higher the stress rate, the lower the band speed. =Precipitates= Precipitates, often found in Al alloys (especially of the Mg variety), complicate the PLC effect. Critical strain vs temperature normal vs. inverse behaviorOften these precipitates will cause the so-called inverse behavior, which changes the effect of both strain rate and temperature on the solidBrechet, Y., Estrin, Y.,(2006) \\"On the influence of precipitation of the Portevin-Le Charelier Effect\\" Acta Metall. Mater. Vol. 43:955‚Äì964 The presence of precipitates is shown to have an influence on the appearance and disappearance of serrations in the stress strain curve.Strain rate vs critical strain normal vs. inverse behaviorMannan, S.L.(December 1993) \\"Role of dynamic strain aging on low cycle fatigue.\\" Material Science vol 16 no 5 =Grain size= The structure of the material, as well, has an effect on the appearance and parameters that describe the PLC effect. For example, the magnitude of the stress drops is larger with a smaller grain size. The critical strain often increases with larger grains, which is linked to the dependence of the dislocation density to grain size. Serration amplitude is greater in Al-Mg alloys for a finer grain size. There is a correlation between increasing the critical strain and the onset of serration with increasing grain size.Van Den Beukel, A. and Kocks, U.F.(1982) \\"The strain dependence of static and dynamic strain aging\\" Acta Metall. Vol. 30 But some findings indicate that the grain size has practically no effect on the band velocity or the band width. =Material finish= Polishing the material affects the beginning of the PLC effect and the band velocities. Apparently a rougher surface provides more nucleation points for high stress, which help initiate deformation bands. These bands also propagate twice as fast in the polished specimen. =Non effects= The number of vacancies does not directly affect the PLC start point. It was found that if a material is pre-strained to a value ¬Ω of that required to initiate jerky flow, and then rested at the test temperature or annealed to remove vacancies (but low enough that the dislocation structure is not affected), then the total critical strain is only slightly decreased as well as the types of serrations that do occur.Mulford, R.A. and Kocks, U.F., \\"New Observations on the Mechanism of Dynamic Strain Aging and of jerky Flow\\" Acta Metallurgica Vol 27 Serrations descriptors While properties like strain rate sensitivity and critical strain mark the beginning of the PLC effect, people have developed a system to describe the serrations themselves. These types are often dependent on strain rate, temperature, and grain size. While usually the bands are labeled A, B, and C some sources have added a D and E type Bands.Rodriguez, P.(September 1984) \\"Serrated Plastic flow.\\" Bull. Material Sci. Vol. 6 no 4 Because the type A, B, and C type bands are most found in literature they will be the only ones covered here. Serration types =Type A bands= Type A bands are often seen at high strain rate and low temperatures. They are a random development of bands that form over the entire specimen.Bruggemann, C., Bohlke, T, Bertram, A. (2008) \\"Modeling and simulation of the Portevin Le Chatelier Effect\\" Micro- Macro-Interactions: In Structured Media and Particle SystemsBerlin: Springer- Verlag:53‚Äì62 They are usually described as continuously propagating with small stress drops. =Type B bands= Type B bands are sometimes described as ‚Äúhopping‚Äù bands and they appear at a medium to high strain rates. They are often seen as each band forming ahead of the previous one in a spatially correlated way. The serrations are more irregular with smaller amplitudes than type C. =Type C bands= C bands are often seen at low applied strain rate or high temperatures. These are identified with random nucleated static bands with large characteristic stress drops the serration. =Other notes on band types= The different types of bands are believed to represent different states of dislocation in the bands, and band types can change in a materials stress strain curve. Currently there are no models that can capture the change in band types Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect is a proof of non-uniform deformation of CuNi25 commercial alloys at intermediate temperature. In CuNi25 alloy it manifests itself as irregularities in the form of serrations on the stress‚Äìstrain curve. It proves instability of force during tension and heterogeneity of microstructure and presence of many heterogeneous factors, affecting its mechanical properties.Sakiewicz P.,Nowosielski R., Babilas R. Production aspects of inhomogeneous hot deformation in as-cast CuNi25 alloy, Indian Journal of Engineering & Materials Sciences, Vol. 22, August 2015, pp. 389‚Äì398 Problems caused by the PLC effect Because the PLC effect is related to a strengthening mechanism, the strength of steel may increase; however, the plasticity and ductility of a material afflicted by the PLC effect decrease drastically. The PLC effect is known to induce blue brittleness in steel; additionally, the loss of ductility may cause rough surfaces to develop during deformation (Al-Mg alloys are especially susceptible to this), rendering them useless for autobody or casting applications.

The region in which they lived was also called A≈õvaka. According to some scholars, the name A≈õvakan or Aspasioi is preserved in the modern ethnonym Afghan (historically used for Pashtuns; also used in Afghanistan), and the tribal name Esapzai (whose Arabized form is Yusufzai).  Etymology  The Sanskrit term a≈õva, Avestan aspa, and Prakrit assa means horse. The name A≈õvaka/A≈õvakan or Assaka is derived from the Sanskrit A≈õva or Prakrit Assa and it denotes someone connected with the horses, hence a horseman, or a cavalryman or horse breeder. The A≈õvakas were especially engaged in the occupation of breeding, raising and training war horses, as also in providing expert cavalry services.

According to philologist J.W. McCrindle, the name A≈õvaka is also \\"distinctly preserved\\" in the name of the Esapzai (or Yusufzai) tribe of Pashtuns. McCrindle noted: \\"The name of the A≈õvaka indicates that their country was renowned in primitive times, as it is at the present day, for its superior breed of horses. The fact that the Greeks translated their name into \\"Hippasioi\\" (from ·ºµœÄœÄŒøœÇ, a horse) shows that they must have been aware of its etymological signification.\\"  Ethnology  Ancient Greek historians who documented the exploits of Alexander the Great refer to the Aspasioi and Assakenoi (·ºàœÉœÉŒ±Œ∫Œ∑ŒΩŒøŒØ) tribes among his opponents. The historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar has said that these words are probably corruptions of A≈õvaka. It is possible that the corruption of the names occurred due to regional differences in pronunciation. Rama Shankar Tripathi thinks it possible that the Assakenoi were either allied to or a branch of the Aspasioi. The Greeks recorded the two groups as inhabiting different areas, with the Aspasioi in either the Alishang or Kunar Valley and the Assakenoi in the Swat Valley. The A≈õvaka may have been a sub-group of the Kamboja tribe that is referenced in ancient Sanskrit and Pali literature, such as the Mahabharata and Puranas, and which were partitioned into eastern and western A≈õvakas. Barbara West treats the ethnonyms Kamboja, A≈õvaka, Aspasioi, Assakenoi and Asvakayana as synonyms.  History  The Assakenoi fielded 2,000 cavalry, 30 elephants and 30,000 infantry against Alexander during his campaign in India, which began in 327 BCE, but they eventually had to surrender after losses at places such as Beira, Massaga and Ora. The Aspasioi chose to flee into the hills but destroyed their city of Arigaion before doing so; 40,000 of them were captured, along with 230,000 oxen. Diodorus recorded the strength of the A≈õvaka opposition, noting that the women took up arms along with the men, preferring \\"a glorious death to a life of dishonour\\". The Asvayanas have been attested to be good cattle breeders and agriculturists by classical writers. Arrian said that, during the time of Alexander, there were a large number of bullocks - 230,000 - of a size and shape superior to what the Macedonians had known, which Alexander captured from them and decided to send to Macedonia for agriculture.

The community has been since early 2006 a major investment and activity centre for village renewal. Geography =Location= Neuh√§usel lies in the area of the Augst communities (a small region) and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Montabaur, a kind of collective municipality. Its seat is in the like-named town. Environmentally, Neuh√§usel is part of the Lower Westerwald in the Nassau Nature Park. History Musbach, which had its first documentary mention in 1198 as Neuh√§usel's forerunner, was a small village that lay near where today's Ortsgemeinde lies. It was followed by Neuspay, which had its last documentary mention in 1537, and Wirt beym Creutz, named in 1669. In 1675, the name Neuh√§usel appeared for the first time. The community, which in 1789 was joined with the community of Eitelborn, became a separate community on 5 April 1810. Owing to its location on the important traffic link between the Rhine and the Westerwald, Neuh√§usel developed over the centuries from a rest stop for travelling people to a community with the character of a centre. Politics =Community council= The council is made up of 16 council members who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 13 June 2004. *CDU 7 seats *SPD 2 seats *UBG 3 seats *FWV 4 seats =Coat of arms= Trade, transport and the community on both sides of the road are represented in the community's arms by the two half wagon wheels and the silver field in the middle. The old St. Anna-Kirche (church) built in 1877 is shown as a red steeple with a west portal. Saint Donatus is symbolized by a blue sword with a golden grip. The green double flank represents the community's charming location. =Town partnerships= Sauvigny-les-Bois, Ni√®vre, France, since 1992 Economy and infrastructure =Transport= The community is linked to the road network through Bundesstra√üe 49 (Montabaur-Koblenz). =Fire services= The Verbandsgemeinde of Montabaur maintains three fire stations within its limits, one of which is in Neuh√§usel. Its response area includes not only Neuh√§usel, but also the municipal areas of Eitelborn, Kadenbach and Simmern.

It was named after the Palazzo della Signoria, also called Palazzo Vecchio. It is the main point of the origin and history of the Florentine Republic and still maintains its reputation as the political focus of the city. It is the meeting place of Florentines as well as the numerous tourists, located near Palazzo Vecchio and Piazza del Duomo and gateway to Uffizi Gallery. Buildings The impressive 14th-century Palazzo Vecchio is still preeminent with its crenellated tower. The square is also shared with the Loggia della Signoria, the Uffizi Gallery, the Palace of the Tribunale della Mercanzia (1359) (now the Bureau of Agriculture), and the Palazzo Uguccioni (1550, with a facade attributed to Raphael, who however died thirty years before its construction). Located in front of the Palazzo Vecchio is the Palace of the Assicurazioni Generali (1871, built in Renaissance style). =Palazzo Vecchio= Palazzo Vecchio The Palazzo Vecchio (\\"Old Palace\\") is the town hall of the city. This massive, Romanesque, crenellated fortress- palace is among the most impressive town halls of Tuscany. Overlooking the square with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi, it is one of the most significant public places in Italy, and it hosts cultural points and museums. Originally called the Palazzo della Signoria, after the Signoria of Florence, the ruling body of the Republic of Florence, it was also given several other names: Palazzo del Popolo, Palazzo dei Priori, and Palazzo Ducale, in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. =Loggia dei Lanzi= Loggia dei Lanzi Giacomo Brogi, 'Piazza della Signoria, Florence,' c. 1873‚Äì1881, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, Department of Image Collections. The Loggia dei Lanzi consists of wide arches open to the street, three bays wide and one bay deep. The arches rest on clustered pilasters with Corinthian capitals. The wide arches appealed so much to the Florentines, that Michelangelo even proposed that they should be continued all around the Piazza della Signoria. The vivacious construction of the Loggia is in stark contrast with the severe architecture of the Palazzo Vecchio. It is effectively an open-air sculpture gallery of antique and Renaissance art including the Medici lions. =Tribunale della Mercanzia= The Tribunale della Mercanzia (Tribunal of Merchandise) is a building where in the past lawyers judged in the trial between merchants. Here was a porch painted by Taddeo Gaddi, Antonio del Pollaiolo and Sandro Botticelli, today stored in the Uffizi gallery. =Palazzo Uguccioni= Built for Giovanni Uguccioni since 1550, its design has been variously attributed to Raphael, Michelangelo, Bartolomeo Ammannati or Raffaello da Montelupo. =Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali= The Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali was designed in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1871, and is one of the very few purpose-built commercial buildings in the centre of the city. On the ground floor of this palace is the historical caf√® Rivoire. =Other palaces= Other palaces are the palazzo dei Buonaguisi and the palazzo dell'Arte dei Mercatanti. Statues The statues in front of the Palazzo Vecchio. Painting of Savonarola's execution in the Piazza della Signoria Various imposing statues ring this square including: #Copy of Michelangelo's David. at the entrance of the Palazzo Vecchio; the original by Michelangelo is housed in the Galleria dell'Accademia, adjacent to the Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts. #Equestrian Monument of Cosimo I, honoring Cosimo I de' Medici and sculpted by Giambologna (1594) #Fountain of Neptune by Bartolomeo Ammannati (1575) #Il Marzocco, (the Lion) with a copy of the Florentine Lily, originally made by Donatello (copy) #Judith and Holofernes, by Donatello (copy) #Hercules and Cacus, by Bandinelli (1533) #The Rape of the Sabine Women, in the Loggia dei Lanzi by Giambologna (1583) http://www.visual-arts- cork.com/sculpture/rape-of-the-sabine-women.htm #Perseus with the Head of Medusa, in the Loggia dei Lanzi by Cellini (1554) #Medici lions, by Fancelli and Vacca (1598) The piazza was already a central square in the original Roman town Florentia, surrounded by a theatre, Roman baths and a workshop for dyeing textiles. Later there was a church San Romolo, a loggia and an enormous 5th- century basilica. This was shown by the archaeological treasures found beneath the square when it was repaved in the 1980s. Even remains of a Neolithic site were found. The square started taking shape from 1268 on, when houses of Ghibellines were pulled down by the victorious Guelphs. The square remained a long time untidy, full of holes. In 1385 it was paved for the first time. In 1497 Girolamo Savonarola and his followers carried out on this square the famous Bonfire of the Vanities, burning in a large pile books, gaming tables, fine dresses, and works of poets. In front of the fountain of Neptune, a round marble plaque marks the exact spot where Girolamo Savonarola was hanged and burned on May 23, 1498.

Ashley. First published in 1944, it was the culmination of over 11 years of work. The book contains 3,854 numbered entries and approximately 7,000 illustrations. The entries include knot instructions, uses, and some histories, categorized by type or function. It remains one of the most important and comprehensive books on knots. Use as a reference Due to its scope and wide availability, The Ashley Book of Knots has become a significant reference work in the field of knotting. The numbers Ashley assigned to each knot can be used to unambiguously identify them. This helps to identify knots despite local colloquialisms or identification changes. Citations to Ashley numbers are usually in the form: \\"The Constrictor Knot (ABOK #1249)\\", \\"ABOK #1249\\" or even simply \\"#1249\\" if the context of the reference is clear or already established. Some knots have more than one Ashley number due to having multiple uses or forms. For example, the main entry for #1249 is in the chapter on binding knots but it is also listed as #176 in a chapter on occupational knot usage. The Ashley Book of Knots was compiled and first published before the introduction of synthetic fiber ropes, during a time when natural fiber cordage - typically twisted, laid, or braided rope - was most commonly used. The commentary on some knots may fail to address their behavior when tied with modern synthetic fiber or kernmantle style ropes. Corrections and additions Ashley suffered a debilitating stroke the year after the book was published. He was not able to produce an erratum or oversee a corrected edition. Corrections submitted by the International Guild of Knot Tyers were incorporated in 1991.Ashley(1993), p.

Additional errors have been identified since the 1991 corrections.For an example see the footnotes in harness loop and butterfly loop articles.

JADE is one such language. A persistent programming language is a programming language extended with constructs to handle persistent data. It is distinguished from embedded SQL in at least two ways: In a persistent programming language: * The query language is fully integrated with the host language and both share the same type system. * Any format changes required between the host language and the database are carried out transparently. In Embedded SQL: * Where the host language and data manipulation language have different type systems, code conversion operates outside of the OO type system, and hence has a higher chance of having undetected errors. * Format conversion must be handled explicitly and takes a substantial amount of code. Using Embedded SQL, a programmer is responsible for writing explicit code to fetch data into memory or store data back to the database. In a persistent programming language, a programmer can manipulate persistent data without having to write such code explicitly. The drawbacks of persistent programming languages include: * While they are powerful, it is easy to make programming errors that damage the database. * It is harder to do automatic high-level optimization. * They do not support declarative querying well.

The term blimp itself is defined as a - without any internal structure, the pressure of lifting gas contained within the airship envelope maintains the vessel's shape. From the launch of the Pilgrim in 1925 to the retiring of the Spirit of Innovation in 2017, Goodyear generally owned and operated non-rigid airships in its global public relations fleet. In 2014, however, Goodyear began to replace its three U.S. non-rigid airships (blimps) with three new semi-rigid airships, each of which have a rigid internal frame. Although technically incorrect, Goodyear continues to use \\"blimp\\" in reference to these new semi- rigid dirigibles. Wingfoot One, the first such model in Goodyear's U.S. fleet, was christened on August 23, 2014, near the company's headquarters in Akron, Ohio. Airship fleet In May 2011, Goodyear announced it was replacing its fleet of non-rigid airships with three semi-rigid airships built by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. Goodyear's U.S. fleet consists of three semi-rigid airships (model LZ N07-101): *Wingfoot One (N1A), based out of Pompano Beach Airpark in Pompano Beach, Florida *Wingfoot Two (N2A), based out of Goodyear Blimp Base Airport in Carson, California *Wingfoot Three (N3A), based out of Wingfoot Lake Airship Operations Balloonport in Suffield, Ohiohttps://www.ohio.com/akron/business/goodyears-wingfoot-three-airship- debuts-on-first-day-of-summer The new airships are 246 feet long, 52 feet longer than Goodyear's old model, the GZ-20. The Zeppelin NT model is also slimmer, has a top speed of 70 miles per hour (versus 50 for the blimp), and has a passenger gondola that seats 12 (compared to seven in the blimp). The gondola also contains a restroom. Both craft are outfitted with LED sign technology Goodyear calls \\"Eaglevision.\\" This allows the aircraft to display bright, multi-colored, animated words and images. Goodyear also has had blimps operating in other parts of the world. These airships were built and operated by The Lightship Group of Orlando, Florida. In 2012, The Lightship Group was acquired (along with the American Blimp Corporation) by Van Wagner Communications LLC, and operated as the Van Wagner Airship Group until November 17, 2017, when it was purchased by Airsign Inc. They currently operate an airship for Goodyear in China. Lifting agent The blimps are filled with helium. The helium is maintained under low pressure, so small punctures do not pose serious consequences for the blimp. One inspection element of the blimps is to look into the envelope for pinpoints of light which are indicative of small holes. The Goodyear blimps were non-rigid (meaning their shape is not maintained by a rigid internal structure) dirigibles (directable/steerable airships). Inside their exterior envelope, the Goodyear blimps are fitted with air‚Äìfilled ballonets. As the blimp ascends or descends, the internal ballonets expand or contract to compensate for density changes and to maintain uniform pressure in the envelope. The latest craft, a Zeppelin NT is a departure from this tradition, as it is a Semi-rigid airship that makes use of a structural truss inside the envelope to provide some of its structural strength. Models \\"GZ\\" stands for Goodyear-Zeppelin, stemming from the partnership Goodyear had with the German company when both were building airships together. However these models came many years after this partnership had dissolved during the start of World War II. The GZ-1 was the USS Akron (ZRS-4), the U.S. Navy's fourth rigid airship used for several tests including as a flying \\"aircraft carrier\\". *GZ-19: Introduced in 1963 and discontinued in 1978 after the Mayflower (N38A) was destroyed by a tornado. The design for this class resembles the U.S. Navy's L class blimp. *GZ-20: This class was introduced in 1969, with America (N10A) and Columbia (N3A) being the first two. The Europa (N2A) followed in 1972 and was based in Italy, the first Goodyear blimp operated outside of the United States. These blimps are slightly longer than the GZ-19. Beginning in 2014, Goodyear began retiring the GZ-20 and replacing them with the Zeppelin NT. On February 23, 2014, Spirit of Goodyear was retired in Pompano Beach after the 2014 Daytona 500. On August 10, 2015, the California-based GZ-20, the Spirit of America, was decommissioned. The Spirit of Innovation, took over California operations in September 2015 until its retirement in March 2017 as the last remaining GZ-20. In fall of 2017, Wingfoot Two will be relocated to California. *GZ-22: The only airship in this class was the Spirit of Akron (N4A). Originally built in 1987 to show the U.S. Department of Defense that airships were still militarily viable, it was the largest and most technically advanced ship Goodyear ever had in its public relations fleet, featuring fly-by-wire technology. However, Spirit of Akron was lost in 1999 and the company has not built one since, most likely because of the large expense to build and operate one due to its size and advanced technology. *LZ N07-101: In May 2011, Goodyear announced that it would be replacing its aging fleet of GZ-20 blimps (non-rigid airships) with Zeppelin NT airships. Construction began in 2012 on the first of three new semi-rigid airships; completed in March 2014, Wingfoot One was christened on August 23, 2014, by Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts. Wingfoot Two, the name of Goodyear's second semi-rigid airship, was unveiled in April 2016. The third finished the fleet in 2018. Shaesta Waiz, the youngest woman to fly solo around the world, christened Wingfoot Three during an August 30 ceremony in Akron, with the traditional smashing of a bottle of champagne across the bow. \\"Wingfoot Three will serve as a beacon for me to continue my work inspiring and celebrating aviation with others,\\" said Waiz. She joined a list of other famous Goodyear airship christeners, including Amelia Earhart and astronaut Sally Ride. =Historical navy classes= *C class blimp 1918‚Äì1919 *D class blimp 1920‚Äì1924 *F class blimp/Type FB 1918‚Äì1923 *Goodyear Type AD 1925‚Äì1931 *G class blimp 1935‚Äì19? *H class blimp 1921‚Äì1923 *J class blimp 1922‚Äì1940 *K class blimp 1938‚Äì1959, WWII anti-submarine, post-war tests K-1 1938‚Äì1940, pre-war experimental *L class blimp 1930s‚Äì1945, WWII *M class blimp 1944‚Äì1956 *N class blimp 1950s‚Äì1962 *Goodyear ZWG 1950s Dimensions A Goodyear blimp, near Manchester, England, evening of 30 April 2012 According to the Goodyear website, the now retired GZ-20 blimps were 192 feet (58 meters) long, 59.5 feet (18 meters) tall, and 50 feet (15 meters) wide. For comparison, the largest airships ever built, the Zeppelin company's Hindenburg, LZ-129, and the Graf Zeppelin II, LZ-130, were both 804 feet (245 meters) long and 135 feet (41 meters) in diameter. That is, over four times as long and over twice as wide as the current Goodyear blimps. The largest blimp ever made by Goodyear was the U.S. Navy's ZPG-3, at 403 feet (121 meters) in length. Names 1933 Chicago World's Fair Since 1928, Goodyear had traditionally named its blimps after the U.S. winners of the America's Cup yacht race. This naming method is attributed to then-Goodyear CEO P. W. Litchfield, who viewed the airships as \\"aerial yachts\\". Although that practice deviated with the introduction of the Spirit of Akron in 1987, the tradition ended with the Florida-based Stars & Stripes in 2005. In 2006, Goodyear began having the public participate in the naming of their airships, they dubbed this the \\"Name the Blimp\\" contest. Spirit of Innovation was the first airship to be named by the public. The America's Cup winners' names: Puritan, Reliance, Defender, Volunteer, Resolute, Vigilant, Mayflower, Ranger, Rainbow, Enterprise, Columbia, America, Stars & Stripes. Non-cup winners' names: Pilgrim, Neponset, Spirit of Akron, Spirit of Goodyear, Eagle, Spirit of America, Spirit of Innovation, Wingfoot One, Wingfoot Two. Foreign based blimps have been operated by The Lightship Group since the 1990s: Europa, Spirit of Europe, Spirit of the South Pacific, Spirit of the Americas, Spirit of Safety, Ventura, Ling Hang Zhe (Navigator). Passenger policy The only passengers that Goodyear will allow on the blimps are corporate guests of the company and members of the press; it has been Goodyear's long-standing policy that no public rides are offered. However, for over 50 years, it had to offer limited public rides at its Miami, Florida, winter base on Watson Island as part of its land-lease deal with the city in order to operate from the island. That practice ended in 1979 when the base was moved to Opa-locka, Florida. Sometimes Goodyear has a contest with the dealers of its tires. If a customer buys four new Goodyear tires, they are entered into a contest to take a flight in the blimp. The winner must go to the nearest blimp base to take their flight. During the period in which Goodyear supplied tires for Indy cars, it was a tradition that the pole position winner at the Indianapolis 500 would get a ride in the blimp in the days leading up to the race.\\"The Legends of the Brickyard\\" ‚Äì 1985 Indianapolis 500 Highlight Film, ESPN During the period in which Goodyear was a corporate sponsor of the All American Soap Box Derby, the winners of the World Championship races held each July in Akron, OH were awarded a ride in the blimp. http://aasbd.com/webdev/aasbd73/f-prizes.html Typically these rides were given on the day following the annual race, but if weather prohibited the blimp from flying on that day, the champions were given an award letter from Goodyear. This letter was basically a lifetime ticket for one blimp ride to be taken whenever arrangements could be made between all parties involved. Night signs For years, Goodyear has fitted its blimps with a night sign. From neon tubes, to incandescent lamps to LEDs, these signs have helped the company advertise its products and also deliver public service messages from various organizations such as local governments. *Neon-O-Gram Originally called NeonGoodyear, was first fitted on Defender in the 1930s. Neon tubes on the sides of the blimp which usually spelled out 'Goodyear'. *10 Panel Incandescent Bulbs *Skytacular: In the mid-1960s, the GZ-19 Mayflower (N4A) was fitted with over 3,000 incandescent lamps of red, yellow, blue and green on both sides that for the first time featured animation.

The pilot, Michael Nerandzic, flew the airship low enough that passengers could jump to the ground, and all three did indeed leap to safety. Nerandzic then, while still able to maintain some control on the burning blimp, climbed away so that fire or wreckage would not hit the escapees; soon after, Nerandzic died in the blimp's fiery wreck.Nathan Klein, \\"Heroic Aussie pilot in airship tragedy,\\" The Daily Telegraph, June 14, 2011, retrieved June 13, 2011.

Their historic home is Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota, which in the Dakota language was called Mde wakan (mystic/spiritual lake). Together with the Wahpekute (Wa»üp√©khute ‚Äì \\"Shooters Among the Trees\\"), they form the so-called Upper Council of the Dakota or Santee Sioux (Is√°≈ãy√°thi ‚Äì \\"Knife Makers\\"). History Their Siouan-speaking ancestors may have migrated to the upper Midwest from further south and east. Over the years they migrated up through present-day Ohio and into Wisconsin. Facing competition from the Ojibwe and other Great Lakes Native American tribes, the Santee moved further west into present-day Minnesota.

Originally the term Santee was applied only to the Mdewakanton and later the closely related and allied Wahpekute.

In the fall of 1837, the Mdewakantonwan negotiated a lucrative deal with the US government under an \\"Indian Removal\\" treaty, whereby they were paid nearly one million dollars for the remainder of their lands in western Wisconsin. Because the Mdewakantonwan had earlier abandoned the lands due to intrusion by the Chippewa and various ecological reasons, and were effectively living in Minnesota, they effectively gained payment for land they no longer occupied.

Alternatively and similarly, \\"determinacy\\" is the property of a game whereby such a strategy exists. The games studied in set theory are usually Gale- Stewart games--two-player games of perfect information in which the players make an infinite sequence of moves and there are no draws. The field of game theory studies more general kinds of games, including games with draws such as tic-tac-toe, chess, or infinite chess, or games with imperfect information such as poker. Basic notions =Games= The first sort of game we shall consider is the two-player game of perfect information of length œâ, in which the players play natural numbers. These games are often called Gale-Stewart games. In this sort of game there are two players, often named I and II, who take turns playing natural numbers, with I going first. They play \\"forever\\"; that is, their plays are indexed by the natural numbers. When they're finished, a predetermined condition decides which player won. This condition need not be specified by any definable rule; it may simply be an arbitrary (infinitely long) lookup table saying who has won given a particular sequence of plays. More formally, consider a subset A of Baire space; recall that the latter consists of all œâ-sequences of natural numbers. Then in the game GA, I plays a natural number a0, then II plays a1, then I plays a2, and so on. Then I wins the game if and only if : \\\\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle\\\\in A and otherwise II wins. A is then called the payoff set of GA. It is assumed that each player can see all moves preceding each of his moves, and also knows the winning condition. =Strategies= Informally, a strategy for a player is a way of playing in which his plays are entirely determined by the foregoing plays. Again, such a \\"way\\" does not have to be capable of being captured by any explicable \\"rule\\", but may simply be a lookup table. More formally, a strategy for player I (for a game in the sense of the preceding subsection) is a function that accepts as an argument any finite sequence of natural numbers, of even length, and returns a natural number. If œÉ is such a strategy and <a0,...,a2n-1> is a sequence of plays, then œÉ(<a0,...,a2n-1>) is the next play I will make, if I is following the strategy œÉ. Strategies for II are just the same, substituting \\"odd\\" for \\"even\\". Note that we have said nothing, as yet, about whether a strategy is in any way good. A strategy might direct a player to make aggressively bad moves, and it would still be a strategy. In fact it is not necessary even to know the winning condition for a game, to know what strategies exist for the game. =Winning strategies= A strategy is winning if the player following it must necessarily win, no matter what his opponent plays. For example, if œÉ is a strategy for I, then œÉ is a winning strategy for I in the game GA if, for any sequence of natural numbers to be played by II, say <a1,a3,a5,...>, the sequence of plays produced by œÉ when II plays thus, namely : \\\\langle\\\\sigma(\\\\langle\\\\rangle),a_1,\\\\sigma(\\\\langle\\\\sigma(\\\\langle\\\\rangle),a_1\\\\rangle),a_3,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle is an element of A. =Determined games= A (class of) game(s) is determined if for all instances of the game there is a winning strategy for one of the players (not necessarily the same player for each instance). Note that there cannot be a winning strategy for both players for the same game, for if there were, the two strategies could be played against each other. The resulting outcome would then, by hypothesis, be a win for both players, which is impossible.https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/Infinite Games, Yurii Khomskii (2010) Infinite Games, Yurii Khomskii (2010) Determinacy from elementary considerations All finite games of perfect information in which draws do not occur are determined. Real-world games of perfect information, such as tic- tac-toe, chess, or infinite chess, are always finished in a finite number of moves (in chess-games this assumes the 50-move rule is applied). If such a game is modified so that a particular player wins under any condition where the game would have been called a draw, then it is always determined. The condition that the game is always over (i.e. all possible extensions of the finite position result in a win for the same player) in a finite number of moves corresponds to the topological condition that the set A giving the winning condition for GA is clopen in the topology of Baire space. For example, modifying the rules of chess to make drawn games a win for Black makes chess a determined game.\\"Infinite Chess, PBS Infinite Series\\" PBS Infinite Series, with sources including academic papers by J. Hamkins (infinite chess:: https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4377 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08155). As it happens, chess has a finite number of positions and a draw-by-repetition rules, so with these modified rules, if play continues long enough without White having won, then Black can eventually force a win (due to the modification of draw = win for black). The proof that such games are determined is rather simple: Player I simply plays not to lose; that is, player I plays to make sure that player II does not have a winning strategy after I's move. If player I cannot do this, then it means player II had a winning strategy from the beginning. On the other hand, if player I can play in this way, then I must win, because the game will be over after some finite number of moves, and player I can't have lost at that point. This proof does not actually require that the game always be over in a finite number of moves, only that it be over in a finite number of moves whenever II wins. That condition, topologically, is that the set A is closed. This fact‚Äîthat all closed games are determined‚Äîis called the Gale‚ÄìStewart theorem. Note that by symmetry, all open games are determined as well. (A game is open if I can win only by winning in a finite number of moves.) Determinacy from ZFC David Gale and F. M. Stewart proved the open and closed games are determined. Determinacy for second level of the Borel hierarchy games was shown by Wolfe in 1955. Over the following 20 years, additional research using ever-more- complicated arguments established that third and fourth levels of the Borel hierarchy are determined. In 1975, Donald A. Martin proved that all Borel games are determined; that is, if A is a Borel subset of Baire space, then GA is determined. This result, known as Borel determinacy, is the best possible determinacy result provable in ZFC, in the sense that the determinacy of the next higher Wadge class is not provable in ZFC. In 1971, before Martin obtained his proof, Harvey Friedman showed that any proof of Borel determinacy must use the axiom of replacement in an essential way, in order to iterate the powerset axiom transfinitely often. Friedman's work gives a level-by-level result detailing how many iterations of the powerset axiom are necessary to guarantee determinacy at each level of the Borel hierarchy. For every integer n, ZFC\\\\P proves determinacy in the nth level of the difference hierarchy of \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_3 sets, but ZFC\\\\P does not prove that for every integer n nth level of the difference hierarchy of \\\\Pi^0_3 sets is determined. See reverse mathematics for other relations between determinacy and subsystems of second- order arithmetic. Determinacy and large cardinals There is an intimate relationship between determinacy and large cardinals. In general, stronger large cardinal axioms prove the determinacy of larger pointclasses, higher in the Wadge hierarchy, and the determinacy of such pointclasses, in turn, proves the existence of inner models of slightly weaker large cardinal axioms than those used to prove the determinacy of the pointclass in the first place. =Measurable cardinals= It follows from the existence of a measurable cardinal that every analytic game (also called a Œ£11 game) is determined, or equivalently that every coanalytic (or Œ†11 ) game is determined. (See Projective hierarchy for definitions.) Actually a measurable cardinal is more than enough. A weaker principle ‚Äî the existence of 0# is sufficient to prove coanalytic determinacy, and a little bit more: The precise result is that the existence of 0# is equivalent to the determinacy of all levels of the difference hierarchy below the œâ2 level, i.e. œâ¬∑n-Œ†11 determinacy for every n. From a measurable cardinal we can improve this very slightly to œâ2-Œ†11 determinacy. From the existence of more measurable cardinals, one can prove the determinacy of more levels of the difference hierarchy over Œ†11. Proof of determinacy from sharps For every real number r, \\\\Sigma^1_1(r) determinacy is equivalent to existence of r#. To illustrate how large cardinals lead to determinacy, here is a proof of \\\\Sigma^1_1(r) determinacy given existence of r#. Let A be a \\\\Sigma^1_1(r) subset of the Baire space. A = p[T] for some tree T (constructible from r) on (œâ, œâ). (That is x‚ààA iff from some y, ((x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),...) is a path through T.) Given a partial play s, let T_s be the subtree of T consistent with s subject to max(y0,y1,...,ylen(s)-1)<len(s). The additional condition ensures that T_s is finite. Consistency means that every path through T_s is of the form ((x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),...,(x_i,y_i)) where (x_0,x_1,...,x_i) is an initial segment of s. To prove that A is determined, define auxiliary game as follows: In addition to ordinary moves, player 2 must play a mapping of T_s into ordinals (below a sufficiently large ordinal Œ∫) such that * each new move extends the previous mapping and * the ordering of the ordinals agrees with the Kleene‚ÄìBrouwer order on T_s. Recall that Kleene‚ÄìBrouwer order is like lexicographical order except that if s properly extends t then s<t. It is a well-ordering iff the tree is well-founded. The auxiliary game is open. Proof: If player 2 does not lose at a finite stage, then the union of all T_s (which is the tree that corresponds to the play) is well-founded, and so the result of the non-auxiliary play is not in A. Thus, the auxiliary game is determined. Proof: By transfinite induction, for each ordinal Œ± compute the set of positions where player 1 can force a win in Œ± steps, where a position with player 2 to move is losing (for player 2) in Œ± steps iff for every move the resulting position is losing in less than Œ± steps. One strategy for player 1 is to reduce Œ± with each position (say picking the least Œ± and breaking ties by picking the least move), and one strategy for player 2 is to pick the least (actually any would work) move that does not lead to a position with an Œ± assigned. Note that L(r) contains the set of winning positions as well as the winning strategies given above. A winning strategy for player 2 in the original game leads to winning strategy in the auxiliary game: The subtree of T corresponding to the winning strategy is well-founded, so player 2 can pick ordinals based on the Kleene‚ÄìBrouwer order of the tree. Also, trivially, a winning strategy for player 2 in the auxiliary game gives a winning strategy for player 2 in original game. It remains to show that using r#, the above- mentioned winning strategy for player 1 in the auxiliary game can be converted into a winning strategy in the original game. r# gives a proper class I of (L(r),‚àà,r) indiscernible ordinals. By indiscernibility, if Œ∫ and the ordinals in the auxiliary response are in I, then the moves by player 1 do not depend on the auxiliary moves (or on Œ∫), and so the strategy can be converted into a strategy for the original game (since player 2 can hold out with indiscernibles for any finite number of steps). Suppose that player 1 loses in the original game. Then, the tree corresponding to a play is well-founded. Therefore, player 2 can win the auxiliary game by using auxiliary moves based on the indiscernibles (since the order type of indiscernibles exceeds the Kleene‚ÄìBrouwer order of the tree), which contradicts player 1 winning the auxiliary game. =Woodin cardinals= If there is a Woodin cardinal with a measurable cardinal above it, then Œ†12 determinacy holds. More generally, if there are n Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them all, then Œ†1n+1 determinacy holds. From Œ†1n+1 determinacy, it follows that there is a transitive inner model containing n Woodin cardinals. \\\\Delta^1_2 (lightface) determinacy is equiconsistent with a Woodin cardinal. If \\\\Delta^1_2 determinacy holds, then for a Turing cone of x (that is for every real x of sufficiently high Turing degree), L[x] satisfies OD-determinacy (that is determinacy of games on integers of length œâ and ordinal-definable payoff), and in HODL[x] \\\\omega_2^{L[x]} is a Woodin cardinal. =Projective determinacy= If there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals, then projective determinacy holds; that is, every game whose winning condition is a projective set is determined. From projective determinacy it follows that, for every natural number n, there is a transitive inner model that satisfies that there are n Woodin cardinals. =Axiom of determinacy= The axiom of determinacy, or AD, asserts that every two-player game of perfect information of length œâ, in which the players play naturals, is determined. AD is provably false from ZFC; using the axiom of choice one may prove the existence of a non-determined game. However, if there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals with a measurable above them all, then L(R) is a model of ZF that satisfies AD. Consequences of determinacy =Regularity properties for sets of reals= If A is a subset of Baire space such that the Banach‚ÄìMazur game for A is determined, then either II has a winning strategy, in which case A is meager, or I has a winning strategy, in which case A is comeager on some open neighborhood. This does not quite imply that A has the property of Baire, but it comes close: A simple modification of the argument shows that if Œì is an adequate pointclass such that every game in Œì is determined, then every set of reals in Œì has the property of Baire. In fact this result is not optimal; by considering the unfolded Banach‚ÄìMazur game we can show that determinacy of Œì (for Œì with sufficient closure properties) implies that every set of reals that is the projection of a set in Œì has the property of Baire. So for example the existence of a measurable cardinal implies Œ†11 determinacy, which in turn implies that every Œ£12 set of reals has the property of Baire. By considering other games, we can show that Œ†1n determinacy implies that every Œ£1n+1 set of reals has the property of Baire, is Lebesgue measurable (in fact universally measurable) and has the perfect set property. =Periodicity theorems= * The first periodicity theorem implies that, for every natural number n, if Œî12n+1 determinacy holds, then Œ†12n+1 and Œ£12n+2 have the prewellordering property (and that Œ£12n+1 and Œ†12n+2 do not have the prewellordering property, but rather have the separation property). * The second periodicity theorem implies that, for every natural number n, if Œî12n+1 determinacy holds, then Œ†12n+1 and Œ£12n have the scale property. In particular, if projective determinacy holds, then every projective relation has a projective uniformization. * The third periodicity theorem gives a sufficient condition for a game to have a definable winning strategy. =Applications to decidability of certain second- order theories= In 1969, Michael O. Rabin proved that the second-order theory of n successors is decidable. A key component of the proof requires showing determinacy of parity games, which lie in the third level of the Borel hierarchy. =Wadge determinacy= Wadge determinacy is the statement that for all pairs A, B of subsets of Baire space, the Wadge game G(A ,B) is determined. Similarly for a pointclass Œì, Œì Wadge determinacy is the statement that for all sets A, B in Œì, the Wadge game G(A, B) is determined. Wadge determinacy implies the semilinear ordering principle for the Wadge order. Another consequence of Wadge determinacy is the perfect set property. In general, Œì Wadge determinacy is a consequence of the determinacy of Boolean combinations of sets in Œì. In the projective hierarchy, Œ†11 Wadge determinacy is equivalent to Œ†11 determinacy, as proved by Leo Harrington. This result was extended by Hjorth to prove that Œ†12 Wadge determinacy (and in fact the semilinear ordering principle for Œ†12) already implies Œ†12 determinacy. More general games =Games in which the objects played are not natural numbers= Determinacy of games on ordinals with ordinal definable payoff and length œâ implies that for every regular cardinal Œ∫>œâ there are no ordinal definable disjoint stationary subsets of Œ∫ made of ordinals of cofinality œâ. The consistency strength of the determinacy hypothesis is unknown but is expected to be very high. =Games played on trees= =Long games= Existence of œâ1 Woodin cardinals implies that for every countable ordinal Œ±, all games on integers of length Œ± and projective payoff are determined. Roughly speaking, Œ± Woodin cardinals corresponds to determinacy of games on reals of length Œ± (with a simple payoff set). Assuming a limit of Woodin cardinals Œ∫ with o(Œ∫)=Œ∫++ and œâ Woodin cardinals above Œ∫, games of variable countable length where the game ends as soon as its length is admissible relative to the line of play and with projective payoff are determined. Assuming that a certain iterability conjecture is provable, existence of a measurable Woodin cardinal implies determinacy of open games of length œâ1 and projective payoff. (In these games, a winning condition for the first player is triggered at a countable stage, so the payoff can be coded as a set of reals.) Relative to a Woodin limit of Woodin cardinals and a measurable above them, it is consistent that every game on integers of length œâ1 and ordinal definable payoff is determined. It is conjectured that the determinacy hypothesis is equiconsistent with a Woodin limit of Woodin cardinals. œâ1 is maximal in that there are undetermined games on integers of length œâ1+œâ and ordinal definable payoff. =Games of imperfect information= In any interesting game with imperfect information, a winning strategy will be a mixed strategy: that is, it will give some probability of differing responses to the same situation. If both players' optimal strategies are mixed strategies then the outcome of the game cannot be certainly determinant (as it can for pure strategies, since these are deterministic). But the probability distribution of outcomes to opposing mixed strategies can be calculated. A game that requires mixed strategies is defined as determined if a strategy exists that yields a minimum expected value (over possible counter-strategies) that exceeds a given value. Against this definition, all finite two-player zero-sum games are clearly determined. However, the determinacy of infinite games of imperfect information (Blackwell games) is less clear. In 1969 David Blackwell proved that some \\"infinite games with imperfect information\\" (now called \\"Blackwell games\\") are determined, and in 1998 Donald A. Martin proved that ordinary (perfect-information game) determinacy for a boldface pointclass implies Blackwell determinacy for the pointclass. This, combined with the Borel determinacy theorem of Martin, implies that all Blackwell games with Borel payoff functions are determined. Martin conjectured that ordinary determinacy and Blackwell determinacy for infinite games are equivalent in a strong sense (i.e. that Blackwell determinacy for a boldface pointclass in turn implies ordinary determinacy for that pointclass), but as of 2010, it has not been proven that Blackwell determinacy implies perfect-information-game determinacy.

The population is around 25,000. The town's population is nicknamed ≈Ωoch√°ri (sing. ≈Ωoch√°r) (producers, or owners of \\"mosses\\"). The Nitra River flows through a wide valley between the two mountain ranges that are visible from the town: Tribeƒç (to the east) and Pova≈æsk√Ω Inovec (to the west). Name The name Topoƒæƒçany was assumed to be derived from (poplar tree).Martin ≈†tef√°nik - J√°n Lukaƒçka et al. 2010, Lexik√≥n stredovek√Ωch miest na Slovensku, Historick√Ω √∫stav SAV, Bratislava, 2010, pp. 503, 360, . http://forumhistoriae.sk/-/lexikon- stredovekych-miest-na-slovensku Groves of these trees were once abundant on the banks of the Nitra River, thus the local settlers get the name *Topoƒæƒçane - \\"those who live between poplars\\". However recent studies have shown that the name is derived from the Old Slavonic word topol meaning \\"warm, hot\\", for there were hot springs in the region in early medieval times. History Founded in the 9th century, Topoƒæƒçany was a regional market centre during the Middle Ages located on the western bank of the Nitra River and on a crossroads of trade routes. Topoƒæƒçany Castle was built in the 13th century 18 km to the NW of the town; this considerable distance was due to the lowland location of Topoƒæƒçany. The castle lies on slopes of Pova≈æsk√Ω Inovec. Castle of Topoƒæƒçany During the 12th and 13th centuries, Topoƒæƒçany was owned by the Csak family, its best-known member being Matthew III Cs√°k. In the 15th century, the castle was conquered and held by the Hussites for 3 years, who returned it for a fee of 9000 ducats in 1434. In 1443 the countryside was pillaged by a rogue noble who had captured the castle, but was later evicted by the king and sent to Moravia. In the same year, and again in 1444, the town (and much of Carpathia) was struck by an earthquake. During the 16th and 17th centuries there were a few large-scale fires that destroyed substantial parts of the town. Because the town was only 60 km north of the border between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, Topoƒæƒçany was often raided by the Ottoman Turks during the Ottoman wars in Europe, notably in the years 1599 and 1643, when many citizens were taken into slavery. The town's population stagnated as a result. The town's location in a lowland thus proved a disadvantage in times of war as the town never grew big enough to erect city walls. For most of its history, Topoƒæƒçany's population was ethnically mixed. While the rural population was almost purely Slovak, the urban population consisted of Carpathian Germans, Jews, and Magyars. Jews immigrated to the town during the 16th-18th centuries. This ethnic mix came to an end in the first part of the 20th century, as industrialization attracted Slovaks from the surrounding areas and the number of Magyars decreased after the creation of Czechoslovakia following World War I. The Jewish (about 3,200 people) and German populations substantially decreased during World War II. The 550-700 Jews from Topoƒæƒçany who survived the Holocaust and returned to their homes found themselves strangers in their native town, without property and in many cases without citizenship. Because most of the Jews in Topoƒæƒçany spoke Hungarian or German, they had declared their ethnicity in the last pre-war Czechoslovak census as Magyar or German rather than Jewish or Slovak. The Bene≈° decrees after World War II expelled Hungarian and German speakers, both Jews and Christians. Additionally, most of Topoƒæƒçany's pre-war businesses had been owned by Jews, but were taken over by Slovaks during the war. The Jews that survived the war initially tried to stay and rebuild their lives, even after the Topoƒæƒçany pogrom of 24 September 1945, but by 1949 all of the remaining Jewish population emigrated. Population Topoƒæƒçany is predominantly inhabited by Slovaks, with small minorities of Romani and Hungarians. In 2004-05 there were also a number of Czechs and Poles living in the town, as Topoƒæƒçany was the host of a joint Slovak-Czech-Polish military operation intended to prepare Slovakia for joining NATO. The majority of the population is Roman Catholic (there are two churches of this denomination including one on the central square), and there are also a minority of Protestants (one church). The historic synagogue was destroyed by fire during World War II. Sights A large army barracks is located in the town; during the Communist era there were about 2,000 troops stationed in the city. The surrounding forests are full of abandoned bunkers. Industry There are four main industries in Topoƒæƒçany: the Topvar brewery (owned by SABMiller), kitchen furniture producer Decodom, cableware producer SEWS (owned by a Japanese company), and the clothing company Ozeta (producer of suits and jackets). The large \\"ZTS\\" factory, a heavy machinery producer in neighboring Tovarn√≠ky, is no longer a major employer. Education The educational infrastructure is made up of kindergartens, elementary schools, high schools (both general and specialised) and a branch of a Bratislava-based university. However, most of the town's young people go to Nitra, Bratislava, or Trnava for higher education.

Ministers who held conventicles here include Donald Cargill, Richard Cameron, Thomas Douglas and James Renwick. James Renwick (15 February 1662 ‚Äì 17 February 1688) was a Scottish minister with whose death on the scaffold, at the early age of 26, closed the sanguinary persecution directed against religious liberty in Scotland by the house of Stewart. He was born at Moniaive in Dumfriesshire on 15 of February 1662, being the son of a weaver, Andrew Renwick. Educated at Edinburgh University, he joined the section of the Covenanters known as the Cameronians about 1681 and soon became prominent among them. Afterwards he studied theology at the university of Groningen and was ordained a minister in 1683. Returning to Scotland ‚Äúfull of zeal and breathing forth threats of organized assassination,‚Äù says Mr Andrew Lang, he became one of the field-preachers and was declared a rebel by the privy council. He was largely responsible for the ‚Äúapologetical declaration‚Äù of 1684 by which he and his followers disowned the authority of Charles II.; the privy council replied by ordering every one to abjure this declaration on pain of death. Unlike some of his associates, Renwick refused to join the rising under the earl of Argyll in 1685; in 1687, when the declarations of indulgence allowed some liberty of Worship to the Presbyterians, he and his followers, often called Renwickites, continued to hold meetings in the fields, which were still illegal. A reward was offered for his capture, and early in 1688 he was seized in Edinburgh. Tried and found guilty of disowning the royal authority and other offences, he refused to apply for a pardon and was hanged on 17 of February 1688. Renwick was the last of the Covenanter martyrs. Life View of the Renwick Monument, Moniaive =Childhood= James Renwick was born at Moniaive in the Parish of Glencairn, Dumfriesshire, in 1662. Renwick's father Andrew (or in some sources, Alexander) was a weaver by trade. His mother, Elizabeth Corson, had borne several children prior to James' birth, but all had died in infancy or early childhood. The young James was credited with having an affinity for the church from a very early age. Alexander Shields (and later John Howie) wrote: :\\"By the time he was two years of age, he was observed to be aiming at prayer, even in the cradle and about it...\\" =In Edinburgh= In 1675, Andrew Renwick died and James went on to the University of Edinburgh, where he studied religion, in particular the presbyterian religion of his forefathers. In 1681, he saw several Covenanters martyred in Edinburgh, including Donald Cargill. He witnessed the execution of Donald Cargill at the cross of Edinburgh on 27 July 1681, and the spectacle determined him to cast in his lot with the adherents to the Sanquhar declaration of 22 June 1680, popularly known as Cameronians, from Richard Cameron. Accordingly, in October 1681, he organised a secret meeting of members of this party, probably a field-conventicle, and by his earnest zeal did much to rally them to renewed action. A correspondence was instituted between the Societies of sympathisers in various parts of the west of Scotland. Renwick, at Lanark, on 12 January 1682, publicly proclaimed what was known as the Lanark declaration. He was not its author (it was written on 15 December 1681), and admitted that some of its vehement language against the existing authorities (‚Äòa brothel, rather than a court‚Äô) was ill-advised. Sir Alexander Gordon of Earlston, who had been commissioned to Holland by the Societies in March 1682, made arrangements for Renwick to pursue his theological studies there, with a view to ordination. =Ordination in the Netherlands= After the martyrdom of Cargill the United Societies were without a minister, and there was no minister in Scotland whom they could acknowledge. But instead of ordaining at their own hands, they sent Renwick to Holland to get theological training from Dutch professors, and orderly instalment in the sacred office from Dutch presbyters; and from the middle of 1681 to the end of 1683, they had neither preaching nor sacraments. Shields mentions that Renwick, in the first year of his wonderful ministry, kept note of five hundred baptisms performed by him, and at that number \\"lost count.\\" Renwick spent a session at the university of Groningen, and Leeuwarden. His ordination was promoted by the interest of Sir Robert Hamilton with Brakel, a Dutch divine. Renwick objected to subscribe the Dutch formularies as inconsistent with the covenant, and was allowed to substitute a subscription to the Westminster confession and catechism. His ordination certificate is dated 9 April 1683; a day later a remonstrance reached Groningen from the Scottish ministers of Rotterdam. On 10 May he received commendatory letters from the Groningen classis, and proceeded to Briel, to embark for the return voyage. He abandoned the first ship, on which he had taken passage, on account of ‚Äòprofane passengers‚Äô pressing him to drink the king's health, and transferred himself to a vessel bound for Ireland. After some adventures he reached Dublin, where he found the nonconformist ministers very indifferent to his cause. Proceeding by sea to Scotland, he at once entered on his ministry there. =Field preacher= The Preaching Stone on Breconside Hill James Renwick's encounter with the troopers A painting showing Renwick being taken to execution in 1688 Upon his return to Scotland in 1683 he gave his first sermon, at Darmead, Cambusnethan, choosing passages from the book of Isaiah. Renwick spent the next five years travelling around Scotland ministering. His first sermon (September 1683) was in a meeting at Darmead Moss in the parish of Cambusnethan, Lanarkshire. He soon became noted as a field-preacher, and was proclaimed a rebel by the Scottish privy council. Though his fame spread, his position was variously misconstrued, some charging him with ‚Äòthe delirious and detestable blasphemies of Gib,‚Äô the reference being to John Gib, shipmaster of Borrowstounness, Linlithgowshire, who, in April 1681, had started a semi-mystical sect of ‚Äòsweet singers.‚Äô Occasionally Renwick and his followers crept into churches by night and held their meetings. In 1684 efforts were made to apprehend him. In July he was nearly taken by a party of dragoons, but escaped with the loss of his papers. Letters of intercommuning (interdiction) were issued against him on 24 September. His followers hereupon urged the defiant measure of a new declaration, to which Renwick was at first averse. But in October he drew up ‚Äòthe Apologetical Declaration‚Äô which, by concerted action, was affixed to a number of market crosses and church doors on 8 November 1684. It claimed the right of dealing with the agents of authority as enemies of God, and ‚Äòmurdering beasts of prey.‚Äô Two gentlemen of the king's lifeguards having been slain in an onset upon a field-meeting, the privy council ordered the death penalty for all who refused to disown this declaration on oath. The Scottish parliament, in April 1685, passed a statute making any acknowledgment of the covenant an act of treason. This led to the second Sanquhar declaration, promulgated by Renwick and his followers on 28 May 1685. Renwick refused to join the insurrection of 1685 under Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll. He was in sympathy with its object, but held aloof from a movement not distinctly put on the basis of the covenant. Hence he alienated many of his own party. His old friend, Sir Alexander Gordon, then a prisoner at Blackness, turned against him. He was viewed as a man who would only act by himself. Robert Cathcart, a Wigtonshire covenanter, protested against him; Alexander Peden was estranged from him, though they were reconciled on Peden's deathbed; Henry Erskine peremptorily rejected his overtures. He found associates in David Houston, a turbulent Irish covenanter (see Reid, ed. Killen, 1867, ii. 328 sq.), and Alexander Shields, his biographer. James II's Scottish proclamations of indulgence (12 Feb. and 28 June 1687) gave full liberty for presbyterians to assemble for their worship in meeting-houses or private residences, on condition of registration and taking an oath of allegiance. Field conventicles were still prohibited. The conditions were satisfactory to all but Renwick and his followers, who would acknowledge no royal prerogative of dispensation, and insisted on maintaining their field-meetings. On 5 October a proclamation ordered the utmost severity against such meetings; and on 18 October a reward of 100/. was offered to any one who would deliver up Renwick, dead or alive. His friends must have been very faithful to him, for he made his way about the country, and, narrowly escaping arrest at Peebles, reached Edinburgh, where he lodged a protest against the indulgence with Hugh Kennedy, moderator of the Edinburgh presbytery, and afterwards got it promulgated. At the end of the year he preached for several Sundays in Fifeshire; on 29 January 1688 he preached for the last time at Borrowstounness. Returning to Edinburgh, he lodged on the night of 31 January at a smuggler's receiving house on the Castlehill. A customs officer, John Justice, who was watching the house, heard him at family prayer, and suspected who it was. Next morning (1 Feb.) Justice surprised him and endeavoured to effect his arrest. Renwick defended himself with a pistol, and got away to the Castlewynd in the Cowgate, where he was seized and taken to the Tolbooth. =Trial and execution= James Renwick at the Grassmarket Martyrs' Monument, Greyfriars Kirkyard Martyrs' Monument (inscription).

Dalgarnock Churchyard Cross - mentions Renwick In 1688, he was finally captured and ordered to swear fealty to the King (James VII and II). He replied, :\\"No! I own all authority that has its prescriptions and limitations from the Word of God; but I cannot own this usurper as lawful king, seeing both by the Word of God such a one is incapable to bear rule, and also by the ancient laws of the kingdom which admit none to the Crown of Scotland until he swear to defend the Protestant Religion, which a man of his profession cannot do.\\" Graham, the captain of the guard, struck with his slight build, small stature, and youthful look, exclaimed: ‚ÄòWhat, is this the boy Renwick that the nation hath been so much troubled with?‚Äô Under examination by the privy council he concealed nothing, and made a favourable impression by his frankness and courage. He was indicted (3 Feb.) on three counts‚Äîdisowning the king's authority, maintaining the unlawfulness of paying the cess, and the lawfulness of defensive arms. Before his trial his mother and other friends were admitted to see him. On 8 February he was tried by the court of session and a jury of fifteen. The trial was conducted with unusual moderation, but Renwick's answers to interrogatories fully admitted the truth of all three charges, and he was sentenced to be hanged in the Grassmarket on 12 February. Subsequently, and contrary to his wishes, he was reprieved to 17 February. After sentence his friends were denied access to him, but he was visited by numbers of the clergy, catholic, episcopalian, and presbyterian of the moderate sort. John Paterson, archbishop of Glasgow, was frequently with him, trying hard to get him to petition for a further reprieve, which would certainly have been granted, and his life might have been saved. But Renwick was immovable in his determination to suffer for his principles; it became a proverb, ‚ÄòBegone, as Mr. Renwick said to the priests.‚Äô On 16 February he penned his dying testimony and a letter to his followers. Even on the morning of his execution he was offered his life if he would sign a petition for pardon. On the scaffold he sang a psalm, read a chapter, and prayed at length. He suffered on 17 Feb. 1688, having just completed his twenty-sixth year. He is celebrated as the last of the martyrs of the covenant, James Guthrie being one of the first. The two are thus commemorated in the inscription upon the ‚Äòmartyrs' monument‚Äô in the Greyfriars' churchyard, Edinburgh, the Westminster Abbey of Scotland: :But as for them, no cause was to be found :Worthy of death but only they were found, :Constant and steadfast, zealous witnessing :For the Prerogatives of CHRIST their KING :Which Truths were seal'd by famous Guthrie's head, :And all along to Mr. Renwick's blood, :They did endure the wrath of enemies :Reproaches, torments, deaths and injuries :But yet they're those who from such troubles came :And now triumph in glory with the LAMB. The monument marks Renwick's burial-place, being fixed to the wall close to the spot where criminals were interred. Renwick was thereupon sentenced to die by hanging. The sentence was carried out on 17 February 1688, in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh. Following his execution, Renwick's head and hands were severed and affixed to the gates of the city. Before the year was out, the Stuarts were in exile, and the persecution of Covenanters was over, although this was replaced from 1689 onwards by persecution of Episcopalians. The Covenanters saw his death as the herald of a more gracious day. \\"He was of old Knox's principles,\\" his adversaries said, when they noted his unassailable steadfastness. But we may take our farewell of him in words which were written by one who loved him dearly: \\"When I speak of him as a man, none more comely in features, none more prudent, none more heroic in spirit, yet none more meek, more humane and condescending. He learned the truth and counted the cost, and so sealed it with his blood.\\" An ‚ÄòElegie‚Äô on his death, by Shields, was published in Edinburgh, in 1688. A monument to his memory has been erected near his birthplace. Renwick seems to have published nothing, but after his death was issued ‚ÄòA Choice Collection of very valuable Prefaces, Lectures, and Sermons, preached upon the Mountains and Muirs ‚Ä¶ transcribed from several Manuscripts,‚Äô &c.; To the fourth edition (Glasgow, 1777, 8vo) were added his ‚ÄòForm and Order of Ruling Elders,‚Äô and other pieces. It may be noted that ‚Äòprefaces‚Äô are exhortations before prayer. In the John Rylands Library at Manchester is a manuscript volume containing transcripts of letters by Renwick and others, made soon after his death. Bibliography *Smellie, Rev. Alexander.

Altinum (in Altino, a frazione of Quarto d'Altino) was an ancient town of the VenetiPtolemy, Geography 3.1.30 15 km SE of modern Treviso, close to the mainland shore of the Lagoon of Venice. It was also close to the mouths of the rivers Dese, Zero and Sile. It became part of Roman Italy. It was a flourishing port and trading centre during the Roman period. It was destroyed by Attila of the Huns in 452. The town recovered, but it was later abandoned due to its area becoming covered with sand brought by the sea. Its inhabitants moved to Torcello and other islands of the northern part of the lagoon. Today Altinum is an archaeological area and has a national archaeological museum. Pre-Roman Altinum Altium was a Venetic settlement. The earliest human presence in the area is dated to the 10th century BCE and is related to hunter gatherer groups. The earliest evidence of a settlement nucleus is dated from the mid-8th century to the mid-7th century BCE. In the 7th century BCE the settlement moved slightly to the northwest, in its historical location. A sacred area which is dated to the late 6th century BCE and developed in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE had votive offering objects from Greek, Magna Graecian, Etruscan and Celtic areas.Cresci Marrone G., Tirelli M., Che cosa Sappiamo (Oggi) dell‚Äô Antica Altino, Atti, Tomo, CLXV,Classe di Scienze Morali, Lettere ed Arti, Fascicolo III, IV, 2007 This suggests that Altinum was the main port of the Veneti in the proto-historical age. Archaeology indicates that in the late 6th/early 5th century BC, the Veneti had precocious contact with Celtic areas through the communication routes along the rivers Adige and Piave in the major centres in the plain of the River Po (Este and Padua and the Adriatic ports such as Atria, modern Adria, and Altinum). There was a trading relationship between high-ranking families. There was a degree of intermarriage. Some Celts settled in the region. Celtic gift and fashion objects appear in the burials of important families.Capuis, L. L‚Äôepoca della celtizzazione, in Tirelli M., (ed.), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011, pp. 81-93 In the early 4th century BCE the Gauls invaded the plain of the Po as far as Verona. This led to a gradual ethnic mixing and loss of cultural identity, especially in the border areas of the Veneti; Verona in the west and the Lagoon of Venice and the Piave valley in the east. In some places there was at times a transition to the traditional practice of cremation to inhumation and the deposition of weapon in burials, which was an exception to Veneti funerary culture. An example of this was found in a cemetery in Altinum. Such evidence suggests that inter-ethnic relations went beyond just trade and that there were clusters of foreign settlers. Perhaps they were traders, workers and/or mercenaries. Strabo gave indications of the social, economic and ritual importance horses and horse breeding among the pre-Roman Veneti. He wrote that they bestowed attention on horse rearing ‚Äúwhich, though now entirely abandoned, was formerly in great esteem among them, resulting from the ancient rage for breeding mules, which Homer thus mentions: ‚Äú From the [Ve]neti for forest mules renowned.\\" It was here that Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, kept his stud of race-horses. And, in consequence, the [Veneti] horses were much esteemed in Greece, and their breed in great repute for a long period.‚Äù Strabo, Geography, 5.1.4 (Homer actually wrote ‚Äúwhence is the race of wild mules.‚Äù Iliad II. 857) Strabo also noted that the Veneti paid honour to Diomedes by sacrificing a white horse.Geography, 5.1.4 In Altinum there was a large number of horses buried in a sacrificial pit at the town's sanctuary and in the cemetery area to the north of the town. In the latter there were some thirty horses, whereas in other Veneti towns there were only a few, except for a cemetery exclusively devoted to some thirty horses to the south of Este. There burials are dated to the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Evidence of sacrifice at the sanctuary continues into the Roman imperial period. Here the remains of some twenty horses were found alongside those of bovines, sheep, goats and pigs. The ritual offerings were the heads or parts of hindlegs or tails which were disarticulated, skinned and fleshed. Sketches of headless horses or body parts confirm this animal's key role in religious cults.Gambacurta G., Altino preromana (VIII-IV secolo a. C), in Tirelli M. Altino antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011 p.59, 72 Roman Altinum Archaeological finds indicate that Altinum's perimeter was marked by waterways beyond which there were cemetery areas. The abundance of watercourses gives the picture of a town deeply tied to water which was characteristic of towns in the Veneto. The transformation of Altinum from a Veneti to a Roman town started with the reorganisation of its marshy environment through the regulation of its waters and the expansion of its canal network. The main work was the digging of the Silocello canal to link the River Sile (which was to the north of the town) to the channel which today is called Santa Maria and which flowed to the south of the town from the River Dese to the lagoon. The most important architectural finds are a town gate on the canal which marked the northern edge of the town, another public building which faced the canal which marked the southern edge of the town and a temple close to the Santa Maria channel which was restructured in a monumental form from a 5th-century BCE wooden structure. (See the \\"Port and canals\\" section for Altinum's canals) In 225 the Veneti and Romans established an alliance treaty in the run up of the Battle of Telamon between Rome and an alliance between the Insubres and Boii Gallic tribes of northern Italy and Gaesatae mercenaries. The foundation of the colony of Aquileia, in Celtic territory, as a fortress to protect northern Italy form invasions from the northeast and east was an important moment in the process of Romanisation of the Veneti and Altinum, which is traceable to the first half of the 2nd century BCE. Altinum came to be half way port and stopover between Ravenna and the new and important colony. Its port grew in size. This was also due to the Romans promoting sea trade in the upper Adriatic SeaTirelli M., Il Porto di Altinum The process of Romanisation was in part driven by the presence of Roman, Latin and Italic merchants attracted to this port by lucrative trade. Inscriptions attest an early presence the Publicia, Barbia, Cossutia and Saufeia families in Aquileia and Virunum (modern Magdalensberg), a town in Noricum (in present-day Austria) were there was iron mining. These were families of equite rank (the Roman entrepreneurial class). They went to Aquileia from central Italy and form there they spread to the northern markets, including Altinum. Sometime between 153 and 131 BCE the Via Annia was built. It connected Atria (modern Adria) to Aquileia. It passed through Patavium (Padua) and then it run close to the coast and passed through Altinum. In 131 BC the Via Popilia, which connected Ariminum (modern Rimini), Ravenna and Atria, was built. Thus, Altinum came to be connected overland to these important towns, facilitating the movement of goods. Again, its port increased in importance.Cresci Marrone G., La Romanizzazione (seconda met√† III - met√† I secolo a.c.) in Tirelli M, (ed.), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011 p. 95 Its inhabitants were granted Latin rights, a limited form of Roman citizenship, in 89 BCE and in the last decades of the Roman Republic, in 49 BCE, they acquired full Roman citizenship and were assigned to the Scaptia Roman tribe The town became a municipium, probably in 42-40 BCE.Cresci Marrone G., La voce degli antichi in Tirelli M., (ed.) Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011, pp. 34, 37] Velleius Paterculus wrote than in the run up to the final civil war of the Roman Republic (32-30 BCE) between Octavian (later known as emperor Augustus) and Mark Antony, Pollio Asinius, kept Venetia under Mark Antony's control for a long time with his seven legions and accomplished brilliant things near Altinum and other towns in the region. He then joined Mark Antony.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.76.2 This was in 42-40 BCE. Pollio Asinius was either the last governor or the Venetia region of Roman Italy or a member of a commission charged with distributing land to war veterans. With his legions he was able was able to give the towns in Venetia administrative autonomy by giving them the status of municipium without much trouble. It is likely that by saying that Pollio Asinus accomplished brilliant things, Velleius Paterculus was referring to Asinius allocating land to veterans near Altinum and Patavium and founding the colony of Iula Concordia (modern Oderzo) which Julius Caesar hand probably planned but not accomplished. Sometime between 31 and 12 BCE, Octavian established Ravenna's harbour as one of the home ports for his new navy.Mauskopf Deliyannis, D., Ravenna in Late Antiquity, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 26; It became one of the main Roman military ports and this favoured Altinum as it increased the importance of the upper Adriatic Sea. The town benefitted from infrastructure commissioned by the emperor Claudius. In 46 CE he opened a branch of the Via Claudia Augusta from Altinum to Tridentum (today's Trento) in the Italian Alps. Drusus had started its construction in 15 AD. It connected Hostiglia (today's Ostiglia), on the River Po, to the \\"limes\\" at the Danube in southern Germany via Tridentum. Claudius also build a road along the coast which connected Altinum to Atria directly. He also extended the navigable route inside the Septem Maria lagoons,Septem Maria William Smith (ed.), Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) to Altinum with the construction of a further canal, the fossa Clodia, thus connecting it to Ravenna. Although this internal route only allowed navigation by smaller vessels, it guaranteed communication even through the worse weather. This enhanced Altinum's strategic and commercial importance as a hub for trade between the Mediterranean Sea, north-eastern Italy and beyond the Alps. During the civil wars which followed the death of the emperor Nero (see Year of the four emperors, 69 AD), Marcus Antonius Primus, who supported Vespasian's bid to depose Vitellius, advanced into Italy with his troops. Tacitus wrote that he occupied Aquileia and then he was \\"received with joy\\" at Opitergium (Oderzo) and Altinum and that a military contingent was left in Altinum in case of an attack by the fleet in Ravenna.Tacitus, Histories, 3.6 In 169, during the Marcomannic Wars (166-180 AD) the co-emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus were returning to Rome from the front in Pannonia. Lucius Verus was said to have been hit by apoplexy near Altinum. He got off his carriage bleeding and was taken to Altinum, where he died after three days of not been able to speak.Historia Augusta, The Live of Lucius Verus, p.7 Some modern scholars believe that he may have been a victim of the Antonine Plague.Birley, A. R., Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, Routledge, 2 edition,1993, pp. 194-97; By the 4th century CE Altinum became the seat of a bishopric. The first bishop was Heliodorus of Altino (died c. 410), He accompanied St Jerome in his first trip to the East. When he returned he became the bishop of Altinum and attended the 381 CE anti-Arian Council of Aquileia in that capacity.Santi Beati Saint Jerome wrote letters to Heliodorus and his nephew Nepotianus, a priest. In a consolatory letter written to Heliodorus when Nepotianus died in 396, he mentioned that Altinum had many churches and martyr shrines and that the Nepotianus presbytery was adorned with flowers of all types, twigs and vine leaves. The cathedral (built in by 381) had two entrances shaded by curtains. It had an altar, shiny floors, walls which were not covered by smoke and an ancillary space related to the sacristy.St. Jerome, letters, 60.12 St Jerome described Altinum as \\"a populous centre whose buildings were close to each other and many hearths which darkened the air with thick smog.\\"St. Jerome, Letters, 14.10 Today Altinum is no longer a residential diocese. It is listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 830 The Apex of Altinum's flourishing period was from the 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE. Its size was comparable to that of Pompeii. A decrease in archaeological finds suggests that after this, Altinum, like the other towns in the Veneto region, begun to decline.Tirelli, M., Altino, in Blason Scarel S., (ed.), Attila e gli Unni: Mostra Itinerante (Cataloghi Mostre), L'Erma Di Bretschneider, 1995, pp. 50-52 However, it retained a prominent role. The Codex Theodosianus (Theodosian Code), a compilation of Roman laws under the Christian emperors from 312 to the 430s commissioned was by Theodosius II and Valentinian III in 429 and published in 438,records sixteen laws that were issued by emperors in Altinum, especially between 364 and 399. It also provides evidence that emperors in the second half of the 4th century often stayed in this town and that the imperial chancellery regularly worked there between 364 and 406.Sperti L., Cipriano S., Paveggio A., Delpozzo E., Altinum discovering a hidden municipium through GIS, historical research and new excavations, Proceedings 12th ICA Conference Digital Approaches to Cartographic Heritage, Venice, 26-28 April 2017 An early 5th century revision of the Tabula Peutingeriana, an illustrated itinerarium of the Roman Empire, had a symbol depicting Altinum as a town with two towers,Tabula Peutingeriana, Altino which represented it as an important and populous town. Possenti L. L‚Äô et√† tardoantica e medievale (IV secolo d.C-639 d.C) in Tirelli M., (ed.), Altino antica, dai veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011, p. 173 Altinum and other towns and villages in the region were destroyed in 452 by Attila the Hun.De Gallia Ab Anonymo Ravennate Descripta Disseruit, Tabulamgue Addidit, Nabu Press, 2011; According to the Chronicon Venetum et Gradense, the earliest Venetian chronicle, written by John the deacon in the mid- 10th and early 11th century, refugees from Altinum fled to Torcello and other islands in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice. Some of the inhabitants of these islands moved the island group of Rivo alto, in the central part of the lagoon, 450‚Äì500 years later and contributed to the development of a new city, Venice. Thus, according to the tradition, which is still deeply ingrained, the origins of Venice are related to the destruction of Altinum by Attila, its demise and the refugees who fled from this town. The invasion of northern Italy by the Lombards in 568, which spared the lagoons of the north-western coast of Italy, which were under Byzantine influence, has also been held responsible for this demise. The implicit assumption is that this gave a final blow to the remnants of the town. However, archaeological investigations have disproved this notion. Although Attila's actions may well have further contributed to the decline of the town, Altinum overcame this and continued to exist for several centuries. The features of the coast of north-eastern Italy were changing. The Altinum area slowly became covered by sand brought by the sea which turned into mud, starting from the Roman imperial period. Generally, the inland Roman towns, from Grado to Ravenna, were becoming less and less suited as ports. There was a shift from single ports controlled by the imperial authorities to peripheral ports in satellite areas along new river routes most probably controlled by new investors and ship owners. Trade moved these places. In the case of Altinum it moved to Torcello, which was on a fluvial channel through the lagoon which led to the open sea. Archaeological excavations in the inland towns and the lagoons have not revealed any sudden population movements and sharp population increases in the satellite ports or in Torcello as could be expected with an influx of refugees. The finds show that there was a gradual colonisation of the lagoons, a slow shift over centuries which had already started in the Roman days.Calaon D., Quando Torcello Era Abitata (When Torcello was inhabited), Regione del Veneto, 2013. With English translationCalaon D., Late Antiquity and Early Middle ages: warehouses, elites, and settlements, in Balliana E., Bernardi A., Biscontin G., Calaon D., Falchi L., Frigatti C., Izzo F. C., Longega G., Malaguti C., Marcanti A., Melotti E., Povolo C., Prezioso A., Savcic B., Scantamburlo C., Scatto D., Sgobbi M., Vidal D., Zendri E., Excavated Torcello, a shared heritage. With English translation Besides the slowly developing troubles of the inland ports, the trend was also favoured by economic changes and new economic opportunities, such as fish farming and salt production. Agriculture played a secondary but fundamental role in favouring new stable settlements through intensive cultivation of limited land areas, which were probably uncultivated. If so, they could be used by military elites who had the means for productive and, above all, infrastructural investment. In Torcello, embankments were built to protect the island. Mooring facilities and warehouses were built to service sea trade. Calaon argues that archaeology shows that the bishop of Torcello, a landowning aristocrat, built his church in Torcello \\"not so much because he feared barbarian raids, but because he had made a strategic choice. He chose to place his see in a peripheral but flourishing district, perhaps one of the most populous of the whole countryside.\\" After the fall of the western part of the Roman Empire (conventional date 476 BCE), the Ostrogoths invaded Italy and established the Gothic Kingdom (493‚Äì553). The Byzantine emperor Justinian I (527-565) decided to annex Italy to the Byzantine Empire. This led to the Gothic War (535‚Äì554) between the Byzantines and the Ostrogoths, which was won by the former. Byzantine rule in northern Italy was short-lived as the Lombards invaded northern Italy (568-73) except for the lagoons of north-eastern coast of Italy. Altinum eventually came under the duchy of Treviso of the Kingdom of the Lombards (568‚Äì774). Narses, the Byzantine military commander in Italy in the final stage of the Gothic War, managed to capture Vitale, the bishop of Altinum, which many years earlier had taken refuge in Auguntum in Noricum, near modern Lienz Historia Latina, 2.4 If there had been a partial withdrawal by Altinum's top clergy, this would have been during Gothic Wars. Paul the Deacon, the Lombard historian, wrote that the bishop of Altinum took part in the synod of Marano (590) during the Schism of the Three Chapters (553-698). A 590 letter the Byzantine commander in Altinum wrote to Childebert I, one of the kings of the Franks, attests that Altinum still had town walls.Sartor I., Altino mmedievale e moderna, Dosson, (Treviso), 1990, p. 48 The move of the bishop of Torcello is assigned to the 5th century or within the 7th century. However, it followed a long and tortuous course which ended for good in the early 11th century. Mentions by ancient writers Marcus Valerius Martialis (Martial), the 1st century poet, wrote: \\"You banks of Altinum, that rival the rural beauties of Baiae, ‚Ä¶ and you, Aquileia ‚Ä¶ You shall be the haven and the resting-places of my old age, if my retirement be at my own disposal.\\"Martial, Epigrams, 4.25.1 Baiae was a popular seaside resort in the Bay of Naples which was very fashionable among rich Romans. Strabo, the 1st century BCE geographer, gave a description of northern Italy and the Veneto, \\"The whole of this country is full of rivers and marshes, especially the district of the Veneti, which likewise experiences the tides of the sea. This is almost the only part of our sea [The Mediterranean] which is influenced in the same manner as the ocean, and, like it, has ebb and flood tides. In consequence most of the plain is covered with lagoons. The inhabitants have dug canals and dikes, after the manner of Lower Egypt, so that part of the country is drained and cultivated, and the rest is navigable. Some of their cities stand in the midst of water like islands, others are only partially surrounded. Such as lie above the marshes in the interior are situated on [navigable rivers] ‚Ä¶. continually swelled by the rains and snows.\\"Strabo, Geography, 5.1 5 Strabo also described Ravenna and Altinum, \\"Situated in the marshes is the great [city of] Ravenna, built entirely on piles, and traversed by canals, which you cross by bridges or ferry-boats. At the full tides it is washed by a considerable quantity of sea-water, as well as by the river, and thus the sewage is carried off, and the air purified ‚Ä¶ It is a remarkable peculiarity of this place, that, though situated in the midst of a marsh, the air is perfectly innocuous ‚Ä¶ Another remarkable peculiarity is that of its vines, which, though growing in the marshes, make very quickly and yield a large amount of fruit, but perish in four or five years. Altinum stands likewise in the marshes, its situation being very similar to that of Ravenna.\\"Strabo, Geography, 5.1.7 In his description of the Veneto Region, Pliny the Elder, the 1st century BCE and CE naturalist, wrote that the River Sile flows from the hills of Treviso to Altinum.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 3.6.119 or 3.20.16 (John Bostock edition) Regarding the River Po, he wrote, \\"There is no river known to receive a larger increase than this in so short a space; so much so indeed that it is impelled onwards by this vast body of water, and, invading the land, forms deep channels in its course: hence it is that, although a portion of its stream is drawn off by rivers and canals between Ravenna and Altinum, for a space of 120 [Roman] miles, still, at the spot where it discharges the vast body of its waters, it is said to form seven seas ‚Ä¶ and ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe next mouth [of the Po] ‚Ä¶ the [Etruscans] formerly made from Sagis, thus drawing the impetuous stream of the river across into the marshes of the Atriani, which they call the Seven Seas; and upon which is the noble port of Atria ‚Ä¶‚Äù Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 3.7.126 or 3.22 (John Bostock edition) By invading the land Pliny meant floods. The seven seas (Septem Maria) was the series of lagoons which the emperor Clausius connected to Altinum (see above). Atria is now modern Adria. Vitruvius, the 1st century BCE Roman architect, wrote about laying out the ground in marsh areas. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ if in marshes walls are laid out, and these marshes are along the sea, and they look towards the north or between the north and east, and these marshes are higher than the sea coast, they will seem to be reasonably laid out. For if dykes are cut, there is made an outlet of water to the beach; and when the sea is swollen by storms, there is an overflow into the marshes, which being stirred and moved about and mixed with sea salt, does not permit the various kind of marsh creatures to be born there: moreover, those which, by swimming from higher parts, arrive near the coast, are killed by the unfamiliar saltness. An instance of this may be found in the Gallic marshes which are round Altinum, Ravenna, Aquileia and other townships in like places which are nearest the marshes. For owing to these causes, they have an incredible salubrity.‚Äù Vitruvius, De Architectura, 1.4.11 This description fits the walls and canals system of Altinum. In his Commentary on the Georgics of Virgil, Maurus Servius Honoratus, a grammarian (floruit late 4th century), wrote this about the lintres (small flat-bottomed boats): \\"Lintres: small river vessels. It is not without reason that [Virgil] remembers the lintres, because in most of Venetia, rich in rivers, every trade is carried out on lintres, such as in Ravenna and Altinum, where even hunting, fowling and the cultivation of the fields are carried out in the litres.\\"Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentary on the Georgics of Vergil, 1.262 Grattius Faliscus (63 BC ‚Äì 14 AD) a poet known for his Cynegeticon, a poem on hunting, wrote about types of woods to be used for hunting. He mentioned the pine wood and the broom from Altinum.Grattius. Cynegeticon. 130-34 Broom was used to make arrows. Regarding the Pectine nigerrimi cockles, Pliny the Elder wrote, \\"the pectine, the biggest ones and among them those more black in the summer are the most they are found at Mytilene, Tindari, Salona, Altinum ‚Ä¶‚Äù Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 32. 150 In his treatise on agriculture (De Re Rustica), Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella (4-70 CE) wrote, ‚ÄúFor this use it is better to procure cows from Altinum, which the people of the area call ‚ÄúCeve‚Äù. They are short and produce a great abundance of milk, it is for this reason that this breed is bred ...‚ÄùLucius Junius Moderatus Columella, De Re Rustica, 6.24.5 He also wrote that while previous generations of farmers considered sheep from Calabria, Apulia and Mileto to be the best, in his days ‚Äùthe breed form Gallia [northern Italy] best is considered the most valuable one, especially the one from Altinum.‚ÄùLucius Junius Moderatus Columella, De Re Rustica, 7.2.3 Sheep grazing was important in the Roman days as people wore woollen clothes. Regarding white wool, Martial wrote, \\"Apulia is noted for fleeces of the first quality; Parma for those of the second. The sheep whose wool is of the third quality distinguishes Altinum.\\"Martial, Epigrams, 14.155 Tertullian 155 ‚Äì c. 240? BCE) mentioned \\"... the sheep of Mileto, Selegas, Altinum, or those for which Tarentum or Baetica are renowned, because the nature of those places gives colour to the wool.\\"Tertullian, De Palio 3-5 The 301 Edict on Maximum Prices issued by the emperor Diocletian assigned the wool of Altinum a rather high price (200 denarii per pound). It also assigned a pay of 30 denarii per pound to the workers who made wool in Tarentum, Laodicea and Altinum. Medieval history By the 10th century, the area of Altinum was totally abandoned. The bishop of Altinum moved to the island of Torcello (see above). The bishops of Torcello stressed their Altinum lineage and retained the juridical title of bishop of Altinum for centuries. The monks of the monastery of Santo Stefano moved to the Tumba Leseda island (nowadays it is called La Salina) in the archipelago of the settlement of Ammiana in 900. They established the monastery of Santi Felice e Fortunato.Rando D., Una chiesa di frontiera, le istituzioni ecclesiastiche veneziane nei secoli VI-XII,1994, Il Mulino, 1994 p. 94; Both settlements were in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice. Documentation about the area in this period is scant and comes mostly from ecclesiastic institutions (the monasteries of Santi Felice e Fortunato and of San Giorgio Maggiore and the bishop of Torcello) or to families which owned land in the area (the Carbonara, Collalto, Marcello and Querini). A 1095 text attested the existence of an Altino Maiore and an Altino Pitulo, which indicates that there was still a village and that it may have split into two parts. The text also indicates that the churches of Santa Maria (the old cathedral), San Martino e Sant'Apollinare still existed.Lanfranchi L., Zille G., Il territorio del Ducato Veneziano dall'VIII al XII secolo, in Storia di Venezia, Vol. 2, Venezia, International Centre of Arts and Costume, 1958, pp. 21-22. In 1388 when the Republic of Venice annexed the Treviso area, which reached the mainland shore of the Lagoon of Venice, wealthy Venetians founded an agricultural village close to the shore and to the site of Altinum. It was named San Michele del Quarto after a small church which was four Roman miles from Altinum. Despoliation of the town After Altinum was abandoned there was a gradual despoliation of its buildings and cemetery stones for use as building materials in Torcello and other islands in the lagoon and in the future Venice because there was a lack of building materials in the lagoon. The 16th century humanists and subsequent antiquarians and scholars traced some of the stones from Altinum through the search of inscriptions from the Roman age. In the second half of the 19th century Theodor Mommsen aimed at cataloguing the entire body of Latin epigraphy in Venice. Under the Altinum entry he collected and translated 181 inscriptions. Many were of uncertain provenance and only a small part is securely identifiable. Archaeological and remote sensing studies Archaeological studies started to develop mainly after the draining of this marsh area in the early 20th century. Altinum is the only large Roman town in Northern Italy and one of the few in Europe where medieval towns were not built on top of them. This makes archaeological research easier and allows remote sensing surveys to be carried out. The finds of flint artefacts attributable to the sauveterrian culture have revealed the presence of hunter gatherer groups in 9500-6500 BCE. The wetland environment, which was rich in vegetation due to water courses fed by melting ices and springs in the plain made up for the survival difficulties created by the hot and arid climate of the late boreal age. The finds of shells and sea molluscs suggest the use of food resources of the coastal environment. In those days the Lagoon of Venice had not formed yet and the coastline was a few kilometres further inland than it is now. Human presence in the areas by the Adriatic coast continued in the subsequent millennia with late Mesolithic (6,500-5,500 BCE) hunter-gatherer groups.Bianchin Citton E., La fine dei tempi preistorici, in Tirelli M., (ed), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011, pp. 47-49 An early Neolithic site of farmers and grazers with artefacts typical of the cultures of central-northern Italy of this time has been found in the nearby Tessera. In Altinum artefacts dating from the Neolithic to the early Copper Age have been found. Starting from the mid-Bronze Age (1600 BCE), there was a colonisation of the pain of the River Po and central-eastern Veneto. A late Bronze Age (1300-1000 BCE) subapennine culture (1350-1150 BCE) site has been found to the northeast of Altinum. There have been finds dated to this period on the Siloncello canal very close to Altinum (to the northeast) and in the town. A settlement on sandy mounds close to the River Sile was abandoned in the early Bronze Age due to marine ingression. Aegean pottery was found on the islands of Torcello and Mazzorbo. These were probably along a sea trade route form the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean to the Altinum area between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE. This route continued to be used in the Iron Age, as attested by the finds of Attic pottery in these two islands and other islands in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice (San Tommaso dei Bognomi, San Giacomo in Paludo, Vignole and Sant'Erasmo).Bianchin Citton E., Il Veneto tra Bronzo recente e Bronzo finale: popolamento e aspetti socio- economici di un aria di cerniera tra l‚ÄôAdriatico e l‚Äôoltralpe in Dall‚ÄôEgeo all‚Äô Adriatico: organizzazioni sociali, modi di scambio e interazione in et√† postpalaziale (XII-XI sec. a. C); Atti del Seminario Internazionale, Udine 2006, Quasar, 2009, pp. 257-71; . Text in English and Italia A land path with a fort equipped with wooden elements has also been traced Ca‚Äô Tron and Portegrandi, to the northeast of Altinum. It preceded the via Annia. It might have connected these two coastal centres to other coastal centres on the Adriatic Sea from the 11th century on and to the inland centres and the Alps via the rivers Sile and Piave. For information related to Altinum's contacts with Celtic groups see the Pre-Roman Altinum section above. Until the 1990s it was thought that the origins of Altinum were dated to the 7th century BCE. More recently, a burial attributable to the late Bronze Age was found. It was contemporary to other materials found in the nearby areas (by the River Zero, close to the coast of the lagoon and to the east). This has led to the hypothesis that the earliest protohistoric settlement nucleus was close to the Santa Maria channel (see below). The earliest trace of human activity in Altinum is datable to the first half of the 8th century BCE. It is a simple quarry for fictileFictile Wiktionary materials similar to those found in other Veneti centres dated to a slightly earlier time. The quarry was later filled in by a settlement centred around a large building (13 m long and 6.75 m wide) with two internal asymmetric spans which must have supported a double pitched roof. Soon afterwards the narrower side was widened with a portico. It was active in the second half of the 8th century BCE and was abandoned in the first quarter of the 7th century BCE. It is one of the oldest attestations of square plan buildings in the Veneto. It is derived from housing and productive prototypes found in Treviso, Oderzo and Concordia Sagittaria. In the next phase, after a brief period of abandonment, the site seems to have changed to a workshop area. There was a wooden well connected to a small canal system and a small furnace until the mid-7th century BCE. Thus, the earliest evidence of a settlement nucleus is dated from the mid-8th century to the mid-7th century BCE. Then the area was briefly unused before it was devoted to a sacred area. In the 7th century BCE the settlement moved slightly to the northwest, in its historical location. This is attested by aerial photography, stratigraphy and sample excavations below the ruins of the Roman town. It was on a man-made mound. Two sacred areas have been found in diametrically opposite locations to the north and to the south of the settlement. The first one was identified indirectly through the find of a fragment of an altar with an inscription dedicated to the god Belatukadro. The second one was found during the restructuring works of the museum area and was excavated from 1997 to 2000. It is dated to the late 6th century BCE and developed in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. Dedicative inscriptions in Venetic language and alphabet indicate that it was dedicated to Arno or Altinum, a god of the Veneti. Thus, the town was named after this god. It had a commercial role, the protection of the trade in local agricultural and manufacturing goods and horses and the imports from the Mediterranean Sea and form beyond the Alps. This is indicated by its location by the Santa Maria channel which connected it to the lagoon. Moreover, its votive deposits which had objects from Greece, Magna Graecia and the Etruscans in the plain of the River Po. Its function as an emporium is shown by inscriptions. These also show a male and military character due to the need to protect the traded goods. It was one of the main pre-Roman sanctuaries in the region. In the 5th century BCE this sanctuary was a large outdoors space enclosed by a rectangular portico which had two symmetric cells at the centre of its short sides. Two large ash altars were found inside the courtyard and in parallel with the cells. The deposit pits with the sacrificial remains and the votive objects were found outside this area. The remains of many horses were found in a pit at the edge of the sanctuary. The sacred area progressively grew until Romanisation (2nd-1st century BCE). This denotes an increase in the number of pilgrims as the town's trade in the Adriatic Sea increased. In the second half of the 1st century BCE the sanctuary came to be devoted to the Roman god Jupiter and assumed the look of a sacred wood.Cipriano S, Tirelli M, Larea sacra in Era Romana, in Cresci Marrone G., Tirelli M., (eds), Altinoi, Il Santuario altinate: Strutture del sacro a confronto dei luoghi di culto lungo la via Annia, Atti del Convegno, (Venezia, 4-6 dicembre 2006), Studi e ricerche sulla Gallia Cisalpina, Quasar, Roma, 2009, pp. 61-80; Stratigraphy related to the late Bronze Age and the transition to the Iron Age was found to the south-east of the town in the late 1990s and further out to the north-east, close to the River Sile, in 2005. In 2002 tombs datable to the late 6th- early 5th century BCE were found at the eastern edge of the town and to its north, by the River Zero. They were related to a cemetery investigated in the late 1970s. The pre-Roman cemetery area to the north of Altinum covered the whole of the northern strip which was later crossed by the northern tract of the Via Annia and the Roman period cemetery. It stretched to the left bank of the River Zero. This arrangement of cemetery areas at the edge of a town and separated by watercourses was typical of other pre-Roman Veneti towns, such as Este and Padua. It can be surmised that watercourses had a particular role in funerary ceremonies and represented a route from the town of the living to that of the dead and a transition to the afterlife. In 1999-2002 ditches and cemetery areas were found in a section of the Via Annia to the south-west of Altinum. Their dating is problematic as the road was progressively widened until it reached a width of 12 m. In the area of the Via Claudia Augusta, to the north-west of the town, there were traces of ditches and small canals attributable to a late antiquity systematic parcelling out of land and maintenance interventions. Larger areas of land divisions were noted in the mentioned areas to the south-west which was linked to a network of ditches and canals. Similar traces were found to the south and further away from the town (5 km), close to the edge of the lagoon, within the current airport area, and to the north-east, at Portegrandi, close to the edge of the lagoon. Excavations in the centre of the town in 1995-97 identified a large baths complex dated between the 1st and 3rd century. In the early 1990s an investigation of the layer below a town gate on a canal pushed back its dating, which was previously attributed to the Augustan period, to the first half of the 1st century BCE and brought to light the remains of an imposing foundation ceremony. The ancient bed of a navigable canal with moorings which was an extension of the Siloncello canal (see below) was discovered in the layers below the area of the Augustan period. It traced back the creation of a systematic hydraulic plan of remediation for the delicate ecosystem by the lagoon to the first half of the 1st century BCE. A 2000 systematic excavation of the cemeteries found a more than 2000 tombs and an extraordinary number of funerary monuments, which makes Altinum a prime site for the study of funerary architecture and rituals in northern Italy in the Roman imperial period. The Augustan period was a period of big mausolea especially for those of the baldachin type which was derived from Aegean-Oriental models. Several sumptuous examples were found in the monumental cemetery by the Via Annia where the ruling elite started to build their grandiose burials in the last decades of the 1st century BCE. In the 1st century CE they were replaced by numerous funerary enclosures along both fronts of this cemetery. They were sometimes aligned close to each over a length of over 170 m with mausolea alternating with various types of funerary buildings and areas taken up only by tombs. Cylindrical and octagonal altars typical of Altinum's sculptural art were a recurrent decorative element in the enclosures. They were probably placed in pairs at their corners. The southern tract of the Siloncello canal (see below) was blocked in the last decades of the 1st century CE to start the eastern expansion of the town. This is attested by the urban plan of the new Augustan neighbourhood. In 2007 a team of geomorphologists from the University of Padua carried out a survey with visible and near-infrared (NIR) aerial photographs which were taken after a period of prolonged drought and developed a digital elevation model (DEM) to reconstruct the urban topography and the environmental setting of Altinum. NIR is highly sensitive to vegetation and crop marks highlight archaeological features. The crops were suffering from drought and were highly sensitive to the subsurface presence of stones, bricks or compacted soil. They were in different stages of ripening due to differences in the amount of water in the soil. This created lighter crop marks which indicated stonework and revealed the outlines of buildings at least 40 cm below the surface. Darker marks indicated depressed features such as ditches and canals. To the south of the town centre there was a wide strip of riper crops which were growing above what used to be a canal. The survey covered an area of 100 hectares.Excerpts from a Times article The map of the town was reconstructed in great detail, revealing the urban fabric and the waterways, the town walls and gates, the street network and previously unknown neighbourhoods and buildings, including monumental ones: the amphitheatre, the theatre, the odeon, and the forum, which are attributable to the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. The town was on top of a 2- to 3 m-high mound and in Roman times the lagoon shore probably reached the foot that mound. Altinum was probably partially surrounded by water. The researchers conclude that the results indicate a complex urban system \\"adapted to the peculiarity of the lagoon environment\\" and show that \\"the Romans successfully exploited the amphibious environment several centuries before the city of Venice started to emerge.\\" Ninfo A., Fontana., Mozzi P, Ferrarese F., The Map of Altinum, Ancestor of Venice, Science, Vol 325, 31 July 2009, pp. 577-62 The map of Altinum which was reconstructed through remote sensing can be seen overlaid on Google Earth.Google Earth The political and administrative heart of the town was in the northernmost part. Here, besides the outlines of the forum, amphitheatre, theatre and odeon, the outlines of the capitolium (the temple of the Capitoline Triad) and the basilica were also identified in the 2007 remote sensing survey. The theatre had a length of 120 m and a radius of 60 m. It is dated between 40 and 20 BCE. It was one of the first ones in northern Italy and one of the first in a provincial town in the whole of Italy. The odeon was half its size. The amphitheatre was in the outskirts, to the north of the canal which marked the northern limit of the town. Its longer axis was 150 m and its size was similar to that of the Arena di Verona (which could host 30,000 people) and was larger than those of Padua and Aquileia. Between 2012 and 2015 Ca' Foscari University of Venice carried out surveys in an area in the east of the town, where a 2000 a geophysical survey indicated an urban area, roads and a building with an apse which correspond to the area of the late Republic monumental town gate. In the 2007 survey it came out blurred. Between 1989 and 1990 there was a geophysical survey in this area and the one next to it to the east. A series of plinths along the main canal and a secondary canal which branches from it were identified. This tallies with some 1972 samplings on the eastern bank of the secondary canal which found the foundations of a brick quay resting on wooden piling and seven rectangular plinths related to a big building which is identified as a warehouse. This suggests that it was a commercial area.Cipriano S., Il progetto Altino 2012-2015: il survey in localit√† Ghiacciaia, in Sperti L, Silvia Cipriano S., Monica Pagan M., in Ricerche e studi ad Altino e nei Musei archeologici del Veneto,Giornata dell‚Äôarcheologia: scavi e ricerche del Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici, Universit√† Ca' Foscari, 2016, pp.74-79 In 2012 just under half of the area was surveyed. It focused on surface finds (at a depth of 20‚Äì30 cm). The area ad been devoted to medicinal plants for years and had not been ploughed. It was on a marked mound. Pottery and architectural fragments, coins, fictile materials and other items were found. High concentrations of plaster, mosaic tesserae and architectural and stone fragments indicate that there were buildings. The 2014 campaign covered the rest of the area and used the same methods. Electromagnetic prospections detected three northeast‚Äìsouthwest parallel gravel roads with an average length of c. 7 m and a road perpendicular to them along the northern edge of the area, which was parallel to the canal which marks the northern end of the town. Another structure with the same orientation was detected in central area of the survey, but gravel was not detected and it might have been a canal. The finds of some concentrations of glass leftovers and fragments of a crucible suggest that there were glassworks. This is an important find because it could confirm the hypothesis that Altinum had a role in glass production in the Roman days. The port and the canals The networks of ditches and canals discovered to the northwest, southwest and south of Altinum, the canals in the town and the canals which connected the town to the lagoon show that Altinum needed to both connect its port to the lagoon and to create a hydraulic system to manage the delicate hydraulic and environmental setting of the marshy area it was in. This shaped the geomorphology of the town. Vitruvius gave some indication of the management needs in marshy areas, including Altinum, and Strabo indicated that the town had a system of canals (see above). Altinum was successful in managing its often waterlogged marshy environment. Altinum was crossed in the middle by a west‚Äìeast main canal. An oblong semi-circular canal marked the northern limit of the central part of the town and a southern one marked the southern limit. These three canals reached the River Zero, to the west of the town. The Siloncello canal, which still exists, run in a northeast‚Äìsouthwest oblique straight line form the River Sile. It came close to the north-eastern edge of the town. A southward extension of this canal was connected to the three mentioned canals. It continued to south of the town and reached the Santa Maria canal, which still exists and runs south of the town from the River Dese to the lagoon at the Palude di Cona marsh and thus connected the port, which was to the east of the extension canal, to the lagoon. The Siloncello canal turns east at a right angle just before the town and then south, reaching the Palude di Cona slightly further east. Thus, the port could be reached through the Siloncello form the east and the Santa Maria form the west.Tirelli M., Il Porto di Altino The Siloncello canal also continued eastwards and reached the River Sile, close to its mouth. At the time the River Piave must have flowed into the Sile. The Piave was a preferred route for the transport of wood from the forests of Cadore towards Altinum as attested by an inscription found in Feltre. Thus, this canal was of strategic importance for the supply of wood. The remains of a 192 m long mooring dock on the western bank of the Siloncello was found in 1930 a few hundreds of metres north of the town. A fluvial dock area found between 1988 and 1993 on the west bank of a north‚Äìsouth canal that was aligned to the Siloncello canal. It had porticoed warehouses. The dock and the canal bed were below the urban structures of the Augustan period urban period. In this period the canal was filled in. A monumental town gate was built following the model of urban gates with a central body and angular towers. It has been dated to the first half of the 1st century BCE. It was richly decorated. The central body with the gate had two towers at each side. The structure was flanked on both sides by two short wall tracts attached to the towers. It rested on strong pilings made with oak trunks. It was on the canal that marked the northern boundary of the town. The canal was crossed, perhaps through two arches, by the cardus maximus. This canal is now only a ditch. It was shown in a 16th-century map. It still had a considerable width, was visible and reached the River Zero in the late 19th century. It was the preferred route to take goods from the port to some presumed moorings at the northern border of the town and to the beginning of the Via Claudia Augusta. In 1972 the foundation of a 16.3 m brick dock with fully curved arches linked to a large building were found close to the gate, on the eastern bank of a secondary canal which branched off the main one inside the urban area. Its materials are dated to the late 1st century BCE and the mid-1st century CE. The remains of an imposing complex of porticoed docks was found along the opposite bank of the canal in an electromagnetic survey. The results indicate that it stretched for an over 120 m angled course which seems to faithfully follow the morphology of the canal, whose width was around 10 m. The foundations of another porticoed dock similarly linked to a large building were detected along the canal which marked the southern border of the town, whose bed was indicated by a considerable depression in the terrain in the mid-60s. It stretched eastwards immediately before the northern shoulder of the bridge which linked the Via Annia to the town. It is dated to the late Republic period. It was in a key position in the immediate vicinity of the southern entrance of the town and along a fluvial a route which started from the port and must have gone through the Santa Maria canal. This canal was connected to it. It was also liked to the Via Annia. From here goods could reach the inland markets overland via the Via Annia or by following a wide canal with wooden banks which flanked this road in the north.

As long ago as the 1920s, introduced European deer plagued the Fiordland National Park to the detriment of the native New Zealand flora and fauna. The New Zealand government placed a bounty on the deer, paying local hunters for each animal removed from the park. With the market for venison and deerskin, by the 1960s this had proved a lucrative enough business for several hunters to invest in helicopters, to travel fast through the rugged landscape. Deer populations plummeted as a result, and competition among hunters grew more fierce. Accusations of sabotage and the flouting of rules became common in this unregulated industry. Combined with a growing farm-raised deer industry, and the impact of by-kill due to 1080 poison, the helicopter hunting market declined steeply. However, its legacy lives on, as former hunting helicopters carry tourists and hunters into the New Zealand wilderness. Methods of capture One method of capturing feral deer involved flying beside the fleeing deer and casting a capture net over the deer. Immediately afterwards a crew member would jump from the helicopter and tie and place the deer into \\"livey bags\\" for carrying out to the waiting farmers.  History  European settlers imported red deer for sport into New Zealand and released them into the forests starting in 1851, along with many other introduced animals. The environment proved perfect for a population explosion, the result being widespread damage both to vegetation and to farmers' grazing. The New Zealand government, in order to solve the problem, paid deer cullers a bounty per deer-tail in an attempt to control deer numbers, starting in the 1930s. Until the early 1950s, the sale of deer hides recovered by the government hunters supposedly financed the wildlife culling operations. This ceased when the market collapsed. Then Germany began to purchase exported New Zealand venison, and the deer market hunting industry commenced. Hunters used horses and jet boats to transport deer back to game depots for sale. The typical ‚Äúkiwi bloke‚Äù ‚Äúdo-it-yourself‚Äù identity created and developed this self-made industry. (Compare \\"Southern man\\".) The next stage of development saw the introduction of helicopters, used for carrying deer back to awaiting trucks positioned at remote road ends, for couriering to the venison- processing factories. This was pioneered by Tim Wallis in 1965. The technique of shooting deer from helicopters with doors removed became perfected with thanks to Rex Forrester, a recognised New Zealand hunting and fishing specialist. By 1970, more than sixty helicopters were being used for deer hunting and recovery. A two hundred deer kill count counted as a highly productive day, worth $17,000, though more crews averaged 100 kills. In 1973, vension prices soared further, resulting in increased illegal yet profitable helicopter hunts and reports of shootings, arson, sabotage, and fist fights. The RNZAF sent two Iroquis helicopters to prevent poaching and trespassing in what became known as the \\"Helicopter Wars\\" or \\"Deer Wars\\". =Methods of in air transport= The crew of the ‚Äúflying hunter‚Äù helicopter consisted of 3 men: pilot, shooter and knife hand. A larger helicopter would support this ‚Äúflying hunter‚Äù helicopter: the bigger machine would transport the shot deer, suspended by a hook, under that helicopter; and also supply fuel to the hunter-unit. Hunters had their bases in remote wilderness areas, either in huts, or living on moored vessels in the Fiordland sounds, used as helicopter pads. =Turn to deer farming= With the strong demand for ‚Äúorganic venison‚Äù from a pure environment, and dwindling population of wild deer, some deer hunters saw advantages in starting deer farming. Initially they captured fawns, hand-raised them and domesticated them: the dawn of deer farming occurred in New Zealand in the 1970s. When compared to farming cattle or sheep, deer farming proved a more than viable operation - it had tax advantages too. As the skills of the hunters increased, the deer became more elusive, the wild deer population declined, demand for breeding stock for deer farms grew, and live-deer prices rose to $3,500 per beast. This live deer hunting industry, unique to New Zealand, became a way of life and a specialised culture. Accidents, injuries, helicopter crashes and, over 80 fatalities occurred increasingly common, as the hunters were often untrained and untrained with firearms and tranquilisers, though lucrative returns kept the hunters returning despite the danger. The New Zealand government intervened through legislation, policing and administration; the deer hunters considered this as harassment to their livelihood. There resulted in a difference in what the authorities and the deer hunters considered ‚Äúfair play‚Äù. Changing tax laws, and deer farms breeding their own stock, bought about the end of this era. The deer repopulate the forest.

The conjoined twins usually have four arms; two, three or four legs; and typically one external genitalia and anus.Duplicata incompleta, dicephalus dipus dibrachius , 2008-06-20 It is mostly confused with pygopagus where the twins are joined ventrally at the buttocks facing away from each other, whereas ischiopagus twins are joined dorsally at the sacrum and coccyx. Parapagus is also similar to ischiopagus; however, parapagus twins are joined side-by-side whereas ischiopagus twins typically have spines connected at a 180¬∞ angle, facing away from one another. Classification Ischiopagus Dipus: This is the rarest variety with the twins sharing two legs with no lower extremities on one side. Ischiopagus Tripus: This is the most common variety. These twins share three legs, the third leg is often two fused legs, or is non-functioning. The twins also usually share only one set of external genitalia. Ischiopagus Tetrapus/Quadripus: This variety has the twins at a symmetrical continuous longitudinal axis with their area of union not broken anteriorly. The axes extends in a straight line but in opposite directions. The lower extremities are oriented at right angles to the axes of the thorax and the adjacent limbs near the union of the ischium belong to the opposite twin. Embryology During embryonic development, twins can form from the splitting of a single embryo (monozygotic) which forms identical twins or the twins can arise from separate oocytes in the same menstrual cycle (dizygotic) which forms fraternal twins. Although the latter is more frequent, monozygotic is the reason conjoined twins can develop. In monozygotic twinning for conjoined twins such as ischiopagi, the twins form by the splitting of a bi-laminar embryonic disc after the formation of the inner cell masses. Thus, making the twins occupy the same amnion which can lead to a conjoining of the twins as a result of the twins not separating properly during the twinning process. Separation occurring between the seventh and thirteenth days should result in a monochorionic, monoamniotic identical twins sharing a yolk sac. If separation of the twins occur in the later stages of development prior to the appearance of the primitive streak and axial orientation, then it can be predicted that conjoined twins will develop. The origin of exactly what goes wrong to produce ischiopagus or any conjoined twin is a result by either incomplete fission or double overlapping inducing centers on the same germ disc. Various studies suggest that mechanical disturbances such as shaking of the blastomeres, exposure of the embryo to cold or insufficient oxygen during the early process of cleavage, grafting organizer onto gastrula or half a gastrula together, or constricting the blastula or early gastrula can cause the incomplete separation of monozygotic twins. However, studies have shown that these disturbances must happen at critical times in the pregnancy for the conjoined twins to develop. Complications Conjoined twins are at high risk to being stillborn or dying shortly after birth. In some cases, a healthy twin and a parasitic twin are born. The parasitic twin has no hope for survival and dies and is then surgically separated from its twin. Depending upon how the twins are attached and what is shared among them, complications can arise from surgically separating the live twin from the dead twin. In Ischiopagus cases, the children share a pelvic region along with the gastrointestinal tract and genital region. Ischiopagus twins need reconstructive surgery for the genitals and gastrointestinal tract in order for normal bowel movements and reproductive possibilities in adulthood. For the Ischiopagus twins that both survive from birth, complications and risks also arise. Usually if both twins survive labor, one twin will be healthy and strong, while the other is malnourished and weak. Thus, surgery would have to be planned in advance to understand the best option and how to keep both children alive during surgery as well as afterwards. Treatment Separation is the only treatment for Ischiopagus. The rarity of the condition as well as the challenge it presents in separating the twins has been difficult to understand. In recent years, with advancing medical technology, physicians have been able to successfully separate Ischiopagus twins. However, it depends on the organs shared, how closely joined the twins are, and what risks could rise from separating the twins during surgery. Since Ischiopagus twins usually share a gastrointestinal tract and other organs in the pelvic region, it takes months of planning to decide whether or not separation of the twins outweighs the complications and risks associated with surgery and reconstruction of organs. Surgery to separate conjoined twins has allowed surgeons to be able to study the mechanisms of embryogenesis as well as the physiological consequences of parabiosis. Separating ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins usually leaves the twins with one leg each. Prognosis Depending upon what organs are shared among the twins and if they are surgically separable, usually only one of the twins makes it through the surgery or they both die due to complications either before or during the surgery. Now that successful surgery has been reported and more findings are becoming available due to research and pre- surgery evaluation, better surgery techniques and procedures will be available in the future to help increase the survival rate of ischiopagus twins as well as other conjoined twins. Epidemiology Ischiopagus is a rare anomaly occurring in about 1 in every 100,000 live births and occurring in 1 out of 10 conjoined twin births. Most Ischiopagus cases are common in the areas of India and Africa. Of the varieties of Ischiopagus twins, Ischiopagus Tetrapus is more prevalent, happening in 68.75% of all Ischiopagus cases. Ischiopagus Tripus occurs in 31.25% of cases while Ischiopagus Dipus occurs in only 6.25% of all Ischiopagus cases.

The supporting cast includes Sydney Greenstreet, Adolphe Menjou, Ava Gardner, Keenan Wynn, and Edward Arnold. The movie is based on the novel The Hucksters by Frederic Wakeman, Sr., a skewering of the post-World War II radio advertising industry with Gable's character alternating in pursuit of Kerr and Gardner. Plot Victor Norman (Clark Gable) is a radio advertising executive just returned from serving in World War II and looking for a job in his old field. He literally throws a few loose dollars out the hotel window, telling the hotel valet that being down to his last even $50 \\"will help me seem sincere about not needing a job.\\" On his way to his interview, he stops and spends thirty-five of them on a \\"sincere\\" hand-painted necktie. Victor Norman: back from the war and looking for big money on Madison Avenue His appointment is at the Kimberly Advertising Agency, with Mr. Kimberly himself (Adolphe Menjou). As the two size each other up, they are interrupted by a phone call from Evan Llewellyn Evans (Sydney Greenstreet), the tyrannical, high-volume chief of the Beautee Soap company, the agency's largest account. The call throws the staff into turmoil and derails Vic's interview, so he offers to perform an unpleasant task for Kimberly: recruit Mrs. Kay Dorrance (Deborah Kerr), widow of a WWII U.S. general and of noble British birth, for a Beautee soap campaign featuring Manhattan socialites. A phone call to the Dorrance home misrepresenting himself as being from the \\"Charity League\\" gets him an appointment. At the elegant Sutton Place townhouse he rapidly charms Kay into agreeing, learning in the process she's not so well-heeled as the home and address suggest. But when they later arrive at the photo shoot, the Beautee art director produces a layout featuring \\"a loose and flouncy\\" negligee. Vic overrules the concept and directs a dignified portrait of Kay, in an evening gown, flanked by her children. In the next day's maelstrom, Vic and \\"Kim\\" are summoned to Beautee's offices where they are confronted by Mr. Evans, whose first action is to expectorate heartily onto his conference table. He summarizes his philosophy on advertising: \\"You have just seen me do a disgusting thing. But you will always remember it!\\" He confronts Vic about the change to his Dorrance ad, and Vic tells him that \\"Beautee soap is a clean product‚Äîand your advertisement is not clean.\\" When Vic plays the radio commercial he produced overnight‚Äî\\"Love That Soap\\"‚ÄîEvans likes it and directs Kim to hire Vic. \\"You have your teeth in our problems,\\" he says, removing and brandishing his own dentures. Vic finds himself attracted to Kay. When the two double-date with Mr. and Mrs. Kimberly, a belligerently drunken Kim confesses that he started his agency by informing on his mentor to government authorities and stealing the Beautee soap account. The featured performer at the nightclub the couples attend is an apparent old flame of Vic's, Jean Ogilvie (Ava Gardner), a torch singer he'd run into and chatted up at his first visit to the Kimberly agency just days earlier. She acts very familiar with Vic in front of his date, unsettling Kay. In the wake of an evening spoiled by Kimberly's behavior, Vic persuades Kay to watch the sunset together at the beach, where they grow close. In the morning glow he arranges a purportedly above-board weekend getaway for the couple at a seaside haunt in Connecticut he'd used for pre-war trysting. When Kay arrives and finds that the place has slipped under its new owner and that the pair have been booked into adjoining rooms with a connecting door she leaves, disgusted at the circumstances and profoundly disappointed in Vic. Evans summons Vic and Kim to an abrupt Sunday morning \\"chat-chat\\" and reveals he wants a new radio variety show built around C-list ex-burlesque comedian Buddy Hare (Keenan Wynn). Chastising the ad men for his having to do their work for them, Evans informs them that Hare's agent Dave Lash (Edward Arnold) will be leaving for the coast on that evening's train. Vic promises to ink a deal on board, before word of Evans's interest leaks out and boosts Hare's price. On the way to the station, he stops at Kay's house, but she is remote: \\"You'll make any promise to make your point,\\" and he replies, \\"That's the kind of guy I am.\\" Their parting is unsettling for each. Evan Llewellyn Evans: tyrant head of Beautee Soap, the agency's biggest account On the train, Vic bumps again into Jean Ogilvie, whom he recruits for his plan to sign Hare: with her shilling, he gets Lash to offer Hare at a bargain basement price. They shake on the deal, and when Lash realizes he has been had, he graciously agrees to honor it. Once in Hollywood, Vic and his writers set about creating the radio show for Hare; early on, they ban him from the proceedings because he is so obnoxious and his jokes are both off-key and threadbare. Vic accepts an invitation from Jeanne for dinner at her place, where both ruefully discover Vic is still in love with Kay. He is surprised to find Kay in the shadows outside his bungalow when he returns, there to try to patch things up. She is successful‚ÄîVic starts talking marriage, and seeing himself as a breadwinner for Kay and her children. Trouble intervenes when a legal technicality threatens the contract with Buddy Hare. Though it appears to be based on an honest mistake by Lash, Vic uses cruel innuendo about Lash's childhood and implied blackmail to get the agent to agree to absorb the large loss he will face making good. Vic immediately regrets the tactic, and Lash's wounded demeanor makes him feel even shabbier. Back in New York with a recording of the proposed show in hand, Vic and Kim are summoned to a 2 AM meeting with Evans immediately upon Vic's arrival. The newly-compliant Vic‚Äînow with thoughts of a family to feed‚Äîfinds himself groveling like everyone else in the room, and realizes it is not for him. Even though Evans liked the show, Vic gets up, tells Evans off for his imperious and belittling behavior, and strides out of the room. Outside in Kay's car, Vic announces their marriage will have to wait until he can regain his earning power. She replies that the kind of money he thinks he needs and believes she'd both desire and deserve isn't important‚Äîthat he \\"can sell things with dignity and taste.\\" He reaches in his pocket, fetches out his last pocket money, and hurls it up the street. \\"Now we're starting with exactly nothing,\\" he says, \\"it's neater that way.\\" Cast *Clark Gable as Victor Albee Norman *Deborah Kerr as Kay Dorrance *Sydney Greenstreet as Evan Llewellyn Evans *Adolphe Menjou as Mr. Kimberly *Ava Gardner as Jean Ogilvie *Keenan Wynn as Buddy Hare *Edward Arnold as David Lash *Aubrey Mather as Mr. Glass *Richard Gaines as Cooke *Frank Albertson as Max Herman *Douglas Fowley as Georgie Gaver *Clinton Sundberg as Michael Michaelson *Gloria Holden as Mrs. Kimberly *Connie Gilchrist as Betty *Kathryn Card as Regina Kennedy *Lillian Bronson as Miss Hammer *Vera Marshe as Gloria *Ralph Bunker as Allison *Virginia Dale as Kimberly Receptionist *Jimmy Conlin as Blake Production Frederic Wakeman's novel The Hucksters (1946) spent 35 weeks in the top stratum of The New York Times Fiction bestseller list,John Bear, The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992. pp. 21-27 aided perhaps by its raunchy, racy controversy. Life magazine called the book \\"last year's best-selling travesty\\"\\"Greenstreet Plays the Great Huckster,\\" Life, March 31, 1947, p. 51 and even Clark Gable, who would eventually star in its film adaptation, said \\"It's filthy and it isn't entertainment.\\"Capua, p. 41 Lifes and Gable's literary sensibilities to the contrary, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer paid $200,000 for the motion picture rights before the novel was even published. Screenwriter Luther Davis and the novel's adapters Edward Choderov and George Wells had \\"an extensive laundering job\\" to do to bring the project into compliance with Louis B. Mayer's tastes and the Hays Office's policies.The New York Times Movie Review Summary They had to eliminate the graphic (for 1946) sexual scenes, and they changed the book's Mrs. Dorrance from a married woman into a war widow‚Äîso she and Vic \\"could live happily ever after.\\" More problematic, though, was the portrayal of the talent agent David Lash, a pivotal character in the second half of the film. Lash was based on Jules Stein, the founder of talent agency MCA, and Lash's Hucksters prot√©g√© Freddie Callahan, who bore an undeniable physical resemblance to Lew Wasserman, Stein's prot√©g√© in 1946 who would eventually head MCA himself.Mann, Denise (2008). Hollywood Independents: the Postwar Talent Takeover. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. . p. 108 Even in 1947, there were \\"fears about reprisals from MCA\\"Mann, pp. 110-111 over the portrayals of Stein and Wasserman, and Vic avers on several occasions that \\"Dave Lash is an honest man\\" when the dispute arises over the Buddy Hare contract. The other problem was Lash/Stein's ethnicity: in the novel, Vic tells Lash people will call his honesty into question because he is a Jew;Mann, p. 111 Davis removed all references to Lash's ethnicity and made him a kid who had been in trouble but had \\"gone straight\\" and succeeded. Once the toned-down screenplay was finished and Clark Gable's comfort with it secured, producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr. made his final casting decisions and \\"assembled an exceptional supporting cast\\"Capua, p. 42 featuring Sidney Greenstreet, Adolphe Menjou and Edward Arnold, Keenan Wynn and the then \\"still-unknown Ava Gardner.\\"Capua, p. 43 MGM executives had selected The Hucksters as the debut Hollywood film for Kerr, who had drawn attention for her appearances in ten films in her native England since 1941, causing production to be \\"rushed by Louis B. Mayer, who wanted to release it the following August, trying to revive Gable's name after the flop of Adventure, his last film and launching Deborah's in Hollywood.\\" As the start of production neared, Ava Gardner grew nervous about appearing with Gable, an actor she had idolized since childhood.Server, Lee (2006). Ava Gardner: Love is Nothing. New York: St. Martin's Press. . p. 146 Hornblow asked Gable to call her, and he told her: \\"I'm supposed to talk you into doing this thing. But I'm not going to. I hated it when they did that to me. But I hope you change your mind, kid, I think it would be fun to work together.\\"Server, p. 147 The two remained friends for the rest of Gable's life. Gable also sought to make a nervous Kerr feel relaxed when shooting commenced. He sent her six dozen roses on the first day, and \\"the two hit it off beautifully from the beginning, on and off the set.\\" Director Jack Conway, an MGM regular with credits stretching back to the silent era, brought this, his penultimate film, in on Mayer's August 1947 timetable. His budget was $2.3 million. Release MGM used a \\"splash\\" approach on The Hucksters, opening in 350 theaters on July 17, 1947 before expanding to 1,000 theaters a week later, one of the widest releases of the time. Reception =Critical reception= Although Louis B. Mayer had chosen carefully‚Äîand spent lavishly‚Äîon a property to launch Deborah Kerr and attempt to recoup Clark Gable's popularity after the poorly received Adventure, The Hucksters was not well received by contemporary critics. Life magazine had excoriated the Wakeman novel, its film reviewer commented: \\"The movie version of the famous attack on the advertising business fails to live up to its own ads\\" and called it \\"[a] cynically exaggerated study of big business and big advertising.\\"Life magazine, July 28, 1947, p. 103 Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, wrote that it was simply too much Gable. \\"[U]nless you like Clark Gable very much, you are going to find him monotonous in this hour-and-fifty-five-minute film... [he] is off the screen for all of five minutes‚Äîmaybe eight. The rest of the time, he's on.\\" He liked Deborah Kerr rather more: \\"We could do with a little more of her. Not that her rather radiant passion for this well-tailored roughneck makes much sense, but Miss Kerr is a very soothing person and she elevates the tone of the film.\\" He saved his biggest praise for Greenstreet and Menjou, calling their contributions \\"entertaining and fascinating.\\" Brog. of Variety was lukewarm: \\"Somehow Clark Gable just doesn't quite take hold of the huckster part in signal manner. Same goes for Deborah Kerr who is a shade prissy for her volatile romantic role.\\" Like the Times, they were more enthusiastic about the supporting cast: \\"Sydney Greenstreet's portrayal of the soap despot emerges as the performance of the picture, as does Keenan Wynn as the ham ex-burlesque candy butcher gone radio comic. Ava Gardner is thoroughly believable as the on-the-make songstress; Adolphe Menjou is the harassed head of the radio agency which caters to Evans' whilom ways because it's a $10 million account.\\" Finally, there was an observation, politely put, that no doubt crossed the minds of many 1947 moviegoers: \\"Gable looks trim and fit but somehow a shade too mature for the capricious role of the huckster who talks his way into a $35,000 job [and] is a killer with the femmes....\\" Gable's interaction with the two women in the story generated commentary. When it came to the romance between Vic and Kay, Life magazine stuck to its negative guns: \\"The love story is stupefyingly dull. Opposite the ladylike Deborah, Clark Gable's mannered virility seems embarrassing‚Äîsomething that never happened to him alongside such tough Tessies as Joan Crawford and Jean Harlow in his greater days.\\"Life, July 28, 1947, p. 103 But others applauded Kerr and the pairing: The Hollywood Reporter called Kerr \\"a charming English star... a delightful personality in her American debut.\\" The New York Herald-Tribune called the Gable-Kerr pairing \\"ideal\\", saying \\"she made an impressive bow on the U.S. screen.\\" Ava Gardner biographer Lee Server, pointing to the chemistry between Vic and his old flame Jean Ogilvie (Gable and Gardner): \\"proved to be a wonderful pairing, with an on-screen spark between them that revealed their genuine amusement and easy pleasure in each other's company.\\"Server, p. 147 Judgment about The Hucksters has mellowed over the years. Halliwell's Film Guide calls it \\"good topical entertainment which still entertains and gives a good impression of its period\\", also praising the performance of Greenstreet. The current New York Times capsule summary calls it \\"one of Clark Gable's best postwar films, as well as one of the finest Hollywood satires of the rarefied world of advertising.\\" =Box office= The Hucksters opened at number one at the US box office, with a non-holiday record in New York City. It finished twelfth at the box office for 1947, earning $3,635,000 in the US and Canada and $810,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $412,000.Variety says the earnings were $4.7 million in rentals see \\"Top Grossers of 1947\\", Variety, 7 January 1948 p 63Mann, p. 272 Topping that list was another soldiers-come-home tale, The Best Years of Our Lives. Author Denise Mann suggests that Vic Norman's unsavory side might have held The Hucksters back: \\"Clark Gable's unheroic ad-man as post-war returning hero may have contributed to the smaller returns.\\" It also \\"was a total failure in the foreign market, which in those days knew nothing about American advertising or commercial broadcasting.\\" Home video The Hucksters was released on VHS. Its first DVD release was finally announced in August 2011 as part of the Warner Archive Collection.

This includes both those from India and overseas Indians. In modern colloquial usage it is commonly not capitalised. The term is used in the Malay Archipelago ‚Äî specifically Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei ‚Äî but cognates exist in neighbouring countries as well. Although the early definition was neutral and linked to the historical Kalinga kingdom of Eastern India, its use in later history came to be perceived as a derogatory term to refer to people of Indian descent, especially in Malaysia. Etymology The word Keling derives from the ancient Indian kingdom of Kalinga. While this was apparently sometimes localized as Kalingga (as in the Indonesian Kalingga Kingdom), the terminal schwa sound was dropped in common usage to form Keling. Though ostensibly denoting the Kalinga kingdom, the term Keling in ancient Southeast Asia came to be a more general term for India and its people. The Khmer word Kleng (·ûÄ·üí·ûõ·û∑·ûÑ·üí·ûÇ) and the Thai word Khaek (‡πÅ‡∏Ç‡∏Å) derived from the same root. Prior to the introduction of the English word \\"India\\", Keling and Jambu Dwipa were used to refer to the country in the Malay and Indonesian language, while Benua Keling referred to the Indian Subcontinent.  Usage  The earliest known occurrence of the word Keling appears in the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals). The legend mentions Raja Shulan as the king of Kalingga who sets out to conquer China with his descendant Raja Chulan. Scholars identify Raja Chulan with the Chola king of southern India, from whom the term Chulia derives, as in Penang's Chulia Street. Later parts of the Sejarah Melayu mention the voyages of Hang Nadim and Hang Tuah to Benua Keling (India). However Keling must not be misunderstood as a specific territory, rather it refers to people of Indian origin and not only the inhabitants of Kalinga. For example, a colonial-era Indonesian tradition refers to the Ramayana epic as Rama Keling meaning \\"Rama the Indian\\". After the introduction of Islam, Keling sometimes referred specifically to Tamils or Telugu people while Gujaratis and Indo-Aryan peoples from Pakistan were often confused with Parsi or Persians. The Dutch used the words \\"Clings\\" and \\"Klingers\\" to refer to the Indian inhabitants of Malacca. The British colonial writings also use the word \\"Kling\\" to describe the immigrants from Madras Presidency and Coromandel coast. John Crawfurd (1856) mentioned that the term \\"Kling\\" was used by the Malays and the Javanese as \\"a general term for all the people of Hindustan (North India), and for the country India itself\\". The 16th-century Portuguese traveller Castanheda wrote of the Keling community in Melaka in the period between 1528-1538: > In the northern part [of the city of Malacca] live merchants known as > Quelins [Klings ‚Äî a name applied to South Indians]; in this part the town is > much larger than at any other. There are at Malacca, many foreign merchants > ... In its early usage Keling was a neutral term for people of Indian origin, but was perceived negatively beginning in the 20th century due to various socio- political factors. From the mid-1900s, words denoting ethnic origin were used derogatively in Malay to imply immigrant status. Consequently, more neutral language was chosen for political correctness. This can be observed in the book Cherita Jenaka, where the term orang Keling (Keling people) in the 1960 edition was changed to orang India (Indian people) in the 1963 edition. =Malay= The word Keling has been used variously within the Malay community to mean Indian, Tamil, or south Indian. The title \\"Kapitan Keling\\" was used for a representative of an Indian community, similar to the \\"Kapitan Cina\\" of a Chinese community. In early Penang of the 1790s the Kapitan Keling was Cauder Mohideen who, together with the Kapitan Cina Koh Lay Huan and other prominent members of the community, formed the first Committee of Assessors to decide the rates and collection of taxes. This usage is preserved is the name of the Kapitan Keling Mosque, a prominent Penang landmark. In many modern cases Keling is used as a derogatory term. It was used in 2005 by Members of Parliament in Malaysia because of misconception about Indian ethnics, which resulted in an uproar accusing the MPs of racism. =Javanese= Traditionally in Java, Indonesia, Keling is linked with India while Kalingga refers to the 6th century Kalingga Kingdom, which ultimately derived from the Indian Kalinga kingdom. It can possibly have other meanings, such as \\"ship\\". Rivets used to connect metals are called paku keling (lit. \\"blunt nail\\"); however, it came from Dutch klinknagel. In modern colloquial Indonesian, it is sometimes used to refer to any dark-skinned person, a stereotype of southern Indians, though this usage is considered offensive. =Cambodian= In Cambodia, the slang term for Indian people is Kleng (·ûÄ·üí·ûõ·û∑·ûÑ·üí·ûÇ),Headley, RK et al, \\"SEALang Library Khmer\\", SEALang Library, 1977 also derived from the kingdom of Kalinga and cognate with the Malay Keling or Kling. It may also be used as a nickname for people who have stereotypically Indian features such as big eyes and dark skin.Vorng Vanny, Heartbreaking: A Survival Memoir, New York, Page Publishing, Inc, 2018 =Thai= The equivalent of Keling in the Thai language is Khaek (‡πÅ‡∏Ç‡∏Å). It is a generic term referring to anyone from South Asia. The term generally has no negative connotation and is used even in polite or formal communication. However, outside influence and confusion with Mughals and Indian Muslims has broadened the meaning in modern times to include certain predominantly Muslims communities, particularly Persians and Arabs. This extended meaning is considered inaccurate and at times rejected as derogatory, especially by Thai Muslims, but has become increasingly widespread. =Chinese= The phrases Keling-a (Hokkien; ÂêâÂØß‰ªî; POJ: Ki-l√™ng-√°), Keling-yan (Cantonese; ÂêâÂØß‰∫∫; Yale: gat-l√¨hng-yan), and Keling-kia (Teochew) are frequently used within the Chinese community in Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore. Currently, another non-offensive word to call the Indians is Yin-toh-lang The Hokkien and Teochew suffixes -a and -kia are diminutives that are generally used to refer to non-Chinese ethnic groups, while \\"-yan\\" mean human. Names of places Various place names in Malaysia contain the word Keling for historical reasons, e.g. Tanjong Keling., Kampong Keling, and Bukit Keling, etc. In Penang, the Kapitan Keling Mosque, situated on the corner of Buckingham Street and Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling (Pitt Street), is one of the oldest mosques in George Town. Various other Penang Hokkien street names contain the word Keling, e.g. Kiet-leng-a Ban-san (Chowrasta Road), Kiet- leng-a Ke (King Street/Market Street). In Singapore, there is a road in Jurong Industrial Estate called Tanjong Kling Road which is probably derived from the word 'Keling'. In Jepara Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, there is a district called Keling. Locals link the location with the 6th century Kalingga Kingdom. In Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, there is a place called Pacar Keling meaning \\"Keling lover\\".

The 16th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on May 27, 1998. It marks the first appearance of Stephen Stotch, who is later Butters Stotch‚Äôs father in later seasons. The episode was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with David R. Goodman, and directed by Parker. In the episode, Officer Barbrady resigns as South Park's only police officer because of his illiteracy. Anarchy ensues, just as chickens are mysteriously being molested across South Park. Barbrady enlists the help of the boys to learn to read and discover who is molesting the chickens. Cartman, meanwhile, masquerades as a police officer. Plot Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman visit the Booktastic Bus, a mobile library. They are initially intrigued, but become uninterested in reading after meeting the strange driver. Word spreads that a pervert is molesting chickens in town. When Officer Barbrady starts the investigation, he is confronted with his illiteracy. He resigns in shame and anarchy immediately breaks out. Later, he is put into the boys' class to learn to read. Barbrady recruits the boys to help him with his task, showing his knowledge of the police code. From then on, Cartman patrols the town on his Big Wheel, enforcing his own brand of justice. The molester is finally caught in the petting zoo and turns out to be the bookmobile driver. He plotted this all along to encourage Barbrady to learn to read. After being given a copy of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, Barbrady knocks down the man with a club to the head to teach Cartman how to properly deal with criminals. The town holds a parade for Barbrady, and when he is asked to give a speech, he reveals how Atlas Shrugged convinced him to never read again. Production Originally, Cartman was supposed to receive a gun during his stint as a deputy police officer, but Comedy Central's censors were reluctant to show a child with a firearm. The season one episode \\"Volcano\\" depicted children wielding firearms, but it was allowed then as the usage was considered less controversial by Comedy Central.

A Shock Response Spectrum (SRS)Acronym- Acronym is a graphical representation of a shock, or any other transient acceleration input, in terms of how a Single Degree Of Freedom (SDOF) system (like a mass on a spring) would respond to that input. The horizontal axis shows the natural frequency of a hypothetical SDOF, and the vertical axis shows the peak acceleration which this SDOF would undergo as a consequence of the shock input.Explanation-Explanation Calculation The most direct and intuitive way to generate an SRS from a shock waveform is the following procedure: # Pick a damping ratio (or equivalently, a quality factor Q) for your SRS to be based on; # Pick a frequency f, and assume that there is a hypothetical Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system with a damped natural frequency of f; # Calculate (by direct time-domain simulation) the maximum instantaneous absolute acceleration experienced by the mass element of your SDOF at any time during (or after) exposure to the shock in question. This acceleration is a; # Draw a dot at (f,a); # Repeat steps 2‚Äì4 for many other values of f, and connect all the dots together into a smooth curve. The resulting plot of peak acceleration vs test system frequency is called a Shock Response Spectrum. It is often plotted with frequency in Hz, and with acceleration in units of g Example application Consider a computer chassis containing three cards with fundamental natural frequencies of f1, f2, and f3. Lab tests have previously confirmed that this system survives a certain shock waveform‚Äîsay, the shock from dropping the chassis from 2 feet above a hard floor. Now, the customer wants to know whether the system will survive a different shock waveform‚Äîsay, from dropping the chassis from 4 feet above a carpeted floor. If the SRS of the new shock is lower than the SRS of the old shock at each of the three frequencies f1, f2, and f3, then the chassis is likely to survive the new shock. (It is not, however, guaranteed.) Details and limitations Any transient waveform can be presented as an SRS, but the relationship is not unique; many different transient waveforms can produce the same SRS (something one can take advantage of through a process called \\"Shock Synthesis\\"). Due to only tracking the peak instantaneous acceleration the SRS does not contain all the information in the transient waveform from which it was created.Research-Research Different damping ratios produce different SRSs for the same shock waveform. Zero damping will produce a maximum response. Very high damping produces a very boring SRS: A horizontal line. The level of damping is demonstrated by the \\"quality factor\\", Q which can also be thought of transmissibility in sinusoidal vibration case. Relative damping of 5% results in a Q of 10. An SRS plot is incomplete if it doesn't specify the assumed Q value. An SRS is of little use for fatigue-type damage scenarios, as the transform removes information of how many times a peak acceleration (and inferred stress) is reached. The SDOF system model also can be used to characterize the severity of vibrations, with two criteria: * the exceeding of characteristic instantaneous stress limits (yield stress, ultimate stress etc.). We then define the extreme response spectrum (ERS), similar to the shock response spectrum; * the damage by fatigue following the application of a large number of cycles, thus taking into account the duration of the vibration (Fatigue damage spectrum (FDS)). Like many other useful tools, the SRS is not applicable to significantly non-linear systems.

In 1936 he transferred to foreign intelligence and was sent to England as cipher clerk and assistant to the London rezident. During the Great Purges of 1939 the London rezidentura was liquidated, and in March 1940 Gorsky was recalled to Moscow. Gorsky survived the purges and was appointed London rezident in November 1940, during the Hitler-Stalin pact. In London his first cover was attach√©, then second secretary of the Soviet embassy. As London rezident Gorsky took over managing eighteen agents, including the Cambridge Five, and the initial Soviet penetration of the British atomic bomb project. The London rezidentura consisted of only three people. By the end of the war there were twelve operational workers. In the heaviest period of war, from 1941 to 1942 the London rezidentura was the basic information source of Soviet operations on Germany and countries of the anti-Hitler coalition. More than 10 thousand documentary materials along political, economic, military and other questions were sent from the London rezidentura to Moscow. In September 1941 the London rezidentura obtained and sent to Moscow documentary materials on work in Great Britain and the USA on the creation of nuclear weapons and supplied a constant stream of information. During January 1944 Gorsky returned to Moscow after the completion of this mission and was assigned deputy division head.

Those two songs are now Zombie Apocalypse songs.

Their lyrics have a political undercurrent that uses horrific imagery as a metaphor to touch on various political, personal, and social issues. They have released two albums: This Is a Spark of Life, on Indecision Records and featuring artwork by Dan Henk, and a split with Leeds, UK-based, and fellow zombie enthusiasts, Send More Paramedics, called Tales Told by Dead Men, released in North America on Hell Bent Records and in Europe on In at the Deep End Records. They also contributed a cover of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to a Guns N' Roses tribute album released by Reignition Records.

It was made in association with New World Television for the Nine Network, and aired between 1993 and 1994. The series was created by Wayne Doyle and is set around characters living and working on Queensland's Gold Coast and was filmed largely on location, offering views of crashing waves, golden beaches and scantily clad young women and men. Paradise Beach was intended not only as a rival to Australian soaps Neighbours and Home and Away, but also to be the first breakthrough Australian soap to make it in America. History =Production= Veteran Australian producer Jock Blair was the driving force behind Paradise Beach, with Nick McMahon as Executive Producer, and the first episodes of the soap were aimed at the American audience. Australian actress Tiffany Lamb used an American accent in her role as Lisa Whitman, and her opening storyline revolved around her childhood sweetheart Cooper Hart (played by Olivia Newton-John's then-husband Matt Lattanzi). Also appearing from the start were Robert Coleby (Chopper Squad, The Young Doctors) as Tom Barsby, and another familiar face was Andrew McKaige (Sons and Daughters, Prisoner) as Tom's younger brother Nick. The rest of the original cast consisted of unknown actors all in their first acting roles. These included Ingo Rademacher, now famous for his separate roles in American series Titans and General Hospital. Here, he played Sean Hayden. His on-screen sister Tori, was played by Megan Connolly. The actress died on 6 September 2001 of a drug overdose, following short stints in Breakers and Home and Away. Finally, Raelee Hill was cast as scheming Loretta Taylor, Jaason Simmons was cast as bronzed lifeguard Harry Tait, Manu Bennett (credited as Jon Bennett) was cast as Kirk Barsby, son of Tom and his sister Cassie was played by Kimberley Joseph. =Retooling= When Paradise Beach was taken off the air in America, all traces of Americanism were removed and the producers concentrated on making the series work in its homeland and Europe. Matt Lattanzi departed, but not before Olivia Newton-John made a brief cameo, beaming down from the entrance of an aeroplane. Further additions to the cast included more experienced actors from other soaps including Melissa Bell from Neighbours as Emily Harris, and former-E Street regular Melissa Tkautz arrived as Vanessa Campbell. However, after two seasons, Nine Network eventually cancelled Paradise Beach after just 260 episodes. After the series ended, Jaason Simmons joined the cast of Baywatch the following year. Kimberley Joseph featured in a recurring role in the cult-TV hit Lost as air hostess Cindy Chandler. =Reception= The series was largely savaged by the critics. With negative comparisons to the American shows Baywatch and Beverly Hills, 90210, the soap failed to make an impression in America. It was a similar disastrous launch in Australia, where it aired at 5.30pm, and even in the UK where Australian soaps of any quality are generally very popular, it flopped in an early evening 6.30pm timeslot, this may have been down to the fact it was broadcast on Sky Television, unlike most of the other popular shows which were seen on BBC or ITV. The show has never been released on VHS or DVD. International broadcasts * In the UK, the soap was launched in a blaze of publicity on Sky Television in late October 1993 in the 6.30pm time slot with a 12.30pm repeat the following afternoon. Sky moved the more popular, but recently axed Australian soap opera, E Street to a weekend slot, but when Paradise Beach flopped in Britain as well as Australia, Sky moved E Street back to weekdays and Paradise Beach was screened at 6pm and mid day, creating an 'Aussie Soap Hour' for a few months until August 1994. Grampian Television broadcast the full series, every Monday to Wednesday at 17.10 slot from January 1996 and until July 1997. * Paradise Beach was screened in Venezuela by RCTV (Radio Caracas Television) on their matinal block of soap operas with a low rating. The series, named in Spanish \\"Playa Para√≠so\\". * The series was broadcast in Italy on Rai Due in 1994/1995 at around 8.30 in the morning and 2:30 pm. * The series started on 27 September 1993 * The series was also broadcast in France during 1993/1994. * The series started on 5 January 1998 * The show aired weekdays on TVNZ's Channel 2 in 1993. It was later rerun on Prime Television in 2002. * The series started around 1993 * The series aired on the Israeli channel 2 during 1995 * The show aired in daily syndication during the Spring and Summer of 1993, as somewhat of a replacement for the similar style show Swans Crossing. The show aired on most stations in the after school/late afternoon hours. * It was also screened in Chile by Canal 13 (Chile). * It was also screened in Colombia in 1994 by RCN. * It was also screened in Mexico by TV Azteca. * The series aired on Pro TV during 1996 Parody Paradise Beach was parodied extensively in the popular Australian comedy series The Late Show. Emphasized was the poor acting, the formulaic plot and characterization, characters dancing every time rock-and-roll music was played, and the cash-in mentality of filming the soap series at a beachside studio complex. Several times throughout the sketch the characters would, in unison, point offstage and exclaim \\"Hey! Warner Brothers Movie World!\\".

Sunshine, Special K and Spoonie Gee (who left in the late 1970s), with occasional contributions from DJ Dano B, DJ Reggie Reg and DJ Crazy Eddie. They first appeared on record in 1980 on the B side of Spoonie Gee's single Love Rap.  History  = Origin = Kool Moe Dee and L.A Sunshine (Lamar Hill) grew up in the same neighborhood and they met DJ Easy Lee (Theodore Moy'e) in elementary school. Kool Moe Dee and Easy Lee both went to Norman Thomas high school where they met Special K (Kevin Keaton). DJ Easy Lee met Spoonie G through playing basketball and through his sister who knew Spoonie G. When Spoonie G left the group, Kool Moe Dee replaced him with Special K. Although he technically had left the group Spoonie G was still affiliated. Spoonie G released a single called Spoonin Rap with the record label Sound of New York. After his relationship broke down with the label he got a deal with Enjoy which was owned by his uncle, Bobby Robinson. He managed to persuade his uncle to let the Treacherous Three do a song on the B side of his first single with Enjoy which was called Love Rap and the B side was the song New Rap Language, which was released in 1980. New Rap Language was popular and made the group famous for the fast rapping style they used (dubbed speed rapping), which would be what they were originally known for. After this Enjoy gave the group a single deal. = First releases = Also in 1980, they released Body Rock, which was one of the first records to mix hip-hop and rock and roll. They also released At the Party, Put the Boogie In Your Body and Feel the Heartbeat (1981), the latter of which was very popular at the time. The group approached Bobby Robinson to express their unhappiness with the money they were making at the time; the group received $3,000 each for each record they made. = Sugarhill Records = In 1981, they moved to Sugar Hill Records. Their first single at Sugarhill was Whip It which featured singer Philipp√© Wynne, formerly of the Spinners, which was very popular at the time. That single sampled The Dazz Band 1982 hit \\"Let It Whip\\". They then released the song Yes We Can-Can which followed on from the political trend that was set by the Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's single \\"The Message.\\" In 1983, they released Action, Turning you On and Get Up. In 1984 they released, Xmas Rap and Santa's Rap. By 1985 the group was being overshadowed by other groups such as Run-D.M.C. and L.A Sunshine was getting increasingly frustrated with their financial situation at Sugarhill and eventually became disillusioned with making records. During this time many of the groups signed to Sugarhill Records were put on suspension and Special K and L.A Sunshine didn't want to make any more records for Sylvia Robinson (the co-owner of Sugarhill). Kool Moe Dee was the only MC in the group that was still actively working for Sugarhill, writing for the Sugarhill Gang. In 1985 Kool Moe Dee managed to persuade Special K and L.A Sunshine to go back into the studio to record Gotta Rock. when it came to recording the B side to Gotta Rock, Turn it Up L.A Sunshine did not turn up to the recording session and Special K did not stay for the full session. Kool Moe Dee felt that Special K's rhymes were not up to his usual standards and therefore left them out. This would lead to the rise to Kool Moe Dee's solo career and the breakup of the group.  Film career  The Group also had a short lived film career. Kool Moe Dee and L.A Sunshine had a brief cameo appearance in the movie Wildstyle, at the end of the film they are seen performing. Kool Moe Dee can also be seen briefly during the film as well. In 1984 they appeared in the film Beat Street, where they performed their song \\"Santa's Rap\\" along with a young Doug E. Fresh. Kool Moe Dee later went on to appear in numerous films and television programmes after the group split up. Kool Moe Dee released rap single \\"Wild Wild West\\" in 1988.  Reunion  In 1993, the group resurfaced to do a reunion album on Easy Lee's record label Wrap Records. The album, Old School Flava was released in 1994. The first single released was \\"Feel the New Heartbeat\\" which was a remix of the original record \\"Feel the Heartbeat\\", the new version included Doug E. Fresh. DJ Easy Lee expressed the view that one of the reasons that the album was not as well received as they thought it would be was because the new version of \\"Feel the Heartbeat\\" was almost exactly the same and that they should have released the posse cut \\"We Wit It\\" which featured Big Daddy Kane, Chuck D, Grandmaster Caz, Heavy D, Melle Mel, and Tito (of The Fearless Four); this song was a lot more popular but was never released as a single. In 1999 the group released Turn It Up which featured previously released records and was their unofficial greatest hits album. Since then the group has not released any new material.  Legacy  The Treacherous Three are remembered as the originators of fast rapping, directly influencing MCs such as T La Rock, LL Cool J and Rakim. They are also known as the first MC's to represent lyrical rap. They were also the first MCs to perform in Brazil, Holland, and Bermuda and were among the first MC's to travel to approximately 14 other countries. Kool Moe Dee began a successful solo career in 1986 and is known for such classic hits as \\"Wild Wild West\\", \\"Go See the Doctor\\", \\"God Made Me Funke\\", \\"I Go To Work\\" and \\"How Ya Like Me Now\\". Moe Dee also became legendary within hip-hop for his long- standing rivalry with LL Cool J. Special K put out his own solo single in 1987. L.A. went on to choreograph all of Kool Moe Dee's videos just as he did with all of the Treacherous Three's shows. DJ Easy Lee moved on to producing music and took a job as National Director of Promotions at Ichiban Records.

The town is located on the Costa del Azahar, north of the Serra d'Irta along the Mediterranean coast. It is a popular tourist destination. History Peniscola, often called the \\"Gibraltar of Valencia\\", and locally as \\"The City in the Sea\\",http://www.peniscola.spain-and-spanish.co.uk/ is a fortified seaport, with a lighthouse, built on a rocky headland about 220 feet (67 m) high, and joined to the mainland by only a narrow strip of land (Pen√≠scola is a local evolution of Latin peninsula). The history of the place goes back to the Iberians. Later the town became Phoenician, named Tyreche, then Greek, under the name Chersonesos (meaning \\"peninsula\\"). It was next captured by the Carthaginians under Hamilcar Barca; legend has it that this is the place where he made his son Hannibal swear an oath that he would never be a friend of Rome. The present castle was built by the Knights Templar between 1294 and 1307. In the fourteenth century it was garrisoned by the Knights of Montesa, and in 1420 it reverted to the Crown of Aragon. From 1415 to 1423 it was the home of the schismatic Avignon pope Benedict XIII (Pedro de Luna), whose name is commemorated in the Castell del Papa Luna, the name of the medieval castle, and Bufador del Papa Luna, a curious cavern with a landward entrance through which the seawater escapes in clouds of spray. The castle The castle where Benedict lived from 1417 until his death in 1423 was restored, improved and new walls were added in 1960 when Anthony Mann's film El Cid was partially filmed there. The town and castle of Pen√≠scola played the role of Valencia. The castle is now a popular tourist attraction and the beaches and surrounding area are a popular family holiday resort. Film festival Peniscola hosted an annual comedy film festival that draws Spanish and foreign actors and filmmakers, and features screenings in historic venues. That the festival celebrates comedy is a natural fit; the city was the backdrop for Luis Garc√≠a Berlanga's comedic masterpiece Calabuch.

They are New Zealand's premier tracks, through areas of some of the best scenery in the country, ranging from coastlines with beaches to dense rain forests and alpine terrain. The tracks are maintained to a high standard, making it easier for visitors to explore some of the most scenic parts of New Zealand's backcountry. The walks range from length to in length and take between 3 and 6 days to complete, with the Whanganui Journey on river being long over 5 days. Only the Tongariro Northern Circuit and the Kepler Track are loop walks, all other Great Walks require transport to return to the starting point. History The Great Walks network was established by the Department of Conservation in 1993. The network was established both as a way to advertise hiking in New Zealand, but also as a means of managing and conserving the most popular tracks which were increasingly being damaged by unrestricted tourism. Seven of the walks are covered by Google Street View from November 2015. Facilities The backcountry huts are conveniently located, comfortable, well-equipped, and high capacity. Both the huts and tracks on the Great Walks are of a higher standard than other tramping tracks in the country. These tracks are very popular with overseas visitors, partly due to their heavy promotion by the Department of Conservation and tourism operators. All of the Great Walks have booking systems to manage visitor pressure. Guided walks are available through private operators along many of the walks. There is no charge required for walking access to the Great Walks, however, charges apply for overnight accommodation at the huts or campsites. To conserve the tracks, it is illegal to camp within of a Great Walk track or of the Milford Track except at designated campsites. It is not possible to access the Milford Track without having booked the track accommodation, as both ends of the track require boat transport to get there. Sections of the Abel Tasman Coastal Track are particularly popular for day walks without overnight accommodation, as even the middle sections are serviced by water taxis.

It was also repeated (and edited to tone down its racier overtones) for a daytime slot on Nine while they lobbied (unsuccessfully) to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a daytime drama to count towards their local drama quota points. Despite getting 1.7 million viewers for its first episode at 9.30pm, within a few weeks the show was getting just 135,000 viewers in its regular 11pm timeslot. Most critics described it as rubbish but some changed their minds during the show's second season. 'The Sydney Morning Herald said it was \\"immeasurably improved in looks, acing and writing\\" while The Sunday Telegraph named it one of the 10 Best Shows on TV for 1997. The \\"final\\" episode was screened on 6 April 2000 before Nine realised a mistake had been made (when the first three episodes had been edited down into a punchier one hour premiere) so they eventually screened the last ever episode a year later as a one-off send-off. Had it aired without interruption, it would have taken just 18 months to complete its run instead of five years. Series synopsis The series was conceived as a flamboyant, melodramatic soap opera and dealt with the lives of wealthy Australians living on the Gold Coast. Although criticised for being an Australian copy of the American soap opera Melrose Place, its outrageous storylines ‚Äì including corporate scheming, various affairs, serial killers and a lesbian love triangle (the first on an Australian TV soap) ‚Äì saw the series gain a cult reputation. International screenings In the UK, the show was purchased by the then new TV station, Sky 2 and paired with Melrose Place. The show did not rate very well and when the TV station itself began to flounder, they moved all their high profile shows back to Sky 1, the show was put onto double showings Friday and Saturdays and ended its run just before the station closed. In the US, it aired on KDOC in Los Angeles, CA. In New Zealand, it aired on Prime Television. Storylines The soap opera opened with the murder of Sonia Kingsley and introduced all the characters via her murder investigation (the 4WD killer turned out to be her secret lover Adam). Daughter Amber Kingsley came to town and married her stepfather Trey in a bid to get her mother's fortune which was based around a radio station. But her bitchy ways pushed Trey over the edge and he snapped and became a serial killer, eventually murdering Callie, Sondra, Nick, Cameron and his sister-in- law Georgina. He was arrested while holding Amber hostage but was found innocent after faking multiple personalities and escaped the Drive with Bethany, only to electrocute himself while trying to drown her. Pacific Drive was the first Australian drama to get its own website and the feedback from fans revealed that they loved some characters and loved to hate some others. One who didn't get a mention either way was Laura so writer Bevan Lee did a lookalike story but avoided the twin cliche. When doppelg√§nger Anna came to town coveting Laura's life (and her fianc√© Luke who had been revealed to be Sonia's secret son and therefore another Kingsley heir), Simone Buchanan took turns playing both roles while her former Hey Dad..! co-star Sarah Monahan played her double in two-shots. Luke went in search of his real father, Bill Garland, but he killed himself when it was revealed he had been molesting his daughter Liza who died of an ecstasy overdose in Joel's nightclub. When Rowena Wallace accidentally overdosed, scripts were hastily re-written for Mara's gay theatrical friend Marcus to continue her scheming. After she returned to the show but in need of more medical care, Mara was hit by a car and woke up with amnesia, now being played by Olivia Hamnett Amongst all the bed-hopping, Zoe was the most active but only after she came out as a lesbian. Her girlfriends included Margaux, Dior, Sondra, Kay and Gemma before she fell pregnant and married Tim to keep him in the country (with TV Soap remarking that a lesbian and a prostitute marrying must be Australian TV's most bizarre wedding ever). The show's other great legacy amongst its many gay fans was Bethany learning she was HIV positive but when Nine changed the show's direction (preferring to screen it in daytime rather than late night), Bethany remarked how her combination therapies were working and Zoe settled down to wedded bliss with Tim, thereby bringing all edgy stories to an end. The show ended with Bethany calling off her marriage to Grant when his newly recovered mother Mara began to interfere again. Anna, caught faking a pregnancy to Luke, told Dr Josh she was in love with him and promised she would try to curb her crazy tendencies. Tim died when fell foul of a drug sting gone wrong and Zoe told Martin she would never forgive him for organising the police operation. Amber quit her corporate lifestyle and drove in search of Brett, the former gigolo who had been married to her aunt whom she now realised was the love of her life.

His tenure is best known for his controversial 1996 decision to allow the cultivation of GMO soy in Argentina, authorized a mere 81 days after Monsanto applied for a permit. Governor of Buenos Aires On 10 December 1999, he became Vice Governor of Buenos Aires under Carlos Ruckauf, and took up the governorship on 3 January 2002, when Ruckauf resigned to become Foreign Affairs Minister for interim President Eduardo Duhalde after the socioeconomic collapse of 2001. Sol√° abandoned his political allegiance to Duhalde after President N√©stor Kirchner did likewise, aligning with Kirchner's expansionist policies. As governor and amid 9% economic growth, his support for Kirchnerist candidates in his province during the campaign for the 2005 legislative elections helped result for a landslide win over Duhalde's faction and other parties. He successfully headed Kirchner's Front for Victory party list for his province's congressional candidates in 2007, stepped down as governor and returned to Congress. Legislative terms Having been rejected as running mate for 2007 Front for Victory presidential nominee Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, Sol√° became estranged from Kirchnerism during the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector and left their caucus to become a dissident Peronist. Ahead of the 2009 mid-term elections, he joined Francisco de Narv√°ez and Mauricio Macri in Uni√≥n PRO, a center-right coalition of fellow dissident Peronists and the Republican Proposal (PRO) party. Sol√° became a primary candidate in August 2009 for president ahead of the 2011 elections; but lacking support, he withdrew on 11 June and endorsed Duhalde's Popular Union ticket, which went on to fifth place. He later joined the Renewal Front, a centrist Peronist faction created by Sergio Massa ahead of the 2013 mid-term elections. Like Sol√°, Massa had broken with President Cristina Kirchner after the 2008 agro-export tax hike dispute, and the Renewal Front bested Kirchner's Front for Victory in Buenos Aires Province in 2013. Sol√° ran for Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 2015 on the Renewal Front-led United for a New Alternative ticket; but placed third (21%). He then headed Massa's Buenos Aires Province party list for the 2017 mid-term elections, dubbed 1Pa√≠s, but again placed third (11%). He broke with the Renewal Front and on 22 October 2018, joined four fellow Renewal Front congressmen and four allies to create Red por Argentina (RxA; \\"Network for Argentina\\"). Amid a worsening economic crisis Sol√° stated that his goal was to promote unity against the Mauricio Macri administration for the 2019 elections. The member parties of Red por Argentina would later join the broader Frente de Todos coalition. Appointment as foreign minister On 6 December 2019, it was announced Sol√° would be the next Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship of Argentina in the incoming cabinet of President Alberto Fern√°ndez.. He assumed office alongside the rest of the cabinet on 10 December 2019.

One Package of Japanese Pessaries, 86 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1936) (often just U.S. v. One Package), was an in rem United States Court of Appeals case in the Second Circuit involving birth control. Background In 1873 Congress adopted the Comstock Act, which prohibited the importation or mailing of \\"obscene matter\\". The law's definition of obscene matter included contraceptives or information about contraception. In the 1930s, Margaret Sanger and the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control lobbied Congress to revise this law, but were unsuccessful. The case Dr. Hannah Stone, at one of Sanger's clinics, ordered a new type of diaphragm (a pessary) from a Japanese physician to be shipped from Tokyo to the United States. Upon arrival in the United States the shipment was seized and confiscated under the Tariff Act of 1930, which had incorporated the anti- contraceptive provisions of the Comstock Act. A lower court ruled against the government. When the government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the appellate court affirmed the lower court's ruling. The appellate court held that the law could not be used to intercept shipments which originated from a doctor.

As a result, two cabins plunged into the sea, killing seven people. The oil rig was being towed away from Keppel Wharf when it became entangled in the cable and caused it to snap. It also left thirteen people trapped in four other cabins between Mount Faber and Sentosa. The disaster was the first involving death or injury since the cable car system opened in February 1974. Rescue operations The Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Fire Service (now Singapore Civil Defence Force) and all three services of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) were involved in the all-night rescue operation. It was headed by Philip Yeo, then Second Permanent Secretary (Defence). The overall operation was directed by Colonel Lee Hsien Loong, later the Prime Minister of Singapore. There were fears that the oil rig could drift further and cause more damage. The problem was worsened by a combination of strong currents and the rising tide (high tide was at 11 pm). To prevent the rig from moving, four tugs put lines aboard and worked to and fro in the water to keep the rig steady in the water. The Naval Diving Unit of the Republic of Singapore Navy was assigned to conduct the underwater search for the passengers in the two cabins which had plunged into the sea. It took the unit three hours before they recovered four bodies from the cabins. On land, the Army established an operations HQ and medical facilities at the wharf- side. In the air, the 120 Squadron of Republic of Singapore Air Force was tasked to rescue the people who were still trapped in the four cabins, as the cabins could not be moved along the remaining cables. Though an extremely risky measure, it was considered the fastest and safest way as the cabins might have plunged into the sea at any moment. The first Bell 212 Twin-Huey Search and rescue helicopter from the squadron (call sign Rescue One Zero) was piloted by Lieutenant Kao Yit Chee, fitted with floodlights, approached the first stranded cabin and despite the strong winds and danger, the winch operator - SSG Ramasamy Veerappan winched down the winchman ‚Äì Lance Corporal Phua Kim Hai. He was blown off on the first attempt but on the second attempt, he reached the door of the cabin, unlocked it and went inside. He came out with the first passenger strapped to his body by a harness. The winch operator pulled both of them to safety. The riskiest rescues were undertaken by Royal Australian Navy Lieutenant Geoff Ledger, who was on loan to RSAF to help train helicopter pilots. Despite the windy condition encountered above the harbour and the strong downwash of the rescue helicopter's main rotors, he managed to pilot the second Bell 212 rescue helicopter close above the cars to allow winchman Lance Corporal Selvanathan Selvarajoo to enter two cabins hanging only by their towline. Reproduced with additional commentary in Overall, the entire rescue mission took three and a half hours in darkness and high wind conditions. Aftermath A Commission of Inquiry was appointed by the President of the Republic of Singapore on 5 February 1983 into the disaster. The Commission conducted the Inquiry in public for 55 days from 23 May to 12 August 1983 and submitted its report on 30 December 1983. The report blamed the collision on the negligence of several parties, including the master, chief officer, and pilot of the Eniwetok. The Port of Singapore Authority, the shipyard and the oil rig's operators were also cited. The Commission made recommendations for appropriate safety measures to be taken to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.

The Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv), commonly known as the Conventual Franciscans, or Minorites, is a Catholic branch of the Franciscans who were founded by Francis of Assisi in 1209. Background A Conventual Franciscan in Brazil The Order of Friars Minor Conventual (or Conventual Franciscans), is a mendicant Catholic religious order. It is one of three separate fraternities that make up the First Order of St. Francis, that is, the friars. The Second Order is the Poor Clares, an order of women; members of the Third Order may be men or women, secular or regular. It is not entirely clear how the term \\"Conventual\\" arose. In the Bull Cum tamquam veri of 5 April 1250, Pope Innocent IV decreed that Franciscan churches where convents existed might be called Conventual churches, and some have maintained that the name \\"Conventual\\" was first given to the religious residing in such convents. Another view holds that word conventualis was used to distinguish the residents of large convents from those who lived more after the manner of hermits. (Although in modern usage \\"convents\\" are generally understood to mean in particular the home of female religious, just as monastery denotes that of men, originally \\"convent\\" referred to the entire community of a monastic establishment.) The Order of Friars Minor Conventual is spread throughout the world, and as of August 2018 includes 30 provinces, 18 custodies, 460 friaries and 4048 friars. There are four provinces of Conventual Franciscans in the United States. Friars serve in parishes, schools, and as chaplains for the military and for other religious orders; they serve in various types of homes and shelters, and with Catholic Relief Services. Particular characteristics of the Conventuals' tradition are community life and the urban apostolate. History Friars are different from monks in that they are called to live the evangelical counsels (vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience) in service to society, rather than through cloistered asceticism. In the life of the friar, the exercise of public ministry is an essential feature, for which the life of the cloister is considered as but an immediate preparation. Whereas monks live in a self- sufficient community, friars work among laypeople and were supported, at least initially, by donations or other charitable support. A monk or nun often takes an additional vow of \\"stability\\", committing themselves to a particular community in a particular place. Friars commit to a community spread across a wider geographical area known as a province, and so they may move, spending time in different houses of the community within their province.Cleary, Gregory. \\"Friar.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 22 December 2017 While monasteries had a tradition of assisting the poor and the sick, and provided access to religious services, as people began to move into towns, it was the friars that had the flexibility to relocate there. Even during the early days of the Franciscans a difference of opinion developed in the community concerning the interpretation of the rule regarding poverty. Towards the end of Francis' life, there was a growing trend for the brothers to live in larger communities (‚Äúconvents‚Äù) and to be engaged in pastoral work, particularly in the cities. As the order grew, the literal and unconditional observance of poverty came to appear impracticable by the great expansion of the order, its pursuit of learning, and the accumulated property of the large cloisters in the towns.Bihl, Michael. \\"Order of Friars Minor\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 21 December 2017 Some favored a relaxation in the rigor of the rule, especially as regards the observance of poverty, and others preferred to keep to its literal strictness. The tendency towards relaxation became more marked after the death of Francis in 1226, and was encouraged by his successor, Brother Elias. A long dispute followed in which the ‚ÄúFriars of the Community‚Äù, who had adopted certain mitigations, gradually came to be called Conventuals, while those who were zealous for the strict observance of the rule were called Zelanti, and afterwards named Observants. After the death of the Minister General, Bonaventure, in 1274, the Order grew even more divided between the ‚ÄúConventuals‚Äù, who had been given permission to have their communities in the cities in order to preach the Gospel and be of service to the poor, and that of the ‚ÄúZealots‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpirituals‚Äù, later known as ‚ÄúObservants‚Äù who emphasized absolute poverty and the eremitical and ascetical dimensions of Franciscanism.\\"History\\", Curia OFMConv Notwithstanding this division in the order, formally sanctioned in 1415 by the Council of Constance, both Observants and Conventuals continued to form one body under the same head until 1517. In that year Pope Leo X called a general chapter of the whole order at Rome, with a view to effecting a reunion between the Observants and Conventuals. The former agreed but requested permission to observe the rule without any dispensation; the latter declared they did not wish for the union if it entailed their renouncing the dispensations they had received from the Holy See. Leo X thereupon incorporated with the Observants all the Franciscan friars who wished to observe the rule without dispensation, abolishing the different denominations of Clareni, Colletani, etc.; he decreed that the members thus united should be called simply Friars Minor of St. Francis, or Friars Minor of the Regular Observance, and should have precedence over the Conventuals; he moreover conferred upon the Observants the right of electing the minister general, who was to bear the title of Minister General of the Whole Order of Friars Minor. Those who continued to live under dispensations were constituted a separate body with the name of Conventuals (Bulls Omnipotens Deus, 12 June 1517, and Licet Alias, 6 Dec. 1517) and given the right to elect a master general of their own, whose election, however, had to be confirmed by the Minister General of the Friars Minor. The latter appears never to have availed himself of this right, and the Conventuals may be regarded as an entirely independent order from 1517, but it was not until 1580 that they obtained a special cardinal protector of their own. In 1565 the Conventuals accepted the Tridentine indult allowing mendicant orders to own property corporately, and their chapter held at Florence in that year drew up statutes containing several important reforms which Pope Pius IV subsequently approved. In 1625 new constitutions were adopted by the Conventuals which superseded all preceding ones. These constitutions, which were subsequently promulgated by Pope Urban VIII, are known as the \\"Constitutiones Urban√¶\\" and are of importance, since at their profession the Conventuals vow to observe the Rule of St. Francis in accordance with them, that is to say, by admitting the duly authorized dispensations therein set forth. In 1897, Pope Leo XIII reorganized the Franciscan Orders, giving each its own Minister General. Apostolate The Conventuals enjoy the privilege of caring for the tomb of St. Francis at Assisi and that of St. Anthony at the Basilica in Padua, and they furnish the penitentiaries to the Vatican Basilica. The Order of Friars Minor Conventual sought to spread the ideals of Saint Francis throughout the new urban social order of the Middle Ages. Some friars settled in the urban slums, or the suburbs of the medieval neighbourhoods where the huts and shacks of the poorest were built outside the safety of the city walls. In London, the first settlement of the friars was set in what was called \\"Stinking Lane\\". Since the suburbs were also the place where hospitals were set up, the friars were often commissioned by the city government to facilitate the care of the sick. The friars also helped to construct sturdier buildings, replacing the previous huts, and constructed churches. Robert Grosseteste, then Bishop of Lincoln, marvelled that the people \\"run to the friars for instruction as well as for confession and direction. They are transforming the world.\\" The \\"Friars of the Community\\" sought to take Francis's ideals to the far reaches of a universal Church. After the founder's death, they began the task of translating Francis's earthly existence into what they saw as a more socially relevant spiritual message for current and future generations. The Conventual Franciscans nestled their large group homes into small areas of land surrounded by poverty. They used their abilities to combat the hardships and injustices of the poverty-stricken areas where they settled. Habit The habit of the Conventuals consists of a serge tunic fastened around the waist with a thin white cord, along with a large cape which is round in front and pointed behind with a small hood attached. The color may be either black, which was adopted during the French revolution, dark grey, or light grey which is worn by friars in East Africa.

Orizu was also Acting President of Nigeria from late 1965 until the military coup of January 1966. He was a member of the Nnewi Royal family. His nephew Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III is the current Igwe (King) of Nnewi Kingdom. Nwafor Orizu College of Education in Nsugbe, Anambra State, is named after him.\\"About Nocen\\", Nwafor Orizu College of Education, Nsugbe, Anambra State. Background Orizu was born in 1914 into the royal house of Nnewi, Anambra State, in southeast Nigeria, a son of Eze Ugbonyamba, Igwe Orizu I. Orizu went to the United States in 1939, earning a degree in government at Ohio State University and an M.A. degree at Columbia University. He was an advocate of the \\"horizontal\\", broad system of American education, as opposed to the narrow \\"perpendicular\\" British system, and earned the nickname \\"Orizontal\\", a play on his name and a reference to his constant discussion of the theme. As discussed in his 1944 book, Without Bitterness, he was a passionate advocate of introducing the American system to Nigeria. He established The American Council on African Education (ACAE), which obtained numerous tuition scholarships from American sources for the benefit of African students. Around 1949, Orizu bought the Enitona High School and Enitona printing press from a supporter for only ¬£500, which he borrowed. Another supporter sold him a luxury bus on an installment plan. He established a newspaper known as The West Africa Examiner and became the managing director, while M. C. K. Ajuluchukwu was the editor. Orizu went to Enugu to console the striking miners after the shooting of 21 miners on 18 November 1949. Possibly in reaction to a fiery speech that he made there, the British colonial authorities sentenced him to seven years in jail for allegedly misappropriating the funds of the ACAE. But later Roy Wilkins, chairman of ACAE in the US, wrote a letter to Nnamdi Azikiwe (\\"Zik\\") exonerating Dr Nwafor Orizu of any financial impropriety. Prison sentence In September 1953, Orizu was convicted by a Nigerian magistrate on seven counts of fraud and theft of funds intended for student scholarships at American universities. He was later subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison. Political career Orizu ran successfully for election as an independent candidate to represent Onitsha Division, and became the chief whip in the Eastern House of Assembly. Later he joined with other independent candidates to form the National Council of Nigeria and Cameroon (NCNC). He played a central role in helping Zik become premier of the Eastern Region, using his influence in the NCNC to persuade Professor Eyo Ita to resign as premier of the Region. Zik appointed Orizu the minister of local Government. When Nigeria attained independence on 1 October 1960, Orizu became the President of the Nigerian Senate. Military coup The President of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe left the country in late 1965 first for Europe, then on a cruise to the Caribbean. Under the law, Orizu became Acting President during his absence and had all the powers of the President. A coup was launched on 16 January 1966 by a group of disaffected young military officers led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu. The army quickly suppressed the revolt but assumed power when it was evident that key politicians had been eliminated, including Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier of Northern Region Sir Ahmadu Bello and Premier of the Western Region, Chief Samuel Ladoke Akintola. Orizu made a nationwide broadcast, after he had briefed Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe on the phone on the decision of the cabinet, announcing the cabinet's \\"voluntary\\" decision to transfer power to the armed forces. Major General Johnson Aguiyi- Ironsi then made his own broadcast, accepting the \\"invitation\\". On 17 January, Major General Ironsi established the Supreme Military Council in Lagos and effectively suspended the constitution. Later career After the coup, Orizu faded from the political scene but remained active in education. Before the civil war he had set up a high school, the Nigerian Secondary School, in Nnewi. He remained its proprietor until the state government took over all the schools after the defeat of Biafra. After that he continued as a teacher and an educator, publishing several books. Also, between 1974 and 1975, the government of the defunct East Central State, led by Dr. Ukpabi Asika, appointed him the Chairman of the State's Teachers' Service Commission in Enugu.

Diamond plate is usually steel, stainless steel or aluminum. Steel types are normally made by hot rolling, although modern manufacturers also make a raised and pressed diamond design. The added texture reduces the risk of slipping, making diamond plate a solution for stairs, catwalks, walkways, and ramps in industrial settings. Its non-skid properties mean that diamond plate is frequently used on the interior of ambulances and on the footplates of firetrucks. Additional applications include truck beds and trailer floors. Diamond plate can also be used decoratively, particularly highly polished aluminum variants. Manufactured in plastic, diamond plate is marketed as an interlocking tile system to be installed on garage floors, trailers, and exercise rooms. Diamond plate may be used for surface protection against damage from foot traffic or harmful chemicals. Manufactured with polymer variants, inter-locking diamond plate tile is used in areas with high surface-erosive traffic. \\"Diamond plate\\" can also refer to similar anti-slip textures. The design of diamond plate flooring was the model for the 1979 Talking Heads album Fear of Music, which used embossed cardboard on the LP cover art to mimic the texture of the flooring.

It is important for such a system to model user's preferences accurately, find hidden preferences and avoid redundancy. This problem is sometimes studied as a computational learning theory problem. Another approach for formulating this problem is a partially observable Markov decision process. The formulation of this problem is also dependent upon the context of the area in which it is studied. Overview With the explosion of on-line information new opportunities for finding and using electronic data have been generated, these changes have also brought the task of eliciting useful information to the forefront. Researchers as well as major online catalog companies have come up with algorithms and prototypes of systems that can aid a user to be able to navigate through a complex and huge information space using some information from the user in the form of answers to certain queries or ratings to certain items etc. depending upon the domain of the information space.

It is a resident breeder throughout South America from Colombia to southern Argentina and Chile, and on the offshore islands from the Grenadines southwards. It may be a relatively recent colonist of Tobago and Trinidad. It appears to be partially migratory, its movements driven by food supplies. It is a close relative of the North American mourning dove. With that species, the Socorro dove, and possibly the Gal√°pagos dove it forms a superspecies. The latter two are insular offshoots, the Socorro birds from ancestral mourning doves, the Gal√°pagos ones from more ancient stock. Description The eared dove is long with a long wedge-shaped tail, and weighs normally about . Adult males have mainly olive-brown upperpart plumage, with black spots on the wings. The head has a grey crown, black line behind the eye, and the blue-black on the lower ear coverts. These black markings give the species its English and specific name. The underparts are vinous, and the tail is tipped with cinnamon. The bill is black and the legs dark red. The female is duller than the male, and immature birds are greyish-brown, very dull, with pale barring. The species' call is a deep soft oo-ah-oo. Ecology Adult and chicks in Uruguay The eared dove is common to abundant in savannahs and other open areas, including cultivation, and it readily adapts to human habitation, being seen on wires and telephone posts near towns in Trinidad and Venezuela, almost in all public spaces of large urban areas such as Bogot√°, Colombia and feeding near beach resorts in Tobago. Eared doves feed mainly on seed taken from the ground. They can be agricultural pests. This is a gregarious bird when not feeding, and forms flocks especially at migration time or at communal roosts. Its flight is high, fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It also has a breeding display with a steep climb and semi-circular glide down to its original perch. It builds a small stick nest several meters up in a tree and lays two white eggs. These hatch in 12‚Äì14 days with another 9 days to fledging. There appears to be no fixed breeding season in most of their range, and provided with plentiful food and habitat birds will breed almost continuously. Hunting Eared doves provide the last big-bag shooting experience in the world. There are reckoned to be more than 23 million of these doves in the fields around C√≥rdoba in northern Argentina, and recent estimates put the figure in the 32 million range. It is not unknown for a single gun to shoot 1000 birds in a day. The scale of this wing-shooting recalls the numbers of passenger pigeons taken by North American gunners in the 1800s. That hunting pressure brought the passenger pigeon to rapid extinction, but the eared dove seems to be more resilient. Indeed, as with the passenger pigeons, eared dove populations in Argentina and Bolivia sometimes \\"darken the skies\\". Thus, it seems that populations on the sporting estates of Argentina are holding their own, with the birds breeding four times a year and thriving on the vast areas of grain, some grown for their benefit, most of it on commercial farms which are happy to support the dove shooting. There are dozens of luxury lodges which specialize in dove hunting, and the season extends all year long. The eared doves around C√≥rdoba do not migrate, and the enormous flocks are described as flying constantly between their roosting woods and the open fields. In the C√≥rdoba region in Argentina the eared doves are known as palomas doradas because of the shining feathers sometimes present in their plumage. Further north, in Bolivia, around de Gran Chaco region, near the immense soy and sorghum plantations around Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the dove shooting is more seasonal, going from May to September with large flocks arriving from Argentina to raid the grain crops. Locals attest that eared doves, which they call by the Guaran√≠ name of totaky were quite rare in the region just a couple of decades ago, a testimony not only to the resilience of the species but to the huge impact that the newly created large feeding grounds have on dove populations.

It has been held annually since 1988, and draws competitors from throughout New Zealand and around the world. Around 450 runners enter the event with nearly all completing the demanding course. Route Starting at the Control Gates of Lake Te Anau the route follows an easy first 6 km before it takes a steady climb to the Luxmore Hut. The next 12 km offer wonderful views of the South Fiord along the undulating tops before a spectacular descent to the Iris Burn Hut. A gradual 17 km journey down the Iris Burn brings competitors to the Moturau Hut on Lake Manapouri and from there a 6 km run to the last checkpoint at Rainbow Reach. The home straight follows alongside the Waiau River and back to the Control Gates. Alpine running section of the track Records In 2013 the men's record was beaten by Martin Dent with a time of 4h33m37s surpassing the record of 4h37m41s was which held by Phil Costley, who in December 2005 beat Russell Hurring's previous record of 4h41m32s (set in 1993). Zelah Morrall smashed the women's race record repeatedly, last in 2003 by a further 10 minutes her best time being 5h23m34s. A number of competitors should complete the course in less than 5 hours. Others may take up to 11 hours. As of 2006, Murray Thomas, an engineer from Alexandra has run in and completed all 19 Kepler Challenges, while Alan Reid, a school teacher from Greymouth at the time (now Lumsden), and Peter Dunne, who works for Badminton NZ, have each run 18. From 2010‚Äì2012 Vajin Armstrong finished first three years in a row. Ruby Muir has been the first female finisher six times. In 2009, one of the competitors, Malcolm Law, completed the run as the last stage in a \\"7-in-7 challenge\\", in which he became the first person to run all of New Zealand's 7 Great Walks in 7 days (a total of 360 km, or 9 marathons), in aid of the Leukemia and Blood Foundation of New Zealand. Also in 2009, Murray Thomas returned from overseas to complete his 21st challenge, Ray Willett (Te Anau) completed his 21st challenge and Alan Reid completed his 21st event from 22 starts (Alan withdrew during the 2006 event due to injury/knee surgery issues). Finish line of the Kepler Challenge and Luxmore Grunt events. Community support Such an event requires a large support team to operate the checkpoints, provide communications, first aid and other services. Nearly 200 local people contribute in some way to ensure that the event runs smoothly. Thousands of voluntary hours go into organising the race but it is worth all the effort to make it a major highlight on the Fiordland Calendar. The event organised by the Kepler Challenge Organising Committee which is a non profit organisation. Luxmore Grunt The Luxmore Grunt is held on the same race day as the Kepler Challenge but is much shorter being only 27 km in distance. Competitors follow the same route starting at the control gates but then turn around at Luxmore Hut and head back down to the start/finish line. This event was limited to 150 runners annually but since 2013 has been increased to 200 because of its growing popularity.

As part of the album, the song is featured in the film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Composition As documented in the Discovery liner notes, the song features a sample of \\"I Love You More\\" by George Duke.

Thomas Bangalter revealed that the solo was created using a mixture of elements, aided by music sequencers. \\"No one plays solos in their songs anymore, but we wanted to include some on the album.\\" Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo also noted the duo's use of in-studio equipment to evoke the sound of a previous artist: Music video The video was released in 2001 and would later appear as part the 2003 anime film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Immediately following the events that occurred in the \\"Aerodynamic\\" video, the alien planet's security guards regain enough consciousness to send a distress signal to a distant astronaut named Shep. At first, Shep is seen cleaning his spaceship's exterior while singing along with the song's lyrics. After completing the task, he returns to the ship and lounges around in his bedroom, filled with memorabilia of the alien band. He drifts into a daydream where he dances with his crush, the band's female bass player (later named Stella), in mid-air. Shep's dream comes to an abrupt halt when he is awakened by the distress signal sent to him. To his horror, he learns of the band's abduction and current state of the alien planet, immediately pursuing after the kidnappers. After the chase leads through a warp hole, the kidnappers make a safe landing with the unconscious alien band at their base on Earth, with Shep crash-landing into a nearby forest, temporarily rendering him unconscious. The kidnappers take the sedated captives into the base's lab for the events that take place in the \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" video. Reception \\"Digital Love\\" charted backed with \\"Aerodynamic\\" due to equal club play. It charted at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and made number 9 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the United States.

The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto- Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant.Hall 1960: 8‚Äì10 The thousand-year period, often referred to as the Pyu millennium, linked the Bronze Age to the beginning of the classical states period when the Pagan Kingdom emerged in the late 9th century. The city- states‚Äîfive major walled cities and several smaller towns have been excavated‚Äîwere all located in the three main irrigated regions of Upper Burma: the Mu River Valley, the Kyaukse plains and Minbu region, around the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Part of an overland trade route between China and India, the Pyu realm gradually expanded south. Halin, founded in the 1st century AD at the northern edge of Upper Burma, was the largest and most important city until around the 7th or 8th century when it was superseded by Sri Ksetra (near modern Pyay) at the southern edge. Twice as large as Halin, Sri Ksetra was the largest and most influential Pyu centre. The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on the Culture of Burma and political organisation.Myint-U 2006: 51‚Äì52 The Pyu calendar, based on the Buddhist calendar, later became the Burmese calendar. Recent scholarship, though yet not settled, suggests that the Pyu script, based on the Indian Tamil language Brahmi script, may have been the source of the Burmese script used to write the Burmese language. The millennium-old civilisation came crashing down in the 9th century when the city-states were destroyed by repeated invasions from the Kingdom of Nanzhao. The Bamar people, who came from Nanzhao, set up a garrison town at Bagan at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma for the next three centuries but the Pyu gradually were absorbed into the expanding Pagan Kingdom. The Pyu language still existed until the late 12th century. By the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed the Burman ethnicity. The histories and legends of the Pyu were also incorporated to those of the Bamar. Only the city-states of Halin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, where the other sites can be added in the future for an extension nomination. Background Based on limited archaeological evidence, it is inferred that the earliest cultures existed in Burma as early as 11,000 BCE, mainly in the central dry zone close to the Irrawaddy. The Anyathian, Burma's Stone Age, existed around the same time as the lower and middle Paleolithic eras in Europe. Three caves located near Taunggyi at the foothills of the Shan Hills have yielded Neolithic artefacts dated 10-6000 BCE.Cooler 2002: Chapter I: Prehistoric and Animist Periods About 1500 BCE, people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice, and domesticating chickens and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so. By 500 BCE, iron-working settlements emerged in an area south of present-day Mandalay. Bronze-decorated coffins and burial sites filled with earthenware remains have been excavated.Myint-U 2006: 45 Archaeological evidence at Samon River Valley south of Mandalay suggests rice-growing settlements that traded with China between 500 BCE and 200 CE.Hudson 2005: 1 Circa 2nd century BCE, the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people began to enter the Irrawaddy River Valley from present-day Yunnan using the Tapain and Shweli Rivers. The original home of the Pyu is reconstructed to be Qinghai Lake, which is located in the present-day provinces of Qinghai and Gansu.Moore 2007: 236 The Pyu, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant, went on to found settlements throughout the plains region centred on the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers that has been inhabited since the Paleolithic.Aung-Thwin 2005: 16 The Pyu realm was longer than wide, stretching from Sri Ksetra in the south to Halin in the north, Binnaka and Maingmaw to the east and probably Ayadawkye to the west. The Tang dynasty's records report 18 Pyu states, nine of which were walled cities, covering 298 districts.Aung-Thwin 2005: 327 Archaeology The Pyu were the earliest people in Southeast Asia to welcome in and adapt to Indie scripts in order to record their tonal language, inventing tonal markers. The Pyu shared a type of urbanism on a wide variety of scales. They had walled spaces with one side sealed by a water tank or a tank outside of the walls. In late prehistory, the Pyu settled for quite some time in Beikthano in the Yin River Valley than the Nawin River Valley at Sri Ksetra, because they proved their skills of water control using irrigation systems depended on their good knowledge of the conditions in each locality and area. According to Stargardt in ‚ÄúFrom the Iron Age to early cities at Srikestra and Beikthano, Myanmar‚Äù Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, all the archaeology found a lot of major inscriptions on stone in phy language survive at Sri Kestra (Pyu), Hanlin and near Pinle (Hmainmaw), and Bagan. They have strong evidence on the people were living in that century between the third-fourth and fifth-sixth centuries CE. All the record was nominated by World Heritage UNESCO and other historians. In this article, it mentioned and written also \\"Pyu\\" were among the earlies people in Southeast Asia. As Stargardt acknowledges in that article, \\"Sri Kestra\\" contained fields, irrigation canals, water tanks and iron-working sites, as well as monuments, markets (and elusive habitation areas) both inside and outside walls, all these halls also provide evidence of a powerful belief system in the elaborate provision of the dead‚Äù. In that article, the author adds upon his research in other's article, they also recorded old photo of founded place which is already surveyed in nine major burial terraces outside the southern city walls, old Buddhist monuments including the complex at \\"Beikthano\\" city and the queen \\"Panhtwar\\" cemetery. Archaeological surveys have actually so far unearthed 12 walled cities, including five large walled cities, and several smaller non-fortified settlements, located at or near the three most important irrigated regions of precolonial Burma: the Mu River Valley in the north, the Kyaukse plains in centre, and the Minbu region in the south and west of the former two.Aung-Thwin 2005: 18‚Äì19 The city-states were contemporaries of the Kingdom of Funan (Cambodia) and (perhaps) Champa (southern Vietnam), Dvaravati (Thailand), Tambralinga and Takuapa near the Kra Isthmus, and Srivijaya (southeast Sumatra). All these statelets foreshadowed the rise of the \\"classical kingdoms\\" of Southeast Asia in the second millennium CE.Aung-Thwin 2005: 25‚Äì26 Decline of Pyu city-states It was a long-lasting civilisation that lasted nearly a millennium to the early 9th century until a new group of \\"swift horsemen\\" from the north, the (Mranma) (Burmans) of the Nanzhao Kingdom entered the upper Irrawaddy valley through a series of raids. According to the Tang Dynasty chronicles, the Nanzhao began their raids of Upper Burma starting as early as 754Harvey 1925: 13‚Äì15 or 760. By 763, the Nanzhao king Ko-lo-feng had conquered the upper Irrawaddy Valley. Nanzhao raids intensified in the 9th century, with the Nanzhao raiding in 800‚Äì802, and again in 808‚Äì809. Finally, according to the Chinese, in 832, the Nanzhao warriors overran the Pyu country, and took away 3000 Pyu prisoners from Halin. (In 835, the Chinese records say the Nanzhao also raided a state, generally identified by some but not universally accepted to be a Pyu state.) To be sure, the Pyu and their culture did not disappear just because 3000 of them were taken away. The size of the Pyu realm and its many walled cities throughout the land indicates a population many times over. Indeed, no firm indications at Sri Ksetra or at any other Pyu site exist to suggest a violent overthrow. It is more likely that these raids significantly weakened the Pyu states, enabling the Burmans to move into Pyu territories. At any rate, evidence shows that the actual pace of Burman migration into the Pyu realm was gradual. Radiocarbon dating shows that human activity existed until c. 870 at Halin, the subject of the 832 Nanzhao raid.Aung-Thwin 2005: 36‚Äì37 The Burmese chronicles claim the Burmans founded the fortified city of Pagan (Bagan) in 849 but the oldest radiocarbon dated evidence at Pagan (old walls) points to 980 CE while the main walls point to circa 1020 CE, just 24 years earlier than the beginning of the reign of Anawrahta, the founder of Pagan Empire.Aung- Thwin 2005: 38 At any rate, the Burmans had overtaken the leadership of the Pyu realm by the late 10th century, and went on to found the Pagan Empire in the middle of the 11th century, unifying the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery for the first time. Nonetheless, the Pyu had left an indelible mark on Pagan whose Burman rulers would incorporate the histories and legends of the Pyu as their own. The Burman kings of Pagan claimed descent from the kings of Sri Ksetra and Tagaung as far back as 850 BCE‚Äîa claim dismissed by most modern scholars.Hall 1960: 7 Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma for the next three centuries but the Pyu gradually were absorbed and assimilated into the expanding Pagan Empire. The Pyu language still existed until the late 12th century but by the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed the Burman ethnicity and disappeared into history. City-states Pyu realm circa 800 CE, before the advent of the Mranma Of the 12 walled cities excavated thus far, five are the remains of largest Pyu states: Beikthano, Maingmaw, Binnaka, Halin and Sri Ksetra. =Beikthano= Beikthano ( ) situated in the irrigated Minbu region (near present-day Taungdwingyi) with direct land access to the well-watered Kyaukse plains to its northeast, is the oldest urban site so far discovered and scientifically excavated site. Its remains‚Äîthe structures, pottery, artefacts, and human skeletons‚Äîdate from 200 BCE to 100 CE. Named after the Hindu god Vishnu, the city may be the first capital of a culturally and perhaps even politically uniform state in the history of Burma. It was a large fortified settlement, measuring approximately 300 hectares inside the rectangular (3 km by 1 km) walls. The walls and fortifications along it measured six meters thick, and are radiocarbon dated to a period between 180 BCE and 610 CE. Like most subsequent cities, the main entrance of the walls led to the palace, which faced east. Stupas and monastic buildings have also been excavated within the city walls.Aung-Thwin 1996: 77 =Maingmaw= Maingmaw ( ; also Mong Mao and Mongamo), located in the Kyaukse region, was circular in shape, and has tentatively been dated to the first millennium BCE. At 2.5 km in diameter and 222 hectares, Maingmaw is one of the largest ancient cities on the entire Kyaukse plains. It has two inner enclosure walls, the outer of which is square while the inner one is circular. The plan of a circle within a square suggest a zodiac sign which represents a view of the heavens from the perspective of the sun, the manner in which 19th century Mandalay was also conceptualised. At almost dead centre, a 19th-century temple called Nandawya Paya, which was probably built upon the ruins of an ancient one. The city is bisected by a canal, thought to be contemporary to the city, though no scientific dating has confirmed it. Excavations‚Äîthe first of which was carried out in 1979‚Äîhave unearthed many artefacts, including jewellery, silver coins, and funerary urns. Many of the artefacts such as the coins and funerary urns are virtually identical to those found Beikthano and Binnaka. =Binnaka= Binnaka ( ) too was located in the Kyaukse region, and virtually identical to its neighbour Maingmaw in numerous ways. Its brick structures shared the same floor plan as those found at Beikthano and other Pyu sites. Excavations have recovered pre-Buddhist artefacts, gold necklaces, precious stone images of elephants, turtles and lions, distinctive Pyu pottery, terracotta tablets with writing that strongly resembled the Pyu script, and various kinds of acid- etched onyx beads along with others made of amber and jade. Also excavated are distinctive silver coins identical to those found at Beikthano and Binnaka, stone moulds for casting silver and gold ornamental flowers, a gold armlet in association with a silver bowl that has Pyu writing on it, and funerary urns virtually identical to those found Beikthano and Binnaka. Both Maingmaw and Binnaka may have been contemporary of Beikthano. The chronicles, which do not mention Beikthano at all, do mention the two, though not specifically as Pyu cities. The chronicles state that the ruler of Binnaka was responsible for the fall of Tagaung, the city identified by the chronicles as the original home of Burmese speakers.Aung-Thwin 2005: 328 Binnaka was inhabited until about the 19th century, according to a Konbaung era palm-leaf sittan (record) discovered there. =Halin= right Halin or Halingyi ( ), located in the Mu valley, one of the largest irrigated regions of precolonial Burma, is the northernmost Pyu city so far discovered. The earliest artefacts of Halin‚Äîcity's wooden gates‚Äîare radiocarbon dated to 70 CE. The city was rectangular but with curved corners, and brick-walled. Excavated walls are approximately 3.2 km long on the north‚Äìsouth axis and 1.6 km on the east‚Äìwest. At 664 hectares, the city was nearly twice the size of Beikthano. It has four main gates at the cardinal points, and a total of 12 gates, based on the zodiac. A river or canal ran through the city. Traces of a moat exist on all sides except the south, where it was probably not needed, as land was dammed there to create reservoirs. This design of the city influenced the city planning of later Burmese cities and the Siamese city of Sukhothai. For example, the number of gates and configuration was also found in subsequent major Burmese capitals such as the 11th century Pagan and 19th century Mandalay. The city's configuration was also found at other contemporary cities such as Maingmaw and Beikthano in the Pyu realm and Danyawaddy and Wethali in Arakan as well as later cities such as Sukhothai, which emerged over a millennium later. Structural remains of temples at Halin show that the design of city's temples influenced the 11th to 13th century temples at Pagan. Excavated artefacts point to Halin's Pyu script to be the earliest writing in the Pyu realm (and in Burma). It was based on an earlier version of the Brahmi script (Mauryan and Guptan). Inscriptions at Sri Ksetra show a later version of the same script.Aung-Thwin 2005: 21‚Äì23 Known for the production of salt, a highly prized commodity in the first millennium, Halin was superseded by Sri Ksetra as the premier Pyu city-state circa 7th century. By the Chinese accounts, Halin remained an important Pyu centre until the 9th century when the Pyu realm came under repeated attacks from the Nanzhao Kingdom. The Chinese records state that the city was destroyed by the Nanzhao warriors in 832 CE, with 3000 of its inhabitants taken away. However, radiocarbon dating reveals human activity to about 870 CE, nearly four decades after the reported sack of the city. =Sri Ksetra= Bawbawgyi Pagoda at Sri Ksetra, prototype of Pagan-era pagodas Sri Ksetra or Thaye Khittaya ( ; lit., \\"Field of Fortune\\"Htin Aung 1967: 8 or \\"Field of Glory\\"), located 8 km southeast of Prome (Pyay) at present-day Hmawza village,Thein, Myanmar Times was the last and southernmost Pyu capital. The city was founded between the 5th and 7th centuries,although during two of the recent excavations, January to February 2015 and December 2015 to February 2016, led by Janice Stargardt in Yahanda mound at Sri Ksetra, sherds stamped with Buddhist motifs were found, dated from c. 340 +/- 30 CE. and Pyu culture cremation burials around 270 +/- 30 CE. Sri Ksetra likely overtook Halin as the premier Pyu city by the 7th or 8th century, and retained that status until the Mranma arrived in the 9th century. The city was home to at least two dynasties, and maybe three. The first dynasty, called the Vikrama Dynasty, is believed to have launched the Pyu calendar, which later became the Burmese calendar, on 22 March 638. The second dynasty was founded by King Duttabaung on 25 March 739 (11th waxing of Tagu 101 ME).Aung-Thwin 2005: 24‚Äì26 Sri Ksetra is the largest Pyu site discovered thus far. (Only Beikthano and Sri Ksetra have been extensively excavated. Other important Pyu cities as Maingmaw and Binnaka could yield more artefacts with more extensive excavations.) It occupied a larger area than that of the 11th century Pagan or 19th century Mandalay. Circular in design, Sri Ksetra was more than 13 km in circumference and three to four km across, or about 1400 hectares of occupied area. The city's brick walls were 4.5 meters high, and had 12 gates with huge devas (deities) guarding the entrances and a pagoda at each of the four corners. Sri Ksetra It also has curving gateways, such as those found at Halin and Beikthano. In the centre of the city was what most scholars think represented the rectangular palace site, 518 meters by 343 meters, symbolising both a mandala and a zata (horoscope), like in Maingmaw. Only the southern half of the city was taken up by the palace, monasteries and houses; the entire northern half consisted of rice fields. Together with the moats and walls, this arrangement ensured that the city could withstand a long siege by enemies.Htin Aung 1967: 10‚Äì11 Sri Ksetra was an important entrep√¥t between China and India. It was located on the Irrawaddy, not far from the sea as the Irrawaddy delta had not yet been formed. Ships from the Indian Ocean could come up to Prome to trade with the Pyu realm and China. Trade with India brought deep cultural contacts. Sri Ksetra has yielded the most extensive remains of Theravada Buddhism. Religious art suggests several distinct occupations with earlier influences stemming from Southeast India and later influences from Southwest India while 9th century influences include those from the Nanzhao Kingdom. Much of the Chinese account of the Pyu states was through Sri Ksetra. Chinese pilgrims Xuanzang in 648 and Yijing in 675 mentioned Sri Ksetra in their accounts of Buddhist kingdoms of Southeast Asia. The Tang histories mention the arrival at the court of an embassy from the Pyu capital in 801.Htin Aung 1967: 20‚Äì21 =Smaller settlements= Many Pyu settlements have been found across Upper Burma. They include Wati (an urban area west of Maingmaw), Ayadawkye Ywa in the Mu valley, west of Halin and south of a recently discovered Bronze Age site called Nyaunggan, and several others in Myinmu township, which controls the mouth of the Mu river. A small but politically significant Pyu site is Tagaung ( ) in northern Burma (about 200-km north of Mandalay) where Pyu artefacts including funerary urns have been excavated. The significance is due to the fact that the Burmese chronicles identify Tagaung as the home of the first Burmese kingdom.Htin Aung 1967: 7, 16 Aside from Beikthano and Sri Ksetra, most Pyu sites have not seen extensive or any excavation. The New History of the Tang states the kingdom of Mi-ch'en sent an embassy to China in 805, and was attacked by Nanchao in 835. Economy =Agriculture= The economy of the Pyu city states was based on agriculture and trade. All important Pyu settlements were located in the three main irrigated regions of Upper Burma, centred on the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers: Halin in the Mu valley, Maingmaw and Binnaka in the Kyaukse plains, finally Beikthano and Sri Ksetra at or near the Minbu district. (The irrigation projects of the Pyu were later picked up by the Burmans. King Anawrahta of Pagan would build irrigation projects in these three regions in the 1050s to turn them into the main rice granaries of Upper Burma. They would give Upper Burma an enduring economic base from which to dominate the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery in the following centuries.Harvey 1925: 24‚Äì25) The Pyu grew rice, perhaps of the Japonica variety.Aung-Thwin 2005: 26‚Äì27 =Trade= The Pyu realm was an important trading centre between China and India in the first millennium CE. Two main trading routes passed through the Pyu states. As early as 128 BCE, an overland trade route between China and India existed across the northern Burma. An embassy from the Roman Empire to China passed through this route in 97 CE and again in 120 CE.Htin Aung 1967: 7 But the majority of the trade was conducted by sea through the southern Pyu states, which at the time were located not far from the sea as much of the Irrawaddy delta had not yet been formed, and as far south as upper Tenasserim coast towns such as Winga, Hsindat-Myindat, Sanpannagon and Mudon where Pyu artefacts have been found. (It is insufficient to conclude however that the Pyu had administrative and military control over these upper Tenasserim coastal towns.)Aung-Thwin 2005: 29‚Äì30 The ports connected the overland trade route to China via present-day Yunnan. The trading area of the Pyu states spanned across the present-day Southeast Asia, South Asia and China. Artifacts from the 2nd century northwest India to Java and the Philippines have been found at Beikthano. Likewise, Pyu artefacts have been found along the coasts of Arakan, Lower Burma, and as far east as √ìc Eo (in present-day southern Vietnam).Aung-Thwin 2005: 18 The Pyu also conducted trade and diplomatic relations with China. In 800 and 801‚Äì802, Sri Ksetra sent a formal embassy, along with 35 musicians to the Tang court. According to the Chinese, the Pyu used gold and silver coinage. But only silver coins have survived.Htin Aung 1967: 13 =Currency= A notable feature of the Pyu states is the minting and use of silver coinage. Originated in the Pegu area, these coins date from the 5th century and were the model for most first millennium coinage in mainland Southeast Asia. The earliest type of these coins is not inscribed and depicts a conch on one side and a Srivatsa on the other. Many of the coins had a small hole along the perimeter, and may have also been used as amulets. Remarkably, after the use of coins ceased at the end of Pyu period in the late 9th century, coins did not reappear in the Burmese kingdoms until the 19th century.Cooler 2002: Chapter II The Pre-Pagan Period: The Urban Age of the Mon and the Pyu Culture =Religion= Avalokite≈õvara holding a lotus flower. Bihar, 9th century, CE. The Pyu followed a mix of religious traditions. The culture of Pyu city states was heavily influenced by India. Indian culture was most visible in the southern Pyu realm through which most trade with India was conducted by sea. The names of southernmost cities were in Pali or Sanskrit derived like Sri Ksetra (Thaye Khittaya) and Vishnu (Beikthano). The kings at Sri Ksetra titled themselves as Varmans and Varma. It was not just a southern phenomenon. To varying degrees, northern Pyu cities and towns also became under the sway of Indian culture. The Burmese chronicles claim that the founding kings of Tagaung were descended from no less than the Sakya clan of the Buddha himself.Aung-Thwin 2005: 31‚Äì34Htin Aung 1967: 15‚Äì17 By the 4th century, most of the Pyu had become predominantly Buddhist, though archaeological finds prove that their pre- Buddhist practices remained firmly entrenched in the following centuries. According to the excavated texts, as well as the Chinese records, the predominant religion of the Pyu was Theravada Buddhism. The Theravada school prevalent in the Pyu realm was probably derived from the Andhra region in southeast India, associated with the famous Theravada Buddhist scholar, Buddhagosa. It was the predominant Theravada school in Burma until the late 12th century when Shin Uttarajiva led the realignment with Ceylon's Mahavihara school.Harvey 1925: 55‚Äì56 The archaeological finds also indicate a widespread presence of Tantric Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism. Avalokite≈õvara (Lokanatha) (called Lawkanat in Burmese; ), Tara, Manusi Buddhas, Vai≈õrava·πáa, and Hayagriva, all prominent in Mahayana Buddhism, were very much part of Pyu (and later the Pagan) iconography scene. Various Hindu Brahman iconography ranging from the Hindu trinity, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, to Garuda and Lakshmi have been found, especially in Lower Burma. Non-Theravada practices such as ceremonial cattle sacrifice and alcohol consumption were main stays of the Pyu life. Likewise, the greater prominence of nuns and female students than in the later eras may point to pre-Buddhist notions of female autonomy.Lieberman 2003: 116‚Äì117 In melding of their pre-Buddhist practices to Buddhist ones, they placed the remains of their cremated dead in pottery and stone urns and buried them in or near isolated stupas, a practice consistent with early Buddhist practices of interring the remains of holy personages in stupas.Stargardt 1990: 200 Though their religious beliefs was a syncretic mix of many backgrounds, probably like in the early Pagan period, the outlook of the Pyu reportedly was largely peaceful. Tang Chinese records describe the Pyu as a humane and peaceful people to whom war was virtually unknown and who wore silk cotton instead of actually silk so that they would not have to kill silk worms, and that many Pyu boys entered the monastic life at seven to the age of 20.Htin Aung 1967: 12 To be sure, this peaceful description by the Chinese was a snapshot of the Pyu realm, and may not represent the life in the city-states in general. =Language and script= The Myazedi inscription c. 1112‚Äì1113 in Pyu The Pyu language was a Tibeto-Burman language, related to Old Burmese. But it apparently co-existed with Sanskrit and Pali as the court language. The Chinese records state that the 35 musicians that accompanied the Pyu embassy to the Tang court in 800‚Äì802 played music and sang in the Fan (Sanskrit) language. Many of the important inscriptions were written in Sanskrit and/or Pali, alongside the Pyu script. The Pyu sites have yielded a wide variety of Indian scripts from King Ashoka's edicts written in north Indian Brahmi and Tamil Brahmi, both dated to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, to the Gupta script and Kannada script dated to the 4th to 6th centuries CE.Aung-Thwin 2005: 35‚Äì36Harvey 1925: 4 =Calendar= In addition to religion, the Pyu also imported science and astronomical expertise from India. The Chinese records also report that the Pyu knew how to make astronomical calculations. The Pyu calendar was based on the Buddhist calendar. There were two eras in use. The first was the Sakra Era, which was adopted in the Pyu realm in 80 CE, just two years after the new era had come into use in India. A second calendar was adopted at Sri Ksetra in 638, superseding the Sakra Era. The calendar, the first day of which was 22 March 638, later became the Burmese calendar, and is still in use in present-day Myanmar. (The existence of two Pyu calendars has been cause for dispute among scholars trying interpret the dates on the finds.)Htin Aung 1967: 18‚Äì19 Architecture =Irrigation structures= The Pyu-era architectural practices greatly influenced later Pagan and Burmese architecture. The techniques of building dams, canals and weirs found in pre- colonial Upper Burma trace their origins to the Pyu era and the Pagan era. (Burmans likely introduced new water management methods, especially the canal building techniques which became the prevailing method of irrigation in the Pagan era.) =City planning= The Pyu city plans, consisted of square/rectangles and circles, were a mix of indigenous and Indian designs. It is believed that circular patterns inside the cities were Pyu while the rectangle or square shape of the outer walls and the use of 12 gates were Indian in origin. According to historian Cooler, \\"the adoption of Indian concepts of city planning incorporated a belief in the efficacy of the world axis that connects the centermost point in a properly constructed Mandala city with the city of the Gods above (Tavatimsa heaven) in order to assure prosperity throughout the kingdom below\\". Pyu-era city practices were the forefathers of the latter-day Burmese city and palace designs down to the 19th century Mandalay. =Temple design= Shwezigon Pagoda (built in the 11th century) at Pagan, based on earlier Pyu design From the 4th century onward, the Pyu built many Buddhist stupas and other religious buildings. The styles, ground plans, even the brick size and construction techniques of these buildings point to the Andhra region, particularly Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda in present-day southeastern India. Some evidence of Ceylonese contact is seen by the presence of Anuradhapura style \\"moonstones\\" discovered at Beikthano and Halin. By perhaps the 7th century, tall cylindrical stupas such as the Bawbawgyi, Payagyi and Payama had emerged at Sri Ksetra.Aung-Thwin 2005: pp. 30‚Äì31 The Pyu architecture greatly influenced later Burmese Buddhist temple designs. For example, temples at Sri Ksetra such as the Bebe and Lemyethna were prototypes for the later hollow (gu) temples of Pagan. The floor plan of the 13th century Somingyi Monastery at Pagan was largely identical to that of a 4th-century monastery at Beikthano. The solid stupas of Sri Ksetra were in turn prototypes for Pagan's such as the Shwezigon, Shwehsandaw, and Mingalazedi, and ultimately, the Shwedagon in modern Yangon. Demography The city-states were mainly populated by the Tibeto-Burman- speaking Pyu people, who like their cousins Burmans are believed to have migrated from the present Qinghai and Gansu provinces in north-central China, via Yunnan.Harvey 1925: 3Hall 1960: 11 Extensive external trade attracted sizeable communities of Indians and the Mon, especially in the south. In the north, trickles of Burmans may have entered the Pyu realm from Yunnan as early as the 7th century. (Modern scholarship however holds that Burmans did not arrive in large numbers until the mid-to-late 9th century, and perhaps as late as the 10th century, according to radiocarbon dating of Pagan's walls.) The size of population of the Pyu realm was probably a few hundred thousand, given that the 17th and 18th century Burma (about the size of present-day Myanmar) only had about 2 million people. Administration The Pyu settlements were ruled by independent chiefs. The chiefs at larger city-states later styled themselves as kings, and established courts largely modelled after the Indian (Hindu) concepts of monarchy. Not all Hindu concepts such as divine kingship were fully adopted due to the presence of Theravada Buddhism. It is not clear if a vassalage-overlord relationship existed between the larger city-states and smaller towns. The Burmese chronicles mention alliances between the states such as one between Beikthano and Sri Ksetra. By and large, each Pyu city- state appeared to have controlled just the city itself.Htin Aung 1967: 15‚Äì16 The large size of the Pyu cities (660 to 1400 hectares) vis-a-vis Pagan (only 140 hectares) suggests that much of the population resided within the walls, as corroborated by the Chinese records.Aung-Thwin 2005: 40 Archaeology in Pagan produced Pyu artefacts across a number of the settlements in the enclosed complex dating to the first millennium, until approximately 1100 C.E. when a shift to a monument-rich state and diffusion beyond walled boundaries is evident. Current status of the finds Aside from Sri Ksetra and Beikthano, the rest of the Pyu sites have not been extensively excavated. The care of the sites falls under the purview of the Ministry of Culture's Department of Archaeology. In November 2011, the Department reportedly was planning a museum at Sri Ksetra, and working with the UNESCO to gain recognition for Sri Ksetra, Beikthano and Halin as World Heritage sites and the three old cities were recognised as World Heritage sites in 2014.

It is used when the kidneys are not working well, which is called kidney failure and includes acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Renal replacement therapy includes dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), hemofiltration, and hemodiafiltration, which are various ways of filtration of blood with or without machines. Renal replacement therapy also includes kidney transplantation, which is the ultimate form of replacement in that the old kidney is replaced by a donor kidney. These treatments are not truly cures for kidney disease. In the context of chronic kidney disease, they are more accurately viewed as life- extending treatments, although if chronic kidney disease is managed well with dialysis and a compatible graft is found early and is successfully transplanted, the clinical course can be quite favorable, with life expectancy of many years. Likewise, in certain acute illnesses or trauma resulting in acute kidney injury, a person could very well survive for many years, with relatively good kidney function, before needing intervention again, as long as they had good response to dialysis, they got a kidney transplant fairly quickly if needed, their body did not reject the transplanted kidney, and they had no other significant health problems. Early dialysis (and, if indicated, early renal transplant) in acute kidney failure usually brings more favorable outcomes. Types Hemodialysis, hemofiltration, and hemodiafiltration can be continuous or intermittent and can use an arteriovenous route (in which blood leaves from an artery and returns via a vein) or a venovenous route (in which blood leaves from a vein and returns via a vein). This results in various types of RRT, as follows: * continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)  continuous hemodialysis (CHD) * continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) * continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD)  continuous hemofiltration (CHF) * continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH or CAVHF) * continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH or CVVHF)  continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) * continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration (CAVHDF) * continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) * intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT)  intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) * intermittent venovenous hemodialysis (IVVHD)  intermittent hemofiltration (IHF) * intermittent venovenous hemofiltration (IVVH or IVVHF)  intermittent hemodiafiltration (IHDF) * intermittent venovenous hemodiafiltration (IVVHDF)  Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)  Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a slow process that simulates the continuity of the kidney functions. It is generally implemented over 24 hours to several days to reduce the fluid overload and excess uremic toxins.

Amongst his most notable successes as a TV producer were Colditz, The Brothers, Secret Army and Howards' Way. After studying at RADA, Glaister made his West End debut in 1939. With the outbreak of war, he joined the Royal Air Force, initially flying a Blenheim bomber and later serving as a photo reconnaissance pilot in 208 Squadron RAF in the Western Desert initially flying Westland Lysanders. It was during these latter duties that he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for a hazardous reconnaissance flight in an unarmed Hurricane at extremely low level across the Italian front line. Glaister later drew on his RAF experiences when, in 1963, he produced Moonstrike, a drama about an RAF squadron which ferried agents in and out of occupied Europe in Westland Lysanders. From 1962, he worked on the popular Dr Finlay's Casebook. His 1968 production The Expert is based on the work of his uncle, forensic scientist Prof John Glaister FRSE.http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/medicine/aboutus/history/ourfamousscholars/theglaisters/ Glaister's success ended with the 1991 series Trainer, which was moved from prime time to a weeknight slot because of its perceived failure. However, it sold well overseas. Glaister was married three times and had three daughters, two from his final marriage, to Joan.

He is currently the artistic director of the Queensland Ballet in Brisbane, Australia.Queensland Ballet (2012). Li Cunxin returns to the stage as Queensland Ballet's new Artistic Director . Retrieved 1 October 2012. Life and career Li was the sixth of seven brothers, born into poverty in the Li Commune near the city of Qingdao in the Shandong province of the People's Republic of China. He often had to support his extremely poor family. Li's early life coincided with Mao Zedong's rule over the new Communist nation. Li had a strong desire to serve China's Communist Party. He was quite politically devout, eventually joining in the CCP's Youth League. At the age of eleven, he was chosen by Madame Mao's cultural advisors to attend the Beijing Dance Academy, where students had to undergo 16-hour-a-day training. He attended the Academy for seven years. The regime in Beijing Dance was harsh, starting each morning at 5:30. Li performed well in the politics class, but did badly in ballet. This changed when he met Teacher Xiao, who had a passion for ballet. Xiao's passion influenced Li, and by the end of the seven years' training he became a very good dancer.Mao's Last Dancer, Li Cunxin homepage Artistic Director of the Houston Ballet Ben Stevenson was teaching two semesters at the Beijing Dance Academy. He offered a full scholarship for two dancers to study at the Houston Ballet summer school and Li was chosen as one. (Li was one of the first students from the Beijing Dance Academy to go to the United States under financial support from the central government of the People's Republic of China.) After his study at the summer school, Li defected to the West. He was held in the Chinese Consulate in Houston, his defection creating headlines in America. He had begun a relationship with an aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey, and in 1981, they married so that Li could avoid deportation. After 21 hours of negotiations, and intervention by George Bush Sr. (U.S. Vice President at the time), Li was allowed to stay in the US as a free man, but his Chinese citizenship was revoked. Li subsequently danced with the Houston Ballet for sixteen years, during which he won two silver and a bronze medal at International Ballet Competitions. While dancing in London, he met ballerina Mary McKendry from Rockhampton, Australia. They married in 1987. In 1995 they moved to Melbourne, Australia, with their two children. Li became a principal dancer with The Australian Ballet. McKendry and Li have three children: Sophie (1989) Thomas (1992) and Bridie (1997).Mao's Last Dancer film tie-in by Li Cunxin. Penguin Books Australia. . In July 2012, Li was named as Artistic Director of the Queensland Ballet.Li Cunxin speaker profile, Saxton Speakers Bureau Li established himself as a mainstay of Brisbane's cultural scene.Brisbane Times, 31 July 2014 He was named Australian Father of the Year in 2009. In July 2016, Barbara Baehr and Robert Whyte from the Queensland Museum named a newly discovered spider species Maratus licunxini after Li Cunxin. Dr Baehr said a Queensland Ballet performance of Li Cunxin's A Midsummer Night's Dream reminded her of the stunning mating display of the peacock spider. Li said he was honoured to have the spider named after him saying \\"having seen this incredible spider, the intricate mating dance, the fancy peacock markings, I can understand why Barbara would make a link with our ballet dancers.\\" After 18 years off-stage, Cunxin returned for a one-off performance as Drosselmeyer, specially choreographed by Ben Stevenson,\\"The Nutcracker: Li brings his magic to a cracking chestnut\\" by Deborah Jones, The Australian, 12 December 2017. in The Nutcracker for the Queensland Ballet, dancing again with his wife, Mary McKendry, with whom he last danced in this work 26 years ago in Houston.\\"Mao's Last Dancer Li Cunxin makes ballet return in the Nutcracker after 18 years off stage\\" by Lesley Robinson, ABC News, 7 December 2017. In the 2019 Birthday Honours, Cunxin was appointed officer (AO) of the Order of Australia for \\"distinguished service to the performing arts, particularly to ballet, as a dancer and artistic director\\". =Career as a stockbroker= After arriving in Australia in 1995, when sidelined by a sprained ankle, Li occupied himself by gaining work experience with ANZ Securities and embarking on a three-year diploma course with the Australian Securities Institute. He had previously become interested in the stock market while in Houston. The Australian Ballet and ANZ Securities accommodated his desire to work at two professions simultaneously, dancing and stockbroking. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays he worked at the stockbroking firm from 7:30am till noon when he arrived at the Australian Ballet for rehearsals and to prepare for performances. He followed this routine for two years. He believed these were his best years as a dancer. \\"I got to a level I thought I would never reach, a fusion of technique and artistry. When I was younger I might have been better technically, but I was lacking artistic maturity.\\" Li retired from ballet in 1999 at the age of 38 and joined Bell Potter Securities to establish its Asian desk. Mao's Last Dancer In 2003 Li published his autobiography, Mao's Last Dancer. It has received numerous accolades, including the Australian Book of the Year award. In 2008, the children's version of this book, Mao's Last Dancer: The Peasant Prince (illustrated by Anne Spudvilas), won the Australian Publishers Association's Book of the Year for Younger Children and the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards Children's Book Award. Mao's Last Dancer was adapted into a 2009 feature film of the same name by director Bruce Beresford and writer Jan Sardi, starring Chi Cao, Bruce Greenwood and Kyle MacLachlan. At the S√£o Paulo International Film Festival 2009 the film won Best Foreign Feature Film Audience Award (tied with Broken Embraces).

Weiss is an American songwriter and vocalist. A fixture on the Los Angeles scene, Weiss is known for an eclectic mix of blues, beat poetry, and rock and roll. His music includes strains of every rhythmic style from nursery rhymes to zydeco. Early life Chuck E. Weiss grew up in Denver, Colorado, United States, where his parents owned a record store (The Record Center, 434 16th Street). Through his parents, and by spending time at the local blues bar Ebbetts Field, he met Lightnin' Hopkins. Hopkins was impressed with his drum playing and took him on tour, where Weiss had the opportunity to play with Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Roger Miller, Dr. John, and others. Weiss was a disc jockey on alternative rock station KFML-FM-Denver in the early 1970s. Music Weiss's first album, The Other Side of Town, was released in 1981. Weiss was featured on the 1990 album L.A. Ya Ya, a compilation of performances by Los Angeles-based blues artists. In 1995, Weiss played on P's self-titled album. The band featured Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers and actor Johnny Depp. Weiss released his first full-length album, Extremely Cool, in 1999, featuring extensive collaboration with Tony Gilkyson and Tom Waits, who co- produced the album for his longtime acquaintance. (They met in the early 70s at a nightclub in Denver called Ebbetts Field, where Weiss played in the house band.) Tom Waits appears on at least two tracks. The style is heavily reminiscent of Waits, both in composition and vocal approach. Either could have influenced the other. The opening track Devil With Blue Suede Shoes was produced by Johnny Depp and features Toby Dammit on drums. It was used in Depp's film The Brave. Willie Dixon is quoted on the original packaging of Extremely Cool as saying, \\"Ain't ya got ears son? That little Jew boy with the big old head be one of the best musicians in this town, this country even.\\" Weiss was the subject of Rickie Lee Jones's hit song \\"Chuck E.'s In Love\\", from her 1979 debut album. At the time Jones was linked romantically to Tom Waits. All three lived in the Tropicana Hotel in Los Angeles, in the middle of a fertile musical scene including Levi and the Rockats, Stray Cats, Black Flag, Frank Zappa and others. Weiss is referred to in the song title \\"Jitterbug Boy (Sharing a Curbstone with Chuck E. Weiss, Robert Marchese, Paul Body and The Mug and Artie)\\" and other lyrics from the Tom Waits album Small Change, as well as passing references on Nighthawks at the Diner. His next album after Extremely Cool, Old Souls and Wolf Tickets, was released in 2001. It was also produced by Gilkyson and is perhaps less reminiscent of Tom Waits and more redolent of Delta blues acts decades older. \\"Down the Road a Piece,\\" from Old Souls & Wolf Tickets, is a 1970 recording of the Weiss and Willie Dixon playing together. In 2006, Weiss released the album 23rd & Stout, an album more reminiscent of Waits's 1980s output, featuring an exploration of many blues and rumba styles, as well as a tribute to Sterling Holloway, entitled \\"Sho' Is Cold\\". Also featured is long time friend and collaborator Diablo Dimes. In 2013, Weiss wrote and recorded \\"Anthem for Old Souls\\" for the Sea shanty-compilation Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs & Chanteys (2013). In 2014, Weiss released Red Beans and Weiss. This is the first album released with Anti-. Weiss has been associated with Los Angeles and Southern California for years, saying he does not like to travel by airplane. Weiss played 11 years of Mondays at a club called The Central before it fell on hard times. Weiss and his friend Johnny Depp (who was executive producer on the first track on Extremely Cool) were instrumental in resuscitating it as the Viper Room, which later became notorious when River Phoenix died there in 1993. Extremely Cool makes reference to Canter's Kibitz Room, a small nightclub in a larger diner in Los Angeles's Fairfax District, where Weiss has also played habitually. His regular band is called The Goddamn Liars. Television In the May 14, 2002 episode of Gilmore Girls entitled \\"Lorelai's Graduation Day\\", Weiss appeared as the proprietor of a record store in New York City in which Rory and Jess browse. He made brief cameos on two 1990 Married... with Children episodes as a homeless man and one on an episode of Brotherly Love as Leo the garbage man. He also made an appearance on My Wife and Kids.

Normally sold individually wrapped, alone or in boxes of 6 or more, they are a popular grab-and-go breakfast, eaten cold or heated in a microwave oven. Culture The honey bun has become an iconic food in the United States. Honey buns are also used as currency in United States prisons, where they are sold from prison commissaries. In the state of Florida, 270,000 are sold per month as of 2010. In a highly publicized instance, honey buns were used by guards in Miami to pay for the beating of a teenager in a youth detention center, resulting in the teen's death.

Before the dough is placed in the baking-pan, the latter is lined with the \\"sticky\\" ingredients, such as brown sugar, honey (or both), as well as nuts and raisins and perhaps more sugar and sometimes butter. After the buns are baked, they are inverted so that the pan lining then becomes a topping. Commercially produced sticky buns, however, are usually just baked in an aluminum loaf tin, which allows the topping to suffuse the buns, making them sticky throughout. The way the buns were baked allows them to more or less be pulled off as individual servings, although it is often a futile effort. Sticky buns have been consumed since the Middle Ages, at which time cinnamon became more prominent. Sticky buns also have a Germanic origin and were originally known as \\"Schnecken\\". The Pennsylvania Dutch introduced Schnecken in the United States. Wherever 18th-century German settlers (such as the Pennsylvania Dutch) went, sticky buns have remained long after many other cultural traits have disappeared. In Venezuela, there is a very similar local version of them called golfeado. The main difference between them is the ground fresh cheese on top that gives the bun a very particular sweet-salty taste.

Originally written for a regular broadcast on CFRB radio in Toronto on June 5, 1973, it became a media and public phenomenon. It was replayed several times a day by some United States radio stations and released as a hit audio recording in several forms. Ronald Reagan credited it for giving comfort to the United States in difficult times, and it was widely rediscovered and re-disseminated as the United States faced new crises in the 2000s. On June 5, Sinclair discussed some stories from the day's news. Widespread heavy tornado damage afflicted the U.S. Midwest. The Mississippi River was in flood stage. The American Red Cross faced an imminent threat of insolvency. And the United States dollar reached very low levels, something Sinclair, an inveterate market watcher, was keenly aware of. \\"The Americans\\" was not, as widely reported later, an angry response to countries that were criticizing the American failure in the Vietnam War. Instead, Sinclair's commentary stated that when many countries faced economic crises or natural disasters, Americans were among the most generous people in the world at offering assistance, but when America faced a crisis, it often faced that crisis alone. Recordings =Byron MacGregor / CKLW Radio= The editorial became a phenomenon on American radio after CKLW Radio news director and news anchor Byron MacGregor read Sinclair's commentary on the air. After CKLW (a 50,000 watt Windsor/Detroit powerhouse radio station) received many requests for it, a record was released by Westbound Records of MacGregor's recording, with \\"America the Beautiful\\" being played by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. By January 1974, The Americans record became one of the fastest-selling records in United States, reaching sales of 2 million within a month of its release. The single eventually sold three and a half million copies in the United States, and hit #1 in Cash Box, as well as #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. All proceeds from the record were donated by MacGregor himself to the American Red Cross. (This version reached #42 in Canada.) =Gordon Sinclair= Gordon Sinclair's original recording was released as a record as well, with \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" in the background, and went to #24 on the US record charts. This made the 73-year-old Sinclair the second-oldest living person ever to have a Billboard US Top 40 hit (75-year-old Moms Mabley had a Top 40 hit in 1969 with \\"Abraham, Martin & John\\"). The recording hit #30 in the Canadian RPM Magazine charts. In May 1974, Sinclair told The Globe and Mail that he was \\"sick of hearing\\" the recording and embarrassed by some of the inaccuracies it contained,\\"3 golden minutes,\\" Martin O'Malley, The Globe and Mail, May 23, 1974, pp. 1-2. but that he would still write the same editorial over again. =Tex Ritter= Country singer Tex Ritter also released a version of the track, which was issued just weeks after his death in January 1974. Ritter's version of \\"The Americans (A Canadian's Opinion)\\" made it to #90 nationally in the US, and #35 on the country charts. It was the last chart hit of Ritter's career. =Legacy= In 1981, when Ronald Reagan made his first state visit to Canada, he praised both Sinclair and MacGregor as figures who had given the United States an inspiring tribute in one of its darkest hours. MacGregor was also posthumously honored with the National Americanism Award. Comedian Albert Brooks spoofed \\"Americans\\" with his recorded routine \\"A Phone Call To Americans\\" \\"The Americans\\" performed by Byron MacGregor was widely revived on the Internet, on radio & television and in newspapers in 2001, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and again in 2005 in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Some revivals of the message incorrectly stated that it was newly written as a direct response to the recent crises; in this question of its authorship alone, the address has become a part of urban legend.

Located within an 88 hectare campus in Jurong West, it was officially opened by the then-prime minister Goh Chok Tong on 25 August 1995. Officers from the Singapore Army, Republic of Singapore Navy and Republic of Singapore Air Force begin their training at the Officer Cadet School (OCS), before proceeding on to the SAF Advanced Schools and the Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College (GKSCSC) at various stages of their careers. History Although the SAFTI MI is an amalgamated institution, it draws much of its heritage from the original Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute (SAFTI), which was officially opened on 14 February 1966 at Pasir Laba Camp. The link to the past is preserved in both the name of the new institute, as well as the name of the bridge connecting Pasir Laba Camp with the new SAFTI MI. Officially named SAFTI Link, it is referred to by insiders as Link Bridge. Architecture There is much symbolism in the SAFTI MI campus. The Officer Cadet School HQ is described by the architect as being shaped like a cradle, from which officers are born (paraphrased). SAFTI MI sits on a hill. The locations of each school are metaphors for the career of an SAF officer. The lower reaches house the barracks for Officer Cadets. Advancing up the hill, SAF Advanced Schools are encountered. Finally, at the pinnacle, is the Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College. A prominent feature is the Tower, approximately 60 m tall and visible from many parts of western Singapore. It is a three-sided tower, for the tri- service nature of the SAF. It is served by a lift and a 265 step stairway which symbolises the days a cadet requires to take towards commissioning day. This number should not be taken literally as the various commissioning courses vary in length. The OCS parade square is 120 m by 170 m in area. It is designed to reduce the heat and glare of the sun. The viewing stands are able to accommodate up to 5000 people. SAFTI MI was originally intended to be an \\"open camp\\" like the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy. Prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks, civilians did not need passes or security checks before entering the complex. The only restricted areas were the offices and living quarters. Since 9/11 attacks, however, the installation has been subject to access restrictions as with other military bases, and security checks are mandatory for all visitors. No unauthorised photography and filming is also allowed at this area, whereas offices and living quarters are gazetted as Red Zones, which means no camera phones are allowed at this point. Organisation The Commandant, a Brigadier General or Rear Admiral, heads SAFTI MI HQ. MI HQ oversees all training and training support within the complex.http://app.sgdi.gov.sg/listing.asp?agency_subtype=dept&agency;_id=0000000366 Schools There are a total of five schools in SAFTI MI: the Officer Cadet School (OCS) for cadets, SAF Advanced Schools (SAS) ‚Äì one for each Service ‚Äì for Captains, and the Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College (GKSCSC) for Majors and Lieutenant-Colonels. To meet the demands of the global environment, curriculum and various exercises of the schools go through major revamps about once every five years. The first revamp was in 1999, led by then-Permanent Secretary Peter Ho, and the most recent was led by BG Tan and his team in 2004. In between the five years, there were smaller reviews to maintain currency. For example, after mission like Operation Flying Eagle, some of the course content in SCSC and other schools was tweaked. New doctrine is also infused into the curriculum by SAFTI MI after various exercises carried out by the SAF. Leadership development is the means by which SAFTI MI tries to inculcate values, and better align the value in officers. > People don't come in with zero values, all of us have values from our > parents, our upbringing, from the schools that we have attended. With this > set of values, it is now a question of reaffirming some of them and > realigning some of them to the SAF's core values which have been in place > since the late 1980s, said BG Tan. SAFTI MI has a branch called the Centre of Leadership Development (CLD). This is a full-time SAF centre with psychologist and headed by a former brigade commander. These people focus their entire attention on how to develop officers in leadership. As for helping officers in handling uncertainty, a lot of different methodologies are incorporated in courses. =Officer Cadet School= Officer Cadet School (OCS) is the only commissioning route in the Singapore Armed Forces. Outstanding conscripts from Basic Military Training and the Specialist Cadet School (Specialists are NCO-equivalents in the SAF) are sent to OCS to train to be officers. On completion of their National Service, these officers will continue to serve with their men in the Operationally-Ready NSmen battalions. After commissioning, some officers may choose to continue to serve as career soldiers. Regular Specialists may also attend OCS on application, recommendation, and selection. Prior to moving to the SAFTI MI complex, OCS was at the old SAFTI at Pasir Laba Camp. =Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College= Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College conducts the Command and Staff Course (CSC) for career officers, and the National Service Command and Staff Course (NSCSC) for selected reservist officers who have demonstrated potential for higher command and staff appointments in the SAF. Before moving to SAFTI MI in 1995, SCSC was located at Fort Canning, Marina Hill, and Seletar Camp. SAFTI Services Centre SAFTI Services Centre, previously known as Service Support Unit (SSU),http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/saftimi/units/ssc/aboutus/History.html provides support services like security, medical, dental, physiotherapy, transport, estate, signal and logistics for all units within the camp complex. Facilities =Sport facilities= SAFTI MI has extensive sporting and recreation facilities including a stadium with a soccer field and running track, an Olympic-sized swimming pool with a diving tower, and an indoor rock- climbing wall. =Library= SAFTI MI Library houses one of the biggest collection on military history in Singapore. However, membership is only available to military personnel as of September 2019. The SAFTI MI Library has recently shifted its focus to being an autonomous library, with a heavy emphasis placed on electronic resources, and reliance on the patrons taking the initiative to maintain tidiness in the library. =Mess= As is the case for almost all camp complexes in the SAF, all the tenant units share a single Officers' Mess and a Warrant Officers' and Specialists' Mess. The Officers' Mess is located near the officers' living quarters, beside the artificial lake adjacent to the Singapore Discovery Centre. The Warrant Officers' and Specialists' Mess is similarly located near their accommodation blocks. The Officer Cadets have a mess too. However, they have much less liberty to use the facilities compared with the other personnel not under training. =SAFTI Link Bridge= The SAFTI Link Bridge (Chinese: --, Pinyin: --; ) is the first cable-stayed bridge in Singapore, spanning 100 metres across the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) linking the SAFTI Military Institute to Pasir Laba Camp training ground. It is a complete shortcut from NTU all the way to Joo Koon; similar to the Lorong Danau road which connects the National Shooting Centre and NTU. References *Menon, R.

It is a member of the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae. It was first described in 1780 by Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann. The black wildebeest is typically in head-and-body length, and the typical weight is . Males stand about at the shoulder, while the height of the females is . The black wildebeest is characterised by its white, long, horse-like tail. It also has a dark brown to black coat and long, dark- coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. The black wildebeest is an herbivore, and almost the whole diet consists of grasses. Water is an essential requirement. The three distinct social groups are the female herds, the bachelor herds, and the territorial bulls. They are fast runners and communicate using a variety of visual and vocal communications. The primary breeding season for the black wildebeest is from February to April. A single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about 8 and a half months. The calf remains with its mother until her next calf is born a year later. The black wildebeest inhabits open plains, grasslands, and Karoo shrublands. The natural populations of black wildebeest, endemic in the southern part of Africa, were almost completely exterminated in the 19th century, due to their reputation as pests and the value of their hides and meat. However, the species has been reintroduced widely from captive specimens, both in private areas and nature reserves throughout most of Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa. The species has also been introduced outside its natural range in Namibia and Kenya. Taxonomy and evolution The scientific name of the black wildebeest is Connochaetes gnou. The animal is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family Bovida] and was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780. He based his description on an article written by natural philosopher Jean-Nicolas- S√©bastien Allamand in 1776. The generic name Connochaetes derives from the Greek words Œ∫œåŒΩŒΩŒøœÇ, k√≥nnos, \\"beard\\", and œáŒ±ŒØœÑŒ∑, kha√≠tƒì, \\"flowing hair\\", \\"mane\\". The specific name gnou originates from the Khoikhoi name for these animals, gnou. The common name \\"gnu\\" is also said to have originated from the Hottentot name t'gnu, which refers to the repeated calls of \\"ge-nu\\" by the bull in the mating season. The black wildebeest was first discovered in the northern part of South Africa in the 1800s. The black wildebeest is currently included in the same genus as the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). This has not always been the case, and at one time the latter was placed under a separate genus of its own, Gorgon. The black wildebeest lineage seems to have diverged from the blue wildebeest in the mid- to late Pleistocene, and became a distinct species around a million years ago. This evolution is quite recent on a geologic time scale. Features necessary for defending a territory, such as the horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, have been found in their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about 800,000 years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though whether or not they are as ancient as those found in Cornelia is unclear. Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and it has been suggested that these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo. =Hybrids= The black wildebeest is known to hybridise with its taxonomically close relative, the blue wildebeest. Male black wildebeest have been reported to mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, but hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns, and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase in the size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the auditory bullae are highly deformed, and in others, the radius and ulna are fused. Description The black wildebeest has horns that curve forward. Black wildebeest are sexually dimorphic, with females being smaller in size and more slender than males. The head-and-body length is typically between . Males reach about at the shoulder, while females reach . Males typically weigh and females . A distinguishing feature in both sexes is the tail, which is long and similar to that of a horse. Its bright- white colour gives this animal the vernacular name of \\"white-tailed gnu\\", and also distinguishes it from the blue wildebeest, which has a black tail. The length of the tail ranges from . The black wildebeest has a dark brown or black coat, which is slightly paler in summer and coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up from the back of the neck. The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes. Both sexes have strong horns that curve forward, resembling hooks, which are up to long. The horns have a broad base in mature males, and are flattened to form a protective shield. In females, the horns are both shorter and narrower. They become fully developed in females in the third year, while horns are fully grown in males at age of four or five. The black wildebeest normally has 13 thoracic vertebrae, though specimens with 14 have been reported, and this species shows a tendency for the thoracic region to become elongated. The scent glands secrete a glutinous substance in front of the eyes, under the hair tufts, and on the forefeet. Females have two teats. Apart from the difference in the appearance of the tail, the two species of wildebeest also differ in size and colour, with the black being smaller and darker than the blue. The black wildebeest can maintain its body temperature within a small range in spite of large fluctuations in external temperatures. It shows well-developed orientation behaviour towards solar radiation, which helps it thrive in hot, and often shadeless, habitats. The erythrocyte count is high at birth and increases till the age of 2-3 months, while in contrast, the leucocyte count is low at birth and falls throughout the animal's life. The neutrophil count is high at all ages. The haematocrit and haemoglobin content decreases till 20-30 days after birth. A peak in the content of all these haemological parameters occurs at the age of 2-3 months, after which the readings gradually decline, reaching their lowest values in the oldest individuals. The presence of fast-twitch fibres and the ability of the muscles to use large amounts of oxygen help explain the rapid running speed of the black wildebeest and its high resistance to fatigue. Individuals may live for about 20 years. Diseases and parasites The black wildebeest is particularly susceptible to anthrax, and rare and widely scattered outbreaks have been recorded and have proved deadly. Ataxia related to myelopathy and low copper concentrations in the liver have also been seen in the black wildebeest. Heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium) is a tick-borne rickettsial disease that affects the black wildebeest, and as the blue wildebeest is fatally affected by rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, it is also likely to be susceptible to these. Malignant catarrhal fever is a fatal disease of domestic cattle caused by a gammaherpesvirus. Like the blue wildebeest, the black wildebeest seems to act as a reservoir for the virus and all animals are carriers, being persistently infected, but showing no symptoms. The virus is transmitted from mother to calf during the gestation period or soon after birth. Black wildebeest act as hosts to a number of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia h√§ssleri. The first instar larvae of G. h√§ssleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals. Ecology and behavior Black wildebeest can run at speeds up to Lions feeding off a carcass of a black wildebeest at Krugersdorp Game Park in Gauteng, South Africa Black wildebeest are mainly active during the early morning and late afternoon, preferring to rest during the hottest part of the day. The animals can run at speeds of . When a person approaches a herd to within a few hundred metres, the wildebeest snort and run a short distance before stopping and looking back, repeating this behaviour if further approached. They communicate with each other using pheromones detected by flehmen and several forms of vocal communication. One of these is a metallic snort or an echoing \\"hick\\", that can be heard up to 1.5 km (1 mi) away. They are preyed on by the lion, spotted hyena, Cape hunting dog, leopard, cheetah, and crocodile. Of these, the calves are targeted mainly by the hyenas, while lions attack the adults. The black wildebeest is a gregarious animal with a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups, the female herds consisting of adult females and their young, the bachelor herds consisting only of yearlings and older males, and territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is highest in the densest populations and also increases with forage density. A strong attachment exists among members of the female herd, many of which are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations, and unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression on the part of the males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males. Mature bulls, generally more than 4 years old, set up their own territories through which female herds often pass. These territories are maintained throughout the year, with animals usually separated by a distance around , but this can vary according to the quality of the habitat. In favourable conditions, this distance is as little as , but can be as large as in poor habitat. Each bull has a patch of ground in the centre of his territory in which he regularly drops dung, and in which he performs acts of display. These include urinating, scraping, pawing, and rolling on the ground and thumping it with his horns - all of which demonstrate his prowess to other bulls. An encounter between two bulls involves elaborate rituals. Estes coined the term \\"challenge ritual\\" to describe this behaviour for the blue wildebeest, but this is also applicable to the black wildebeest, owing to their close similarity in behavior. The bulls approach each other with their heads lowered, resembling a grazing position (sometimes actually grazing). This is usually followed by movements such as standing in a reverse-parallel position, in which one male urinates and the opponent smells and performs flehmen, after which they may reverse the procedure. During this ritual or afterwards, the two can toss their horns at each other, circle one another, or even look away. Then begins the fight, which may be of low intensity (consisting of interlocking the horns and pushing each other in a standing position) or high intensity (consisting of their dropping to their knees and straining against each other powerfully, trying to remain in contact while their foreheads are nearly touching the ground). Threat displays such as shaking the head may also take place. =Diet= The black wildebeest is primarily a grazer Black wildebeest are predominantly grazers, preferring short grasses, but also feeding on other herbs and shrubs, especially when grass is scarce. Shrubs can comprise as much as 37% of the diet, but grasses normally form more than 90%. Water is essential, though they can exist without drinking water every day. The herds graze either in line or in loose groups, usually walking in single file when moving about. They are often accompanied by cattle egrets, which pick out and consume the insects hidden in their coats or disturbed by their movements. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, wildebeest roamed widely, probably in relation to the arrival of the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest, but at one time, they crossed the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Now, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms, and the extent of their movements is limited. In a study of the feeding activities of a number of female black wildebeest living in a shadeless habitat, they fed mostly at night. They were observed at regular intervals over a period of one year, and with an increase in temperature, the number of wildebeest feeding at night also increased. During cool weather, they lay down to rest, but in hotter conditions they rested while standing up. =Reproduction= Male black wildebeest reach sexual maturity at the age of three years, but may mature at a younger age in captivity. Females first come into estrus and breed as yearlings or as 2-year- olds. They breed only once in a year. A dominant male black wildebeest has a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs at the end of the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into estrus, the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination, and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males. A female with a suckling calf at Krugersdorp Game Park in Gauteng, South Africa The gestational period lasts for about 8.5 months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and repeatedly lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards, which causes the umbilical cord to break, and vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of 2-3 weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid- November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported. The calf has a tawny, shaggy coat and weighs about . By the end of the fourth week, the four incisors have fully emerged and about the same time, two knob-like structures, the horn buds, appear on the head. These later develop into horns, which reach a length of by the fifth month and are well developed by the eighth month. The calf is able to stand and run shortly after birth, a period of great danger for animals in the wild. It is fed by its lactating mother for 6-8 months, begins nibbling on grass blades at 4 weeks, and remains with the mother until her next calf is born a year later. Distribution and habitat The black wildebeest is native to southern Africa. Its historical range included South Africa, Swaziland, and Lesotho, but in the latter two countries, it was hunted to extinction in the 19th century. It has now been reintroduced to them and also introduced to Namibia, where it has become well established. The black wildebeest inhabits open plains, grasslands, and Karoo shrublands in both steep mountainous regions and lower undulating hills. The altitudes in these areas vary from . The herds are often migratory or nomadic, otherwise they may have regular home ranges of . Female herds roam in home ranges around in size. In the past, black wildebeest occurred in the highveld temperate grasslands during the dry winter season and the arid Karoo region during the rains. However, as a result of massive hunting of the animal for its hide, they vanished from their historical range, and are now largely limited to game farms and protected reserves in Southern Africa. In most reserves, the black wildebeest shares its habitat with the blesbok and the springbok. Threats and conservation Where it lives alongside the blue wildebeest, the two species can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the maintenance of the species. The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in Southern Africa in vast herds, but by the end of the 19th century, it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained. A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos, and from these, the population was rescued. More than 18,000 individuals are now believed to remain, 7,000 of which are in Namibia, outside their natural range, and where they are farmed. Around 80% of the wildebeest occurs in private areas, while the other 20% is confined in protected areas. The population is now trending upward (particularly on private land) and for this reason the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in its Red List of Threatened Species, rates the black wildebeest as being of \\"Least Concern\\". Its introduction into Namibia has been a success and numbers have increased substantially there from 150 in 1982 to 7,000 in 1992. Uses and interaction with humans A bag made with wildebeest skin The black wildebeest is depicted on the coat of arms of the Province of Natal in South Africa. Over the years, the South African authorities have issued stamps displaying the animal and the South African Mint has struck a 5-rand coin with a prancing black wildebeest. Though they are not present in their natural habitat in such large numbers today, black wildebeest were at one time the main herbivores in the ecosystem and the main prey item for large predators such as the lion. Now, they are economically important for human beings, as they are a major tourist attraction, as well as providing animal products such as leather and meat. The hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard. Wildebeest meat is dried to make biltong, an important part of South African cuisine. The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is at its best during the autumn season. The wildebeest can provide 10 times as much meat as Thomson's gazelle. The silky, flowing tail is used to make fly-whisks or chowries. However, black wildebeest can also affect human beings negatively. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock and can transmit fatal diseases such as rinderpest, and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies, and paramphistome flukes.

The town of Chetwynd, British Columbia was named in his honor. Born in Staffordshire, England, he was the younger brother of Sir (Arthur Henry) Talbot Chetwynd, 7th Baronet. He came to Canada at the age of eighteen, and was soon in Ashcroft, British Columbia (west of Kamloops Lake). He received employment from Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey (nephew of Lady Florence Cecilia Paget, who was married to Chetwynd's first cousin once removed Sir George, 4th Baronet) to manage Anglesey's fruit farm holdings at Walhachin. On October 8, 1912, he married Frances Mary Jupe, daughter of James Jupe of Mere, Wiltshire. He fought in World War I as a member of the Royal Field Artillery, attaining the rank of lieutenant therein. He received the Military Cross in 1918 for his service. After returning from Europe, he entered cattle ranching and the transportation business needed to get the cattle and other agriculture products to eastern markets. As a fruit grower and rancher, he saw both the potential for the Cariboo and Peace River Country, but also the need for efficient rail transportation to serve the region. In 1942 he became the public relations officer for Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE; later BC Rail; now part of the CN Rail system), a post he held until 1952; he also served as a director of the PGE. He was a big advocate for building a railroad to central British Columbia. Running as a member from the District of Cariboo, he was elected to provincial legislature in 1952. He served on the Executive Council of British Columbia as Minister of Trade and Industry, Railways and Fisheries from 1952 to 1956, and also as Minister of Agriculture. At the age of 66, ill health forced him to retire from politics. Full of confidence, he once bet executives at PGE, and politicians (a new Stetson hat), that the new extension line for Peace River would leave North Vancouver on June 11, 1956 at 4:15 pm. He had many takers, totaling more than $800 in hats. He won the bet, and got his picture in the newspaper wearing a stack of hats. Chetwynd died at Victoria, British Columbia on April 3, 1957. Rail service arrived in Little Prairie in April 1958. It would bring an economic transformation to the area, which until then had to rely on trucks to get any goods, such as timber, out of the valley. The Premier of British Columbia, W.A.C. Bennett, renamed the PGE station at Little Prairie to Chetwynd, in his honor, and the town of Little Prairie soon changed its name in 1959.

Over the years, a core group of users has developed, and this has led to many of the reviews incorporating inside jokes. Perhaps the most famous is the ‚ÄúIcy Dead People‚Äù review for the film Titanic. This review, referring to those who froze to death in the Atlantic following the sinking of the RMS Titanic, is an example of a ‚Äúpop culture reference‚Äù review, as it is a pun on a famous quote from another film (The Sixth Sense). It quickly became one of the top vote-getters, and has spawned imitators throughout the site, all based on the same film quote. Reviews are also judged by how completely they summarize the film. Each FWFRer is allowed to vote on a given review only once. The twenty reviews that receive the most votes each day are displayed in the \\"Top Reviews\\" section of the site. The Top Reviews section changes frequently to reflect votes cast during the preceding 24 hours. =All-time top reviews= The site's \\"All-time Top Reviews\\" pages display the five hundred reviews with the most votes. Currently, long-time reviewer MguyX's review of Kramer vs. Kramer is the all-time highest vote getter (\\"I bet Kramer wins.\\"), which only barely displaced the relatively less prolific pudking's review for Titanic (\\"Icy dead people.\\") at the number one spot. Other former number ones include Aardball's review of The Blair Witch Project (\\"Tense. Intense. In tents.\\") and noncentz's review of Breast Men (\\"Sale of two titties.\\").All Time Top Reviews Accolades FWFRers may collate movies with a common feature into groups, referred to on the site as \\"accolades\\". They are called \\"accolades\\" because a trophy, assigned to the accolade by its creator, is awarded to the reviewer once a review is written for every movie in the group. Any number of accolades may be created, and no guidelines have been set for their creation. However, accolades are expected to have some kind of purpose or theme, an accolade may contain, for example; all the films in a series or a franchise (the Star Wars films, The Terminator series, et al.), all the films featuring a certain actor or made by a particular director, films featuring a day of the week in the title, or films with a post-Apocalyptic theme etc.Clews, Benj. \\"What is an accolade?\\" The Four Word Film Review. 9 December 2003.

Four Word Film Reviews: The Book After several years of expressed interest from founder Benj Clews to develop the website's content into book form, in 2008 site user Michael Onesi spearheaded a concerted pitch effort to assess publishers' interest. Within two weeks, interest was registered from several publishing agents, and ultimately Adams Media won the right to publish the book. Made up of reviews originally published on the website, the book was released on August 18, 2010. In mid-2010, a second website was established to promote the book.www.fourwordbook.com The Fourum FWFR has a message board, called the Fourum, for discussion of any topic.

It is downstream from the west end of Kamloops Lake, at the confluence of the Bonaparte and Thompson Rivers, and is in the Thompson-Nicola Regional District. Ashcroft's downtown is on the east side of the Thompson River, although the municipal boundaries straddle the river, with housing and the town's hospital and recreation complex on the west bank. It is something of a \\"twin\\" to nearby Cache Creek, which unlike Ashcroft is on the major highway. History Ashcroft was named after the nearby Ashcroft Manor on Ashcroft Ranch founded in the 1860s, during the Cariboo Gold Rush, by two English brothers named Clement Francis Cornwall and Henry Pennant Cornwall, who emigrated to Canada from Ashcroft, at Newington Bagpath in Gloucestershire. The brothers had originally come in search of gold; however, on hearing stories from failed gold searchers they decided to found the town to give future gold searchers a place to saddle their horses. They sold flour to packers and miners, helping to make the community. The Cariboo Road ran nearby but on the west bank of the Thompson River. Ashcroft was a major stop for trains, where mining supplies were dropped off. The Canadian Pacific Railway reached Ashcroft in 1884 and the town became a division point and service centre for the rail line. The province built a bridge across the river in 1890 so travellers could ride the train to Ashcroft then board a stagecoach for a journey north. In 1920, when the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (now BC Rail) was partially built, running from Squamish to Clinton and Williams Lake, Ashcroft lost strategic importance as a supply centre and transit point for the north. After this, the townsfolk started to rely on farming to sustain the community. Despite being dry, farming was very successful because of water from the Thompson River and hot sun. During the 1920s the small but successful Chinese community made money by testing the growing of potatoes and tomatoes. A tomato cannery was built in the village, which later closed in 1957. In 2001, Ashcroft expanded its boundaries to include the Ashcroft Ranch, which had been bought in 2000 by the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) with the intent of using it as the site of a landfill to succeed the Cache Creek sanitary landfill. In 2011, however, the British Columbia government denied an environmental assessment certificate for the landfill, and Metro Vancouver expressed a desire to divest itself of the property. Geography The geography in and around Ashcroft resembles that of desert terrain, due to the near desert conditions in lower elevation areas and has been marketed as sets for the film industry. A number of old west films and movies depicting the middle east have used this area as a stand in. =Climate= Ashcroft has a dry, and generally mild semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk). Transportation and communication Ashcroft town is not on the Fraser Canyon Highway, rather it sits on the east bank of the river below the bench. The highway runs from Spences Bridge to Cache Creek, and there is a turnoff at the Ashcroft Ranch for a separate road that goes into town. As a flag stop Via Rail's The Canadian calls at the Ashcroft railway station three times per week in each direction. Ashcroft is served by a community television station (run by the Ash-Creek Television Society), CH4472 on VHF channel 4 (with an effective radiated power of 74 watts at 15 meters above ground level), with a repeater (CH4473 on VHF 8, with an effective radiated power of 49 watts at 45 meters) in the neighbouring town of Cache Creek. Attractions Ashcroft was home to the Nl'akapxm Eagle Motorplex, a ¬º-mile IHRA-sanctioned dragstrip, which opened in 1987 and closed in April 2016. Ashcroft had its first annual Wellness Festival in July 2013. Sister city The Japanese town of Bifuka, in Hokkaido, was twinned with Ashcroft in 1994.

Since 2004, the term Darjeeling tea has been a registered geographical indication referring to products produced on certain estates within Darjeeling and Kalimpong. The tea leaves are processed as black tea, though some estates have expanded their product offerings to include leaves suitable for making green, white and oolong teas. The tea leaves are harvested by plucking the plant's top two leaves and the bud, from March to November, a timespan that is divided into four flushes. The first flush consists of the first few leaves grown after the plant's winter dormancy and produce a light floral tea with a slight astringency; this flush is also suitable for producing a white tea. Second flush leaves are harvested after the plant has been attacked by a leafhopper and the camellia tortrix so that the leaves create a tea with a distinctive muscatel aroma. The warm and wet weather of monsoon flush rapidly produces leaves but they are less flavourful and often used for blending. The autumn flush produces teas similar, but more muted, to the second flush. Camellia sinensis was first planted in the Darjeeling region in the mid-1800s. At the time, the British were seeking an alternative supply of tea apart China and attempted growing the plant in several candidate areas in India. Both the newly discovered assamica variety and the sinensis variety were planted but the sloped drainage, cool winters and cloud cover favoured sinensis. The British established numerous tea plantations, with the majority of workers being Gorkhas and Lepchas from Nepal and Sikkim. After independence, the estates were all subsequently sold to businesses in India and regulated under the laws of India. The Soviet Union replaced the British as the primary consumers of tea from Darjeeling. As Darjeeling tea gained a reputation for its distinctiveness and quality, it was marketed more to Western Europe with many estates acquiring organic, biodynamic and Fairtrade certifications and the Tea Board of India pursuing authentication and international promotion of Darjeeling teas.  History  Camellia sinensis was first planted in the Darjeeling area in 1841 by Archibald Campbell who was working for the East India Company in this jungle-covered, sparsely-populated area to develop a hill station for use by the British stationed in Kolkata. At the time, the British were seeking a source of tea outside of China and had both recently discovered a second variety of the plant growing in the wilderness of Assam and smuggled seeds and plantings out of China. The Chinese variety (sinensis) was planted in Saharanpur Botanical Gardens and propagated in other Himalayan gardens where Campbell had acquired seeds from Kumaun via Nathaniel Wallich. While the original plantings succeeded, Campbell moved to Lebong where he and several other residents planted a new batch, in 1846, of both varieties (sinensis and assamica). A year after planting the first three Company experimental tea gardens in 1852, at Tukvar, Steinthal and Alubari, they reported having 2,000 tea plants and Robert Fortune was sent to provide an expert opinion on the \\"suitableness of the climate and soil of the Hills for the cultivation and manufacture of Tea\\". While both varieties grew, the sinensis variety was flourishing, as it was found assamica preferred warmer and wetter growing conditions while sinensis had been selectively cultivated for higher elevations. The first commercial tea gardens were established in 1856 and by 1866 there were 39 tea gardens in Darjeeling, including the Makaibari Tea Estate which had established the region's first processing factory for withering and oxidation, necessary for the product to survive the months long journey down to Kolkata and over to Britain. Success of assamica at the nearby Dooars-Terai tea gardens led to infrastructure investments that would be extend up the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, allowing more machinery and supplies to reach the tea gardens. Darjeeling's population had grown from less than a 100 in the 1830s to 95,000 people with 100 tea gardens in 1885, predominately Indian Gorkha and Lepcha migrants from Nepal and Sikkim, as the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the use of steamships and the Suez Canal reduced shipping times. Darjeeling tea workers, 1890 After the British nationalized the East India Company it only ever leased the lands to tea garden owners on 30 year basis and maintained the practice of only permitting 40% to be used for tea crops with 40% being left natural and 20% for housing and facilities. Following Indian independence in 1947, practices shifted as British began to sell their stakes in the gardens to Indians and the 1953 Tea Act put the tea industry under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Tea Board of India. With more area being opened for tea crops at the expense of natural area and the introduction of pesticides and fertilizers, yields increased from 7.8 to 10 million kilograms between 1950 and 1960, though this came at the cost of increased soil instability. Despite a limited exemption for the tea industry the 1973 Foreign Exchange Regulations Act the new foreign ownership limitations resulted in Indian nationals becoming majority owners of the Darjeeling tea industry. As the Soviet Union replaced the United Kingdom as India's largest tea customers, Darjeeling gardens were supplemented with assamica plantings to accommodate their preference for that variety. Production methods again shifted in the 1990s as Western Europe and Japan replaced the collapsed Soviet Union as Darjeeling's principal customers and new garden managers were bringing the principles of biodynamic agriculture to their practices. In 1988, Makaibari became the first tea estate in India to attain organic certification, followed by Tumsong, and the first to gain biodynamic certification, in 1993, followed by Ambootia. Darjeeling could not compete with other tea regions in terms of quantity or price (due to its geographic limitations, remoteness, slower plant growth, inability to mechanize, among other factors) or so it focused on quality. While the certifications provided an indication of a superior product, its practices also helped the gardens cope with erosion, slope instability and soil depletion that had become prevalent with pesticide and artificial fertilizer applications on the rainy hillsides. Yields had reached 14 million kilograms in 1994 but, with organic practices over much of the tea gardens, yields fell to an average of 9 million kilograms in the late-2010s. In pursuit of differentiating Darjeeling tea, the Darjeeling Planter's Association had been established, in 1983, to promote the product in other countries and a logo was copyrighted, consisting of the side profile of a woman holding two leaves and a bud and registered it in various countries and then, once it was eligible, internationally in the Madrid system. In 2000, the Tea Board created new licensing requirements for Darjeeling tea exporters, including product authentication and a prohibition on blending, which allowed them to issue certificates of origin. In 2004, Darjeeling tea became India's first product to receive legal geographical indication protection under the World Trade Organization's TRIPS Agreement and in 2011 it was given Protected Geographical Indication status in the European Union.  Terrior  Environmental factors combined with a history of organized cultivation and processing has created a terrior unique to Darjeeling tea. It has been marketed as the \\"Champagne of teas\\" and been subject to undisclosed blending with other teas or purposeful mis-labelling. Relative to other teas, Darjeeling tea is most similar to Nepali tea. = Geography and climate = Darjeeling tea plantation Darjeeling tea is grown in the Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts, an area bound by Nepal to the west, Bhutan to the east and Sikkim to the north. The Tea Board of India defines \\"Darjeeling Tea\\" as havng \\"been cultivated, grown, produced, manufactured and processed in tea gardens in the hilly areas of Sadar Subdivision, only hilly areas of Kalimpong District..., and Kurseong subdivision...of the District of Darjeeling in the State of West Bengal, India.\\" The tea gardens are located on the hillsides of the Eastern Himalaya, between 600 and 2,000 metres in elevation. That physical geography of the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, between the Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal, results in the land experiencing cool air with dry winter months from November to February followed by monsoon weather in the summer months between July and September. The subtropical and wet temperate forest cover that developed under these conditions left slightly acidic loamy soils with high organic materials. Being on steep slopes, the soil is well-drained and deep enough for long root systems, necessary for anchoring soil on slopes. Being on the sides of the hills, at high elevations where cool dry air interacts with warm moist air, there can be persistent fog or cloud cover during the growing months. These are ideal conditions for the Camellia sinensis sinensis plant which flourishes with well-drained, slightly acidic soils, with periods of dormancy, and limited direct sunlight. = Cultivation = The Camellia sinensis seeds originally planted came from China but new plantings come predominately from saplings taken from a few cultivars, such as Bannockburn 157, Phoobsering 312 and Ambari Vegetative 2, which have been specifically adapted for Darjeeling. The climate creates four distinct periods of cultivation, each of which has unique characteristics. The plants are plucked by hand every five to ten days, most typically of their top two leaves and a bud, however, based on growing conditions and desired product just the bud or the bud and top leaf may sometimes be plucked. The first pluckings in Spring, generally March into May, are referred to as the first flush. These first leaves following the winter dormancy are the most tender leaves the plant will produce and result in a tea that has a gentle, very light colour and aroma, and a mild astringency (or briskness). The second flush is harvested in May and June, after the Empoasca and Homona coffearia have attacked the plant, releasing compounds that create a distinctive full-bodied muscatel flavour in the tea. The attacks by the leafhopper and moth release defensive chemicals from the plant and naturally begins oxidation process within the leaves. These first two flushes are the most sought after by tea connoisseurs. The plant rapidly grows during the monsoon flush from July to September with larger and less flavourful leaves. The persistent rain also results in less complete withering and oxidization during the processing stage. Some estates create green or white teas from these as they demand less withering and no oxidation, however, when completed as black tea this flush is often sold below the cost of production for use in blending and domestic consumption. After the rainy season, the final leaves grown before the plant's winter dormancy are referred to as the autumnal flush. They are harvested in October-November and provides a herbaceous and soft muscatel flavour but with a fuller body and darker colour than previous flushes, and is compared favorably with Nepali teas. =Processing= With few exceptions, Darjeeling produces black teas. Each tea estate operates their own equipment so that processing can begin the same day as plucking. The leaves are first brought indoors where they are air blown overnight to dry them sufficiently so that their cells can be ruptured, initiating oxidation, when rolled without breaking the leaf. Darjeeling teas, especially the first flush, tend to be withered longer than other black teas; a hard wither can reduce a leaf's water content by more than half, affecting polyphenol oxidase activity and leaving a more green appearance. Some tea estates will produce a batch of Darjeeling oolong tea by limiting the amount of oxidation. After rolling, the leaves are left to oxidize on trays before being fired to reduce the moisture level down to approximately 2% and sealing the ruptures which will be reopened with consumer's hot water. The sorting of the dried product according to tea leaf grading is completed and shipped to Kolkata for auctioning, though many estates sell privately under contracts. =Preparation, flavour and aroma= With the exception of the first flush, orthodox (ie. not crush, tear, curl) Darjeeling teas are generally prepared in the same manner as other black teas. Tea connoisseurs recommend a water temperature ranging between to in a single infusion of 3 to 4 minutes, whereas first flushes, like other early spring teas such as Jin Jun Mei tea, use water of slightly lower temperature at 85 to 90¬∞C and an infusion time of 2 to 3 minutes. For every 150 milliliters ( cup) of water used, 2 to 3 grams (one tablespoon) of loose leaf tea is added. As Darjeeling teas are low in malt and bitter characteristics and is appreciated for its delicate floral and fruit aromas, milk and sweeteners are typically not added. Their high tannin content allows them to be paired well with carbohydrate-rich foods, such as baked goods and pasta. Darjeeling teas are best known for the muscatel flavour, described as a \\"musky spiciness,\\" \\"a unique muscat-like fruitiness in aroma and flavour,\\" that develops in the second flush and is present to a lesser degree in the subsequent autumnal flush. While general tea flavours are created by thearubigins and theaflavins, chemical analysis on Darjeeling teas show their unique muscatel flavour is the result of 3,7-dimethyl-1,5,7-octatrien-3-ol and 2,6-dimethyl-3,7-octa- diene-2,6-diol, with other aromatic compounds coming from linalool, benzyl alcohol, cis-3-hexenol, Œ±-farnesene, benzyl nitrile, indole, nerolidol and ocimene. Otherwise, Darjeeling teas are described as possessing a flowery fragrance and fruity (grapes, plums, apricots, peaches, pineapple, guava, or citrus fruits), flowery and woody aroma notes, and a little more astringency than its Chinese counterparts.  Organization  The Tea Board of India recognizes 87 tea estates (also called \\"tea gardens\\") as producers of Darjeeling tea. Cumulatively, they cover 17,500 hectares of land. Apart from these estates, a relatively small amount of tea is produced in farm cooperatives but they lack processing and quality control infrastructure. Some of the notable tea estates include:  width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"{}\\" valign=\\"{}\\" style=\\"border:0\\" * Arya * Avongrove * Badamtam * Balasun * Castleton  width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"{}\\" valign=\\"{}\\" style=\\"border:0\\" * Glenburn * Gopaldhara * Happy Valley * Jungpana * Lopchu  width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"{}\\" valign=\\"{}\\" style=\\"border:0\\" * Makaibari * Margaret's Hope * North Tukvar * Okayti * Phoobsering  width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"{}\\" valign=\\"{}\\" style=\\"border:0\\" * Phuguri * Pussimbing * Puttabong * Thurbo Women plucking tea on a Darjeeling tea estate The Government of West Bengal owns the land on which the estates are located and administer 30 to 90 year leases under the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act to companies operating the estates. The West Bengal government is also involved in providing regulatory supervision of numerous aspects of estate operations, including land use and labour agreements. The Darjeeling Tea Association (affiliated with the Indian Tea Association) is the trade association that represents the tea estates and exporters in business and labour affairs. They jointly negotiate together with the various unions and the government so that workers across numerous tea estates receive the same compensation. Labour relations are complex as, in addition to the seasonal influx of temporary workers, the permanent workers can be permanent residents of the estates where, pursuant to the Plantations Labour Act, housing, education, health and other services are provided by the estate, in addition to a base salary. Because the provision of these services are required by law, fair trade organizations, such as the Fairtrade International, allow their fair trade premiums be paid to plantation owners, rather than the workers, on condition that the owners can only use the premium to offset some of the costs of providing these services. Studies of this arrangement have suggested that this has negatively effected the livelihoods of labourers, as owners have more than correspondingly reduced their contributions to the required services. This also complicates wage negotiations as marginal increases are feared to come at the expense of a loss of social services. However, the low wages contribute to a high rate of absenteeism of workers seeking higher paying work elsewhere. The tea estate workers have historically relied on workers coming from Nepal as a source of inexpensive labour. Consequently, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong and their tea estates are populated predominately by Indian Gorkha people. They have developed a unified ethnic identity and advocated for independence from West Bengal. Occassionally, actions of the Gorkhaland movement have disrupted operations of the Darjeeling tea estates, such as the 2017 bandh.

It is located about 10 km west of Kamloops Lake, and is 65 km west of Kamloops on the south shore of the Thompson River near Highway 1. The population is 31 (2018) and the postal code is V0K 2P0. In its heyday, from 1909 until 1914, this historic town was an affluent colony of English settlers and was often termed \\"Canada's Camelot\\". History Walhachin Hotel (1910) Walhachin was first named \\"Pennie's\\", after the original settler, Charles Pennie. But the true saga of Walhachin would begin in 1907 when Charles Barnes, an American entrepreneur, was working as a land surveyor at Ashcroft and visited Pennie's ranch and admired his orchard. Despite the fact that Walhachin lies in the center of British Columbia's dry belt and has an average annual rainfall of less than 20 cm, Barnes envisioned thousands of acres of lush orchards and an elegant community of gentlemen farmers, primarily members of the English upper-class and aristocracy. For financial backing of this grand vision he contacted a company in England, the British Columbia Development Association, who had already invested in several British Columbia properties including the ranch at 111 Mile House on the Cariboo Road. Barnes invited Sir William Bass, and an agriculturist and an engineer to come view the property. The men endorsed Barnes' plan and reported back to the BCDA that the land was a good investment and on January 21, 1908, they purchased the Pennie Ranch and an additional parcel for $200 an acre for a total of $229,400. The BCDA then created two subsidiary companies, the British Columbia Horticultural Estates Limited to market the plots of farmland, and the Dry Belt Settlement Utilities Limited to market lots on the townsite. Charles Barnes became the manager of BC Horticultural Estates Ltd and purchased an additional from the Dominion Government for a dollar an acre. Plowing for the orchards at Walhachin (1910) In 1909 the town was named Walhachin (which means \\"Land of the Round Rock\\" in the Nlaka'pamux (Thompson) language). However, when a thirty page pamphlet was printed in England, the name Walhachin was interpreted to mean \\"Bountiful Valley\\". The advertising campaign was successful and most of the people who purchased the land were so convinced by the pamphlet's glowing reports that they bought the property sight unseen. An addition incentive was given to the new settlers when the Canadian government allowed them to bring in their personal effects without paying a duty. This was a major consideration to many of the newcomers, who would only consider moving to the Canadian wilderness if they could bring all the lavish comforts of home with them. Soon Barnes' vision of the elegant orchard community had been realized and all of the new land owners were titled or upper-class Englishmen. Walhachin was no ordinary pioneer community, but boasted luxurious amenities that were nearly unheard of in other towns of the era. The Walhachin Hotel had an elegantly appointed dining room, three rotundas and offered quality accommodations. It also had a strictly enforced dress code. Many of the townspeople lived in fine stone homes with high ceilings and large fireplaces and had servants, maids and valets. In town, there was a Chinese laundry, a polo field, a swimming pool, a skating rink and tennis courts. Excavating the irrigation ditch at Walhachin (1910) The biggest problem that the new settlers at Walhachin faced was irrigating the orchards, as most of the properties had no water supply. To solve the problem, the residents decided to build a flume that would carry water down the mountainside to irrigation ditches. By April 1910, they had built of flume and ditches on the north bank of the Thompson River, but due to improper construction of the flume and shaky trestles, it couldn't carry as much water as was needed to irrigate the orchards during excessively dry periods. Nevertheless, the community persevered and by 1914, there were 300 residents.Walhachin, British Columbia, Canada Despite the hardships and trials that these newcomers faced, it was not through their weakness or lack of knowledge that the dream of Walhachin failed, but the onset of the Great War which caused many of the British residents to return home to fight for their country. Most would never return and by 1922 the last resident of Walhachin had left. Recent activity is the quarrying of rock, close above the townsite, for railbed ballast. Residents are occasionally bombarded by flying stone debris from the blasting operations. This quarry can be seen from Highway 1 as a black scar on the hillside above the town. As this area is cattle ranching country, much of the arable, flat land is planted to alfalfa for winter hay. The hot, dry climate, and irrigation water from the river, enable two or three crops each summer.

After the 7 July 2005 London bombings, she claimed to have tended to the attack victims as a doctor, though she did not have any medical qualifications. She was found dead shortly after coming to the attention of the press. Initially, it was suspected that she might have committed suicide, but it emerged later that she died of natural causes.  Early life  Oates-Whitehead was born and brought up in Gisborne, New Zealand. She suffered from epilepsy in her childhood. She displayed interest in becoming a physician or entering the medical profession right from her school days. Her school friends described her as a caring person. While she did not become a physician, she trained as a radiation therapist for a year in 1991, working on a study on prevention of blood coagulation. This included an internship at Auckland. She moved to London in 2001, and prior to her last employment with British Medical Association (BMA) as an editor of Clinical Evidence (an online journal of the British Medical Journal), she was with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in the role of clinical effectiveness coordinator. Immediately prior to her employment at the BMA she worked as a medical writer for Euro RSCG Medical Education; throughout her brief employment at this company she posed as a doctor.  London bombings  Oates-Whitehead came to attention in the aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings at Tavistock Square. She claimed to have been asked to help out by some firemen and that she did not hesitate for a moment. She was widely hailed as a \\"heroine\\", after her accounts of treating the seriously injured were carried out by the press, especially in New Zealand. Subsequently, the New Zealand Herald, among others, researched her background and found that she was not a doctor, but an editor of a BMA publication, a job that did not require medical qualifications. The media's suspicion was triggered by an account by Oates-Whitehead of how she heard a controlled explosion of another bomb by the police while she was busy tending to the victims. Scotland Yard's denial of such an explosion and the absence of her name on either of the UK or the New Zealand Medical Council registers of doctors strengthened the suspicions. Nor could the University of Auckland confirm that she was a graduate of the institution. Oates-Whitehead contested the newspaper's contention and threatened to sue it for defamation, but resigned from her post on health grounds when BMA announced an inquiry into her antecedents. The controlled explosion that Oates-Whitehead heard was later reported by others. According to the Richmond and Twickenham Times newspaper there was a controlled explosion of a suspect package on the bus: 'Sergeant Graham Cross and his unit of five were trying to set up a cordon around the King's Cross bombing when the number 30 bus was blown up in Tavistock Square. \\"We were only 100 metres away,\\" Mr Cross said. Team member PC Ashley Walker was looking at the bus as it exploded before his eyes. As they ran closer, they saw \\"people's body parts and lumps of flesh\\", PC Walker remembers. One man's legs were trapped under a bench, while another mangled victim hanged with his head over the edge of the bombed top deck. Then they spotted a microwave box near a window. Another bomb? They thought it was. \\"But we had no choice, really,\\" Mr Graham says. \\"We had to go get people off the bus.\\" A bomb disposal unit later blew up the package in a controlled explosion.' Testimony given at the Coroner's Inquest confirms the controlled explosion of the microwave oven: Transcript: Q. In relation to secondary devices, you were aware, I think, during your time at the scene, in relation to secondary devices, of the attendance of a Metropolitan Police explosives unit, explosives officer. Is that right? A. That's correct. Q. I think, to use the phrase that you did in your recent statement in which you went over your actions on the day itself, you noted that the box that you considered may have contained a secondary device‚Äîwhich would be the microwave oven, as it transpired to be ‚Äî was neutralised by the explosives officer. There was a controlled explosion at one stage carried out by explosives officers that day. Was that subsequent‚Äîput it another way, was that something that occurred or that didn't occur while you were there? A. Sorry? Q. The question is probably poorly phrased. Were you aware of a controlled explosion? A. Yes. Q. -- or simply the attendance of explosives officers? A. I heard the controlled explosion, yes. Q. Right. I don't suppose you can provide a time for that, can you, or can you? A. After 30 minutes. That's my guess, I can't know. Q. All right. That's all I want to ask about that.  Death  Following apprehensions from her family members, the Police entered her flat in West London on 17 August and found her dead body. Initially it was believed that she might have committed suicide due to the possible media witch hunt and loss of her job. However, post-mortem reports suggested that she died of a pulmonary embolism. The Coroner‚Äôs office ruled out an inquest as the death was due to natural causes.  Alleged personality disorder  Newspaper reports indicate that Oates-Whitehead seemed to suffer from some personality disorder. She always carried a stethoscope in her handbag despite not being a doctor; described herself as an epidemiologist or a professor in her correspondence and told others that she travelled to Iraq and Indonesia to provide medical assistance to the war victims and the tsunami victims respectively. Her claims also included being afflicted with cancer, being stalked, suffering a mini heart attack, references to a retired professor as partner and giving birth to premature twins who died within a day. A common thread of appeal for either admiration or sympathy seems to have run through her stories.

With deadline-monotonic priority assignment, tasks are assigned priorities according to their deadlines. The task with the shortest deadline is assigned the highest priority. This priority assignment policy is optimal for a set of periodic or sporadic tasks which comply with the following system model: # All tasks have deadlines less than or equal to their minimum inter-arrival times (or periods). # All tasks have worst-case execution times (WCET) that are less than or equal to their deadlines. # All tasks are independent, and so do not block each other's execution (e.g., by accessing mutually exclusive shared resources). # No task voluntarily suspends itself. # There is some point in time, referred to as a critical instant, where all of the tasks become ready to execute simultaneously. # Scheduling overheads (switching from one task to another) are zero. # All tasks have zero release jitter (the time from the task arriving to it becoming ready to execute). If restriction 7 is lifted, then \\"deadline minus jitter\\" monotonic priority assignment is optimal. If restriction 1 is lifted, allowing deadlines greater than periods, then Audsley's optimal priority assignment algorithm may be used to find the optimal priority assignment.

In that context and when looking at a decision of whether to adopt a new treatment technology, there is always some degree of uncertainty surrounding the decision, because there is always a chance that the decision turns out to be wrong. The expected value of perfect information analysis tries to measure the expected cost of that uncertainty, which ‚Äúcan be interpreted as the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), since perfect information can eliminate the possibility of making the wrong decision‚Äù at least from a theoretical perspective.  Equation  The problem is modeled with a payoff matrix Rij in which the row index i describes a choice that must be made by the player, while the column index j describes a random variable that the player does not yet have knowledge of, that has probability pj of being in state j. If the player is to choose i without knowing the value of j, the best choice is the one that maximizes the expected monetary value: : \\\\mbox{EMV} = \\\\max_i \\\\sum_j p_j R_{ij} where : \\\\sum_j p_j R_{ij} is the expected payoff for action i i.e. the expectation value, and : \\\\mbox{EMV} = \\\\max_i is choosing the maximum of these expectations for all available actions. On the other hand, with perfect knowledge of j, the player may choose a value of i that optimizes the expectation for that specific j. Therefore, the expected value given perfect information is : \\\\mbox{EV}\\\\mbox{PI} = \\\\sum_j p_j (\\\\max_i R_{ij}), where p_j is the probability that the system is in state j, and R_{ij} is the pay-off if one follows action i while the system is in state j. Here (\\\\max_i R_{ij}), indicates the best choice of action i for each state j. The expected value of perfect information is the difference between these two quantities, : \\\\mbox{EVPI} = \\\\mbox{EV}\\\\mbox{PI} - \\\\mbox{EMV}. This difference describes, in expectation, how much larger a value the player can hope to obtain by knowing j and picking the best i for that j, as compared to picking a value of i before j is known. Since EVPI is necessarily greater than or equal to EMV, EVPI is always non-negative. EVPI provides a criterion by which to judge ordinary imperfectly informed forecasters. EVPI can be used to reject costly proposals: if one is offered knowledge for a price larger than EVPI, it would be better to refuse the offer. However, it is less helpful when deciding whether to accept a forecasting offer, because one needs to know the quality of the information one is acquiring. Example Setup: Suppose you were going to make an investment into only one of three investment vehicles: stock, mutual fund, or certificate of deposit (CD). Further suppose, that the market has a 50% chance of increasing, a 30% chance of staying even, and a 20% chance of decreasing. If the market increases the stock investment will earn $1500 and the mutual fund will earn $900. If the market stays even the stock investment will earn $300 and the mutual fund will earn $600. If the market decreases the stock investment will lose $800 and the mutual fund will lose $200. The certificate of deposit will earn $500 independent of the market's fluctuation. Question: What is the expected value of perfect information? Solution: Here the payoff matrix is: :R = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1500 & 300 & -800  900 & 600 & -200  500 & 500 & 500 \\\\end{bmatrix} The probability vector is: :p = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0.5  0.3  0.2 \\\\end{bmatrix} Expectation for each vehicle (Rp): : \\\\mbox{Exp}_\\\\text{stock} = 0.5 \\\\times1500 + 0.3\\\\times300 + 0.2\\\\times(-800) = 680 : \\\\mbox{Exp}_\\\\text{mutual fund} = 0.5\\\\times900 + 0.3\\\\times600 + 0.2\\\\times(-200) = 590 : \\\\mbox{Exp}_\\\\text{certificate of deposit} = 0.5\\\\times500 + 0.3\\\\times500 + 0.2\\\\times500 = 500 The maximum of these expectations is the stock vehicle. Not knowing which direction the market will go (only knowing the probability of the directions), we expect to make the most money with the stock vehicle. Thus, :\\\\mbox{EMV} = 680 On the other hand, consider if we did know ahead of time which way the market would turn. Given the knowledge of the direction of the market we would (potentially) make a different investment vehicle decision. Expectation for maximizing profit given the state of the market: : \\\\mbox{EV}\\\\mbox{PI} = 0.5\\\\times1500 + 0.3\\\\times600 + 0.2\\\\times500 = 1030 That is, given each market direction, we choose the investment vehicle that maximizes the profit. Hence, : \\\\mbox{EVPI} = \\\\mbox{EV}\\\\mbox{PI} - \\\\mbox{EMV} = 1030 - 680 = 350. Conclusion: Knowing the direction the market will go (i.e. having perfect information) is worth $350. Discussion: If someone was selling information that guaranteed the accurate prediction of the future market direction, we would want to purchase this information only if the price was less than $350. If the price was greater than $350 we would not purchase the information, if the price was less than $350 we would purchase the information. If the price was exactly $350, then our decision is futile. Suppose the price for the information was $349.99 and we purchased it. Then we would expect to make 1030 - 349.99 = 680.01 > 680. Therefore, by purchasing the information we were able to make $0.01 more than if we didn't purchase the information. Suppose the price for the information was $350.01 and we purchased it. Then we would expect to make 1030 - 350.01 = 679.99 < 680\\\\. Therefore, by purchasing the information we lost $0.01 when compared to not having purchased the information. Suppose the price for the information was $350.00 and we purchased it. Then we would expect to make 1030 - 350.00 = 680.00 = 680. Therefore, by purchasing the information we did not gain nor lose any money by deciding to purchase this information when compared to not purchasing the information. Note: As a practical example, there is a cost to using money to purchase items (time value of money), which must be considered as well.

Early life and education Gunter Faltin was born on 25 November 1944 in Bamberg, Germany. He graduated with a Dr. rer.soc. from the University of Konstanz in 1972. Career =Academia= In 1977 he became Professor of Economics at the Free University of Berlin, where he established the entrepreneurship department. Since 2013 he has been teaching as visiting professor at Chiang Mai University. He was appointed for several years visiting professor to Asia by the German Academic Exchange Service. He gave lectures and workshops on entrepreneurship in many countries, among them the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, South Korea, and Japan. From 1984 to 1988 he was deputy president of the German Society for Education, Invention and Innovation,(DABEIDABEI) Berlin Section. In 1999 he founded the Entrepreneurship Lab at Free University of Berlin, which was adopted by Volkswagen's ‚ÄúInnovationscampus Wolfsburg\\"Innovationscampus Wolfsburg in 2000. From 2000 - 2003 he served as an expert for the project \\"Entrepreneurship in Education and Training in Russia and Ukraine\\", he conducted a series of workshops for the European Union's European Training Foundation in St. Petersburg and Kiev from 2000 to 2003. In 2010 he followed an invitation of the government of Bhutan for a keynote to the conference on ‚ÄúHigh Tech and Entrepreneurship\\". =Business= In 1985, he founded the Projektwerkstatt GmbH, based on the \\"Teekampagne\\" (\\"tea campaign\\"). The \\"Teekampagne\\" is the world's largest importer of Darjeeling leaf tea, according to the Tea Board of India. In 1992 Faltin launched and sponsored the reforestation project S.E.R.V.E. (‚ÄúSave the Environment & Regenerate Vital Employment\\"); the WWF is taking charge of the project on location in Darjeeling, India. Faltin is business angel and coach of startup companies such as eBuero AG (2001), RatioDrink AG (2006), and Waschkampagne. In 2001 he established the Stiftung Entrepreneurship, a foundation aimed at furthering entrepreneurship and hosting the yearly \\"Entrepreneurship Summit\\". Teachings Central to Faltin's teachings is that entrepreneurship today is available to everybody, not just for those with capital and patents. He dissociates clearly entrepreneurship from business administration. In a postindustrial society a well thought out entrepreneurial design is more decisive for the success of a start-up company than having much capital.

History Due to their music being produced by former Every Little Thing member Mitsuru Igarashi, Day After Tomorrow's music took on a decidedly similar feel to that group's music, particularly the more synthpop- based music that Every Little Thing released in their earlier years. As of the release of their best albums in August 2005, Day After Tomorrow had gone on hiatus as a result of a scandal from the media.Japan Entertainment News Archives for May 2005 Kitano, one of the members of the band, was dating Sayaka, the daughter of pop star Seiko Matsuda. Media reports had also alleged that this was the main reason for the group's hiatus. Since the hiatus, Misono had performed as a soloist between 2006 and 2014, after which she quit music, though still performs on television variety programs. Daisuke Suzuki went on to play keyboard for the band Girl Next Door. Misono's older sister is Koda Kumi.

Before moving to Spain, Pamarot played for Portsmouth in the Premier League. He is a right-footed defender who is also known for his great strength. Pamarot has previously played for Martigues, Nice and Tottenham Hotspur and also had a brief loan spell at Portsmouth in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Club career =Tottenham Hotspur= In the 2004‚Äì05 season he played 23 times for Tottenham Hotspur before seriously injuring his right knee at the start of April in a match against Birmingham City at St Andrew's. Before that he headed the winning goal away at Everton, one of his two goals for the club, the other coming in the FA Cup against Nottingham Forest. =Portsmouth= Pamarot was transferred from Tottenham to Portsmouth in January 2006 in a ¬£7.5 million deal that also took Sean Davis and Pedro Mendes to Portsmouth. He scored his first Portsmouth goal away against Arsenal in December 2006. Matthew Taylor's free kick was headed on by David Thompson and rebounded off the post into the path of Pamarot. He scored again in the next game, with another header, in a 3‚Äì1 home win over Sheffield United. Pamarot subsequently scored a brace of goals against Leeds United in the League Cup in 2007, as well as a 30-yard strike against Newcastle United in the Premier League. He was an unused substitute as Portsmouth won the 2008 FA Cup Final. His only contribution to the victorious campaign was playing the full 90 minutes of their fourth round win over Plymouth Argyle. Pamarot was released by Portsmouth following the expiration of his contract in the summer of 2009. =H√©rcules= On 28 August 2009, Pamarot signed for the Spanish team H√©rcules on an initial two-year contract. Pamarot was the undisputed first- choice center-back during his first season with the Valencian, who finished 19th and were immediately relegated back. In mid-July 2011, he signed with another top-divisioner, Granada CF. Pamarot only played 2 games for Granada CF and therefore returned to H√©rcules to playout the rest of his career in the Segunda Division.

Health geography is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care.  Overview  The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of social geography due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well- being in general. Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or alternative medicine and traditional medicine) are studied by the medicine researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without medical education. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as health consumers.Philo, Chris (2009). \\"Health and Health Care\\". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition). Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326 This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as Marxian political economy, structuralism, social interactionism, humanism, feminism and queer theory.Philo, Chris (2009). \\"Medical Geography\\". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition). Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453  History  The relationship between space and health dates back to Hippocrates, who stated that \\"airs, waters, places\\" all played significant roles impacting human health and history. A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as a cholera outbreak gripped a neighborhood in London. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. John Snow predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit. He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased. Areas of study Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving descriptive research quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and analytic research concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or population susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of epidemiology. The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization. This requires the use of spatial analysis and often borrows from behavioral economics. = Geographies of disease and ill health = Health geographers are concerned with the prevalence of different diseases along a range of spatial scales from a local to global view, and inspects the natural world, in all of its complexity, for correlations between diseases and locations. This situates health geography alongside other geographical sub-disciplines that trace human-environment relations. Health geographers use modern spatial analysis tools to map the dispersion of various diseases, as individuals spread them amongst themselves, and across wider spaces as they migrate. Health geographers also consider all types of spaces as presenting health risks, from natural disasters, to interpersonal violence, stress, and other potential dangers. Health insurance coverage = Geography of health care provision = Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all individuals. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care. Mobility and Disease Tracking: With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track individual mobility. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While privacy laws question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people.

The Newton disc, also known as the Disappearing Colour Disc, is a well-known physics experiment with a rotating disc with segments in different colors (usually Newton's primary colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet or ROYGBIV) appearing as white (or off-white or gray) when it spins very fast. This type of mix of light stimuli is called temporal optical mixing, a version of additive-averaging mixing. The concept that human visual perception cannot distinguish details of high-speed movements is popularly known as persistence of vision. The disc is named after Isaac Newton. Although he published a circular diagram with segments for the primary colors that he had discovered, it is uncertain whether he actually ever used a spinning disc to demonstrate the principles of light. Transparent variations for magic lantern projection have been produced. History Around 165 CE, Ptolemy described in his book Optics a rotating potter's wheel with different colors on it. He noted how the different colors of sectors mixed together into one color and how dots appeared as circles when the wheel was spinning very fast. When lines are drawn across the axis of the disc they make the whole surface appear to be of a uniform color. \\"The visual impression that is created in the first revolution is invariably followed by repeated instances that subsequently produce an identical impression. This also happens in the case of shooting stars, whose light seems distended on account of their speed of motion, all according to the amount of perceptible distance it passes along with the sensible impression that arises in the visual faculty.\\" Porphyry ( ‚Äì ) wrote in his commentary on Ptolemy's Harmonics how the senses are not stable but confused and inaccurate. Certain intervals between repeated impressions are not detected. A white or black spot on a spinning cone (or top) appears as a circle of that color and a line on the top makes the whole surface appear in that color. \\"Because of the swiftness of the movement we receive the impression of the line on every part of the cone as the line moves.\\" in the 11th century Ibn al-Haytam, who was familiar with Ptolemy's writings, described how colored lines on a spinning top could not be discerned as different colors but appeared as one new color composed of all of the colors of the lines. He deducted that sight needs some time to discern a color. al-Haytam also noted that the top appeared motionless when spun extremely quick \\"for none of its points remains fixed in the same spot for any perceptible time\\". =Newton's primary colours= On 6 February 1671, Isaac Newton wrote a paper about the experiments he had been conducting since 1666 with the refraction of light through glass prisms. He concluded that the different refracted rays of light ‚Äì well parted from others ‚Äì could not be changed by further refraction, nor by reflection or other means, except through mixture with other rays. He thus found the seven primary colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, \\"a violet-purple\\" and indigo. When mixing the coloured rays from a prism, he found that \\"the most surprising and wonderful composition was that of whiteness\\" requiring all the primary colors \\"mixed in a due proportion\\". In his book Opticks (1704‚Äì30), Newton described a device with prisms, a lens and a large moving comb with teeth causing alternating colors to be projected successively. \\"But if I so much accelerated the Motion, that the Colours by reason of their quick Succession could not be distinguished from one another, the Appearance of the single Colours ceased. There was no red, no yellow, no green, no blue, nor purple to be seen any longer, but from a Confusion of them all there arose one uniform white Colour.\\" Newton noted that the same principle is visible in the way a soapy froth displays colours when seen up close but appears as white from a small distance. Although a mix of powder pigments of the primary colors appeared grey, Newton demonstrated that it looked perfectly white when seen in bright sunlight from a small distance. After presenting his conclusions about dividing sunlight into primary colors and mixing them back together into white light, Newton presented a color circle to illustrate the relations between these colors. Many modern sources state that Isaac Newton himself used a spinning disc with colored sectors to demonstrate how white light was actually the compound of the primary colors. However, these do not reference any historical source.

The tale was first published in 1847.  Plot summary  Once a learned man from the northern regions of Europe went on a voyage south. One night, he sat on his terrace, while the fire behind him cast his shadow on the opposite balcony. As he was sitting there, resting, the man was amused to observe how the shadow followed his every movement, as if he really did sit upon the opposing balcony. When he finally grew tired and went to sleep, he imagined the shadow would likewise retire in the house across the street. The next morning however, the man found to his surprise that he in fact had lost his shadow overnight. As a new shadow slowly grew back from the tip of his toes, the man did not give the incident another thought, returned to northern Europe, and took up writing again. Several years passed by until one night there was a knock at his door. To his surprise, it was his shadow, the one he lost years before in Africa, and now stood upon his doorstep, almost completely human in appearance. Astonished by his sudden reappearance, the learned man invited him into his house, and soon the two sat by the fireplace, as the shadow related how he had come to be a man. The learned man was calm and gentle by nature. His main object of interest lay with the good, the beautiful and the true, a subject of which he wrote often but was of no interest to anyone else. The shadow said his master did not understand the world, that he had seen it as truly was, and how evil some men really were. The shadow then grew richer and fatter over the years, while the writer grew poorer and paler. Finally he had become so ill that his former shadow proposed a trip to a health resort offering to foot the bill as well, but on condition that he could act as the master now, and the writer would pretend to be his shadow. As absurd as this suggestion sounded, the learned man eventually agreed and together they took the trip, the shadow now as his master. At the resort, the shadow met with a beautiful princess, and as they danced and talked with each other each night, the princess fell in love with him. When they were about to be married, the shadow offered his former master a luxurious position at the palace, on condition that he now became his own shadow permanently. The writer immediately refused and threatened to tell the princess everything, but the shadow had him arrested. Feigning distress, the shadow met with the princess and told her: {  :\\"I have gone through the most terrible affair that could possibly happen; only imagine, my shadow has gone mad; I suppose such a poor, shallow brain, could not bear much; he fancies that he has become a real man, and that I am his shadow.\\" :\\"How very terrible,‚Äù cried the princess; \\"is he locked up?\\" :\\"Oh yes, certainly; for I fear he will never recover.\\" :\\"Poor shadow!\\" said the princess; \\"it is very unfortunate for him; it would really be a good deed to free him from his frail existence; and, indeed, when I think how often people take the part of the lower class against the higher, in these days, it would be policy to put him out of the way quietly.\\"  :\\"Jeg har oplevet det Grueligste, der kan opleves!\\" sagde Skyggen, \\"t√¶nk Dig ‚Äì ja, saadan en stakkels Skyggehjerne kan ikke holde meget ud! ‚Äì T√¶nk Dig, min Skygge er blevet gal, han troer at han er Mennesket og at jeg ‚Äì t√¶nk dig bare, ‚Äì at jeg er hans Skygge!\\" :\\"Det er frygteligt!\\" sagde Prinsessen, \\"han er dog sp√¶rret inde?\\" :\\"Det er han! Jeg er bange han kommer sig aldrig.\\" :\\"Stakkels Skygge!\\" sagde Prinsessen, \\"han er meget ulykkelig; det er en sand Velgjerning at frie ham fra den Smule Liv han har, og naar jeg rigtig t√¶nker over det, saa troer jeg det bliver n√∏dvendigt at det bliver gjort af med ham i al Stilhed!\\" } When the shadow wed the princess later that night, he learned that the man was already executed.  Analysis  The Shadow is an exemplary story in Andersen's darker fairy tales. Throughout the tale, the writer is portrayed as a moral person, concerned with the good and true in the world. But as it says, the people around him are not much interested in his feelings on the subject. Indeed, his shadow says he does not see the world as it truly is. The shadow claims to have seen all that is in the world, but does not own a soul himself. He strongly desires to own a shadow of himself, and later asks his former master to reverse the roles on their trip. When the learned man finally realises how far his shadow has degraded, it is already too late. The ending is especially bleak for a fairy tale, as Andersen suggests that it is not always good that triumphs, and that evil does indeed have a powerful grip over the good and just. Some critics have suggested that Andersen wrote the story as a form of indirect revenge against Edvard Collin, his patron's son, who had rejected him.Jacqueline Banerjee, The Impact of Hans Christian Andersen on Victorian Fiction, The Victorian Web, 12 December 2008.  Publication  \\"The Shadow\\" was first published 6 April 1847 as a part of New Fairy Tales. Second Volume. First Collection. 1847. (Nye Eventyr. Andet Bind. F√∏rste Samling. 1847.). The work was re-published December 1847 as a part of A Christmas Greeting to my English Friends, and again 18 December 1849 as a part of Fairy Tales. 1850. (Eventyr. 1850.). The tale was re-published 30 March 1863 as a part of Fairy Tales and Stories. Second Volume. 1863. (Eventyr og Historier. Andet Bind. 1863.).Hans Christian Andersen Center: Hans Christian Andersen: The Shadow  Precedent  In 1814, three decades before the publication of \\"The Shadow\\", Adelbert von Chamisso had published \\"Peter Schlemihl's Miraculous Story\\", a story about a man who sells his shadow to the devil in exchange for a bottomless wallet. Andersen's story was prompted by Chamisso's, and he refers to it in \\"The Shadow\\": > He was very annoyed, not so much because the shadow had disappeared, but > because he knew there was a story; well-known to everybody at home in the > cold countries, about a man without a shadow; and if he went back now and > told them his own story, they would be sure to say that he was just an > imitator, and that was the last thing he wanted. Andersen's story in turn appears to have influenced Oscar Wilde's \\"The Fisherman and His Soul\\".  Adaptations  The Shadow became the first text of some considerable length to be published in Esperanto. It was contained in the 1888 Dua Libro (Second Book) by the creator of that language, L. L. Zamenhof (the first book had contained only single bible verses, short poems and the like). Evgeny Shvarts has explicitly based his Tyen (The Shadow) play on Andersen's tale, introducing additional characters and plot lines and a different ending. In 1945 the story was adapted as an episode of the syndicated radio program The Weird Circle. In 1994 Frederik Magle, Thomas Eje, Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen and others released the album The Song Is a Fairytale with songs based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairytales. \\"The Shadow\\" is one of the songs. Skuggaleikur (Shadow Play) is an opera by Icelandic composer Kar√≥l√≠na Eir√≠ksd√≥ttir with libretto by Sj√≥n. Premiered in November 2006. In 2003, the Carolina Ballet premiered a ballet version of The Shadow with choreography by artistic director Robert Weiss, set to the music of Khachaturian, Kabalevsky, Gyorgy Ligeti, Faur√© and Rachmaninoff. The ballet features an eerie sequence in which the poet contemplates his shadow in the mirror. The image, which at first copies his movements in complete synchrony, seamlessly emerges from the mirror frame (through effective changes in lighting) as another dancer in a gray full body stocking.

The tribe is found mostly in Maharashtra and parts of Madhya Pradesh however small numbers can be found in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. The word Pardhi is derived from the Marathi (state language) word ‚ÄòParadh‚Äô which means hunting and Sanskrit word ‚Äòpapardhi‚Äô which means hunting or the game to be hunted. In some parts of India Pardhis are known as Meywarees. They also have various other names like Advichincher, Phans Pardhi, Phanse Pardhi, Langoli Pardhi, Bahelia, Bahellia, Chita Pardhi, Shikari, Takankar, Takia Pardhi. Pardhi tribe is divided in groups like Vaghri Pardhi and Phase Pardhi. These are further divided into subgroups like Pal Pardhi, Gav Pardhi, Takankar, Takari. Widely found surnames among them include Chauhan (Chavan), Rathod and Solanke.History of Paradhis ambedkar.org History The Pardhis are descendants of the Rajputs. Pardhis‚Äô Rajput origin is confirmed by the fact that they have Rajput clan names and still speak Rajasthani dialect among them. Their names commonly end with the suffix \\"-singh\\". The Pardhis have common surnames like Rathod, Sindiya, Chauhan (Chavan). They have also taken up Maratha surnames like Pawar, Shinde and Dabhade. They originated from Rajasthan. From Rajasthan they migrated to Maharashtra and other states through Gujarat. While in Gujarat, they took up Gujarati culture. They intermixed with Gujarati community and started speaking their language and also started worshipping Khodiyar Mata as their Kuldevi.  Present day distribution  Pardhi Children According to the 1901 census the total number of Pardhi population was 12,214 of which 6,320 men and 5,894 women. During the same period in the state of Madhya Pradesh in the cities of Bhopal, Raisen and Sehore the total population of Pardhis were 1831. In the same state Bahelias and Chitas are also grouped with Pardhis. According to the 1981 census their number is 8,066. In Gujarat in 1981 census, Pardhi population is 814. In Maharashtra the Pardhi population is 95,115 (census data, 1981). According to 2001 census the total population of Pardhis in Maharashtra is 159,875. They are mainly spread over the districts of Amravati (20,568) Akola (17,578) Buldhana (16428) Jalgaon (16,849) Yavatmal (8,129) Osmanabad (9,959) Pune (7,230) and the other districts they are scattered. The Pardhi population data o f Mumbai is not available in the census record.  Language  Pardhis speak mixed dialects of Rajasthani and Gujarati mainly Wagdi language and Pardhi language. These languages are grouped in Bhil languages of western Indo-Aryan language group. The Bhil languages form a link midway between the Gujarati language and the Rajasthani‚ÄìMarwari languages. Pardhi language is a spoken language which is North Bareli dialect of Bhil languages. It is an important language of the community. Apart from Pardhi language they speak Gujarati, Rajasthani, Kanarese, Telugu, Marathi, Marwari, Ahirani languages depending on their location.  Culture  Pardhi culture is very similar to Rajput culture due to their Rajput ancestry. However, their culture is a blend of Gujarati & Rajasthani culture. The marriage procession is of Rajput & Gujarati style. They follow the Shaktism sect of Hinduism and have certain Kuldevis similar to Rajputs. They worship Mauli Mata, Kalika Mata, Saptashrungi Mata, Vadekhan Mata and Khodiyar Mata as their Kuldevis. Dussehra is an important festival. They sacrifice a sheep or a goat to please the Kuldevis which is then distributed among the villagers. Animal sacrifice has been an integral part of Rajput culture since ancient times. However, the method of animal sacrifice is different in Pardhis than in Rajputs. Rajputs use the Jhatka method of sacrifice while the Pardhis use a method similar to Halal method, which is generally associated with Muslims.  Criminal Branding  Pardhis were prolific hunters. They were experts in ancient weaponry like Bows & arrows, swords and hunting traps. This made them highly efficient in guerrilla warfare. They were a nuisance for the British Empire along with other 150 Tribes of India who participated in 1857 revolt. There were numerous other revolts against British by these tribal communities. To keep these tribal communities in check, British Brought the Criminal Tribes Act and branded these tribes as criminals from birth. The criminal branding of the tribe goes back to 1871 after the British passed the \\"Criminal Tribes Act\\". About a hundred and fifty tribes were branded as criminal, and the police were given sweeping powers to arrest them and watch over their movements. T. V. Stephens, a British officer at that time quoted: > \\"... people from time immemorial have been pursuing the caste system defined > job-positions: weaving, carpentry and such were hereditary jobs. So there > must have been hereditary criminals also who pursued their forefathers‚Äô > profession.\\" Volume XII of the 1880 Bombay Presidency Gazette has further comments about the group stating: > \\"They are still fond of hunting and poaching and have not got rid of their > turn for thieving.... The Phase Pardhi [a sub-tribe] is nearly always ragged > and dirty, walking with a sneaking gait.\\" In 1952, the tribe was denotified as \\"criminal\\" and named as a nomadic tribe. However this has not changed the public perception of the tribe, and they continue to be stigmatized and live as outcasts, further aggravating their economic hardships.Bania Arrested for Spying by Dilip D'Souza. Rediff.com, 18 January 2003.Injustice, go away: Phase Pardhis are one of India's denotified tribes but the authorities and society in general continue to think of them as criminals The Hindu, Sunday, 1 June 2003. Another Paradhi tribe called the Gav-Paradhi, settled primarily in the Amravati District Maharashtra, escaped the label of 'criminal tribe' as they were mostly agriculturalists. Discrimination Public pressure often prevents the nomadic community from settling in villages. Nowadays, most of the settled Pardhis do agriculture due to strict imposition on ban on hunting and poaching. The nomads go door to door to sell inexpensive items, handicrafts or food items. Major proportion of the child beggars of Mumbai belong to the Pardhi community. Stigma coupled with the lack of education has essentially crippled the community.

It was a part of the ill-fated offensive of the Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army assault on the Polish-Ukrainian troops defending Kiev after their offensive on Kiev a month earlier, during the Polish-Bolshevik War. The Bolshevik assault started on May 26, with the aim of cutting off the Polish 2nd and 3rd Armies and encircling them in a huge pocket. One of the assaulting divisions of the Cavalry Army, the Soviet 11th Cavalry Division, managed to break the front line between the two Polish armies and assaulted a fortified village of Bystrzyk, defended only by a single infantry company of the Polish 50th Kresy Rifles Regiment. After a short skirmish, the Poles were defeated. As the Cossack cavalry took no prisoners, all 75 Poles were killed, including prisoners and wounded in action. The exact Russian losses are unknown. Shortly after the skirmish, the commander of the Polish 13th Infantry Division, Gen. Franciszek Paulik, dispatched the reserve Polish 40th Infantry Regiment, but it was too late to relieve the defenders of Bystryk and the regiment lacked enough firepower to defeat an entire division. Because of that, the Polish tactical counter-offensive was repelled. The following day, the Russian division expanded the gap, broke through to the other side of the front and managed to drive approximately 15 kilometres towards the rear of the Polish forces. This created a gap in the Polish front and endangered the rear of the Polish 13th division. The commander of the Polish 6th Army, Gen. Wac≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz, ordered a counter-assault group to be created out of all available reserves. The group, commanded by Jerzy Sawicki, was composed of two regiments of his 3rd Cavalry Brigade, as well as two infantry battalions from the 19th Infantry Regiment and two batteries of field artillery. The Polish counter-assault started at 1 o'clock in the night of June 1, 1920. The Poles caught the 11th Cavalry Division by surprise in the village of Staro≈õci≈Ñce. Although the forces of both sides were more or less equal, the surprise was decisive and the Russians sounded a retreat after a short skirmish. After a successful pursuit, the 11th Division was forced back to its original positions from before the offensive started.

It is the second-busiest railway station in Norway, behind Oslo Central Station (Oslo S), from which Nationaltheatret is away. Owned and operated by Bane NOR, Nationaltheatret serves regional services to the Vestfold Line and the Oslo Commuter Rail operated by Vy, intercity services on the S√∏rland Line operated by Go-Ahead Norge, and the Airport Express Train. The station is located below an Oslo Metro station with the same name. At ground level there is transfer to the Oslo Tramway and Ruter buses. Nationaltheatret is along with Holmestrand Station one of two underground mainline railway stations in Norway, and named for the adjacent National Theatre. The station opened as the terminus of Holmenkolbanen's light rail services in 1928. The railway station opened on 1 June 1980 and was upgraded to four tracks in 1999. The older section received a full renovation in 2008. Facilities Main entrance to Nationaltheatret from Rusel√∏kkveien Nationaltheatret is one of two underground mainline railway stations in Norway (the other being Holmestrand Station), located within the Oslo Tunnel on the Drammen Line.Hol√∏s (1990): 178 At ground level, there are three entrances to the station. On the east side of the station, the main entrance is from beneath 7. juni-plassen and Victoria Terrasse, facing Rusel√∏kkveien, and there is also an entrance from Johanne Dybwads plass, which is the site of the National Theatre. From the west, there is an entrance from Henrik Ibsens gate. There is a large, open vestibule near the surface at the entrance to Rusel√∏kkveien. It has high-mounted windows facing south, giving natural lighting. The area features escalators and elevators to the platforms, manned ticket sale, lockers, kiosks and caf√©s. The station is also equipped with ticket machines and features baggage trolleys, washrooms and automated teller machines with an assortment of international currencies available. Parking is available away at Vika, where car rental is also provided. Bicycle parking and taxi stands are located at street level. There are two platforms and four tracks, with the older tracks 1 and 2 serving west-bound trains towards Sk√∏yen and Drammen, while the newer tracks 3 and 4 serve east-bound trains to Oslo S. The platforms are long, respectively, and located below the surface. The station has a capacity for 40,000 passenger per day and is the second-busiest in Norway. Service At ground level, there is a combined tram and bus station, here with SL95 (left) and SL79 (right) trams. Go-Ahead's intercity services along the S√∏rland Line call at Nationaltheatret, up to four times per day per direction. The fastest service to Kristiansand takes 4 hours and 23 minutes and 7 hours and 59 minutes to Stavanger. Vy's regional service along the Vestfold Line also calls at Nationaltheatret, normally with a one- hour headway. Eastwards, these continue past Oslo S and serve the southern part of the Dovre Line until Lillehammer. All eight lines of the Oslo Commuter Rail stop at Nationaltheatret. However, not all services of all line operate west of Oslo S. The Airport Express Train operates direct, high-speed services to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen every 20 minutes, with the journey taking 28 minutes. Located above the railway station, but nonetheless underground, is a metro station, which serves all six lines of the Oslo Metro. The next west- bound station is Majorstuen (formerly Valkyrie plass, but that station exists no more), while the next east-bound station is Stortinget. At ground level, there is transfer to lines 13 and 19 of the Oslo Tramway. The station is located on the Briskeby Line and serves westbound trains heading along the Briskeby and Lilleaker Lines, and eastbound station, via Jernbanetorget, along the Ekeberg Line and the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line. The station also serves Ruter buses 30, 31, 32, 70, 82 and 83. History The entrance to the metro station from Johanne Dybwads plass in 1935 Planning of the extension of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Rusel√∏kkveien.Aspenberg, 1995: 11‚Äì13 The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.Aspenberg, 1995: 17 By the 1930s, Oslo had two main railway stations, Oslo East Station and Oslo West Station. Serving as the terminal station of the Drammen Line, Oslo West Station (Oslo V) was located in Vika, at the heart of the central business district of Oslo. The much larger Oslo East Station (Oslo √ò) served most commuter, regional and intercity trains.Hol√∏s (1990): 102‚Äì103 In 1938, the Station Committee of 1938 was established to look into a possible connection of the Drammen Line to Oslo √ò.Hol√∏s (1990): 103 Led by Axel Grenholm,Hol√∏s (1990): 102 the committee recommended building a branch from the Drammen Line as a tunnel under the city center, allowing all trains would terminate at Oslo √ò. It was proposed that the tunnel would run from Lassons gate west of Oslo V to Fred. Olsens gate, with an intermediate station close to the location of Oslo V.Hol√∏s (1990): 107 One of the original entrances, from Johanne Dybwads plass In 1946, the Planning Office for Oslo Central Station, led by Fin Hvoslef, was established by the government.Hol√∏s (1990): 117 In 1950, they presented a new report, which recommended that a new route for the tunnel be considered, to ease construction and increase safety.Hol√∏s (1990): 121 This was in part based on an engineering report from 1949, which had made the first detailed plans for the line.Hol√∏s (1990): 123 Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was established in 1960 to look at the matter again.Hol√∏s (1990): 128 Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station.Hol√∏s (1990): 130 However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Sk√∏yen, and build a second station at Frogner.Hol√∏s (1990): 133 The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments.Hol√∏s (1990): 135 Construction of the Oslo Tunnel, Oslo Central Station and Nationaltheatret was passed unanimously.Hol√∏s (1990): 139 Another planning office was established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle.Hol√∏s (1990): 143 The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968,Hol√∏s (1990): 157 and construction started in 1971.Hol√∏s (1990): 171 The initial station was entirely blasted in bedrock and consisted of a single platform, long and wide. Adjacent to the bedrock is a layer of construction concrete and above the platforms, there are corrugated steel plates to catch drips and to reduce noise. The section of line past Nationaltheatret was part of a section of the Oslo Tunnel designated Studenterlunden. Of this, was to run with the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro directly above it, resulting in a two-story tunnel.Hol√∏s (1990): 180 However, just east of Nationaltheatret, the two lines diverge, so the metro station is not directly on top of the railway station.Hol√∏s (1990): 159 Eastbound platforms 3 and 4 The tunnel was officially opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications Ronald ByeHol√∏s (1990): 153 and officially taken into use on 1 June.Bjerke (1994): 12 The tunnel, including Nationaltheatret, cost NOK 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK 170 million. At first, the tunnel and Nationaltheatret was used by commuter trains from Lillestr√∏m to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and √Örnes used the tunnel and turned at Sk√∏yen. On 27 May 1989, Oslo V was closed and all traffic started running via Nationaltheatret.Hol√∏s (1990): 156 From 1998, the Airport Express Train would start operating, and more capacity would be needed, both at Nationaltheatret and through the Oslo Tunnel. In 1995, then NSB held an architecture competition to expand the station, which was won by LPO Arkitektur og Design and their design \\"Next To Nothing\\". Construction commenced in October 1997 and consisted of building of new tunnel, a new double platform, a larger vestibule, escalators and artwork. During the work, of rock were blasted and of concrete were poured. The station was decorated with works by Anne Karine Furunes, Terje Roalkvam and Katrine Gi√¶ver. The upgrades cost NOK 920 million and was officially opened by King Harald V on 16 December 1999. The new entrance was designed by Arne Eggen and decorated by Terje Roalkvam. Other art was designed by B√•rd Breivik and Ole Enstad, including reuse of some of the original vestibule art from 1980, including a green marble wall designed by Katrine Gi√¶ver that runs along the hallway leading to the metro station. The new platform was built using typical 1990s materials, such as glass, metal and concrete, contrasting the old platform which was much darker and featured dark terracotta tiles which were popular during the 1970s. In 2008, the old section of Nationaltheatret Station was renovated, including tracks 1 and 2 and the two original entrances. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators which have lighting that changes color, a more powerful fire safety system, improved emergency exits and replacement of cables and baldachin. The upgrade made the old section lighter, and visually similar to the new section, as it was previously painted in dark red. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration performed a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the permanent way past Nationaltheatret. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches and new tracks.

Plot summary The initial stages of the novel are told in the first person, from the narrative voice of a woman who travels to India, to find out more about her step-grandmother, Olivia. She has various letters written by Olivia, and through reading these, and learning from her own experiences in India, she uncovers the truth about Olivia and her life during the British Raj in the 1920s. Through the use of flashbacks the reader experiences the story from Olivia's point of view. We discover that Olivia, although at first glance she seems simply to be a proper Englishwoman, is actually smothered by British social restrictions, and longs for excitement. She meets the Nawab, who instantly charms her, and gradually lets her into his life. Olivia is drawn to the charm and charisma of the Nawab, and he slowly gains control over her, as he does with other characters such as Harry. Harry is portrayed as weak due to his homosexuality and inability to withstand the Indian climate and food. Olivia eventually becomes pregnant with the Nawab's baby, and out of fear decides to abort the child. This causes scandal in the town of Satipur. She then resides in an unnamed town (\\"Town X\\") for her remaining years. The novel ends with the present-day narrator (whose name is not mentioned) also becoming pregnant, deciding to spend her years in Town X, just as Olivia did.

She was a favorite of Emperor Yuan. She was viewed largely positively for her heroism and (presumed) humility, and viewed sympathetically for her death at the hand of her romantic rival Consort Fu. Family background It is not known when Feng Yuan was born. Her father Feng Fengshi (È¶ÆÂ•â‰∏ñ) was a famous general during the reign of Emperor Xuan, and continued to serve in a number of important posts in the imperial government thereafter. She had nine brothers and three sisters. Her brothers Feng Yewang (È¶ÆÈáéÁéã), Feng Jun (È¶ÆÈÄ°), Feng Li (È¶ÆÁ´ã), and Feng Can (È¶ÆÂèÉ) all later became important officials as well. As imperial consort A scene in the Admonitions Scroll depicting Consort Feng (woman at center) defending Emperor Yuan (man at right) from the bear. Consort Fu is depicted on the left, fleeing. Feng Yuan became a consort to Emperor Yuan in 47 BC, the second year of his reign. She quickly became a favorite of his, along with Consort Fu. She bore him a son, Liu Xing (ÂäâËàà), who was later made the Prince of Xindu in 37 BC. While both Consorts Fu and Feng were imperial consorts, an incident occurred that would cause Consort Feng to be greatly praised, at Fu's embarrassment. In 38 BC, while Emperor Yuan was watching a fight between wild animals, accompanied by a number of his concubines (but apparently not by Empress Wang Zhengjun), a wild bear broke loose and tried to get out of the cage. All of the noble men and women present, including Consort Fu, fled the scene. Only Feng stepped toward the wild bear, which was killed at the last moment by imperial guards. When Emperor Yuan asked her why she did so, Consort Feng replied that she had heard that once a bear had caught one person, it would continue attacking just that victim and no one else; because she was afraid that the bear would attack the emperor, she was willing to sacrifice herself. Consort Fu became greatly jealous of the praise that Feng received for this incident. Consort Feng was never recorded in history as having had the same ambition that her rival Consort Fu had at displacing Crown Prince Liu Ao, the son of Empress Wang Zhengjun, with her son. This might have been because her son was younger not only to the crown prince, but also to Consort Fu's son Liu Kang (ÂäâÂ∫∑), or it could have been that she was humbler and less ambitious. During Consort Feng's years as imperial consort, Emperor Yuan considered promoting her brother Yewang to prime minister or similar positions due to his abilities, but each time thought that he would be criticized for an appearance of nepotism, and so never actually promoted Yewang as such. As princess dowager In 33 BC, Emperor Yuan died, and Crown Prince Ao ascended the throne as Emperor Cheng. Prince Xing went to his principality at Xindu, and Consort Feng went with him with the title Princess Dowager. When Prince Xing's principality was moved to Zhongshan (roughly modern Baoding, Hebei) in 23 BC, Prince Dowager Feng was similarly moved with her son. Not much is known about her years in Zhongshan. In 24 BC, Emperor Cheng considered making her brother Yewang commander of the armed forces, replacing his own uncle Wang Feng (ÁéãÈ≥≥), whose autocratic nature he had become resentful of, but he changed his mind after the news was leaked. In retaliation, Wang Feng removed Feng Yewang from his posts. In 9 BC, Emperor Cheng, sonless, appeared to come to the resolution of making either his younger brother Prince Xing or his nephew Prince Liu Xin of Dingtao (Prince Kang's son) his heir. Emperor Cheng became convinced that Prince Xin was more capable, and at the same time, Prince Xin's grandmother, Consort Fu, was endearing herself to Emperor Cheng's wife, Empress Zhao Feiyan, her sister and Emperor Cheng's favorite Consort Zhao Hede, and Emperor Cheng's uncle Wang Gen with lavish gifts, and so the Zhaos and Wang Gen both praised Prince Xin as well. (There was no evidence that Consort Feng carried out similar lobbying effort on behalf of her son.) Emperor Cheng made Prince Xin crown prince in 8 BC. In 7 BC, Emperor Cheng died, and Prince Xin ascended the throne as Emperor Ai. In the same year, Prince Xing also died, and his only son, the two-year-old Prince Jizi, succeeded him as the Prince of Zhongshan. Princess Dowager Feng continued to serve as princess dowager. Death Prince Jizi was born with a heart ailment, which when afflicting him, caused him to have circulation problems, manifesting itself outwardly as having his lips and appendages turn blue. Princess Dowager Feng raised him personally. She also often prayed to the gods. In 6 BC, Emperor Ai, hearing about his cousin's illness, sent imperial physicians along with his attendant Zhang You (ÂºµÁî±) to go to Zhongshan to treat Prince Jizi. This, however, would have dire consequences of Princess Dowager Feng. When the imperial attendant Zhang got to Zhongshan, suddenly, in a rage, left there and returned to the capital Chang'an. Once he did and was ordered to explain his conduct, he made up a false reason that he had discovered that Princess Dowager Feng was using witchcraft to curse Emperor Ai and his grandmother, Consort Fu, who by now carried the title empress dowager. Empress Dowager Fu, still resentful of Princess Dowager Feng from the days when they were romantic rivals, decided to use this opportunity to strike at Princess Dowager Feng. She sent a eunuch, Shi Li (Âè≤Á´ã), to serve as investigator, and Shi tortured a good number of Princess Dowager Feng's relations (including her younger sister Feng Xi (È¶ÆÁøí) and her sister-in-law Junzhi (Âêõ‰πã), one of her younger brothers'wife), some to death, but still could not build a solid case against Princess Dowager Feng. Shi Li decided to show Princess Dowager Feng who was actually behind the investigation, by referring to an incident in which then-Consort Feng defended Emperor Yuan against a bear which had broken loose. Princess Dowager Feng, realizing that Empress Dowager Fu was behind the investigation, went back to her palace and committed suicide. In total, 17 members of the Feng clan died as a result of the investigations. Prince Jizi, then still a toddler, was spared. Before she committed suicide, Princess Dowager Feng reportedly said the following: In 1 BC, after the deaths of Empress Dowager Fu and Emperor Ai, and after Emperor Yuan's wife Grand Empress Dowager Wang had seized power back from Emperor Ai's male favorite (and probable lover) Dong Xian, Princess Dowager Feng's reputation was restored. Later that year, her grandson Prince Jizi would become emperor, although as effectively a young puppet of Grand Empress Dowager Wang's nephew Wang Mang. Wang Mang would eventually murder him in 5 CE and usurp the Han throne in 8.

When the ring is rubbed and pointed at the genitals of any woman in the vicinity, the genitals (\\"discreet jewels\\") begin speaking of their past amorous experiences to the confusion and consternation of their owner. In the book, the Sultan uses the ring in this manner about thirty times‚Äîusually at a dinner or a social meeting; on these occasions, the Sultan is typically visible to the woman. However, since the ring has the additional property of making its owner invisible when required, a few of the sexual experiences recounted are through direct observation with the Sultan making himself invisible and placing his person in the unsuspecting woman's boudoir.

It was fought between the Polish and Russian forces during the Polish-Bolshevik War and was a part of the Polish counter-assault after the ill-fated Russian offensive of May 27. After capturing Kiev in early May, the Polish and Ukrainian forces of 2nd and 3rd Armies were centered on Kiev, along the Dnieper river and a small bridgehead on the eastern side of the river. After the assault of the Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army has been repelled, the Polish commander Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy feared that the Russian forces of the 12th Army might want to assault the bridgehead directly. To prevent this and disrupt the Russian preparations, an assault group was created in Kiev, composed of merely two battalions of infantry from the elite 1st Legions Infantry Regiment. The Polish units were loaded onto river barges in Kiev and shipped to the village of Vytachiv on the other side. In the early morning of June 2, the Poles assaulted the town of Boryspil, where the Soviet 58th Rifle Division was preparing for an assault. Although numerically inferior, the Polish forces managed to take the enemy by surprise and, after a short skirmish, the Russians withdrew eastwards. After capturing the Russian supply dumps, the Poles returned to Kiev. Although the losses on both sides were low, the Polish assault managed to disrupt the preparations of the Yakir's Group for the assault of the bridgehead.

More specifically, it is oxygen deficiency in arterial blood. Hypoxemia has many causes, and often causes hypoxia as the blood is not supplying enough oxygen to the tissues of the body. Definition Hypoxemia refers to the low level of oxygen in blood, and the more general term hypoxia is an abnormally low oxygen content in any tissue or organ, or the body as a whole. Hypoxemia can cause hypoxia (hypoxemic hypoxia), but hypoxia can also occur via other mechanisms, such as anemia. Robert J. Mason, V. Courtney Broaddus, Thomas R. Martin, Talmadge E. King, Dean E. Schraufnagel, John F. Murray and Jay A. Nadel (eds.) (2010) Murray & Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier. . Hypoxemia is usually defined in terms of reduced partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg) in arterial blood, but also in terms of reduced content of oxygen (ml oxygen per dl blood) or percentage saturation of hemoglobin (the oxygen-binding protein within red blood cells) with oxygen, which is either found singly or in combination. Morris, Alan; Kanner, Richard; Crapo, Robert; Gardner, Reed. (1984) Clinical Pulmonary Function Testing. A manual of uniform laboratory procedures, 2nd ed. While there is general agreement that an arterial blood gas measurement which shows that the partial pressure of oxygen is lower than normal constitutes hypoxemia, there is less agreement concerning whether the oxygen content of blood is relevant in determining hypoxemia. This definition would include oxygen carried by hemoglobin. The oxygen content of blood is thus sometimes viewed as a measure of tissue delivery rather than hypoxemia. Just as extreme hypoxia can be called anoxia, extreme hypoxemia can be called anoxemia. Signs and symptoms In an acute context, hypoxemia can cause symptoms such as those in respiratory distress. These include breathlessness, an increased rate of breathing, use of the chest and abdominal muscles to breathe, and lip pursing. Chronic hypoxemia may be compensated or uncompensated. The compensation may cause symptoms to be overlooked initially, however, further disease or a stress such as any increase in oxygen demand may finally unmask the existing hypoxemia. In a compensated state, blood vessels supplying less- ventilated areas of the lung may selectively contract, to redirect the blood to areas of the lungs which are better ventilated. However, in a chronic context, and if the lungs are not well ventilated generally, this mechanism can result in pulmonary hypertension, overloading the right ventricle of the heart and causing cor pulmonale and right sided heart failure. Polycythemia can also occur. In children, chronic hypoxemia may manifest as delayed growth, neurological development and motor development and decreased sleep quality with frequent sleep arousals. Other symptoms of hypoxemia may include cyanosis, digital clubbing, and symptoms that may relate to the cause of the hypoxemia, including cough and hemoptysis. Serious hypoxemia typically occurs when the partial pressure of oxygen in blood is less than 60 mm Hg, the beginning of the steep portion of the oxygen‚Äìhemoglobin dissociation curve, where a small decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen results in a large decrease in the oxygen content of the blood. Lorenzo Del Sorbo, Erica L. Martin, V. Marco Ranieri (2010) \\"Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\\" In: Murray & Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, Robert J. Mason, V. Courtney Broaddus, Thomas R. Martin, Talmadge E. King, Dean E. Schraufnagel, John F. Murray and Jay A. Nadel (eds.) 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier. . Severe hypoxia can lead to respiratory failure Causes Hypoxemia refers to insufficient oxygen in the blood. Thus any cause that influences the rate or volume of air entering the lungs (ventilation) or any cause that influences the transfer of air from the lungs to the blood may cause hypoxemia. As well as these respiratory causes, cardiovascular causes such as shunts may also result in hypoxemia. Hypoxemia is caused by five categories of etiologies: hypoventilation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, right-to-left shunt, diffusion impairment, and low PO2. Low PO2 and hypoventilation are associated with a normal alveolar‚Äìarterial gradient (A-a gradient) whereas the other categories are associated with an increased A-a gradient. =Ventilation= If the alveolar ventilation is low, there will not be enough oxygen delivered to the alveoli for the body's use. This can cause hypoxemia even if the lungs are normal, as the cause is in the brainstem's control of ventilation or in the body's inability to breathe effectively. Respiratory drive Respiration is controlled by centers in the medulla, which influence the rate of breathing and the depth of each breath. This is influenced by the blood level of carbon dioxide, as determined by central and peripheral chemoreceptors located in the central nervous system and carotid and aortic bodies, respectively. Hypoxia occurs when the breathing center doesn't function correctly or when the signal is not appropriate: * Strokes, epilepsy and cervical neck fractures can all damage the medullary respiratory centres that generates rhythmic impulses and transmit them along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm, the muscle that is responsible for breathing. * A decreased respiratory drive can also be the result of metabolic alkalosis, a state of decreased carbon dioxide in the blood * Central sleep apnea. During sleep, the breathing centers of the brain can pause their activity, leading to prolonged periods of apnea with potentially serious consequences. * Hyperventilation followed by prolonged breath-holding. This hyperventilation, attempted by some swimmers, reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the lungs. This reduces the urge to breathe. However, it also means that falling blood oxygen levels are not sensed, and can result in hypoxemia. Physical states A variety of conditions that physically limit airflow can lead to hypoxemia. * Suffocation, including temporary interruption or cessation of breathing as in obstructive sleep apnea, or bedclothes may interfere with breathing in infants, a putative cause of SIDS. * Structural deformities of the chest, such as scoliosis and kyphosis, which can restrict breathing and lead to hypoxia. * Muscle weakness, which may limit the ability of the diaphragm, the primary muscle for drawing new air into lungs, to function. This may be a result of a congenital disease, such as motor neuron disease, or an acquired condition, such as fatigue in severe cases of COPD. Environmental oxygen Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissassociation Curve. In conditions where the proportion of oxygen in the air is low, or when the partial pressure of oxygen has decreased, less oxygen is present in the alveoli of the lungs. The alveolar oxygen is transferred to hemoglobin, a carrier protein inside red blood cells, with an efficiency that decreases with the partial pressure of oxygen in the air. *Altitude. The external partial pressure of oxygen decreases with altitude, for example in areas of high altitude or when flying. This decrease results in decreased carriage of oxygen by hemoglobin. ‚Äì Online interactive oxygen delivery calculator. This is particularly seen as a cause of cerebral hypoxia and mountain sickness in climbers of Mount Everest and other peaks of extreme altitude. For example, at the peak of Mount Everest, the partial pressure of oxygen is just 43 mmHg, whereas at sea level the partial pressure is 150 mmHg. For this reason, cabin pressure in aircraft is maintained at 5,000 to 6,000 feet (1500 to 1800 m). *Diving. Hypoxia in diving can result from sudden surfacing. The partial pressures of gases increases when diving, increases by one ATM every ten metres. This means that a partial pressure of oxygen sufficient to maintain good carriage by hemoglobin is possible at depth, even if it is insufficient at the surface. A diver that remains underwater will slowly consume their oxygen, and when surfacing, the partial pressure of oxygen may be insufficient (shallow water blackout). This may manifest at depth as deep water blackout. *Suffocation. Decreased concentration of oxygen in inspired air caused by reduced replacement of oxygen in the breathing mix. *Anaesthetics. Low partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs when switching from inhaled anesthesia to atmospheric air, due to the Fink effect, or diffusion hypoxia. * Air depleted of oxygen has also proven fatal. In the past, anesthesia machines have malfunctioned, delivering low-oxygen gas mixtures to patients. Additionally, oxygen in a confined space can be consumed if carbon dioxide scrubbers are used without sufficient attention to supplementing the oxygen which has been consumed. =Perfusion= Ventilation-perfusion mismatch This refers to a disruption in the ventilation/perfusion equilibrium. Oxygen entering the lungs typically diffuses across the alveolar- capillary membrane into blood. However this equilibration does not occur when the alveolus is insufficiently ventilated, and as a consequence the blood exiting that alveolus is relatively hypoxemic. When such blood is added to blood from well ventilated alveoli, the mix has a lower oxygen partial pressure than the alveolar air, and so the A-a difference develops. Examples of states that can cause a ventilation-perfusion mismatch include: * Exercise. Whilst modest activity and exercise improves ventilation-perfusion matching, hypoxemia may develop during intense exercise as a result of preexisting lung diseases. During exercise, almost half of the hypoxemia is due to diffusion limitations (again, on average). * Aging. An increasingly poor match between ventilation and perfusion is seen with age, as well as a decreased ability to compensate for hypoxic states. * Disease that affect the pulmonary interstitum can also result in hypoxia, by affecting the ability of oxygen to diffuse into arteries. An example of these diseases is pulmonary fibrosis, where even at rest a fifth of the hypoxemia is due to diffusion limitations (on average). * Diseases that result in acute or chronic respiratory distress can result in hypoxia. These diseases can be acute in onset (such as obstruction by inhaling something or a pulmonary embolus) or chronic (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). * Cirrhosis can be complicated by refractory hypoxemia due to high rates of blood flow through the lung, resulting in ventilation- perfusion mismatch. Shunting Shunting refers to blood that bypasses the pulmonary circulation, meaning that the blood does not receive oxygen from the alveoli. In general, a shunt may be within the heart or lungs, and cannot be corrected by administering oxygen alone. Shunting may occur in normal states: * Anatomic shunting, occurring via the bronchial circulation, which provides blood to the tissues of the lung. Shunting also occurs by the smallest cardiac veins, which empty directly into the left ventricle. * Physiological shunts, occur due to the effect of gravity. The highest concentration of blood in the pulmonary circulation occurs in the bases of the pulmonary tree compared to the highest pressure of gas in the apexes of the lungs. Alveoli may not be ventilated in shallow breathing. Shunting may also occur in disease states: * Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Alveolar collapse, which can increase the amount of physiological shunting, may be managed through a combination of increasing oxygenation as well as positive pressure to recruit collapsed alveoli. * Pathological shunts such as patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, and atrial septal defects or ventricular septal defects. These states are when blood from the right side of the heart moves straight to the left side, without first passing through the lungs. This is known as a right-to-left shunt, which is often congenital in origin. = Exercise = Exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia occurs during exercise when a trained individual exhibits an arterial oxygen saturation below 93%. It occurs in fit, healthy individuals of varying ages and genders. Adaptations due to training include an increased cardiac output from cardiac hypertrophy, improved venous return, and metabolic vasodilation of muscles, and an increased VO2 Max. There must be a corresponding increase in VCO2 thus a necessity to clear the carbon dioxide to prevent a metabolic acidosis. Hypoxemia occurs in these individuals due to increased pulmonary blood flow causing: *Reduced capillary transit time due to an increased blood flow within the pulmonary capillary. Capillary transit time (tc), at rest is around 0.8s, allowing plenty of time for the diffusion of oxygen into the circulation and the diffusion of CO2 out of the circulation. After training, the capillary volume is still the same however cardiac output is increased, resulting in a decreased capillary transit time, reducing to around 0.16s in trained individuals at maximal work rates. This does not give sufficient time for gas diffusion and results in a hypoxemia. *Intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts are dormant capillaries within the lungs that become recruited when venous pressures become too high. They are normally located within deadspace area where gas diffusion does not occur, thus the blood passing through does not become oxygenated resulting in a hypoxemia. Physiology Key to understanding whether the lung is involved in a particular case of hypoxemia is the difference between the alveolar and the arterial oxygen levels; this A-a difference is often called the A-a gradient and is normally small. The arterial oxygen partial pressure is obtained directly from an arterial blood gas determination. The oxygen contained in the alveolar air can be calculated because it will be directly proportional to its fractional composition in air. Since the airways humidify (and so dilute) the inhaled air, the barometric pressure of the atmosphere is reduced by the vapor pressure of water. History The term hypoxemia was originally used to describe low blood oxygen occurring at high altitudes and was defined generally as defective oxygenation of the blood. Henry Power and Leonard W.

Career  Kovalik noticed Pisetsky's potential, and encouraged her to train with Lyubov Serebrianskaya (coach and mother of 1996 Olympic champion Yekaterina Serebrianskaya) at the Gratsia club in Simferopol. Her parents initially opposed the plan, which involved joining a sports boarding school, but accepted due to her grandmother's proximity to the city and ability to visit her often. She gradually developed her body movements and apparatus techniques. For two years, Pisetsky shared a room with Svetlana Rudalova, who later represented Belarus at the Olympics. Pisetsky was a medalist at the Ukrainian Junior Championships. She made her international debut at a 1998 competition in Slovenia and won the event. In 2000, she placed seventh at the Club World Championships in Tokyo. In 2002, Serebrianskaya was sick with cancer and could not coach as actively as before. The Pisetsky family considered immigrating to Belarus or Israel. Despite her coach's objections, Pisetsky's parents decided to move to Tel Aviv, where she had competed once in 1999. She did not immediately continue gymnastics; after six months, she resumed training with Belarusian native Natasha Asmolov at her club in Petach Tikva. Pisetsky won the 2002 Israeli Cup. Her first international competition representing Israel was the 2002 Thiais Grand Prix in France, where she placed 24th in the all-around. She was second at the 2003 Israeli Cup and consequently the second-ranked Israeli gymnast at the European Championship in Granada. At the 2002 European Championships, Pisetsky placed 13th in the all-around, the best result by an Israeli gymnast at the event. She also competed at the 2003 European Championships in Riesa, Germany, which was for individual apparatus only. Her top finishes were 10th place for both the ribbon and the clubs events. Pisetsky initially qualified to the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens by placing 17th at the 2003 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships in Budapest. However, the Israeli Olympic Committee's strict criteria required her to place within the top 10 at an international event before she would be approved to compete in Athens. At the 2004 European championships in her native Ukraine, Pisetsky placed 11th all-around, just missing the cutoff. However, the Israeli Olympic Committee gave her a special exemption and named her to the Olympic team. She said learning she had officially qualified to the Olympics was the second happiest moment of her life, behind only the moment she first stepped off the plane after moving to Israel. In Athens, Pisetsky placed 16th all-around in qualification, missing the cutoff to advance to the final for the top 12. Following the Olympics, she completed her compulsory time serving in the Israeli army. She competed as part of the Israeli group squad at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the group finished seventh in qualification and sixth in the final.

It was located in the Hellenistic regions of Caria and Lydia, which later became the Roman Province of Phrygia Pacatiana. It is now situated near the modern city of Denizli, Turkey. In 2013 the archaeological site was inscribed in the Tentative List of World Heritage Sites in Turkey. It contained one of the Seven churches of Asia mentioned in the Book of Revelation.St. Paul, Ep. ad Coloss. ii. 1, iv. 15, foll.; Apocal. iii. 14, foll. History Columns on the site Ruins of the Lycus Laodicea is situated on the long spur of a hill between the narrow valleys of the small rivers Asopus and Caprus, which discharge their waters into the Lycus. The town was originally called Diospolis, \\"City of Zeus\\", and afterwards Rhodas.Pliny. v. 29. Laodicea, the building of which is ascribed to Antiochus II Theos in 261-253 BC in honor of his wife Laodice, was probably founded on the site of the older town. It was approximately west of Colossae, and south of Hierapolis.Antonine Itinerary p. 337; Tabula Peutingeriana; Strabo xiii. p. 629. It was approximately east of Ephesus and, according to Strabo,14.2.19. it was on a major road. It was in Phrygia, although some ancient authors place Laodicea in differing provincial territories ‚Äì not surprising because the precise limits of these territories were both ill-defined and inconstant; for example, Ptolemyv. 2. ¬ß 18. and PhilostratusLives of the Sophists i. 25 call it a town of Caria, while Stephanus of Byzantium describes it as belonging to Lydia. Western Theatre with Hierapolis‚ÄìPamukkale in the distance Ruins of the Lycus At first, Laodicea was not a place of much importance, but it soon acquired a high degree of prosperity. In 220 BC, Achaeus was its king. In 188 BC, the city passed to the Kingdom of Pergamon, and after 133 BC it fell under Roman control. It suffered greatly during the Mithridatic WarsAppian, Bell. Mithr. 20; Strabo xii. p. 578. but quickly recovered under the dominion of Rome. Towards the end of the Roman Republic and under the first emperors, Laodicea, benefiting from its advantageous position on a trade route, became one of the most important and flourishing commercial cities of Asia Minor, in which large money transactions and an extensive trade in black wool were carried on.Cicero Epistulae ad Familiares ii. 1. 7, iii. 5; Strab. xii.8.16; comp. Vitruvius viii. 3. The area often suffered from earthquakes, especially from the great shock that occurred in the reign of Nero (60 AD) in which the town was completely destroyed. But the inhabitants declined imperial assistance to rebuild the city and restored it from their own means.Tacitus, Annals. xiv. 27. The wealth of its inhabitants created among them a taste for the arts of the Greeks, as is manifest from its ruins, and that it contributed to the advancement of science and literature is attested by the names of the sceptics Antiochus and Theiodas, the successors of AenesidemusDiogenes La√´rtius ix. 11. ¬ß 106, 12. ¬ß 116. and by the existence of a great medical school.Strabo xii. p. 580. Its wealthy citizens embellished Laodicea with beautiful monuments. One of the chief of these citizens, Polemon, became King of Armenian Pontus (called after him \\"Polemoniacus\\") and of the coast round Trebizond. The city minted its own coins, the inscriptions of which show evidence of the worship of Zeus, √Üsculapius, Apollo, and the emperors. It received from Rome the title of free city. During the Roman period, Laodicea was the chief city of a Roman conventus, which comprised twenty-four cities besides itself; Cicero records holding assizes there ca. 50 BC.Cicero ad Fam. iii. 7, ix. 25, xiii. 54, 67, xv. 4, ad Att. v. 15, 16, 20, 21, vi. 1, 2, 3, 7, In Verrem i. 30. Antiochus the Great transported 2,000 Jewish families to Phrygia from Babylonia.Josephus, Ant. Jud., xii.3.4. Many of Laodicea's inhabitants were Jews, and Cicero records that Flaccus confiscated the considerable sum of of gold which was being sent annually to Jerusalem for the Temple (Pro Flacco 28-68).http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/laodicea The martyrdom of Lulianos and Paphos is believed to have happened here. The Byzantine writers often mention Laodicea, especially in the time of the Komnenian emperors. In 1119, Emperor John II Komnenos and his chief military commander, John Axouch, captured Laodicea from the Seljuk Turks in the first major military victory of his reign. It was fortified by the emperor Manuel I Komnenos.Nicet. Chon. Ann. pp. 9, 81. In 1206‚Äì1230, it was ruled by Manuel Maurozomes. The city was destroyed during the invasions of the Turks and Mongols. Christianity at Laodicea The Church of Laodicea Inside the Church Inscriptions on the marble With its large Jewish community,Josephus Ant. Jud. xiv. 10, 20; Hierocl. p. 665. Very early Laodicea became a seat of Christianity and a bishopric. The Epistle to the Colossians mentions Laodicea as one of the communities of concern for Paul the Apostle. It sends greetings from a certain Epaphras from Colossae, who worked hard for the Christians of the three Phrygian cities of Colossae, Laodicea and Hierapolis. Asking for greetings to be sent to the Laodicean Christians, the writer requests that his letter be read publicly at Laodicea (Colossians 4:16) and that another letter addressed to the Laodiceans (see Epistle to the Laodiceans) be given a public reading at Colossae. Some Greek manuscripts of the First Epistle to Timothy end with the words: \\"Written at Laodicea, metropolis of Phrygia Pacatiana\\".Sophrone P√©trid√®s, \\"Laodicea\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) Laodicea is also one of the seven churches of Asia mentioned in the Book of Revelation., The first three bishops attributed to the see of Laodicea are very uncertain, their names recalling people mentioned in the New Testament: Archippus (); Nymphas, already indicated as bishop of Laodicea by the Apostolic Constitutions of the last quarter of the 4th centuryApostolic Constitutions, 7:46 (a man named Nymphas or, according to the best manuscripts, a woman named Nympha is mentioned in ); and Diotrephes (). After these three comes Sagaris, martyr (c. 166). Sisinnius is mentioned in the Acts of the martyr Saint Artemon, a priest of his church. Nunechius assisted at the Council of Nicaea (325). Eugenius, known by an inscription, was probably his successor. The Arian Cecropius was transferred by Constantius to the See of Nicomedia. When Phrygia was divided into two provinces, Laodicea became the metropolis of Phrygia Pacatiana: it figures under this title in all the Notitiae Episcopatuum. Some twenty incumbents are known besides those already enumerated; the last occupied the see in 1450. Since then, the bishopric has become a titular see, listed as Laodicea in Phrygia by the Catholic Church,Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 913 which has appointed no further titular bishops to the see since the transfer of the last incumbent in 1968.Laodicea in Phrygia Sixty canons of a Council of Laodicea, written in Greek, exist. The testimony of Theodoret asserts this assembly was actually held, In Coloss,, ii, 18, Patrologia Latina, LXXXII, 619, the date of this assembly being much discussed. Some have even thought that the council must have preceded that of Nicaea (325), or at least that of Constantinople (381). It seems safer to consider it as subsequent to the latter. The canons are, undoubtedly, only a resume of an older text, and indeed appear to be derived from two distinct collections. They are of great importance in the history of discipline and liturgy; some Protestants have invoked one of them in opposition to the veneration of angels. The ruins Temple \\"A\\" A Roman bridge near the site The existing remains attest to its former greatness. The ruins near Denizli (Denisli) are well preserved and as of 2012 are being substantially renovated. Its many buildings include a stadium, baths, temples, a gymnasium, theatres, and a bouleuterion (Senate House). On the eastern side, the line of the ancient wall may be distinctly traced, with the remains of the Ephesus gate; there are streets traversing the town, flanked by colonnades and numerous pedestals. North of the town, towards the Lycus, are many sarcophagi, with their covers lying near them, partly imbedded in the ground, and all having been long since rifled. West Baths Stadium of Laodicea Particularly interesting are the remains of an aqueduct starting several kilometres away at the Baspinar spring in Denizli, and possibly having another more distant source. Unusually, to cross the valley to the south of Laodicea, instead of the usual open channel carried above the level of the city on lofty arches as was the usual practice of the Romans, an inverted siphon was employed consisting of a double pressurised pipeline, descending into the valley and back up to the city. The low arches supporting the siphon commence near the summit of a low hill to the south where the header tank was located, and thence continue to the first terminal distribution tank (castellum aquae) at the edge of the hill of the city, whose remains are visible to the east of the stadium and South Baths complex. The water was heavily charged with calcareous matter, as several of the arches are covered with a thick encrustation where leaks occurred at later times. The siphon consisted of large carved stone pipes; some of these also are much incrusted, and some completely choked up. The terminal tank has many clay pipes of various diameters for water distribution on the north, east and south sides which, because of the choking by sinter, were replaced in time. To the west of the terminal is a small fountain next to the vaulted gate. The aqueduct appears to have been destroyed by an earthquake, as the remaining arches lean bodily on one side, without being much broken. A second distribution terminal and sedimentation tank is visible north of the first, to which it was connected via another siphon of travertine blocks, and this one is bigger and supplied most of the city. The stadium, which is in a good state of preservation, is near the southern extremity of the city. The seats are arranged along two sides of a narrow valley, which appears to have been taken advantage of for this purpose, and to have been closed up at both ends. Towards the west are considerable remains of a subterranean passage, by which chariots and horses were admitted into the arena, with a long inscription over the entrance. The city ruins bear the stamp of Roman extravagance and luxury, rather than of the stern and massive solidity of the Greeks. Strabo attributes the celebrity of the place to the fertility of the soil and the wealth of some of its inhabitants: amongst whom Hiero, having adorned the city with many beautiful buildings, bequeathed to it more than 2000 talents at his death.Comp. Fellows, Journal written in Asia Minor, p. 280, foll.; William Martin Leake, Asia Minor, p. 251, foll. It was announced in March 2019 that a fairly well-preserved statue of Roman emperor Trajan had been unearthed at the site.

The settlement goes back to 1400 BC.PASTRANA, Alejandro and Patricia Fournier. Cuicuilco. In The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. The Civilizations of Mexico and Central America. Vol. 1. David Carrasco (ed.), pp. 290‚Äì292. New York: Oxford University Press. 2001 Cuicuilco flourished during the Mesoamerican Middle and Late Formative (c. 700 BCE ‚Äì 150 CE) periods. Today, it is a significant archaeological site that was occupied during the Early Formative until its destruction in the Late Formative. Based on its date of occupation, Cuicuilco may be the oldest city in the Valley of Mexico and was roughly contemporary with, and possibly interacting with, the Olmec of the Gulf Coast of lowland Veracruz and Tabasco (also known as the Olmec heartland). Importance Based on known facts, it was the first important civic- religious center of the Mexican Highlands, its population probably including all the social strata and cultural traits that would characterize the alt√©petl (city-state) of classical Mesoamerica. Cuicuilco also represents one of the early sites in Meso America to show state formation. There is evidence of a four tier settlement hierarchy as well as having made investments in architectural projects. It became a rival of the Teotihucan who was also located in the Valley of Mexico. Their interactions were mostly hostile and was personified by both cities taking defensive positions against each other throughout the Valley of Mexico.Spencer, Charles & Redmond, Elsa. (2004). Primary State Formation in Mesoamerica. Annual Review of Anthropology. 33. 173-199. 10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.143823. It was destroyed and abandoned following the eruption of the volcano Xitle, causing migrations and changes to the population and culminating in the consolidation of Teotihuacan as the ruler of the Central Highlands during the Early Classic period. At the site are eight of the many housing and religious buildings that once existed and the remains of a hydraulic system that supplied water to the city. One of the pyramids was built in a strategic position, representing early prehispanic attempts to link religious concepts with cosmic events through building construction. Etymology The etymology is unknown. According to Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History, INAH), American archaeologist and anthropologist Zelia Nuttall (1857‚Äì1933) believed that Cuicuilco means: ‚ÄúPlace where songs and dances are made‚Äù. History Top ring of the main pyramid as seen from stairs leading to top.Cuicuilco was founded as a farming village, but provides evidence of early religious practices, including stone offerings and the use of ceramics as grave goods. The city grew around a large ceremonial center with pyramids and an associated urban area that included plazas and avenues bordering a series of small, shallow pools. These pools were fed by runoff from the nearby hills of Zacayuca and Zacaltepetl. The population at the city's peak is estimated at 20,000 people. The features of the site include terraces, various buildings, fortifications, and irrigation ditches and canals. The main known structure is a pyramidal basement built about 800‚Äì600 BCE. Although this site produced a new ceramic tradition (around 600‚Äì200 BCE), it is considered that the overall site area was developed over several generations of inhabitants. Archaeological evidence, ceramic and structures, indicate that Cuicuilco developed during the first millennium BCE, during the Preclassic, as a small settlement, its inhabitants interacting with other sites in the Basin of Mexico as well as relatively distant regions, e.g. Chupicuaro to the west and Monte Alb√°n southeast. Estimated occupation periods for Cuicuilco may be considered tentative at best. The earliest occupation is estimated in 1200 BCE, and included many farming villages of similar configuration and space distribution. During the period 1000‚Äì800 BCE, conical structures with an oval base were built. Specialists call these sites regional capitals, considering that they had higher hierarchy and functioned as integration centers, eventually becoming larger regional capitals. If the great pyramid of Cuicuilco is an expression of this growth, then this level of development was reached between 800‚Äì600 BC, when it was built. If true, these proto-urban characteristics might have extended into the late Preclassic, with Cuicuilco weakening between 100 BCE and 1 CE, the time when Teotihuacan began to develop, later becoming an important urban center in the Classic period. =Beginning of the Culture= In the mid-Preclassic (c. 800 BCE), settlements emerged in the area, which slowly evolved and grew, becoming cities, subsequently developing into a major civic-ceremonial urban centers in the late Preclassic (c. 100 CE). As an urban center, Cuicuilco became very important, with an advanced and stratified society. Some experts theorize that the development of the site, from its foundation, was due to its strategic location near the pass of Toluca, and near the shores of Lake Texcoco. Under this perspective, although the place produced (around 600‚Äì200 BCE) a new ceramic tradition, is also evident that the region was configured by successive generations. =Culture Growth= Towards the late Preclassic period, around 150 BCE, Cuicuilco became an urban regional center, with a population estimated at about 20,000 inhabitants, comparable with Teotihuacan at that time (cf. Sanders, 1981). Cuicuilco's development was affected by the eruption of the Xitle volcano, which formed a layer of lava that partially or completely covered the city‚Äôs structures, whose extension is inferred to have reached nearly 400 hectares (cf. ibid.). =Physiological characteristics of the culture= The inhabitants had round heads affected by direct or oblique tubular cranial deformation, the first being more common. Dental mutilation was practised. The average life span was 51 years, affected mainly by diseases like osteomyelitis. =Agriculture and food= From their location, inhabitants had access to natural resources, as they were located approximately 4 km from Lake Xochimilco, and near the and Ajusco (cf. Sanders 1981: 173); In addition there were water springs and streams. Prehispanic groups managed to produce food. The economic base was centered on agriculture, probably supplemented by hunting, fishing and gathering; access to wood had to be simple, from nearby forests, and agricultural land in the vicinity of the nuclear portion of the site, buried today under meters of volcanic lava and modern buildings. =End of the culture= The decline began in the early 1st century BCE, with the rise of Teotihuac√°n as a center of cultural and religious influence. By the year 400 CE, the Xitle volcano, located in the vicinity of Ajusco (Nahuatl: atl, xochitl, co, ‚Äúwater‚Äù, ‚Äúflower‚Äù, ‚Äúplace‚Äù; ‚Äúplace of flowers in water‚Äù), and part of the Sierra de Ajusco-Chichinauhtzin, erupted, burying and destroying what still remained of Cuicuilco and Copilco (another important ceremonial center). This disaster led to the dispersion of Cuicuilca culture towards Toluca and Teotihuacan, which hosted a large part of the Cuicuilcas and incorporated many features of their culture. It is considered that the Cuicuilco's decline (100 BCE to 1 CE) had a minor recovery in 1‚Äì150 CE, due to the presence of representations of fire deities. Also, according to some other sources, a series of volcano eruptions and the destruction of Cuicuilco took place in the 1st century BC.Susan Toby Evans, David L. Webster, eds, Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia. Routledge, 2013 p76 In spite of the abandonment of Cuicuilco as an important ceremonial center, people continued making offerings even after the site was covered by lava from the Xitle volcano, which happened around 400 CE or in the range 245 to 315 AD. With Cuicuilco in ruins, Xitle erupted once again, covering much of the city in lava. This lava flow is evident based on excavation around the main pyramid. Excavations show a layer of lava separating the modern surface from the original, ancient surface. This shows much of the city was completely destroyed by the lava flows. This series of eruptions gave rise to Teotihuacan as the center of the Basin of Mexico. From the beginning of the last century, ‚ÄúEl Pedregal‚Äù was an attractive place to define the predecessor cultures of the Teotihuacan y Mexica cultures in the M√©xico basin. Investigations at Cuicuilco B demonstrated that the site's development was as a consequence of internal dynamics. Archaeologists conclude that Cuicuilco was a prominent community prior to the emergence of Teotihuacan as an urban center, noting that the six small communities which some archeologists believe eventually combined to become Teotihuacan were founded and showing evidence of modest growth at the same time that Cuicuilco was building pyramids and public monuments. The city seems to have been abandoned around AD 150 to 200 after the eruption of a nearby volcano, Xitle, although the territory was reoccupied at a much later date. Pottery and other evidence suggest that refugees from the volcanic disaster migrated north and became part of the population pool of Teotihuacan, near the northern shore of the Lake Texcoco. Archaeological site Front part of the pyramid of Cuicuilco Stairway portion of the Cuicuilco pyramid with modern buildings of the Coyoac√°n borough in the background The site of Cuicuilco is covered by a dense volcanic lava field known as the Pedregal de San √Ångel. The lava covers an area of approximately 80 km2, including the foothills of the Ajusco mountain range and extending down to a nearby lake shore. A 1956 study concluded that the uneven lava deposits, reaching a depth over 10 m in areas, were a major factor in the preservation of Cuicuilco. The site is also inside a modern urban area, and is partially covered by buildings associated with the National University of Mexico. Only partial archaeological investigation has been possible, and modern building techniques have damaged the prehistoric city. Several 1990 archaeological finds at Cuicuilco, consisting of a circular pyramid constructed within a plaza with smaller structures associated with the agricultural system, were destroyed for the construction of a multi-storied office complex. Consequently, the true size and complexity of Cuicuilco may be difficult to ascertain. =Other investigations= The prehispanic settlement and its surroundings, upon being covered by lava, were sealed and preserved. Archaeological materials above the lava were affected differently during the last 2000 years. The lava flow sealed off the northern shore of the lake and appears to have created a marshy peat deposit in the eastern section. Multiple layers of volcanic ash from Xitle and possibly from Popocatepetl have been detected in the peat. It has also been suggested that other volcanoes in the area may have played a role. > \\"No geological evidence under the Xitle flow suggests an earlier eruption, > but another monogenetic volcano, Chichinautzin, was also active in the area > prior to Xitle and is believed to have had a similarly large flow and to > have resulted in similar ecological changes.

University of Oklahoma Press, 1997 During Byron Cummings' 1922‚Äì1925 exploration, ceramics were found from phases preceding the eruption. Eduardo Noguera (1939) excavated burials in the proximity of the pyramidal sector known as Cuicuilco A, corresponding to the preclassical archaeological site. In 1957, investigations by Heiser and Bennyhoff provided relevant information to refine the chronological sequence of the main building basement (cf. Sch√°velzon, 1983) Between 1966 and 1968, important complexes of architectural structures were found as well as a series of conical formations, a group called Cuicuilco B, where more than 300,000 ceramic pots were rescued (M√ºller, 1990). Based on analysis of archaeological ceramics of Cuicuilco B, Florence M√ºller determined that the occupation of the settlement continued after the Xitle eruption, during the Classical, Epiclassical, postclassical periods until the Spanish conquest, even though the importance of the site as well as the number of inhabitants dropped radically. In 1990, in the sector known as Cuicuilco C, Rodr√≠guez identified predominant preclassical ceramic materials, as well as, to a lesser extent, pots from later periods, including colonial and modern (Rodriguez, 1994). Stratigraphy has determined that, after the Xitle eruption, materials were deposited on a layer of lava cushions associated with a body of water, which demonstrate the presence of settlements or villages from approximately 200 to 950 CE, according to the preliminary analysis of ceramic layer Features of archaeological materials allow inferring the context of the natural and cultural training processes. Inhabitants discarded vases and fragments in the vicinity of the body of water, and many pots were trapped in the lava, especially domestic pieces such as pans, pots, pitchers, dishes, boxes and comales, even if it does not preclude the possibility that at the end of the life of these vessels, they were simply thrown into the water, considered as trash. On the other hand, the presence of braziers fragments, miniature pieces and Tlaloc vases indicates that these were thrown into the water as offerings as part of rites similar to those recorded by Spanish chroniclers as Sahag√∫n (1989) and Duran (1967) in the twin cities of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco as well as in other settlements in late postclassical Mexico. Many ceramic materials identified in the preliminary analysis correspond to phases of Teotihuac√°n's apogee during the classical period (Tlamimilolpa and Xolalpan phases), between 200 and 650 CE. According to recently adjusted chronology based on radiocarbon dating (cf. Rattray, 1991); predominant types are temporarily located in the epiclassical period, 650-950 CE, Coyotlatelco tradition (cf. Rattray, 1966), and are contemporaneous with the Tula Chico occupation (cf. Cobean, 1990), as well as other important settlements in the Valley of Mexico, as Cerro de la Estrella and Azcapotzalco (altepetl). There are also materials, although in low percentages, whose production and consumption starts in the epiclassical (based recent research made in the Tula region) but have been associated with the Tula apogee. According to ethno- historical sources and some radiocarbon dating, it is located chronologically between 950 and 1150 CE. (cf. Cobean, 1990) These archaeological materials indicate strong social interaction between the Valley of Mexico and other regions under the hegemonic power of Teotihuac√°n, as well as the conformation of sociopolitical units after the decline of said Empire, also as evidence of socio-economic aspects associated with the emergence of the Toltec State. It is a restricted area where deposits were affected by activities of the 20th century, fragments found of Aztec ceramics from the end of the late postclassical, materials of the colonial period (native and Spaniards) as well as 19th-century European fine earthenware. This material provides evidence of a settlement or village in Cuicuilco from the Tepaneca-Aztec empire, before the Spaniards' arrival, continuing the occupation of land owners such as Bernal D√≠az del Castillo and other. Current situation Due to its location, Cuicuilco is in a difficult situation. Among the issues are modern planning and economic interests of the place, as well as disputes on conservation and legislation of the archaeological heritage. Known Cuicuilco is divided into two zones. The first is known as Cuicuilco A, where the ceremonial center is located. The other is called Cuicuilco B and lies West of Cuicuilco A, in the Olympic village Sports Centre. Its importance is recognized by all historians and archaeologists; however it has barely been studied, especially when compared with other archaeological sites, such as Teotihuacan and Tula. The main investigation obstacle is that the area is covered almost entirely with a lava layer of about 9 to 10 meters thick. This difficulty is compounded by urbanization of the area, with constructions directly above the archaeological site, such as the Telmex building and the Cuicuilco commercial Plaza in 1997. The existing Cuicuilco Site Museum is the design of renowned Mexican architect Luis Macgregor Krieger.

Archer (born 1972 in Canton, Ohio) is an American illustrator and creative professional who spent over 18 years at Hasbro, designing for toy brands like Transformers, G.I. Joe, and others. Aaron worked on the Transformers brand for over 13 years, collaborating with Takara on hundreds of toys. Aaron acted as the Creative Lead for all Transformers partnerships including four feature films, four video games, five animated series, theme park rides, and countless publishing projects. In 2013, Aaron retired from Hasbro in order to pursue independent projects. Archer has worked on other Hasbro/Kenner toy lines including various Batman lines, Star Wars and Alien Resurrection, amongst others. Archer's earliest Transformers work were designs for the later Beast Wars toys, including Transmetal 2 Megatron, Dinobot, and Cheetor. Archer was the Design VP on the Transformers brand, a role that essentially made him the highest-ranking creative Transformers staffer on the Hasbro side of the business (Transformers are produced in partnership with Takara). Archer managed a design team that is responsible for concept design, both for larger storyline concepts (Archer claims the idea for the show Transformers: Cybertron was initially created on a Taco Bell napkin over lunch) and for the look of individual characters, while Takara's engineers are responsible for converting Hasbro designs into three-dimensional action figure form. Takara also has say in design choices. Archer is also well known in the Transformers fandom for his brief stint posting on the TFW2005 boards under the assumed name \\"Orson\\" (a reference to Orson Welles, voice of Unicron). Archer responded to fan questions in an unusually cryptic style, answering either-or type questions with a straightforward \\"NO\\" and only answering specific parts of multi-part questions (most likely due to non-disclosure issues). The \\"Orson's World\\" message board was eventually shut down by Hasbro and issued a statement that they wanted to treat all fansites fairly. Hasbro statement Prior to working for Hasbro, Archer self-published a comic book, Gumbo, with Jeff McCormack. Both attended the University of Akron, in Akron, Ohio. Some homages to Aaron include the Transformers movie toy Longarm having \\"Orson's Towing\\" on the door, the early name for Universe Skalor being listed as \\"Archerbot\\", and the Transformers: Animated character \\"Angry Archer\\".

He was ranked the 11th Greatest Comic Book Character by Empire Magazine. In 2011 IGN ranked Jesse Custer 34th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes. Dominic Cooper portrayed the live action version of the character in the television series Preacher. Character history =Early days= Jesse Custer was born on September 19, 1973, son of John Custer, a U.S. Marine from Texas, and Christina L'Angelle, a troubled runaway. The couple met when Christina, encouraged by the Vietnam War-protesting group she was traveling with, spat in the eye of the first soldier she saw returning from overseas. Despite the assault, the two recognized a sense of displacement in each other, and a relationship formed. Quickly, John and Christina fell deeply in love and gave birth to a son, Jesse. During Jesse's early years, his father instilled a love of cowboys and justice in him. Their happiness was short-lived, as Christina's family finally caught up with them with the intention of bringing her home. Psychotic thugs Jody and T.C. were prepared to murder John until they realized he was the father of Christina's son and were obliged to take him along. Jesse was taken back to the family home and introduced to his malicious, intelligent, yet decrepit Grandma, who began to teach him to both love and fear God. John and Christina were married, although John secretly vowed to escape with his family after a suitably safe period of time had passed, but they were caught during the escape attempt, and Jody killed John in front of young Jesse's eyes. After further torment from Jody, Jesse vowed never to cry again. After that, Jesse was stuck with his new family, his only friend Billy-Bob, a one-eyed, inbred swamp-dweller. Gradually his family managed to cruelly take these from him, too. Jesse was educated largely by his mother, while the sadistic Jody taught him mechanics, fighting, and shooting. He was frequently punished by being placed in an airtight coffin and then submerged at the bottom of a river. Jesse's sanity was held intact by the company of a spirit taking the form of cowboy legend John Wayne. Whether this spirit is a genuine manifestation of the Western hero or simply a coping mechanism spawned from his movie-watching history with his father is uncertain. In either case, there's no question that Wayne held him together. By his late teens, the death of his parents and his best friend Billy-Bob gave Jesse the necessary drive to escape the L'Angelle family and run away. =After Angelville= Jesse was a cocky young man, using his skills and good looks to get easy money. Eventually, he ran into a woman who would change his life forever: Tulip O'Hare. The two fell in love and, along with Tulip's friend Amy, pursued a life of crime, stealing expensive cars and never getting caught. The three soon became indebted to a criminal who also stole horses to sell on the meat market. With the help of a former Texas Ranger, Jesse and Tulip freed the horses and defeated the thieves, and Jesse hanged the French meat-dealer for horse-rustling and murdering the ranger, whom Jesse had grown to like and respect (as seen in \\"Preacher: Tall in the Saddle\\"). Jesse and Tulip enjoyed a high life of crime and sex on the highways -- Jesse planned on proposing to Tulip but the sudden reappearance of Jody and T.C. prevented that. Threatening to kill Tulip if he ever spoke to her again, Jesse simply 'disappeared' from her life and was pressed into the clergy by his Grandma. Finally admitting defeat and turning to alcohol, he began practicing as reverend to an ungrateful and ignorant Texas town. Soon enough, the John Wayne spirit that had appeared to Jesse now refused to talk to him. Jesse's desire to point out the hypocrisy of his congregations' lives was finally resolved when he chanced to encounter the comedian Bill Hicks (in either Dallas or Houston, as Jesse was a trifle too drunk to remember properly). Watching the performance of Hicks' cynical, caustic yet utterly truthful wit inspired Jesse to live to a higher standard; when he heard of Hicks' death, he decided to confront his congregation in the local bar, where he pointed out the residents' dirty little secrets. Eventually, Jesse was cut short when he accused a drunk of having raped a hitchhiker. The rapist, whose father had paid off the judge, beat Jesse unconscious with a pool cue. =Finding God= Genesis During a sermon the day after he was attacked in the bar, Jesse was suddenly struck by a supernatural force later identified as Genesis, grafting itself to Jesse's soul and releasing an explosion of energy that destroyed the church and the town, killing the whole population. By a well- timed coincidence, Tulip had hitched a lift with an Irishman named Cassidy after having just bungled her first job as an assassin. The two discovered Jesse among the rubble of the church and, after some discussion, agreed to help him to safety, although Tulip was still furious with Jesse over his sudden abandonment of her five years before. The death of the townsfolk and the rumored appearance of a stone-faced, dual-pistol wielding cowboy brought the involvement of both local law enforcement and the FBI. Through subsequent bloodshed and black humor, the following is revealed: * Merging with Genesis has given Jesse \\"the Word of God\\", a power which forces the listener to obediently follow his commands, so long as the listener can hear and comprehend what is said. This power is signified by Jesse's eyes glowing an eerie red. * The highly charismatic Cassidy, while appearing to be human, is actually a vampire well into his 90s. * The mysterious cowboy is the unstoppable Saint of Killers, sent on a mission from Heaven to find Jesse and subsequently Genesis. * Genesis is the result of a sexual union between an angel and a demon, something not defined by good or evil, and perhaps more powerful than God Himself. It escaped its confinement in Heaven and fled to Earth, finding Jesse. * When Genesis was born, God left Heaven, and no one knows where He went or why. Much of this information was forced from an angel using Jesse's newfound power. Jesse also made a new friend in Cassidy after initially calling him an abomination for drinking blood. Jesse also discovered he was being followed by the Saint of Killers, who was sent to hunt down the mortal who had merged with Genesis. Following these revelations, Jesse decided to use his power to track God down and make Him face up to His own wrongdoings as Creator. Jesse's quest for God would take on the form of an unconventional road trip. He visited many American landmarks, including New York City, Texas, San Francisco, and New Orleans. Family Reunion While on the road, he was once again captured by Jody and T.C., who had almost given up on finding him again. This time, they took Tulip with them, too. Jesse tried to use the Word of God on Jody, but it apparently had no effect on him. Jesse was returned to Grandma, who allowed him one final night with Tulip. Jesse explained to her the events of his childhood, the murder of his father at the hands of Jody, and the real reason why he had to leave her five years before. When morning came, Grandma sent in Jody, who shot Tulip in the head with his handgun. A broken man, Jesse lost all hope. The following day, God visited Tulip's corpse and returned her to life, commanding her to persuade Jesse to give up his quest. Tulip refused, believing God to be using her resurrection as a bribe to get Jesse to end his quest. Meanwhile, John Wayne's spirit slowly convinced the devastated Jesse to fight back against his captors and finally collect on all the pain they had caused him throughout his life. While imprisoned in his room, Jesse tried the Word on T.C. again and was grimly satisfied to see it work. Jesse beat T.C. to a bloody pulp, set fire to Grandma's clan, and battled Jody in a final showdown, eventually breaking his back, strangling him to death and reclaiming his father's Zippo lighter. Tulip shot T.C. dead, and Grandma was killed when the burning house ignited her oxygen tank, sending her rocketing into the sky like a fiery comet. Reunited, Jesse and Tulip shared a passionate kiss, finally free from the demons of Jesse's past. Cassidy & The Grail While helping Cassidy track down the man responsible for giving his junkie girlfriend a large amount of heroin to stash, Jesse met \\"The Grail\\", a sinister organization who have been tasked with finding and capturing Jesse. The secret society was headed by a pope-like figure named Allfather D'Aronique, and his right-hand man, The Sacred Executioner, a German military expert referred to as Herr Starr. While the All-Father wished to capture Jesse in retaliation for the death of his distant aunt (Jesse's grandmother), Starr heard of Jesse's power and planned to use him to bring on Armageddon so they could take over the world. The Grail took Cassidy, believing him to be Jesse, and flew him to a hidden base in France named Masada, where Cassidy maintained the deception. He was found out, and the Grail repeatedly and unsuccessfully, attempted to kill him. Jesse traveled to France to recover Cassidy, believing that they share a bond. He was unwilling to endanger Tulip's life in a rescue attempt, and left her while she slept. Jesse rescued Cassidy, but not without incurring Starr's wrath and inadvertently helping to elevate him to the level of All-Father of the Grail. The Saint of Killers was now after Jesse for information regarding his past that might be locked into Genesis' memories. Cassidy, Jesse, and Tulip were reunited again, but Tulip was angry that Jesse did not trust her to handle herself in a firefight. When Cassidy made a clumsy pass at her, she returned to Jesse's arms and began to distrust the vampire. Jesse realized that his only chance of finding God lay in the memories of Genesis. He traveled to Monument Valley, where he hoped a hallucinogen might hold the key to unlocking them. Starr found him, and used his Grail authority to order a massive military support, eventually deploying a nuclear strike. Attempting to flee the blast in a private jet, Jesse was thrown from the plane after ordering Cassidy not to risk his life saving him. Much to his own surprise, Jesse found himself alive and well in the desert, having miraculously survived the fall but inexplicably missing an eye. Initially, he had no memory of what happened after Cassidy dropped him, and it would not be until later that he remembered: God appeared and explained that He saved Jesse to show that He loves him and that he should abandon his quest. Jesse refused and attempted to use his power; however, God attacked him, biting out his left eye and leaving him a wreck. Before finishing the job, God fled when He detected the Saint of Killers approaching. Though physically ruined, Jesse happily realized that God was afraid of the Saint. Betrayal & Salvation Jesse was found by a hermit in the desert, having lost his memory of his encounter with God. After recuperating for a month, Jesse set off to find Tulip and Cassidy. When he found them, he saw Cassidy embracing Tulip intimately and collapsed in shock. Believing that Tulip had made her peace and moved on, Jesse temporarily put his quest for God on the back burner and found himself in a small town named Salvation. The town was being abused by a local meat industrialist, a diminutive man named Odin Quincannon, and his band of thugs. Jesse was quickly given the position of Sheriff. There, he met Lorie, the sister of his childhood friend, Billy-Bob. Lorie lived with a one-armed woman named Jodie, whom Jesse eventually realized was his mother, Christina, suffering from amnesia from a gunshot wound delivered by Jody years previous. With added help from his female deputy, Cindy, and a German man named Gunther, Jesse fought back at Quincannon's criminal activity, going head-to-head with corporate lawyer Miss Oatlash, an S&M; (sadism and masochism) fanatic who admired Adolf Hitler and secretly desired Jesse. After escaping Oatlash, Jesse confronted the tiny businessman who attempted to blow up the town during a storm, but was struck by lightning before doing so. A defeated man, Quincannon was eventually killed by Jesse in one of his meat storage rooms. During his time in Salvation, Jesse became very close to Cindy, and the possibility of a romance blossomed between the two. However, both of them realized it would never work out, as Jesse was still in love with Tulip. This realization started Jesse on the road to forgiving Tulip, a process he began by setting out to learn what happened between her and Cassidy. Meanwhile, Jesse's mother began a relationship with Gunther. Although Jesse was initially uncomfortable with the idea of his mother having a relationship, he came to like and respect Gunther, who supported him when Jesse needed the town's approval to go against Quincannon. Jesse believed Gunther's tale of having escaped from Germany because he was against the Nazi regime; however, with the help of one of Miss Oatlash's books on Nazi history, Jesse eventually discovered Gunther's story was a lie. When confronted, Gunther broke down and admitted that he was a fully participating SS officer. Although Gunther pleaded with Jesse to understand, believing that he was his chance for redemption, from Jesse's point of view he could not be forgiven for the acts he had committed as a Nazi. Jesse tossed him a rope and walked out, and it is later revealed that Gunther hanged himself without leaving any explanation. Through another well- timed prompt from The Duke's spirit, Jesse realized he was going to get back on the job he set out to do, and to bring the girl he loved to meet his mother. With the help of the hallucinogens he still had from Monument Valley, Jesse recovered his lost memories of his brush with God (and with it, the revelation that God feared the Saint). Furthermore, he came to a conclusion about God's motives. These two facts combined to give Jesse a new strategy for hunting down God. =The End of the Road= Jesse eventually discovered that Tulip had never truly betrayed him to Cassidy, as he had kept her dependent on drugs and alcohol after she thought Jesse had died. Tulip managed to escape the vampire's control, and fled back to her old friend Amy, who delivered the startling news that Jesse was alive and well and was in fact coming to Amy's place to begin his search for Tulip. Jesse and Tulip were reunited for the second time, and Tulip finally revealed Cassidy's true nature to Jesse. Jesse found a homeless woman who was an old acquaintance of Cassidy's and discovered the fullness of his sins, including violence against women, theft, prostitution, murder, and addiction. While disappointed in Cassidy, he was more angry that he had been tricked into thinking that he and Cassidy shared the same code of honor that he so fervently believed in. When Cassidy showed up to reclaim Tulip, he was surprised to find Jesse alive. He grew agitated when confronted with what he'd done, and took a swing at Jesse in anger. Jesse made him leave, agreeing to meet up on a certain date to discuss their grudge. While devising a plan to finally catch up with God and challenge Him, Jesse realized that he would be putting Tulip in danger once more. Ashamed that he still couldn't bear the risk of hurting her, he sedated her and left her in a hotel room while he took care of business, knowing this would be the final betrayal and that she would not forgive him a second time. Jesse met with Cassidy, and they discussed his troubled past. Jesse eventually forced Cassidy to fight him, meaning to show his former friend what it feels like to be as vulnerable as all the women he had abused. The fight was one-sided, as Jesse beat Cassidy to a bloody pulp. Beaten and ashamed, Cassidy asked Jesse for help, saying that if a good man like Jesse can offer him his hand, then that's enough of a reason to believe he has to change his ways. Cassidy asked for Jesse's hand in forgiveness. When Jesse, showing signs of recognizing and being uncomfortable by the similarities, once again turned away, Cassidy accused him of not following his own code, that he wouldn't stand by his friends when they really need it (\\"it's not so easy... when they're stuck on the road to hell, is it?\\"). Jesse realized this was true and offered a hand to Cassidy ‚Äì but it was partially a ruse and Cassidy knocked Jesse out, incapacitating him. Cassidy turned to face the sun as it rose and thanked Jesse for being his friend and offering him his hand. As he died in flames, Jesse was shot by a sniper hiding on a rooftop under order from Herr Starr ‚Äì who had been watching the whole fight with glee. Tulip arrived in time to kill Starr, but not to save Jesse, who had died instantly, covered in the ashes of his best friend. =Alamo= Shot down outside the Alamo, Jesse's death would not be in vain, or, as it turns out, final. Having faced down the Saint of Killers (something no one had successfully done before), he had struck a bargain with him. Jesse's death would separate him from Genesis, the only occasion that would cause God to feel safe in returning to His seat in Heaven, but God wouldn't know the Saint would be waiting with his twin Colts, guns that deliver wounds no less than fatal. When God returned to Heaven, He was shocked to find the entire angelic host slaughtered and the Saint waiting for Him. God was unable to move him, first with His holy wrath, and then with the promise of resurrecting the Saint's family. The Saint then shot and killed God, freeing the world from His corruption. Before his confrontation with Jesse, Cassidy had visited a church and struck a deal of his own, promising God he would hand Jesse over as long as both his own life and Jesse's are spared. Jesse, now resurrected and with his lost eye restored, sought out Tulip, who explained she cannot and will not forgive him for betraying her a second time. On the verge of parting ways forever, Jesse tracked her down on horseback and asked for her to take him back. After seeing tears in his eyes for the first time since his father's death, Tulip accepted love for her and will to change as genuine. The last panels show Cassidy, now human after his deal with God, watching the sunset and talking to himself, or rather out to Jesse, saying that he will try to act like a man. Powers and abilities =Skills and upbringing= After the death of John Custer, Jesse is raised in Angelville by Christina Custer (named after the New Orleans native currently living in Atlanta), along with the corrupted influence of his grandmother and Jody. Along with his Bible lessons, Christina also sought a more scholarly education. After Christina was taken from him, Jesse continued to be raised by his grandmother, but his parents had already become a major influence on his personality and outlook. Jesse also learned how to fight and hunt and shoot, and became proficient in maintaining and fixing machinery, all taught by Jody. Jody's immense fighting ability obviously rubbed off on Jesse, who impressed Starr tremendously after Jesse had taken out some of his elite Grail soldiers and evaded capture in France. His skills allow him to easily beat the superhumanly strong and fast vampire, Cassidy (at least until Cassidy sucker- punches him). Jesse explains that this is because Cassidy has never had to learn how to fight. =The Word of God= Jesse uses the Word of God When his soul merged with the angel-demon entity Genesis, her powers were focused into what Jesse Custer would refer to as \\"The Word of God\\". When he uses the Word, his eyes turn red and his voice changes that sounds like \\"nails scraping against [your] soul\\". Although no one can resist his commands, his victims must be able to understand them. For example, animals would ignore his commands, and a group of attacking French-speaking soldiers were able to resist him. Jesse prefers to keep his Word in reserve, using it only when he has to. However he has used the word for all sorts of situations before, from ordering a Ku Klux Klan member to 'shit himself' to calling in on a radio phone-in show and ordering the guests to tell America what is it they really want, with embarrassing results. =Genesis= Genesis first appears as \\"a comet with the face of an infant\\". After the emergence of Genesis, Jesse is told that she knows the secrets of heaven and hell. It is sometimes a conscious exchange of information, but it also appears in the form of dreams and hallucinations. His \\"imaginary friend\\" John Wayne reappears since Custer became a minister, and for the first time gives Jesse information he could not have known on his own. He would regularly reappear to give Jesse general advice and notably telling him to leave Salvation because he's just treading water. After the death of Jesse, Genesis reemerges, but now has the face of an adult as she has grown within Jesse's soul.

From 1986 to 1996, he was the grand Mufti of Egypt. In 1996, president Hosni Mubarak appointed him as the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, a position he retained until his death in 2010. Early life Tantawy born on 28 October 1928 in the village of Selim ash- Sharqiyah in the municipality of Tama, Sohag in Egypt. He joined the Alexandria Religious Institute in 1944. He graduated from Al-Azhar's faculty of religious studies in 1958 and went on to teach. In 1966, he was awarded a PhD in Hadith and Tafsir, exegesis of the Qur'an. He became a member of the faculty of Ausol Aldeen in 1968 and a member of the faculty of Arabic & Islamic Studies at the Islamic University of Libya in 1972. In 1980 he moved to Saudi Arabia, where he became chief of the Tafsir branch of the Postgraduate studies branch at the Islamic University of Madinah. He returned to Egypt in 1985, when he became Dean of the Faculty of Ausol Aldeen at the prestigious Alexandria Religious Institute. Education He obtained his first degree with honours, his master's degree in education in 1959 and his PhD in 1966. His doctoral thesis was on the children of Israel in the al-Quran and al-Sunnah. Work In 1986, Tantawy was appointed as Grand Mufti of Egypt on his 58th birthday, 28 October 1986. He held this position for almost ten years, until he was appointed Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque and Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar University by the President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, on 27 March 1996. The Al-Azhar Mosque is one of the most influential and important Sunni Muslim institutions. Tantawy completed a seven thousand page exegesis of the Qur'an (Al-tafser al-waset).

In response to a government request for a ruling, Tantawy (then Grand Mufti of Egypt) issued a fatwa that described some forms of financial interest as tolerable- among them, those paid by government bonds and those on ordinary savings accounts. He declared that charging interest on such bank loans was in fact ribh, or just gaining profit, which was allowable. This eventually allowed the development of a mortgage industry. However, his ruling did not issue as an effectual decree. Tantawy's rationale was based on an interpretation of the Islamic sources as banning usury (an extreme and manipulative form of interest-taking) but not any and all comparable forms of gain.Sheikh Mohammed Sayyid Tantawi , Telegraph.co.uk, dated 7:16 pm GMT 11 March 2010No Great Sheiks , Newsweek, dated 12 March 2010Egypt‚Äôs Grand Sheikh Tantawi dies of heart attack, BikyaMasr, dated 10 March 2010 His views on this issue have been very controversial among his fellow Muslim scholars.

He stressed, however, that Islam did not allow the killing of innocent civilians and children but only invaders and aggressors. =Female imams= Tantawy opposed women as Imams in mixed congregations during Friday prayers (Jumu'ah), saying when \\"A woman's body is private. When she leads men in prayer, in this case, it is not proper for them to look at the woman whose body is in front of them.

He had asked the teenage girl to remove her veil saying: \\"The niqab is a tradition, it has no connection with religion.\\" He then instructed the girl never to wear the niqab again and promised to issue a fatwa against its use in schools, saying he was determined to officially ban any person wearing the niqab from entering schools dependent on Al-Azhar University.Egypt purges niqab from schools and colleges , Telegraph.co.uk, dated 5:44 pm BST 5 October 2009Lawmaker wants Tantawi to step down over veil ban , arab news, dated Thursday 8 October 2009 (18 Shawwal 1430) =Jews= In the 1960s Tantawy wrote a 700-page treatise on the children of Israel in the Quran and Sunnah (Jews in the Qur'an and the Traditions), in which he summarized: > \\"[The] Qur'an describes the Jews with their own particular degenerate > characteristics, i.e. killing the prophets of Allah, corrupting His words by > putting them in the wrong places, consuming the people's wealth frivolously, > refusal to distance themselves from the evil they do, and other ugly > characteristics caused by their deep-rooted lasciviousness ... only a > minority of the Jews keep their word. ...

Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror. New York: Vintage Books, 2008. p. 255. =Saudi Arabia= Tantawy believes that Saudi Arabia is the model country for respecting human rights stating in June 2000: \\"Saudi Arabia leads the world in the protection of human rights because it protects them according to the shari'a of God...Everyone knows that Saudi Arabia is the leading country for the application of human rights in Islam in a just and objective fashion, with no aggression and no prejudice.\\" = Sex reassignment surgery = In 1988, Tantawy issued a fatwa regarding the sex reassignment surgery of Egyptian woman Sally Mursi. The statement summary is translated: \\"It is permissible to perform the operation in order to reveal what was hidden of male or female organs. Indeed, it is obligatory to do so on the grounds that it must be considered a treatment, when a trustworthy doctor advises it. It is, however, not permissible to do it at the mere wish to change sex from woman to man, or vice versa.\\" The fatwa has been interpreted both as in favor and also in rejection of sex reassignment operations. Death Tantawy died on the morning of 10 March 2010, at the age of 81, as result of a heart attack during a visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Tantawy died as he was about to board his return flight to Egypt at Riyadh's King Khaled International Airport. His heart attack came just after he fell whilst boarding the plane. Tantawy had just attended the prize-giving ceremony for the King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam. He was officially pronounced dead at the Amir Sultan hospital. Tantawy's death was unexpected and he was described as being in \\"excellent shape and health\\" prior to his trip. Egyptian authorities stated that, at his family's request, he would be buried in Medina in Saudi Arabia, which is also the burial place of Mohammed. His burial at the Jannatul Baqee cemetery took place after funeral prayers were held at the Prophet's Mosque. Tantawy's deputy, Mohamed Wasel, took over his duties until then President Mubarak appointed a replacement, Ahmad at- Tayyeb, as the new rector of Al Azhar.Al-Azhar rejects Wahhabi call to denounce recognition of Shia Islam =Condolences= Condolences were sent to the Egyptian government by several national leaders and scholars.

Ebrahim Moosa, an associate professor of Islamic studies at Duke University stated: \\"Tantawi was not only pro-Western, he was often pro-authority and did his best to satisfy such authority, even if it meant that he had to cut corners with the body of ethical and moral rulings in Islamic teachings\\"...\\"His fatwas were not often carefully argued and scripted. They lacked a granular discussion of complex and controversial issues, and often he would cherry-pick from the tradition without proper justification.\\" Books Amongst his books: * See also * Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah Notes References External links * Al-Azhar Mosque and University (official site) * Niqab Debate in Egypt: Divided Scholars Category:1928 births Category:2010 deaths Category:20th- century imams Category:21st-century imams Category:Al-Azhar University alumni Category:Islamic University of Madinah alumni Category:Egyptian Sunni Muslims Category:Sunni fiqh scholars Category:Grand Imams of al-Azhar Category:Grand Muftis of Egypt Category:People from Sohag Governorate ","title":"Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy"},{"id":"2596931","text":"Perrier is a brand of bottled mineral water.

He photographically documented important architectural works, churches, streets, landmarks, as well as industries and companies in Mexico at the beginning of the 20th century; because of this, his work has not only artistic value but also historical and documental importance. He was the father of painter Frida Kahlo.  Early life and education  Kahlo was born in Pforzheim, Grand Duchy of Baden, German Empire (now in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany), the son of jeweller Jakob Heinrich Kahlo and Henriette Kaufmann. His daughter Frida Kahlo maintained that he was of Hungarian-Jewish descent. A 2005 book, by Gaby Franger and Rainer Huhle, traced Kahlo's genealogy, and stated that \\"despite the legend propagated by Frida,\\" Guillermo did not have Jewish Hungarian roots, but was born to Lutheran parents who \\"came from families accommodated in Frankfurt and Pforzheim.\\" He attended the University of Nuremberg. His father paid him to travel to Mexico in 1891 as he did not get along with his stepmother. In Mexico, Wilhelm adopted the Spanish equivalent of his name \\"Guillermo.\\" In July 1894 he solicited Mexican citizenship.  Career  Palacio Legislativo, 12 June 1912. The image shows work on the building before it was halted as a result of the Mexican Revolution. Kahlo's earliest known photograph is from 1897. His first project with Secretary of Finance Jos√© Yves Limantour was in 1900. Kahlo usually used large glass plates that measured 8in x 10in to 11in x 14in. In 1901 he set up a photographic studio, working for El Mundo Ilustrado and Semanario Ilustrado. He was commissioned by the government to do architectural photographs, probably his best work. He also took photographs of churches with other photographers for a six-volume survey in the 1920s.  Personal life  Kahlo married Mar√≠a Cardena in August, 1893. The night she died giving birth to their third child, he asked Antonio Calder√≥n for his daughter Matilde‚Äôs hand in marriage. After the marriage, Kahlo sent his and Maria‚Äôs daughters away to be raised in a convent. Kahlo and Calder√≥n were the parents of seven children, including the painter Frida Kahlo and Cristina Kahlo. Cristina was the only one who had children. Frida once commented that in her childhood she would sometimes be present when her father suffered from epileptic seizures and would give him aid. Kahlo died on 14 April 1941 in Coyoac√°n, Mexico City. In popular media Kahlo was played by Roger Rees in the 2002 film Frida.

Campbell (born April 8, 1942) is a Republican politician from California. He was a California State Assemblyman from 1996‚Äì2002, Assembly Republican Leader from 2000‚Äì2001, and a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors from 2003‚Äì2013. Early life and education Born in Los Angeles, Campbell grew up in Pico Rivera. Campbell earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from Loyola Marymount University and a Master of Business Administration from the Harvard Business School. Career and politics After initially working as an engineer, Campbell and his wife founded BIMA Corporation, a company that specialized in Taco Bell franchises. In 1996, Campbell was elected to the represent eastern Orange County's 71st District in the State Assembly with 71% of the vote. He was re-elected with 69% of the vote in a three-way race in 1998 and 67% of the vote in a four-way race in 2000. Campbell served as Assembly Republican Leader from 2000 to 2001. During his time in the Assembly, he also served as Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and was a member of the Banking and Finance Committee, the Education Committee, and the Utilities and Commerce Committee. In 2002, Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer won 73% of the vote to replace the term-limited Campbell. Campbell, in turn, won 75% of the vote in the 2003 special election to fill the vacancy on the Board of Supervisors left when Spitzer resigned to become an Assemblyman. Both men suffered criticism for their apparent job swap, which required changing Orange County from a general law county to a charter county to allow an election to fill the supervisorial vacancy under the county charter instead of having then-Governor Gray Davis fill the vacancy by appointment under general law. However, this controversy seemed to have little effect on the election results, as 53% of County voters approved the creation of the charter and 3/4 of the voters supported the two men in their respective districts. Indeed, Campbell was unopposed for re-election to a full four-year term on the Board of Supervisors in 2004. In 2008, he won 80% of the vote in his bid for a second full four- year term. In 2012, Spitzer won 67% of the vote in his bid to return to the Board to replace the term-limited Campbell. Campbell served as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors from January 4, 2005 ‚Äì January 9, 2007 and from January 11, 2011 ‚Äì January 10, 2012. Personal life Campbell and his wife, Mary, have lived in Villa Park for over a quarter of a century. They have three adult sons, Patrick, Chris, and Brian, and five grandchildren.

He has been listed among the top 10 surfers of the century, and was the 1977 World Surfing Champion. Life and career Tomson was born in Durban, South Africa, and is Jewish. As a Jewish athlete, he was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1995. He learned to surf in the beachbreaks in and around Durban under the watchful eye of his father Ernie, and alongside older cousin Michael Tomson and brother Paul Tomson. Tomson attended school in Durban - Clifton Preparatory, Carmel College, and the University of Natal, where he received a Bachelor of Commerce degree majoring in Business Finance. He graduated from Northeastern University with a Master of Science in Leadership with a focus on social change. Tomson went on to dominate amateur surfing competition in South Africa and began venturing over to Hawaii in the late 1960s, courtesy of a bar mitzvah present from his father. It was on one of these trips that an awestruck 14-year-old Tomson witnessed first hand the so-called \\"Biggest Wave Ever Ridden\\" by Californian Greg Noll at MƒÅkaha in 1969. Hawaii's surf proved to be a daunting challenge for Tomson, but he continued to mature and train in South Africa's hollow waves, such as Cave Rock, the Bay Of Plenty, and Jeffrey's Bay. Tomson won 19 major professional surf events, has been listed as one of the 25 most influential surfers of the century and as one of the 10 greatest surfers of all time. During his career he was both the youngest and oldest surfer to win a pro event, and is considered to be one of the architects of professional surfing. = Surfing and the Free Ride generation = In 1975, Tomson was an integral part of the \\"Free Ride\\" generation. Along with Australians Wayne Bartholomew, Mark Richards, Ian Cairns, Peter Townend, and Mark Warren, they rode the infamous waves along Oahu's legendary North Shore with a style, aggression, and raw courage unseen prior to their arrival. Collectively, these surfers changed the face of surfing and were the first to really apply themselves as serious professional surfers. With his good looks, eloquence, and undeniable athleticism, Tomson served by default as the face and voice of this movement and he is still viewed as the prototype blueprint for today's pro surfer, with legions of fans throughout the world. Tomson won the highly coveted International Professional Surfers World Championship in 1977. On a performance level, Tomson completely changed the way the tube section of the wave was ridden, using a unique style of pumping and weaving through and around collapsing sections of the barrel. Even today, his electrifying performances at Off the Wall and Backdoor Pipeline stand the test of time. A memorable quote of his from the period was, \\"Time is expanded inside the tube.\\" A very underrated aspect of Tomson's inventiveness was his in the tube punch throughs where he escaped unscathed from hideous closeout sections over a shallow reef.  In film  Tomson has appeared in many films, including Free Ride, Fantasea, Many Classic Moments, and In God's Hands. Tomson also co- produced an award-winning full-length feature film about the benchmark mid-1970s surfing era called Bustin' Down the Door, which premiered in early 2008. He also wrote and narrated a documentary about Jeffreys Bay called A Pure Line.  Books and digital media  Tomson is the author of the best- selling Surfer's Code ‚Äì 12 Simple lessons for riding through life and the #1 Amazon teen bestseller: The Code - The Power of I Will.Shaun Tomson (2011).

Its members include people working in TV, radio, theatre, the film industry, cinemas, entertainment venues and recreation grounds, including journalists, actors, dancers, sportspeople, cartoonists, photographers, orchestral and opera performers, as well as people working in public relations, advertising, publishing and website production. Creation The Alliance was created in 1992 through the merging of the unions covering actors, journalists and entertainment industry employees: * Actors Equity (AE) * The Australian Journalists Association (AJA) * The Australian Theatrical & Amusement Employees Association (ATAEA) Since amalgamation, the Symphony Orchestra Musicians Association (SOMA) & the NSW Artworkers Union have joined the Alliance, a Professional Sports Branch has been created & the Screen Technicians Association of Australia (STAA) reconstituted itself under the Alliance banner. In 2005 New Zealand Actors Equity (NZAE) affiliated to MEAA.Tyson p.13 note 1  Sections  The MEAA consists of four main sections: * MEDIA - This represents journalists and media staffers who were previously covered by the AJA * EQUITY - Actors Equity is home to Australia's professional performers including screen actors, theatre practitioners and dancers * ECS - (Entertainment Crew & Sport). This consists of all non- performance employees including technicians, venue staff and ushers, and racing/sport staff * MUSICIANS - This comprises the SOMA (Symphony Orchestra Musician Association) and TOMA (Theatre Orchestra Musicians Association) Affiliations The Alliance is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the International Federation of Actors and the International Federation of Journalists. It is a member of the Australian Copyright Council and is represented on all major training bodies catering for its members and State Labor Councils on behalf of its actors and other entertainment industry sections (excluding journalists) and in some states some sections are affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. The Alliance is also a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of more than 70 non-governmental organisations that monitors press freedom and free expression violations worldwide. The union is headed by CEO Paul Murphy who was appointed to the role in 2015. Awards The Alliance is trustee of the Walkley Award for Excellence in Journalism annually divided into individual categories. There are awards for the best entrant in each category, as well as the winner of the \\"Press photographer of the year\\", \\"Journalism Leadership Award\\" and the \\"Gold Walkley\\". A foundation for performer members, the Equity Foundation was established to run professional development programs and a new series of Equity Awards for \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" and \\"Ensemble Casts\\". Events =MEAA and The Hobbit production in New Zealand= In September 2010, NZAE objected to contracts for actors in The Hobbit series planned for filming in New Zealand. MEAA notified the International Federation of Actors, which on 24 September 2010 issued a Do Not Work order for members worldwide. Producer Peter Jackson; and minister Chris Finlayson claimed that New Zealand's Commerce Act 1986 made it illegal for the producers to engage in collective bargaining with NZAE on two grounds: first, that it represented independent contractors; and, second, that it was based outside New Zealand (being part of MEAA). The Screen Production and Development Association alleged that \\"MEAA/Equity has no legal status in New Zealand\\". The independent-contractor assertions were called into question by the 2005 courtcase Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd. A. F. Tyson noted that critics \\"frequently focuse[d] on the MEAA rather than the NZAE\\" On 20 October 2010, a Wellington meeting of NZAE was called off in the face of a protest planned by hundreds of film crew who feared The Hobbit production would relocate to Eastern Europe.; On 26 October Simon Whipp of NZAE was quoted as saying that he would feel no guilt if it relocated. On 29 October the government rushed a bill amendmening the 1986 act through Parliament, overturning the 2005 decision by explicitly declaring all film workers to be independentcontractors. Emails released in December 2010 by way of the Official Information Act showed that Jackson told the Government he did not believe an international actors' boycott would force The Hobbit overseas. The message, sent to the office of Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee on 18 October, contrasts comments the film-maker made earlier in the month. A full list of the e-mails was released in February 2013 by the Ombudsman, at the request of Radio New Zealand and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, despite resistance on the grounds of commercial sensitivity from the New Zealand Government and Wingnut Films.Ombudsman Decision In Hobbit Case Feb 2013 - Full Text See also *List of trade unions References =Sources= * =Citations= External links *Official website *The Walkley Foundation *The Equity Foundation Category:Trade unions in Australia Category:Communications and media organisations based in Australia Category:Trade unions in New Zealand Category:International Federation of Journalists Category:Entertainment industry unions Category:Communications trade unions Category:Trade unions established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in Australia ","title":"Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance"},{"id":"2596996","text":"Hangman Books is a British independent small press founded in 1981 by Billy Childish, who remains its owner and editor.

Sergey Yurievich Sudeikin, also known as Serge Soudeikine (19 March 1882 in Smolensk ‚Äì 12 August 1946 in Nyack, New York), was a Russian artist and set-designer associated with the Ballets Russes and the Metropolitan Opera. Having been banned from the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture for his \\"obscene drawings\\", Sudeikin joined the Mir Iskusstva movement. His close friends included the poet Mikhail Kuzmin and the impresario Serge Diaghilev, at whose invitation he came to Paris in 1906 for the Salon d'Automne Exhibition, where his work was first shown abroad. From 1907 to 1918 he was married to actress Olga Glebova (1885‚Äì1945), one of the famed beauties of St Petersburg and the closest friend of Anna Akhmatova. Glebova-Sudeikina is the principal character and addressee of Akhmatova's longest work, The Poem Without Hero (1940‚Äì65). Sudeikin designed the sets and costumes for Diaghilev's production of La trag√©die de Salom√© by Florent Schmitt in 1913, and assisted in the execution of Nicholas Roerich's designs for Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring the same year. By the time of the October Revolution Sudeikin was among the foremost theatrical designers in Russia. In 1913 he had eloped to Paris with the dancer Vera de Bosset, whom he subsequently married, and who in the 1920s left him to become the mistress and ultimately second wife of Stravinsky. In 1926 he prepared artwork for the 1926 Broadway production of Nikolai Evreinov's The Chief Thing.

Biography Born in 1960 in the town of Gbarnga, Liberia (Bong County) to an ethnic Mandingo Muslim family, Conneh attended St. Martin's Cathedral School from 1966 to 1973. He attended William Tubman Methodist High School where he received his diploma in 1979. He first became active in politics in 1980 when he joined the opposition Progressive People's Party (PPP); this was formed as one of the first legally recognized opposition parties in Liberia in more than 100 years. Ethnic indigenous groups in Liberia, who comprise some 95% of the population in the 21st century, had grown impatient with restrictions and lack of power under governments dominated by the True Whig Party, whose leaders were primarily Americo- Liberians, an ethnic group descended from African-American colonists of the early and mid-19th century. Conneh had been a member of the Progressive Alliance of Liberia (PAL), the PPP's mother organization. He served as a senior party coordinator for the Kokoyah district in Bong County before fleeing to Uganda when the administration of President William Tolbert banned the PPP and arrested some of its leaders. In 1985, after the Tolbert government was overthrown by Samuel Doe, Conneh returned to Liberia in a bid to contest the upcoming legislative election on the ticket of the United People's Party (UPP). The party was later banned by Doe's increasingly autocratic government, allegedly for possessing a 'foreign ideology'. In 1986, Conneh found employment in the Ministry of Finance, working as a revenue agent in Rivercess County. In 1988, he was transferred to Montserrado County, where he remained until the collapse of President Samuel Doe's regime in 1990 after a decade of rule. During the period of civil war in the country, Conneh moved to Guinea. There he founded and served as the managing director of the Damate Corporation, an export and import business entity based in Conakry. The corporation's main activity involved the trading of second-hand cars imported from Europe. In his testimony to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia he claims that he does not know French, the official language of Guinea.https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/37936 After the civil war ended and elections were held, Conneh returned to Liberia to resume his former job as a revenue agent for the Ministry of Finance. Soon after, he quit and returned to car trading in Conakry. This time, Conneh began exporting second- hand cars purchased in Guinea to Liberia. Liberian intelligence officers accused him of smuggling, and he was arrested and moved to a prison cell in Monrovia. His wife, Aisha, appealed to Guinean president Lansana Cont√© to intervene and ask for Conneh's release. She was the daughter of Conte's soothsayer. With his release obtained, Conneh returned to Guinea. In April 1999, several veteran opponents of President Charles Taylor formed a rebel movement known as Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). LURD was to some extent a successor to United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO). Based on a power sharing agreement between Krahn and Mandingo united around a single maxim: Taylor must go. Conneh was appointed chairman of LURD, because of his wife's high-level contacts with the Guinean government. Civil war resumed in Liberia in 1999 after clashes between LURD rebels and government forces. Following the departure of Charles Taylor under international pressure and the setting up of a broad-based transitional government, which represented multiple ethnic groups and political parties, LURD and other rebel groups finally disbanded. Conneh's supporters founded the Progressive Democratic Party (PRODEM) in preparation for upcoming elections, scheduled for 11 October 2005. Conneh was nominated as the party's presidential candidate, but received only 0.56%Elections in Liberia, African Elections Database. of the vote in the election that brought Ellen Sirleaf to power as president.Elections in Liberia, African Elections Database.

It is Amtrak's third-busiest station in Virginia, aside from its all-auto Auto Train station in Lorton. The station is situated in the northeast quadrant of the junction between two railway lines. The Cardinal uses the east-west line, owned by CSX Transportation and contracted by the Buckingham Branch Railroad, while other services use the north-south line that owned and operated by Norfolk Southern Railway. The station is within walking distance of the University of Virginia, which is the major employer in the area.  History  The original Union Station was built in 1885 to jointly serve the Charlottesville and Rapidan Railroad, the Virginia Midland Railway, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Major renovations in 1915 included the construction of a baggage handling facility. Main Street Station in August 1974 When Amtrak took over most intercity passenger rail service in 1971, the Southern Railway opted to continue running the Southern Crescent itself. The Southern Crescent continued to use Union Station, while the James Whitcomb Riley (later the Cardinal) used Main Street Station to the east. Afflicted with rising costs, the Southern Railway relented and turned the Southern Crescent over to Amtrak on February 1, 1979. Amtrak renamed it as the Crescent and made Union Station the Charlottesville stop for the Cardinal as well. For most of the next three decades, the only trains calling at Charlottesville were the Crescent, which arrived northbound during the morning rush and southbound in the evening, and the tri-weekly Cardinal, which arrived westbound at lunchtime and eastbound before the afternoon rush. In 2009, Amtrak extended a Northeast Regional round-trip to Lynchburg (since extended to Roanoke) by way of Charlottesville. Since 1999, the former baggage handling facility is home to the Amtrak ticket office and waiting area. The main facility has been privately developed into the commercial restaurant, Wild Wing Cafe. Plans coincident with the redevelopment to create a transportation hub at Union Station were not realized. Instead, in 2007 Charlottesville completed the Downtown Transit Center one mile across town.Charlottesville Tomorrow, Transportation Matrix . Retrieved November 2, 2007. However, the station does serve as an intermodal transportation nexus, with connecting Thruway motorcoach service to Richmond (operated by James River Transportation) on site, a 200-plus-space parking lot, and access to a full- service Greyhound Lines bus station down the street. Such services allow Charlottesville travelers to reach various airports in the region. The Charlottesville Free Trolley stops just north of the station, and connects Downtown and the University of Virginia. Out of the twenty Virginia stations, Charlottesville is the fourth busiest in the state, and the fourth-busiest in the Southeast, according to the FY2018 ridership. This is mainly due to the large number of passengers traveling between this station and Washington, Baltimore and points north.

Early life and career Fathi Shaqaqi was born to a refugee family of eight children in the slums of a refugee camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. His family was originally from Zarnuqa near Ramlah, where they had lived for nearly five generations and his grandfather had served as the Imam of the local mosque. The Shaqaqi family fled Zarnuqa during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War in fear of Israeli massacres, and were not allowed to return. His mother died when he was fifteen. Fathi Shaqaqi's brother Khalil, after teaching in several universities in the United States, Kuwait and Bahrain, moved after the Oslo Peace Accords to the West Bank and is founding director of the Nablus-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, established in 1993. Most of his early education was at the United Nations school. He attended Bir Zeit University in the West Bank, where he studied physics and mathematics. In 1970‚Äì1974, he taught mathematics at a school for orphans in East Jerusalem. In 1974 he moved to Egypt to study medicine at Mansoura University, specializing in pediatrics. Upon receiving his medical degree in 1981, he worked in a general practice at Augusta Victoria Hospital in Jerusalem. He later opened a medical clinic in Gaza. Leader of Islamic Jihad During his studies at Birzeit University Shaqaqi became an admirer of Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim brotherhood, and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas. While studying medicine in Egypt he was an acquaintance of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, leader of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and Salah Sariya, a Salafi Palestinian executed in 1976 on the charge of having plotted the assassination of President of Egypt Anwar Sadat. He also became a follower of the ideas of Sayyid Qutb and Hassan al-Banna. He also read Marxist literature, including allegedly the entire works of Karl Marx. The teachings of Qutb, who was executed by President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1966 for supposedly plotting an Islamist revolution, convinced Shkaki that the \\"corrupt and secular governments\\" of the Arab world had to be replaced by Islamic societies politically, socially and culturally. Shaqaqi came to believe that the PLO opposition to Israeli occupation was worthless and that only an Islamist organisations could achieve any political and military successes against Israel. By the later 1970s Shaqaqi broke with both the Muslim Brotherhood and secular Palestinian nationalist groups, dismayed that the former spoke too little about Palestine and the latter too little on Islam. Shortly after the Iranian Revolution, Shaqaqi wrote a book \\"Khomeini, The Islamic Solution and the Alternative\\", which praised Ayatollah Khomeini and his approach to an Islamic state. In Shaqaqi's view the Khomeini victory \\"demonstrated that even against an enemy as powerful as the Shah, a jihad of determined militants could overcome all obstacles.\\" The book sold 10,000 copies in two days. It was banned by the Egyptian government and Shaqaqi was arrested. In 1981, along with Abd Al Aziz Awda and five other Palestinian Islamist and Salafi leaders, he founded the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine. The aim of the organization was the establishment of a sovereign, Islamic Palestinian state within the geographic borders of pre-1948 Mandatory Palestine. Completely rejecting the political process, the organization professes that its goals can only be achieved through Islamic Jihad military means. While an adherent of Islamism, Shaqaqi would later state to British journalist Robert Fisk that \\"We are not talking about theology, we are talking about politics and military things,\\" adding that \\"Islam would be the idea we would start with, Palestine the goal to liberate and Jihad would be the way, the method.\\" He described the organization as a \\"crossing-point between nationalist and Islamism\\", and that his intentions were not to establish an Islamic state, but merely to \\"liberate all of Palestine.\\" Fisk was surprised that Shaqaqi neither greeted him with \\"As-salamu alaykum\\" nor quoted the Quran. Speaking about his motives during the Fisk interview, Shaqaqi stated: \\"We are only defending our right to live in our homeland ... We lived in peace with Jews for centuries... I have no problem with Jews ... But I will fight occupation.\\" In an interview with Charles Richards of The Independent in 1992, Shaqaqi stated that his aim was a Palestine from the river to the sea \\"where all religions can live together in one state under Islamic Quranic law.\\" While nominally a Sunni organization, the PIJ has made every effort to play down the basic differences between Shia and Sunni, instead emphasizing the common elements of the entire Islamic nation. Regarding the Palestinian Christians as \\"our partners in history and destiny,\\" Shaqaqi's organization also had Christian members. The PIJ recruited former leaders of other Palestinian organisations such as the PLO. Many were recruited from the predecessor of the PIJ, originally known as the Palestine Liberation Force, which was founded in 1964 by Zaid al-Husseini but suppressed by Israel in 1971. Shaqiqi created a small secretive organization engaged in assassinations, mass shootings, bombings and suicide bombings against the Israeli military. Shaqaqi prohibited targeting innocent civilians, which however did not include Israeli settlers. After his killing all Israelis were deemed legitimate targets. An elitist group, its appeal is mainly among the educated youth. Shaqaqi was arrested in Gaza by Israel in 1983 for publishing the magazine \\"Islamic Vanguard\\", but released the following year. He was rearrested in 1986 and sentenced to four years in prison at Ashkelon and Nafah in the Negev desert. In 1988 he was deported to Southern Lebanon, allegedly at the orders of Yitzhak Rabin. Shaqaqi learned Hebrew while imprisoned in Israel, and kept a Hebrew dictionary on the bookshelf at his office in the Palestinian Yarmouk Camp on the outskirts of Damascus, which was decorated with a model of Al-Aqsa mosque, a lithograph of Hani Abed and framed photographs of suicide bombers Able to speak \\"flawless English,\\" Shaqaqi stated to Fisk that \\"Before I am a politician and the leader of Islamic Jihad, I am a human being and a poet...\\" He was well read in the literature of Shakespeare, Dante, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, E. M. Forster and other Western writers, quoting Hamlet in length during his interview with Fisk. Shortly after his expulsion to Lebanon in 1988, Shaqaqi met Ruhollah Khomeini in Tehran, who pledged financial and military support for his organization. While in Lebanon the PIJ built up a very close relationship with the Shia Islamist group Hezbollah led by Hassan Nasrallah, and received military training from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. In 1990 he settled in Damascus under the protection of President of Syria Hafez al-Assad. As the leader of the PIJ, Shaqaqi masterminded several suicide bombings in Israel. He was a key player in setting up the National Alliance in January 1994, a coalition of eight PLO groups, Islamic Jihad and Hamas rejecting the Oslo process. The PIJ is considered by Israel to be one of the most extreme and violent organisation in its operational methods and commitment to the destruction of Israel. By 1995 it was according to Fisk \\"perhaps the fiercest of all Israel's modern-day enemies.\\" Assassination Shaqaqi was shot six times on 26 October 1995 in front of the Diplomat Hotel in Sliema, Malta by a hit team composed of two Mossad agents from a Bayonet unit that had previously killed Gerald Bull and Atef Bseiso.Yossi Melman, Meir Javedanfar, The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the State of Iran, Basic Books (2007) 2008 p.177.Ronen Bergman The Secret War with Iran: The 30-Year Clandestine Struggle Against the World's Most Dangerous Terrorist Power, Simon & Schuster 2008 p.275.Yossi Melman, 'Mossad, MI6, the CIA and the case of the assassinated scientist,' The Independent, 30 November 2010Ian Lesser, John Arquilla, Bruce Hoffman, David F.

Islamic Jihad sources in Gaza confirmed that Shiqaqi had been traveling from Libya to his home in Damascus and made a stopover in Malta.Leader of Islamic Jihad Reported Killed in Malta Accounts vary in details. In the Telegraph version by Gordon Thomas, two men, Gil and Ran, arrived in Malta on a late-afternoon flight, after receiving new passports provided by fellow agents in Rome and Athens (sayan), and checked into the Diplomat Hotel where Shaqaqi was residing. Another local sayan who owned a car rental agency provided Ran with a Yamaha motorcycle, which he told hotel staff he planned to use for touring the island. At the same time, a freighter from Haifa radioed the Maltese harbour authorities that it had developed engine trouble and would need to anchor off the island for repairs. A team of Mossad communications technicians on board sent the agents instructions through an encrypted radio system in Gil's suitcase. The two kidon then drove up on the motorcycle and pulled up while Shaqaqi was walking along the waterfront and one of them, Gil, shot him six times in the head, a 'kidon signature'. Ronen Bergman writes that Shaqaqi was out shopping, and was shot twice in the forehead and twice in the back of the head, with a pistol fitted with a silencer and a device to catch the spent bullet cartridges, and that the motorbike had been stolen the day before. Mossad Director-General Shabtai Shavit was reportedly on the ship from where he personally directed the operation. The Maltese police were only able to identify Shaqaqi's body three days later. Legacy Shaqaqi left behind a wife and three children, two boys and a girl. He was succeeded as Secretary-General of the PIJ by fellow co- founder Ramadan Shallah. His funeral in Damascus on 1 November 1995 was attended by some 40,000. The assassination of Shaqaqi, who was regarded as a highly charismatic and capable leader, and the subsequent crackdown on the PIJ by Israel and the Palestinian National Authority led to a significant weakening of the organization. Following the Arab Spring the group has enjoyed a revival in its military and political strength with increased Syrian and Iranian support, and in some Gaza precincts, Shaqaqi's picture is more prominent than that of the Hamas prime minister.

It is the world's first 4th Dimension roller coaster and was the final roller coaster conceived and installed by ride manufacturer Arrow Dynamics. The ride is unique in that the trains' seats pitch 360 degrees forwards and in reverse independent of the main chassis. The coaster initially opened to the public on January 12, 2002; numerous malfunctions delayed it from debuting in 2001 as was originally anticipated. On December 2, 2007, the ride closed for its transformation into X¬≤. It was completely repainted, received new third generation trains and featured new special effects including a sound system and a pair of flame throwers. The ride reopened on May 24, 2008, following the upgrades.  History  An overview of the track when the ride was known as X.Although the ride has received mostly rave reviews from enthusiasts and is a huge hit among the general public, X had problems. Due to design flaws, particularly with the trains, the ride's opening was delayed from Summer 2001 until January 2002. In June 2002, the ride closed to modify the trains. In August 2002, the ride reopened and has been running smoothly ever since, except for a train in the summer of 2005. The ride also closed down sometime in mid-August 2006 due to a blown gear box part and reopened on February 3, 2007.One of the new trains during testingOn November 1, 2007, Six Flags Magic Mountain announced a redesign. X closed on December 2, 2007, to be redesigned including new trains with a pneumatic restraint system (an improvement over the original mechanically operated restraints that would frequently jam), a new color scheme of red track and black supports (originally pink track and yellow supports), and an all-new, innovative state-of-the-art visual, audio and sensory effects. In a projected $10 million investment, X reopened on May 24, 2008, as X¬≤.X launches into a new galaxy, becoming X2. Six Flags Retrieved 2007-11-02 Six Flags Magic Mountain hired S&S; Arrow to build new trains for X¬≤. The new trains are lighter to reduce the amount of wear and downtime. X¬≤ also took on a new load/unload method and third train to increase the ride capacity by 50%. Testing of the trains began on March 6, 2008.X is taken to the next dimension with the first test ride of X2 Six Flags Retrieved 2015-011-30 Ride experience The 3,610-foot (1100 m) long layout features two inversions including a skydive, two \\"raven turns\\", one back flip, and a twisting front flip. Each car on the train spins on its own independent axis 360 degrees forward or backward, which is being controlled by the outer rails of the track. Unlike traditional roller coasters, 4th Dimension roller coasters like X¬≤ have four rails. =Layout= After departing from the loading station, the ride makes a 180-degree turn traveling over the queue and onto the lift hill. After ascending , the train enters a short drop and then ascends an additional to a maximum height of . During this lift, riders are facing backwards. The first drop is 215 feet (65.5 m) and is sloped at 88.5 degrees, causing the train to reach a maximum speed of 76 mph (122 km/h) (faster than X, at about 70 mph). During the main drop, the cars are rotated 180 degrees so that riders are facing toward the ground. The train then enters an inside raven loop, where the cars are rotated again halfway through the loop to create a \\"lie-to-fly\\" maneuver; riders transition from laying on their backs facing backward to a flying prone position facing forward. After exiting the loop, the cars rotate backwards 360 degrees simulating a backflip. This is followed by a sweeping fan turn and a half twist \\"fly-to-lie\\" maneuver, in which riders flip forward 180 degrees to return to the original position of laying on their backs. Flame throwing special effects can be seen overhead as the train enters an outside raven loop immediately followed by another half twist. The track levels out and the train enters the final brake run before returning to the station. =Trains= X¬≤ is a unique prototype design in which the seats can rotate forward or backward 360 degrees in a controlled spin. This is achieved by having four rails on the track. The two rails that control the spin of the seats move up and down relative to the main track and spin the seats using a rack and pinion gear mechanism.How X2 Rotates These \\"rotation\\" rails don't support the train. The other two rails are for the weight-bearing wheels, capable of supporting these heavy trains. Weighing 5 tons, each vehicle has a wing-shaped design that spans . Riders sit on the outside of the coaster track in pairs. Four, tall rack gears move up and down following the profile of the seat rotation rails below the vehicle. This gear rotates the seats forwards and backwards throughout the ride. The ride also has an on-board audio soundtrack that features five songs heard throughout the ride: * Harry Connick, Jr. - \\"It Had To Be You\\" (heard as the train exits the station) * Portions of R. Lee Ermey's speech from Full Metal Jacket along with various movie quotes.(heard on the lift hill) * Metallica - \\"Enter Sandman\\" (heard on the lift hill) * Aerosmith - \\"Love in an Elevator\\" (heard right as the train crests the first drop) * Beastie Boys - \\"Sabotage\\" (heard throughout the ride) * Rage Against the Machine - \\"Wake Up\\" (heard after the train hits the final brake run) Similar roller coasters Eejanaika is a similar roller coaster to X¬≤, located in Japan S&S; Arrow opened the second roller coaster of this type, Eejanaika at Fuji-Q Highland in Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi, Japan. Eejanaika has several meanings, but \\"Ain't it great\\" is believed to be the relevant meaning in this situation. This second 4th Dimension coaster is very similar to X¬≤, but differs in height (Eejanaika is tall), and some elements are altered, such as the first 'half-half' element, in which the trains rotate on the track one half turn as the seats also rotate one half turn, has now been replaced with a 'full-full' element, in which the train rotates on the track for one full turn as the seats rotate one full turn. The turn back towards the lift hill on Eejanaika is a true overbanked turn, while on X¬≤ this turn was not.

The character was co-developed by members of the Barbelith online community. Jenny Everywhere was specifically created when her creators could not find any other truly open-source or public domain characters. She is described both as existing in every reality and being able to shift between realities. This gives the character the ability to be inserted into the continuity of any existing or new work, such as various comics and webcomics. The concept may be extended to other media as well. Conception On creating the character, Steven Wintle described her by saying: > She has short, dark hair. She usually wears aviation goggles on top of her > head and a scarf around her neck. Otherwise, she dresses in comfortable > clothes. She is average size and has a good body image. She has loads of > confidence and charisma. She appears to be Asian or Native American. She has > a ready smile. He went on to describe her as \\"if Tintin listened to Le Tigre and joined the Fantastic Four. She's excitable, passionate, attentive, curious, and caring. Like Captain Marvel, she's just a really powerful kid.\\" Jenny's creation was in part inspired by Octobriana. Licensing The creators of the character insist that any work involving her must include the following text: \\"The character of Jenny Everywhere is available for use by anyone, with only one condition: This paragraph must be included in any publication involving Jenny Everywhere, that others might use this property as they wish. All rights reversed.\\" This does not mean everything with Jenny Everywhere is free-use and uncopyrighted, and people may still maintain copyrights on their own unique characters and character styling, story, artwork, and title. The \\"All Rights Reversed\\" portion refers to the character's name, her characteristics, and the idea of the character is uncopyrightable, as Jenny Everywhere \\"belongs to everyone\\". Being that Jenny Everywhere is a free-culture character with no official site or publication, it has been up to the creators of any story involving The Shifter to decide if they want to link to the continuity of other peoples' work or not. For example; in Alex Hernandez's story Soulless Mate, a prominent character is one of Jenny's boyfriends from the My Bloody Valentine story. In another writer's story, this connection may not have happened. =Stories and appearances= Most of the stories for Jenny Everywhere exist strictly as webcomics, and many had a science fiction or superhero theme. In 2003, Nelson Evergreen and Joe Macar√© had made a limited 50-unit self-publication of their stories, Name's Not Down and Damn Fine Hostile Takeover. The character of Jenny Everywhere has not been limited to independent stories, and she has appeared in a number of existing webcomics as cameos and crossovers. Jenny appeared as a presenter for the 2008 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, presenting the category for Outstanding Character Rendering. Several open source spin-off characters exist in the Jenny Everywhere universe, including: *Jimmy Wherever‚Äîalso known as the Shiftee‚Äîa non-powered Canadian male who is Jenny's boyfriend and can jump realities by holding her hand. *Jenny Somewhere, a clone of Jenny who has an imperfect replica of her powers that leaves her imperiled sometimes. *Jenny Anywhere, a woman who can shift in dimensions but not time-travel and is a sometimes rival of Jenny Everywhere. *Jimmy Anytime, a clone of Jimmy Wherever who was originally made to capture Jenny Anywhere but eventually became her boyfriend. *Johnny Everywhere, a devotee of Jenny Everywhere who is sometimes also known as The Shifter. Contests There have been several one-time, single strips as well that have appeared as entries to Strip Fight contests. Strip Fight is a website that hosts bi-monthly contests in which people are invited to create a single comic strip, based on a given theme. Jenny Everywhere has been the subject of two different Strip Fight contests in 2004 and 2007. In 2008, The Shifter Archive and WAGON Webcomic Battle ran a drawing contest on the subject of Jenny Everywhere. Entrants were to compete for one of three official Jenny Everywhere game cards to be used in the WAGON Webcomic Battle Trading Card Game. Third Place was awarded to Zack Holmes, whose card was placed within the Beta Deck. Second Place was awarded to Jacob Burrows, whose card was placed in the Alpha Deck. First place was awarded to Benj Christensen, whose card was deemed a Rare and Promotional Card. These cards have been put into print in November 2008. Critical response After several complete webcomics and the original launch of jennyeverywhere.com, The Shifter received much praise in niche online communities. The character was recognized in the September 2003 issue of the Canadian publication of Exclaim!, which described the character as being \\"born in a colossal explosion of energy like many of her copyrighted cousins, but unlike Superman or the Hulk, she belongs wholly to the people.\\" References External links *Official site mirror on archive.org, from May 2007 *The Barbelith forum thread where Jenny was created *The Late Shift, a comic introduction to \\"The Shifter.\\" *The Shifter Archive Project, a comprehensive archive of Jenny Everywhere appearances Category:Canadian comics Category:Public domain comics Category:2002 comics debuts Category:Webcomic characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002 Category:Comics about women Category:Science fiction comics Category:Superhero comics Category:Canadian comics characters Category:Female characters in comics ","title":"Jenny Everywhere"},{"id":"2597065","text":"Images in Vogue is a Canadian new wave group formed in 1981 in Vancouver. It originally consisted of vocalist Dale Martindale, guitarist Don Gordon (later of Numb), synth players Joe Vizvary and Glen Nelson, bassist Gary Smith, and percussionist Kevin Crompton (better known as cEvin Key). The band's manager was Kim Clarke Champniss, who later became a MuchMusic VJ.\\"Images in Vogue\\". AllMusic. History =1980‚Äì1991: Formation and Canadian popularity= The band released four EPs before their full-length debut, 1985's In the House. Their first notable chart hit was \\"Lust for Love\\", from the 1983 self-titled EP. The EP reached No. 97 on the Canadian albums chart. Gordon left the band in 1984, and was replaced by Ed Shaw. Their debut album, 1985's In the House reached No. 85 on the Canadian albums chart. Their song \\"In the House\\" won the 1986 CASBY Award for Single of the Year, with the band named Group of the Year. Crompton left Images in Vogue in 1986, indicating that the band's \\"new romantic\\" sound was too commercial for his tastes, and concentrated on his side project Skinny Puppy. Crompton was replaced by Derrick Gyles. Nelson also left the same year, and was replaced by Tim Welch. The band considered changing its name to The Spell while recording its 1988 album, but discovered that an Australian band was already using that name. The album ended up titled as The Spell, but the band remained Images in Vogue. That album was not commercially successful, however. By June 1988, Images in Vogue could no longer count on the support of its record label and this, combined with the band's internal conflicts, influenced Gary Smith to leave the band. Images in Vogue's final concert featuring original content was at Toronto's Opera House in November 1991, after which the band unofficially split as members pursued different ventures. =1994: Best of Collection= In 1994 the band released their first compilation album titled, Best of Collection, on SPG Music Ltd. The collection featured their greatest hits, extended versions and an orchestral version of \\"Lust for Love\\". The selections were culled from recordings made between March 1982‚ÄìOctober 1984. =2002‚Äì2010: Live performances, compilation albums and Being Erica= Since breaking up in 1991, the band has continued to release various compilation CDs featuring remixes and live, rare, and unreleased songs; additionally, rare, commercially unreleased tracks are made available for download by the band at its website. Images in Vogue reunited for gigs at Toronto's Opera House in 2002 and at Vancouver's Commodore Ballroom in 2004, and again in Toronto in 2012 as a special guest opening act for Spoons at their 30th anniversary show for their Arias & Symphonies album. The song \\"Lust for Love\\" was featured in a 2009 episode of the Canadian comedy-drama television series, Being Erica. The penultimate episode of the first season, entitled \\"Erica the Vampire Slayer\\", features Erica traveling back in time to 2001 to attend a vampire-themed role play party. Their 2010 compilation album, Prototypes contains demo tracks and alternate recordings. =2017: Incipience vinyl box set= In 2017 the band released a 4 LP coloured vinyl box set, Incipience.

The A2 is a major road in Northern Ireland, a considerable length of which is often referred to the Antrim Coast Road because much of it follows the scenic coastline of County Antrim; other parts of the road follow the coasts in Counties Down and Londonderry. Mainly a single lane in each direction, the road follows most of the coastline of Northern Ireland. It is connected in several places to other major roads. The Causeway Coast Route The road begins in the city of Newry, County Down and heads North-East through the fishing towns of Warrenpoint, Rostrevor and Kilkeel. After Dundrum the road continues via Ardglass to Strangford, where traffic wishing to stick to this route can take the Portaferry - Strangford Ferry to Portaferry. From there it meets the Irish Sea coast of the Ards Peninsula at Cloughey, and follows it through Portavogie, Ballyhalbert, Millisle and Donaghadee to Bangor, County Down, from where it becomes a major dual carriageway leading to Belfast. After its intersection with the M3, it continues through Belfast City Centre's complex one-way system via the Queen's Bridge and Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, past the Custom House and on along Corporation Street, eventually joining York Road. Along this stretch and further out the Shore Road, the main route runs along the line of the M2 and M5, to a point where the M5 ends in Newtownabbey in the northern suburbs of Belfast. After a suburban stretch through Jordanstown, Greenisland, Carrickfergus, Eden and Whitehead, the road enters open countryside on its way to Larne, where the most noteworthy section of the road, the Antrim Coast Road, begins (see below). After winding round the eastern coast from Larne to Cushendall the road continues along the north coast to Ballycastle before travelling along the Giant's Causeway Coast to Portrush and on through Coleraine and Derry to the border with the Republic of Ireland, where it becomes the N13 and proceeds as far as Letterkenny in County Donegal. Another section finishes at Culmore, County Londonderry and Muff, County Donegal. Where it approaches Derry City the A2 is a dual carriageway from City of Derry Airport to The Foyle Bridge, the second longest bridge on the island of Ireland. Antrim Coast Road The Blackcave Tunnel or \\"Black Arch\\" at the start of the Antrim Coast Road at the northern edge of Larne. Waterfoot. It is the pier of a bridge built in 1873 for the Glenariff Iron Ore and Harbour Company as part of Ireland's first gauge railway. The Antrim Coast Road is regarded as one of the great tourist routes of the world. This part of the road has seen a dramatic increase in traffic in recent years (in particular during warmer weather). It runs along the coast for about , from the Black Arch near Larne to the Red Arch near Cushendall, passing through the villages of Ballygalley, Glenarm, Carnlough and Waterfoot. Motorists, cyclists and pedestrians should pay due care and attention as there are currently no cycle lanes and footpaths are infrequent. Early in the 19th century, in the reign of William IV, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland reported that the Glens of Antrim were \\"cut off from any reasonable communication by the badness of roads over mountains and slopes varying from 1 in 6 to 1 in 12\\". The Commissioners conceived a great project to build the Antrim Coast Road to give better access for the inhabitants, open up the Glens for trade, and give a form of unemployment relief.David Orr. Presidential Address to the Institution of Civil Engineers: 'At the Heart of Society', 2007 The Antrim Coast Road was promoted by the Commissioners, but it was their civil engineer, William Bald, who had the vision of building the road along the foot of the cliffs. He did so between 1832 and 1842, supervised by the County Surveyors of the day ‚Äì Thomas Woodhouse (1832‚Äì1836) and Charles Lanyon (1836‚Äì1842). It was a great achievement for its day and made a great difference to the people of the Glens. Before the road was built they sailed across the North Channel to Scotland to trade their goods, because the short sea crossing was easier than travel by land to the nearest market town. William Bald had the vision of building the road along the foot of the cliffs, some of them over high. This was a novel idea, as previous plans had been to build the road some distance inland. But this would have meant steep gradients as the road traversed the valleys of the Glens as they ran down from the Antrim Plateau to the sea. Bald decided to blast the cliff face which then fell down onto the foreshore to form the base for the new road. In his report to the Commissioners Bald stated: > \\"30,0000 cubic yards of rock have been hurled down on the shore almost > entirely by blasting, which has been executed by care and judgement. This > has been greatly assisted by the use of Beckford's Patent Safety fuse, an > invention of the greatest certainty and economy which reduces, in a great > degree, the chance of those accidents to which the operation of the miners > has been particularly liable.\\" The Antrim Coast Road was completed in 1842 at a cost of ¬£37,140 ‚Äì some ¬£12,000 over budget ‚Äì much to the displeasure of the Commissioners. It then remained largely unchanged until the late 1960s. But there were frequent rockfalls because the geology of the Antrim Coast is Ulster White Limestone, greatly faulted and fissured, which bears a considerable overburden of basalt, also weathered and rotten near the surface. In February 1967 there was a major fall of rock onto the road south of Glenarm, and in May 1967 there was another which completely blocked the road. At this point the cliffs are about high so Antrim County Council decided to build a new road on the seaward side of the old one. The Council did the work largely by direct labour and started to acquire the plant and equipment needed for the job. The council opened a quarry and began to build a new embankment, but on the night of 31 October 1968 there was a one in 70-year storm that washed away the part of the causeway that had not yet been protected by rock armour. The work resumed in 1969 and a reinforced concrete sea wall was built, again by direct labour. Altogether 97,000 tonnes of rock armour were placed and the scheme was completed in November 1970, over three years after the road was closed. William Bald was a civil engineer who left a great legacy to the people of the Glens of Antrim, and created one of the finest tourist routes in the World. But despite extensive research no portrait of him can be found. Bald has two memorials. The first is a small plaque on the road just north of Larne. A second memorial was erected in August 2008 in Burntisland by the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Burntisland Heritage Trust.Burntisland Heritage Trust, 2008 Ian Paisley, the long-standing Member of Parliament for North Antrim, called the road \\"one of the most beautiful in the whole of the United Kingdom\\".

Because the name is a compound of the Greek words Œ∫œÅŒπœÑŒÆœÇ, krites (\\"judge\\") and ·ºÑœÅœáœâ, √°rkh≈ç (\\"to rule\\"), its colloquial use has expanded to cover rule by judges in the modern sense as well. To contrast such a rule by (modern) judges with the actual form of the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, judge Albie Sachs coined the term dikastocracy for it, from Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±œÉœÑŒÆœÇ (\\"judge\\"), rejecting the coinage \\"juristocracy\\" for being an admixture of Latin and Greek. Definitions =Contrast to extant system= Sachs and others rejected the idea that the Constitutional Court of South Africa, on which he sat, was a dikastocracy; using the name to denote what they asserted the Court not to be. It was used in a 1996 Court opinion that rejected the \\"horizontal\\" application (between citizens as opposed to \\"vertical\\" application between citizens and the government) of the RSA constitution's Bill of Rights and warned that \\"horizontal\\" application would turn the republic into such a dikastocracy. Others have similarly used this as an inverse definition to denote what they assert their form of government is not. Supreme Court of the United States justice Stanley Forman Reed, the last dissenter to be convinced in the decision on Brown v. Board of Education used kritarchy as the name for the judicial activism that he initially dissented from, asking his clerk (John Fassett) who argued with the direction to write a dissenting opinion whether he (Fassett) favoured a kritarchy. Fassett was unfamiliar with the word, and Reed told him to look it up. Fassett could not find it in several dictionaries, finally locating it in the Oxford English Dictionary. = According to van Notten = This form of rule (in the non-Biblical sense) is the case of Somalia, ruled by judges with the polycentric legal tradition of xeer. The definition employed by Michael van Notten (based upon one by Frank van Dun) is not, strictly, that of rule by judges, judges not being a formal political class but rather people selected at random to perform that task ad hoc; but rather is that of a legal and political system whose closest analogue in other societies is that of a system based entirely upon customary rather than statutory law. Van Notten himself argues that with few exceptions, the system of government which he denotes a kritarchy is \\"harmonious with the concept of natural law\\" and \\"very close to what in philosophy might be called 'the natural order of human beings'\\". Historic examples Ireland had a system of kritarchy from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD under the Brehon Law, the Brehons being the class of Druid Judges.

It is a variant of TPF specially designed to provide all the benefits of TPF (very high speed, high volume, and high availability in transaction processing) but with the advantages such as easier integration into the data center offered by running on a standard IBM operating system platform. Like TPF, it is primarily used in the airline, hotel, and banking industries. Whereas TPF runs as a stand-alone OS, ALCS is designed to run as an application on top of MVS/OS/390/z/OS. However, the API it provides to applications is very similar to that on TPF, so applications written for TPF can run on ALCS with minimal modifications: typically fewer modifications than are required to move from one release of TPF to another. ALCS 2.3.1 runs on OS/390 2.10 and z/OS. ALCS 2.4.1 was released in June 2008. Because it runs under standard IBM operating systems, it can easily leverage other developments or enhancements on those platforms. For example, to enable MQSeries for TPF required the porting, modification, and authoring of large volumes of code. To enable this on ALCS, only an interface to the MQ product on z/OS needed to be written. And any enhancements made to MQ Series on z/OS by the MQ team are available without any additional work on the part of the ALCS development team.

Schuller and Arvella Schuller. He was formerly a minister on the Hour of Power weekly television program broadcast from the Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, California. He appeared on the program almost every week since 1976. He was installed as the senior pastor in January 2006. According to the Hour of Power website, he resigned as senior pastor on November 29, 2008. He continues his ministry with Robert Schuller Ministries. Life and ministry Schuller was born in Blue Island, Illinois and raised in Garden Grove, California until 3rd Grade, when his family moved to Santa Ana where he attended Santa Ana High School. He graduated in 1976 from Hope College in Holland, Michigan, with a bachelor's degree in ancient civilization. He was also employed at the Crystal Cathedral, leading worship services on Sunday evenings, developing a 24-hour prayer group and organizing small group fellowships and appearing on the Hour of Power reading scripture and occasionally preaching. In 1980, Schuller became an ordained minister in the Reformed Church in America, after receiving a Master of Divinity degree from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He received an honorary doctorate degree from National Hispanic University in San Jose, California in 1996. He received another honorary doctorate from the California Graduate School of Theology in 2008. Schuller has four grown children, two granddaughters and two grandsons. He lives in Newport Beach, California. Schuller's first marriage ended in divorce in 1983 and he married his current wife, Donna, on November 10, 1984. In 1981, Schuller founded Rancho Capistrano Community Church in San Juan Capistrano, California, where he served as senior pastor for over 20 years. From 1995 to 2000, Schuller hosted a one-hour live coast to coast radio show. The program revolved around health and wellness and featured a number of guest stars, including Larry King, Robert Atkins, and Elizabeth Dole. On October 25, 2008, his father announced that Schuller had been removed from the Hour of Power television program, citing \\"a lack of shared vision\\". In a prepared statement, founder Robert H. Schuller stated that \\"different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry\\" with his son \\"made it necessary... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry\\". It was subsequently announced on November 29, 2008, that Schuller had resigned from his position as senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. Business Chris Wyatt and Schuller founded Comstar Media Fund, LP in 2008 to develop interactive technologies and purchase media properties during the financial crisis. Within six months, the fund had purchased two nationally distributed cable television networks (American Life and FamilyNet) as well as FamilyNet Radio. Shortly thereafter, the company founded Youtoo Technologies, LLC to continue to invent and patent groundbreaking technologies. In 2011, Comstar Media Fund, LP was rebranded Youtoo Media Fund, LP and the company launched the world‚Äôs first interactive TV network, Youtoo TV. Since 2011, the fund has divested both cable networks and is focused on monetizing the patent portfolio and interactive technologies.

Born in Leslie County, Kentucky, Osborne is known primarily for his collaborations with his brother Sonny Osborne in their band, the Osborne Brothers. Osborne grew up helping his dad stock his granddad's general store and absorbing the songs on the Grand Ole Opry, eventually dropping out of high school to form a band with his brother, Sonny. He was a pioneer in conceiving the now-popular high lead vocal trio concept. He has released many recordings since the 1950s. The Osborne Brothers recordings of \\"Rocky Top\\", and \\"Kentucky\\" were named official state songs of Tennessee and Kentucky, respectively. Osborne was drafted into the U.S. Marine Corps in 1951 and while serving in the Korean War he was wounded in action and received the Purple Heart. \\"Bobby knew nothing about bluegrass music. He was listening to the Grand Ole Opry one night on WSM radio.

He appeared on many shows with his musical hero, Ernest Tubb, playing guitar and singing. Ernest Tubb suggested that Bobby play the mandolin to complement his high tenor voice. He began to play the mandolin and it remained one of his main instruments for the rest of his career. Bobby Osborne penned the song, \\"Windy City\\" for Alison Krauss's LP, \\"Windy City.\\" She was joined by singers Suzanne and Sidney Cox of the Cox Family and performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

It can be light or dark in color, depending on the type of flour used and the addition of coloring agents, and is typically denser than bread made from wheat flour. It is higher in fiber than white bread and is darker in color and stronger in flavor. Rye bread was considered a staple through the Middle Ages. Many different types of rye grain have come from north-central, western, and eastern European countries such as Iceland, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and the Czech Republic and is also a specialty in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. Seeded rye bread is also very common in Germany, seeded with caraway seeds, known in the US as Jewish rye bread. Around 500 AD, the Germanic tribe of Saxons settled in Britain and introduced rye, which was well-suited to its temperate climates. Biochemistry Timelapse of a fresh rye sourdough culture rising over a 10-hour period at roughly While rye and wheat are genetically similar enough to interbreed (resulting in hybrids known as triticale), their biochemistries differ enough that they affect the breadmaking process. The key issue is differing amylases, the enzyme which breaks starch down into sugar. While wheat amylases are generally not heat-stable and thus do not affect stronger wheat gluten that gives wheat bread its structure, rye amylase remains active at substantially higher temperatures. Since rye gluten (secalin) is not particularly strong, rye dough structure is based on complex polysaccharides, including rye starch and pentosans. As a result, amylases in rye flour can break down dough structure, inhibiting it from rising. There are two common solutions: The traditional manner, developed where obtaining wheat was impractical because of marginal growing conditions or supply difficulties, uses dough acidification to impede the function of rye amylases. Lowering dough pH, however, compromises the use of relatively acid-intolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based \\"baker's yeast\\". Instead, the addition of naturally acidic Lactobacillus \\"sourdough\\" cultures lowers bread pH, facilitating the growth of an acid-tolerant yeast strain, and helping gelatinize starches in the dough matrix. The byproduct of this approach is lighter bread. In areas where high-gluten hard wheat is readily available, the need for a complex polyculture of bacteria and yeast can often be reduced or removed by adding a large proportion of hard wheat flour to the rye flour. Its added gluten compensates for amylase activity on the starch in the dough, allowing the bread to retain its structure as it bakes. The \\"deli rye\\" tradition in the United States is based upon this mixing of grains. Use of high-gluten wheat flour also makes multigrain bread possible, like the \\"rye and Indian\\" bread of the American colonies, which combined rye and wheat with cornmeal in one loaf. Rye bread contains phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers.European Food Research And Technology, 2002, Volume 214, Number 1, pages 33-42, Types Pumpernickel bread Pure rye bread contains only rye flour, without any wheat. German-style pumpernickel, a dark, dense, and close- textured loaf, is made from crushed or ground whole rye grains, usually without wheat flour, baked for long periods at a low temperature in a covered tin. Rye and wheat flours are often used to produce a rye bread with a lighter texture, color, and flavor than pumpernickel. \\"Light\\" or \\"dark\\" rye flour can be used to make rye bread; the flour is classified according to the amount of bran left in the flour after milling. Caramel or molasses for coloring and caraway seeds are often added to rye bread. In the United States, bread labeled as \\"rye\\" nearly always contains caraway unless explicitly labeled as \\"unseeded.\\" In Canada (especially Montreal), bread labeled as \\"rye\\" often has no seeds, whereas bread labeled as \\"kimmel\\" is usually rye with caraway seeds. Some unique rye bread recipes include ground spices such as fennel, coriander, aniseed, cardamom, or citrus peel. In addition to caramel and molasses, ingredients such as coffee, cocoa, or toasted bread crumbs are sometimes used for both color and flavor in very dark, bread-like pumpernickel. =Straight= Finnish rye hole-bread, ruisreik√§leip√§ A simple, all-rye bread can be made using a sourdough starter and rye meal; it will not rise as high as wheat bread but will be moister with a substantially longer shelf life. Such bread is often known as \\"black bread\\" (, )Black Bread recipe from master baker Jeffrey Hamelman, roughly in the style of German pumpernickel from their darker color than wheat bread (enhanced by long baking times, creating Maillard reactions in the crumb). The German Vollkornbrot (whole-grain bread) is something of an archetypical example, containing both rye meal and cracked whole rye grains (which are generally soaked overnight before incorporating into the dough). It is used both as a sandwich bread and as an appetizer substrate for such things as smoked fish and caviar. German-style pumpernickel has an even darker color derived from toasted, leftover bread and other agents. Due to the density of the bread, the yeast in the starter is used at least as much for the fermentation character in the bread itself as it is for leavening. Danish rugbr√∏d (rye bread), another archetypical example, is typically made with sourdough, with either straight rye flour or mixed with whole and/or cracked rye kernels. Any bread containing wheat flour is not considered rugbr√∏d, but white bread. A variety of seeds, such as pumpkin, poppy, and caraway, may be added for taste. Rugbr√∏d is a staple lunch food, typically eaten topped with cold or warm fish and meats, cheese, or any other cold cut. As stated above, all-rye bread may have a very long shelf life, measured in months rather than days, and are popular as storage rations for long boat trips and outdoor expeditions. Such bread is usually sliced very thin because of their density, sometimes only a few millimeters thick, and are sometimes sold sliced in this manner. =Multigrain= It is fairly common to combine rye with other grains and seeds. In southern Germany and Switzerland, for example, it is not uncommon to find a variant of Vollkornbrot with sunflower seeds instead of the rye seeds, and some traditional recipes also substitute whole wheat grains for the rye grains.Robertson, Laurel, et al. The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book, 2ed. New York: Random House, 2003, . In the colonial era in North America, particularly in the United States, it became common to mix rye and cornmeal in what was known as \\"rye and Indian\\" or, if wheat flour was added, \\"thirded\\" bread; the resulting bread, though less dense than a whole-rye bread, was still heavier than the more expensive wheat-only breads that later became commonplace. In medieval Europe, a mixed rye and wheat bread known as \\"maslin\\" (or variants of the name) was the bread of the better-off peasants for hundreds of years,Elizabeth David, English Bread and Yeast Cookery, Penguin Books, in contrast to the white manchet bread eaten by the rich, and the horsebread eaten by the poorer peasants, which was made of cheaper grains including oats, barley and pulses. =Flatbreads= Nordic crispbread There are three different types of rye crispbread: yeast-fermented, sourdough-fermented, and crispbread. Most of the crispbread produced in Scandinavia is baked after three to four hours of fermentation. Sourdough crispbreads are used in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, and India. The third type of crispbread is the so-called cold bread crispbread, essentially a type of hardtack (known in Sweden particularly as kn√§ckebr√∂d and in Finland as n√§kkileip√§), which is baked without the addition of any leavening.√Ökerstr√∂m, Jenny, and Gudrun Carlson (trans.), The Princesses Cook Book. New York: Albert Bonnier Publishing, 1936. The dough gets the right texture from a foaming process, where air is incorporated into the cooled dough, which also leads to the sometimes almost white color of the finished bread, although not all types are light in color. Crispbread owes its long shelf life to its very low water content (5‚Äì7%). One of the largest producers of rye flatbreads, and one of the most prominent in overseas markets, is the Swedish-founded company Wasabr√∂d. =Quick breads= Rye flour is sometimes used in chemically leavened quick bread recipes as well, either batter-type or dough-type (similar to Irish soda bread). In such cases, it can be used in similar applications as whole wheat flour, since an egg matrix often provides the bread structure rather than the grain's gluten. =Jewish rye bread= America Wheat-rye bread, including light rye (), American pumpernickel, and the combination of the two as marbled rye, is closely associated with Jewish cuisine and Jewish-American cuisine, particularly the delicatessen. The bulk of the flour is white wheat flour (often a less-refined form known as first clear), with a substantial portion of rye mixed in for color and flavor. The dough is often leavened, in whole or in part, with sourdough, but sometimes uses a small addition of citric acid or vinegar to achieve the lowered pH needed to neutralize the rye amylases. The so-called Jewish rye is further seasoned with whole caraway seeds and glazed with an egg wash, and is traditionally associated with salted meats such as corned beef and pastrami. High-gluten wheat flour can be used with rye flour to make a dough suitable for bagels. Jewish-style American rye bread is sometimes referred to as corn rye, possibly from the Yiddish ('grain'), or from the use of cornmeal as a coating and handling aid. [Via ] The Jewish-American variety has Eastern European Jewish antecedents, including Russian Jewish style brown bread, Polish Jewish style rye bread and Latvian Jewish style rye bread.Von Bremzen, Anya, and John Welchmann, Please to the Table. New York: Workman Publishing, 1990, . Scandinavian Jewish In Scandinavia, similar bread is made, due to the large Jewish community, some of which (in Swedish, called V√∂rtlimpa) also include sweeteners and/or citrus peel, as well as spices such as anise, fennel or cardamom, sometimes reserved for festive occasions. Israel In Israel, rye bread is very popular due to the large population of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. It is popular with Israelis of Middle Eastern and North African Jewish descent (Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews) as well. Rye bread is the most common type of packaged bread in Israel, and it is used across the nation in school cafeterias, military bases, prisons, and other government facilities. It is also commonly used in restaurant kitchens and is a staple at many bakeries. It can be found in virtually every bakery and grocery store in Israel. It is commonly mass-produced, and the mass-produced version is very similar to the American mass-produced version, however, it is often very soft. Many bakeries in restaurants in places such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are redefining rye bread and are baking their own versions that are sometimes a twist on the traditional Jewish rye bread, and sometimes harken back to the most traditional Ashkenazi style rye bread. Canada In Canada, there are several different types of Jewish rye bread available in the country. There are mass-produced, prepackaged brands such as Oroweat. In communities with significant Jewish populations such as Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver, authentic Ashkenazi Jewish style rye bread is available at many kosher and kosher-style bakeries, delis, restaurants, and kosher grocery stores. There is also Winnipeg-style rye bread which does not actually contain much, if any, rye flour. Instead, this Jewish-influenced bread is made from cracked rye or coarse rye meal, added to wheat flour. Winnipeg-style rye bread does not contain caraway seeds. Health benefits Rye bread contains a large amount of fiber and a small amount of fat. Compared to some breads such as white bread, rye bread has a lower glycemic index, which means it causes a slower increase in blood sugar than white bread after being eaten. Nonetheless, it consists mostly of carbohydrates, making its glycemic load high.

The name comes from the French word for \\"walk\\", and is a good basic description of the dance action. Dance position and handholds When executing the move, partners stand side-by-side in a promenade position, and act as a single unit. Customarily the man (or gent) stands to the left of the lady, his right hip touching or almost touching her left hip. Note that this promenade position is not the same as that promenade position defined in ballroom dances. They might take any of a number of different promenade handholds. These are generally determined by the specific dance or local dance traditions. Some of these different handholds are: * Basic promenade or Skirt Skater's handhold: The lady extends her left hand horizontally, palm down, across the front of the gent, and he takes it in his left hand. The lady places her right hand at the right side of her waist or slightly behind her right hip, and the gent holds this hand loosely with his right hand. The lady might also use her right hand to hold on to a full skirt with petticoats, sway the skirt in time to the music as a flourish (\\"skirtwork\\"), or simply place her hand on her waist. In this case, the gent places his right hand on the small of her back. * Skater's handhold: Both hands are held in front of the partners at waist-level. The left hands are held in front of the gent's waist; the right hands are held in front of the lady's waist. The gent's right arm crosses in front of the lady's left arm. * Varsouvienne handhold (also called Shadow, Horseshoe, Cape Position): The man holds the woman's left hand with his left hand in front of her left shoulder. The man crosses his right arm behind the woman and holds her right hand with his right hand in front of the woman's right shoulder. The man's arm is held just above the woman's shoulder. * Cuddle, (also called Wrap Position or Sweetheart's Wrap): The gent wraps his right arm around the lady's waist; she wraps her left arm around her front to hold his right hand. She wraps her right arm over her left arm and across her front to hold his left hand. Hands are at waist level. The promenade in contra dance In contra dancing, promenades are used to move a couple to the opposite side of the set. The gent may choose to spin the lady under his arm at the end as a flourish. The promenade in modern Western square dance In square dancing, and in particular modern Western square dance, when a promenade is called it is understood to be a \\"couples promenade\\" involving all four couples. The couples assume a promenade position, each turn to the right as a unit, and walk counter-clockwise around the ring. If not specified how far to walk, they walk to the gent's home position, and then each couples turn as a unit to face into the center of the set. If close to home (¬º of the way or less), couples promenade a complete tour of the ring. The caller can also specifically say \\"promenade home\\" or \\"promenade all the way\\" (or other variations on the wording) with the same result. The gent might twirl the lady under his arm at the end of the move as a flourish. If the partners are ¬º of the ring or less away from his home position, then they promenade a full circle around to get back to his home. The caller may fractionalize the call by specifically requiring the dancers to promenade only ¬º, ¬Ω, or ¬æ of the way around the ring. The caller may also designate a specific couple or specific couples to promenade. The caller may also require the dancers to continue promenading without stopping at the home position, by calling something like \\"promenade ‚Äì Don't stop or slow-down\\". This will be a lead-in to a new call, whereas a \\"promenade home\\" is considered the end of a square dance sequence in most cases. =Other calls in the promenade family of calls= There is one other call in the promenade family as defined by Callerlab, the largest international association of square dance callers. * Single promenade: Dancers individually turn to the right, and promenade single-file around the ring. This type of promenade is also referred to as Indian-style. In addition to all eight individuals promenading single-file, variations of this call include requiring only specific individuals to do the call (boys only, girls only, etc.), and designating whether the specific individuals should promenade inside the ring or outside the ring. =Variations on the promenade= The caller may require the dancers to travel clockwise around the ring by calling a wrong way promenade (as couples) or single wrong way promenade (as individuals). A scatter promenade is a gimmick call where all the couples on the dance floor promenade randomly, until they are typically instructed to make either a group of four with another, usually closest, couple or a group of eight with three other nearby couples. This functions as a social mixer forcing dancers to form new squares. A star promenade is an entirely different call but nevertheless part of the family. It consists of four dancers in the center of the set making a star configuration, with their centermost arms up like the spokes of a wheel, or the ribbons of a maypole. They walk forward counter-clockwise. Their outermost arms are wrapped around a partner's waist who walks alongside of them.

Origin  The origin of the shmoo plot is unclear. It is referenced in a 1966 IEEE paper.The Sensitivity Function in Variability Analysis, Charles Belove, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Volume R-15, Issue 2, August 1966. Another early reference is in manuals for IBM 2365 Processor Storage.64KByte gate in a Core Storage Unit, Virtual Museum, Newcastle University. According to the Virtual Museum page, this computer was installed in 1967. The invention of the shmoo plot is sometimes credited to VLSI Hall Of Fame inductee Robert Huston (1941-2006).VLSIresearch‚Äôs CHIP MAKING INDUSTRY HALL OF FAME, VLSI Research Inc. But this is unlikely because Huston did not begin working as a test engineer until 1967.Robert Huston Obituary, San Jose Mercury News, July 31 2006  Etymology  Cover of the Comic book \\"THE SHMOO\\" The plot takes its name from the Shmoo, a fictional species created by Al Capp in the cartoon Li'l Abner. These small, blob-like creatures have shapes similar to the \\"working\\" volumes that would be enclosed by shmoo plots drawn against three independent variables (such as voltage, temperature, and response speed). Semiconductor chips do not usually exhibit \\"shmoo\\" shape plots. Historically, testing of magnetic core memory arrays produced the \\"shmoo\\" shape and the term continued into the semiconductor era.  Description Shmoo plots are often used to represent the results of the testing of complex electronic systems such as computers or integrated circuits such as DRAMs, ASICs or microprocessors. The plot usually shows the range of conditions in which the device under test operates (in adherence with some remaining set of specifications). For example, when testing semiconductor memory: voltages, temperature, and refresh rates can be varied over specified ranges and only certain combinations of these factors will allow the device to operate. Plotted on independent axes (voltage, temperature, refresh rates), the range of working values will enclose a three-dimensional, usually oddly-shaped volume. Other examples of conditions and inputs that can be varied include frequency, temperature, timing parameters, system- or component-specific variables, and even varying knobs tweakable during silicon chip fabrication producing parts of varying quality which are then used in the process. Often one 'knob' or variable is plotted on one axis against another knob or variable on another axis, producing a two-dimensional graph. This allows the test engineer to visually observe the operating ranges of the device under test. This process of varying the conditions and inputs to the component or system may sometimes be referred to as 'shmooing' but more officially known as electrical testing or qualification. Automatic test equipment often contains software features that allow automated shmooing of a part.  Examples  Normal shmoo plot Abnormal shmoo plot Two-colored Shmoo plots for comparing good and bad devices Automated test equipment have traditionally generated a two-dimensional, ASCII form of the shmoo plot that uses an \\"X\\" to represent functional points and blank space for non-functional points. In modern times plots with two colors (e.g. red/green) or even multi colored plots in form of digital spread sheet documents and alike became also common, even if the traditional form is still in useEnergy optimization for an 28 nm sized storage semiconductor using ASCII Shmoo plots for read and write metrics, dated 2016. For testing efficiency sometimes only the border of interest (where a certain value changes its state) is backed up with data in the diagrams thus (often reasonably) assuming the areas outside those transition will stay at those state.[https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/day-in-the-life-of-a-chip- designer/4438729/Silicon-debug-challenges-and-guidelines Examples for thinned out, multi-color Shmoo diagrams, dated 2015 If sufficiently-wide ranges of the two independent variables were to be tested, a normal shmoo plot would show an operating envelope of some shape not unlike Al Capp's Shmoo, but in practice, this might damage the device under test, and finer-grained views are of much more interest, particularly focusing on published component margins (e.g., - 5% Vcc). When this is done, the operating envelope typically extends to the border of the plot in one or more directions. Sometimes a shmoo plot has an unusual and surprising shape, and while it is difficult to determine the exact cause, it is sometimes due to some unusual defect (perhaps in only part of a circuit) coupled with otherwise normal operation. In other cases, it might be an artifact of the electrical testing setup or the test program used, in particular a race condition. As such, a shmoo plot can be a useful test setup verification tool. A limitation of the technique is that the extended duration of testing of the device may cause additional internal device heating, resulting in a skewing of the data (later tested cells on the plot may perform worse than earlier ones). One way of avoiding this is to exercise the device thoroughly in a similar manner immediately before the actual shmoo test.

It is part of the civil parish of Lambourne and is served by Lambourne Parish Council. It takes its name from the brick bridge over the River Roding, which is situated just to the north of the modern centre, on the road to Theydon Bois. History Abridge lies on the historically important stagecoach route between London and Chipping Ongar and has been an important crossing point of the River Roding for many centuries. The boundary of the Conservation Area includes the historic core of the village which is evident on the Chapman and Andre Map of 1777. Originally in the parish of Lambourne, Holy Trinity Church was built in 1836; before this, parishioners had to walk three miles to Lambourne Church by a footpath. A Wesleyan chapel was built in Abridge in 1833; it became Congregational in 1844. The hymn tune \\"Abridge\\" by Isaac Smith 1734‚Äì1805 was named after the village. Listed buildings include the Blue Boar Inn (early 19th century), the group of medieval buildings that form the Roding Restaurant, the 18th-century house immediately northeast of the restaurant, Roding House (late medieval), River Cottage in Ongar Road, and the Maltsters Arms (18th century).

If they are not, they should adjust by turning 90 degrees or less to face them. *Each person extends and takes hold of right hand with the one they are facing (partner), and does a right-hand pull by (step forward with hands held, and release hand hold as passing right shoulder) *Each person advances to the next person in the ring, extends and takes hold of left hand with the one they are facing, and does a left-hand pull by (step forward with hands held, and release hand hold as passing left shoulder) *Each person advances to the next person in the ring (opposite), extends and takes hold of right hand with the one they are facing, and does a right-hand pull by (as described previously) *Each person advances to the next person in the ring, extends and takes hold of left hand with the one they are facing, and does a left-hand pull by (step forward with hands held, and release hand hold as passing left shoulder) It takes about 10 counts to complete the move. There are a number of styling flourishes which might accompany the basic moves. Note:Partner may not be original partner but usually is. The right and left grand family of calls There are two other calls which comprise the right and left grand family as defined by Callerlab, the largest international association of square dance callers. They are: *Weave the ring: A right and left grand without touching hands. *Wrong way grand: Essentially the same as a right and left grand, but instead of facing the way one does in a right and left grand (towards partner), one faces in the opposite direction (towards corner). Thus men (or gents) move clockwise around the ring and women (ladies) move counter-clockwise around the ring.

He is a horticulturalist, landscape architect, naturalist, television presenter and author. Baines grew up in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. He worked in the local parks department when he left school, and then studied horticulture and landscape architecture at university. Career After an early career in landscape contracting, including several years of greening desert landscapes in the Middle East and community landscaping on UK inner- city housing estates, Baines taught landscape architecture at post-graduate level until 1986, when he was awarded an honorary personal professorship at Birmingham Polytechnic in Birmingham. In 1980, he was one of a group of local environmentalists who co-founded the Urban Wildlife Group (now the Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country), the first of a series of such urban conservation organisations to appear in the UK that year. This was the beginning of a burgeoning urban wildlife movement with which he has always had a close association, and he remains Vice-President of the Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country. Through most of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Baines focused on television broadcasting, and presented The Big E, Saturday Starship, Pebble Mill at One and several other networked series. The BBC TV programme Countryfile evolved from his original regional series \\"Your Country Needs You\\" and Baines was one of Countryfile 's first presenters. Baines built the first wildlife garden ever allowed at Chelsea Flower Show in 1985, and in the same year his television programme Bluetits and Bumblebees, and his book, How to Make a Wildlife Garden, inspired many people to begin gardening with wildlife. The Wild Side of Town, which accompanied a five-part television series of the same name, won the U.K. Conservation Book Prize in 1987. His other books include four-story books for young children. His investigative environmental series for children, The Ark, won the International Wildscreen Award in 1987. Also in 1987, Chris recorded an album, The Wild Side of Town, with the folk-rock Albion Band and then toured the U.K., raising money for the British Wildlife Appeal. In 2000, he presented Charlie's Wildlife Gardens with Charlie Dimmock. Baines is one of the U.K.'s leading environmental campaigners, and in recent years he has particularly championed the cause of trees. He led the fight to prevent cable television and other utility companies chopping through the roots of urban street trees. He has also promoted the concept of urban forestry in the U.K. He was a founding member of the steering committee of CABE Space, the U.K. Government's urban greenspace adviser. He was principal adviser to Trees of Time and Place, a campaign for the millennium which encouraged people to gather seeds from a favourite tree, grow a seedling and plant it for the future. He also founded International Dawn Chorus Day in 1987. He was also a member of the steering board for the BBC's Breathing Places campaign. Baines is committed to urban wildlife and wildlife gardening. He works from home in Wolverhampton, is a national vice-president of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts. He is a former trustee of the Heritage Lottery Fund and also completed a further five years as a member of the HLF Expert Panel. He is President of the Association for Environment Conscious Building, the Thames Estuary Partnership and the Essex Wildlife Trust. In 2004 he was presented with the RSPB's annual Medal of Honour for his contribution to nature conservation and sustainable water management. In 2013 he was presented with the coveted Peter Scott Award by the British Naturalists Association. He is the patron of the Countryside Management Association and the Wildlife Gardening Forum, and president of the Wildside Activity Centre. Baines is also a member of the National Trust's natural environment advisory group. Baines works as a self-employed freelancer, and advises government ministers, local councils and senior executives in major water, minerals, finance, construction and housing companies, on environmental practice. He is particularly active as a professional environmental adviser to the house-building and development industry in the UK. He chaired the independent design review panel for the largest new housing development in the Thames Gateway, East of London at Barking Riverside and he also advised on sustainability at the 2012 Olympic Athletes' Village and Westfield Shopping City in Stratford, East London. He advised on regeneration in the UN World Heritage city of Bath, Somerset, and in the new township of the Hamptons, Peterborough, and was retained by developers Lend Lease to advise on green infrastructure for the redevelopment of the Heygate Estate, Elephant and Castle. In 2017 that development was shortlisted for the Stirling prize. He has a particular interest in the environment of retirement housing and worked for several years as an adviser to specialist developer Beechcroft. He also advised the UK government's Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) on biodiversity aspects of their proposed ecotowns. In 2010 he worked in the Gulf state of Qatar with the Boston Consulting Group, producing the twenty year forward strategy for that country's urban environments. He has particular expertise in the field of sustainable water management. He has worked for a number of UK water companies, spent time as an adviser to the water regulator OFWAT and has worked with the Environment Agency to improve communication of whole river catchment management. He also chairs the Stakeholder Advisory Group of the National Grid, appointed by the regulator Ofgem to provide independent guidance in a ¬£500 million programme to reduce the visual impact of pylons in National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Its former presence is recorded in Beaumont Street, Oxford. Set into a pillar on the north side of the street, near Walton Street, is a stone with the inscription: \\"Near to this site stood the King's Houses later known as Beaumont Palace. King Richard I was born here in 1157 and King John in 1167\\". The \\"King's House\\" was the range of the palace that contained the king's lodgings. Henry passed Easter 1133 in the nova aula, his \\"new hall\\" at Beaumont in great pomp, celebrating the birth of his grandson, the future Henry II.Henry of Huntington (Thomas Arnold, ed.) Historia Anglorum 1879:259; H. Hughes, Gladstone, Christ Church, and Oxford, an historic local retrospect, 1898:5. Edward I was the last king to sojourn in Beaumont officially as a palace, and in 1275 he granted it to an Italian lawyer, Francesco Accorsi, who had undertaken diplomatic missions for him.Oxford Streets: Inscriptions, Beaumont Palace Site: accessed 9 October 2013. When Edward II was put to flight at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, he is said to have invoked the Virgin Mary and vowed to found a monastery for the Carmelites (the White Friars) if he might escape safely. In fulfilment of his vow he remanded Beaumont Palace to the Carmelites in 1318. In 1318, the Palace was the scene for the beginnings of the John Deydras affair, in which a royal pretender, arguing that he was the rightful king of England, claimed the Palace for his own. John Deydras was ultimately executed for sedition.Weir, Alison. (2006) Isabella: She-Wolf of France, Queen of England. London: Pimlico, p.117. When the White Friars were disbanded at the Reformation, most of the structure was dismantled and the building stone reused in Christ Church and St John's College.\\"The ruins were rifled by St John's College in the sixteenth century to build its library\\" observes David Horan, Oxford: a cultural and literary companion :2000:186.

The majority of the park is located in the Abruzzo region, with smaller parts in Lazio and Molise. It is sometimes called by its former name Abruzzo National Park. The park headquarters are in Pescasseroli in the Province of L'Aquila. The park's area is .. It is the oldest in the Apennine Mountains, and the second oldest in Italy, with an important role in the preservation of species such as the Italian wolf, Abruzzo chamois and Marsican brown bear. Other characteristic fauna of the park are red deer and roe deer, wild boar and the white-backed woodpecker. The protected area is around two thirds beech forest, though many other tree species grow in the area, including silver birch and black and mountain pines. History Lake Barrea and Mount Marsicano. The idea for the Abruzzo National Park arose in the years following World War I thanks to the work of Erminio Sipari, environmentalist, member of Italian Parliament and cousin of Benedetto Croce.Luigi Piccioni, Erminio Sipari. Origini sociali e opere dell'artefice del Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, University of Camerino 1997; James Sievert, The Origins of Nature Conservation in Italy, Peter Lang (publishing company), Bern 2000, pp. 165-181; Marco Armiero - Marcus Hall (ed.), Nature and History in Modern Italy, Ohio University 2010 Between the months of October and November 1921, the municipality of Opi leased 5 square kilometres of land to a private federation with the aim of protecting flora and fauna and Sipari founded in Rome an organization to administer the reserve. So the Park was founded on September 1922.Lorenzo Arnone Sipari, Il Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo liberato dall'allagamento. Un conflitto tra tutela ambientale e sviluppo indutriale durante il fascismo, \\"Rivista della Scuola Superiore dell'Economia e Finanza\\", 2003, nr. 8-9: 27-39 ; Lorenzo Arnone Sipari (ed.), Scritti scelti di Erminio Sipari sul Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo (1922-1933), Trento 2011. Over the next few years the territory of the park expanded into neighbouring municipalities until it covered around 120 km¬≤ by 1923, when protection was enshrined in law. A period of intense activity followed and the park had further expanded to around 300 km¬≤ when it was abolished by the Fascist government in 1933. The monastery of San Vincenzo al Volturno Re-establishment of the park in 1950 coincided with a period of financial difficulty, followed by a building boom which saw more than 12,000 trees felled for the construction of houses, roads and ski tracks. A reorganisation of the park management at the end of the 1960s heralded better times and by 1976 further expansion, to 400 km¬≤, followed at the request of villages in neighbouring Molise, that were convinced by the economic benefits of the park. Today, at 500 km¬≤, the area of the park is 100 times larger than the original reserve. However the park's role in the marsican bear conservation program is now strongly debated; while every year there are monitoring actions of the total bear's population there have been recently some problems related to the pave actions carried out inside the park's boundaries and the building projects to connect the only ski track of the park to the opposite valley, which is a delicate spot for the bear's movements. Geography The mountains within the park are Petroso (2,249 metres), Marsicano (2,245 metres), Meta (2,242 metres), Tartaro (2,191 metres), Jamiccio (2,074 metres), Cavallo (2,039 metres), Palombo (2,013 metres). These are included in the Monti della Meta. The Sangro River rises near Pescasseroli and runs south-east through the artificial Lago di Barrea before leaving the park and turning to the north-east. Other rivers in the park are the Giovenco, Malfa and Volturno. Other lakes are Vivo, Pantaniello, Scanno, Montagna Spaccata, Castel San Vincenzo, Grottacampanaro, and Selva di Cardito. Fauna Italian wolf Abruzzo chamois In wildlife terms, the main attractions of the park are the Marsican brown bear and Italian wolf. While official figures report 50-70 bears in this genetically isolated population, the declining population is actually estimated at closer to 30. The shift from local agriculture to development in Abruzzo (including a controversial proposed ski resort) and poaching, threaten this remaining small population. While Wolves were once rarer (as low as 40), numbers have reportedly rebounded in recent years. The presence of the Eurasian lynx in the park is still controversial, and there are no scientific studies that prove it; however, there are some unconfirmed sightings. In greater numbers, in the thicker areas of the forest, are red deer and roe deer, reintroduced in the seventies, and the wild boar. Other reclusive inhabitants of the forest include European polecat, Eurasian badger, Eurasian otter and two species of marten; pine marten and beech marten. Higher, above the forest, Abruzzo chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) live alone or in small groups. Animals that are easier to see include red fox, the European hare, the least weasel, the European mole, and the western European hedgehog. Dormice and Calabrian black squirrel s are also quite frequently seen. Other mammals recorded in the park are the snow vole, the edible dormouse, the European wildcat and the Garden dormouse. Birds Many birds of prey inhabit the park. Most notable amongst them is the golden eagle, represented by six breeding couples, which, despite living in the more inaccessible regions, can often be seen soaring over central areas of the park in search of prey such as small mammals or even sick, young chamois. Other raptors that reside within the park include goshawks, peregrine falcons, Eurasian buzzards, Eurasian kestrels and Eurasian sparrowhawks. Less visible, but perhaps more audible, to the nighttime visitor are several species of owl, the little owl, the barn owl and the tawny owl. Woodland birds include the European green woodpecker and the rare white-backed woodpecker, cliffs harbour the red-billed chough and alpine chough and bare mountain birds include the rock partridge and white-winged snowfinch. streams provide habitat for the grey wagtail and white-throated dipper. Plants The flora of the park is rich and interesting. A comprehensive list of plants would extend to more than 2,000 species without including lichens, algae or fungi. Flowers present in the area include Marsican Iris (Iris marsica), gentian, primrose, cyclamen, violets and the lily. The most well-known flower of the park is the rare lady's slipper (Cypripedium calceolus), a yellow and black orchid. The predominant tree of the park is the beech which covers 60% of the area, generally grows at 900‚Äì1800 m altitude and provides a stunning display of colour throughout the whole year. Notable also the presence of some old-growth beech forests in the northern part of the park. Other trees are the black pine, the mountain pine and the silver birch. Municipalities The park covers 25 municipalities, distributed across 3 provinces.

Plot ;The Beginning Chaos arises in the now-failing Hacienda Buenavista, located in the province of Punta Verde, with a revolution forming among its farmers. Do√±a Benita Buenavista (Liza Lorena) orders her youngest son, Diego Buenavista (Jestoni Alarcon) to summon his older brother, Eduardo (Tonton Gutierrez). Unbeknownst to them, Eduardo is currently consummating his love with Amor de Jesus ( Eula Valdes), a maid from the hacienda, who he is in a secret relationship with. Amor hides under the bed, while Eduardo leaves with Diego to aid their mother. Do√±a Benita expresses her distress with their family's falling empire, and finds that the only solution to their financial troubles would be if Eduardo marries the mayor's daughter. Amor, who is now back in the mansion, overhears their conversation. As Benita leaves, Eduardo reassures Amor that he will not give in to his mother's desires. Unfortunately, Benita overhears; she degrades Amor, embarrassing her while making false accusations that she is only with Eduardo for wealth. Desperate to get rid of Amor, Benita orders her henchmen to throw her out of the mansion and restrain Eduardo. However, Eduardo chases after his lover. Out of desperation, Benita orders Diego, who is also in love with Amor, to do everything at all costs to separate them. Diego, who is also desperate for his mother's love and affection, gives in to her plans. Diego offers Amor a lift to her love shack with Eduardo, claiming his brother will soon follow. Benita then makes false claims that Amor left with Diego and insinuates that Eduardo follows them. Meanwhile, Diego attempts to rape Amor; Eduardo arrives, catching the two, and falsely accuses Amor of cheating on him. Amor chases Eduardo back to the mansion, begging for his mercy and for Diego to tell the truth. Under his mother's commands, Diego lies and clams that he has had a relationship with Amor long before she was with Eduardo, and that they planned to embezzle money from the hacienda and move away from Punta Verde. Eduardo believes Diego, thus, disowning Amor. He throws her into the trash, claiming the scent of her unfaithfulness will forever be stuck to her identity. With nowhere to go, Amor goes to the church, where she encounters a priest. The kind priest offers her to stay at the church while he goes to the Hacienda Buenavista to clear things up with Eduardo for Amor. However, the priest comes into contact with Benita, and after being blackmailed, is forced to banish Amor from the church and also Punta Verde. Finally homeless, Amor leaves Punta Verde and returns to the Talimpao dumpsite, where she resides with her mother. With Amor out of the picture, Benita sets her plan into motion to make Eduardo marry Claudia Zalameda (Jean Garcia), the daughter of the mayor of Punta Verde. Meanwhile, Amor finds out that she is pregnant with Eduardo's child and, out of anger at the Buenavistas, tries to kill the child. Amor decides to keep the child and sees an image on a newspaper of Eduardo and Claudia's union. Amor lets out a cry of anger and despair and promises that one day she will return and have her vengeance against the Buenavistas. Two years pass; Amor has given birth to a baby girl named Mar√≠a Amor. Wanting to provide a better life for her daughter, Amor survives by working as a female escort and dancer at a nightclub, together with her friend, Lourdes Magpantay (Amy Austria). Amor catches the eye of a rich African-American man named James Powers (James Cooper). Amor decides to leave her daughter with her mother, Chayong (Perla Bautista), and go with James to the United States in order to seek a better future for Mar√≠a Amor. As a keepsake, Amor leaves a bracelet with her daughter. On the other hand, Eduardo and Claudia marriage was proven to be a disaster, however, they produced a son named Angelo; Eduardo had become a drunk, while Claudia had become a woman of foul-language and cruel character. Later on, Diego confronts Benita about her lies, stating that she never loved him the way she loved Eduardo and only used him as a pawn to breakup Amor and Eduardo, and blames her for all of the misfortunes that happened to their family. Benita tries to chase after Diego to explain but, unfortunately, suffers a heart attack. Benita begs Claudia to help her, however, she chooses to leave her on the staircase to die. While on her deathbed, Benita seeks forgiveness from Eduardo, while trying to explain that she was the one who broke his relationship with Amor. However, she was unable to do so and died shortly after. After the funeral, Eduardo attempts to make amends with Diego and decides to give him the hacienda. However, Claudia fabricates documents claiming that Diego has been embezzling money; Eduardo banishes Diego from the hacienda. Attempting to forget Amor, Eduardo tries to open up his heart to Claudia; the two have sex and are summoned after a fire has broken out in a hut in the hacienda. In horror, Eduardo watches his love shack with Amor go to ruins. Meanwhile, a large landslide in the Talimpao dumpsite separated Mar√≠a Amor from her grandmother. Chayong is killed after a roll of garbage boulders at her, while Mar√≠a Amor survives after being placed under trash. The next day, the gravity of the situation unfolds as it is revealed that thousands of people lost their lives and homes. Among the people who lost their home is Belen (Eva Darren) and Isko Macaspac (Cris Daluz). Isko finds Mar√≠a Amor underneath the garbage and, coming to the conclusion that her family is dead, decides to adopt her; a small box is placed with the toddler. Belen and Isko find a drawing of Amor inside of the box with the word \\"Ynamorata.\\" They assume that is the child's mother's name and decide to name her \\"Ynamorata Macaspac\\" or \\"Yna\\" for short. ;Story The story begins with the romance between Amor de Jes√∫s (Eula Valdez) and Eduardo Buenavista (Tonton Gutierrez). Eduardo's mother, Do√±a Benita (Liza Lorena), opposes the relationship since Amor was a housemaid and because she wanted Eduardo to marry Claudia Zalameda (Jean Garcia) for political reasons. Do√±a Benita asked Eduardo's older brother, Diego (Jestoni Alarcon), who was also attracted to Amor, to separate them. Upon seeing Diego trying to rape Amor, Eduardo mistook it as them having a relationship, breaking his heart and prompts him to marry Claudia. The now-pregnant Amor was banished from the Buenavista hacienda and she returns to her mother in Manila, who was living at the Payatas dumpsite. She vows revenge on the Buenavista family when she learns that Eduardo has married Claudia. After giving birth to her daughter, Mar√≠a Amor (Kristine Hermosa), Amor and her friend, Lourdes (Amy Austria-Ventura), survived by working in clubs. Amor caught the eye of a rich American named James Powers (James Cooper), who brings her to the United States. She leaves Mar√≠a Amor and her mother, Chayong (Perla Bautista), behind at the dumpsite and sends money to them from time to time. James Powers proves abusive towards Amor, forbidding her from returning home when a landslide hit the dumpsite. Amor, thinking that her mother and daughter had died, and in retaliation for all his abuses towards her, does not get her husband medical help when he suffered a stroke. James Powers dies and Amor inherits his fortune. Eduardo and Claudia have two children: Angelo (Jericho Rosales) and Lia (Jodi Sta. Maria). Eduardo is the governor of the province of Punta Verde while Claudia has become the ever-elusive queen of illegal gambling in Punta Verde. Angelo is a rebel who dislikes his father while Lia is a sweet, devout Catholic teenager who cares for the feelings of her loved ones. Amor's daughter survives the landslide and is adopted by Isko (Cris Daluz) and Belen Macaspac (Eva Darren). The couple found drawings Eduardo made for Amor, signed \\"Ynamorata\\" near the abandoned child, so they decided to call the little girl they found Ynamorata. Isko and Belen have their own children: Caloy, who hates Yna, and teenager Flerida (Hazel Ann Mendoza). Do√±a Benita regretted forcing Eduardo to marry Claudia, as her daughter-in-law turned out to be cruel. On her deathbed, she tried to explain that she was the one who broke Eduardo's relationship with Amor, but died before being able to do so. To atone for her sins, Do√±a Benita's spirit haunts the dreams of the grown Yna. Twenty years later, Yna and Eduardo accidentally meet, and Yna dreams of Do√±a Benita showing her that her past lies in the Buenavista family. Intrigued, she gets a job working as a housemaid in Eduardo's household. Yna and Angelo fall in love, much to Claudia's chagrin. She looks down on housemaids and servants, and actively makes Yna's life a living hell. Amor Powers returns to the Philippines after making a name for herself in the business world in the United States. Amor had been planning her revenge on the Buenavistas, whom she blames for her past sufferings, as well as the assumed death of Mar√≠a Amor. The dilemma was that, after finding out that Yna's true father was Eduardo, Angelo and Yna were therefore thought to be half-siblings. It was later revealed that Angelo's biological father was not Eduardo, nor was it Simon Barcial (John Arcilla), Claudia's former, impoverished lover. Angelo's biological father was later revealed to be Eduardo's brother, Diego (who was also revealed to be adopted), who sired Angelo with a poor woman named Thelma, who had later died. It also turns out that Claudia had a daughter with Simon. Claudia's father switched the babies after Do√±a Benita demanded a male heir (the boy that replaced the girl was revealed to be Angelo). The daughter was Clarissa (Dianne dela Fuente) and she was raised by an old woman named Pur√≠ng (Anita Linda) as Mar√≠a Amor. Puring had Clarissa believe she was Maria Amor de Jes√∫s, the daughter of Amor. To exact revenge on Amor, Claudia kills Mar√≠a Amor/Clarissa, but was deeply crushed when she later learned the girl's true identity. Her heart filled with more anger towards Amor, as well as regret. Claudia, together with Coring (Minnie Aguilar) and her henchmen, planned to kill the entire Buenavista family at Yna and Angelo's wedding. Thus, confronting them while holding a gun. But everyone especially Angelo and Lia made her realize how important she is to them and how she should bring out the goodness in her heart that was once filled with evil, hatred, greed and revenge. She realizes everything after Lia and Angelo gave her a hug and reconciles with everyone at the wedding. People from the wedding especially Amor and Angelo also asked forgiveness from Claudia, which she immediately accepted. While she was kneeling in front of everyone, she sees Clarissa's spirit at the altar and begs forgiveness. Claudia was forgiven by everyone but because of her past crimes, she was sentenced to lifelong imprisonment. And a little while later, Amor gave her Clarissa's ashes. Five years later, each of the major characters are happy and reunited with their true loves: Yna becomes pregnant and marries Angelo, Claudia meets her granddaughter from her now-deceased daughter, Lia. Afterwards, she and Simon married each other inside prison. Meanwhile, Amor and Eduardo decided to live happily as a couple and married each other after 27 years of their unbreakable love for each other.

He was a member of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which was based in Maida Vale, London, for 25 years from 1969 to 1994.  Biography  Clarke proved somewhat controversial when he joined the Workshop, due to his view that radiophonic music should be, in his words, \\"fine art,\\" a philosophy that was not shared by other workshop members at the time. Clarke composed the incidental music for the Doctor Who serial The Sea Devils (1972); it was the second score that the Radiophonic Workshop provided for the series. Clarke produced the music for this serial on the Radiophonic Workshop's EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer. The score was experimental, unusual and controversial for Doctor Who at the time, with producer Barry Letts insisting that substantial edits be made for the finished programme. His score for the serial has been described as \\"startling in its range of obtrusive electronic timbres and relative melodic paucity\\", \\"mixed music and sound effects\\" and \\"presented uncomfortable sounds to a substantial early evening audience on Saturdays in a way not duplicated in Britain before or since\\". The Radiophonic Workshop was not commissioned to produce music again for Doctor Who until 1980, when new producer John Nathan-Turner decided to fire regular composer Dudley Simpson and commission music from the Workshop instead. Clarke returned to the series to compose the music for the 1982 serial Earthshock. He continued to work on the series on a regular basis until 1986, composing the music for Enlightenment, Resurrection of the Daleks, The Twin Dilemma, Attack of the Cybermen and Terror of the Vervoids. Clarke was critically acclaimed for the 1976 radio piece August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains, based on a short story by Ray Bradbury. Outside his music interests, Clarke was an automobile enthusiast. Over a period of years he built a Bugatti from a collection of spare and scavenged parts.

Warrington Bank Quay is a north-south oriented mainline station on one side of the main shopping area, with the west-east oriented Warrington Central on the other side to the north west operating a more frequent service to the neighbouring cities of Liverpool and Manchester. Cheshire Cat Buses are operated from the station into Warrington Bus Interchange and in the opposite direction to the Centre Park business park, Stockton Heath and further south into Cheshire. The station is directly on the West Coast Main Line. Layout The station consists of two island platforms. The easternmost retains the 19th century buildings, with the western island's buildings dating from the 1950s. Passengers enter the station at street level through a functional modern entrance containing an information office and ticket office, and proceed through a subway, reaching the elevated platforms by stairs or a lift. There is a buffet on the eastern platform. Platform 1 serves arrivals and departures to Liverpool Lime Street with this service terminating at the platform, and occasionally for North Wales services. Platform 2 is generally used for North Wales services, and southbound intercity services to Birmingham New Street and London Euston. Platform 3 serves northbound intercity trains to Edinburgh and Glasgow Central. Platform 4 for services from North Wales to Manchester. The platforms are not bidirectional, except that the slow line between the station and Winwick Junction, some to the north. This allows northbound departures from platform 1. The present platform 4 was numbered 5 for many years, because there was to be a north-facing bay platform in the west island which was numbered 4, but this saw no passenger use after electrification in 1972 being removed later. The station's best known landmark is the huge Unilever detergent manufacturing plant which stands overlooking the site. The station suffered from years of neglect and, because of this, Virgin Trains announced improvements to the station. In 2009, an extension to the existing car park and a new taxi rank were built, along with improvements to the platforms and a new ticket office and travel centre. The new entrance hall is now complete, with a ticket office and a newsagents. The buffet on the London bound platforms has been modernised, however a first class lounge is yet to materialise. Low Level Until 1965 the west-east oriented platforms, 6 and 7, were situated on what had been the St Helens Railway lines which pass beneath the station and the north-south West Coast Main Line. The West Coast Main Line was elevated to pass over the west to east line when the current station was opened in 1868). Although it was not the official title, this part of the station was referred to as Bank Quay Low Level. The line remains for freight use only. Services The station lies on the West Coast Main Line, operated by Avanti West Coast, with regular services to London, Birmingham, and Scotland.5 A regular regional express service operates between Manchester, Chester and North Wales operated by Transport for Wales.GB eNRT May 2017 Edition, Table 81 There are also local electric services to Liverpool operated by Northern and one early morning service per day to Ellesmere Port via Helsby with returning morning and afternoon services.GB eNRT MAy 2017 Edition, Tables 90 & 109 A Virgin Pendolino, at platform 2, waiting to head south Normal weekday service consists of: *Hourly to London Euston direct, operated by Avanti West Coast *Hourly to London Euston via Birmingham New Street, operated by Avanti West Coast *A Virgin Voyager, at platform 3, with a service to Scotland Hourly to Glasgow Central, operated by Avanti West Coast *Two-hourly to Edinburgh Waverley, operated by Avanti West Coast *Two-hourly to Glasgow Central, operated by Avanti West Coast *An Arriva Trains Wales Class 175, at platform 3, with the service to Manchester Piccadilly Hourly to Manchester Airport via Manchester Piccadilly, operated by Transport for Wales *Hourly to Llandudno, operated by Transport for Wales *Hourly to Liverpool Lime Street operated by Northern *Hourly to Leeds via Manchester Victoria operated by Northern *Hourly to Chester (express - Northern) *Hourly operated by Northern terminates here from Liverpool Lime Street *There is also a limited service to Ellesmere Port operated by Northern  Gallery  Image:Warrington Bank Quay railway station 2057584 3a5a1e72.jpgThe station in 1962 Image:Warrington Bank Quay 2 railway station 2064415 ddb7f5b0.jpgView southward, towards Crewe and Chester 1963 Image:Platform building, Warrington Bank Quay railway station (geograph 4019996).jpgA building at the southern end of platform 2 Image:Cafe shop, Warrington Bank Quay railway station (geograph 4020016).jpgThe shop on platform 2  Kissing ban  The station received media coverage in February 2009 due to a sign recently erected prohibiting kissing from its drop-off point. The reason stated is to avoid queues as the station becomes busier. Colin Daniels, chief executive of the Warrington Chamber of Commerce originally suggested the idea light-heartedly, but Virgin Trains have included it as part of their regeneration of the station. The signs were removed three weeks later and sold to raise money for Comic Relief with Virgin spokesman Ken Gibbs admitting that the idea was just a bit of fun.

History  Maharaja Lachhman Singh of Shekhawati constructed the Lachhmangarh Fort in 1710 AD, and around it he established the present Lachhmangarh town, which was founded in 1712 AD. Maharaja Lachhman Singh of Shekhawati princely state planned it nearly 300 years ago under the Shekhawati region of erstwhile. The reigning kingdom of jaipur had many thikanas and was one of them. The Thakurs of these Thikana were called Maharajkumars and Mahendra Singh, son of HH Maharao Shri Sir Madho Singh Ji Bahadur was the first Maharajkumar of Lachhmangarh and that happened to be the Maharajkumars of Lachhmangarh. Among the popular families of Lacchmangarh are the Ganeriwal family that resides at the biggest this haveli of Shekhawati region. Most recently, Lachhmangarh has been of public curiosity due to its place in modern literature. The fictional character Balram Halwai from the bestselling novel The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga came from a village by the same name, but it isn't the same village, because the book is actually set in the Gaya District in the vicinity of Bodh Gaya in the state of Bihar. = Maharajkumars = The Thikana of Lachhmangarh was granted by HH Maharao Shri Sir Madho Singh Ji Bahadur of Shekhawati in 1936 to his son, Mahendra Singh.

The Laxmangarh Fort is the best monument of the town. The nearing area of the Laxmangarh town are also very rich in heritage. The PEER Baba ki Samadhi located in the revenue village of Alkhpura Bogan near Hapas is also a 300-year-old monument. The monument is a place of worship for both the Hindus and Muslims of the area. The great fair is organised every year on the sixth of Bhadarpad (Hindi Month). Large number of people participate in the fair. The area is arid ridden and the main source of their income is agriculture. The agriculture is based on the monsoon rains. The average rainfall in the area is also very less. Certain farmers are now constructing tubewells in the area for irrigation purposes. The aerial view of the surrounding area is magnificent that can be enjoyed from the roof top of the Samadhi Building, the eastern side is more splendid. The greenery view of Choudhary ParsaRam Dhaka's Farm House located at 400 metres is eye catching. The large workforce is also migrated to Gulf countries as labour and earning their livelihood. Certain people of the area are also engaged in the Hawala business. The Hawala operators and the money pumped in by these gulf earners through these operators, impair the fair assessment of the income of the people. Demographics As of 2011 India census Laxmangarh had a population of 81253. Males constitute 51.26% ( 41098) of the population and females 48.74%(40155). Laxmangarh has an average literacy rate of 72.70%, which is lower than the national average of 74.04%; male literacy is 83.74%, and female literacy is 61.24%. In Laxmangarh, 13.85%(7394) of the population is younger than 6 years old. The depleting sex ratio in the area is a cause of great concern. The area around Laxmangarh is Jat(Choudhary) dominated demography of the area has wide differences and the male, female ratio below 15 years is 1000:650-725. The varying sex ratio in the area compelled the expecting grooms to arrange brides from the areas of Assam, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. There is also a wide gap in the education level between the male and female population in the area: females, for example, shine in competitions and at academic examinations. There have been many generous people who have contributed in increasing the town's rich culture by building temples and establishments (small infrastructures) that have gained more tourists. Water Groundwater is the only drinkable water in the region; even when the level of the water table dips very low the people still find ways to obtain it. The TDS level of the local groundwater is 1000 PPM to 3500 PPM, which is quite high; consequently, most educated people use some sort of water purification method, for example reverse osmosis or ultraviolet. Laxmangarh Fort Laxmangarh Fort The most imposing building in this town is its small fortress (owned by the Jhunjhunwala family) which looms over the well laid out township on its west side. Laxman Singh, the Raja of Sikar, built the fort in the early 19th century after Kan Singh Saledhi besieged the prosperous town. The fort of Laxmangarh is one of the most unique pieces of fort architecture in the world, because the structure is built on top of scattered pieces of huge rocks. The Laxmangarh Fort is private property - owned by a local businessman and is closed to the public. You can, however, climb the ramp to a temple which is open to the public, and the view from the ramp can be quite fascinating too. Of course, seeing the town from this height tempts you to go further higher, but a guard effectively keeps the public out. This fort is also connected to another fascinating heritage site of the town ‚ÄòChar Chowk Ki Haveli‚Äô or commonly known as Ganeriwal Haveli. It is nominated un Indian Heritage site. This haveli is also built alongside Laxmanghar fort and was given to Ganeriwal's to maintain town administration and main bazar. It is also a common belief that most popular Birla family were munim's (taxman) to Ganeriwal's 200 years ago. Also a frequent visit site for Shivaji. Newer generation of Ganeriwals still reside at this haveli and Mr. Girdhari Ganeriwal is the heads the property of approximately 300 rooms.

The Wuhuan (, Old Chinese:  îÀ§a …¢ ∑ÀÅar) were a Proto-Mongolic nomadic people who inhabited northern China, in what is now the provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, Shanxi, the municipality of Beijing and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia.  History After the Donghu \\"Eastern Barbarians\\" were defeated by the Xiongnu around 209 BC, they split into two groups. The northern Donghu became the Xianbei while the southern Donghu living around modern Liaoning became the Wuhuan. According to the Book of Later Han, ‚Äúthe language and culture of the Xianbei are the same as the Wuhuan‚Äù. Until 121 BC, the Wuhuan was a tributary of the Xiongnu empire. The Book of Later Han (Ch. 120) says: \\"From the time that Modu Shanyu crushed them the Wuhuan became weak. They were kept in constant subjugation to the Xiongnu and were forced to pay annual taxes of cow, horse and sheep skins. If anybody did not pay this tax his wife and children were taken from him.\\" In 121 BC, the Han dynasty general Huo Qubing defeated the eastern wing of the Xiongnu. He then settled the Wuhuan in five commanderies (Shanggu, Yuyang, Youbeiping, Liaoxi and Liaodong) created on the northern Chinese border in order to use them to keep watch of the Xiongnu. The chieftains of the Wuhuan paid annual visits to the Han capital Chang'an and were given rewards. In 78 BC, the Wuhuan looted the tombs of the Xiongnu chanyus. The outraged Xiongnu rode east and defeated them. Fan Minyou was sent with 20,000 men to aid the Wuhuan. However he arrived too late and the Xiongnu were out of his reach so he attacked the Wuhuan instead, defeated them and beheaded three of their kings. In 71 BC, the Wuhuan joined the Han, Dingling, and Wusun to defeat the Xiongnu. In 7 AD, the Han convinced the Wuhuan to stop sending tribute to the Xiongnu, who immediately attacked and defeated the Wuhuan. In 49 AD, Hedan, the Wuhuan elder of the Liaoxi district, came to the Han court with 922 other chieftains and \\"paid tribute\\" to Emperor Guangwu of Han with slaves, cattle, horses, bows and tiger, leopard and sable skins. In 58 AD, the Xianbei chieftain Pianhe attacked and killed Xinzhiben, a Wuhuan leader causing trouble in Yuyang Commandery. In 109 AD, the Wuhuan joined the Xianbei in attacking Wuyuan Commandery and defeated local Han forces. In 168 AD, the Wuhuan established some degree of independence under their own leaders. The largest of these groups were led by Nanlou in Shanggu, Qiuliju in Liaoxi, Supuyan in the Dependent State of Liaodong, and Wuyan in Youbeiping. In 187 Qiuliju joined the rebellion of Zhang Chun. Following the defeat of Zhang Chun in 188, Qiuliju attacked Gongsun Zan but was defeated. In 190 he surrendered to Liu Yu and died in 193. Qiuliju's son Louban was too young to succeed him so his cousin Tadun became acting guardian. In 195 Tadun, Nanlou and Supuyan supported Yuan Shao against Gongsun Zan. In 207 Tadun was defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain and died in battle. After their defeat many of the Wuhuan surrendered to Cao Cao and served as part of Cao Cao's cavalry forces. Louban and Supuyan fled to Gongsun Kang, who killed them. Cao Cao divided the Wuhuan into three groups situated in Dai Commandery.

It is one of the two traditional industrial suburbs in the Perth metropolitan region. History Kwinana is originally a local indigenous Australian word meaning either \\"young woman\\" or \\"pretty maiden\\". The ship SS Kwinana was wrecked on Cockburn Sound in 1922, and blown on to the beach. The nearby area acquired the name Kwinana Beach when the local postmistress, Clara Wells, immediately started labeling the mail sacks \\"Kwinana Wreck\\", to distinguish the settlement there from Rockingham, to the south. Kwinana Beach was officially adopted as a township in 1937. With the new industrial developments at Kwinana Beach in the 1950s, led by BP's Kwinana Refinery, a large new workers settlement ‚Äì Kwinana Townsite ‚Äì was purpose-built slightly inland. Other industries quickly followed ‚Äì Alcoa,Alcoa of Australia Limited official website CSBP,CSBP official website CBH,About CBH Coogee Chemicals, and others. The original village at Kwinana Beach was rezoned 'industrial', and scheduled for resumption and compulsory purchase as early as 1953 ‚Äì apparently unbeknown to the residents. Confirmed in the Stephenson Plan (1955), this was ratified by State Parliament in the 1963 Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme. However, building applications were still being approved throughout the 1960s, and beyond ‚Äì with a vague warning that the land was earmarked for \\"potential industrial development\\". There was no real public comment until 1968, following increased pollution, nuisance, and health problems from the growing industrial development just north of the village. This led to a rather lively Council meeting at the Kwinana Beach Hall in September, 1969. The dangers of property resumption were played down by the Kwinana Mayor, Cr. F. Baker, who advised residents to stay put and see what happened. The Air Pollution consultant, Mr A. Keil, informed them that, though there were no immediate plans to use the land for industry, it was a definite possibility ‚Äì and pollution problems were \\"unavoidable\\", and would only get worse. Residents responded that they didn't mind moving, so long as the compensation was fair, and enabled them to purchase a property of at least equal value ‚Äì rather than leaving them in debt. Finally, a committee was formed to look into the issues. Matters remained in limbo throughout the 1970s, with residents accepting resumption of their properties as conditions became increasingly intolerable. With the exception of the huge CBH grain silos and jetty, very little of this land was ever actually used by industry. Today, rail lines connect local industries to their supplies, snaking through the ruins of the houses and gardens which line the original Kwinana Beach Road. To the north of the Kwinana Beach area, enormous jetties jut out into the deep-water harbour of Cockburn Sound. Starting with the Kwinana wreck at Wells Park (named for the postmistress, Clara Wells, who inadvertently named the area in 1922), the Kwinana Beach coastline down to Rockingham is now largely used as beach and recreation areas. The Kwinana wreck itself is now an unrecognisable, short concreted line-fishing jetty. Motorsport Kwinana Beach is home to the Perth Motorplex which incorporates an international standard drag racing strip, and a dirt track speedway. The Motorplex opened in 2000, replacing the old Ravenswood Raceway Drag Racing strip (1969‚Äì1999), and the Claremont Speedway which had operated from 1927 until 2000 and is recognised as the longest running speedway in Australia.Perth Motorplex official website Notes References Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia Category:Suburbs in the City of Kwinana Category:Economy of Perth, Western Australia ","title":"Kwinana Beach, Western Australia"},{"id":"2597254","text":"Kwinana Town Centre is a suburb of the City of Kwinana in the outer southern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia.

Manchester Piccadilly Station, the terminus of the southern Liverpool to Manchester route There once were four direct railway routes between Liverpool and Manchester in the North West of England, however only two remain, the two centre routes of the four. The most northerly and the most southerly of the four routes are no longer direct lines. Of the remaining two direct routes, the northern route of the two is fully electric with the now southern route a diesel-only line. The most northerly of the four, has been split into two routes, with the western section operated by Merseyrail electric trains and the eastern section by diesel trains, requiring passengers to change trains between the two cities. The fourth route, the most southerly of the four, has been largely abandoned east of Warrington, with the remaining section mostly catering for freight trains. The remaining two direct routes are: * The northern route from terminus station via and to either , or . This line follows the route of the original 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway. * The southern route from terminus via to Manchester Piccadilly operates on lines formerly owned by the Cheshire Lines Committee.  Northern route  1869 map showing the northern route and southern route The northern route runs from Liverpool Lime Street station, via and , and continues to either or . The line follows George Stephenson's original 32-mile (51.5 km) Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830, which was the world's first inter-city passenger railway and the first to have run 'scheduled' services. Many early steam locomotives were initially used on this line including Stephenson's Rocket, which won the Rainhill Trials in 1829 (see List of Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotives). The line also includes a number of listed structures including stations and bridges, particularly the Rainhill Skew Bridge and the nine-arch Sankey Viaduct. The line uses Class 319 electric EMU units. = Current services = Following completion of electrification in May 2015, services to and Manchester Victoria are operated by Class 319 4-Car Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) or Class 323 3-Car Electric Multiple Units (EMUs). An hourly semi-fast service is operated by Northern Trains, from to , via , , , , , Manchester Airport and Wilmslow. Northern Trains also operates an hourly service calling at all stations along the line between Liverpool Lime Street and . This 'stopping service' is supplemented by an additional all-stations service between Liverpool Lime Street and , which continues along the West Coast Main Line to . Between Earlestown and Manchester Piccadilly, there are additional hourly services operated by Transport for Wales, which originate from via the North Wales Coast Line and . On Sundays there is one train per hour along the line, calling at all stations to Manchester Piccadilly except and . It is operated by Northern and continues to Manchester Airport. Northern Trains is the dominant operator on the route, and its services are operated with Class 319 4-Car EMUs or Class 150, Class 156 and Class 142 Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs). Transport for Wales services between Earlestown and Manchester Piccadilly are usually operated by Class 175 DMUs, but Class 158 units may be substituted on occasions. From the May 2014 timetable change, a new hourly First TransPennine Express service from Newcastle Central to Liverpool Lime Street via York, Leeds, Huddersfield and Manchester Victoria was introduced. This service is operated by Class 185 DMUs and runs non-stop between Manchester Victoria and Liverpool Lime Street (32 minutes). From the May 2018 timetable change, all TransPennine Express services to/from Liverpool now operate via the Northern route. After Manchester, the services usually go on to either Newcastle, Scarborough, York or Middlesbrough. They previously used the unelectrified Southern route, via Warrington Central. All TransPennine Express services are operated by Class 185 DMUs. The northern Liverpool to Manchester route is also used by East Midlands Railway for empty coaching stock (ECS) movements, and as a diversionary route when the southern route is closed. In past years, the line has been used by many express services which included through trains to , and Newcastle (via ), and to , and Edinburgh (diverging on to the West Coast Main Line at Newton-le-Willows). Local trains also ran to Manchester via Leigh, but these services ceased in 1969 when the Eccles-Tyldesley-Leigh-Kenyon branch was closed as a result of the Beeching Axe. The northern Liverpool to Manchester line has also seen regular use over the years for diverted services from the West Coast Main Line when parts of the latter have been closed for engineering work, but diversions via Manchester instead have now become more common as they do not involve the train reversing, as would be necessary at Edge Hill, following the electrification of the route. = Technical details = The key junctions on this route are: * Edge Hill West Jn (to CLC line via Warrington Central) * Edge Hill East Jn (to Edge Hill CS) * Bootle Branch Jn (to Canada Dock Branch, leading to the docks) * Olive Mount Jn (Olive Mount Jn Chat Moss to Regent Rd) * Huyton Jn (to Wigan line) * Earlestown West Jn (West Coast Main Line Southbound via Warrington Bank Quay) * Earlestown East Jn (West Coast Main Line Southbound via Warrington Bank Quay) * Newton-le-Willows Jn (for daily Wigan via Golborne Junction services) * Parkside Jn (for daily Wigan via Golborne Junction services) * Eccles Station Jn (to the Weaste branch towards the Manchester Ship Canal) * Ordsall Lane Jn (separates Chat Moss line (to Victoria) from Bolton lines (to Piccadilly) .

Manchester Victoria station itself is now electrified and at the new timetable changeover on 17 May 2015 Liverpool to Manchester Victoria stopping services also began electric operation using the same rolling stock. As a result of completion of the Manchester Castlefield Junction to Newton-le-Willows Junction electrification, TransPennine Express services between and / now use new Class 350 EMUs and are re-routed along a portion of the northern Liverpool to Manchester route before joining the West Coast Main Line at Golborne Junction. TransPennine Express Class 185 DMUs which formerly operated the Manchester Airport - Glasgow/Edinburgh service are now being redeployed to other routes. The Department for Transport initially announced in July 2009 that the northern route of the Manchester to Liverpool line was to be electrified with 25 kV, 50 Hz AC, overhead line. The electrification process was originally due to be completed by 2013 however, following a change of government in 2010, the work was delayed by the government meaning that, while the Manchester to Newton-le-Willows section was completed by December 2013 to enable Manchester - Scotland electric services, the remaining section to Liverpool was not completed until 5 March 2015. Now that the electrification of the line is complete and electric services are running, the journey time between Liverpool and Manchester has been reduced from around 45 minutes to 30 minutes due to the greater acceleration achieved by electric trains and the raising of the speed limit along the line from 75 to 90 mph. Class 319 EMUs have been fully refurbished and transferred from the Thameslink route to operate between Liverpool and Manchester, while Thameslink services will be operated by new energy-efficient trains, which were originally due to be delivered between 2011 and 2013. Electrification also offers electric haulage options for freight trains, giving a secondary route to the West Coast Main Line from Liverpool.  Southern route (old Cheshire Lines Committee line) The original Manchester Central terminus station 1899 map showing the southern route The southern route runs from Liverpool Lime Street via to . There are four passenger trains per hour (tph) in each direction between Liverpool and Manchester, which are usually operated by a variety of Class 185, Class 150, Class 156, Class 158 and Class 142 Diesel Multiple Units. These services are run by a number of rail companies and the time intervals are not evenly spaced out; there are large gaps between some services, and at other times trains leave within minutes of each other. TransPennine Express uses modern Class 185 trains, while other operators run a mixture of older rolling stock. While TransPennine Express' once per hour service generally take 45 minutes to reach Manchester from Liverpool Lime Street, some Northern services take an hour and ten minutes to cover the 35 miles. This route is busier than the northern route in terms of service frequency (2 express & 2 stopping trains per hour each way over the entire route, compared to 1 express, 1 semi-fast and 1 through stopping train via Earlestown, though additional Transport for Wales and TransPennine Express services use the eastern end of the northern route). The line's newest station is Liverpool South Parkway which opened in June 2006 after its estimated construction cost of ¬£16 million had doubled to ¬£32 million by the time it was completed. This station replaced and Garston stations and has frequent bus links to Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Warrington West railway station was opened in December 2019. Originally this line ran from High Level terminus station to terminus station built by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) in 1873. High Level station was demolished in 1973 due to all the long haul distance services on Merseyside being concentrated at with Merseyrail operating the local urban services with underground stations in Liverpool and Birkenhead centres. Manchester Central closed in 1969 and is now the Manchester Central Convention Complex. At the Liverpool end, the line from Hunts Cross to Central High Level station‚Äîwhich accessed the station via a tunnel‚Äîwas given over to the Northern Line of the electric Merseyrail services and the line from Hunts Cross diverted in 1966 onto the short section of the West Coast Main Line to Lime Street station. The divergence is at Allerton Junction to the immediate south east of . In 1977-8 the original line in the tunnel approaching Liverpool Central High Level terminus was dropped into a new lower level tunnel immediately south of the station to enter Liverpool Central underground station becoming a through line continuing underground to the north of Liverpool and onto Southport. The Low Level underground station and tunnel was built in 1890 to align with the approach tunnel to the High Level station if in the future the need was there. Victorian foresight was utilised nearly 80 years later. At the Manchester end the line was diverted to and Manchester Piccadilly after Manchester Central was closed. The Liverpool to Warrington section of this line was initially scheduled to be on the Merseyrail electric urban network. The Strategic Plan for the North West, the SPNW, in 1973 envisaged that the Outer Loop which was to be an orbital line circling the city of Liverpool, the Edge Hill Spur which is a tunnel connecting the east of Liverpool to the central underground sections, and the lines to St. Helens, Wigan and Warrington would be electrified and all integrated into Merseyrail by 1991. This meant that trains from Warrington would access Liverpool city centre's underground stations via the Northern Line and Liverpool Central underground station, giving access to Liverpool's shopping and business quarters. This never transpired, however is a long-term aspiration of Merseytravel. =Planned electrification= Trains run on electrified track within the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, however only diesel engine propulsion is used taking no advantage of the electrification. This line has been prioritised for full electrification between the two cities, however no date has been set for the commencement of works. = Current services = Presently (2019), a half-hourly fast service operates between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly, calling at Warrington Central and Manchester Oxford Road. One train per hour is operated by East Midlands Railway. East Midlands Railway' services usually also stop at Liverpool South Parkway and , and continue beyond Manchester to via Sheffield and , Since the May 2018 timetable change, TransPennine Express no longer operate on the route, and now use the Northern Liverpool - Manchester Line, via Newton-le-Willows There are also several local services per hour operated by Northern Trains along the southern route to Manchester Oxford Road, which extend to Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport every hour. Many intermediate stations are served by all of these trains, although some just by one per hour, while , and are served only once every 2 hours outside peak periods. The Sunday service is two trains per hour, with one service calling at all stations and one running semi-fast. East Midlands Railway mainly use Class 158s along the line, although Class 153s and Class 156s are used sometimes. Northern Trains operate a mixture of Class 156, Class 150 and Class 142 units along the line. In the past, the CLC route was used by a variety of local services in addition to limited-stop expresses between the two cities. These included trains between Warrington Central and , Liverpool and Manchester to and even Liverpool to via , although the latter route was closed as long ago as 1952. The diversion of Liverpool-bound trains to Lime Street in 1966 and the closure of Manchester Central in 1969 (all trains subsequently running to Oxford Road and Piccadilly) saw the route downgraded in importance and from then until the mid-1980s it was operated as a self-contained route due to congestion issues at the Manchester end. The service frequency was also lower than at present, for example the British Rail 1985 timetable had one semi-fast and one stopping train per hour in each direction on weekdays (excluding the weekday peaks periods). Through running to destinations east of Manchester via this route only began on a regular basis in 1986, when the opening of a new connection at allowed trains from the Sheffield direction to run via Stockport and thus avoid conflicting movements across the station throat at Piccadilly. The route from Liverpool to Manchester via Newton le Willows has been popular in recent years with steam locomotive worked excursion trains. The 2nd route from Liverpool through Hunts Cross and Warrington Central to Manchester rarely sees steam worked excursion trains, the most recent being in 2013 for the 45th anniversary special run of the Fifteen Guinea Special. The original route through Newton le Willows being shut for electrification work. = Technical details = The key junctions on this route are: * Lime Street (used to move trains onto appropriate platform) * Edge Hill East Junction (for the Huyton line) * Allerton West Junction (to West Coast Main Line, known as Allerton junction) * Hunts Cross Junction (to Merseyrail Northern Line) * Glazebrook East Junction (formerly for Warrington- Stockport services, but now used as a passing point) * Trafford Park Junction (for Euroterminal freight terminal) * Castlefield Junction (where lines to Manchester converge). During a journey trains are controlled by: * Lime Street control (LS) (Lime Street and the Lime Street tunnels) - now dedicated desk at new Manchester Rail Operating Centre (LL) * Edge Hill signal box (LE) (Edge Hill to Edge Hill junction) * Allerton signal box (AN) (Edge Hill junction to Liverpool South Parkway) * Hunts Cross signal box (HC) (Allerton junction to Widnes Station) * Warrington Central signal box (WC) (Widnes station to Padgate station) * Glazebrook East signal box (GE) (Birchwood station to Urmston) * Manchester Piccadilly control (MP) (Urmston to route terminus) The above is likely to change in the future as various sections are migrated over to the control of the new Manchester Rail Operating Centre at Ashburys.  Former direct routes  =Via Kirkby (L&YR;/LMR)= It is possible to travel between Liverpool and Manchester, with a change of train from underground station via Kirkby and Wigan Wallgate to . However, since 1977, this line requires a change at Kirkby, using the same platform, to change from the Merseyrail electric Northern Line trains to the Northern diesel trains. Sections of this route were built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and their acquired railways, such as the Liverpool and Bury Railway and the Manchester and Southport Railway. This line was partially built by the Liverpool and Bury Railway, opening in 1848, which later merged into the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway who on acquisition owned the Manchester and Southport Railway which formed the complete continuous line from Liverpool into Manchester. The route was continuous from Liverpool Exchange terminus to . With the creation of the electric Merseyrail urban network the line was effectively cut into two with two different modes of traction. The Liverpool half is fast third rail electric and the Manchester side slower diesel traction. The point at which the two modes meet is Kirkby which functions as a terminus for the electric and diesel services. The Merseyrail terminus at the Liverpool end of the line was extended from Liverpool Exchange to underground Liverpool Central. With the closure of Liverpool Exchange terminus station in 1977, the terminus at the Liverpool end of the diesel service was cut back to Kirkby station. Passengers from Manchester alight at Kirkby walk down the same platform boarding a Liverpool bound electric train terminating at Liverpool's underground Central station. The diesel train from Manchester is scheduled to meet a Merseyrail electric train from Liverpool at Kirkby for ease of passenger transfers. A new underground through station was built at Moorfields replacing some of the services of nearby Liverpool Exchange terminus station. At 37 miles (59.5 km) this route is longer than either of the two direct routes. According to National Rail Enquires website the travelling time from end to end would be 1 hour 38 minutes, including the change, compared with around 30 minutes from Lime Street to Manchester Piccadilly. However, for passengers who live near to the stations in the middle section of the line it may prove a quicker journey into Liverpool or Manchester. =Via Ditton Junction= A further southerly route, using what was St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway and Warrington and Stockport Railway, connected Liverpool Lime Street with Manchester Oxford Road via Ditton Junction, Warrington Bank Quay (low level platforms) and Timperley. Part of this route is still used for coal and limestone traffic to Fiddlers Ferry Power Station, but east of Warrington it has been abandoned and now forms part of the Trans Pennine Trail. Fiddlers Ferry Power station is to close by 31 March 2020.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/13/mild-but-windy- winter-was-greenest-ever-for-uk-energy-use What will become of the line between Widnes and Warrington is uncertain. Northern Powerhouse Rail have suggested the line be used to access Liverpool from Manchester.  Timings and line speeds  , the fastest journey times are around half an hour, which is little better than over a century earlier. The fastest recorded run was from Manchester Exchange to Liverpool Lime St in 30 minutes 46 seconds by a 1936 built Jubilee 5707 with 7 coaches. An 1882-built compound steam locomotive was timed on the same route in 38 minutes 18 seconds. Until 1968 trains from Liverpool to Manchester by all 3 routes were scheduled to take 40 minutes and often took less. The southern route via Warrington is now restricted to 85 mph and the northern route via Earlestown to 90 mph, with 75 mph over Chat Moss. Work to four-track the line between Huyton and Roby was completed in October 2017.

Medina was the first developed of the Kwinana suburbs named after ships carrying settlers to the Swan River Colony in 1829 and 1830. arrived at Fremantle on 6 July 1830 with 51 passengers on board. The ship's name Medina is believed to be derived from the River Medina on the Isle of Wight, and was approved as a suburb name in 1953. Streets were named after passengers and crew, such as Pace Road after Captain Walter Pace, and Ridley Green, Ridley Way and Ridley Court after passenger Mary Eliza Ridley. History Medina is a well-established suburb, designed in the early 1950s by Perth's first female town planner, Margaret Feilman. Medina was the first of Kwinana's four 'neighbourhood units' developed to meet the housing needs of the newly established Kwinana industrial area. During the 1950s construction included Australia's largest oil refinery, operated by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later British Petroleum); the Cockburn Cement works (then owned by Rugby Portland Cement); and a BHP blast furnace and steel- rolling mill. In 1963 Alcoa of Australia established an alumina refinery, and in 1967 the CSBP sulphuric acid and superphosphate plants were commissioned. Medina housing was typical for the State Housing Commission (now the Housing Authority) of the era. Most original houses were built with jarrah weatherboard to window height, and asbestos sheeting above, with jarrah frames, floors and stumps. Most lots were or greater in size.

It is a strong oxidizing agent. Preparation Potassium bromate is produced when bromine is passed through a hot solution of potassium hydroxide. This first forms unstable potassium hypobromite, which quickly disproportionates into bromide and bromate: : 3BrO‚àí(aq) ‚Üí 2Br‚àí(aq) + (aq) Electrolysis of potassium bromide solutions will also give bromate. Both processes are analogous to those used in the production of chlorates. Potassium bromate is readily separated from the potassium bromide present in both methods owing to its much lower solubility; when a solution containing potassium bromate and bromide is cooled to 0¬∞C, nearly all bromate will precipitate, while nearly all of the bromide will stay in solution. Uses in baking Potassium bromate is typically used in the United States as a flour improver (E number E924). It acts to strengthen the dough and to allow higher rising. It is an oxidizing agent, and under the right conditions will be completely reacted to a form with a lower oxidation state in baking the bread. However, if too much is added, or if the bread is not baked long enough or not at a high enough temperature, then a residual amount will remain, which may be harmful if consumed. Potassium bromate might also be used in the production of malt barley, for which application the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has prescribed certain safety conditions, including labeling standards for the finished malt barley product.Section 172.730 Potassium Bromate, Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption, US Code of Federal Regulations, US Food and Drug Administration It is a very powerful oxidizer (E¬∞ = 1.5 volts, comparable to potassium permanganate).

Moissaye J. Olgin (New York: International Publishers, 1966), p. 33. Engels praises the historian Wilhelm Zimmermann's book The History of the Great Peasant War (1841‚Äì1843) as \\"the best compilation of factual data\\" regarding the Peasant War of 1525Note 294 contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10, p. 686. and acknowledges that most of the material relating to the peasant revolts and to Thomas M√ºntzer has been taken from Zimmermann's book. The Peasant War in Germany originally appeared in the fifth and sixth issues of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung-Revue, a political economic review edited by Karl Marx in Hamburg, and was later reissued in book forms. Drawing upon the aims and methods of historical materialism, Engels downplays the importance of political and religious causes for the war traditionally cited, focusing instead on material, economic factors. \\"This book,\\" Engels writes in the preface to the second edition, > undertakes ... to prove that the political and religious theories were not > the causes [of the conflict], but the result of that stage of development of > agriculture, industry, land and waterways, commerce and finance, which then > existed in Germany.

Engels details the complex class structure of Germany in the era of the peasant war, and explores the ambiguous role in it of the knights, lesser noblemen whose commitment to preserving their feudal powers overrode their alliances with the peasants. Similarly, Engels offers a scathing critique of Martin Luther as an opportunistic \\"middle-class\\" reformer and a betrayer not just of the revolution but of some of his own best-known Christian tenets: > Luther had given the plebeian movement a powerful weapon‚Äîa translation of > the Bible.

Expressing his belief that Thomas M√ºntzer, a radical supporter of the peasants' overthrow of all feudal structures, was ahead of his time and therefore doomed to defeat, Engels can use language that ignores subtle historical difference.The Peasant War in Germany, trans. Moissaye J. Olgin (New York: International Publishers, 1966), pp. 65‚Äì66. Depending on the historians' own perspective, the war could be interpreted, as Friedrich Engels does, as a case in which an emerging bourgeoisie (the urban class) failed to assert a sense of its own autonomy in the face of princely power, and left the rural classes to their fate.Frederich Engels, The Peasant War in Germany. Originally published 1850; Edition: 3 ‚Äì 2000 (electronic), pp. 59-62. Accessed 15 August 2009. here. Contents =Social classes in the 16th-century Holy Roman Empire= Princes Sixteenth century Germany was part of the Holy Roman Empire, a decentralized entity in which the Holy Roman Emperor himself had little authority outside of his own dynastic lands, which covered only a small fraction of the whole. There were hundreds of largely independent secular and ecclesiastical territories in the empire, most of which were ruled by a noble dynasty (though several dozen were city states). Many were autocratic rulers who barely recognized any other authority within their territories. Princes had the right to levy taxes and borrow money as they saw fit. The growing costs of administration and military upkeep impelled the princes to keep raising their subjects' cost of living. The lesser nobility and the clergy paid no taxes and often supported their local prince. Many towns had privileges that exempted them from paying taxes, and so the bulk of the burden of taxation fell on the peasants. Princes often attempted to force their freer peasants into serfdom through increasing taxes and the introduction of Roman Civil law. Roman Civil law was advantageous to those princes who sought to consolidate their power, because it brought all land into their personal ownership and eliminated the feudal concept of the land as a trust between lord and peasant that conferred rights as well as obligations on the latter. By maintaining the remnants of the ancient law which legitimized their own rule, they not only elevated their wealth and position in the empire through the confiscation of all property and revenues, but also their dominion over their peasant subjects. Under this ancient law, the peasants had little recourse beyond passive resistance. Even so, the prince now had absolute control over all his serfs and their possessions. Uprisings generally remained isolated, unsupported and easily put down until Thomas M√ºntzer and similar radicals began to reject the legitimizing factors of ancient law and invoked the concept of \\"Godly Law\\" as a vehicle for rousing the people. Lesser nobility The evolving military technology of the late medieval period began to render the lesser nobility of knights obsolete. The introduction of military science and the growing importance of gunpowder and infantry lessened the importance of their role as heavy cavalry, as well as reducing the strategic importance of their castles. Their luxurious lifestyle drained what little income they had as prices kept rising. They exercised their ancient rights in order to wring what income they could from their territories. The knights became embittered as they grew progressively impoverished and fell increasingly under the jurisdiction of the princes. Thus these two classes were in constant conflict. The knights also considered the clergy to be an arrogant and superfluous estate, while envying the privileges and wealth that the church statutes secured. In addition, the knights, who were often in debt to the towns, were constantly in conflict with the town patricians. Clergy The clergy, or prelate class, was losing its place as the intellectual authority over all matters within the state. The progress of printing (especially of the Bible) and the expansion of commerce, as well as the spread of renaissance humanism raised literacy rates throughout the Empire. The Catholic monopoly on higher education was accordingly also reduced. Over time, Catholic institutions had slipped into corruption. Clerical ignorance and the abuses of simony and pluralism (holding several offices at once) were rampant. Some bishops, archbishops, abbots and priors were as ruthless in exploiting their subjects as the regional princes. In addition to the sale of indulgences, they set up prayer houses and directly taxed the people. Increased indignation over Church corruption had led the monk Martin Luther to post his 95 Theses on the doors of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany in 1517, as well as impelling other reformers to radically rethink Church doctrine and organization. Patricians As the guilds grew and urban populations rose, the town patricians faced increasing opposition. The patricians consisted of wealthy families that sat alone in the town councils and held all the administrative offices. Like the princes, they could seek to secure revenues from their peasants by any possible means. Arbitrary road, bridge and gate tolls could be instituted at will. They gradually revoked the common lands and made it illegal for a farmer to fish or log wood in what was once land held in common. Guild taxes were exacted. All revenues collected were not subject to formal administration, and civic accounts were neglected. Thus embezzlement and fraud were commonly practiced and the patrician class, bound by family ties, became ever richer and more exploitative. B√ºrgers The town patricians were increasingly criticized by the growing b√ºrger class, which consisted of well-to-do middle-class citizens who often held administrative guild positions or worked as merchants. To the b√ºrgers, their own growing wealth was reason enough to claim the right to control civic administration. They openly demanded a town assembly made up of both patricians and burghers, or at least a restriction of simony and the allocation of several seats to b√ºrgers. The b√ºrgers also opposed the clergy, who they felt had overstepped their bounds and failed to uphold their religious duties. They demanded an end to the clergy‚Äôs special privileges, such as their exemption from taxation, as well as a reduction in their number. The b√ºrger-master (guild master, or artisan) now owned both the workshop and its tools, which he allowed his apprentices to use, and provided the materials that his workers needed to make their products. In exchange, they received payments whose size the b√ºrger determined after taking into account how long their labour had taken, as well as the quality of their workmanship and the quantity of products produced. Journeymen lost the opportunity to rise in the ranks of the guild and were thereby deprived of their civic rights. Plebeians The plebeians comprised the new class of urban workers, journeymen and vagabonds. Ruined petty burghers also joined their ranks. Although technically potential burghers, the journeymen were barred from higher positions by the wealthy families that ran the guilds. Thus their ‚Äútemporary‚Äù position devoid of civic rights tended to become permanent. The plebeians did not have property like ruined burghers or peasants. They were landless, rightless citizens, and a symptom of the decay of feudal society. It was in Thuringia that the revolution which centered around M√ºntzer would give the plebeian working class the greatest expression. They demanded complete social equality as they began to believe, with M√ºntzer's encouragement, that the evolution of their society should be driven by themselves from below, not from above. The authorities hastened to put down such explosive aspirations, which posed the greatest threat to their traditional authority. Peasants The lowest stratum of society continued to be occupied by peasants, who were heavily taxed. In the early 16th century, no peasant could hunt, fish or chop wood freely, as the lords had recently taken these common lands for their own purposes. The lord had the right to use his peasant‚Äôs land as he wished; the peasant could do nothing but watch as his crops were destroyed by wild game and by nobles galloping across his fields in the course of their chivalric hunts. When a peasant wished to marry, he needed not only the lord's permission, but to pay a tax. When the peasant died, the lord was entitled to his best cattle, his best garments and his best tools. The justice system, operated by the clergy or wealthy burgher and patrician jurists, gave the peasant no redress. Generations of traditional servitude and the autonomous nature of the provinces limited peasant insurrections to local areas. The peasant‚Äôs only hope was the unification of aspirations across provincial lines. M√ºntzer was to recognize that the recently diluted class structures provided the lower stratum of society with a greater claim to legitimacy in their revolt, as well as more scope for political and socio- economic gains. =Rise of social conflict= The emergence of the newer classes and their respective interests began to soften the structure of authority of the old feudal system. Increased international trade and industry not only put the princes in conflict with the interests of the growing merchant capitalist class, but also broadened the base of lower-class interests (the peasants plus the new urban workers). The interposition of the burghers and the necessary plebeian class weakened feudal authority, as both these classes opposed the top of the hierarchy while also being in natural opposition to each other. The emergence of the plebeian class strengthened lower-class interests in several ways. Instead of the peasantry being the only oppressed and traditionally servile estate, the plebeians added a new dimension that shared similar class interests, but did so without a history of outright oppression. Opposition to the privileges of the Catholic clergy was rising among several classes in the new late-medieval hierarchy, including the peasantry. Many burghers and nobles also despised the perceived laziness and looseness of clerical life. As members of the more privileged classes by virtue of entrepreneurship and tradition respectively, they felt that the clergy was reaping benefits (such as tax exemption and ecclesiastical tithes) to which they were not entitled. When the situation suited, even princes would abandon Catholicism in order to gain political and financial independence and increase their power within their territories. After thousands of articles of complaints were compiled and presented by the lower classes in numerous towns and villages to no avail, the revolt broke out. The parties split into three distinct groups. The Catholic camp consisted of the clergy plus those patricians and princes who resisted any opposition to the Catholic-centred social order. The moderate reforming party consisted mainly of burghers and princes. The burghers saw an opportunity to gain power in the urban councils, as Luther‚Äôs proposed reformed church would be highly centralized within the towns, as well as condemning the nepotistic practices by which the patricians held a firm grip on the bureaucracy. Similarly, the princes stood to gain additional autonomy not only from the Catholic emperor Charles V, but from the demands of the Catholic Church in Rome. Plebeians, peasants and those sympathetic to their cause made up the third camp, which was led by preachers like Thomas M√ºntzer. This camp wished to break the shackles of late medieval society and forge a new one in the name of God. Germany's peasants and plebeians compiled lists of articles outlining their complaints. The famous 12 Articles of the Black Forest were ultimately adopted as the definitive set of grievances. The articles' statement of social, political and economic grievances in the increasingly popular Protestant movement unified the population in the massive uprising that broke out first in Lower Swabia in 1524, then quickly spread to other parts of Germany. =Ultimate failure of the rebellion= The peasant movement ultimately failed, with cities and nobles making separate peaces with the princely armies that restored the old order in a frequently still-harsher incarnation under the nominal overlordship of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, represented in German affairs by his younger brother Ferdinand. The religious dissident Martin Luther, already condemned as a heretic by the 1521 Edict of Worms and accused at the time of fomenting the strife, rejected the demands of the rebels and upheld the right of Germany's rulers to suppress the uprisings. Luther based his attitude on the peasant rebellion on St. Paul's doctrine of Divine Right of Kings in his epistle to the , which says that all authorities are appointed by God, and should not be resisted. His former follower Thomas M√ºntzer, on the other hand, came to the fore as a radical agitator in Thuringia. =Anabaptists= On December 27, 1521, three Zwickau prophets, both influenced by and influencing Thomas M√ºntzer, appeared in Wittenberg from Zwickau: Thomas Dreschel, Nicolas Storch and Mark Thomas St√ºbner. Luther's reform was not radical enough for them. Like the Roman Catholic Church, Luther practiced infant baptism, which the Anabaptists considered to be \\"neither scriptural nor primitive, nor fulfilling the chief conditions of admission into a visible brotherhood of saints, to wit, repentance, faith, spiritual illumination and free surrender of self to Christ.\\" The reformist theologian and associate of Luther, Philipp Melanchthon, who was powerless against the enthusiasts with whom his co- reformer Andreas Karlstadt sympathized, appealed to Luther, who was still hiding in the Wartburg. Luther was cautious in not condemning the new doctrine out of hand, but advised Melanchthon to treat its supporters gently and to test their spirits, in case they should be of God. There was confusion in Wittenberg, whose schools and university had sided with the \\"prophets\\" and were closed. From this arises the allegation that the Anabaptists were enemies of learning, which is contradicted by the fact that two of them, Haetzer and Denck, produced and printed the first German translation of the Hebrew prophets in 1527. The first leaders of the movement in Z√ºrich‚ÄîConrad Grebel, Felix Manz, George Blaurock, Balthasar Hubmaier--were learned in Greek, Latin and Hebrew. On March 6, 1522, Luther returned to Wittenberg, where he interviewed the prophets, scorned their \\"spirits\\", banished them from the city, and had their adherents ejected from Zwickau and Erfurt. Denied access to the churches, the latter preached and celebrated the sacrament in private houses. Having been driven from the cities, they swarmed across the countryside. Compelled to leave Zwickau, M√ºntzer visited Bohemia, lived for two years at Alltstedt in Thuringia, and in 1524 spent some time in Switzerland. During this period he proclaimed his revolutionary religious and political doctrines with increasing vehemence, and, so far as the lower orders were concerned, with growing success. The Peasants' War began chiefly as a revolt against feudal oppression, but under the leadership of M√ºntzer it became a war against all constituted authorities in a forcible attempt to establish M√ºntzer's ideal of a Christian commonwealth based on absolute equality and the community of goods. The total defeat of the rebels at Frankenhausen (May 15, 1525), followed by the execution of M√ºntzer and several other leaders, proved to be a merely temporary check on the Anabaptist movement. Scattered throughout Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands were zealous propagandists whose teachings many were prepared to follow as soon as another leader emerged.

They first settled in Intramuros, and then in Quezon City. During this time, the Ortigas family was under their spiritual guidance. In grateful appreciation, the Ortigas family offered the Fathers assistance and facilities. With this, the Order entered into a contract with the Ortigas family, and acquired a three-hectare lot along Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong. In May 1957 Reverend Father Adolfo de Echavarri, the Superior of the Capuchins, laid a cornerstone for the new building - an L-shaped structure, a combined parish and school. On October 4, 1958, the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, the new parish was opened by Rufino J. Cardinal Santos. In 1959 Lourdes School of Mandaluyong started with a hundred students in Grades One to Four, with Fr. Gregorio Gioccochea, OFM Cap. as the first headmaster. The 1970s saw the construction of the St. Francis Theatre, the new High School Building, a new canteen, an air-conditioned library, and a 521-seat air-conditioned auditorium. In July 1986 a second floor for the High School Building, and several additional facilities, were built. The old gymnasium was later moved to the Pax Et Bonum Building, and inaugurated on February 8, 1991. The Pax Et Bonum Building was then clustered with the building houses of Prep and the Grade One classrooms, Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE) workshops and classes, the Guidance Office, the PTA Office, and the Faculty Room.

Early years Alexander Glikberg was born into a Jewish family of pharmacists in Odessa, Russian Empire (currently in Ukraine) on October 13 N.S. 1880. The Glikberg family was not a happy one: his mother suffered from hysteria and children were bad for her nerves; his father often became violent and severely punished his children. It so happened that among the five Glikberg children there were two Alexanders (or Sashas for short), the blond Sasha was usually called White Sasha (–ë–µ–ª—ã–π –°–∞—à–∞ in Russian) and the brunet Black Sasha (–ß—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–π –°–∞—à–∞ in Russian). The Glikberg children could not enter a gymnasium because of the quota restriction for enrollment of Jews in schools in Imperial Russia. Eventually the Glikbergs solved the problem by baptizing themselves and their children. After this, in 1889, the children entered the Odessa gymnasium. Alexander found studying in the gymnasium akin to boring bureaucratic service. At the age of fifteen he ran away from home. For some time he lived with his aunt in Saint Petersburg, but after being expelled from a Saint Petersburg gymnasium for failing algebra, he was left homeless and without money. Neither his parents nor other relatives responded to his letters and pleas for help. Fortunately for Alexander, one of his stories was published by the journalist Alexander Yablonovsky in the popular newspaper Syn Otechestva. The article was read by K.K. Rochet, a French-Russian living in Zhitomir, who decided to adopt the boy. Alexander entered a Zhitomir gymnasium, from which he was also eventually expelled after a conflict with the principal. Alexander served two years in the Army and then got a job as a customs officer in the village of Novosiltsy on the border with Austria-Hungary. In 1904, he returned to his adoptive family in Zhitomir and worked as a journalist for the magazine Volynsky Vestnik. The magazine went bankrupt within two months, and Alexander decided to continue his journalistic career in Saint Petersburg. Poet On moving to Saint Petersburg, he worked an administrative job for the Warsaw ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway. There he met his wife, Maria Ivanovna Vasilieva, who was his manager at the railroad. She was a few years older than he, better educated, and richer. In Chorny's verse, marriage to a co-worker was often noted as the worst fate for a person. Despite this, their marriage seemed to have been a happy one and lasted their whole lives. They spent their honeymoon in Italy, in 1905. After returning to Saint Petersburg, Alexander published a collection of verse titled Nonsense (–ß–µ–ø—É—Ö–∞) in the magazine Zritel using the nom de plume Sasha Chorny. The magazine was closed by the government as a result of these verses, but their effect on the readers was huge. The verses were distributed throughout the country, rewritten by hand, and Chorny soon became a popular and sought after author. Between 1906 and 1907, Sasha Chorny lived in Germany and studied at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg. In 1908, he returned to Saint Petersburg and wrote for the popular magazine Satirikon to wide popular acclaim. \\"When somebody gets an issue of the magazine, the first things he looks for are the Sasha Chorny poems.

Among the admirers of his verses was Vladimir Mayakovsky, who knew many of his poems by heart and often recited them. In 1910, Sasha Chorny published his book of verses, Satires, followed in 1911 by another one, Satires and Lyrics. He also published the children's books Tuk-Tuk (Knock- Knock) in 1913 and Live ABC (1914). War and emigration During World War I, Sasha Chorny served as a private at a field hospital. After the October Revolution, he emigrated to Vilnius, then to Germany, where he worked for the Berlin magazine Fire-bird, then to France, where he worked for the Parisian Russian newspaper. In 1923, he published his third book of verses Thirst. In 1927, he was a founder of a Russian colony in the village La Favi√®re in Provence. In emigration, he wrote the poem Who lives well in emigration (–ö–æ–º—É –≤ —ç–º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∂–∏—Ç—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ, 1931-1932) and prose Non-serious stories (–ù–µ—Å–µ—Ä—å–µ–∑–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã, 1928) Soldiers' tales (–°–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∏, published in 1933).

People working in this field ‚Äì especially in establishments such as restaurants ‚Äì are commonly called \\"chefs\\" or \\"cooks\\", although, at its most general, the terms \\"culinary artist\\" and \\"culinarian\\" are also used. Table manners (\\"the table arts\\") are sometimes referred to as a culinary art. Expert chefs are required to have knowledge of food science, nutrition and diet and are responsible for preparing meals that are as pleasing to the eye as they are to the palate. After restaurants, their primary places of work include delicatessens and relatively large institutions such as hotels and hospitals. History The origins of culinary began with primitive humans roughly 2 million years ago. There are various theories as to how early humans used fire to cook meat. According to anthropologist Richard Wrangham, author of Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human, primitive humans simply tossed a raw hunk of meat into the flames and watched it sizzle. Another theory claims humans may first have savoured roasted meat by chance when the flesh of a beast killed in a forest fire was found to be more appetizing and easier to chew and digest than the conventional raw meat. Culinary techniques improved with the introduction of earthenware and stoneware, the domestication of livestock, and advancements in agriculture. In early civilizations, the primary employers of professional chefs were kings, aristocrats, or priests. The divide between professional chefs cooking for the wealthy and peasants cooking for their families engendered the development of many cuisines. A great deal of the study of culinary arts in Europe was organized by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a man famous for his quote \\"Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are\\", which has since been mistranslated and oversimplified into \\"You are what you eat\\". Other people helped to parse out the different parts of food science and gastronomy. Over time, increasingly deeper and more detailed studies into foods and the culinary arts has led to a greater wealth of knowledge. In Asia, a similar path led to a separate study of the culinary arts, which later essentially merged with the Western counterpart. In the modern international marketplace, there is no longer a distinct divide between Western and Eastern foods. Culinary arts students today, generally speaking, are introduced to the different cuisines of many different cultures from around the world. The culinary arts, in the Western world, as a craft and later as a field of study, began to evolve at the end of the Renaissance period. Prior to this, chefs worked in castles, cooking for kings and queens, as well as their families, guests, and other workers of the castle. As Monarchical rule became phased out as a modality, the chefs took their craft to inns and hotels. From here, the craft evolved into a field of study. Before cooking institutions, professional cooks were mentors for individual students who apprenticed under them. In 1879, the first cooking school was founded in the United States: the Boston Cooking School. This school standardized cooking practices and recipes, and laid the groundwork for the culinary arts schools that would follow.  Tools and techniques  Image of a chef preparing food An integral part of the culinary arts are the tools, known as cooking or kitchen utensils, that are used by both professional chefs and home cooks alike. Professionals in the culinary arts often call these utensils by the French term \\"batterie de cuisine\\".Griswold, Madge. \\"Utensils, Cooking\\". Encyclopedia of Food and Culture, edited by Solomon H. Katz, vol. 3, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003, pp. 472-476. Gale eBooks. Accessed 25 Sept. 2019. These tools vary in materials and use. Cooking implements are made with anything from wood, glass, various types of metals, to the newer silicone and plastic that can be seen in many kitchens today. Within the realm of the culinary arts, there is a wide array of different cooking techniques that originate from various cultures and continue to develop over time as these techniques are shared between cultures and progress with new technology. Different cooking techniques require the use of certain tools, foods and heat sources in order to produce a specific desired result. The professional kitchen may utilize certain techniques that a home cook might not, such as the use of an expensive professional grill but, cooking methods of various kinds can be found in any kitchen at virtually any point in modern human history.Symons, Michael. \\"Cooking\\". Encyclopedia of Food and Culture, edited by Solomon H. Katz, vol. 1, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003, pp. 458-462. Gale eBooks. Accessed 27 Oct. 2019. Professional study Modern culinary arts students study many different aspects of food. Specific areas of study include butchery, chemistry and thermodynamics, visual presentation, food safety, human nutrition and physiology, international history, the manufacture of food items (such as the milling of wheat into flour or the refining of cane plants into crystalline sucrose), and many others. Training in culinary arts is possible in most countries around the world. Usually at tertiary level (university). With institutions government funded, privately funded or commercial.

History  Haebangchon was originally the site of a shooting field used by the 20th division of the Japanese military. A government office of the U.S. army took over the area after liberation in 1945. However, its control was limited and the area was settled by refugees from the North and returning citizens (Í∑ÄÌôòÎèôÌè¨). It was the origin of the shanty town (ÌåêÏûêÏ¥å) and became a magnet for those who returned after liberation but had lost their hometowns.  Geography  Heabangchon is a small village in Yongsan-gu, in the center of Seoul, South Korea. It is accessible by public transport: it is close to Noksapyung Station of Line 6 of Seoul Metro. Most of the Yongsan-2-ga postal area and a part of Yongsan-1-ga are included. It is overlooked by the Namsan Mountain and is south of the Namsan Tower.  Culture  Haebangchon is a multi-cultural neighborhood in Seoul, aligned with Itaewon and Gyeonglidan-gil. According to 2013 statistics, 1,065 out of 12,648 residents of Yongsan-2-ga are foreign. This can also be seen in and around the Sinheung-Ro area. Studios, art spaces, and food outlet from many cuisines line the main roads, and a few newer shops have appeared in smaller and more residential side streets. There is a convergence between residence and commercial space in HBC; however, the buildings have always had the first floor as either parking or a business space for many years in HBC. In 2018 Minerva Schools at KGI opened a campus in Haebangchon bringing with it around 200 international students to live in the area from September to December.

Banjup is located on the Jandakot Water Mound. As part of the Western Australian State Government water resource protection policy development over the Jandakot Water Mound is limited to reduce the possibility of contamination from runoff from properties. As a consequence the number of animals per property is limited by the City of Cockburn zoning policies (for example 1 horse per 2 ha property - exemptions apply for established properties with livestock). Much of the Jandakot Regional Parkhttp://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/park/jandakot is located within Banjup. History  Banjup was named in the mid-1950s from the lake in the district. During the survey of the Jandakot Agricultural Area in 1889, surveyor James Oxley recorded the name of Lake Bangup. A siding on the Fremantle-Armadale railway line was named Banjupp in 1907 and this name was altered to Banjup in the 1930s. In 2016, the northern portion of Banjup (extending above Armadale Road) was turned into a new suburb, named Treeby. Banjup Memorial Park  Banjup Memorial Park was established after World War I. A gum tree was planted for each of the fourteen men from the district who had enlisted. If any of the trees dies, another is planted in its place. A plaque naming the men is displayed at the park and another is held at the Azelia Ley Homestead.http://www.azelialeymuseum.com.au/ The plaque names the men who returned safely as well as those who were wounded or killed. Cockburn RSL maintains Banjup Memorial Park.http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/6e299703-f0ac-46d3-b596-96de578c46dd Of the 14 Banjup men who served in the war, six were killed in action, four were wounded and the remaining four returned to Australia. This memorial records the highest \\"Killed in Action\\" and \\"Wounded\\" on a percentage basis, than any other war memorial in Western Australia.http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/conflict/ww1/display/60069-banjup- memorial-park Community group  The Banjup Residents Grouphttp://banjup.webs.com/ was established in 2010 to advocate on behalf of Banjup residents to local, state and federal governments. Approximately 45% of Banjup residents are members.

They are said to be yokai that live in zashiki storage rooms, and they would perform pranks, and those that see one would be visited with good fortune. There are also legends of how they would bring fortune to families. They are also known from Kunio Yanagita's T≈çno Monogatari, Ishigami Mond≈ç, and stories about them appear in the 17th and 18th chapters of the T≈çno Monogatari and the 87th chapter titled \\"Zashiki-warashi\\" of the T≈çno Monogatari Sh≈´i. In the 17th chapter, it is written \\"families with whom this god dwells are freely able to prosper at will\\" (kono kami no yadoritamafu ihe ha f≈´ki jizai nari to ifu koto nari) and \\"zashiki-warashi are also called \\". In recent years, television programs and magazines have reported about various Iwate Prefecture ryokan where it is said to be possible to see a zashiki- warashi such as the Ryokuf≈´s≈ç, the Sugawara Bekkan, and the Warabe. Concept Reports have mostly been in the Iwate Prefecture, but there are also some scattered across the Aomori Prefecture, the Miyagi Prefecture, the Akita Prefecture, and others in the T≈çhoku region. Generally the beings have a red face, hair that hangs down, and the appearance of that of a five- or six- year-old child, but, depending on the house that they settle in, age range reports range from a minimum of around three years and a maximum of around 15 years. They have a bob haircut or very short cropped hair. Both males and females have been seen, and the male ones are said to wear blackish clothes with a kasuri or striped pattern, and the females are said to wear a red chanchanko, kosode, and sometimes a furisode. It is also said that there are some whose appearance is unclear, making their gender unknown. Sometimes multiple beings would settle in a house at once, such as a boy and a girl. There are also some legends telling of ones that look like a black beast, and others that look like a warrior. They like causing mischief, so they are said to leave ash or bleaching powder on top of little footprints and at nighttime, they are said to make sounds like that of a revolving spinning wheel, and they would also make sounds in an inner room making sounds like that of a kagura performance. There are also tales told about how when someone in the family is sewing alone, there would be sounds similar to the rustling of papers or someone snorting, and when the wooden door is opened there would be no one there. It is also said that at night, they would do pranks such as riding on top of guest room futons and turning over the pillows in order to not let the person sleep, and when attempts are made to stop it, it would be too strong and powerful for anyone to even affect its actions. Sometimes they also play with children. In Iwate, there are legends of how the zashiki-warashi of a shrine at Hayachine would follow a shrine visitor who came from afar and follow them into different lands. There are also legends of how the zashiki- warashi would teach the nursery rhyme of Iwate to the children of those lands. In Gonohe, Aomori Prefecture, there is a legend of how when a new house is built, a zashiki-warashi can be called into it by burying a golden ball under the floors. There are theories about how they cannot be seen by anyone other than members of the family or how they can only be seen by children but not adults. There are stories about how when adults counted children, there would be one more person than there was originally, but as adults do not understand what zashiki-warashi are, they would not know who is the extra person. Stories like these frequently appear as themes in literature. Relation to family prosperity An example of a very characteristic folk belief is that families with a zashiki-warashi would prosper and families whose zashiki-warashi have gone away would decline. This aspect shows that zashiki-warashi are like gods of fortune or protective spirits that rule over a family's prosperity and decline. In the T≈çno Monogatari, there are tales such as one telling about how a family was wiped out by foodborne illness after its zashiki-warashi left it and another tale about how in the Iide section of the village of Tsuchibuchi, Iwate Prefecture (now part of the city of T≈çno), a wealthy family's zashiki- warashi was shot by a child with a bow and arrow causing it to leave the family, resulting in the family's fortunes decline. There is also the view that the way families would decline after a zashiki-warashi leaves it and the way families would prosper after a binb≈çgami leaves it are related. There is the theory that a white zashiki-warashi is a sign of good things to come and the sight of a red one (with a red face, red clothes, and a red bucket in its hands) is a sign that a zashiki-warashi would leave the family leading to bad things to come. There are also examples where a family that saw a red-clothed one all died from foodborne illness. Customs Zashiki-warashi are there in inner guest rooms (zashiki), and their existence is said to have an effect on the direction the family goes in, so there are some families that treat them hospitably and offer them meals every day. They are said to like azuki meshi, so there are families that offer some azuki meshi every day, and if it is not eaten, it is said to be an omen for the family's decline. Zashiki-warashi generally work the same way as having kitsune or having inugami, but the difference between them and zashiki-warashi is that for a zashiki-warashi is never considered a nuisance, and in fact they are even protected as gods, and a family that has a zashiki-warashi is usually treated by other people with respect. In the area around the city of Ninohe, there is a custom of making up a room with desserts and toys left inside for a child who had died or was killed as an infant (infanticide), and giving worship to this child, a custom that remains to the present day. There is also a custom of making a room that a child would like in order to make a zashiki-warashi stay at the house in order to bring the family prosperity. According to the Ton≈ç Monogatari, the house of a certain wealthy family in the town of Tsuchibuchi had a small space that was called the \\"Zat≈ç room\\", and it is considered to be the room that would be used to await the Zat≈ç (a kind of member of the builder's guild such as the t≈çd≈çza or members of related groups such as the Anma, moxibustion practitioners, and members of the biwa h≈çshi, among other organizations) every time a banquet was called, but the literary researcher Sukeyuki Miura surmises that perhaps this room was used to give worship to the god's protective spirit. Kinds Zashiki-warashi have various regional names such as zashiki- warabe (), zashiki-warashi (), zashiki-bokko (), okura-bokko (), zashiki-koz≈ç (), and karako-warashi. The name \\"zashiki-bokko\\" is used in the inland regions of Iwate, and this name was also used in the writings of Kenji Miyazawa. There are also regions and legends where zashiki-warashi have rankings, and in the Jipp≈çan Y≈´reki Zakki (), there are statements about zashiki-warashi seen in the area of Inase, Esashi, Iwate Prefecture (now Esashi District, ≈åsh≈´, and that zashiki-warashi in a home's dirt floor are called kometsuki-warashi, notabariko, usutsuriko, among other names, and the white, most beautiful zashiki-warashi that is in the inner zashiki is called the ch≈çpirako. Among these, there are some that have no influence on the family's fortunes and instead merely move around the house making noises, and there are not merely a few that have been deemed creepy. There are also some that have arms that are long and thin like vines, which they use to beckon people as well as warn of disasters like floods and tsunami, and these can be called hosode (Á¥∞Êâã, \\"thin arms\\") or hosode nagate (Á¥∞ÊâãÈï∑Êâã, \\"thin arms long arms\\"). There is a story telling of how \\"a poor man once threw firewood into the water, was invited into the dragon palace, and received as a gift an ugly-looking but fortune- bringing ry≈´ky≈´-warashi (dragon palace child)\\". There are also zashiki-warashi that stay in the doz≈ç, and they are called kura-warashi or kura-bokko (child of the storehouse). According to the essay \\"Zashiki-warashi no Hanashi\\" (, \\"Stories about Zashiki-warashi\\") by the folklorist Kizen Sasaki, in a certain home in the aforementioned village of Tsuchibuchi, there is a kabukire-warashi (tree stump child) that lives in the \\"Mada no Ki\\" (meaning \\"Bodhi tree\\"). It is said to take on the appearance of a child and sneak into the family's zashiki to perform pranks on the family's daughter, as well as take on an appearance with a red face and play on walnut trees where the tree splits into three. It has also been interpreted to be a spirit of this Mada no Ki. Despite there being many legends of the zashiki-warashi in the T≈çhoku region, there are fewer in Akita Prefecture; this is said to be because Akita has the sankichi oni, so lower-class y≈çkai would not enter Akita. Origins The money spirit from the \\"Hinpuku-ron\\" story in the Ugetsu Monogatari by Ueda Akinari Kizen Sasaki noted that perhaps they are the spirits of children who were crushed to death and buried at the home. In the T≈çhoku region, infanticide was called usugoro (, or \\"mortar kill\\"), and it is said that children who were killed this way to reduce the number of mouths to feed would be killed by being crushed by a stone mortar and there was a custom of burying them in the dirt floor room (doma) or in the kitchen. It is said that the spirits of such children would on rainy days walk around outer edges shaking and frightening the guests, which is said to be seen to resemble deeds similar to that of a zashiki-warashi. The aforementioned notabariko and usu-tsuki warashi are seen to be lower ranking among the zashiki-warashi, and the former would peek out from the inner dirt floor (doma) room and crawl around while the latter would use a mortar to make a sound. Due to such acts, it is sometimes suggested that these kinds of zashiki-warashi have a relation to the fact that the location where the infantide happened is in the dirt floor (doma) room or underneath a mortar. In addition to this relation to infanticide, the fact that the zashiki-warashi are in both old homes and are often mentioned in relation to legends about how after a visiting Buddhist pilgrim from outside the village was killed, the family of the home came to ruin, it has been suggested that these zashiki-warashi are signs of the dark undersides of the village's community. In the by the author Sadako Takahashi, there are also stories about zashiki-warashi that came about from a curse that resulted from carpenters and tatami makers that were unable to do their construction jobs in comfort, and it is said that there were rituals of taking a doll that had a bit of its wood peeled off and inserting it between the pillars and beams. There are also many theories that their true identity is that of a kappa, and there are stories of a zashiki-warashi being a kappa that lived in the depths who would rise up and go into a nearby home to do pranks, as well as stories of zashiki-warashi that were kappa that have settled into a home. Concerning why zashiki-warashi look like children, seeing how in Buddhism there are g≈çh≈ç-warashi (wrathful gods that protect Buddhism and take on the appearance of a child), there is the theory that they come from folk beliefs in how children connected gods and humans, as well as the theory that the appearance of a child embodies divinity. In Kunio Yanagita's view, just as the g≈çh≈ç-warashi were called forth from the heavens by high priests, the protective spirits of Buddhism and folk mikos are related to the faith in giving respect to the freshness of the spirits of young leaves, and this is related to the faith in the zashiki-warashi who became protective spirits of a home in order to will divinity to humans. In folkloristics, after Yanagita also, there has been debate on subjects such as the relation to Okunai-sama and the relation of children that come from another realm such as the Ry≈´gy≈´- warashi (dragon palace warashi). Also, the folklorist Kazuhiko Komatsu views warashi (children) from the point of view of cultural anthropology, and regarding the question of the fortune within homes and the movement of wealth within a village, he notes that zashiki-warashi have almost all their characteristics in common with animal spirit possession such as izuna-tsukai (\\"weasel-using\\"). From an analysis of the supremacy and inferiority within the community of families with a spirit haunting them, he notes that zashiki- warashi have been used as a basis for explaining changes in fortunes within folk society, especially for old homes and families. In Ueda Akinari's late Edo-period yomihon the Ugetsu Monogatari, in the story \\"Hinpuku-ron\\" (Theory of Wealth and Poverty), in Mutsu Province (now Aomori Prefecture), in a certain home of a warrior family, a spirit of money appears in the form of an old man going by the name of \\"≈ågon no Seirei\\" (\\"golden spirit\\") who said \\"I'm glad you treat money as something important to you, so I came to tell a story\\", but the doctor of letters Masamichi Abe suggests that perhaps this is an older, more prototypical type of zashiki-warashi. Legends after the war To the people of T≈çhoku, the zashiki-warashi was certainly not a legend that came around after the war, and tales of zashiki-warashi were told even in the times of Meiji, Sh≈çwa, and beyond. According to Kunio Yanagita's Y≈çkai Dangi (), it is said that in the year 1910 or Meiji 43 around the month of July, in the village of Tsuchibuchi (now T≈çno, Iwate Prefecture) in Kamihei District, Rikuch≈´, a zashiki-warashi appeared at a school that was visible only to the first year students and not to the older students and adults. Certain ryokan that have continued to be managed in the Sh≈çwa and Heisei periods and beyond such as the Ryokuf≈´s≈ç at the Kindaichi Onsen in Iwate Prefecture, the Sugawara Bekkan, and the Warabe both in Tenjin village in Morioka Prefecture are known to be lodges where a zashiki-warashi dwells; there have been tales of guests who saw zashiki-warashi, heard footsteps, were physically touched. However, unlike in the usual legends of zashiki-warashi, the one at Ryokuf≈´s≈ç is considered to be an ancestor that died from an illness and became a protective spirit. Close to the Warabe, there is a Hayachine Shrine that was opened more than 1200 years ago, and it is said that since there have been festivals for offering prayers to zashiki-warashi ever since the establishment of the Warabe, the shrine's zashiki-warashi goes to the Warabe. The zashiki-warashi of the Sugawara Bekkan was originally a god of fire of the Edo period that protected the proprietress's original home from fire, and it is said to have followed this proprietress when she married into the family of this establishment. There have also been tales about how guests to this ryokan have been successful in their marriage and jobs. Similar tales across Japan Similar to the zashiki-warashi are the zashiki-b≈çzu of Kadotani, T≈çt≈çmi Province (now Shizuoka Prefecture) and the akashaguma of Tokushima. Near one of the inner temples of the Kotohira-g≈´ in Shikoku, it is said that at nighttime an \\"akashaguma\\" appears from a butsudan. \\"Akashaguma\\" refers to the fur of a bear that has been stained red, and it is said that a little childlike being wearing this would tickle the old woman owner of this house every night. In the former Higashiyatsuhiro District in Yamanashi Prefecture, it is said that there is an okura-b≈çzu (, \\"warehouse bonze\\") that stays within the warehouse, and this is thought to be a type of zashiki-warashi. In Ishikawa Prefecture, there is the makuragaeshi and it is said that if one sleeps in the zashiki of a certain house, especially if one wields two swords, has hair that stands up, wears western clothing, and puts on a haughty face, then one would get dragged into a neighboring room. The zashiki-warashi of Shirotori, ≈åkawa District, Kagawa Prefecture (now part of Higashikawa), is said to appear as a little girl who is called oshobo due to the small, slight (shobo-shobo in Japanese) way it hangs, and sometimes it is said to be invisible to the members of the house, while other times it is said to be visible only to the members of this house. In addition, in Hokkaido there is the ainukaisei said to attack people in their homes while they sleep, and in the Okinawa Prefecture there is a y≈çkai called the akagantaa said to play pranks on people in their homes while they sleep, and sometimes these are interpreted to be the same kind of beings as zashiki-warashi. The folklorist Shinobu Orikuchi enumerates examples such as the okunai-sama, the zashiki- b≈çzu, the akashaguma, the kijimuna of Okinawa, gaataro of Iki, etc., and sees in them examples of tales of a faithful spirit that came from another land to do work for a certain family whose disappearance would result in the decline of the family. He notes how zashiki-warashi do not descend into the garden and suggests that this is related to how performing arts in the past had a division between \\"garden\\", \\"zashiki\\", and \\"stage\\". Etymology The name breaks down to zashiki (Japanese: ), a sitting room or parlor, usually with tatami flooring, and warashi (Japanese: ), an archaic term for a child, used particularly in the northeast of Japan. Description The appearance of this spirit is that of a five- or six-year-old child with bobbed hair and a red face. Zashiki-warashi can be found in well-maintained and preferably large old houses. It is said that once a zashiki warashi inhabits a house, it brings the residence great fortune; on the other hand, should a zashiki-warashi depart, the domain soon falls into a steep decline. As the zashiki warashi is child- like in nature, it is prone to playing harmless pranks and occasionally causing mischief. They are known for running around and making noise, even adjusting the bedding of overnight guests. Sometimes they leave little footsteps in ashes. There are different variations as to who can see the zashiki-warashi; usually this is limited to inhabitants of the house, sometimes to children. Y≈çkai similar to zashiki-warashi in other parts of Japan include: the makuragaeshi in Ishikawa Prefecture‚Äîanother creature which alters bedding; the ainukaisei in Hokkaido; and the akagantƒÅ found in Okinawa. The Ryokuf≈´s≈ç in Kindaichi Onsen, which burned down on October 4, 2009, was famed for its zashiki warashi. Sightings By the end of November 2015, a mirrored website offered video footage from a home video camera in Japan. It captured the image of what appears to be a girl wearing a kimono walking in the house. Her body is translucent and can walk through walls. It is believed that she was a zashiki-warashi.

It is located within the City of Cockburn and its postcode is 6163. History The existence of the lake was first reported by Augustus Gregory during a survey of George Robb's land in May 1842. Gregory recorded the Aboriginal name of the lake as Walubup. During the following year, Benedict von Bibra, surveying his own selection on the southern shores of the lake, recorded the name as Walliabup and the latter version was used exclusively on maps for more than half a century. Benedict von Bibra In the summer of 1843, Benedict von Bibra (son of Franz Ludwig von Bibra) bought land at the edge of a wide depression to use as a camping place to shorten the trip between his two carpentry businesses in Perth and Fremantle. He apparently assessed from the stringybark trees that the basin would become a lake in winter of a depth of seven to eight feet. He proved correct.The Von Bibra Story Lois Nyman and Graeme von Bibra, November 1996, Foot & Playsted Pty Ltd., Launceston In 1877, it was found the von Bibra's association with Lake Walliabup was apparently still recalled by locals who referred to the feature as Bibra's Lake. This alternative name was added to plans and, in 1967, adopted in place of the Aboriginal name. In 1898 Bibra Lake was reserved for recreation and all applications to lease land were strenuously opposed by the Fremantle District Roads Board, which was given control of the reserve in 1902. Tearooms were erected and the Reserve became a popular venue for picnics and sports gatherings.Cockburn: The Making of a Community Michael Berson, 1978, Town of Cockburn, = AWAS Camp = During World War II, there was a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed at Bibra Lake, along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti- Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service, performing important home defence duties to free up more men for front line fighting. The camp was dismantled immediately after the end of the war, and all its buildings and materials sold at auction. The camp was rediscovered in 2015 by members of the community, and is currently threatened by the proposed Roe Highway extension. Geography It is bounded by the Roe Highway reservation to the north, Stock Road to the west, the Kwinana Freeway to the east and the freight rail line to the south. Bibra Lake is the fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake contains two electric insect traps designed to reduce the number of mosquitoes in the area. Around the lake is a cycle way, which provides access to bird hides. Facilities The majority of the suburb, which is not part of the Beeliar Regional Park contains a major light industrial area, with businesses such as Amcor. Bibra Lake is the location for several major private recreation facilities, including Adventure World theme park, a bungee jumping tower, Cockburn Ice Arena, paintball and laser tag operations. Bibra Lake also has a Waldorf primary school and a Montessori primary school. The manufacturing facilities and headquarters for OKA Australia are in Bibra Lake.

Life and times Born in Esquel, Chubut Province, Acevedo moved to Pico Truncado in 1958. He became a lawyer and married, having three children. He was elected mayor of Pico Truncando in 1983, serving until 1987 when he became a provincial deputy. In 1991 he returned to be mayor. From 1995 to 1999, Acevedo was a national deputy, and became vice-governor of Santa Cruz Province under then-governor N√©stor Kirchner. In 2001 he was elected once again to Congress. Acevedo was appointed Secretary of Intelligence by President Eduardo Duhalde, serving from 2002 to mid-2003. He was confirmed by President N√©stor Kirchner, but later resigned to take up the post of Governor of Santa Cruz Province, swapping positions with H√©ctor Icazuriaga. He was elected with almost 75% of the popular vote.La Naci√≥n Acevedo resigned as governor in March 2006 citing personal reasons. However, his resignation came after clashes with the national government and amid controversy over police brutality in repressing the Las Heras riot and a corruption scandal involving the family of President Kirchner. The President had himself been governor of Santa Cruz and there had been allegations that public contracts were granted based on bribes and kick-backs. Members of his family held senior positions and Acevedo retained Carlos Kirchner as his provincial minister of works. He was prevented from sacking Carlos Kirchner, allegedly due to interference from Buenos Aires.Hacer A judge, the President's nephew, declined to continue the investigation and Acevedo was replaced by Carlos Sancho, vice-governor and employer of the President's son. It was widely speculated at the time that Acevedo resigned due to Presidential interference, in particular with oil and privatisation policy,La Naci√≥n and he has subsequently become a vocal, if equivocal, opponent of his former mentor and patron.Diario Perfil He has set up a political faction, the Santa Cruz Coalition (Convocatoria Santacruce√±a), gathering together Peronists and others opposed to the Front for Victory of Kirchner and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner.√Åmbito Financiero Clar√≠n Several provincial deputies and former provincial ministers joined the team. Following his reappearance on the political scene, there was speculation that Acevedo would run as running mate to Elisa Carri√≥ or Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√° in the 2007 Presidential elections, but he ruled himself out at an early stage.Clar√≠n His coalition, by now called 'New Movement' (Nuevo Movimiento) backed UCR Eduardo Costa for Governor of Santa Cruz, who was defeated by Kirchner's candidate Daniel Peralta in 2007, although the different opposition parties within the Change to Grow coalition fell out over the placings on the regional list for national deputies in the election. Nevertheless, Acevedo's team largely collaborated with opposition forces in municipal and provincial elections across Santa Cruz.

History The suburb takes its name from the lake, Lake Coogee, in the area, which translates to \\"Body of water\\" in the native Aboriginal Nyoongar language. Originally this lake was named Lake Munster after Prince William, the Earl of Munster, and later King William IV. The aboriginal name Kou-gee was recorded in 1841 by Thomas Watson and has been variously spelt Koojee, Coojee and Coogee. The first European settlement in the region occurred with the ill-fated settlement by Thomas Peel at the Clarence townsite behind Woodman Point in 1829. The townsite being abandoned in 1831. Settlement of the area commenced in the 1870s around Lake Coogee on Rockingham Road (the first road between Fremantle and Rockingham). The current residential area of Coogee commenced development in the 1980s. Previously it was an area of limestone ridge, small rural lots and market gardens in the west and south portions of the current suburb. Denser residential development was limited to a small area in the northwest of the current suburb about Beach Road and King Street. That area was better known as the locality of Coogee Beach. Some buildings still standing in that area date back to the nineteenth century.  Coogee Hotel  In 1898, Walter Powell applied for a publican's licence in Four-mile Well, Coogee. He extended and renovated the existing building, turning it into the Coogee Hotel. He traded for twenty years, until his death in 1923, fostering local sports, particularly horse racing, and giving the local community of meat workers and market gardeners a place to socialise and relax. The hotel was de-licensed in 1927, and became a holiday home for orphans under the Swan Anglican Children's Homes in 1930. In 1946 the orphans were housed there full-time. In 1968, threatened with demolition by Main Roads to build a high-capacity road through the area, the orphanage sold the hotel and moved out. It was not demolished, and was used intermittently as private offices. An extension was added in the early 1990s, and the building was heritage listed in 2001. Geography Coogee is located 7 km south of Fremantle and overlooks Cockburn Sound with views of Garden Island, Carnac Island and Rottnest Island. The suburb is bounded by Ocean Road to the north, Hamilton Road to the east, the Beeliar Drive (road extension) to the south and Cockburn Road/Indian Ocean to the west. To the southwest of the suburb lies Woodman Point, an \\"A\\" Grade reserve with several kilometres of beach frontage onto Cockburn Sound. Features of Woodman Point include a large jetty used during World War II for the transport of munitions. There are also a large number of disused but preserved munitions stores in the reserves. The Reserve also features large picnic areas and is a popular fishing locality. A project known as Port Coogee is under construction to the North-West of Coogee in the suburb now known as North Coogee. It includes a new marina and a housing estate to complement the existing suburb of Coogee. While geographically the suburb of Coogee is a relatively small and defined residential area, the name Coogee has been used extensively as a regional name and reference point. The Southern part of the neighbouring suburb of Munster was previously known as the two localities of South Coogee (or Coogee South) and Woodman Point. Lake Coogee is now within that portion of Munster. In December 2005 a portion of Coogee was incorporated into the new suburb of North Coogee. Facilities There is a single government primary school, Coogee Primary School, located in the southern portion of the suburb.

Its local government area is the City of Cockburn. History The earliest known settler at Hamilton Hill was Sydney Smith, the agent of Captain George Robb. Robb arrived in Western Australia in 1830 and took up land south of Fremantle. During the next twelve months Smith was actively engaged in establishing Robb's farm. In a letter dated 27 August 1830, he gives his address as Hamilton Hill. The origin of the name, and whether it was Robb or Smith who did the naming, remains uncertain but the area has been known as such ever since. In 1860 Charles Alexander Manning bought of Robb's land, and six years later built Davilak House for his son Lucius Manning. The house of twelve rooms, was built using convict labour and was owned by the Manning family until they abandoned it in the late 1950s. It burnt down in 1960, and after this the Shire of Cockburn took over the administration of the whole estate. A second homestead was built in 1920 by the eldest daughter of Lucius Manning, Azelia Ley. She had married John Morgan Ley in 1900, and after he died in 1927 she continued to maintain the family farm. This house became derelict after Azelia died in 1954, but was restored by the Historical Society of Cockburn in 1983 and now serves as a comprehensive Azelia Ley Homestead Museum of artefacts pertaining to the Cockburn district. At the turn of the century South Fremantle and the northern parts of Cockburn like Hamilton Hill became the location of semi rural industries such as market gardening and horse racing stables.http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/8dd9ae39-dc82-46d9-96a3-7c458d275b04 Geography Hamilton Hill is bounded by Cockburn Road to the west, Phoenix Road to the south, Stock Road to the east and Jean Street and Winterfold Road to the north.

He was the Secretariat of Intelligence (SIDE) of the Argentine Republic from December 1999 to October 2000, during the first half of Fernando de la R√∫a's presidency. De Santiba√±es resigned the position after the media discovered the Secretariat's involvement in the Senate Bribery scandal. He was absolved of all charges related to the scandal in 2013. Biography Born in Berisso, a working class suburb of La Plata, de Santiba√±es studied Economics at the Universidad del Salvador and the University of Chicago. He was a banker at the Banco Financiero from 1984 and headed the company from 1993 until it was sold to BBVA Banco Franc√©s in 1997 for $184 million. His tenure at Financiero was highlighted by the acquisition of the much larger Banco de Cr√©dito Argentino. =Tenure at State Intelligence= De Santiba√±es was appointed Secretary of Intelligence by his close friend and neighbor, the newly inaugurated President Fernando de la R√∫a. Discontent at the agency intensified when de Santiba√±es had 1,200 SIDE personnel fired, drastically reducing the agency's operational capabilities. The most serious controversy, however, arose when de Santiba√±es was implicated in the Argentine Senate bribery scandal of 2000, in which SIDE provided $5 million in cash that was later used to bribe six senators and the Parliamentary Secretary, Mario Pontaquarto, to support a government-sponsored labor law flexibilization bill in April of that year. De Santiba√±es reacted by staging a series of television interviews in which he criticized the governing political coalition, the Alliance, declaring it should dissolve because its internal crisis was hampering economic growth. His resignation had been demanded by members of FrePaSo, the government's junior coalition partner; Vice President Carlos √Ålvarez, FrePaSo's most prominent figure, resigned in October over de la R√∫a's reluctance to dismiss the SIDE Secretary. De Santiba√±es ultimately resigned as SIDE chief on October 23, 2000. Following his resignation, de Santiba√±es dedicated himself to breeding horses at his estate in Pilar, Buenos Aires. He, as well as Dick Morris' and Roger Stone's IKON Public Affairs, were sued in 2004 by Mattie Lolavar, a U.S. born public relations agent, for breach of contract. Her political consulting firm, Triumph Communications, was hired by IKON in July 2000 to represent the SIDE as media consultants in both Argentina and the United States; the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled against Lolavar in 2005. Following a number of stays, de Santiba√±es, former President de la R√∫a, and other officials faced criminal charges related to the Senate Bribery scandal in 2007; they were ultimately absolved of all charges on December 23, 2013.

They're comparable to similar movements internationally, such as American minicomics and Japanese doujinshi. A \\"small press comic\\" is essentially a zine composed predominantly of comic strips. The term emerged in the early 1980s to distinguish them from zines about comics. Notable artists who have had their start in British small press comics include Eddie Campbell, Paul Grist, Rian Hughes, Jamie Hewlett, Alan Martin, Philip Bond and Andi Watson. Small press comics are traditionally sold by mail, using reviews and classified adverts, websites, email lists and word of mouth to reach an audience. There is usually one or more mail order service, commonly known as a \\"distro\\", operating in the UK. These will hold a wide range of titles and take a cut of the cover price. The two main active distros are SamuSamu and SmallZone.SmallZone They are also sold at conventions and festivals, with small groups of like-minded creators often sharing a table at a reduced rate. Specialist small press events include Caption in Oxford, and the UK Web and Mini Comix Thing in London. Creators will often make international links to these forms of distribution in other countries and vice versa. Distribution into comic book stores via traditional distributors (such as Diamond) is rare. Stores will often stock titles by local creators though some, notably Gosh!Gosh! in London and Page 45Page 45 in Nottingham, stock a wider range. In recent times small press titles have sold in larger bookstores Borders and Foyles in London. The traditional format has been a photocopied and stapled booklet, usually at A5 size, similar to American minicomics, although other sizes are known. While some creators continue to produce publications in this style, emphasising the hand-made aspect and often decorating each copy by hand, in recent years the increasing availability of digital printing has made professional printing affordable for short-run publications. Some of the spirit of small press comics can now also be found in webcomics. History =Background= Traditionally, a small press publisher was simply a publisher who operated on a small scale, often with a manual printing press in-house, producing limited print-runs of publications that larger, more commercially inclined publishers would reject. The history of British small press comics is tied up with the underground press of the 1960s with publications such as Oz and International Times, the British underground comix scene led by Nasty Tales and Knockabout Comics of the 1970s and with the Punk zine explosions of the late 1970s. The latter was probably more significant as it was born of cheap and accessible photocopying. This dramatic lowering of technological barriers to entry meant anyone could produce a publication with a print run as low as one regardless of commercial potential. Within the British comics fandom of the 1970s and early 1980s there were many zines about comics, mainly concentrating on American superhero titles. Since high-street retailers of comics were scarce these zines ran mail order services and relied on the postal service for distribution. The first and most famous of these was Fantasy Advertiser. There were also regular markets or \\"marts\\" which also served as a social meeting place for aficionados. This gave a backbone for small press comics to emerge and in many cases react against. =The 1970s= Among the earliest British small press comics was The Tale of Beem Gotelump, the story of an aging jazz musician who is tasked by the Archangel Gabriel with playing the last trump at the end of the world, created and published by Eddie Campbell under the pseudonym \\"Roland Bunn\\" in 1975.Darren Schroeder, \\"Eddie Campbell: The Oracle\\" , Comics Bulletin, 20 March 2001, retrieved 2 March 2009 Kevin O'Neill, then working in newsstand humour comics, mostly on the production end, created (with co-writer Jack Adrian) and published Mek Memoirs, a 12-page \\"stripzine\\" about a robot war in 1976, which can be seen as a precursor on his work on 2000 AD.Lew Stringer, \\"Kevin O'Neill: The Early Days\\", 17 February 2009, retrieved 2 March 2009 Perhaps the most successful of all British small press comics is the adult humour comic Viz, first published in Newcastle in 1979. It grew out of the punk fanzine scene, and went on to successful newsstand publication, continuing to the present day. =The 1980s= The first flowering of British small press comics centred on Fast Fiction, which began as a stall run by Paul Gravett at the bi-monthly Westminster Comic Mart in London in 1981, and developed into an anthology, a mail order service and a news sheet. In its various forms it lasted until 1990. Artists associated with this scene included Eddie Campbell, Phil Elliott, Glenn Dakin, Paul Grist, Ed Hillyer, Woodrow Phoenix, Rian Hughes, Bob Lynch, Ed Pinsent, and the teenage Warren Ellis. \\"Who KNows What Evil Lurks...\\", retrieved 2 March 2009 Campbell argues it was he who persuaded his fellow artists to call their publications \\"small press comics\\" rather than \\"fanzines\\", after seeing the term \\"small press\\" used for similar publications at a poetry festival.Eddie Campbell, blog post, 27 October 2008 Gravett and Peter Stanbury published many of the Fast Fiction artists in Escape Magazine from 1983 to 1989. Between 1983 and 1995 Zine Zone (later Zine Zone International), a Bristol-based company specialising in mail order, comic mart service and publications, focused international attention on UK Small Pressers and helped a number go on to mainstream comics, including D'Israeli and Duncan Fegredo.Phil Latter, \\"Terry Hooper: Keeper of the Black Tower\\" , 2005 1987 three students from Northbrook College, Worthing, Jamie Hewlett, Philip Bond and Alan Martin, produced two issues of a small press comic called Atomtan. This came to the attention of Brett Ewins who invited them to contribute to his new comics magazine, Deadline, which began in 1988. Hewlett and Martin created the magazine's flagship character, Tank Girl, and Hewlett has gone on to work in animation, most notably creating the cartoon rock group Gorillaz. =The 1990s= After Ed Pinsent wound up the last incarnation of Fast Fiction, cartoonist Luke Walsh (later known as Luke Temple Walsh) and reader Mike Kidson took over their mailing list for their review zine Zum!, the first issue appearing in August 1991. Zum! distributed copies of comics submitted to a panel of reviewers, often cartoonists themselves, who were encouraged to write critical reviews of significant length. It also featured reproductions of the comics under review. Zum! continues as a website run by Paul Schroeder.Zum! Caption, a zine-cum-APA devoted to small press comics edited by Jenni Scott, ran from 1992 to 1998, and spawned the still- active Caption small press comics convention, held annually in Oxford. The 1990s saw the reemergence of fanzines about comics in the Fantasy Advertiser mould. Battleground, edited by Andy Brewer, was at first mainly concerned with American superhero comics, although it also featured reviews and articles on small press comics and interviews with the cartoonists. Vicious, edited by Pete Ashton, was more free-form, promising to print all material submitted. Ashton also created TRS (\\"The Review Sheet\\"), collecting capsule reviews and contact details for small press comics, in 1995. In 1996 he set up the BugPowder distribution service, which sold any British small press comics that cared to be listed as well as importing selected books from the US and Europe. TRS was discontinued in 1998, before being revived as TRS2 by Andrew Luke. BugPowder closed as a distributor in 2000, but the BugPowder blog continues to spotlight British small press activity, and includes the now-online TRS2.BugPowder blog Slab-O-Concrete was a mail order distro and publisher set up by Australian pavement artist Peter Pavement and also Dave Hanna in the early 1990s. Its first title was Pavement's own Pavement Pizza, and it soon began selling British small press comics (including such titles as Time Warp: The End of the Century Club, by Ed Hillyer; Sugar Buzz by Woodrow Phoenix and Witch by Lorna Miller) and zines on marts in Brighton and Hove, and importing books from the US, Australia and Europe. Slab-O-Concrete developed into a full-scale publisher, repackaging small press comics for the bookshop market and originating new work. It avoided the direct market of comic shops and made connections with underground publishers, zinesters, indie record labels and other subcultural scenes. Slab was laid low by cashflow issues in 2001. Other groups included Dachshund, run by Andy, aka Andy Konky Kru, which published Graphic Reviews, a review zine featuring reviews in comic strip form by Lee Kennedy and others, and an A8 sized anthology, Itsy Bitsy. Andrew Moreton set up Massive, a small press distro, in 1992, and also published a zine, The Comics Cut Quarterly. Psychopia, was a zine and distro set up by cartoonist B. Patson in 1994, which still exists online.Psychopia Other cartoonists sold their work through classified ads in Comics International magazine. Notable self-published comics of the 90s included Paul Grist‚Äôs Kane, Gary Spencer Millidge‚Äôs Strangehaven, Sleaze Castle by Dave McKinnon and Terry Wiley and Strange Weather Lately by Metaphrog all of which received wide-spread distribution through Diamond Comic Distributors. =The 2000s= From 2000 until 2011 Metaphrog went on to produce the full-colour Louis series of graphic novels which received mainstream media attention and book shop distribution. Recent creators to have launched through the small press include Gary Northfield, whose Derek the Sheep has gained a recurring slot in the Beano. Writer Jason Cobley, who has been self-publishing his Bulldog comics since the mid-90s, and former Bulldog Empire artist Neill Cameron, now work for The DFC and Classical Comics. Garen Ewing, who worked in small press comics in the 1990s, moved onto the web with The Rainbow Orchid, soon to be published in print by Egmont UK, and also contributes to The DFC. The Etherington Brothers (Robin and Lorenzo), creators of the small press comic Malcolm Magic, have gone on to create \\"Monkey Nuts\\" for The DFC, \\"Yore\\" for the Dandy and \\"Baggage\\" for Random House. PJ Holden, Al Ewing, Arthur Wyatt and David Baillie (comics) emerged from the small press to work for 2000 AD. One of the current leading distros is SmallZone,SmallZone founded in 1999 by Shane Chebsey, which also provides a printing service for small press creators. Chebsey and Andrew Richmond also publish comics under the Scar Comics banner.Scar Comics In 2006 the first Scar Comics graphic novel, Falling Sky by Ben Dickson, won \\"Best Indie Surprise\\" on Ain't It Cool News. Another activist for British independent comics is writer/artist Barry Renshaw. Founding the Engine ComicsEngine Comics imprint in 2000, Renshaw wrote and published the Rough Guide to Self Publishing, which is now in its fourth edition (2007) and was described as 'essential purchase for budding self- publishers' by industry paper Comics International. In 2004, Engine Comics launched Redeye Magazine, a news/reviews magazine specifically created to educate and promote small press and self-published comics to the wider public. It has been described as a 'vital read' by SFX magazine and \\"a must have\\" by Ain't It Cool News. Other titles include Seven Sentinels and the Fusion anthology. Accent UK,Accent UK a collective headed by Dave West (Deva Comics) and Colin Mathieson (M56 Comics), was formed in 2002 and produced themed US format anthologies featuring contributions from dozens of UK independent creators. In addition to the founding members, regular contributors to Accent UK publications include Andy Bloor, Jon H. Ayre, David Hitchcock, John Reppion and Leah Moore (daughter of Alan Moore), Bridgeen Gillespie (Mr Maximo & Rabbit), Garry Brown, and David Baillie. The 2007 anthology Zombies, included a cover by American artist Steve Bissette. The Judge Dredd Megazine featured a regular small press spotlight section between the years of 2007 and 2009, featuring columns by Matt Badham and David Baillie and a selection of strips by creators from the small press scene. FutureQuake Publishing was originally set up to publish the anthology comic FutureQuake. By a combination of launching new titles and taking over existing ones whose owners retire from the scene, they have built up a stable including MangaQuake, Something Wicked and Lost Property, as well as 2000AD fanzines Zarjaz and Dogbreath. Solar Wind has won numerous awards for its long-running series of parodic comics, which pastiche the style of children's comics of the 1970s. The group publishes Solar Wind, Sunny for Girls, Big War Comic, Omnivistascope and is connected to The End Is Nigh (through Solar Wind editor/writer Paul Scott and other creators). London Underground ComicsLondon Underground Comics is both a weekly market stall in Camden Lock Market and a loose collective of U.K. based small press creators whose work is sold and displayed on the weekly stall. London Underground Comics was founded in November 2007 by Camden-based creator Oli Smith who co-ran the stall with the help of a variety of small press creators until 2009. LUC also ran larger one-day events that took up an additional of Camden Lock Market such as No Barcodes in April 2008 and Low Energy Day in August 2008. LUC promoted their stall and events via YouTube videos. The UK Web and Mini Comix ThingUK Web and Mini Comix Thing was a yearly event in London run by Patrick Findlay that brings the British small press and webcomics communities together to sell and promote their work. Radio 4 broadcast a series on small press publishing, aired late 2009. One of the episodes focussed on small press comics, reviewing titles from both The UK and from the USA/Canada. One of the titles featured was the cult London small press comic \\"Eat, Drink & Be Buried.\\" Recent years have seen the rise of the small press both on line and in print with conventions around the UK on an almost weekly basis and vibrant review platforms like Broken Frontier and Slings and Arrows supporting creators‚Äô work.

He is largely responsible for the increasing popularity of frame drums in the United States and around the world. Velez is married to Loire. Biography Of Mexican American ancestry, Velez was born in Dallas and grew up in Texas but moved to New York City in 1967. He began by playing jazz on the drums but soon gravitated to hand drums from around the world (frame drums in particular), seeking out teachers from many different musical traditions. Among the many instruments Velez favors are the Irish bodhr√°n, the Brazilian pandeiro, the Arabic riq, the North African bendir, and the Azerbaijani ghaval. Although these instruments are similar in construction, they have their own playing techniques. Velez has studied each instrument traditionally, but he has also developed his own cross-cultural musical vocabulary, mixing and adapting techniques from various cultures and developing new ones (such as playing the bodhr√°n with brushes). He has been influential in the growing international interest in frame drums, and many younger players now use his techniques. He teaches percussion and frame drums at Mannes College of Music and The Juilliard School. He also plays other percussion instruments such as the Venezuelan maracas and steel drum, and is skilled at overtone singing and Konnakol. Velez's compositions are frequently composed for cross-cultural ensembles in which he himself also performs; he is particularly fond of polyrhythm‚Äîsuperimposing different meters simultaneously. Velez was a longtime member of the Paul Winter Consort and Steve Reich and Musicians. He has also worked with Layne Redmond, Howard Levy, Steve Gorn, Rabih Abou-Khalil, Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, Marc Cohn, Suzanne Vega, Glen Moore, Malcolm Dalglish, and Jonas Hellborg . Velez's students include Layne Redmond, Yousif Sheronick, Shane Shanahan, Glen Fittin, Randy Crafton, and N. Scott Robinson, and Taku Hirano.

He died in the early hours of January 1, 2012, from a gunshot wound, at his farm, after the New Year celebrations. Soria was the governor of Rio Negro Province at the time. His widow was charged with first-degree murder on January 19, 2012. Life and times =Early life and career= Soria was born in Bah√≠a Blanca in 1949, and was raised in a nearby rural town, General Daniel Cerri. His father, Ernesto Soria, was an outspoken Peronist, and was arrested shortly after the 1955 coup against President Juan Per√≥n. Following his release several months later, the Sorias relocated to Bariloche. The elder Soria was again arrested amid a crackdown on Peronist protests during a state visit to Bariloche by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in March 1959, and was imprisoned in Bah√≠a Blanca. He was released in April 1962 and the family settled in General Roca, R√≠o Negro, where they opened a neighborhood store. Carlos Soria enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires, earning a Law degree in 1973. Elections that March returned Peronists to power, and Soria was elected to the local Justicialist Party (JP) chapter. He was later elected to the Provincial Council of the JP, and upon the return of democracy in 1983, won a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. =Tenure in Congress= Soria would be elected to Congress for four consecutive terms, becoming Chairman of the Constitutional Affairs Committee. He also served in the Justice, Impeachments, and Money Laundering committees; chaired the joint committee investigating the 1992 Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires and the 1994 AMIA bombing (the two most significant acts of Islamic terrorism in Argentine history); and served in the Council of Magistracy of the Nation. Soria shared President Carlos Menem's opposition to trials opened in 1996 in Spanish courts against Dirty War perpetrators by Judge Baltasar Garz√≥n, and personally led a delegation to protest these trials; when Judge Garz√≥n turned the tables on the delegation by calling them to testify, they returned, however, creating an embarrassing diplomatic incident. He later presented a bill to restrict rights and toughen sentences for those accused of violent crime, as well as another which would have granted congressional immunity to all members in perpetuity; both bills were defeated. Soria would later be indicted for obstruction of justice in his capacity as Chair of the Joint Committee on the AMIA bombing, and though he was cleared of all charges, the R√≠o Negro PJ dropped him from their party list ahead of the 1999 elections. Soria was then offered a place in the Buenos Aires Province PJ list for Congress by Governor Eduardo Duhalde. Shortly before the October 1999 elections, moreover, Duhalde appointed Soria as Provincial Minister of Justice. His appointment took place on the heels of the September 16 Ramallo massacre, a botched Provincial Police intervention during an armed bank robbery that resulted in the deaths of two hostages. Soria promptly released hitherto sequestered police files relating to the case which confirmed that the robbery, as well as the deaths of all robbers and hostages alike, had been orchestrated by Provincial Police officers. Remaining on the electoral list for National Deputies, Soria took his seat in Congress in December representing the Province of Buenos Aires. He became among the leading congressional opponents of President Fernando de la R√∫a's austerity package, scuttling a 2000 decree which would have cut public sector salaries (this ultimately took place the following year). President de la R√∫a's resignation in December 2001, and the subsequent Congressional designation of Duhalde as provisional president resulted in Soria's appointment as Secretary of State Intelligence (SIDE) in January 2002. =Tenure at State Intelligence= Taking office, as President Duhalde did, amid widespread protest, Soria's tenure at SIDE would eventually be marred by a June 26 incident in which two piqueteros, Maximiliano Kosteki and Dar√≠o Santill√°n, were shot in the back in Avellaneda by Provincial Police officers. SIDE had produced intelligence reports stating that the overthrow of the national government had been openly advocated in piqueteros' assemblies, and that these were attended by the extremist group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Phone conversations between minutes before the assassinations between a policeman implicated in the incident and the Undersecretary of Intelligence at the time, Oscar Rodr√≠guez, proved SIDE involvement in the tragedy in subsequent trials. Fallout from this incident was compounded by allegations made by Senator Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner that SIDE personnel were spying on her husband, Santa Cruz Governor N√©stor Kirchner, who had recently declared his intention to run for President the following year. These controversies, and Soria's own plans to run for Governor of the Province of R√≠o Negro, prompted his resignation from SIDE in July. He was narrowly defeated in provincial elections in August 2003 by UCR candidate Miguel Saiz, though in elections held later in 2003, Soria narrowly won the election for mayor of the city of General Roca (the largest in the province). Duhalde and Soria continued to face charges in court related to the 2002 deaths. Soria declared at trial in 2005 that \\"democracy works with order, and we needed to establish order\\"; both men were cleared of all charges. =Return to R√≠o Negro= Soria was overwhelmingly reelected as mayor of General Roca in 2007, garnering 73% of the vote. He clinched the Justicialist Party nomination for Governor of R√≠o Negro in 2011, and ran with the support of the Front for Victory (FpV) faction of the party despite his long-standing alliance with the FpV's main rival, Duhalde. Soria's principal opponent in the race, UCR nominee C√©sar Barbeito, also professed his support of the FpV's standard-bearer, President Cristina Kirchner. The president formally endorsed Soria despite their past differences, however, while maintaining her distance from both candidates. Soria was elected governor in September with 51% of the vote, besting Barbeito by nearly 14%. =Death= Soria died on January 1, 2012, during the new year celebrations with his family at his farm near General Roca. He was shot in the face with a .38 caliber weapon at around 5 am, and was moved immediately to a nearby hospital, where he died minutes later. The police didn't determine initially whether the death was caused by an accident or foul play; his wife was held for further questioning. He received a private funeral. His widow was charged with first-degree murder on January 19, 2012.La viuda de Soria, imputada de homicidio doblemente agravado T√©lam, 19 January 2012 Vice- governor Alberto Weretilneck succeeded Soria as governor. Weretilneck considered calling new elections, despite provisions in the Constitution of R√≠o Negro Province that would allow him to complete the remainder of Soria's term.

He was born in Enfield, New Hampshire in 1820. His emigrant ancestor was Allan Perley. During the 1840s, he established a lumber business based on timber from northern New York. As high quality wood became harder to find, Perley and his partner, Gordon B. Pattee, decided to relocate to the Ottawa Valley and established sawmills near Ottawa supplying wood to the United States. Perley and Pattee's Sawmill, at Chaudi√®re Falls near Ottawa With other timber interests, in 1866, he helped establish the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company, a system of horse-drawn trams, which provided transportation for people but also moved lumber from the sawmills to ships and trains. Perley, with J.R. Booth and others, helped develop railways in the region, including the Canada Atlantic Railway and the Ottawa, Arnprior & Parry Sound Railway. He failed in an attempt to become the Liberal-Conservative Party candidate for Ottawa City in 1882, but was later elected as a Conservative in the same riding in 1887. Although his business had originally benefited from reciprocal trade agreements between Canada and the United States, later in life, he supported protective tariffs to help develop the economy of Canada. Perley died in Ottawa in 1890 while still in office.

Chester Hill shares the postcode of 2162 with the neighbouring suburb of Sefton.  History  An early market garden and orchard area north- west of Bankstown, it developed into a residential and light industrial area after the Regents Park railway line came through in 1924. The construction site of the station was known as Boroya, an aboriginal word of unknown meaning, but when the station open on 8 October 1924, it carried the name Chester Hill. A local resident, Miss H. A. McMillan first suggested that the new railway station should be called Hillcrest (after an estate near Regent's Park), but many objections were raised and the name was discarded. Miss McMillan then suggested Hillchester, after a quaint town in England, but this also was not well received by the community (it was later learnt that McMillian created the story of an English town to gain support for the name, as no such locality with the name Hillchester exists). Suggesting yet another name, McMillian recommended Chester Hill which was received far better than her previous suggestions. The area that became Chester Hill was originally the southern part of John Thomas Campbell's Campbell Hill estate, which covered in 1815 between Parramatta, Liverpool and Woodville Roads. Much of this land remained undeveloped until the first subdivision was made in the 1920s when the first shops were also built. The post office opened in July 1934, and the first public school in January 1945.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 60 A significant tract of land between Priam and Hector Streets had been occupied by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) from the 1960s.

It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History The suburb of Chullora was originally part of the area known as Liberty Plains, which was land given to the first free settlers who arrived in Sydney Cove on 6 January 1793. In the 1950s, many immigrants from Europe were housed in the area. Once established, they moved to other parts of Sydney. Chullora was the name used for one of the estates in this area. Chullora is an Aboriginal word meaning 'flour'. The construction of the Tip Top Bakeries, has perhaps brought the suburbs back to its roots. During World War II, Chullora was selected as the site for a major wartime manufacturing plant. The site once occupied several hundred acres of land surrounded by Rookwood Cemetery, Brunker Road, the Hume Highway and Centenary Drive. The site was said to have been the largest secret manufacturing plant in Australia which was used for the production of military weapons, plane components, tanks, HE Bombs and ordnance. Over two thousand men and women were employed to work at the factory on a daily basis. During the war the factory produced components for 700 Beaufort, 380 Beaufighter and up to 50 Lincoln aircraft. Over 54 ACI tanks were built as well as 60 General Lee tanks that were adapted for use in the Australian Military, as were local jeeps in the 1970s. The factory also produced 81 cupola turrets for the British Matilda tanks. Chullora \\"Bunker\\" and tunnels near Sydney, NSW. Were they used during WW2? An underground \\"bunker\\" and tunnel system is located on this site. It is directly under a block flats in Davidson Street and Marlene Crescent. The entrance to the \\"bunker\\" is by steel doors set in concrete into the hillside in a railway cutting which runs from alongside the railway line parallel to Marlene Crescent at a platform called the Railwelders and which leads under the block of flats. The doors to this \\"bunker\\" were welded up in the late 1980s. The steel doors are no longer visible, and the associated area has been back filled. Apart from the bunker, there is also a network of storage facilities that extend under the railway workshop. Sometime between 1977 and 1978 the steel access doors were fitted with locks (Railway SL type). The airshafts for this \\"bunker\\" are still clearly seen from the Hume Highway and some of them are within metres of the roadway. It has also been alleged that a tunnel approximately 6 km (4 miles) long connects this complex with Bankstown Bunker, (RAAF headquarters during World War II) on the corner of Marion and Edgar Street Condell Park. Access to this network of storage facilities was from a steel door, bolted into the side of a stormwater drain which runs along the old Roads & Traffic Authority building in Chullora, it then runs under the Hume Hwy and eventually under the rail workshop. Commercial area Chullora is essentially an industrial area with many factories and warehouses, including Tip Top Bakeries and the OfficeMax Sydney warehouse at the Chullora Business Park. Chullora also houses the printing plants for Sydney newspapers and magazines. Fairfax Media print The Sydney Morning Herald and The Sun-Herald and News Corp Australia prints The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph.

East Hills is a residential suburb on the northern bank of the Georges River. The adjacent suburbs are Panania and Picnic Point. Nearby suburbs on the opposite bank of the Georges River include Pleasure Point, Voyager Point, Sandy Point and Hammondville. History East Hills was the name used to describe the whole area south of Bankstown to the Georges River and east to The River Road. George Johnstone (1790‚Äì1820) was granted here in 1804 and called it New Jerusalem. It was west of The River Road between Bransgrove and Tomson Streets. Robert Gardiner a tenant on the property called his farm East Hills, possibly after the region of that name near Liverpool, England and since this area is close to another Liverpool. In 1828 Thomas Graham was granted , south of Johnston‚Äôs land, which he sold to Charles Tompson in 1835. The area to the west was bought by George Nicholas Weston in 1838.

It is an important instrument in both folk and classical music throughout the Arabic-speaking world. It traditionally has a wooden frame (although in the modern era it may also be made of metal), jingles, and a thin, translucent head made of fish or goat skin (or, more recently, a synthetic material). It is between 20 and 25 cm in diameter. Descended from the daf, like the tar, the riq acquired its name in the 19th century so that it could be differentiated. The riq is played in takht ensembles (Egypt, Syria) or chalghi ensembles (Iraq) where it has a particularly clearcut role, going beyond the simple rhythmic requirements of the daf, tar, or mazhar. In Sudan, where it seems to have been introduced recently, the riq is also related to worship, as in upper Egypt. The frame of the riq can be covered on both the inner and outer sides with inlay such as mother-of-pearl, ivory or decorative wood, like apricot or lemon. It has ten pairs of small cymbals (about 6 cm in diameter), mounted in five pairs of slits. The skin of a fish or young goat is glued on and tightened over the frame, which is about 6 cm deep. In Egypt the riq is usually 20 cm wide; in Iraq it is slightly larger. Traditionally, frame drums have been used to support the voices of singers, who manipulate them themselves; but the player of the riq, like that of the doira of Uzbekistan, plays without singing. While the daff and the mazhar are held relatively still, at chest or face height, with the player seated, the riq, because of the use of different tone-colours, may be violently shaken above the head, then roughly lowered to the knee, and played vertically as well as horizontally. The player alternates between striking the membrane and shaking the jingles, and his need for freedom of movement necessitates that he stand up. Students of the instrument are required to master the technical problems imposed by the timbre of the membrane and the jingles, both separately and in combination; aside from developing a virtuoso technique they also need to learn the many rhythmic cycles and the techniques of modifying them through creative invention.  Riq evolution  The riq has experienced many changes over the last 2 decades. The riq traditionally has a wooden frame with animal skin glued, however, due to exposure to moisture the skin would loosen the skin to a point which made the unplayable. Riq makers attempted to solve the issue of the animal skin by using a nylon skin pulled over a wooden frame with a thing metal and 5 large metal bolts, which was the first evolution of the riq. Ultimately, this solved the issue with the skin tuning, however introduced a weight problem which made the riq difficult to play due to being much heavier. After many experimental processes master riq maker Kevork (based in Lebanon) introduced a new technique riq making and the second evolution of the riq (which only recently has been imitated). The new technique involved tuneable and replaceable skins while hiding the tuning screws inside the wood frame which ultimately eliminated the weight problem of the previous version of the riq. Kevork's invention thereby influenced many other riq makers to imitate his creation, the most prominent makers of which are; Nakhle, Ghassan, Emin and Yal√ßinkaya. Many Arabic percussionists and music experts consider Kevork the greatest riq maker of all as his riq's have not been surpassed in the quality of sound and the aesthetics of the instrument itself. Many consider riq maker Nakhle the closest imitation to Kevork.

In 2010, Allen was elected a Trustee of the Royal Geographical Society. He has recorded six TV series for the BBC, either alone or with partial or total use of camera crews, and pioneered the use of the head-held camera for TV, for the first time allowing viewers to witness immersion of a traveller in remote environments without the artifice brought about by a camera-crew. He has published ten books, including the Faber Book of Exploration, which he edited. On 15 November 2017, Allen was reported missing while undertaking an expedition in Papua New Guinea. However, he resurfaced on 16 November 2017, near an airstrip. Early life and education When Allen was a child, he went on fossil-hunting expeditions in Lyme Regis, Dorset, on England's Jurassic Coast. His father, Colin Allen, a test pilot who taught Prince Philip how to fly, brought back exotic presents and so passed on to his son the sense that there was still an exciting world out there waiting to be explored. Amongst explorers, his heroes are Laurens van der Post and naturalist Peter Matthiessen. To him, \\"the greatest explorers are people like this who just listen and learn, and don't impose.\\" Allen has two older sisters, Katie and Susie. He was educated at Bradfield College, and read Environmental Science at the University of East Anglia. He joined three scientific expeditions during his last year at university. Higher education  Allen began a degree in Ecology at the University of Aberdeen but did not take the final exam, claiming to have been distracted by planning his first independent expedition from the mouth of the Orinoco to that of the Amazon. Reality television In 2009, Allen was one of four stars of the reality epic Expedition Africa, airing on History. The eight-part series followed the team as they retraced the journey of Henry Morton Stanley in his quest to find David Livingstone, the journey which supposedly ended with the famous phrase, \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?\\" Patronage  Allen is a Patron of the Environmental Justice Foundation and Save the Rhino Trust. Expeditions After publishing five books describing his various lone journeys across the least explored regions of the Amazon, New Guinea and Sumatra, in the mid 1990s Allen went on to develop the technique of self-filming with a camcorder, becoming the first (and for many years the only) television adventurer - through such programmes as The Skeleton Coast, which depicted a first full traverse by foot of the Namib Desert. While still a student, Allen took part in scientific expeditions to a volcano in Costa Rica, to a remote forest in Brunei, and - as leader - to a glacier in Iceland. He went on to establish his reputation through a series of daring independent journeys to cross through the least known regions of the Amazon and New Guinea. He made first outside contact with two threatened indigenous peoples ‚Äì the Obini and Yaifo. Today Allen is acknowledged as one of the last great adventurers in the classic mould, the Daily Telegraph listing him as one of the top ten British explorers of all time\\"Britain's Greatest Explorers Benedict Allen\\", 25/01/2013, Daily Telegraph with the only other living individual being Sir Ranulph Fiennes. He went on to develop the technique of self-filming while on his immersive expeditions; he was described as ‚ÄúPart of the History of Television‚Äù by former Director General of the BBC Mark Thompson. Allen crossed the northeast Amazon basin in 1983, going 600 miles on foot and by dugout canoe, facing an attempt on his life by renegade gold miners, starvation, and malaria along the way (a trip he described in his 1985 book, Mad White Giant). This incident is featured on the I Shouldn't Be Alive episode \\"Alone in the Amazon\\" and was aired in 2010. In West Papua and Papua New Guinea he flew from the Obini community in Irian Jaya. He participated in the six-week male initiation ceremony of the Niowra tribe\\"An Interview With Legendary Explorer Benedict Allen\\", 02/09/2015, Huffington Post (Into the Crocodile's Nest). In Siberut and Sumatra he investigated the \\"Orang pendek\\" ape man, via the Mentawai of Siberut and the Kubu of Sumatra (\\"Hunting the Gugu\\"). Allen crossed the central mountain range of New Guinea and the Torres Strait to Australia. He made 'first contact' with the Yaifo people in New Guinea (The Proving Grounds). Allen crossed the Amazon basin at its widest point, 1,200 miles from the Andes of Ecuador, through the lowland jungle to Mato Grosso in Brazil, helped by the Matses Indians (Through Jaguar Eyes). In the Cocha Brava he went in search of tigers (The Raiders of the Lost Lake). In the Namib Desert (1995), he spent three and a half months travelling with three reluctant camels, learning from the nomadic Himba tribe to survive with little food or water (The Skeleton Coast). Allen crossed the steppe and Gobi desert in five and a half months, going 3,000 miles by horse and camel through Siberian drylands and Mongolian steppe (The Edge of Blue Heaven). In the Mato Grosso he investigated the Kalapalo Indians‚Äô story of the disappearance of Colonel Fawcett (The Bones of Colonel Fawcett). He attempted to cross the Bering Straits. He travelled with dogs 2500 miles through Chukchi and Inuit peoples and beyond (Ice Dogs). He visited spiritual healers including Voodoo witchdoctors in Haiti, the Mentawai in Indonesia, the Huichol of Mexico and shamans in Siberia (Last of the Medicine Men). =On television= Allen joined Frank Gardner in the BBC Two two-part documentary Birds of Paradise: The Ultimate Quest.

Theological opinions and doctrines known as Nouvelle Th√©ologie or neo-modernism and their consequences on the Church were its primary subject. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange (1877‚Äì1964), professor of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas Angelicum, is said to have been a dominant influence on the content of the encyclical.\\"No one has ever found a 'smoking gun' proving that Garrigou-Lagrange shared in ghost-writing Humani generis or has ever fixed his exact contribution. But, as noted above, it is plain that he had a major role in its gestation.\\" \\"Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange: Defending the Faith from Pascendi dominici gregis to Humani generis\\", Michael Kerlin, US Catholic Historian, Vol. 25, No. 1, Winter, 2007, 111.. Humani generis is the papal encyclical that deals most directly with the topic of evolution.  Encyclical  = Role of theology = \\"This deposit of faith our Divine Redeemer has given for authentic interpretation not to each of the faithful, not even to theologians, but only to the teaching authority of the Church.\\"Pius XII, Encyclical Humani generis: some false opinions threatening to undermine the foundation of Catholic doctrine\\", Vatican City, 1950, 21. In Humani generis, Pope Pius held a corporate view of theology. Theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in all kinds of empirical research, which the Church will generously support, but in matters of morality and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the Magisterium. > The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the > Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ‚Ä¶ in that sense in which > it has been defined by the Church.Pius XII, Enc. Humani generis, 21. Humani generis is critical of some trends in modern theology, but does not mention or attack individual opinions or even groups of dissenting theologians, possibly because of the much larger, still looming power issue of who teaches authoritatively the Catholic faith: bishops, as successor to the Apostles; or theologians, who have constant access to relevant information and research tools. The Pope later refers to a new axiom, \\"a new intellectual current, a new public mood within the Church, and, new behaviour patterns\\" of its members. He asked his fellow bishops, to heal this \\"intellectual infection\\", which should not be allowed to grow.Pius XII, The Magisterium of the Bishops, May 31, 1954. = Obstacles to finding God = The Church teaches that God can be known with certainty from the created world with human reason.Catechism of the Catholic Church, Vatican City, 36. Yet in the historical conditions in which he finds himself, man experiences many difficulties in coming to know God by the light of reason alone: This is why Humani generis begins with a recognition of several obstacles to seek and find God by the light of reason alone: > Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural > power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one > personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and > of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many > obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this > inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and > man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are > translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender > and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of > such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but > also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So > it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what > they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful.Pius XII, Enc. > Humani generis, 2. This is why man stands in need of being truthfully enlightened by God's revelation. = Four issues = Having thus established a main principle, the encyclical continues with a review of the philosophical currents of modern culture and their potential and dangers in light of divine revelation of faith in the distinct levels. It reviews recent theological, philosophical and scientific developments.  Nouvelle th√©ologie  In describing erroneous development in the Catholic Church after World War II, the encyclical does not mention names, nor does it accuse specific persons or organization. in France and its followers in other countries increasingly viewed Catholic teaching as relative. It departed from traditional neo-Thomism using relativistic historical analysis and engaging philosophical axioms, such as existentialism, or positivism. scholars expressed Catholic dogma with concepts of modern philosophy, immanentism or idealism or existentialism or any other system. Some believed that the mysteries of faith cannot be expressed by truly adequate concepts but only by approximate and ever-changeable notions.Pius XII, Enc. Humani generis, 15. Pius has some sympathy for the need to deepen and more precisely articulate Church doctrine: > Everyone is aware that the terminology employed in the schools and even that > used by the Teaching Authority of the Church itself is capable of being > perfected and polished; and we know also that the Church itself has not > always used the same terms in the same way. It is also manifest that the > Church cannot be bound to every system of philosophy that has existed for a > short space of time. Nevertheless, the things that have been composed > through common effort by Catholic teachers over the course of the centuries > to bring about some understanding of dogma are certainly not based on any > such weak foundation. These things are based on principles and notions > deduced from a true knowledge of created things. In the process of deducing, > this knowledge, like a star, gave enlightenment to the human mind through > the Church. Hence it is not astonishing that some of these notions have not > only been used by the Ecumenical Councils, but even sanctioned by them, so > that it is wrong to depart from them. Pius pleads with the \\"rebels\\" not to tear down but to build up. He demands not to neglect, or to reject, or devalue so many and such great resources which have been conceived, expressed and perfected over the centuries. A new philosophy like existentialism, \\"today, like a flower of the field in existence, tomorrow outdated and old-fashioned, shaken by the winds of time\\", he says, is a poor and unstable basis for the theology of the Church. There was speculation that Dutch Jesuit Sebastiaan Tromp, professor of theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, had assisted in drafting the encyclical.  Evolution  The encyclical took up a nuanced position with regard to evolution. It distinguished between the soul, held as created divinely, and the physical body, whose development may be subject to empirical and prudent study: > The Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity > with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and > discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with > regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the > origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter ‚Äì for > the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by > God.\\"Humani Generis (1950)\\", Faith and Science, The Vatican Observatory > Foundation The encyclical does not endorse a comprehensive acceptance of evolution, nor its outright rejection, because it deemed the evidence at the time not convincing. It allows for the possibility in the future: > This certainly would be praiseworthy in the case of clearly proved facts; > but caution must be used when there is rather question of hypotheses, having > some sort of scientific foundation, in which the doctrine contained in > Sacred Scripture or in Tradition is involved.Pius XII, Enc. Humani generis, > 35. The position delinking the creation of body and soul has been more recently confirmed by Pope John Paul II, who highlighted additional facts supporting the theory of evolution half a century later.  Polygenism  While the factual basis for creationism should be researched further, the encyclical issues a clear no to another scientific opinion popular at the time, polygenism, the scientific hypothesis that mankind descended from different groups of original humans (that there were many groups of Adams and Eves). > When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely > polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. For > the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after > Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin > through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all, or that > Adam represents a certain number of first parents. Now it is no way apparent > how such an opinion can be reconciled with that which the sources of > revealed truth and the documents of the Teaching Authority of the Church > propose with regard to original sin, which proceeds from a sin actually > committed by an individual Adam and which through generation is passed on to > all and is in everyone as his own.Pius XII, Enc. Humani generis, 37.  Old Testament critiques  A final critique is issued against negative interpretations which downgrade the Old Testament to historical half-truths. Some Catholic theologians > place these scriptures on a par with myths or other such things, which are > more the product of an extravagant imagination than of that striving for > truth. The Book of Genesis both states the principal truths which are > fundamental for our salvation, and also gives a popular description of the > origin of the human race and the chosen people.Pius XII, Enc. Humani > generis, 38. Humani generis encourages further research, taking into account and respecting the holiness of the Old Testament scriptures to Jews and Christians alike. = Conclusion = Pope Pius XII, who usually employs diplomatic and carefully measured language in his writings, is convinced of the serious nature of those opinions threatening to (to quote the encyclical's subtitle) \\"undermine the foundation of Catholic doctrine\\", a most unusual tone for this pontiff. Philosophy and theology are the main topics of this encyclical. But it extends further into the realm of culture and science. The encyclical is a document with firm distinctions between right and wrong, good and bad. Pius XII is convinced about the indivisibility and timeless nature of truth. The encyclical is flexible in all areas of scientific research which do not intrude into or exclude theology. It demands respect for the intellectual achievements of past generations, which were equally intelligent, but is not afraid to face a future with new questions and improvements. Humani generis generated much discussion at its time. It reflects many conservative positions of the Pope, but also his openness to science and new developments. It reflects his belief: \\"It is the primary duty of a Christian, to convince those who consider themselves modern, that human nature should not be interpreted with systematic pessimism nor with shallow optimism.\\" One effect of Humani generis was \\"a freezing of systematic theology into a Thomist orthodoxy\\", later ameliorated by Pope John Paul II's 1993 Veritatis splendor. > Let them strive with every force and effort to further the progress of the > sciences which they teach; but let them also be careful not to transgress > the limits which We have established for the protection of the truth of > Catholic faith and doctrine.

In the case of an ongoing insult (a neurodegenerative insult) the relative preservation of neuronal integrity implies a reduction in the rate of neuronal loss over time, which can be expressed as a differential equation. It is a widely explored treatment option for many central nervous system (CNS) disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and acute management of neurotoxin consumption (i.e. methamphetamine overdoses). Neuroprotection aims to prevent or slow disease progression and secondary injuries by halting or at least slowing the loss of neurons. Despite differences in symptoms or injuries associated with CNS disorders, many of the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration are the same. Common mechanisms include increased levels in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, inflammatory changes, iron accumulation, and protein aggregation. Of these mechanisms, neuroprotective treatments often target oxidative stress and excitotoxicity‚Äîboth of which are highly associated with CNS disorders. Not only can oxidative stress and excitotoxicity trigger neuron cell death but when combined they have synergistic effects that cause even more degradation than on their own. Thus limiting excitotoxicity and oxidative stress is a very important aspect of neuroprotection. Common neuroprotective treatments are glutamate antagonists and antioxidants, which aim to limit excitotoxicity and oxidative stress respectively.  Excitotoxicity  Glutamate excitotoxicity is one of the most important mechanisms known to trigger cell death in CNS disorders. Over- excitation of glutamate receptors, specifically NMDA receptors, allows for an increase in calcium ion (Ca2+) influx due to the lack of specificity in the ion channel opened upon glutamate binding. As Ca2+ accumulates in the neuron, the buffering levels of mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration are exceeded, which has major consequences for the neuron. Because Ca2+ is a secondary messenger and regulates a large number of downstream processes, accumulation of Ca2+ causes improper regulation of these processes, eventually leading to cell death. Ca2+ is also thought to trigger neuroinflammation, a key component in all CNS disorders = Glutamate antagonists = Glutamate antagonists are the primary treatment used to prevent or help control excitotoxicity in CNS disorders. The goal of these antagonists is to inhibit the binding of glutamate to NMDA receptors such that accumulation of Ca2+ and therefore excitotoxicity can be avoided. Use of glutamate antagonists presents a huge obstacle in that the treatment must overcome selectivity such that binding is only inhibited when excitotoxicity is present. A number of glutamate antagonists have been explored as options in CNS disorders, but many are found to lack efficacy or have intolerable side effects. Glutamate antagonists are a hot topic of research. Below are some of the treatments that have promising results for the future: *Estrogen: 17Œ≤-Estradiol helps regulate excitotoxicity by inhibiting NMDA receptors as well as other glutamate receptors. *Ginsenoside Rd: Results from the study show ginsenoside rd attenuates glutamate excitotoxicity. Importantly, clinical trials for the drug in patients with ischemic stroke show it to be effective as well as noninvasive *Progesterone: Administration of progesterone is well known to aid in the prevention of secondary injuries in patients with traumatic brain injury and stroke *Simvastatin: Administration in models of Parkinson's disease have been shown to have pronounced neuroprotective effects including anti-inflammatory effects due to NMDA receptor modulation *Memantine: As a low-affinity NMDA antagonist that is uncompetitive, memantine inhibits NMDA induced excitotoxicity while still preserving a degree of NMDA signalling.  Oxidative stress  Increased levels of oxidative stress can be caused in part by neuroinflammation, which is a highly recognized part of cerebral ischemia as well as many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The increased levels of oxidative stress are widely targeted in neuroprotective treatments because of their role in causing neuron apoptosis. Oxidative stress can directly cause neuron cell death or it can trigger a cascade of events that leads to protein misfolding, proteasomal malfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, or glial cell activation. If one of these events is triggered, further neurodegradation is caused as each of these events causes neuron cell apoptosis. By decreasing oxidative stress through neuroprotective treatments, further neurodegradation can be inhibited. = Antioxidants = Antioxidants are the primary treatment used to control oxidative stress levels. Antioxidants work to eliminate reactive oxygen species, which are the prime cause of neurodegradation. The effectiveness of antioxidants in preventing further neurodegradation is not only disease dependent but can also depend on gender, ethnicity, and age. Listed below are common antioxidants shown to be effective in reducing oxidative stress in at least one neurodegenerative disease: * Acetylcysteine: It targets a diverse array of factors germane to the pathophysiology of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders including glutamatergic transmission, the antioxidant glutathione, neurotrophins, apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory pathways. * Crocin: Derived from saffron, crocin has been shown to be a potent neuronal antioxidant. *Estrogen: 17Œ±-estradiol and 17Œ≤-estradiol have been shown to be effective as antioxidants. The potential for these drugs is enormous. 17Œ±-estradiol is the nonestrogenic stereoisomer of 17Œ≤-estradiol. The effectiveness of 17Œ±-estradiol is important because it shows that the mechanism is dependent on the presence of the specific hydroxyl group, but independent of the activation of estrogen receptors. This means more antioxidants can be developed with bulky side chains so that they don't bind to the receptor but still possess the antioxidant properties. *Fish oil: This contains n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that are known to offset oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. It has high potential for being neuroprotective and many studies are being done looking at the effects in neurodegenerative diseases *Minocycline: Minocycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline compound that is capable of crossing the blood brain barrier. It is known to be a strong antioxidant and has broad anti-inflammatory properties. Minocyline has been shown to have neuroprotective activity in the CNS for Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and ALS. *PQQ: Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as an antioxidant has multiple modes of neuroprotection. *Resveratrol: Resveratrol prevents oxidative stress by attenuating hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular accumulation of ROS. It has been shown to exert protective effects in multiple neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and ALS as well as in cerebral ischemia. *Vinpocetine: Vinpocetine exerts neuroprotective effects in ischaemia of the brain through actions on cation channels, glutamate receptors and other pathways. The drop in dopamine produced by vinpocetine may contribute to its protective action from oxidative damage, particularly in dopamine-rich structures. Vinpocetine as a unique anti-inflammatory agent may be beneficial for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases. It increases cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. *THC: Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol exerts neuroprotective and antioxidative effects by inhibiting NMDA neurotoxicity in neuronal cultures exposed to toxic levels of the neurotransmitter, glutamate. *Vitamin E: Vitamin E has had varying responses as an antioxidant depending on the neurodegenerative disease that it is being treated. It is most effective in Alzheimer's disease and has been shown to have questionable neuroprotection effects when treating ALS. A meta-analysis involving 135,967 participants showed there is a significant relationship between vitamin E dosage and all-cause mortality, with dosages equal to or greater than 400 IU per day showing an increase in all-cause mortality. However, there is a decrease in all-cause mortality at lower doses, optimum being 150 IU per day. Vitamin E is ineffective for neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease.  Stimulants  NMDA receptor stimulants can lead to glutamate and calcium excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Some other stimulants, in appropriate doses, can however be neuroprotective. *Selegiline: It has been shown to slow early progression of Parkinson's disease and delayed the emergence of disability by an average of nine months. * Nicotine: It has been shown to delay the onset of Parkinson's disease in studies involving monkeys and humans. * Caffeine: It is protective against Parkinson's disease. Caffeine induces neuronal glutathione synthesis by promoting cysteine uptake, leading to neuroprotection.  Other neuroprotective treatments More neuroprotective treatment options exist that target different mechanisms of neurodegradation. Continued research is being done in an effort to find any method effective in preventing the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases or secondary injuries. These include: *Caspase inhibitors: These are primarily used and studied for their anti apoptotic effects. *Trophic factors: The use of trophic factors for neuroprotection in CNS disorders is being explored, specifically in ALS. Potentially neuroprotective trophic factors include CNTF, IGF-1, VEGF, and BDNF *Therapeutic hypothermia: This is being explored as a neuroprotection treatment option for patients with traumatic brain injury and is suspected to help reduce intracranial pressure. * Erythropoietin has been reported to protect nerve cells from hypoxia-induced glutamate toxicity (see erythropoietin in neuroprotection). * Lithium exerts neuroprotective effects and stimulates neurogenesis via multiple signaling pathways; it inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), upregulates neurotrophins and growth factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)), modulates inflammatory molecules, upregulates neuroprotective factors (e.g., B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70)), and concomitantly downregulates pro-apoptotic factors. Lithium has been shown to reduce neuronal death, microglial activation, cyclooxygenase-2 induction, amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤), and hyperphosphorylated tau levels, to preserve blood-brain barrier integrity, to mitigate neurological deficits and psychiatric disturbance, and to improve learning and memory outcome. * Neuroprotectin D1 and other neuroprotectins (see specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived protectins/neuroprotectins) and certain resolvins of the D series (i.e. RvD1, RvD2, RvD3, RvD4, RvD5, and RvD6; see specialized proresolving mediators#DHA- derived Resolvins) are docosanoid metabolites of the omega 3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) while resolvins of the E series (RvD1, RvD2, and RvD3; see specialized proresolving mediators#EPA-derived resolvins (i.e. RvE)) are eicosanoid metabolites of the omega 3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These metabolites, which are made by the action of cellular lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, and/or cytochrome P450 enzymes on DHA or EPA, have been shown to have potent anti-inflammation activity and to be neuroprotective in various models of inflammation-involving neurological diseases such as various degenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. A metabolically resistant analog of RvE1 is in development for the treatment of retinal disease and neuroprotectin D1 mimetics are in development for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and hearing loss.

Its highest point is Jabal Yaman (24 meters high), situated about three kilometers from Ra's al Yaman, the southeastern cape of the island.  History  The harbour Kamaran had been inhabited for centuries when the Portuguese established an outpost there in the 16th century. During the second part of the 19th century, the island was occupied by the Turks who built a quarantine station for pilgrims from East Africa, the Persian Gulf, India and the East conducting the hajj by sea to the Ottoman-controlled Muslim holy city of Mecca. During the early months of World War I, there was a debate among the British on the suitability of occupying Kamaran and the other Turkish-held Red Sea islands such as the Farasan Islands. Those who opposed the move pointed out that when war broke out, Great Britain had solemnly declared that it had no territorial ambitions in the area; even a temporary occupation might be seen by the Arabs, particularly the Imam of Yemen, as a breach of that promise. Finally, the decision was taken to occupy Kamaran and on the 9th of June 1915, the RMS Empress of Russia landed an armed party on the island, previously evacuated by the Turkish garrison. G. A. Richardson, formerly vice-consul at Hudaydah and Kamaran, also disembarked to act as Political Officer with additional responsibility for Police, Treasury and Customs.John Baldry, \\"British Naval Operations against Turkish Yaman 1914-1919\\", Arabica, T. 25, Fasc. 2 (Jun., 1978), p. 163. While the British continued to administer Kamaran from Aden, they never declared formal possession. In 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne, which divided up the defeated Ottoman Empire, declared an end to its sovereignty over the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent islands, whose future was to be \\"settled by the parties concerned\\" without specifying those parties. Britain continued to administer the island despite the objections of Yemen which claimed sovereignty over the island. In 1949, Britain formally declared the governor of Aden to be the governor of Kamaran but the island did not become a part of the colony.The Kamaran Order in Council, 1949 (SI 1949/137) =Quarantine station= Kamaran's flat, barren landscape NAAFI canteen in 1927 After the departure of the Turks, an international control was exercised over the quarantine station, but it was in fact placed under British administration. In anticipation of a vast increase in the number of the faithful from British India, the Dutch East Indies, etc. who would make the pilgrimage the camp was greatly extended. Long lines of barrack-like sleeping quarters were constructed where the Turks had provided only wattle huts. Big disinfecting plants were installed where the pilgrims went through an ordeal of cleansing on a production line basis. A power station was built. The local water supply being inadequate, a massive distillation plant was introduced to make sea water fit for drinking. There were carpenters‚Äô shops, machine shops, a small railway to transport fuel and stores, a wireless station, a fine landing stage, a cantonment of officials‚Äô bungalows. This proved a bonanza for the islanders. They prospered on this trade in potential disease among the devout, and the population grew. In the village of Kamaran, the only settlement apart from a few isolated groups of fishermen‚Äôs huts, fine houses and a magnificent mosque went up, and a lively trade in pilgrim requirements was conducted with the mainland.Nigel Groom, \\"The Island of Two Moons: Kamaran 1954\\", British- Yemeni Society Journal, 2002. Norman Lewis describes that, during Thompson's commissionership, resident islanders worked primarily as pearl divers and would rarely last past the age of 50 due to the harsh work-induced stresses. However, this prosperity was short-lived. Determined to control the pilgrimage in all its aspects, the Saudi Arabian Government decided to construct its own quarantine station and to insist that Kamaran be by-passed. Soon, the long lines of buildings in the camps lay empty and deserted; a handful of men maintained was had become a ghost town while arrangements were debated for its breaking up and disposal.

The town is today much appreciated for its beaches and natural setting, which has made tourism the most important activity for its inhabitants. In 2010 the population was 6,500. Amasra has two islands: the bigger one is called B√ºy√ºk ada ('Great Island'), the smaller one Tav≈üan adasƒ± ('Rabbit Island').  History  :For namesakes, see Amastris (disambiguation) Situated in the ancient region of Paphlagonia, the original city seems to have been called Sesamus (Greek: Œ£ŒÆœÉŒ±ŒºŒøœÇ), and it is mentioned by HomerHomer, Iliad, ii. 853 in conjunction with Cytorus. StephanusStephanus, Ethnica, s.v. \\"Amastris\\" says that it was originally called Cromna (); but in another place,Stephanus, Ethnica, s.v. \\"Cromna\\" where he repeats the statement, he adds, as it is said; but some say that Cromna is a small place in the territory of Amastris, which is the true account. The place derived its name Amastris from Amastris, the niece of the last Persian king Darius III, who was the wife of Dionysius, tyrant of Heraclea, and after his death the wife of Lysimachus. Four small Ionian colonies, Sesamus, Cytorus, Cromna, also mentioned in the Iliad,Homer, ii. 855 and Tium, were combined by Amastris, after her separation from Lysimachus,Memnon, History of Heraclea, 5, 9 to form the new community of Amastris, placed on a small river of the same name and occupying a peninsula.Strabo, Geography, xii. 3 According to Strabo, Tium soon detached itself from the community, but the rest kept together, and Sesamus was the acropolis of Amastris. From this it appears that Amastris was really a confederation or union of three places, and that Sesamus was the name of the city on the peninsula. This may explain the fact that MelaPomponius Mela, De chorographia, i. 93 mentions Sesamus and Cromna as cities of Paphlagonia, while omitting Amastris.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, vi. 2 The territory of Amastris produced a great quantity of boxwood, which grew on Mount Cytorus. Its tyrant Eumenes presented the city of Amastris to Ariobarzanes of Pontus in c. 265‚Äì260 BC rather than submit it to domination by Heraclea, and it remained in the Pontic kingdom until its capture by Lucius Lucullus in 70 BC in the second Mithridatic War.Appian, The Foreign Wars, \\"The Mithridatic Wars\\", 82 The younger Pliny, when he was governor of Bithynia and Pontus, describes Amastris, in a letter to Trajan,Pliny the Younger, Letters, x. 99 as a handsome city, with a very long open place (platea), on one side of which extended what was called a river, but in fact was a filthy, pestilent, open drain. Pliny obtained the emperor's permission to cover over this sewer. On a coin of the time of Trajan, Amastris has the title Metropolis. It continued to be a town of some note to the seventh century of our era. From Amasra got its name an important place of Constantinople, the Amastrianum. Arrian writes that the Amastris was a Greek city, which had a port for ships. He also adds that it was 90 stadia from the river Parthenius and 60 stadia from the ErythiniArrian, Periplus of the Euxine Sea, ¬ß 20 The city was not abandoned in the Byzantine Era, when the acropolis was transformed into a fortress and the still surviving church was built. It was sacked by the Rus during the First Russo-Byzantine War in the 830s. Speros Vryonis states that in the 9th century a \\"combination of local industry, trade, and the produce of its soil made Amastris one of the more prosperous towns on the Black Sea.\\"Vryonis, The decline of medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor: and the process of Islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century, (Berkeley: University of California, 1971), p. 14 In the 13th century Amastris exchanged hands several times, first becoming a possession of the Empire of Trebizond in 1204,Anthony Bryer, \\"David Komnenos and Saint Eleutherios\\", Archeion Pontou, 42 (1988-1989), p. 179 then at some point in the next ten years being captured by the Seljuk Turks, until finally in 1261, in her bid to monopolize the Black Sea trade, the town came under the control of the Republic of Genoa. Genoese domination ended when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered the whole Anatolian shores of the Black Sea.Franz Babinger dates the conquest to autumn of 1460, although Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k would date its capture to A.H. 863 (AD 1458/1459).

In the late 8th century its bishop obtained from the Byzantine Emperor its elevation to the rank of autocephalous archeparchy. It is listed as such in the Notitia Episcopatuum attributed to Basil the Armenian (c. 840) and in that of Leo VI the Wise (early 10th century). In the middle of the 10th century it obtained the rank of Metropolitan see without suffragans, a rank it held until, due to the diminution in the number of Christians in the area, it was suppressed. From the 14th century to the second half of the 15th, the town was also the seat of a bishopric of the Latin Church.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 561-566Jean Richard, La Papaut√© et les missions d'Orient au Moyen Age (XIII-XV si√®cles), √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1977, pp. 236 and 246Sim√©on Vailh√©, v.

The walls of the castle were built by the Byzantines. The front walls and gates were built by the Genoese in the 14th and 15th centuries.Local signage Though located on a narrow peninsula, a tunnel under the castle leads to a fresh water pool. =Fatih Mosque= Built as a Byzantine church in the 9th century AD. The church narthex section consists of three parts. After Fatih Sultan Mehmet conquered Amasra in 1460, it was converted to a mosque. It is open to prayers.There is also a chapel at the same street but it is closed to prayers since 1930. Amasra church mosque =Bird's Rock Road Monument= Bird's Rock Road Monument was created between AD 41-54 by order of Bithynia et Pontus Governor Gaius Julius Aquila. It was a resting place and monument. At the time when Claudius was Rome's Emperor, Aguila was the commander of the building army in the eastern provinces. It is located a little outside Amasra on the road in, it is easily accessed by steps leading from the roadside. Bird's Rock Road Monument  Power Station  In 2009, a coal-fired power station of 2640 MWe (or 1200 MWe) was proposed, but after concerns were raised about the effect on air quality, marine ecology, and ash it was not built.

Iatrogenic causes account for approximately 56% of esophageal perforations, usually due to medical instrumentation such as an endoscopy or paraesophageal surgery. In contrast, the term Boerhaave syndrome is reserved for the 10% of esophageal perforations which occur due to vomiting. Spontaneous perforation of the esophagus most commonly results from a full-thickness tear in the esophageal wall due to a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure combined with relatively negative intrathoracic pressure caused by straining or vomiting (effort rupture of the esophagus or Boerhaave's syndrome). Other causes of spontaneous perforation include caustic ingestion, pill esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, infectious ulcers in patients with AIDS, and following dilation of esophageal strictures. In most cases of Boerhaave's syndrome, the tear occurs at the left postero-lateral aspect of the distal esophagus and extends for several centimeters. The condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is fatal without treatment. The occasionally nonspecific nature of the symptoms may contribute to a delay in diagnosis and a poor outcome. Spontaneous effort rupture of the cervical esophagus, leading to localized cervical perforation, may be more common than previously recognized and has a generally benign course. Preexisting esophageal disease is not a prerequisite for esophageal perforation but it contributes to increased mortality. This condition was first documented by the 18th-century physician Herman Boerhaave, after whom it is named. A related condition is Mallory-Weiss syndrome which is only a mucosal tear. In case of iatrogenic perforation common site is cervical esophagus just above the upper sphincter whereas spontaneous rupture as seen in Boerhaave's syndrome perforation commonly occurs in the lower one-third of esophagus.Bailey & Love, 25th ed., page 1014 Signs and symptoms The classic history of esophageal rupture is one of severe retching and vomiting followed by excruciating retrosternal chest and upper abdominal pain. Odynophagia, tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, fever, and shock develop rapidly thereafter. Physical examination is usually not helpful, particularly early in the course. Subcutaneous emphysema (crepitation) is an important diagnostic finding but is not very sensitive, being present in only 9 of 34 patients (27 percent) in one series. A pleural effusion may be detected. Mackler's triad includes chest pain, vomiting, and subcutaneous emphysema, and while it is a classical presentation, it is only present in 14% of people. Pain can occasionally radiate to the left shoulder, causing physicians to confuse an esophageal perforation with a myocardial infarction. It may also be audibly recognized as Hamman's sign. Pathophysiology Esophageal rupture, in Boerhaave syndrome is thought to be the result of a sudden rise in internal esophageal pressure produced during vomiting, as a result of neuromuscular incoordination causing failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle (a sphincter within the pharynx) to relax. As the intra-oesophageal pressure increases, the bolus within the oesophagus has nowhere to go superiorly (as the cricopharyngeus fails to relax) which causes the oesophagus to rupture. The syndrome is commonly associated with the consumption of excessive food and/or alcohol as well as eating disorders such as bulimia. The most common anatomical location of the tear in Boerhaave syndrome is at left posterolateral wall of the lower third of the esophagus, 2‚Äì3 cm before the stomach. Currently, the most common cause of esophageal perforation is iatrogenic. However, iatrogenic perforations, while still constituting a serious medical condition, are easier to treat and less prone to complications, particularly mediastinitis and sepsis. This is because they usually do not involve contamination of the mediastinum with gastric contents. Diagnosis Upright chest radiography showing mediastinal air adjacent to the aorta and tracking cephalad adjacent to the left common carotid artery. This patient presented to the Emergency department with severe chest pain after eating. Sagittal remormatted CT image showing discontinutity in the wall of the posterolateral aspect of the distal esophagus The diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome is suggested on the plain chest radiography and confirmed by chest CT scan. The initial plain chest radiograph is almost always abnormal in patients with Boerhaave's syndrome and usually reveals mediastinal or free peritoneal air as the initial radiologic manifestation. With cervical esophageal perforations, plain films of the neck show air in the soft tissues of the prevertebral space. Hours to days later, pleural effusion(s) with or without pneumothorax, widened mediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema are typically seen. CT scan may show esophageal wall edema and thickening, extraesophageal air, periesophageal fluid with or without gas bubbles, mediastinal widening, and air and fluid in the pleural spaces, retroperitoneum or lesser sac. The diagnosis of esophageal perforation could also be confirmed by water-soluble contrast esophagram (Gastrografin), which reveals the location and extent of extravasation of contrast material. Although barium is superior in demonstrating small perforations, the spillage of barium sulfate into the mediastinal and pleural cavities can cause an inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis and is therefore not used as the primary diagnostic study. If, however, the water-soluble study is negative, a barium study should be performed for better definition. Endoscopy has no role in the diagnosis of spontaneous esophageal perforation. Both the endoscope and insufflation of air can extend the perforation and introduce air into the mediastinum. Patients may also have a pleural effusion high in amylase (from saliva), low pH, and may contain particles of food. =Differential diagnosis= Common misdiagnoses include myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, lung abscess, pericarditis, and spontaneous pneumothorax. If esophageal perforation is suspected, even in the absence of physical findings, chest xray, water soluble contrast radiographic studies of the esophagus and a CT scan should be promptly obtained. In most cases, non-operative management is administered based on radiological evidence contained in mediastinal collection. Treatment With the exception of a few case reports describing survival without surgery, the mortality of untreated Boerhaave syndrome is nearly 100%. Its treatment includes immediate antibiotic therapy to prevent mediastinitis and sepsis, surgical repair of the perforation, and if there is significant fluid loss it should be replaced with IV fluid therapy since oral rehydration is not possible. Even with early surgical intervention (within 24 hours) the risk of death is 25%.

It is located in the heart of the city center, next to the Parliament of Norway Building (Stortinget). The station is served by all six lines of the metro. At the street level, the station serves tram routes 11, 17, and 18 on the Ullev√•l Hageby Line as Tinghuset and Prof. Aschehougs gate. Stortinget is 'kilometer marker zero' for the metro network and is owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon. There has been a tram stop at Tinghuset since the opening of the Oslo Tramway, in 1875. The rapid transit station opened as Sentrum in 1977, and was connected to the eastern network of the metro. It was forced to close in 1983 due to leaks. It took the new name following the 1987 re-opening; this time it was also connected to the western network. The station has four platforms; originally two were used for the eastern trains and two for the western ones. Since 1993, trains have passed through the station. History The first underground railway to serve Oslo was the extension of the Holmenkoll Line to Nationaltheatret in 1928. The company, Holmenkolbanen, had plans for further extensions into the heart of the city, but high costs during the construction of the initial tunnel hampered progress. In 1954, the Parliament of Norway decided to build a rapid transit system for Oslo. Four lines to the east of the city would be built, and in 1966 the section from T√∏yen to Jernbanetorget opened by Oslo Sporveier. Jernbanetorget was located adjacent to Oslo East Station, the main railway station serving Oslo. However, the eastern lines also did not extend into the core of the central business district of the capital. Ticket inspection at Stortinget During the 1960s, the Oslo Tunnel was being planned to connect the Drammen Line to Oslo East Station. This would make the West Station unnecessary, and would allow a central station to be built at the location of the East Station. The tunnel was planned to run in a similar route as would be necessary to connect Jernbanetorget to Nationaltheatret, and a railway station was planned to connect to Nationaltheatret. Simultaneously, Oslo Sporveier worked with possibilities to connect their eastern and western networks, and get both into the city core. During the 1960s, the planning office for the metro proposed to build a connecting tunnel between Nationaltheatret and Jernbanetorget. However, the initial plans involved creating a station close to Nationaltheatret, named for Slottsparken, which would serve as the transfer point between the two systems. This station had a planned dimension to hold 25,000 people. At the time, the western and eastern networks were incompatible; in addition to different platform heights, the eastern network used six-car trains with a third-rail power supply, while the western network used overhead wires and two-car trains. The initial plans were met with criticism, following media's discovery that the main planners had not consulted several hired specialists, and that alternatives to the preferred route had not been made. As a consequence, several engineers working for the Norwegian State Railways made two alternative suggestion for the route. By 1975, the plans were changed so Nationaltheatret would become the transfer station, by building a balloon loop for the eastern trains, while the western trains would terminate as before. This solution would allow the two networks to be connected later. In 1978, the city planner discarded the proposal from Oslo Sporveier to build a new station at Slottsparken, and instead decided that Stortinget would become the interchange between the two systems. This would allow the western network to later be upgraded to metro standard and allow through trains. The proposal was supported by all political parties except the Labour Party. The decision to build Sentrum Station was taken by the city council on 22 May 1969; the decision also involved that the transfer station be placed at Slottsparken/Nationaltheatret. Construction started in 1972, and the first leaks were revealed. By the time the station opened on 9 January 1977, the leaks had not been removed. During trials in January, it turned out that the tracks were too low for all types of trains to be able to open their doors, causing the tracks to have to be raised. By 1978, the contractor and the municipality felt that the leaks were under control, and the municipality took over the station. In February 1983, the station was closed to finally remove all leaks. At the time, it was expected that the station could reopen in 1984. The leakages were caused by two sources: the use of the wrong type of concrete, and the wrong construction method. These were specified correctly in the tender contracts, but after the contractor was chosen, an agreement was made between the municipality and Selmer for the use of the membrane method. Combined with the inferior quality of concrete, the leaks were unavoidable. In 1986, the municipality sued Selmer for the it cost to repair the station. The station reopened on 7 March 1987, with the new name Stortinget. The name derives from the Parliament of Norway () that is adjacent to the station. The Common Tunnel was completed, and the trains from the western network terminated where at the old platforms, where the eastern trains had previously terminated. The eastern trains instead operated through a balloon loop. The station featured a step-free walk between the two systems. With the opening of Stortinget, the metro network was declared finished, after the last extension on the Furuset Line to Ellingsrud√•sen had been made in 1981. After the opening of Stortinget, only seven new station have opened: Mortensrud (1998), Forskningsparken (1999), Nydalen, Storo (both 2003), Sinsen, Husebybakken (both 2006) and L√∏ren (2016). In 1993, the Sognsvann Line and the Common Tunnel were rebuilt to metro standard, and the first through trains started operating on both sides of Stortinget. By 1995, also the R√∏a Line was upgrades, and all lines started operating through Stortinget. Facilities The hall leading to the platform Stortinget has four platforms. Most regular trains which travel through the city center use the main platforms which were formerly used only for trains on the western side of the network. At each side is a platform for trains from the east terminating at Stortinget. Before the lines were joined together these platforms were used by all trains on the eastern part of the network, but they are now used mainly for extra trains on line 3 running Stortinget-Mortensrud. A loop which passes underneath the main track connects the two side platforms, allowing the trains to turn without having to reverse direction. Service Stortinget is served by all six lines of the Oslo Metro. The station is considered the heart of the system, and is 'kilometer marker zero' for measuring all distances. All services have a 15-minute headway, except during late night. The metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter. The trams running through Grensen and Pilestredet serve the tram stop Tinghuset (the courthouse) next to one of the Metro entrances. The stop is served by lines 11, 17 and 18 of the Oslo Tramway. Westwards, line 17 and 18 operate along the Ullev√•l Hageby Line to Rikshospitalet; travel time is 16 minutes. Line 11 branches off onto the Homansbyen Line to Majorstuen. Eastwards, line 11 operates via Torshov to Kjels√•s. Line 17 operates via Sinsen to Grefsen, with a travel time of 17 minutes. Line 18 operates to Ljabru, with a travel time of 22 minutes. The tramway is operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter.

Recorded in 1981 and released on the cassette-only label ROIR on February 5, 1982, many fans refer to it as \\"The Yellow Tape\\" because of its yellow packaging, much in the way that The Beatles' self-titled record is often called \\"The White Album\\". Though Bad Brains had recorded the 16 song Black Dots album in 1979 and the 5-song Omega Sessions EP in 1980, the ROIR cassette was the band's first release of anything longer than a single.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. \\"Bad Brains: Artist Biography by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\\". AllMusic. Retrieved February 2, 2017. Background and recording After being banned from all the major clubs in their hometown of Washington, DC, Bad Brains moved to New York City in 1981.Logan, Ben; Stein, Mandy (2012). Bad Brains: A Band in DC (documentary). Plain Jane Productions. In addition to their regular gigs at CBGB's, the band frequented Jerry Williams' 171-A Studios in Alphabet City. Named for its location between 10th and 11th Streets on Avenue A, 171-A was a 60-foot room with a stage at one end and an elevated sound-proof booth at the other. When the Bad Brains played a gig at 171-A in May 1981, Williams recorded it on reel-to-reel tape. The band liked the sound and returned to 171-A to record between August and October 1981. 12 of the 15 tracks on the album came from these sessions, while \\"Jah Calling\\", \\"Pay to Cum\\" and \\"I Luv I Jah\\", were from Williams' live recording in May.Blush, Steven (2001). American Hardcore: A Tribal History. Second ed., 2010. Feral House. .  Release  Bad Brains was originally released on February 5, 1982 in cassette-only format on Reachout International Records (ROIR). The cover art depicts DC's Capitol Building being struck by a bolt of lightning. The original cover art unfolded to include a photo of the band, album credits, lyrics to all the songs, and liner notes by then New York Rocker and Soho News critic Ira Kaplan, who would later front the band Yo La Tengo. Rather than label the tape's sides A/B or one/two, the band designated them Side 1/Side A. The original edition of the cassette had a white spine on the J-card and a red or yellow cassette shell. Subsequent editions had an all- yellow J-card with either red, gold, or green cassette shells, in a nod toward band's Rastafarian leanings. Later versions appeared in solid white, solid orange, solid yellow and transparent red tape shells. Because the yellow cassette shell was most common and it came in a matching yellow package, many fans referred to it as \\"The Yellow Tape\\". =Bad Brains EP= In 1981 the Dead Kennedys' record label Alternative Tentacles opened an office in the United Kingdom to issue special editions of records by American punk bands for the UK market. The single version of the Bad Brains' \\"Pay to Cum\\" had appeared on the Alternative Tentacles compilation Let Them Eat Jellybeans! and with the ROIR sessions available, a few songs were selected for a 1982 UK release as a 12\\" EP. The record's sleeve featured the same lightning-strikes-the-Capitol art that appeared on the ROIR cassette, and the back cover had the inner J-card's band photo, credits, lyrics, and Kaplan's liner notes. The record also mimicked the tape's Side 1/Side A aesthetic, differing in that one side was reggae and the other hardcore punk, unlike the cassette, which interspersed the two genres. Because Alternative Tentacles UK was a short-lived venture, the Bad Brains EP is rare, and for eight years was the only appearance of these songs on vinyl. =Track listing= Side A # Sailin' On #Don't Need It #Attitude #The Regulator #Banned In D.C. #Jah Calling #Supertouch/Shitfit #Leaving Babylon Side B #Fearless Vampire Killers #I #Big Takeover #Pay To Cum #Right Brigade #I Luv I Jah #Intro  Reception and influence  When the album was first released, fans and critics alike were stunned to learn that the musicians behind this album ‚Äì one of the fastest albums of all time upon its release ‚Äì were African-American Rastafarians who also were skilled at reggae. Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1982, Robert Christgau said, \\"Turn a fusion band into hardcore propheteers and you end up with fast heavy metal. The best kind for damn sure, especially since they turn their rage into Positive Mental Attitude. I like it fine. But great punks give up more than a salubrious blur.\\" The album was a crucial step in the evolution of hardcore punk and the eventual fusion of hard rock and reggae adopted later by bands like Sublime, Fishbone, and 311. Adam Yauch of Beastie Boys was quoted as saying that this album is \\"the best punk/hardcore album of all time\\". To this day, many people involved in the hardcore scene regard it as one of the greatest hardcore albums of all time and a groundbreaking release for the hardcore punk genre.  Reissues  In 1989, In-Effect Records released a CD version, with the same track listing, titled Attitude: The ROIR Sessions. In 1990, Dutch East India Trading, through its imprint Homestead Records, was the first label to release the album on vinyl in the United States. In 1996, ROIR reissued the original album on CD, featuring a hidden bonus track, followed by an on LP version the following year.  Re-recordings  Many of the album's tracks were re-recorded for their 1983 follow-up, Rock for Light, with the exception of \\"Don't Need It\\", \\"The Regulator\\", \\"Jah Calling\\", \\"Leaving Babylon\\", \\"Pay to Cum\\", \\"I Luv I Jah\\". The instrumental final track on Bad Brains, titled \\"Intro\\", became the first nine seconds of Rock for Light's title song.

It originally appeared in the 1995 anthology Dark Love (edited by Nancy A. Collins, Edward E. Kramer and Martin H. Greenberg). In 1997, it was published in the limited-edition collection Six Stories. In 2002, it was included in King's collection Everything's Eventual, with a scene from the story featured on the cover of the collection's first edition dust jacket. Plot summary  Steven Davis comes home one day to find a letter from his wife, Diane, coldly stating she has left him and intends to get a divorce. He finds himself baffled as to what led her to do this, and over time becomes increasingly depressed. Diane's departure prompts him to give up cigarettes, and he begins to suffer nicotine withdrawal. Diane's lawyer, William Humboldt, calls Steve with plans to meet with the two of them for lunch. He decides on the Gotham Caf√©, and sets a date. Steve's lawyer is unable to attend due to a family crisis. Despite his lawyer's warnings, however, Steve is determined to keep the date and see Diane again. While waiting he impulsively buys an umbrella, despite the weather being clear and sunny. Upon entering, he finds the ma√Ætre d', eventually revealed to be named Guy, apparently in the beginnings of a psychotic break, talking senselessly about a non-existent dog. Convening with Diane and Humboldt at a table near the kitchen, Steve pleads with his estranged wife for an explanation. Much to Steve's consternation, she refuses to go into details and regards him with a mixture of apprehension and contempt. They immediately fall into petty squabbling as Humboldt attempts to get the meeting back on track. Suddenly, Guy the ma√Ætre d' makes a surprise reappearance, homicidally insane, screaming \\"Eeeee!\\", ranting in word salad, and brandishing a chef's knife. Going berserk, Guy brutally kills Humboldt. Steve briefly fends off the lunatic with his umbrella, then drags the helplessly terrified Diane into the kitchen. Guy gives chase and leaves the caf√©'s cook with a grisly injury. Desperately struggling to hold off the lunatic, Steve implores Diane to unbolt the rear entrance door so they can both escape, but she remains in a state of gaping shock. Steve is able to incapacitate Guy by dousing him with scalding water, and hitting him with a metal frying pan. After finally escaping both the Caf√© and Guy, Steve attempts to make sure Diane is all right. Diane recoils from his touch, and rants at him venomously. Devoid of any shred of gratitude for his protection, the events of the last few minutes have only reinforced her perception of Steve as a bullying control freak, and she's decided it is time to stand up to him. When Steve tries to point out that he just saved her life, Diane flatly denies that he did. Incredulous and overwhelmed with fury, he loses interest in reconciliation; Diane's self-empowering harangue is sharply interrupted by Steve slapping her across the face. After attempting to wound him with spurious claims of extramarital lovers, Diane leaves him for good. As Steve sits on the curb watching an ambulance haul away both victims and the heavily- restrained Guy, he is left wondering about Guy's private life, and the nature of insanity. He imagines Guy living in a similar situation to his own, driven insane by the irrationality of his wife, whom he may have murdered before coming to work this day, and the constant barking of the neighbor's dog. Under his breath, he starts to say, \\"Eeeee,\\" perhaps wondering what appeal going insane might hold... Adaptation The story was adapted into a short film entitled \\"Gotham Cafe\\" in 2005, directed by Jack Edward Sawyers. It starred Chaney Kley as Steve, Julie Sands as Diane, Cullen Douglas as Guy, Kevin Brief as Humboldt, Endre Hules, Mick Garris, Robert Axelrod, and Stephen King in a cameo appearance as the voice of Mr. Ring, Steve's lawyer. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak co-produced the film and also made a cameo appearance as an irate diner.

History Slapshot was formed in 1985 by Steve Risteen and Mark McKay, formerly of Terminally Ill; Jack \\"Choke\\" Kelly, formerly of Negative FX and Last Rights and Jonathan Anastas, formerly of Decadence and DYS. Due to the reputations of its members, the band had a relatively high profile even before its debut; the zine writer Mike Gitter (who was also an A&R; executive) wrote \\"Slapshot is a great live act\\", before they had ever played in public. Diverging from their counterparts in the Boston hardcore scene, Slapshot decided to make the first album a 24 track recording as opposed to the usual 8 or 16-track hardcore album. To reduce costs, they recorded at night and completed the album in four sessions. Back On The Map was released by Taang! Records in 1986. The band's lineup underwent a number of changes in its first few years, although its sound remained consistent. Jordan Wood, formerly of S.T.P. and later of Deathwish, joined as an additional guitarist, but took over bass guitar when Anastas left the band to continue his education. This line up was featured on their sophomore release, Step On It (Taang! Records). In July 1988, Jamie Sciarappa, former bass player of SS Decontrol, joined the band and Jordan returned to his original slot as a second guitar player. This 5 piece line up recorded the 3rd record, Sudden Death Overtime (Taang! Records). As the band got ready to record the next record there was a significant line-up change. Jordan left the band returning Slapshot to a single guitar band and Jamie was replaced with Mark & Steve‚Äôs longtime friend Chris Lauria. Soon after, the band decided to fire Steve Risteen due to what they felt was a lack of guitar skill. It was a very difficult time for the band that is well documented in the Slapshot documentary \\"Chip On My Shoulder: The Cautionary Tale of Slapshot\\". Mark McKay eventually also quit (and disconnected himself from the group personally as well) due to multiple issues including a lack of interest in the new material the band was writing. Their 1993 album Blast Furnace (We Bite Records) was a move into sample-based industrial/metal/hardcore and only included one original member, Choke, along with a more metal-based backing band including Darryl Sheppard of Slaughter Shack, Barry Hite & Chris Lauria. Slapshot toured Europe that spring, and on the second date of the tour, they recorded a live album in Berlin called Live At SO36 (We Bite Records). The following year there was another line-up change that resulted in Darryl leaving the band to be replaced by Mike Bowser. They recorded the Unconsciousness LP (We Bite Records) in Chicago with Steve Albini, ex-member of Big Black and producer for Nirvana. In August 1994 Slapshot went off to Europe for a two-month tour with Ignite and a split 7\\" single record was released to promote it. The tour kicked off at the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden on August 11 and ended on October 4 in Germany. Slapshot played 50 shows in 7 countries in 54 days. Around the time Unconsciousness was being recorded tragedy fell upon the band. Ex-guitar and bass player Jordan Wood committed suicide. It was this moment that brought Mark McKay back into the group socially and ultimately back into the band. With its most solid line-up in years Slapshot returned to the studio to record their heaviest album to date, \\"16 Valve Hate\\" (Lost & Found Records/Taang! Records) released in 1995. Less than a year later ‚Äì with the same line-up ‚Äì the band released \\"Olde Tyme Hardcore\\" (Taang! Records, 1996). This album was a return to a more \\"old-school\\" hardcore sound and featured a cover of the classic SSD track \\"Get It Away\\" In July 1997, Slapshot played what was to be their last concert in the United States for five years, in Plymouth, Massachusetts. They toured Europe in 1999, including a stop at the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium. In December 1999, a Slapshot tribute album called Boston Drops the Gloves: A Tribute to Slapshot was released by Flat Records (the label owned by Ken Casey of the Dropkick Murphys) and San Francisco-based TKO Records. The album included covers by 22 Boston bands. In 2001, Slapshot issued a new album entitled Greatest Hits, Slashes and Crosschecks (King Fisher/Century Media) featuring re-recorded & re-mastered versions of classic Slapshot songs, which featured the only recordings of the band with David Link on bass and was the last recorded material with Mike Bowser on guitar. In 2002 Slapshot played a 15-minute surprise set at The Hideaway in Cambridge, MA as part of a bill alongside Poison Idea, Kill Your Idols, Thumbs Up! and more. The overall reaction to the short set resulted in a full show being booked at The Hideaway for October 13, 2002. Unfortunately the club was forced to close just days before the show was scheduled to happen. On October 26, 2002 Slapshot was finally able to play a full set in the US for the first time in over 5 years. The show was the \\"6th annual Back to School Jam\\" in Framingham, MA and also featured Blood for Blood, Converge, Reach The Sky, Panic, No Warning, Some Kind of Hate and a very rare set by Stars & Stripes. Around this time Mike Bowser decided to move to New York for a new job and after a guitar search that ended with Ed Lalli (currently singing for The Welch Boys) they returned to the studio for 2003's Digital Warfare (I Scream Records) followed by 2005's Tear It Down (Thorp Records), along with several more European tours. In 2006, Slapshot released a statement on their website announcing that the band was defunct. However, on June 30, 2007, they played at the Significant Fest 2007 in Clearwater, Florida. Also on the bill were Killing Time, 108 and Uppercut. In July 2008, they played a couple of dates in Europe, with a stop at the With Full Force festival in Leipzig, Germany. These were to be the last shows featuring Ed Lalli on guitar. Slapshot played a show at Anchors Up in Haverhill, Massachusetts on November 8, 2008 with Ten Yard Fight, Step Forward, and Word For Word. This show was a warm up for the 2008 Winter Tour with Energy and All For Nothing, which brought the return of longtime guitarist Mike Bowser and reformed the classic Olde Tyme Hardcore/16 Vale Hate line-up. Upon returning from the tour Slapshot played as part of the \\"2008 Hometown Throwdown\\" in Boston on December 28 at the Middle East with The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. One highlight of the show was Choke joining the Bosstones on stage during their cover of the Slapshot song \\"What‚Äôs at Stake\\". April 24, 2009 finally brought the world premiere of the long awaited Slapshot documentary film \\"Chip On My Shoulder: The Cautionary Tale of Slapshot\\". It premiered at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, MA to a sold out audience as part of the Boston Independent Film Festival. Following its premiere the film was screened as part of a hardcore festival in Toronto Canada which also featured performances by Negative Approach and Supertouch. The film was also screened at the Salt Lake City Film Festival in August 2009. The film was directed and produced by Ian McFarland (Blood for Blood) and Anthony \\"Wrench\\" Moreschi (Ten Yard Fight) of Killswitch Productions and will be released on DVD by Taang! Records eventually (we hope). After another line-up change (including Chris Lauria moving from bass to guitar) Slapshot headed back to Europe for 10 shows in August 2009 with the support of Frigate which features Chris Lauria of Slapshot, Linda Bean of Stars & Stripes and John Bean formerly of Bitter. The tour, dubbed the '2009 Replacements Tour', went well but late 2009 still brought about another line up change. The next line up of Slapshot included founding member Jack 'Choke' Kelly, longtime member Chris Laura (back on bass guitar), John Bean on drums and Craig Silverman (formerly of Only Living Witness & currently of The Enemy Within and the touring guitar player for Blood for Blood) on guitar. The band spent the first 1/2 of 2010 working on new material and hopes to have some new songs recorded before the end of the year. This line-up played the \\"Gallery East\\" reunion show in August 2010 after several warm-up shows in Europe. In 2012, another lineup change brought Nick Charrette in to play bass. June 6, 2012 The New 3 song EP \\"I Believe\\" will be released on TAANG! RECORDS it will be the 208th release for the label & the 11th release by the band SLAPSHOT on TAANG! Ryan Packer joined on bass in late 2012. Benny Grotto joined in November 2014. On March 18th 2019, Craig Silverman announced that he was quitting Slapshot via his Instagram page. Choke currently has at least three tattoos of pink haired anime girls.

The Gezira Scheme () is one of the largest irrigation projects in the world. It is centered on the Sudanese state of Al Jazirah, just southeast of the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers at the city of Khartoum. The Gezira Scheme was begun by the British while the area was governed as part of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Water from the Blue Nile is distributed through canals and ditches to tenant farms lying between the Blue and White Nile rivers. The Gezira (which means \\"island\\") is particularly suited to irrigation because the soil slopes away from the Blue Nile and water therefore naturally runs through the irrigation canals by gravity.Hyslop, J. (1952) : \\"The Sudan Story\\", Chapter \\"The Bounteous River\\", The Naldrett Press, London, UK The soil has a high clay content which keeps down losses from seepage. Reginald Wingate, the British governor-general of Sudan, originally envisaged the farmers growing wheat but this was abandoned as the colonial authorities thought that a better cash crop was needed. When it was discovered that Egyptian-type long staple cotton could be grown, this was welcomed as a better choice as it would also provide a raw material for the British textile industry. Cotton was first grown in the area in 1904. After many experiments with irrigation, was put under cultivation in 1914. After the lowest Nile flood for 200 years, the Sennar Dam was constructed on the Blue Nile to provide a reservoir of water. This dam was completed in 1925 and is about long. The Gezira Scheme was initially financed by the Sudan Plantations Syndicate in London and later the British government guaranteed capital to develop it. The Sudan Gezira Board took over from private enterprise in 1950 and was chaired by Arthur Gaitskell. Farmers cooperated with the Sudanese government and the Gezira Board.

It is also known as nil per os (npo or NPO), a Latin phrase that translates literally to English as \\"nothing through the mouth\\". Variants include nil by mouth (NBM), nihil/non/nulla per os, or complete bowel rest. A liquid-only diet may also be referred to as bowel rest. NPO is one of the abbreviations that is not used in AMA style; \\"nothing by mouth\\" is spelled out instead.  Purpose  The typical reason for NPO instructions is the prevention of aspiration pneumonia, e.g. in those who will undergo general anesthesia, or those with weak swallowing musculature, or in case of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal blockage, or acute pancreatitis. Alcohol overdoses that result in vomiting or severe external bleeding also warrant NPO instructions for a period.  Duration  Pre-surgery NPO orders are typically between 6 and 12 hours prior to surgery, through recovery suite discharge, but may be longer if long acting medications or oral post-meds were administered. It is not uncommon for the food NPO period to be longer than that for liquid, as the American Board of Anesthesiology advises against liquid NPO periods greater than eight hours. The NPO periods for illness tend to be much longer, although exceptions are made for small scheduled amounts of water consumption if an IV drip is not in use. With sufficient IV fluids, NPO periods of several days have been utilized successfully in non-diabetic patients (although short NPO periods in diabetics are possible with IV fluids, insulin, and dextrose. Extended periods (greater than 12 hours) are still contraindicated. The American Board of Anesthesiology recommends that patients should not eat solid food for at least 8 hours prior to a procedure, and should not drink even clear liquids for at least 2 hours prior. Clear liquid fasting includes water, juices without pulp, carbonated beverages, clear tea, and black coffee.Levy, DM. Pre-operative fasting ‚Äì 60 years on from Mendelson. Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care Pain (2006) 6 (6): 215-218 Ingestion of water 2 hours prior to a procedure results in smaller gastric volumes and higher gastric pH when compared with those who ingested > 4 hours prior. The volume of liquid is less important than the type of liquid ingested. Non-emergency surgical cases should be delayed for NPO status. For extended periods without food or water, patients may be started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Unrestricted clear fluids Fasting guidelines often restrict the intake of any oral fluid after two to six hours preoperatively. However, it has been demonstrated in a large retrospective analysis in Torbay Hospital that unrestricted clear oral fluids right up until transfer to theatre could significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting without an increased risk in the adverse outcomes for which such conservative guidance exists.

It is west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. Concord is known as the 'Parklands Suburb' of the Inner West. Concord West is a separate suburb, to the north- west. History Concord takes its name from Concord, Massachusetts, in the USA, which was the site of the Battle of Concord, one of the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1778). Some historians believe the Sydney suburb was named Concord to encourage a peaceful attitude between soldiers and settlers. The first land grants in the area were made in 1793.Frances Pollon, The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Angus and Robertson, 1990, p.68 The original Concord Council was established in 1883. Concord Council amalgamated with Drummoyne Council in 2000 after 117 years of self governance to form the City of Canada Bay. It is also the name of the surrounding parish. In 1933, 'Concord Jubilee 1833 - 1933: a history of the municipality of Concord: with illustrations', compiled by G. M. Shaw was published. Commercial area Concord features Majors Bay Road Shopping Village. It includes several cafes, restaurants, Coles supermarket, post office, medical centre and other commercial enterprises. There is also a small shopping strip on Cabarita Road known as 'Cabarita Junction' and just up the road as you head towards Breakfast point you will find a small cafe and restaurant precinct on the corner of Mortlake Street and Brays Road.thumb  Churches  St Luke's Anglican Church is one of the oldest churches in Concord. The church is over 150 years old and is located at Burton Street near Concord Oval.St Luke‚Äôs Anglican Church Concord's 150th birthday celebration Its current organ was donated by Dame Eadith Walker, of the famous Walker family on her 21st birthday in 1883.St Luke's Concord St Mary's Catholic Church is a prominent architectural landmark on Parramatta Road.St Mary's Catholic Parish Concord The first church on the site was built in 1845 until a new church was built in 1874. A school operated in the original church building until a separate school building was built and opened by Cardinal Moran in 1894. A convent for the Sisters of Charity was erected next to the church in 1898. The present church building was completed in 1929. Parks Concord has many parks, including: * Queen Elizabeth Park (formerly known as 'Concord Park', renamed to honour Queen Elizabeth II after her visit to Australia in 1954) * Henley Park (site of the former general cemetery - 1938) * Majors Bay Reserve, including Arthur Walker and Ron Routly Reserves (beginning of the Concord Foreshore Trail). * Concord Golf Course, Massey Park, Cintra Park * Concord Oval (home ground of Inter Lions Soccer Club and the West Harbour Pirates Rugby Union Club, training ground of Wests Tigers NRL club) * Sid Richards Park (home ground of the Concord Comets Baseball Club) * Central Park, St Lukes Park, Bayview Park, Edwards Park, Greenlees Park, Goddard Park, Rothwell Park. Transport State Transit and Transit Systems operate 9 routes via Concord: *439 & L39: Mortlake to the City via Five Dock & Leichhardt *458: Burwood station to Ryde *460: Concord Hospial to Five Dock *464: Mortlake to Ashfield station *466: Cabarita Park to Ashfield station via Bayview Park *502: Bayview Park to the City via Victoria Road *526: One weekday service from Concord High School to Olympic Park wharf via Burwood & Strathfield *410: Hurstville via Campsie, Burwood and Ryde to Marsfield Concord West railway station & North Strathfield railway station service the Concord area. The stops are on the Northern line approximately 14 km (9 miles) from Central Station. Sydney Ferries service the Concord area stopping at Cabarita Wharf. Concord was once serviced by an independent tram line which ran from Mortlake and Cabarita junction through Majors Bay Road, Concord, though to Burwood Road (formerly Wharf Street on the Concord side of Parramatta Road) south though Burwood CBD and terminating at Enfield, its most southern point. This tram system did not join with the rest of the Sydney wide tram network which ceased operating in the early 1960s. Bus services between Mortlake/Breakfast Point and Cabarita to Burwood (and eventually to Ashfield via Enfield, i.e. routes 464 and 466) follow the old tram lines through the suburb, which were removed in 1948. Few hints of Concord's trams remain today apart from the extra width of Majors Bay Road and Brewer Street in order to accommodate a double track tramway and the existence of Tramway Lane and Cabarita Junction which is where the tram tracks split, with one track providing the Mortlake branch and the other the Cabarita branch.

It is situated about south from York, on the west back of the River Ouse; near the opposite bank is the settlement of Stillingfleet, and to the north-west is Appleton Roebuck. History The name is derived from the Latin word for a camp, 'castra', indicating that the Roman army may once have been based near here. There is no longer any signs of such an encampment which was thought to have provided protection of the waterway to Tadcaster. The use of Selby indicates that the lands were brought within the control of Selby Abbey. This was done by Osbert de Arches at the time of the Norman Conquest and confirmed in the reign of Richard I. The village is listed in the Domesday Book as Acastre in the wapentake of Ainsty in the West Riding of Yorkshire, having 11 households under the lordship of Wulstan, who was replaced by Robert Malet in 1086. College Farm at Acaster Selby is named after a former college, or a chantry, which was dissolved during the reign of Henry VIII. The site of the St Andrew's College, to the north-east of the farm, is a scheduled monument and includes extensive earthworks of buildings and a moated enclosure. Geography The village has an area of . It lies south-east of Appleton Roebuck. Demography According to the 1881 census the population was 115.

Accott is an historic estate, now a small settlement, in the parish of Bishop's Tawton in the county of Devon, England  History  The place-name Accott is reputed to have come from an Anglo-Saxon landowner called Acca, who \\"once owned a sizeable estate in this district\\",Acland, Anne. A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands. London and Chichester: Phillimore, 1981, p.2 thus \\"Acca's Cott\\" (Acca's farmstead) (See List of generic forms in place names in Ireland and the United Kingdom). He also owned nearby Acland, Landkey, 3 miles to the west, the original seat of the prominent Acland family, which manor's name signifies \\"Acca's lane\\".Acland, Anne, p.2 Persons with this name living in the 8th century included three bishops in the Anglo-Saxon Church: Acca of Dunwich (8th century), Acca of Hereford (8th century) and Acca of Hexham (b c. 660 - 740 or 742), or Saint Acca. The mansion house at Accott has a Grade II listed private chapel. it is believed to date from the 12th century. The house became derelict in the 1950s. The chapel is located at the western end of the house and was used for Roman Catholic services when the Giffards lived there in the late 16th century following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The senior branch of the Giffard family was seated at nearby Brightley in the adjoining parish of Chittlehampton. The estate comprised several farms and formed part of the manor of Bishop's Tawton, held in-chief by the Bishop of Exeter. A document states that Accott was held by Richard Cotell from a feudal overlord named Drogo de Lington in 1127 after his ancestors were granted the estate by a Bishop of Exeter. Alice Cotell gave it in exchange for a sore goshawk 150 years later and a life annuity to John Giffard, whose family owned it for a further 100 years. In 1890 cannonballs were found embedded in the wall by workmen during repairs to the house. They indicate that Accott may have been the scene of a battle, probably during the Civil War (1642‚Äì1651). It was then sold by three sisters and joint-heiresses who had inherited the estate following the death of their two brothers who killed each other in a quarrel. For a further 300 years the prominent Chichester family of Hall (in the same parish) owned the farm up until the early 20th century. The Chichester estate had to sell Accot in order to pay Estate Duty. Both farms were bought by the Lee family, who used the house for storage.http://www.uklanddirectory.org.uk/land-for-sale.asp?id=2963  References  External links Category:Villages in Devon Category:Historic estates in Devon ","title":"Accott"},{"id":"2597656","text":"Holy Name Cathedral or the Cathedral of the Holy Name are the names of several cathedrals. * Holy Name Cathedral, Brisbane (never completed) * Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago * Holy Name Cathedral, Mumbai * Holy Name Cathedral (Steubenville, Ohio)  See also  * Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral (disambiguation) ","title":"Holy Name Cathedral"},{"id":"2597663","text":"Ying Wa Girls' School () is an HKCCCC secondary day school for girls in Central, Hong Kong.

YWGS - view from sky Founder Miss Helen Davies Ying Wa Girls' School New Campus Robinson Road Campus Auditorium After a long journey, Ying Wa has eventually embarked on a new page of its history in mid-March 2019 with the ‚ÄúBig Move‚Äù from the decanting site of Sham Shui Po back to Robinson Road. The present campus comprises two sites: The Robinson Road Campus (Site A) stretching from Robinson Road all the way down to near Bonham Road, and the newly-acquired Breezy Path Campus (Site B).  History  Ying Wa Girls' School was founded in February 1900 by Helen Davies of the former London Missionary Society. This Society was founded in 1795. The School started as a boarding school for girls and expanded to include a secondary school section in 1915 and a two-year kindergarten in 1916. The School was referred to in English as ‚ÄòTraining Home‚Äô. It was not until 1920 that the name of Ying Wa Girls‚Äô school was officially adopted. The School started as a privately run school with a boarding section for primary pupils. However, it ceased taking on boarders in 1940. In 1968, the primary school section closed and the School became a purely secondary school. In 1966, London Missionary Society was restructured to become the Council for World Mission and Ying Wa Girls' School became one of the affiliated schools of the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China.http://www.ywgs.edu.hk/SchoolHistory.html Ying Wa Girls' School was one of the first girls' schools in Hong Kong that proposed the establishment of the student union. Students were elected to represent their peers and worked to promote self-expression. As a missionary of the London Missionary Society, Miss Vera Silcocks (1902-1977) came by boat from England to Hong Kong in 1927 to teach in the School. She spoke fluent Cantonese. In 1939, she became the Headmistress of the School. In December 1941, Hong Kong fell upon the Japanese invasion in the Battle of Hong Kong. This Battle was a part of World War II. During the subsequent Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Miss Silcocks was held by the Japanese in the Stanley Internment Camp. After the War, in 1945, the School reopened. In 1947, Miss Silcocks returned to the School as Headmistress. In 1948, the School Council was established. In 1949, the Student Association was established. In 1967, Miss Silcocks retired and returned to England.http://www.ywgs.edu.hk/school-history =Relationship with Ying Wa College= Ying Wa College is a school for boys founded also by the London Missionary Society. The Principal of Ying Wa College, Mr. Allan Cheng, is a member of the Incorporated Management Committee of Ying Wa Girls' School, while Mr. Francis Kwan is also a member of the Committee of Ying Wa College.Ëã±ËèØÊõ∏Èô¢Ê†°Èï∑Â≠∏ÁîüÁæ©Âä©Ê∏ÖÊΩî (Chinese) School Motto Time is precious, treasure every minute.http://www.ywgs.edu.hk/SchoolMotto.html Uniform The school's uniform is a blue cheongsam, with silver school and house badges right under the hook of the collar. The school uniform of Ying Wa has a unique design. It is hemmed with wide dark blue lines along the bottom hem, sleeve and collar; and the stiff collar, a bit higher than others, is tailored to allow little space between the collar and the neck. Students complain about how tight the collar is around their necks yet the school has a strict rule about keeping the collar straight at all times, even during the hottest summers. New students have had to get used to the uniform when they first attended the school. However, the uniform remains to be one of the most iconic parts of the school and a source of pride for its graduates. Robinson Road New Campus Class structure and curriculum There are altogether 30 classes in the school. Form 1: 5 classes (A,B,C,D,E) Form 2: 5 classes Form 3: 5 classes Form 4: 5 classes (NSS Curriculum) Form 5: 5 classes (NSS Curriculum) Form 6: 5 classes (NSS Curriculum) Secondary One to Three offer a broad general curriculum with a good balance among languages, arts, science, cultural and practical subjects as well as religious education and physical education. In Secondary Four to Six (NSS curriculum), students can choose 3 electives from a range of 15 subjects besides the 4 core subjects: Chinese, English, Mathematics and Liberal Studies. Students will take the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination at the end of Secondary Six for admission to tertiary institutes through the Joint University Programmes Admission System (JUPAS). As an E.M.I. (English as the Medium of Instruction) school, Ying Wa adopts English as the teaching medium in most subjects with the aim of achieving biliteracy (Chinese and English) and trilingualism with the inclusion of Putonghua. All subjects, except Chinese Language, Chinese Language and Culture, Chinese Literature, Chinese History, Religious Education, Physical Education and Putonghua, are taught in English. Lessons are arranged on a 5-day week basis. Toastmaster Leadership Training Programmes, Oral English Classes, Public Speaking Classes and Instrument Classes are offered after school and on Saturdays. Student Association Established by former principal, Miss Silcocks, in 1949, the Student Association is one of the oldest student bodies among local schools. For years the Student Association has nurtured generations of student leaders and promoted self-government. The association aims at fostering students‚Äô sense of belonging to the school by organising a wide variety of extracurricular activities. At present, the well-established association is composed of a nine-member Executive Committee and five sub-committees, namely the Press Committee, the Programme Committee, the Promotion Committee, the Sports Committee and the Welfare Committee. All committee members are elected by schoolmates in late September every year. Executive Committee =Press Committee= The school newsletter, Clarion, is published by the Press Committee three times a year. It gives students a platform to exchange ideas, share their experiences and feel connected to each other. The newsletter covers a range of topics, from stories of personal growth to insights on current and regional or global news. The paper encourages students to think critically and form opinions after thorough research. In recent years, the committee started a feature on interviews with the teachers and the administrative staff. The publication bridges the gap between the faculty and its students. =Sports Committee= The Sports Committee aims at promoting sports and stirring students‚Äô interests in sports. The Committee organises inter-class competitions, the Graduation Cup and various sports competitions. The Sports Committee and Inter-house Committee also co-organise the annual Athletics Meet and Swimming Gala. Students are strongly encouraged to engage in sports and lead active lives. =Promotion Committee= The Promotion Committee provides publicity to activities organised by the Student Association. At Thanksgiving Week and Christmas, decorations and ornaments can be seen virtually at every corner on campus to bring the festivities to the campus. =Programme Committee= The Programme Committee coordinates a variety of interest clubs and encourages students to participate in club activities. At the beginning of the school year, it helps with the recruitment of club members and officials. To facilitate their work, the committee offers workshops to train club officials and supervises their activities. At the end of the year, ECA records of students are collated and feedback is given to clubs to assist them with their future plans. =Welfare Committee= The Welfare Committee aims at providing welfare benefits to its students. Book sales are arranged regularly to provide students with stationery, such as exercise books and writing paper. PE uniform sales are held before the Athletics Meet and the Swimming Gala. Moreover, the Welfare Committee negotiates discounts with shops and businesses near the school. Credit must be given to the hard work of the committee so that students can now enjoy preferential rates at various restaurants and buy bargain items at the annual stationery sale. House system There are five Houses, named after the five early principals of the school: *Davies (green) *Hogben (yellow) *Hutchinson (blue) *Silcocks (orange) *Jenkins (red) Each house is represented by two house captains. The houses compete with each other on sports day and at the swimming gala. The aim of establishing the house system is to strengthen the students' ties to the school. YWGS Robinson Road entrance Redevelopment of campus YWGS Breezy Path Campus Since its establishment in 1900 by the London Missionary Society, Ying Wa Girls' School has been serving at its present site, providing education with a Christian character to young girls (and boys for a brief period) of Hong Kong of all classes. In December 2009, Ying Wa announced its redevelopment project. Supported by the Education Bureau, a new campus will replace the existing one on the same Robinson Road-Bonham Road site which has housed the school for over a century. On completion, available ground area will be expanded by about 50%, thus making it possible to overcome the recurring and constant lack of space since the founding. New spacious facilities and advanced installations will help Ying Wa take on the increasing demands of a fast-changing and diversified secondary curriculum. In November 2011, Ying Wa Girls' School received HK$10 million from the Li Ka Shing Foundation. It was used to establish the Li Chong Yuet Ming Student Development Fund to provide opportunities for students to become global citizens through international exchanges and strengthen their commitment to the local community through social service, in line with the school motto \\"To serve and not to be served.\\" The fund was named after Madam Amy Li Chong Yuet- ming, wife of Li Ka Shing, who attended the school.

Cavendish tobacco is named after Sir Thomas Cavendish. The varieties of tobacco leaves most commonly used to create Cavendish tobacco are Virginia, and Burley. The flavorings include sugar, cherry, maple, honey, licorice, chocolate, coconut, rum, strawberry, vanilla, walnut and bourbon.  Process  The preparation of Cavendish tobacco begins by pressing the tobacco leaves into a cake approximately 2.5 cm (1 in) thick. Then the cake is heated using fire or steam, allowing the tobacco to ferment. After, the fermented cakes are cut into slices and packed into pipes (a large wooden barrel). Finally, flavoring may be added before the leaves are pressed again. English Cavendish uses a dark flue or fire cured Virginia, which is steamed and then stored under pressure to allow it to cure and ferment for several days or weeks.

There are thus two different lineups of Mortal Kombat comics: the tie-ins published by Midway (some of them made by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias) and DC Comics that closely followed the storyline of the games, and the Malibu series, which took a few liberties with the source material. Comics published by Midway Games The Midway comics were tie-ins published to coincide with the launches of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 4. They offered insight into the backstory to each of the games as well as providing exposition of events occurring before each game. Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition Midway's comic book prologue to the original Mortal Kombat was only released by mail order when the original arcade version was released in 1992. The mail order deal was displayed during the attract mode of the game. (This mode of advertising was also used in Mortal Kombat II.) The comic book would later be sold normally around the country, although it was close to impossible to get a copy outside of the United States. The comic was written and illustrated by John Tobias, the early Mortal Kombat series' designer artist. The final few pages offer character profiles for the seven playable characters in the original MK and the boss, Goro. The comic begins by filling in the backstory of Shang Tsung, the Great Kung Lao, and Goro, whose victory in Mortal Kombat had meant a new dark era for the tournament. In the present day, where Liu Kang receives permission from Master Wu to fight in Mortal Kombat. Two weeks later, in Hong Kong, he boards a boat that will take him to the tournament island. Johnny Cage is also seen there, reassuring his agent and personal secretary who are afraid for his safety and the legitimacy of the tournament. Meanwhile, Kano and some members of his Black Dragon attempt to evade Sonya Blade, Agent Beran (whose name is not revealed here), and a man who is apparently Jax, as well as the rest of a U.S. Special Forces unit. Chased by Sonya, Kano leaps aboard the boat, all in accordance with his plan to loot all the riches he can find from Shang Tsung's palace. In the mountains of rural Japan, Shang Tsung issues a challenge to Raiden, God of Thunder, inviting him to compete and reminding him that the tournament will be fought in his domain and under his rule. Back on the boat, Kano is trying to intimidate Cage and a fight breaks out, during which Liu Kang takes down Kano's associates. Sub-Zero watches the scene from above, unaware of the lurking spectre of Scorpion, who ambushes him from behind. Scorpion vows to kill Sub-Zero just as Sub-Zero killed Scorpion exactly two years ago. However, he states he is no mere murderer and, instead of killing the Sub-Zero on the boat, he will do so at the tournament. Sub-Zero says Scorpion is a fool to spare his life. At the island, after a day of practice and training, Shang Tsung and Goro welcome the participants in the tournament and introduce the latest entrant, Sonya Blade, who had been trying to track Kano down to the island, but was captured and brought in by guards. Shang Tsung says that not only does Sonya's life depend on her performance, but so do the lives of her accompanying unit, who have also been captured. Goro then announces the start of the tournament and the story ends with the caption \\"To be continued...at an arcade near you!\\" =Mortal Kombat II Collector's Edition= Midway's comic book prologue to Mortal Kombat II was published by mail order during the release of the arcade version, much like with the original game's comic. Likewise, the second comic book reflects the events that were raised in the game and was also written, penciled, and colored by John Tobias. Scorpion's role in the comic is contradictory to both his character ending in the MKII video game and to his role in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. In addition, Shaolin Monks intro sequence and first level are in contradiction to the opening few pages of the comic (wherein Johnny Cage offers up a largely different scenario). The story begins with Johnny Cage recounting the events of the first game's final moments. He explains that Shang Tsung unleashed a horde of warriors on the Earthrealm fighters following Liu Kang's victory over Goro; and that Kano, Sonya, and himself were rushed by Goro at The Pit. Suddenly, an explosion knocked out the bridge from underneath them and everyone fell. Cage was saved, however, by Raiden, who informed him that Liu Kang had killed Shang Tsung and the island, which was held together by Tsung's presence, is self-destructing. Raiden further elaborates that Liu Kang has already escaped and, following the battle with Shang Tsung's army, Sub-Zero was killed by Scorpion, who then burst into flames and burned to ash before Raiden's eyes. The ensuing explosion apparently knocked Cage out and the next thing he recalls is seeing a U.S. military vessel. As it turns out, Cage has been telling the story to a disbelieving Jax and Lt. Steve Beran (a reference to Mortal Kombat series art director Steve Beran), who is more open to the story considering Cage has recounted the story five times with exactly the same details each time. Jax does not believe Cage's story on account of a distress signal from Sonya pinpointed to where they found Cage and because he thinks Sonya would never fight alongside Kano, even if, as Cage says, she had no choice. He nevertheless releases Cage due to lack of evidence. Meanwhile, in Outworld, Shao Kahn is being addressed by King Gorbak, who laments his son, Goro's, apparent death and places the blame on the shoulders of Shang Tsung, who is alive in Outworld. Gorbak calls for Tsung's death, but Kahn gives the him one chance to impress upon him why he should not personally slay him. Tsung instantly comes up with a plan: to lure the Earthrealm warriors to Outworld by breaching the dimensional gate and challenging them to Mortal Kombat. Only this time, the tournament will take place in Outworld and will be against the wishes of the Elder Gods. Kahn consults a Shadow Priest for advice and is told that due to the plan being against the wishes of the Elder Gods, it is impossible to clearly foresee the outcome. Should Kahn be victorious, his power will be unmatched and he will live for eternity. If the plan fails, however, Kahn will face eternal damnation. Gorbak says that if Tsung is to live then he will offer the services of Kintaro. As Shang Tsung's presence on Earthrealm no longer exists, Shao Kahn gives him a new physical form, one that is much younger in appearance. Kahn then sends Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Kintaro, and Shang Tsung to destroy the Shaolin Monastery. At the Special Forces base, a recording is received from Sonya and Kano that confirms Cage's story as true. Jax decides to make a trip to Hollywood to track down Cage. In China, Liu Kang has returned to Shaolin to find it ruined. The apparent sole survivor of the attacks, Kung Lao, appears from the shadows and sides with his friend by offering his word that he will fight against Outworld. At that moment, a Lin Kuei hover jet lands and a man in a suit claiming to be Sub-Zero hands Liu Kang his calling card. Liu Kang states that he saw Sub-Zero die and this man cannot possibly be the same person, but the ninja says he is the brother of the original Sub-Zero and remarks that his brother's unwillingness to adapt to technological change within the Lin Kuei is what made him obsolete. He shows the monks surveillance pictures the Lin Kuei took of Shang Tsung who appears to be searching for Cage, and the three then decide to journey to Hollywood. Cage is on set, filming a commercial for \\"Cage Cologne.\\" (The director's name is \\"E. Boon\\" and bears resemblance to the franchise co- creator of the same name whilst the cameraman looks like fellow co-creator John Tobias.) At this point, Shang Tsung and the Outworld warriors sent by Kahn, flanked by numerous Masked Guards, arrive through a portal in the studio. As Jax and Beran demand to see Cage, he is blasted through the wall right in front of them and a massive fight breaks out. Sub-Zero's hover jet arrives about this time, being piloted by Smoke and a red-clad Lin Kuei member. Kung Lao and Liu Kang join the fight on Jax's side. Sub-Zero (now in his ninja uniform) leaps down and makes an attempt on Shang Tsung's life, but rebounds off an invisible Reptile. Before Reptile can kill Sub-Zero, however, Scorpion intervenes and attacks Reptile, saying he will defend Sub-Zero as penance for killing his brother. Before anything else can happen, though, Raiden arrives to stop the conflict. Shang Tsung now makes his challenge before returning to Outworld with his allies, leaving the Earthrealm warriors with the choice of accepting the challenge or forfeiting. Raiden informs Liu Kang that forfeit would weaken Earthrealm's standing with the Elder Gods and Liu Kang must accept the challenge. Jax is reluctant to join the tournament but is spurred on when Cage reveals Beran has been killed by Mileena. Sub-Zero also offers to compete. Raiden tells the gathered group of Jax, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, and Sub-Zero to \\"Prepare yourselves, Mortals‚Äîfor Kombat in the Outworld!\\" The comic ends with the caption, \\"To be continued on a game screen near you!\\" =Mortal Kombat 4 Limited Edition= This comic book/artbook hybrid was created jointly by artists Al√© Garza, Tomm Coker, Keron Grant, Garry Leach, Steve Pugh, and Mark Texeira. It serves as a prologue to Mortal Kombat 4. Shinnok, ruler of the Netherrealm, is the first to emerge from the portal, followed by hundreds of demons, as well as the mysterious Reiko, and Scorpion, who is likely looking for another chance at life outside the Netherrealm. As Quan Chi, the one who gave Sindel the orb, discusses the success of the plan and says Tanya is to be thanked, Shinnok claims his true goal is to reach the heavens and confront the Elder Gods, and now he has that chance. Several days later, in Earthrealm, Sub-Zero has travelled to the Temple of the Elements in China. He recalls what his elder brother, the original Sub-Zero, said: that the temple is home to an amulet designed to keep Shinnok in the Netherrealm. The amulet is protected by the elements of Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire (a reference to Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero). As Sub-Zero prepares to make peace with the elemental Gods, he sees what he believes to be a sign falling from the sky and decides to follow it after symbolically donning his mask once more out of respect not to the Lin Kuei, but to his brother. Miles away, Liu Kang quickly gets the upper hand, Kai jokes that this is easy enough for the Immortal Champion of Mortal Kombat. Suddenly, what Sub-Zero had seen falling from the sky collides with the ground near the monks. They inspect the scene and discover demons about to slit the throat of a white-haired man. Elsewhere, Sonya Blade is battling Jarek. Unable to get the upper hand over the last remaining Black Dragon clan member, Jarek escapes. Jax then contacts Sonya and tells her she is needed to investigate an interdimensional flux in southwestern China and a helicopter piloted by Johnny Cage is sent to pick her up. At the crater, Liu Kang and Kai battle the demons until Raiden shows up and destroys the demons. Raiden then explains that the man who fell from the sky is Fujin, God of Wind. He elaborates that he and Fujin are the last two remaining of Earth's Gods and that the Elder Gods have been weakened by Shinnok. He and Fujin withdraw to the Eternal Palace to formulate a plan of attack, after telling Liu Kang and Kai they must go to Edenia. Just as Kai is lamenting the impossibility of such a task, the helicopter carrying Sonya and Cage arrives. Sub-Zero too shows up to offer his help, correctly guessing that his brother may have played some part in Shinnok's return. Sonya uses Outer World Investigation Agency technology to open a portal to Edenia. On the other side, they are all greeted by Quan Chi, who welcomes the Earthrealm Warriors to a \\"Mortal Kombat like you've never seen before.\\" The comic ends with the caption, \\"To be continued in Mortal Kombat 4.\\" Comics published by Malibu Comics Comics published by DC Comics =Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe: Beginnings= This short comic was illustrated by returning John Tobias and written by John Vogel, another of the original four co-creators of the Mortal Kombat franchise. It is the backstory comic for the 2008 game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, merging the worlds of Mortal Kombat and the DC Universe. =Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties= DC Comics announced a prequel comic book series for Mortal Kombat X that \\"will feature many favorite characters and the next generation of Kombatants\\" as being written by Shawn Kittelsen with interior art by Dexter Soy and covers by Ivan Reis. The series debuted in January 2015. Blood Ties begins several years after the end of the \\"Netherrealm War\\", when Shinnok led Netherrealm in an attempt to conquer Earth and the other realms in the wake of Shao Khan's death. Shinnok was defeated and his undead armies pushed back, save for a number of dead warriors who were restored to life. Meanwhile, Outworld fell into a civil war as Mileena was overthrown by her warchief Kotal Kahn. In the Himalayan wilderness, Kenshi and his son Takeda flee from members of the Red Dragon and are saved by Scorpion and his rebuilt Shirai Ryu clan. Kenshi explains that he was infiltrating the Red Dragon when he was exposed, causing the group to target his son, whom he did not know he had. Kenshi leaves Takeda with Scorpion and leaves to complete his mission and find the Red Dragon's leader. Meanwhile, Kuai Liang, the younger Sub-Zero (who has also been returned to life) attacks a Red Dragon Temple in China. He enters the inner chamber only to be attacked by Kano, who has taken the Kamidogu (which are daggers in this timeline) within and scars him with it, stating that the Kamidogu are cursed. Years later, Scorpion is approached by Raiden. After ensuring the Kamidogu is safe, he warns Scorpion of a demon from another realm that seeks to kill Earth's champions. Takeda's friend Fox is driven mad by voices: taking the Kamidogu, he is possessed by the demon and kills the rest of the Shirai Ryu, before being killed by Takeda and Scorpion. After paying their respects to the fallen, the two leave to find Raiden to seek answers. At the Sky Temple, Raiden converses with the Wind God Fujin, before using another dagger to invoke blood magic to find the demon. He discovers that they are too late and that events are already in motion. At a Special Forces base, Sonya Blade meets with Kotal Khan, Emperor of Outworld, who was captured entering Earth. Kotal explains that Mileena's resistance in Outworld is in league with the Red Dragon, and that he and his warriors are there to eliminate them. He asks for their cooperation, though Sonya refuses, and a fight ensues, but Raiden intervenes and Kotal departs, threatening to make them pay. Elsewhere, Sonya's daughter Cassie Cage, takes Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs to what she believes to be a legal fight club, but are forced into an illegal death match against Frost. The match is interrupted by Black Dragon members Jarek and Tasia, who attempt to take Cassie and Jacqui. The two are sucked through a portal, but Cassie is able to take a picture of one of their abductors from her phone, Erron Black, one of the warriors who had been with Kotal, leaving it for Sonya. Sonya finds Cassie's phone and prepares to take her men and Johnny Cage (Cassie's father) to Outworld. In Outworld, Kotal Khan sends his father to find Prince Goro who has disappeared while looking for Mileena. Unknown to Kotal, Goro has betrayed him and joined Mileena. Goro kills Kotal's father, driving Kotal to empower himself with his Kamidogu and face Goro personally, tearing his arms off. As Kotal and his warriors leave, they are confronted by Sonya demanding her daughter's location. Kotal denies involvement but agrees to help after Erron Black is shown to be involved. Elsewhere, Erron, Kano and the Black Dragon are taking Jacqui and Cassie to an unknown location when they are ambushed by Mavado and the Red Dragon. Kano abandons Erron who is wounded and the girls kill Mavado before being taken prisoner once more. In Earthrealm, Scorpion and Takeda near the Sky Temple and are attacked by Raiden, who is under the effects of the Kamidogu's curse. Takeda is seemingly killed, causing Scorpion to savagely beat Raiden, freeing him from the curse. Raiden saves Takeda's life and explains that following Shinnok's defeat the Elder Gods locked him away in another dimension. The Kamidogu were empowered with Blood Magic to act as the keys to his prison, and entrusted to powerful warriors by Raiden, keeping their true purpose and power hidden. Scorpion is furious at the deception. Raiden apologizes, explaining that he had not foreseen the demon corrupting the magic and cursing the blades. He informs him that all the blades are accounted for, save for one which has been stolen by Sub-Zero, who was possessed when Kano scarred him with one years earlier, and Scorpion agrees to help track him down. In Outworld, Mileena's chief advisor Reiko plots with the demon cleric Havik, who promises to grant him the power to become ruler of Outworld if he brings him the Kamidogu. Meanwhile, Sonya's team finds Erron Black who delivers a message that Reiko and Havik are waiting for them on Shang Tsung's island.

Hosted by Elliot Spencer, it was aimed at an older audience than that for ABC For Kids. Rollercoaster was a \\"wrapper\\" show, usually incorporating three to five externally produced animated programs (formerly a mix of animated and live action shows) of varying lengths, which were interspersed with locally produced studio or location segments hosted by Spencer. It was aimed at older children and young teenaged audiences. The host, Elliot Spencer was usually the sole presenter, dressing up as characters for short sketches sometimes; on occasion members of Rollercoaster crew also appear in gags and sketches. The show also included regular features jointly presented by Spencer and Ruben Meerman, \\"The Surfing Scientist\\". Rollercoaster followed a well- established format for Australian children's television. In order to comply with government-mandated Australian content regulations, local broadcasters have traditionally engaged a local presenter or team of presenters to \\"wrap\\" (or \\"top and tail\\") pre-produced segments such as cartoons. These shows offer a relatively inexpensive means of filling children's viewing times on Australian TV‚Äîthe wrapper segments are generally made with a small crew and feature minimal production values; in the early days of Australian television the wrapper segments were performed live, although today they are now usually pre-recorded. The outsourced content is often purchased at relatively low cost, and for many decades Australian networks have been offered package-deal rates by American production houses and networks, as an incentive to purchase bundled content. The 'outsourced' segments of the show were most commonly short animated series. Many of these programs are produced outside Australia with most sourced from other English-speaking countries, chiefly the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. RollerCoaster alternates these short programs (e.g. Shaun the Sheep, The Mr. Men Show) with longer animated or live-action children's programs in a variety of genres, such as Roman Mysteries, Wolverine and the X-Men, Naturally Sadie, Young Dracula, and more recently, the children's reality competition Escape from Scorpion Island. Such programs are usually produced for American or Canadian commercial or cable TV and are structured to allow the insertion of advertising breaks, so they have a slightly shorter running time on Rollercoaster, since the ABC carries no external advertising. The locally produced portions of RollerCoaster featuring Spencer featured a number of recurring segments including: \\"Fetch\\", \\"Feed Me\\", \\"Now Poll\\", \\"MEE News\\", and \\"The Surfing Scientist\\" and \\"Professor Slo and Doctor Mo\\". Many of these segments included elements of audience participation or contributions via email or the RollerCoaster website's moderated chat rooms and message boards. On 30 January 2010, Elliot Spencer announced he was leaving the show after five years of hosting, the ABC decided not to replace him and end the show completely. The show has been succeeded by Studio 3.  History  = Beginning = The series began in January 2005, filling a slot once occupied by The Afternoon Show. It broke over the Australian summer school holidays and was replaced by a special Christmas line-up. During the holidays there were generally three or four popular shows repeated every day, rather than interchanging every day. Sometimes instead of the usual three or four shows a 'special' would be shown. These included 'double episodes' of Degrassi: The Next Generation and the Edgar and Ellen Specials. Wallace and Gromit stop motion animation movies were shown as well. Each year, the last week of Rollercoaster would air Christmas related programmes or holiday themed episodes of series which have aired on the show previously. = Broadcast = Graphics for the studio segments are produced using Chroma key or green screen technology. This means many gags, information segments, and backgrounds, can be used and changed quickly. Props are kept to a minimum, like in the Feed Me segment where a preparation table and mixing bowl are used, or in Chatter and other segments where a retro style yellow table appears, now a Rollercoaster signed table with green and black stripes on the front and a storage on the back. = Rewind = From Monday 19 June 2006, Rollercoaster Rewind began on ABC1 in early weekday mornings, the show repeated the programming from four months earlier in reverse order originally until from 9 July 2007, where this was changed so that the programmes were aired in the correct order, though later again reverted to reverse order. Because Rollercoaster Rewind runs in the non-ratings season and the regular show does not, in early 2008 Rollercoaster Rewind caught up to the current broadcast of Rollercoaster, resulting in the ABC replacing their early morning programming by other series until 'Rewind' resumed from where it left off. On Friday 21 December 2007, the last show of RollerCoaster aired for that year, returning on Monday 25 February 2008 for its first show of the new year. = Revamp = From 2 March 2009, the show moved from its previous time slot of 5:00‚Äì6:00 p.m. AEST, and moved down an hour earlier, from 4:00‚Äì5:00 p.m.. The presentation also changed to filming in a real set in contrast to previously, where they would film in front of a green screen with closed captions. It remained a wrapper program, and the segments remained the same, however the programs were no longer interchanged, and each day featured the same line-up of shows. Another change was that it only included animation now, with live action shows not \\"boxed\\" by the Rollercoaster format and were seen following in the 5pm-6pm slot. = ABC3 = From 7 December 2009, Rollercoaster began airing on the then recently launched children-orientated multi-channel ABC3 following the original screening on its sister channel ABC1 from 4-5pm. A Rollercoaster Rewind carbon copy version of the show entitled Rollercoaster on Vacation aired on ABC3 during the 09‚Äì10 Australian school holidays. = Ending = At the end of the Friday 29 January 2010 edition, Spencer announced that he was leaving the show and thanked viewers for his five years as presenter and writer of the series. By the same date, the main Rollercoaster URL was redirecting visitors to the new ABC3 website; some pages including \\"Elliot's Blah\\" still function, though now carry the disclaimer that they are no long being updated as well as a link redirecting visitors to a new Rollercoaster section in the ABC3 site. Elliot sang a song entitled \\"Bye for now, forever!\\" and explained \\"it was a good five years\\".  Segments and features  Rollercoaster sometimes show special weeks either to celebrate an event or an incoming show, like Roma Week, which centres on the incoming show of Roman Mysteries in 2007; Christmas week, celebrating Christmas by showing programs relating to Christmas; magic week, celebrating magic by showing a magic trick done by a professional every episode. Theme weeks have also included Feed Me Week with Feed me being presented every day, also done in a similar way with Elliot and the Surfing Scientist on National Science Week. There have also been Sports Week, with Elliot finding out about different sports; and a character week when Elliot dressed up as characters that he has dressed up as before. In 2009 there are themed days as well as weeks. As well as special segments, special weeks and days are sometimes scheduled according to a general theme. In 2007 'All New Tuesday' made all shows shown on Tuesdays new, and on Thursday the theme was 'Rollertoons Day'. In 2008 'All New Tuesday' has been replaced by a new 'Rollertoons Day', Thursday shows are all Australian-made, Friday shows all have a \\"creepy\\" theme, and Mondays have been set aside purely for comedy shows as 'LOL Day'. This is no longer used in 2009 since the same shows are on each day of the week. One time, Elvis Presley (acted out by Elliot Spencer) was on Rollercoaster on Wednesday of June in 2009 and included a Whizz Quiz about Elvis and a NOW Excuses about Elvis' CD. Regular segments include: *'Feed Me', a cooking segment where Elliot attempts to cook and then try a recipe sent in by an audience member (on Wednesday) *'Feedback', when viewers send in letters to Elliot (on Tuesday and Thursday) *'Chatter', Elliot reads chats that had been sent on the website on a particular topic. He also reads jokes and acronyms (on Tuesday, sometimes) *'LOCIW' Elliot reads acronyms sent in by viewers (on Monday) *'Fetch', a segment where people send in their made-up words with their definitions. Elliot tries to put all these words into a weird anecdote (on Friday). *'What Career am I?', where Elliot gives clues and then reveals a career. He introduces someone that has that career and gives them a challenge. Similar segments called \\"Where in the world am I?\\" and \\"Which Olympian am I? Past or present\\" have also featured in the past. *'Elliot and The Surfing Scientist', where Elliot and Ruben Meerman do simple experiments (on Tuesday). *'El Lamo World Records', where viewers send in record attempts for Elliot to 'attempt but not necessarily complete' one or even two at once of these on air (on Tuesday, sometimes). *'Roller Tale', where viewers send in stories which must be about Elliot's fictional alter egos Tapioca Toe Maker and Pocket Waffle. These are acted out by Elliot (on Friday, now the story finished). *'Sponge Brain Quiz', a true or false quiz, shown before Naturally Sadie with nature-themed questions. In the past it has been about Roman Mysteries and Dinosapien and themed to these shows. Since Naturally Sadie ended, the Quiz is still present in the same time slot. In 2009 it was renamed Whizz Quiz and was not nature-based. (on Wednesday). *'MEE News', Eliot dresses up as Michael Eion Everyringtone and presents a news bulletin. (on Friday) *'NOW', Elliot presents the audience a poll, hypothetical situation or question on one day. Viewers vote on the show's website and the results are featured on the next day's episode. (Monday/Tuesday for polls, Tuesday/Wednesday for HPS, Wednesday/Thursday for questions) *'Replay Bits That we've played already', where viewers request segments previously aired to be replayed (on Thursday). *'Professor Slo and Doctor Mo', where Elliot and Ruben Meerman dress up as the segment's namesakes and show a science experiment in slo mo (on Thursday). *'Triple Triple Triplets', 'The Kransky Sisters', where music critics review an album or explain it (on Monday, sometimes) *'Jaxon's 5', a play on the Jackson 5, this features a food correspondent explain a meal's top five highlights (on Wednesday, sometimes). * Booked out, a book review performed by Geoff Hutchison's son Hugh (unknown day). *'Jade's Movies', a play when a movie correspondent explain a movie, past or present, and gives how many reviews out of 5 is the movie (on Monday, sometimes). *'T5', Elliot reads tongue-twisters (On Friday, sometimes). *'Talk To Me', Elliot tells a question from the viewers and answer it. *'Best of ABC3', Elliot to be Rollercoaster from the viewers and answer it from Rollercoaster in ABC3. See ABC3. *'Zimmer Twins', A series of mini-movies made by kids around the world on the Rollercoaster website. The series also aired on Teletoon. Other segments are used only once or rarely, as in Your Jokes, a division of Chatter, where viewers send in jokes. It is sometimes used as fill-ins for updated segments, such as when the Now technology was being \\"re- now-ified\\".  Website  \\"Rollercoaster\\" is also the name of the show's website, which was created a few years previous to the show itself and features the phrase 'Rhymes with toaster'. The website itself was advertised as 'Rollercoaster' on the current timeslot taken by the show for a couple of years before the show began. The website features articles on shows and games and other entertainment related to shows or the general youth genre. This site is also where polls, voting, feedback and other interactive content could be submitted.

A colourful classic \\"short snout\\" 1969 MB LO1112 colectivo at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart. Colectivo (English: collective bus) is the name given in Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Paraguay to a type of public transportation vehicle, especially those of Argentina's capital city, Buenos Aires. The name comes from veh√≠culos de transporte colectivo (\\"vehicles for collective transport\\"), reflecting their origin as shared taxis.The design evolution of the colectivo. Article with much information and many photographs, accessed 10 April 2010 When they first appeared in the 1920s, colectivos were small buses built out of smaller vehicle chassis (cars, vans, etc.) and, later, out of truck chassis (1950-1990, by Mercedes-Benz Argentina), not specifically designed for the transportation of people, and were decorated with unique hand-painted drawings (fileteado) that gave each unit a distinct flavor. They steadily evolved and grew larger, but kept their picturesque style until the 1990s, when the urban fleet was modernized with standard rear-engined bus units. During most of their history, tickets were sold by the driver, who would drive off as soon as all passengers had boarded, selling tickets while driving. History =1928-1950= 1934 Chevrolet truck chassis colectivo Taxi-bus, Chevrolet Double Phaeton, creation of the \\"l√≠neas\\" In the 1900s Argentina was the \\"Granary of the World\\", one of the largest world food producers and exporters, and a wealthy country. The streets of prosperous Buenos Aires (with 2 million inhabitants) soon filled with cars. Commercial relations with the United Kingdom (mainly trade in meat and grain), also brought a myriad of investors and enterprises in the early years of the century, including Latin America's first metro system, cars, trains, tramways, taxis and public buses. On 24 September 1928, the first taxi-bus ran through Buenos Aires. Later called \\"colectivo\\", it was based on an Argentine-manufactured longer-wheelbase Chevrolet Superior K-series Double Phaeton called \\"Especial Argentino\\". It provided public transportation throughout Buenos Aires on pre-defined itineraries and stops, charging a low price for each passenger. Chevrolet started manufacturing a truck chassis adaptable to passenger transport. By the 1930s the size of the colectivo had increased from five to up to a dozen seats, and the Chevrolet line had become widely used, with bodies made by local companies.www.auto-historia.com History of General Motors in Argentina - accessed 15 November 2008 This style was kept until the 1970s and 1980s, by which time the units had twenty seats plus cramped room for many standing passengers. During its heyday, drivers deliberately challenged the \\"real\\" public buses and electric tramways, parking near them at the busiest stations and driving close to them during the day to pick up their passengers. Soon people started to prefer these colectivos, which displaced the original buses and trams. With time the routes were formalized, and owners of colectivos joined together into lines that operated standard routes, distinguished by numbers displayed on the colectivos. Since several lines often traversed the same roads, companies began to adopt different colors to distinguish their units more clearly than by the number alone. Line 60, a particularly well- known line with a long route, had its beginnings in this era. =1950-1990= Classic Mercedes Benz LO 3500 colectivo turned motorhome Mercedes-Benz truck and buses After World War II and during the 1950s Argentine industry started to develop again, but the country's public transport system was inadequate for the new era: practically no modernization had taken place since the early years, and the suburban railway system was not sufficient to meet the rising demands of the population. Mercedes-Benz moved into the colectivo market: in 1951 the then Daimler-Benz AG set up in Argentina its first factories outside Germany:www.mercedes-benz.argentina/history accessed 9 May 2008 one in the town of San Mart√≠n, near Buenos Aires, and another in Gonz√°lez Cat√°n. Mercedes released updated local colectivo chassis, a modified L 3500 truck chassis ‚Äì LO 3500, OP 3500, LO 311, LO 312, LO 911 (the [O] stands for Omnibus) ‚Äì with a separately manufactured body fitted later by different coachbuilders. In less than a decade the output was 6,500 units a year. In 1963 Mercedes built the 10,000nd colectivo (model LO 312), and continued with other models, such as L 1112 (120 HP), LA 1112 (all-wheel traction) and the L 1114\\\\. The Mercedes-Benz colectivos had truck powerplants, a diesel engine with power transmitted to the rear axle by a five-speed constant-mesh gearbox. All the lines progressively adopted these units and, from 1950 to 1990, all colectivos were eventually Mercedes-Benz models. =1990s to the present= Omnibus. Blurring of the tradition of the colectivo In 1987 El Detalle, one of the bus body suppliers of Mercedes-Benz, started competing with its former chassis provider, investing in low price and modern urban buses, with cheaper Deutz engines. That same year model El Detalle OA-101 was launched. This model was rear-engined and had pneumatic suspension, providing smoother rides and more inside space. Mercedes-Benz responded the following year with the rear-engined OH-1314, but that was considered \\"the death of the Colectivo\\",www.busarg.com.ar certainly the end of an era. In 1989 the last truck-based colectivos, on the classic Mercedes-Benz chassis LO-1114, were assembled. Production had been discontinued the previous year. Modern colectivo model Metalpar Tronador OH1315L-sb Mercedes Benz During the 1990s some companies found it cheaper to switch to single-colored units, and a flurry of mergers and foldings changed the appearance of colectivos. Nowadays, only the three-digit numbering and some of the routes survive from the traditional \\"l√≠neas\\", fileteado is rarely seen, the filigranas were lost, and some of the classic big details, such as the panoramic mirrors close to the driver's head, disappeared. After 1995 automatic ticket machines made journeys safer, since drivers did not have to sell tickets and drive at the same time. In 2005 Mercedes-Benz units accounted for about half of the buses in the city of Buenos Aires and its surroundings, with units built in Buenos Aires (La Favorita, Eivar, Italbus, Bimet-Corwin, Galicia, CND, CEAP, Ugarte, etc.) and in Brazil (Marcopolo, CAIO and others). The other half were El Detalle units and others such as Scania, Volvo, Dimex, Zanello and very few Ferroni. Most older units have been retired from service in Buenos Aires, as they are considered too dangerous and noisy for use in the fast-paced city. They were disposed of, or sent to smaller cities all over the country. Colectivos are usually retired only when they are too damaged to be repaired; some of them have ‚Äúresuscitated‚Äù as fine motorhomes. Description of the colectivo The Mercedes units were more sophisticated than the original taxi- bus but the body kept its artistic touches, preserving the original style of the colectivo. This style was not influenced by the social class of the districts through which the colectivos journeyed. All the units of all the \\"l√≠neas\\" shared these characteristics until the 1990s: Latest generation colectivo =Multi-colored units= Decorators used many colorful combinations over the units' external body, helping identify each one of the l√≠neas. These eventually evolved into \\"corporate colors\\": when one company ran several lines, they painted buses on all lines in the same colors. Until the 1990s the fileteado, individual to each bus, was maintained. =Fileteados= Fileteado has been defined as: \\"art on wheels\\": full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical\\".www.martinianoarce.com The colectivos were where this art found its best canvas. Long, wide mirrors placed around the driver seat often had winding drawings and motifs that usually portrayed the driver's preferences in football, religion and tango. The outside of the units was also painted with fileteado details, flower motifs, national flags, and football team banners. It was also very common to see phrases written down in complex fonts, usually at the back. These phrases were often ingenious puns or rhymes and became part of Argentine folklore. A simple example of a very common phrase is: Lo mejor que hizo la vieja es el pibe que maneja (loosely \\"The best thing my mum did was this bus-driving kid\\"). =Other details= The units with a larger budget had more details added around the driver's seat. These usually came in the form of lights of exotic colors or seat covers with wool and fringes or even leather. It was very common to see the gear-stick full of hanging knickknacks and the casing where the tickets and coins were stored covered with motifs. Before 1995 tickets were sold by the colectivero (driver) as he drove; they were colored strips of paper with a 5-digit number. Palindromic numbers (such as 10301) were called capicuas (from Catalan cap i cua, \\"head and tail\\") and sometimes collected. Usage in Buenos Aires Colectivo line 194 in Buenos Aires The colectivo bus operations of Buenos Aires provide a widespread and frequent bus service that attracts exceptionally high ridership with virtually no public financial supportTransportation Research Board, Buenos Aires Colectivo Buses and Experience with Privatization accessed 5 May 2008 beyond subsidized petrol to keep fares low. With low ticket prices, very frequent services, and extensive routes, with many places within 400m of a route, the colectivo is a very widely used mode of transportation around the city. \\"Porte√±os\\" (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires' residents) have a love-hate relationship with the colectivo: on the one hand, they are usually very crowded in rush hour and plagued with pickpockets, petty thieves, beggars and hawkers (itinerant salesmen), though more controlled nowadays. On the other hand, they are a necessity in the city, and a convenient and cheap way to get around. Most colectivos in the big cities of Argentina do not have a fixed timetable, but run at least four, and often many more, services per hour, depending on the bus line and time of day. During night-time, all colectivos in Buenos Aires city run through their stops at least twice an hour. =Fares= Most buses share a basic distance-dependent fare system. the \\"universal\\" fare in pesos was: * ARS 9.00 (about USD 0.40) for one section * ARS 9.25 (about USD 0.42) for two sections (within Buenos Aires, CABA) * ARS 9.50 (about USD 0.44) for three sections or more (within Buenos Aires, CABA) * ARS 9.75 (about USD 0.46) for two sections (Greater Buenos Aires, GBA ) * ARS 10.00 (about USD 0.48) for three sections (Greater Buenos Aires, GBA) Section boundaries are fixed at about 3 km from each other (less so near the city center), so that a 4-kilometer ride may sometimes require to pay the second rate. Fares are valid for one bus ride, with no transfer facility. Some lines operate a number of \\"diferencial\\" (premium) buses, with no need to stand and with other amenities, for example curtains, at a higher price. In popular culture *The makers of the 1979 motion picture La fiesta de todos,www.cinenacional.com after Argentina's victory in the 1978 FIFA World Cup were forced by the military government to film one of its key stories inside a colectivo. *One of Argentina's best-remembered soap operas was called Un mundo de 20 asientos (\\"A 20-seat world\\") and its main character was a colectivero (colectivo driver). * Domestically, the colectivo is also called bondi; the word comes from the name of Rio de Janeiro's tramways (bondes), in turn from English bonds, which is how the government paid for the Rio tramway system to the British company that built it. *The term colectivo came to be used in some neighbouring countries including Paraguay.

Two ski lodges were destroyed and 18 people died. Stuart Diver was the only survivor. Landslide There were 18 deaths when the Bimbadeen and Carinya Lodges were destroyed at Thredbo Alpine Village at 11:35 pm on Wednesday, 30 July 1997. About of liquefied earth and debris came down the slope. As the unstable slope above the four-storey Carinya Lodge (owned by the Brindabella Ski Club) slipped downhill, it hit the east wing of the Carinya Ski Lodge, tearing it in two. This initial landslide removed the support for the Alpine Way road which in turn collapsed, shearing the western half of Carinya from its foundations, allowing it to slide downhill and crossing a road before colliding with the Bimbadeen Ski Lodge at high speed, destroying both. Bimbadeen Staff Lodge was then hit, and it, too, collapsed. Witnesses reported hearing \\"a whoosh of air, a crack and a sound like a freight train rushing down the hill\\". John Cameron, a member of Brindabella Ski Club, who was alone in Carinya, along with 17 residents in Bimbadeen, lost their lives when the lodges were destroyed. At 11:37 pm, New South Wales Fire Brigades Communication Centre at Wollongong received emergency calls from the lodge at Thredbo. The local fire brigades had responded to reports of a 'small explosion' in the village. The first report to come through said that 100 people had been trapped. Police arrived at 12:30 am and evacuated the area. A regional disaster was declared, with Goulburn established as the disaster coordination centre for the region, with Sydney also notified. Medical staff were sent from Cooma to Thredbo, and also from Canberra to Jindabyne, which was a point for triage. Four specialists were flown from St George Hospital in Sydney to Thredbo. By 2:30 am, there were 100 professional services on the scene, and many volunteers such as from the Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA) of New South Wales, the State Emergency Service (SES) of New South Wales and the Australian Red Cross. =Thursday, 31 July= SES volunteers (orange) and firemen (yellow) assist at the Thredbo debris slope, 1997 At 7:30 am, a forward medical command post was established, set up in a lodge located from the site of the disaster. Inspector Rory O'Driscoll of the NSW Police arrived at 8:15 am. At 10:00 am, geophysicists who had been flown to the area from Sydney declared that the site was safe enough to begin an excavation of the top layers, but was still very unstable with a now-exposed underground stream flowing through the debris at the rate of 6,120 litres per hour. At 10:30 am, a medical team inspected the disaster site. Many of the rescue workers themselves required treatment of minor injuries and the medical team realised they had to be prepared to treat exhaustion and hypothermia among the workers. The first body was recovered at 4:20 pm. At 6:30 pm, a second specialist medical team arrived from the Royal North Shore Hospital. The State Emergency Service rotated 1,350 rescue crew with about 250 on the site at any one time. The slope of the hillside, which ranged from 20 to 40 degrees and the sub-zero temperatures made rescue efforts difficult. By midnight, 24 hours after the landslide had occurred, just one body had been discovered. During the night, the temperature at Thredbo dropped to . =Friday, 1 August= On 1 August, one more body was discovered in the early morning, and two more later during the day. A large slab of concrete which had been part of the Bimbadeen carpark made rescue efforts difficult. At 3:00 pm, doctors met the relatives of the missing. During the day, several environmental issues were identified such as water and sewerage being cut off to the site, and some diesel fuel seeping into Thredbo Creek. Rescue workers announced on Friday that there was little hope in finding any survivors. They had not completely given up hope, but Assistant Police Commissioner Ken Moroney told reporters; \\"I think at this stage the chances are quite remote.\\" Stuart Diver At 5:37 am on 2 August, digging finished and rescue workers dropped sound equipment into a hole they had been digging, as was the standard procedure. This time, they detected some movement underneath the concrete slab. Five minutes later, rescue expert firefighter Steve Hirst, who used monitoring equipment to confirm the movement, yelled out \\"Rescue team working overhead, can anyone hear me?\\" to which a voice called back \\"I can hear you.\\" When asked if he had sustained any injuries, the voice replied \\"No, but my feet are bloody cold!\\" He was identified as ski instructor Stuart Diver. A pipe was then passed down the gap to provide warmer air which would increase his low body temperature. Another tube was put down which carried fluids from which he could have two sips every 20 minutes. Hirst explained to the press that Diver said he was uninjured, just extremely cold. Police Superintendent Charlie Sanderson explained to the press the difficulty of extracting Diver because they could not risk the concrete slab falling on top of him. His position was two metres below the surface, beneath three concrete slabs. He was lying in water, wearing only a pair of underpants. Due to the risk of the overlaying concrete crushing Diver, rescuers began digging a 16-metre-long tunnel from the eastern side of the slope. Five hours later, rescuers had removed enough of the rubble for them to be able to touch Diver. Paul Featherstone was the paramedic who kept talking to Diver for 11 hours until he was freed. When the site had to be evacuated each time the rubble shifted, Featherstone would stay below ground to keep Diver talking and distract him. Diver was pulled from the wreckage later in the evening. His first words were as he breathed the pure mountain air, \\"That sky's fantastic!\\" He had lain trapped for 65 hours in a small space between two concrete slabs beside the body of his first wife, Sally, who had died by drowning as a concrete beam had pinned her in a depression that had filled with water overnight. The rescue effort continued after Diver had been found, now that rescue workers had hope that there would be more survivors. They did not find any, and the last body was recovered on the following Thursday. Aftermath In 1998, three terraces with gabions and reinforced fill were constructed on the site and the Alpine Way was rebuilt with upslope retaining walls. The site along with a section of the Alpine Way is now monitored with 25 inclinometers, to detect any slope movement, and 12 piezometers, to keep track of water flow in the soil. Brindabella Ski Club opened its new lodge on 5 June 2004. The Coroner's report released on 29 June 2000 said that the landslide was caused by water from heavy rain, melting snow and a leaking water main. The landslide hit an eastern wing of one of the lodges first, which caused the nearby land to collapse onto lodges below. The State Government of New South Wales spent $40 million in out-of-court settlements with 91 businesses and individuals after the incident. On 3 December 2004, the Supreme Court judgment blamed the leaking water main pipe and the Alpine Way, which was built on a road full of debris, as the cause of the disaster. Soil creep had caused the main to fracture, which had saturated the already unstable slope that supported the road above Carinya. The Alpine Way had originally been built as a temporary construction access road by the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority during the 1950s to access the Murray-1 and Murray-2 hydroelectric power stations constructed as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Once the power stations were completed, the Authority upgraded the road with fill and planted vegetation on the downhill hillside before transferring ownership to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. No individual government authority had responsibility for maintenance while the National Parks and Wildlife Service's own funding was inadequate for maintenance of park roads \\"not designed for the purpose to which they were later put\\".

A breach in a dike during the North Sea flood of 1953. A levee breach or levee failure (the word dike or dyke can also be used instead of levee) is a situation where a levee fails or is intentionally breached, causing the previously contained water to flood the land behind the levee. Causes of failure Man-made levees can fail in a number of ways. The most frequent (and dangerous) form of levee failure is a breach. A levee breach is when part of the levee actually breaks away, leaving a large opening for water to flood the land protected by the levee. =Foundation failure= A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure that is caused either by surface erosion or by a subsurface failure of the levee. Levee breaches are often accompanied by levee boils, or sand boils. The underseepage resurfaces on the landside, in the form of a volcano-like cone of sand. Boils signal a condition of incipient instability which may lead to erosion of the levee toe or foundation or result in sinking of the levee into the liquefied foundation below. Some engineers think that boils lead to a form of internal erosion called piping which undermines the levee, but others consider them a symptom of generalized instability of the foundation. =Erosion and damage= Surface erosion of the surface of a levee is usually caused by the action of wind and water (waves but also normal flow). Erosion can be worsened by pre-existing or new damage to a levee. Areas with no surface protection are more prone to erosion. A levee grazed by certain types of animals, like sheep, can show trails used by the animals where grass does not grow. Trees in levees are a special risk. A tree can become unstable after the soil of the levee has become saturated with water. When the tree falls the root system will likely take a chunk of the saturated soil out of the levee. This shallow hole can quickly erode and result in a breach. If the tree falls in the water and floats away it can damage the levee further downstream. Floating trees near levees should be quickly removed by the agency responsible for the maintenance of the levee. Other forms of damage can be caused by ships or other (large) floating objects or from objects in the levee, like traffic signs or fences that are damaged or completely removed by wind or water. Barbed wire fences can collect large amounts of floating plant material, resulting in a large amount of drag from the water. Whole fences can be dragged away by the water. =Overtopping= Sometimes levees are said to fail when water overtops the crest of the levee. Levee overtopping can be caused when flood waters simply exceed the lowest crest of the levee system or if high winds begin to generate significant swells (a storm surge) in the ocean or river water to bring waves crashing over the levee. Overtopping can lead to significant landside erosion of the levee or even be the mechanism for complete breach. Often levees are armored or reinforced with rocks or concrete to prevent erosion and failure. kolk lake in the Netherlands Kolk lakes After a levee breach a kolk lake can often be seen. This is a crater-like depression just behind the breach where soil and other material has been violently scoured out by the rushing water. After a breach, a kolk lake can sometimes remain after the water level recedes. Intentional breaches In some cases levees are breached intentionally. This can be done to protect other areas, to drain flooded areas, or to give back land to nature. In most cases an intentional breach is not without discussion since valuable land is given up. During the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 a levee was blown up with dynamite to prevent the flooding of New Orleans. Again during record-breaking flooding in 2011, the US Army Corps of Engineers blew up a section of a Mississippi River levee with dynamite to open the New Madrid Floodway. The floodway was used for farming and had about 200 residents at the time. The levee at Bird's Point was designed to be removed if necessary so that Mississippi water levels would be lowered, taking pressure off levees for miles upstream in more populated areas such as Cairo, Illinois, and New Madrid, Missouri. Taking land from the cycle of flooding by putting a dike around it prevents it from being raised by silt left behind after a flood. At the same time the drained soil consolidates and peat decomposes leading to land subsidence. In this way the difference between the water level on one side and land level on the other side of the dike grows. In some areas reclaimed land is given back to nature by breaching and removing dikes to allow flooding to occur (again). This restores the natural environment in the area. This happened in the Glory River in Iraq. Examples of levee breaches =New Orleans= The words levee and levee breach were brought heavily into the public consciousness after the levee failures in metro New Orleans on August 29, 2005 when Hurricane Katrina passed east of the city. Levees breached in over 50 different places submerging 80 percent of the city. Most levees failed due to water overtopping them but some failed when water passed underneath the levee foundations causing the levee wall to shift and resulting in catastrophic sudden breaching. The sudden breaching released water at a high velocity that moved houses off their foundations and tossed cars into trees. This happened in the Lower Ninth Ward when the Industrial Canal breached and also in the Lakeview neighborhood when the 17th Street Canal breached. At least 1,464 people perished. In New Orleans, the United States Army Corps of Engineers is the Federal agency responsible for levee design and construction as defined in the Flood Control Act of 1965 and subject to local participation requirements, some of which were later waived. Fault has been aimed at the Corps of Engineers, their local contractors, and local levee boards. =North Sea= The St. Elizabeth's flood of 1421 was caused by a surge of seawater being forced upriver during a storm, overflowing the river dikes and submerging approximately of land in the Netherlands. Estimates of people having died range from 2,000 to 10,000. Parts of the submerged lands have still not been reclaimed resulting in the Biesbosch wetlands. During the North Sea flood of 1953, in the night of 31 January ‚Äì 1 February 1953, many dikes in the provinces of Zeeland, Zuid-Holland and Noord-Brabant in the Netherlands were unable to withstand the combination of spring tide and a northwesterly storm. The resulting flood killed 1,835 people. A further 307 people were killed by dike breaches in the United Kingdom, in the counties of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. In the Netherlands this flood was a main reason for the construction of the Delta Works, probably the most innovative and extensive levee system in the world.

She was related from her father's side to Turkish novelist Halid Ziya U≈üaklƒ±gil.  Biography  L√¢tife Hanƒ±m was born in 1898 in Smyrna (now known in English as ƒ∞zmir) to one of the most prominent trading families of the city, with roots in the city of U≈üak, whence their unofficial family name of U≈üakiz√¢de. She completed her high school studies in Smyrna and in 1919 she went abroad to study Law in Paris and London. When she came back to Turkey, the Turkish War of Independence was nearing its end. On 11 September 1922, upon returning to her family mansion in Smyrna, she was confronted by soldiers who notified her that the Pasha had taken the house as General Headquarters in Smyrna. After convincing the soldiers that she actually belonged to the household, she was allowed in. L√¢tife Hanƒ±m and Mustafa Kemal Pasha married on 29 January 1923 when he had returned to Smyrna just after his mother Z√ºbeyde Hanƒ±m's death. For two and a half years, L√¢tife Hanƒ±m symbolized the new face of Turkish women as a first lady who was very present in public life which, in Turkey, was a novelty by the standards of her day. She had a significant influence on the reforms which began in Turkey in the 1920s for the emancipation of women. Likely influenced by her husband's staunch secularism, she discarded her Islamic head covering and urged Turkish women to do the same. However, the relationship between her and her husband was cut short after the summer of 1925 and they divorced on 5 August 1925. L√¢tife Hanƒ±m lived the rest of her days in Izmir (as Smyrna came to be known in English after the 1930s) and ƒ∞stanbul (known as Constantinople in English prior to the 1930s), in virtual seclusion, avoiding contacts outside her private circle until her death in 1975. She never remarried, and remained silent about their relationship throughout her life. In 2005, the Turkish Historical Society was to make her diaries public \\"except for the most private ones, taking the views of her family into consideration\\". However, her family publicly claimed that they had the right to the ownership of the letters and stated that they did not wish the diaries to be published. Consequently, the society decided against the publication. A comprehensive but also controversial biography of Latife Hanƒ±m by the veteran Cumhuriyet journalist ƒ∞pek √áalƒ±≈ülar was published in 2006.

The detection limit is estimated from the mean of the blank, the standard deviation of the blank, the slope (analytical sensitivity) of the calibration plot and a defined confidence factor (e.g. 3.2 being the most accepted value for this arbitrary value). Another consideration that affects the detection limit is the accuracy of the model used to predict concentration from the raw analytical signal. As a typical example, from a calibration plot following a model equation \\"f(x) = a + b(x)\\" where \\"f(x)\\" corresponds to the signal measured (e.g. voltage, luminescence, energy, etc.), \\"a\\" the value in which the equation cuts the ordinates axis, \\"b\\" the sensitivity of the system (the slope of the plot or the function interacting with the measurable variable) and \\"x\\" the value which is measured (e.g. temperature, concentration, pH, etc.), the LOD is calculated as the \\"x\\" value in which f(x) equals to the average value of blanks \\"y\\" plus \\"t\\" times its standard deviation \\"s\\" (or, if zero, the standard deviation corresponding to the lowest value measured) where \\"t\\" is the chosen confidence value (e.g. for a confidence of 95% it can be considered t = 3.2, determined from the limit of blank). Thus, LOD = (f(x)-a)/b = (y + 3.2s - a)/b. There are a number of concepts derived from the detection limit that are commonly used. These include the instrument detection limit (IDL), the method detection limit (MDL), the practical quantitation limit (PQL), and the limit of quantitation (LOQ). Even when the same terminology is used, there can be differences in the LOD according to nuances of what definition is used and what type of noise contributes to the measurement and calibration. The figure below illustrates the relationship between the blank, the limit of detection (LOD), and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) by showing the probability density function for normally distributed measurements at the blank, at the LOD defined as 3 * standard deviation of the blank, and at the LOQ defined as 10 * standard deviation of the blank. For a signal at the LOD, the alpha error (probability of false positive) is small (1%). However, the beta error (probability of a false negative) is 50% for a sample that has a concentration at the LOD (red line). This means a sample could contain an impurity at the LOD, but there is a 50% chance that a measurement would give a result less than the LOD. At the LOQ (blue line), there is minimal chance of a false negative. Instrument detection limit Most analytical instruments produce a signal even when a blank (matrix without analyte) is analyzed. This signal is referred to as the noise level. The IDL is the analyte concentration that is required to produce a signal greater than three times the standard deviation of the noise level. This may be practically measured by analyzing 8 or more standards at the estimated IDL then calculating the standard deviation from the measured concentrations of those standards. The detection limit (according to IUPAC) is the smallest concentration or absolute amount of analyte that has a signal significantly larger than the signal arising from a reagent blank. Mathematically, the analyte‚Äôs signal at the detection limit (Sdl) is given by: S_{dl} = S_{reag} + 3\\\\sigma_{reag} . where Sreag is the signal for a reagent blank, \\\\sigma_{reag} is the known standard deviation for the reagent blank‚Äôs signal. Other approaches for defining the detection limit have also been developed. In atomic absorption spectrometry usually the detection limit is determined for a certain element by analyzing a diluted solution of this element and recording the corresponding absorbances. The experiment is repeated for 10 times. The 3œÉ of the recorded absorbance signal can be considered as the detection limit for the specific element under the experimental conditions used ‚Äì wavelength, type of flame, instrument. Method detection limit Oftentimes there is more to the analytical method than just performing a reaction or submitting it to direct analysis. For example, it might be necessary to heat a sample that is to be analyzed for a particular metal with the addition of acid first (this is called digestion). The sample may also be diluted or concentrated prior to analysis on an instrument. Additional steps in an analysis add additional opportunities for error. Since detection limits are defined in terms of error, this will naturally increase the measured detection limit. This detection limit (with all steps of the analysis included) is called the MDL. The practical method for determining the MDL is to analyze 7 samples of concentration near the expected limit of detection. The standard deviation is then determined. The one-sided t-distribution is determined and multiplied versus the determined standard deviation. For seven samples (with six degrees of freedom) the t value for a 99% confidence level is 3.14. Rather than performing the complete analysis of seven identical samples, if the Instrument Detection Limit is known, the MDL may be estimated by multiplying the Instrument Detection Limit or Lower Level of Detection by the dilution prior to analyzing the sample solution on the instrument. This estimation, however, ignores any uncertainty that arises from performing the sample preparation and will therefore probably underestimate the true MDL. Limit of Quantitation The LOQ is the limit at which the difference between two distinct values can be reasonably discerned. The LOQ may be drastically different between laboratories so another detection limit is commonly used that is referred to as the Practical Quantitation Limit (PQL).

The bureau also managed shipyards, repair facilities, laboratories, and shore stations. On 20 June 1940, Congress passed a law which consolidated the Bureau's functions with those of the Bureau of Engineering (BuEng), creating the Bureau of Ships (BuShips).  History  The Bureau was staffed by officers of the Construction Corps (called constructors) with advanced degrees in naval architecture. Six civilian constructors were hired by the Navy in 1794 to supervise construction of the frigates authorized by Congress that year.Snyder, Philip W., RADM USN \\"Bring Back the Corps\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings February 1979 p.49 The Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repairs was established in 1842 as one of the five original material bureaus replacing the former Board of Navy Commissioners. In 1862, Congress decided to replace the Bureau into three new organizations: the Bureau of Construction and Repair, the Bureau of Steam Engineering (later called the Bureau of Engineering), and the Bureau of Equipment. The Bureau of Construction and Repair was established by Congress by an act of July 5, 1862 (12 Stat. 510). The new organization, headed by a Chief of the Bureau, was responsible for all aspects of ship construction, except for propulsion systems, which were the responsibility of the Bureau of Engineering; and equipage, which fell under the Bureau of Equipment. The Construction Corps was created in 1866 to be staffed by constructors graduated from the United States Naval Academy cadet-engineer curriculum implemented in 1864.Snyder, Philip W., RADM USN \\"Bring Back the Corps\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings February 1979 pp.50-51 The Construction Corps provided permanent naval status for personnel who had formerly been employed in a civilian capacity on an as-needed basis.Snyder, Philip W., RADM USN \\"Bring Back the Corps\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings February 1979 p.51 Naval constructors gained the rank and recognition previously available to doctors of the Medical Corps and pursers of the Supply Corps. Two cadet- engineers of the Naval Academy class of 1879, Frances Bowles and Richard Gatewood, set the standard for postgraduate education of Construction Corps officers. Bowles and Gatewood completed postgraduate work in England in the developing science of naval architecture. The postgraduate program shifted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1901. The Bureau of Equipment was discontinued in 1910, and formally abolished in 1914. Its functions were divided between the Bureau of Construction and Repair and the Bureau of Steam Engineering. These two bureaus were placed under the supervision of the Coordinator of Shipbuilding in 1939, and were superseded by the Bureau of Ships in 1940. The \\"engineering duty only\\" (EDO) designation of Bureau of Engineering officers expanded to include naval architects of the Construction Corps when the Bureau of Ships was formed in 1940. The consolidation with BuEng into BuShips had its origins when , first of the s to be delivered, was found to be heavier than designed and dangerously top-heavy in early 1939. It was determined that an underestimate by BuEng of the weight of a new machinery design was responsible, and that BuC&R; did not have sufficient authority to detect or correct the error during the design process. Initially, Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison proposed consolidation of the design divisions of the two bureaus. When the bureau chiefs could not agree on how to do this, he replaced both chiefs in September 1939. The consolidation was finally effected by a law passed by Congress on 20 June 1940. = Chiefs of the Bureau = Individuals who served as Chief of the Bureau include: * Commodore David Conner, September 1, 1842 - March 1, 1843 * Captain Beverly Kennon, March 2, 1843 - April 9, 1844 * Commodore Charles Morris, April 10, 1844 - May 31, 1847 * Commodore Charles W.

Hand affected by Ulnar deviation Ulnar deviation, also known as ulnar drift, is a hand deformity in which the swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints (the big knuckles at the base of the fingers) causes the fingers to become displaced, tending towards the little finger. Its name comes from the displacement toward the ulna (as opposed to radial deviation, in which fingers are displaced toward the radius). Ulnar deviation is likely to be a characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, more than of osteoarthritis. Consideration should also be given to pigmented villonodular synovitis, in the setting of ulnar deviation and metacarpophalangeal synovitis. Ulnar deviation is also a physiological movement of the wrist, where the hand including the fingers move towards the ulna.

Variations One kind, which may be called a quadrilateral book, consists of p quadrilaterals sharing a common edge (known as the \\"spine\\" or \\"base\\" of the book). That is, it is a Cartesian product of a star and a single edge. The 7-page book graph of this type provides an example of a graph with no harmonious labeling. A second type, which might be called a triangular book, is the complete tripartite graph K1,1,p. It is a graph consisting of p triangles sharing a common edge. A book of this type is a split graph. This graph has also been called a K_e(2,p). Triangular books form one of the key building blocks of line perfect graphs.. The term \\"book-graph\\" has been employed for other uses. Barioli used it to mean a graph composed of a number of arbitrary subgraphs having two vertices in common. (Barioli did not write B_p for his book-graph.)

It is a popular holiday destination year round, especially in winter. This is due to its proximity to major ski resort developments within the Kosciuszko National Park, including Thredbo, Perisher and Charlotte Pass. Originally situated on land that is now under Lake Jindabyne, the township was transferred to its present location in the 1960s due to the construction of Jindabyne Dam, on the Snowy River, as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. At the , Jindabyne had a population of 2,629 people. The town's name is derived from an aboriginal word meaning \\"valley\\". Jindabyne is one of the highest settlements of its size in Australia, at 918 metres above sea level. Light snowfalls sometimes occur during winter. In mid-July in 2004 and 2005, snow fell up to half a metre following freak snowfalls over a large area of New South Wales. Jindabyne is connected to the surrounding area by Kosciuszko Road & North via Canberra, the Alpine Way West to the Riverina and Wodonga and the Barry Way to the South and Gippsland. History Originally situated on a site that is now under the waters of Lake Jindabyne, the township was relocated to its present position in the 1960s before the damming of the Snowy River as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The Scheme was developed from the 1940s as a way of increasing the flow of inland rivers in order to encourage the development of primary industries based on irrigation, and to create hydroelectricity. Completed in 1967, Jindabyne Dam is a major dam, located approximately south south-east of the relocated township. Parts of Old Jindabyne can be seen when the levels of Lake Jindabyne are low particularly the foundations of the old St Columbkille Roman Catholic Church. The settlement of East Jindabyne is located above what was Old Jindabyne. The dam's main purpose is for the generation of hydropower and is one of the sixteen major dams that comprise the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a vast hydroelectricity and irrigation complex constructed in south-east Australia between 1949 and 1974 and now run by Snowy Hydro. Jindabyne celebrated the new town's 50th anniversary on 19 December 2014 with a long lunch, parade through the town centre, and speech by Peter Hendy MP. The celebrations were attended by His Excellency, General David Hurley, Governor of New South Wales, Member for Monaro, Mr John Barilaro, Mayor of Snowy Mountains Shire, Mr John Cahill. Skiing and tourism Jindabyne is a service town for Australia's highest ski resorts: Perisher, Thredbo and Charlotte Pass. Thredbo and Perisher are approximately 30 minutes' drive into the Kosciuszko National Park, although require the payment of park entry fees (AU$29 per vehicle per dayNSW National Parks and Wildlife Service: Kosciuszko National Park) and the compulsory carrying of snow chains in winter for cars without 4WD. However, Jindabyne also attracts tourists in summer with Lake Jindabyne popular for activities such as fishing, water skiing and wakeboarding. Since the late 2000s mountain biking has become a popular summer activity and as of 2016, is assisting in turning the Snowy Mountains into a year-round adventure-tourist destination. The town is heavily tourist-oriented with a large range of snow-sport rental outlets and accommodation facilities. Prices can be heavily increased during the peak winter season, although they generally remain lower than those of outlets within the national park and ski resorts. Lake Jindabyne is a sailing, walking and fishing destination. The body of water is one of the largest fresh water reservoirs in New South Wales, and has a resident population of Atlantic Salmon, Brook Trout Brown trout and Rainbow Trout. Lake Jindabyne also has a reputation as one of the best places to catch trout in Australia. The Gaden Trout Hatchery, located about 10 kilometres north-west of Jindabyne, on the route leading to Perisher Ski Resort, holds tours of the hatchery's trout ponds, and is one of Australia's main centres involved in the breeding and rearing of cold water sport fish. Access to information regarding current tourist activities, business listings can be found using the area's free mobile app, the \\"Jindy Guide\\". Every year during the Easter holidays, the Lake Light Sculpture exhibition is hosted on Lake Jindabyne. The Lake has many sculptures on display including the Count Paul Strzelecki in the Banjo Paterson Park and an Irish harp. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 2,629 people in Jindabyne. 76.2% of people were born in Australia and 83.7% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 39.6%, Catholic 20.3% and Anglican 14.4%. Climate Jindabyne has a cool oceanic climate (Cfb) with some continental influence. Diurnal range is high, especially in the summer. Rainfall is moderate and is evenly distributed throughout the year, with a slight peak in spring. Snowfalls are common in the region, but usually light (although sometimes heavy). Owing to its position on the leeward side of the ranges, Jindabyne receives foehn winds which swiftly melt snow after a westerly frontal system has passed through.  Education  Aerial view from east Wild brumby horses, in snow near Jindabyne.

() is a 1953 Spanish comedy film directed by Luis Garc√≠a Berlanga, and considered one of the masterpieces of Spanish cinema. The film highlights the stereotypes held by both the Spanish and the Americans regarding the culture of the other, as well as displays social criticism of 1950s Francoist Spain (showing a typical Spanish village, with typical inhabitants: a priest, the majority of the population that are peasants, the mayor, and a hidalgo). The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Plot A small Castilian town, Villar del R√≠o is alerted to an upcoming visit of American diplomats; the town begins preparations to impress the American visitors, in the hopes of benefiting under the Marshall Plan. Hoping to demonstrate the side of Spanish culture with which the visiting American officials will be most accustomed, the citizens don unfamiliar Andalusian costumes, hire a renowned flamenco performer, and re-decorate their town in Andalusian style. A flamenco impresario (Manolo Mor√°n) who spent time in Boston advises the locals to think of what they will ask from the Americans. On the eve of the Americans' visit, three of the central characters dream of stereotypical American culture and history, based uniquely on their lives and experiences. The mayor dreams of a Western-like bar brawl, the hidalgo dreams of the arrival of a conquistador on New World shores, and the priest sees the hoods of a Holy Week procession turn into Klansmen dragging him before the Committee on Un-American Activities accompanied by jazz music. Also, a poorer man dreams that the Americans, shown as the Three Kings, fly over his field and parachute a new tractor into his field. The day of the Americans' visit arrives - and the whole town is prepared to put on a show. However, the American motorcade speeds through the village without stopping. The locals are left to remove the decorations and pay for the expenses with their personal belongings - including the flamenco impresario, who gives up a gold ring given to him by the Americans in Boston. Production Initially, it was intended as a comic vehicle for the flamenco singer Lolita Sevilla, but Berlanga decided to give it a deeper meaning.

He has, however, expressed reservations about some of Cameron's policies, including his proposal for a British \\"Bill of Rights\\", about which Bogdanor said, \\"I believe it's ill thought-out and confused.... He [Cameron] may have forgotten some of the things I've taught him. I'd be happy to give him a few more tutorials on civil liberties.\\" = Damian Green = Bogdanor referred to the arrest, search and questioning of the Conservative MP Damian Green, for aiding and abetting misconduct in public office by police from Special Branch, as \\"a storm in a teacup\\". \\"The important principle is that MPs ‚Äì apart from when they're speaking in the chamber and dealing with constituents' correspondence ‚Äì are subject to the same laws as the rest of us.\\" Awards and honours Bogdanor was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1998 Birthday Honours for services to constitutional history. In 2009, he was appointed a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur by the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, for his work on the law and history of Britain and France; the honour was presented to Bogdanor by the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maurice Gourdault-Montagne. Personal life Bogdanor married Judith Evelyn Beckett in 1972; the marriage was dissolved in 2000.

Stamped concrete is commonly used for patios, sidewalks, driveways, pool decks, and interior flooring. The ability of stamped concrete to resemble other building materials makes stamped concrete a less expensive alternative to using those other authentic materials such as stone, slate or brick. There are three procedures used in stamped concrete which separate it from other concrete procedures; the addition of a base color, the addition of an accent color, and stamping a pattern into the concrete. These three procedures provide stamped concrete with a color and shape similar to the natural building material. It also is longer-lasting than paved stone, and still resembles the look. Procedures =Adding base color= The base color is the primary color used in stamped concrete. The base color is chosen to reflect the color of the natural building material. The base color is produced by adding a color hardener to the concrete. Color hardener is a powder pigment used to dye the concrete. The color hardener can be applied using one of two procedures; integral color or cast-on color. Integral color is the procedure where the entire volume of concrete is dyed the base color. The entire volume of concrete is colored by adding the color hardener to the concrete truck, and allowing all the concrete in the truck to be dyed. Cast-on color is the procedure where the surface of the concrete is dyed the base color. The surface of the concrete is colored by spreading the color hardener onto the surface of the wet concrete and floating the powder into the top layer of the wet concrete. Concrete can be colored in many ways; color hardener, integral liquid or powder, acid stains to name a few. The process of integrally coloring the concrete offers the advantage of the entire volume being colored; however, the surface strength is not increased as with the use of color hardener. Dry shake color hardener is another popular way to color concrete. You broadcast the hardener on the concrete as soon as it is floated for the first time. After letting the bleed water soak into the hardener you float and trowel it in. This method only covers the surface about 3/16 of an inch but it gives the concrete surface a longer wear life. =Adding accent color= The accent color is the secondary color used in stamped concrete. The secondary color is used to produce texture and show additional building materials (e.g. grout) in the stamped concrete. The accent color is produced by applying color release to the concrete. Color release has two purposes - 1) It is a pigment used to color the concrete and 2) It is a non-adhesive used to prevent the concrete stamps from sticking to the concrete. The color release can be applied in one of two procedures based on the two forms it is manufactured in: powdered (cast-on color release made up of calcium-releasing powders that repel water); or liquid - which is a light aromatic-based solvent, spray-on color release. Cast-on color release is a procedure where the powder color release is applied by spreading the color release on the surface of the concrete before the concrete is stamped. Spray- on color release is a procedure where liquid color release is sprayed on the bottom of the concrete stamps before the concrete is stamped. =Stamping patterns= Concrete being stamped with an Ashlar Slate pattern The pattern is the shape of the surface of the stamped concrete. The pattern reflects the shape of the natural building material. The pattern is made by imprinting the concrete shortly after it has been poured with a \\"concrete stamp\\". Most modern concrete stamps are made of polyurethane, but older \\"cookie cutter\\" style stamps were made of various metals. The old style stamps lacked the capabilities of forming natural stone texture. Concrete stamping is the procedure which uses the concrete stamps to make the pattern in the stamped concrete. Concrete stamps are placed on the concrete after the color release has been applied. The concrete stamps are pushed into the concrete and then removed to leave the pattern in the stamped concrete. In most cases concrete stamping is made to look like ordinary building products such as flagstone, brick, natural stone, etc. History Stamping concrete increased in popularity in the 1970s when it was first introduced in the World of Concrete. Builders saw it as a new way to satisfy the customer and make their budget work simultaneously. This technique of stamping concrete has been done since at least the 1950s. When stamping concrete first began, there were very few choices of design and colors. However, as the industry grew more stamping patterns were being created along with many different types of stains. Another advantage to using stamped concrete is that it can be applied to many different surfaces and textures, such as driveways, highways, patios, decks, and even floors inside the home.

As its counterparts, the British and the US new wave, from which the main influences came, the Yugoslav scene was also closely related to punk rock, ska, reggae, 2 Tone, power pop and mod revival. Some of its acts are also counted as belonging to the Yugoslav punk scene which already existed prior to new wave. Such artists were labeled as both punk rock and new wave (the term \\"new wave\\" was initially interchangeable with \\"punk\\").  Overview  The Non-Aligned socialist Yugoslavia was never part of the Eastern Bloc and it was open to western influences (the West to some extent even supported Yugoslavia as a \\"buffer zone\\" to the Warsaw Pact). The new wave scene in Yugoslavia emerged in the late 1970s and had a significant impact on the Yugoslav culture. The Yugoslav rock scene in general, including the freshly arrived new wave music, was socially accepted, well developed and covered in the media. New wave was especially advocated by the magazines Polet from Zagreb and D≈æuboks from Belgrade, as well as the TV show Rokenroler, which was famous for its artistic music videos. This anti-establishment movement was even supported, although moderately, by the Communist authorities, particularly by the Communist youth organisation which often organized concerts, festivals, parties, exhibitions, and other cultural events. The lyrics that were criticizing and satirizing the flaws of the Yugoslav socialism were considered by the authorities as a \\"useful and friendly critique\\" and were often tolerated with certain cases of censorship. Especially the Zagreb-based band Azra, which is known for its political and social criticism in their songs. The Yugoslav new wave scene also cooperated with various conceptual or artistic movements related to pop art, avant-garde etc. Important artists of Yugoslav new wave were: Azra, ≈†arlo Akrobata, Idoli (famous for their song \\"Maljƒçiki\\" and its respective video in which they ridiculed the soviet soc-realism), Pankrti (first Yugoslav punk band), Prljavo kazali≈°te (started as a punk unit; the title of their second album Crno-bijeli svijet which means \\"black and white world\\" holds a reference to the 2 Tone movement), Elektriƒçni Orgazam (punk at the beginning, they moved towards post-punk and psychedelia later and were described as \\"The Punk Doors\\"), Slaƒëana Milo≈°eviƒá, Haustor (mostly reggae, ska and similar influences, but with a more poetic and intellectual approach compared to some danceable bands), Buldo≈æer, Laboratorija Zvuka, Film (one of the first Yugoslav new wave groups), Laƒçni Franz and many others. Some of them genuinely started as new wave bands, while others previously adhered other styles (for example the members of Azra were previously into a somewhat hippie style prior to becoming a new wave band). With the decreasing popularity of 1970s hard rock and progressive rock among the youths after the expansion of punk and new wave, even the cult rock band Bijelo Dugme decided to change its rural folkish hard rock style and jump onto the new wave bandwagon. They adopted the 2 Tone style for a short period of time while it was fashionable on their album Do≈æivjeti stotu which featured the ska theme \\"Ha, ha, ha\\". The refrain lyrics were used as a title for the compilation album Svi mar≈° na ples!. Cult symbols of the Yugoslav new wave era are the compilation albums Paket aran≈æman, Novi Punk Val, Artistiƒçka radna akcija and especially the movie Deƒçko koji obeƒáava.  Decline  As new wave perished into the mid-1980s, some of the bands split or took different musical directions. The period around 1982 is considered especially crucial concerning the decline of new wave in Yugoslavia. There were several other reasons why Yugoslav new wave started to fade beside the notable general decline of new wave around the world: the economical crisis in Yugoslavia in the first half of the 1980s and the political instability, especially in the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo in 1981 after Josip Broz Tito's death. Also, the musical genres such as post-punk, dark wave and gothic rock, as well as New Romantic and synthpop already saw a great expansion around the world, including Yugoslavia too. ≈†arlo Akrobata changed from its initial ska and reggae-inspired period, embracing a deeper post-punk sound. They were also a support act of Gang of Four in Zagreb, before they finally split in 1981. Milan Mladenoviƒá, its notable vocalist and guitarist in 1982 formed the cult band Ekatarina Velika which was noted for its dark poetic post-punk style and intellectual attitude. In the same year, his bandmate Du≈°an Kojiƒá \\"Koja\\" formed the group Disciplina kiƒçme, a band influenced by a variety of music styles, which later rose to international prominence. Idoli, Prljavo kazali≈°te and Film (the latter under the moniker Jura Stubliƒá i Film) later became pop or pop rock and all of them respectively achieved great mainstream success. During the 1980s Azra gradually moved to more conventional rock with occasional use of folk rock elements. Johnny ≈†tuliƒá's poetic trademarks were still notable throughout their lyrics; Elektriƒçni Orgazam soon became a successful mainstream rock band inspired mostly by the 1960s including artists such as the Rolling Stones. Legacy The Yugoslav new wave period is still considered the \\"Golden Age\\" of pop and rock music in the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav new wave scene gave birth to some of the most important Yugoslav acts ever and it was acclaimed by the Western media (notably by Melody Maker) for its quality and originality as well. In 2004 Igor Mirkoviƒá made a film titled Sretno dijete (\\"Happy Child\\") named after a song by Prljavo kazali≈°te. The movie covers the events in the former Yugoslav new wave scene.

Soomaa (\\"land of bogs\\") protects 390 km¬≤, the park was created in 1993. Soomaa Rahvuspark in Estonia Protected Planet Soomaa is Important Bird Area since 1989 and a Ramsar site of protected wetlands since 1997 and a Natura 2000 area since 2004. Geography The national park, situated in Vahe-Eesti (aka Meso- Estonia), was created in 1993 to protect large raised bogs, flood plain grasslands, paludified forests, and meandering rivers. The territory of the national park is mostly covered with large mires, separated from each other by the rivers of the P√§rnu River basin ‚Äî the Navesti, Halliste, Raudna and Lemmj√µgi rivers. Of the raised bogs, the most noteworthy is the Kuresoo Bog, whose steep southern slope, falling into Lemmej√µgi, rises by 8 metres over a distance of 100 m. On the eastern margin of the national park, lie the highest dunes on the Estonian mainland, situated some 50 kilometres off the contemporary coastline. The most characteristic coastal formations of the predecessor of the present Baltic Sea, the Baltic Ice Lake (11,200‚Äì10,600 years ago), which marks the one-time water level, are situated on the north- western and western edges of the Sakala Upland. The Ruunaraipe Dunes are the highest of the area. The dune ridge, winding from northwest to southeast is a 1.2 km-long sand ridge, whose maximum height is 12 metres. In 2009, the Soomaa National Park, as the largest intact peat bog system in Europe preserved as wilderness, joined the PAN Parks network of wilderness areas, as it proved excellence in combining wilderness protection and sustainable tourism development.  Floods  Seasonally flooded farmstead. When vast amounts of water run down the Sakala Upland, the rivers of Soomaa cannot contain it all. The water flows over flood plain grasslands and forests, and covers roads, disrupting connection with the outer world. In some years the spring floods have risen by a meter a day for 3‚Äì4 days. The Riisa flood area is formed in such a way; with a surface area covering 175 square kilometres at its largest, it is the biggest regularly flooded area in Estonia and whole Northern Europe. At the maximum flood level the water-covered area can be 7‚Äì8 km across. Steep- sloped, raised bogs stand as islands in the water. The flood is often called the \\"fifth season\\" in Soomaa. Flora and fauna  √ñrdi bog. Riisa bog. √ñrdi lake. Soomaa National Park is the most valuable part of the remaining extensive wilderness area in South-West Estonia. Kuresoo Bog is one of the two best surviving large bogs in Estonia with species diversity amongst the highest. ;Flora The alluvial meadows and forests that cover the riverbanks are of great botanical value. Approximately 200 species have been recorded, including Gladiolus imbricatus, iris sibirica, and Sedum telephium. The unique swamp forests (carrs) surrounding the site are also of special interest. ;Fauna The site regularly supports more than 1% of the individuals in relevant populations of Bewick's swan and common crane, and the composition of bird species in these bogs, especially Kuresoo, is one of the most representative in Estonia. Species recorded include golden eagle, Eurasian whimbrel (more than 100 pairs), European golden plover (ca. 150 pairs), dunlin (ssp. schinzii), merlin, willow ptarmigan, and Montagu's harrier. During the autumn migration, it is a stopover and roosting site for common cranes (ca. 1,000) and Bewick's swan (ca. 500), and during spring migration there are around 2,000 Bewick's swans. Corncrakes are still numerous on floodplain meadows (50-100 pairs). It is an important spawning ground for the northern pike. As a large wilderness area, Soomaa is a home and breeding area for several mammals that are extinct or very rare in other parts of Europe. The most numerous large mammal species are the roe deer, elk, and wild boar. Eurasian beaver, Eurasian lynx, grey wolf, brown bear, are also commonly found. ;Research Soomaa National Park and its surroundings are one of the main research areas for large carnivores and herbivores in Estonia. Starting from 2004 several cooperation projects have been organised between State Nature Conservation Centre and universities in Estonia and abroad. The main goal within these studies has been telemetric observation of species like Eurasian lynx and grey wolf. \\"In 2009 Soomaa receives PAN Parks certification\\" for its excellence in combining wilderness protection and sustainable tourism development.http://www.panparks.org/  Traditional culture  In last 70 years, Soomaa National Park area has faced dramatic changes due to the economic and political situation in the 20th century from what human habitation has decreased more than 10 times (87 people according to local municipalities in 2011). With a loss of human inhabitants, lot of tangible and intangible cultural heritage has been lost as well. To preserve as much of what is left or has been gathered to museums throughout the years a web page http://maastikud.ee/ was created in 2007. Project carried out by local NGOs http://mardu.ee/ and Estonian Literary Museum has brought back several toponyms crucial for the area to reveal its past. Such toponyms play a vital role in modern conservation. Knowledge of traditional landscape usage, read out from these names, can give us a better understanding also on the changes in regions ecology. Due to its remote location, Soomaa is probably the only place in Europe where the tradition of making dugout canoes (Estonian haabjas) survived into the 20th and 21st centuries. In recent decades, a new surge of interest in making dugouts has revitalized the ancient tradition.Haabjas - Estonian Dugout Canoe. Retrieved 5-2-2011. To support Soomaa National Park and its administration, http://keskkonnaamet.ee several NGOs have taken action in different fields: * Estonian Fund For Nature is one of the initiators on creating of Soomaa NP. Organiser of different monitoring works and conservation holidays today http://talgud.ee. * Estonian Fund For Nature is one of the oldest NGOs in the region, dealing mostly with different conservation issues and people living in Tipu village. * Tipu Nature School is responsible for nature educational programs * Mardu Studio is trying to bring back life to one of the few farms left in Soomaa area. Studying local intangible heritage and building an open studio for artists and designers  Recreation and tourism =Visitor Centre= The Soomaa National Park Visitor Centre is situated in South-West Estonia between P√§rnu and Viljandi county, being located in the middle of the park 44 km away from the centre of Viljandi and P√§rnu cities. Building of the visitor centre was finished in 1998 and has been placed on the historical crossroad of ancient winter ways that were used up to the beginning of 20th century for transporting goods from P√§rnu to Viljandi. The aim of the Visitor Centre is to give all information needed for those tourists, who come to explore the nature of Soomaa.

Building a dugout canoe. Canoeing season lasts from April until October. Canoeing is also one of the best ways to get acquainted with Soomaa. Canoeing on the flooded area is an adventurous experience, floods are common in the end of March or at the beginning of April. Guided trip on a traditional dugout canoes is an exclusive way of paddling, log-boat building camps are organised in summer. Bog walks can be undertaken in the area, walkways on wooden boards give visitors the opportunity to observe the special flora and fauna of the deep peat bogs. In winter, when the whole wetland is frozen, snowshoe and sledge tours are being organised over the frozen bogs and in the case of snow also cross-country skiing trips. In the year 2009 Soomaa National Park was awarded by European Commission as a supreme nature holiday destination.

It is best remembered for its horror films, particularly Witchfinder General (directed by Michael Reeves, 1968) and The Blood on Satan's Claw (directed by Piers Haggard, 1971). Other Tigon films include The Creeping Flesh, The Sorcerers and Doomwatch (1972), based on the TV series of the same name. A 1990s book by Andy Boot (Fragments of Fear) highlighted the importance of Tigon and Tony Tenser to the British horror genre but contained a number of factual errors, including the misidentification of a number of films as Tigon productions. This misidentification continues to this day. History Tigon was based at Hammer House in Wardour Street, London, and released a wide range of films from sexploitation (Zeta One), to an acclaimed television adaptation of August Strindberg's Miss Julie (1972) starring Helen Mirren. The largest part of its output, however, was made up by low-budget horror films in direct competition for audiences with Hammer Film Productions and Amicus Productions. In February 2005, a DVD box set of Tigon films was released by Anchor BayUK. The box set contains only Witchfinder General, The Body Stealers, The Haunted House of Horror, The Blood on Satan's Claw, The Beast in the Cellar, and Virgin Witch, and consists of UK rather than US prints, in Region 2 ‚Äì PAL format. Providing an audio commentary on a number of the films, as well as writing the productions notes, was the author and film critic John Hamilton. The same year, FAB press in the UK published John Hamilton's biography of Tony Tenser, a comprehensive look at the career of Tigon's founder and the man dubbed \\"the Godfather of British Exploitation\\". Hamilton had access to production files, diaries and personal correspondence, as well as recording a number of exclusive interviews with the likes of Vernon Sewell, Michael Armstrong, Christopher Lee, Ian Ogilvy and Peter Sasdy. He also recorded over 18 hours of interviews with Tony Tenser himself, all of which went to create an in-depth look not only at the making of the films but the machinations involved with running a film company. The book was critically acclaimed in a number of newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times and The Independent, as well as Film Review and SPFX (the latter dubbed it the \\"best single volume history ever written on British horror\\"). Hamilton has gone on to write a number of articles on Tigon film productions, published in magazines like The Darkside, Shivers and Little Shoppe of Horrors; in 2015, Hemlock Books published Tigon: Blood on a Budget, the author's look at the studio's horror and fantasy movies.

Career Fried was encouraged towards a music career by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the rebbe of Lubavitch, Mordechai Ben David and producer Sheya Mendlowitz. Fried began his career with the release of his first album No Jew Will Be Left Behind in 1981. The title song was composed by Yossi Green and the song \\"Kel Hahodaos\\" was written by Rabbi Boruch Chait / Kol Salonika, The Rabbis' Sons. Music by the Zimriah Orchestra, arranged by Marty Lewinter. Fried went on to collaborate with Sheya Mendlowitz and Yossi Green on eight albums. Green is credited with some of Fried's biggest hits, including \\"Aderaba\\", \\"Tanya\\", and \\"Didoh Bei\\". (note 2) Fried also collaborated most notably with arranger Moshe Laufer over the years, but worked with a number of other arrangers including Marty Lewinter, Yisroel Lamm (the Neginah Orchestra), Suki Berry, Mona Rosenblum, Hershel Lebovits, Yaron Gershovsky, and others. Avremel, as many of his friends call him had appeared as a guest soloist on the Amudai Shaish Orchestra's Wedding Album in 1981. During that same year he appeared as special guest star on Suki With A Touch Of Ding II - Wedding Album. He also appeared as an adult soloist on the Amudai Shaish Boys Choir's third album (their second double album), in 1982. He also sang on a number of all-star cast albums produced by Suki & Ding. In summer 2009, Fried made a concert tour in Israel where he introduced Israeli singer and composer Chanan Yovel and featured the songs \\"Rak T'filla\\" (\\"\\") and \\"U'Nesane Tokef\\" (\\"\\"). His first DVD was released in December 2009. Musical style His music is mostly categorized as pop Jewish music,Jerusalem Post, August 30, 2007 similar to Mordechai ben David and tends to integrate many styles of popular music, including pop, rock and jazz, with Jewish lyrics and themes. He also has a few \\"cantor\\" style songs on most of his albums, as well as many songs written in Yiddish. Family background Fried's grandfather, Rabbi Meir Yisroel Isser Friedman, was the Rav of Krenitz, a renowned halakhist and Sanzer Hasid. After World War II he resided in Borough Park, Brooklyn. His father, Yaakov Moshe Friedman, OBM, was a Hasid of the Rebbe of Bluzhov, and worked as an administrator at the United Lubavitcher Yeshiva in Crown Heights for 40 years. Fried is the youngest of eight children of the Friedman family. He has five brothers and two sisters. Fried and his siblings were all educated in Lubavitcher institutions, becoming Lubavitcher Hasidim. His brothers are all involved in Chabad outreach; his brother, Rabbi Manis Friedman, is an author, lecturer and shaliach (emissary) in St. Paul, Minnesota.Bensoussan, Barbara. \\"Speaking to the Soul: Rabbis Manis and Benny Friedman use their talents to awaken the pintele Yid\\".

In his early years his parents died and he was trained by an uncle. Singing, not study, attracted him, and at the age of twenty-three he fled to Mosul, where he joined a band of wild youths. After a year he went to Rayy, where he met an ambassador of the caliph al-Mansur, who enabled him to come to Basra and take singing lessons. His fame as a singer spread, and the caliph al-Mahdi brought him to the court. There he remained a favorite under al-Hadi, while Harun al-Rashid kept him always with him until his death, when he ordered his son al-Ma'mun to say the prayer over his corpse. Ibrahim, as might be expected, was no strict Muslim. Two or three times he was knouted and imprisoned for excess in wine-drinking, but was always taken into favor again. His powers of song were far beyond anything else known at the time. Two of his pupils, his son Ishaq al-Mawsili and the freedman slave Mukhariq, attained celebrity after him.

It is a lesser known fact, that Somdet Toh, was also the Grandson of His Majesty King Rama I of Thailand, and the son of His Majesty King Rama II, which was until recently a completely unknown fact, due to his mother not being of Royal Status, so the fact was never allowed to be known by the folk, during Somdet Toh's lifetime. This was of course because an illegitimate child, would damage the image of the State. This is however also the real reason that he reached such an elevated status as a monk, and was called to the Palace, and Given the Abbot-hood of Wat Rakhang, because he was the son of the second King of the Chakri Dynasty, but not an Heir to the Throne. Biography Somdet To was born in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, the illegitimate son of King Rama II.[Maha-Amarttri Phaya Thipkosa Sorn Lohanan, Biography of Somdet To, (Bangkok: Nithitham Printing, 1930)] He studied the Buddhist scriptures of the PƒÅli Canon with several Buddhist masters. After becoming a well-known monk, he became the preceptor for Prince Mongkut, later King Rama IV, when Mongkut became a monk. During Rama IV's reign Somdet To was given the ceremonial name Somdet Phra Buddhacarya (To Brahmaramsi) by the King and used to be one of his trusted advisers, having left a lot of teaching stories around him and the King.Legends of Somdet Toh He was noted for the skill of his preaching and his use of Thai poetry to reflect the beauty of Buddhism, and for making amulets called Somdej. The amulets were blessed by himself and other respected monks in Thailand. He also appears in many versions of the story of the ghost Mae Nak Phra Khanong, and he is said to be the one to finally subdue her.

They are based on an 8-bit RISC architecture and can reach speeds up to 100 MIPS on the Virtex 4 FPGA's family. The processors have an 8-bit address and data port for access to a wide range of peripherals. The license of the cores allows their free use, albeit only on Xilinx devices, and they come with development tools. Third party tools are available from Mediatronix and others. Also PacoBlaze, a behavioral and device independent implementation of the cores exists and is released under the BSD License. The PauloBlaze is an open source VHDL implementation under the Apache License. The PicoBlaze design was originally named KCPSM which stands for \\"Constant(K) Coded Programmable State Machine\\" (formerly \\"Ken Chapman's PSM\\"). Ken Chapman was the Xilinx systems designer who devised and implemented the microcontroller. Instantiation When instantiating a PicoBlaze microcontroller in VHDL, the respective KCPSM component name must be used. For example, for a PicoBlaze3 processor: component kcpsm3 is port ( address : out std_logic_vector(9 downto 0); instruction : in std_logic_vector(17 downto 0); port_id : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0); write_strobe : out std_logic; out_port : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0); read_strobe : out std_logic; in_port : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0); interrupt : in std_logic; interrupt_ack : out std_logic; reset : in std_logic; clk : in std_logic ); end component; Performance All instructions execute in two clock cycles, making performance of the core instruction set deterministic. Interrupt response is not more than five clock cycles. As a resource optimization, it is possible for two PicoBlaze cores to share the same 1k x 18 instruction PROM, taking advantage of the dual-ported implementation of this block on Xilinx FPGAs. Architectural notes Xilinx documents the PicoBlaze as requiring just 96 FPGA slices. The small implementation size is achieved in part through a fairly rigid separation of the instruction sequencing side (program counter, call-return stack, implied stack pointer, and interrupt enable bit) from the execution side (ALU, register file, scratchpad RAM, Z/C status bits). The only information which flows from the compute side to the sequencing side are the zero and carry ALU status bits, when tested by the conditional JUMP and CALL instructions. It is not possible to implement computed jumps or function pointers. The only information which flows from the sequencing side to the execution side are operand fields: destination register (4 bits), ALU opcode (six bits), optional source register (4 bits), optional 8-bit immediate value/port-address, optional 6-bit scratchpad address. There is no mechanism to inspect the value of the stack pointer, the contents of the 31-entry stack, the interrupt enable bit, or the contents of program memory. The instruction sequencing side does not contain an adder, so relative branches and position independent code are not possible. All jump and call addresses are absolute. The PicoBlaze is poorly suited to programming in compiled languages such as C. In addition to the lack of support for function pointers, there are no instructions or addressing modes to expedite a stack-based calling convention. For PicoBlaze it takes two instructions to implement PUSH or POP and two instructions to implement relative addressing off a software-designated stack pointer.

The cottage, built in the Shingle Style and completed in 1897, was designed by Willard T. Sears. It was given as a wedding present to Franklin and Eleanor, from Franklin's mother Sara Roosevelt. Here in August 1921, 39-year-old Roosevelt, who would go on to become the 32nd President of the United States, was stricken by a severe paralytic illness, believed to be polio at the time, leaving him permanently paralyzed from the waist down. FDR was no longer able to stay at the \\"beloved island\\", but he sailed there in 1933 and visited briefly in 1936 and 1939. Eleanor Roosevelt loved the cool summer weather and visited many times with her children and friends. Armand Hammer acquired the cottage in 1952.

As the son of famous Cantor David Werdyger he is known by his stage name Mordechai Ben David () or its initials, MBD. He is known as the \\"King of Jewish Music\\" and has released over 30 albums while performing worldwide. He has headlined the popular HASC and Ohel charity concerts for almost two decades. Genre Mordechai Ben David may be considered a pioneer of contemporary Hasidic song. He started his musical career in the early 1970s, a time when Hazzanut was the main source of recorded music in Jewish Orthodox circles, with very few solo singer performers. Two notable singers who preceded Werdyger were Bentzion Shenker and Shlomo Carlebach, who had started a genre rooted in Hasidic and American folk song in the early 1960s. Mordechai Ben David based his career on his father David's acclaim, choosing Mordechai Ben David (Mordechai the Son of David) as his stage name. In contrast to his father, who recorded classic Hasidic niggunim(songs) with cantorial vocals and classical instruments, Ben David blended traditional Hasidic singing with modern and popular music techniques. He was encouraged in this endeavor by Rabbi Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz, the Ribnitzer Rebbe. He soon became known as an innovator and rose quickly to become a musical superstar to Orthodox Jews worldwide. Ben David's music is considered \\"soul touching\\" and \\"spiritually uplifting\\", with most of the lyrics based on Hebrew prayer, Biblical passages, and religious poetry, known as Zemirot. Other songs, composed in English, Yiddish, and Modern Hebrew, carry religious themes such as the sanctity of Shabbat and the yearning for Mashiach. His recordings include traditional Hasidic melodies of Eastern European folk-style alongside more modern jazz, pop, and rock music. Throughout his career, Werdyger has worked with many composers and arrangers, most notably Yisroel Lamm (the Neginah Orchestra) and Moshe (Mona) Rosenblum, as well as Suki Berry, Moshe Laufer and Yossi Green, Boruch Chait and Abie Rotenberg, Hershel Lebovits and Nachman Klein. He himself has composed many songs that he has recorded. He has also collaborated side by side with well known musicians including Yaron Gershovsky (director of the Manhattan Transfer), Daniel Freiberg and Ken Burgess. Over the years, Mordechai appeared as a guest soloist on a number of albums recorded by his father, the late Cantor David Werdyger. Later years he appeared on albums produced and sung by his son Yeedle Werdyger, and brother Mendy Werdyger, both of whom are known singers in their own rights. He has appeared on a number of \\"All Star Cast\\" albums produced by Suki & Ding. MBD's style has been an inspiration to many Jewish singers over the past decades; following his genre are famous headline singers such as Avraham Fried, Lipa Schmeltzer, and Yaakov Shwekey, as well as some of the younger stars like Benny Friedman, Simcha Leiner, Levy Falkowitz and Shmueli Ungar. Together with well-known producer Sheya Mendlowitz, Mordechai produced the first solo recording album of singer Avraham Fried entitled \\"No Jew Will Be Left Behind\\" (with songs composed by Yossi Green and the Zimriah Orchestra arranged by Marty Lewinter) in 1981. During that same year, Sheya was involved with the production of two of Mordechai's releases, \\"Mordechai Ben David Live\\" (his first live album) and \\"Memories\\", written in memory of Mordechai's mother, and featuring songs composed by Yerachmiel Begun (of Toronto and Miami Boys Choir fame). In fact during the following few years, Sheya & Mordechai jointly produced a number of hit albums together including \\"Mostly Horas\\" (1987), his own album \\"MBD & Friends\\" (1987), \\"Yisroel Lamm & The Philharmonic Experience\\" (1988), and \\"25 Years of Jewish Music\\" (1988). In addition, Sheya went on to produce both Mordechai's \\"Simen Tov -Keitzad\\" (one of the first ever Jewish music \\"single\\" releases) (1989) and \\"The Double Album\\" (1990). Music and politics Some of Werdyger's songs have carried political messages. In 1984 and 1985, MBD's songs \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Let My People Go\\" focused on the Jewish refusenik plight behind the Soviet Iron Curtain. While \\"Hold On\\" expresses hope, \\"Let My People Go\\" specifically calls for \\"support and pressure\\" to free Anatoly Natan Sharansky and Ida Nudel from Soviet captivity. In 1986 MBD's quasi-rock beat \\"Jerusalem Is Not For Sale\\" spearheaded the Haredi opposition to Mormon missionary practice in Jerusalem. The lyrics read \\"You better run for your life, back to Utah overnight, before the mountain top opens wide to swallow you inside.\\" as well as \\"The wars, the pain, brought masses returning, back to their roots more than ever. The leftists fiercely fighting truth, dampening the sparks still burning. So wake up my friend, this is the very end, the arrows are pointing our way!\\"http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Mass-Protest-Against-Mormon- Building/id-0055d9ef7dbbe1808d53c67887e72505http://emp.byui.edu/ANDERSONR/itc/Israel/jerusalemCenter/rally.htm 1994's \\"Yerushalayim We Will Never Leave You\\", recorded in Hebrew and English, protested the intent of dividing Jerusalem under the Oslo I Accord. MBD released a single track in 1996, named \\"Chevron Always And Forever\\" (heb. ◊ó◊ë◊®◊ï◊ü ◊û◊ê◊ñ ◊ï◊ú◊™◊û◊ô◊ì), protesting proposed Israeli concessions over Hebron under the Oslo II Interim Agreement. In 1999, on a track sung in Hebrew, \\"Ad Matay\\" (heb.◊¢◊ì ◊û◊™◊ô), written by Chaim Walder, Werdyger took on tensions between Israeli secular and religious parties. This dramatic composition expressed a heart-wrenching cry against internal hatred and takes an indirect shot at anti-religious politicians Yossi Sarid (Meretz) and Tommy Lapid (Shinui) by rhyming their surnames into a phrase depicting \\"the flame of hatred [lapid lit flame] which leaves no remnants [sarid lit remnant]\\". In 2010, MBD re-wrote his famous English song \\"Unity\\", expressing protest of alleged Federal injustice to Sholom Rubashkin in his widely publicized case in the U.S. The song, renamed \\"Unity For Justice\\", was performed by MBD together with Avraham Fried and forty famous Jewish singers. An HD Video recording was publicized on a petition website as well as the social network.http://www.chabad.info/index.php?id=20569&url;=article_en =Obama controversy= In 2016, Mordechai Ben David attracted controversy after a video taken at his December 28 concert in Jerusalem, wherein he referred to US President Barack Obama with the derogatory Hebrew racial term kushi, was circulated online.Newsweek.com Popular Jewish singer makes racial slur against Obama at Jerusalem concert, January 4, 2017JTA.org Hasidic singer MBD slams Obama with racial slur at Jerusalem concert, January 3, 2017 During the concert, Ben David was between songs while performing a song about peace before thousands of people in the Israeli capital when he remarked to the audience in Hebrew, \\"Do you know when there will be peace? In a few weeks, when there will be a new president in the United States and the kushi goes home.\\" The statement prompted cheers from the audience, which included Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat and Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, both of whom had previously criticized Obama and expressed approval of President-elect Donald Trump. The statement prompted criticism from several outlets, many of whom characterized the term \\"kushi\\" as a racial slur and accused Ben David and his audience of racism. In defense of the singer, Rabbi Yair Hoffman, in an opinion piece for Yeshiva World News, criticized media coverage of the incident, noting that the audience had cheered after \\"there will be a new president\\" rather than at the racial term and arguing that Ben-David's use of the term, while \\"wrong\\" and meriting an apology, was not necessarily pejorative or derogatory. Family His father, David Werdyger, was a hazzan (cantor) and Holocaust survivor originally from Krak√≥w. His brother, Mendy, is also a Jewish singer and owner of the Jewish record label Aderet Records and its retail store in Boro Park, Brooklyn, Mostly Music. His son, Yeedle, and nephew, Yisroel Werdyger (Mendy's son), are also popular Jewish singers. His wife, Esther, is the daughter and sister of hazzanim. His brother-in-law is Cantor Ari Klein, who in the past recorded a few albums of his own. And his cousin, Shmilu Rosenberg of Canada released two albums back in the 1980s, a comeback album and an appearance on an all-star album in the 1990s. In April 2017, Werdyger wrote and released a song titled \\"Boee Besholom\\" dedicated to the marriage of his granddaughter. The song was sung at the wedding by Werdyger and Lipa Schmeltzer who was one of the guests. The arrangements on that single were done by and , a young and popular Israeli musical duo, who then rearranged it for his album, Tzeaka (released in June 2017), as a Jewish Pop/Techno song named \\"Bo'ee Kallah\\", which quickly became one of the biggest dance hits of the year. Current activities Werdyger continues to work on recordings in his private studio in Sea Gate, Brooklyn, and cooperates with contemporary music producer Eli Lishinsky. The album before his most recent one, titled Kissufim, was released in October 2011. This production was said to be his last album, with MBD stating that illegal CD burning and internet downloads were ruining the industry and making albums financially unprofitable.http://www.vosizneias.com/92341 After great success with Kissufim, in February 2012, MBD announced on Menachem Toker Radio Israel that he had just started on a new album, although he did not release information about the type of album. At about the same time, he also unofficially released a non-public single titled \\"Omdos Hoyu\\" in honor of a Yeshiva Student's marriage in Israel, and although it was only released at the event in Israel, it has become widely popular through being posted on the web. Another single released was \\"Yachad Shivtei Yisrael\\",http://jewishmusicreport.com/2012/07/31/mbd-sings-new-song-for-the- siyum-yachad/ composed in honor of the 2012 Siyum HaShas. A single composed for the Jewish Holy Days of Awe labeled \\"Nekom\\" was released in 2015. Then, six years after the release of his last full album, he finally released a brand new album Tzeaka in June 2017. The album features many new hits in different genres and includes guest soloists such Motty Steimetz and Nussi Fuchs. Werdyger does not sing at mixed concerts for religious reasons.http://jewishmusicreport.com/2013/01/14/hasc-xxvi-concert-recap/ Werdyger lives in Sea Gate, Brooklyn, and has mentioned that he has purchased a house in Jerusalem and intends to move there shortly.  Song adaptations  A few of MBD's songs are adaptations of well-known, non-Jewish songs. *\\"Hinei Lo Yanum\\" on Hineni (1975) is an adaptation of \\"Mamy Blue\\", originally composed by veteran French songwriter Hubert Giraud in 1970. In May 1971, Alain Milhaud, a French record producer based in Spain, acquired the song for Pop-Tops. *\\"Lichtiger Shabbos\\" on Just One Shabbos (1982) [retitled \\"Yiddish\\" on Solid MBD (1993)] is an adaptation of \\"Close Every Door To Me\\", from the musical theater production Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. *\\"Kumt Aheim\\" on Jerusalem: Not For Sale (1986), commonly referred to as \\"Yidden\\" and retitled as such for the CD release, uses the music of \\"Dschinghis Khan\\" (English: Genghis Khan), from the German band Dschinghis Khan. *\\"Father Dear\\" on Yerushalayim Our Home (1988) [retitled \\"Daddy Dear\\" on The English Collection (1998)] uses music from the song \\"Little Boy and the Old Man\\", written by singer-songwriter Wayne Shanklin. *\\"Shir Hashalom\\" is an adaptation from Bobby Vinton's \\"My Melody of Love\\". In addition, \\"Vechol Maminim\\", from MBD's album of the same name, was an adaptation of \\"Tov Lehodos\\", an earlier song by Shlomo Carlebach.

He held the dual roles of chief spiritual and military leader, and had the authority to make decisions regarding security particularly the waging of war.Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. 48 Notable Orkoiik include Kimnyole Arap Turukat, Koitalel Arap Samoei and Barsirian Arap Manyei. Etymology The origin of the word is unknown though Huntinford (1927) speculates that the word orkoiyot derives from koiyo (raided cattle). The word predates the office it would represent among the Nandi as evinced by its presence in other Kalenjin communities e.g Kony (ork≈çan, ork≈çandet) and Suk (werkoiyon). It was originally applied to a class of wizards who were perceived to be of a benevolent nature and were thus tolerated and were distinct from ponik, a class of wizards who were perceived to only be evil. Huntingford (1972) notes that the men-folk of the Kamwaike oret were the traditional orkoiik in Nandi before the Masai family of Kapuso took the pre- eminence from them. History =Origins= The office that the Orkoiyot held was referred to as the OrkoinotetGenealogy of the Nadi Orkoiyot from Kipsegun to Samoei online and was established among the Nandi by Kipsegun, a Segelai Maasai. The abilities that distinguished an Orkoiyot were hereditary and thus the office passed on to his son Arap Kipsegun though their dynasty was short-lived and ended with the son.Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. 50 The second dynasty was founded through a woman named Moki chebo Cheplabot, the wife of a Maasai Laibon who fled during a war with the Nandi while pregnant. She later bore two sons, Kopokoii and Barsapotwa, while hiding in caves near Keben in the Mogobich Valley. Moki and her sons, the former who would become the first Orkoiyot of the second and last dynasty, were captured and adopted into the Talai clan.East African Standard, Why leaders seek blessings in a Nandi Village, Nov.2009 online The Talai are a widespread Kalenjin clan and among the Nandi are aligned with the Lion Totem. =Genealogical Table= The Orkoinotet lasted for over fifty years and went through a period of a dual administration during the time of Arap Kipsegun and Kopokoii until the former was ousted.Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore.

The Hamiltonian for test particle motion in Kerr spacetime is separable in Boyer‚ÄìLindquist coordinates. Using Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi theory one can derive a fourth constant of the motion known as Carter's constant. The 1967 paper introducing Boyer-Lindquist coordinates was a posthumous publication for Robert H. Boyer, who was killed in the 1966 University of Texas tower shooting. Line element The line element for a black hole with a total mass equivalent M, angular momentum J, and charge Q in Boyer‚ÄìLindquist coordinates and natural units (G=c=1) is : ds^2 = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{\\\\rho^2}\\\\left(dt - a \\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\phi \\\\right)^2 +\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{\\\\rho^2}\\\\Big(\\\\left(r^2+a^2\\\\right)\\\\,d\\\\phi - a \\\\,dt\\\\Big)^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\rho^2}{\\\\Delta}dr^2 + \\\\rho^2 \\\\,d\\\\theta^2 where :\\\\Delta = r^2 - 2Mr + a^2 + Q^2, called the discriminant, :\\\\rho^2 = r^2 + a^2 \\\\cos^2\\\\theta, and :a = \\\\frac{J}{M}, called the Kerr parameter. Note that in natural units M, a, and Q all have units of length. This line element describes the Kerr‚ÄìNewman metric. Here, M is to be interpreted as the mass of the black hole, as seen by an observer at infinity, J is interpreted as the angular momentum, and Q the electric charge. These are all meant to be constant parameters, held fixed. The name of the discriminant arises because it appears as the discriminant of the quadratic equation bounding time-like motion of particles orbiting the black hole, i.e. defining the ergosphere. The coordinate transformation from Boyer‚ÄìLindquist coordinates r, \\\\theta, \\\\phi to Cartesian coordinates x, y, z is given by :\\\\begin{align} x &= \\\\sqrt {r^2 + a^2} \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\phi  y &= \\\\sqrt {r^2 + a^2} \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\phi  z &= r \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\end{align} Vierbein The vierbein one-forms can be read off directly from the line element: :\\\\sigma^0 = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt\\\\Delta}{\\\\rho}\\\\left(dt - a \\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\phi \\\\right) :\\\\sigma^1 = \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\sqrt\\\\Delta}dr :\\\\sigma^2 = \\\\rho \\\\,d\\\\theta :\\\\sigma^3 = \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\theta}{\\\\rho}\\\\Big(\\\\left(r^2+a^2\\\\right)\\\\,d\\\\phi - a \\\\,dt\\\\Big) so that the line element is give by :ds^2=\\\\sigma^a\\\\otimes\\\\sigma^b \\\\eta_{ab} where \\\\eta_{ab} is the flat-space Minkowski metric. Spin connection The torsion-free spin connection \\\\omega^{ab} is defined by :d\\\\sigma^a + \\\\omega^{ab} \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^c \\\\eta_{bc}=0 The contorsion tensor gives the difference between a connection with torsion, and a corresponding connection without torsion. By convention, Riemann manifolds are always specified with torsion-free geometries; torsion is often used to specify equivalent, flat geometries. The spin connection is useful, because it provides an intermediate way-point for computing the curvature two-form: :R^{ab}=d\\\\omega^{ab}+\\\\omega^{ac}\\\\wedge\\\\omega^{db}\\\\eta_{cd} It is also the most suitable form for describing the coupling to spinor fields, and opens the door to the twistor formalism. All six components of the spin connection are non- vanishing. These are:Pietro Giuseppe Fr√®, \\"Gravity,a Geometrical Course, Volume 2: Black Holes, Cosmology and Introduction to Supergravity\\", (2013) Springer-Verlag :\\\\omega^{01}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho^3} \\\\left[\\\\frac{-2Mr^2+2rQ^2+a^2[M+r+(M-r)\\\\cos 2\\\\theta]}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}}\\\\,\\\\sigma^0 +ra\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\sigma^3\\\\right] :\\\\omega^{02}=\\\\frac{a\\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\rho^3} \\\\left[a\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\sigma^0+\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}\\\\,\\\\sigma^3\\\\right] :\\\\omega^{03}=\\\\frac{a}{\\\\rho^3} \\\\left[r\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\sigma^1-\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\sigma^2\\\\right] :\\\\omega^{12}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho^3} \\\\left[a^2\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\sigma^1+r\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}\\\\,\\\\sigma^2\\\\right] :\\\\omega^{13}=\\\\frac{r}{\\\\rho^3} \\\\left[a\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\sigma^0+\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}\\\\,\\\\sigma^3\\\\right] :\\\\omega^{23}=\\\\frac{\\\\cot\\\\theta}{\\\\rho^3} \\\\left[a\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta}\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\sigma^0+(r^2+a^2)\\\\,\\\\sigma^3\\\\right] Riemann and Ricci tensors The Riemann tensor written out in full is quite verbose; it can be found in Fr√®. The Ricci tensor takes the diagonal form: :\\\\mbox{Ric}=\\\\frac{Q^2}{\\\\rho^4} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 0 & -1 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\\\end{bmatrix} Notice the location of the minus-one entry: this comes entirely from the electromagnetic contribution. Namely, when the electromagnetic stress tensor F_{ab} has only two non-vanishing components: F_{01} and F_{23}, then the corresponding energy-momentum tensor takes the form :T^\\\\mbox{Maxwell}=\\\\frac{F_{01}^2+F_{23}^2}{4} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 0 & -1 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\\\end{bmatrix} Equating this with the energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field leads to the Kerr-Newman electrovacuum solution.

History The first development in the area may have been when Richard Goldsmith Meares established a lime-burning kiln in 1831. Meares had arrived at the Swan River Colony with Thomas Peel in the previous year. As the area was adjacent to the relatively safe harbour of Owen's Anchorage in Cockburn Sound, the area began to be used as an alternative destination point for ship arrivals. In 1898, a railway was built from Fremantle to Robb Jetty. At that time, an abattoir was built for slaughter of livestock arriving from the north-west of the state including the Kimberley Region. Livestock were unloaded from the ships onto a jetty. Extensive pasturing for the animals as well as small market gardens were established in the region around the abattoir. The Coogee Hotel was built in 1901, and in 1903 the railway was extended to Woodman Point. Commercial lime kilns were established during this period to provide for the construction boom and population growth which had been brought about by gold discoveries. The Newmarket Hotel on the border of Hamilton Hill and South Fremantle, was often identified as being in either of the suburbs. The area steadily became the centre of much of Perth's heavy industry and comprised the coal-fired power station, railway marshalling yards, abattoir as well as numerous skin drying sheds. From the 1980s however, pressures brought on by demands for residential housing triggered a process of removal of the various facilities. South Beach South Beach is an area of beach and adjacent land in South Fremantle. The beach and the disused railway station are parts of the South Fremantle community history.

She appeared in such films as Lionheart (1987), Alien Terminator (1988), the 1990 comedy, Bullseye! (opposite her father), Chaplin (1992), Into the Sun (1992), and South Kensington (2001). She is probably best known in the UK as the face of the Scottish Widows advertising campaign from 1986 to 1995 when she was replaced by Amanda Lamb. She later took on the name Deborah Moore. She has twice made appearances in James Bond-related productions. She played a secretary in the 1989 biopic Goldeneye: The Secret Life of Ian Fleming and later made a cameo appearance as a flight attendant in the 2002 Bond film, Die Another Day, which was Pierce Brosnan¬¥s fourth and final Bond film. She also appeared in the 1998 TV movie Merlin: The Quest Begins, opposite Jason Connery, son of former Bond Sean Connery. Her godfather was the late actor Robert Brown, her father's co-star in the television series Ivanhoe and 3 Bond films. In 2006, Moore made the film Provoked.

He was the second son of Sir William Gordon Gordon-Cumming, 2nd Baronet and Lady Eliza Maria Gordon-Cumming From his early years he was distinguished by his passion for sport. He was educated at Eton, England, and at eighteen joined the East India Company's service as a cornet in the Madras Light Cavalry. The climate of India not suiting him, after two years he retired from the service and returned to Scotland. During his stay in the East he had laid the foundation of his collection of hunting trophies and specimens of natural history. In 1843 he joined the Cape Mounted Rifles, but for the sake of absolute freedom sold out at the end of the year and with an ox wagon and a few native followers set out for the interior of Africa. He hunted chiefly in Bechuanaland and the valley of the Limpopo River, regions then swarming with big game. In 1848 he returned to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The story of his exploits is vividly told in his book, Five Years of a Hunter's Life in the Far Interior of South Africa (London, 1850, 3rd ed. 1851). Of this volume, received at first with incredulity by stay-at-home critics, David Livingstone, who furnished Gordon-Cumming with most of his native guides, wrote: I have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Cumming's book conveys a truthful idea of South African hunting (Missionary Travels, chap. vii.). But this comment ought not to be read as implying Livingstone's approval of Gordon-Cumming's 'nauseating details of indiscriminate slaughter of wild animals' (David and Charles Livingstone, \\"Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi and Its Tributaries: And of the Discovery of the Lakes Shirwa and Nyassa, 1858-1864\\", J. Murray, 1865, p. 197). Livingstone in general considered Gordon-Cumming as \\"a mad sort of Scotchman\\" who caused him difficulties. When Gordon-Cumming's oxen succumbed to Animal African trypanosomiasis Livingstone was obliged to change his plans and send all his own oxen to extricate the hunter and his entourage (George Seaver, \\"David Livingstone: His Life and Letters\\", Lutterworth Press, 1957, p. 105). Worse still, when Gordon-Cumming supplied Setshele, the ruler of the Kw√™na people of Botswana, with guns in exchange for ivory, it was Livingstone who was blamed for arming the Africans and in revenge Hendrik Potgieter‚Äôs followers sacked the Kolobeng mission, taking the African women and children of the mission into slavery (cf. Isaac Schapera, ‚ÄòLivingstone and the Boers‚Äô in African Affairs, Vol. 59, No. 235, Apr., 1960, pp. 144‚Äì156). Gordon-Cumming's collection of hunting trophies was exhibited in London in 1851 at the Great Exhibition, and was illustrated by a lecture delivered by Gordon-Cumming. The collection, known as The South Africa Museum, was afterwards exhibited in various parts of the United Kingdom. In 1858 Gordon-Cumming went to live at Fort Augustus, Scotland, on the Caledonian Canal, where the exhibition of his trophies attracted many visitors. He died there in 1866. An abridgment of his book was published in 1856 under the title of The Lion Hunter of South Africa, and in this form was frequently reprinted, a new edition appearing in 1904.

Biography  Leo Sirota began studying piano at the age of five. By the age of nine he was already giving concerts and came to the attention of Paderewski, who invited the boy to study with him. Sirota's parents, however, felt he was too young, and so he attended the conservatories in Kiev and, later, Saint Petersburg. However, in 1904 he went to Vienna to study with Ferruccio Busoni. He worked as rehearsal pianist with the conductor Jascha Horenstein, whose sister, Augustine Horenstein, he married. Sirota's Vienna debut concert must have been a memorable occasion: it comprised the Mozart sonata for two pianos with Busoni playing the other piano, followed by the Busoni Piano Concerto, with Busoni conducting, and ended with the two piano version of the Liszt Don Juan Fantasy. Sirota and his family settled in Japan in 1929, staying there for 16 years, teaching and giving recitals. He was a piano teacher of Minoru Matsuya (1910‚Äì1995) and Takahiro Sonoda (1928-2004). While in Japan, he championed Yamaha pianos against the prevailing fashion in Japan for Bechstein and Steinway instruments. During World War II, he and his wife were interned in Karuizawa, Nagano, while his daughter was safe in the United States. After the Second World War he moved to America and taught in St. Louis. A local radio station frequently asked him to broadcast, and much of his surviving recorded output comes from the paper-based tapes that the studio gave to him after each broadcast. His repertoire was vast, including the complete works of Chopin, which he broadcast. His playing is characterised by a luminous tone and unfussy, almost fastidious interpretations, underpinned by an astonishing technique - his rendition of Rosenthal's arrangement of Chopin's minute waltz with the right hand in thirds was said to have astounded Arthur Rubinstein. Because his recorded legacy required specialised remastering, it is only recently that his stature as a pianist has been appreciated. Sirota died in 1965. His daughter was Beate Sirota Gordon.

Originally, the markings consisted of a circle with a vertical line from the edge of the circle pointing in the direction of travel (straight ahead, left turn, right turn). Other common markings are a circle X to denote wrong way, and a circled horizontal line to denote caution. Variations on the circle pattern developed to differentiate between different rides as more and more rides began to use the same roads. Variations include color, triangles, squares, letters, etc. Other cycling related inventions by Henry include front and rear suspension systems and the 'sling' saddle.

It runs on Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh based PCs. The software debuted in 1994. The principal idea of ReCycle is to alter the tempo of a music loop without changing its pitch or otherwise altering its sound. ReCycle does this by \\"slicing\\" loops into a series of separate \\"beats\\" or \\"hits\\" and altering their timing (or even quantizing them) without altering the length of the individual slices, thus allowing the loop to play at a different speed whilst using the unmodified sounds for each individual slice/drum hit, a process which fully preserves the original pitch of the loop while allowing a great variety of speed/timing tweaks. ReCycle can also assign each successive slice to a respective MIDI note on a scale.Huber, D.M. 2005. Modern Recording Techniques, 6th Edition. Focal Press. Chapter 6, p.295. ReCycle was the first program to popularize the idea of loop slicing.Souvignier, Todd (1 April 2003). \\"Closing the Loop \\". Electronic Musician. Retrieved on 1 April 2008.

Additionally, he held a portion of the Bavarian province of Straubing, his Bavarian ducal line's appanage and seat. The Trinity with Albrecht of Bavaria (1400-1404). Biography Silver groat or 'voetdrager', struck under Albert of Bavaria. Mintplace: Dordrecht 1389-1404. Albert was born in Munich, the third son of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, by his second wife Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut and Holland. Albert was originally a younger son, apportioned at best an appanage. He was only 10 years old when his father died, leaving most of his Bavarian inheritance to his eldest half-brother, Louis V, Duke of Bavaria, but also some appanages to the younger sons. His elder brother, William V, Count of Holland, had engaged in a long struggle with their mother, obtaining Holland and Zeeland from her in 1354, and Hainaut on her death in 1356. William was supported by the party of burghers of the cities. They were opposed in this by the Hook faction, the party of disaffected nobles who were supporters of Empress Margaret. Margaret had resigned her sovereignty in favour of her son William V, but the result was a period of great upheavals and chaos which gave rise to the formation of these two opposing parties. However, William's insanity resulted in the appointment of the then 22-year- old Albert as governor (or regent or ruwaard) of his brother's territories from 1358 onwards. During Albert's regency, affairs ran smoothly and trade improved. Troubles between the two political parties, the Hoeks (\\"Hooks\\") and Kabeljauws (\\"Cods\\"), remained barely beneath the surface. William lived for another thirty years. Albert did not formally succeed him until his death in 1388, by which time he had already arranged the marriage of his daughters to a number of Imperial princes and other nobles. The eldest daughter to have children was Margaret; her son Philip III, Duke of Burgundy would ultimately inherit Albert's territories. In Albert's own reign, troubles erupted between the Hoeks and the Kabeljauws because of a woman. Albert always had mistresses, but this time his attentions were drawn to Aleid van Poelgeest, a member of the Kabeljauw party. She was considered very beautiful and was able to gain political influence which was resented. A plot was hatched among the Hoeks as well as members of Albert's household. On 22 September 1392 Aleid was murdered in The Hague. In his rage Albert persecuted the Hoeks, by sword and fire, conquering one castle after the other. Even his own son and heir, William, did not feel safe and went to live in Hainault. During his last years, Albert fought the Frisians. They were beaten time and time again, but were never completely conquered. On Albert's death in 1404, he was succeeded by his eldest son, William. A younger son, John III, became Bishop of Li√®ge. However, on William's death in 1417, a war of succession broke out between John and William's daughter Jacqueline of Hainaut. This would be the last episode of the Hook and Cod wars and would lead to the counties being placed into Burgundian hands. Albrecht van Beieren, graaf van Holland en Henegouwen. Family and children Coats of Arms of the Counts of Hainaut and Holland of Wittelsbach family. Albert married in Passau after 19 July 1353, Margaret of Brieg from Silesia (1342/43 - 1386), and had seven children, all of whom lived to adulthood: # Katherine of Bavaria (c. 1361 - 1400, Hattem), married in Geertruidenberg in 1379 William I of Gelders and J√ºlich. # Johanna of Bavaria (c. 1362 - 1386), married Wenceslaus, King of the Romans. # Margaret of Bavaria (1363 - 23 January 1423, Dijon), married in Cambrai in 1385 John the Fearless. # William VI, Count of Holland (1365-1417), father of Jacqueline of Hainault. # Albert II, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing (1369 - 21 January 1397, Kelheim). # Joanna Sophia (c. 1373 - 15 November 1410, Vienna), married on 15 June 1395 Albert IV, Duke of Austria. # John, Count of Holland (1374/76 - 1425), Bishop of Li√®ge. He also had several illegitimate children. Albert contracted a second marriage in 1394 in Heusden with Margaret of Cleves (c. 1375 - 1412), sister of Adolph I, Duke of Cleves, but they had no children. He died in The Hague, aged 68.

Bradley was the first Justice appointed to the newly created ninth seat (subsequent to the prior abolition of certain other seats). The Judiciary Act of 1869, sometimes called the Circuit Judges Act of 1869, a United States statute, provided that the Supreme Court of the United States would consist of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, established separate judgeships for the U.S. circuit courts, and for the first time included a provision allowing federal judges to retire without losing their salary. This is the most recent legislation altering the size of the Supreme Court. In addition, it stipulated that each of the nine circuit courts of the United States would have a circuit judge appointed who would reside in that locale and have the same power and jurisdiction as the Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. It was stipulated that the chief justice and each of the associate justices had the duty to sit at least one term in the circuit every two years. The circuit court could be held by the circuit judge, the Supreme Court justice, or the two could hold the court together, in which case the Supreme Court justice would preside. Up until this time, circuit courts were normally only staffed by district judges and Supreme Court justices \\"riding circuit.\\" The salary of the circuit court judgeships created was set at $5,000 a year. In addition, the act stipulated that federal judges (including Supreme Court justices) who had served for ten years or more would receive a pension upon their retirement. The pension was set at the salary of the judge at the time of retirement. A judge had to be at least seventy years old at the time of retirement. There were eight justices serving on the Supreme Court at the time the act was enacted. The Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 had provided that the Court be reduced in size from ten to seven justices, but the reduction was to occur only as seats were vacated. Only one seat was vacated between the 1866 and 1869 acts, this was in addition to the one vacancy that already existed when the 1866 act was enacted. The 1869 act had the effect of creating a single new seat, Joseph P. Bradley was the first Justice appointed to this newly created seat. An earlier version of this legislation had been approved by the 40th Congress at the close of the session in March 1869, but fell victim to a pocket veto from outgoing president Andrew Johnson. The act was the third time that Congress had created circuit judgeships. The first time was the soon-repealed Judiciary Act of 1801, and the second was a single circuit judgeship in the frontier state of California which only lasted from 1855 to 1863. Though the law did not abolish circuit riding by the justices of the Supreme Court, it significantly reduced the burden by requiring each justice to attend circuit court in each district within his circuit only once every two years. Circuit court riding would later be abolished by the Judiciary Act of 1891. The circuit courts themselves were abolished by the Judicial Code of 1911, which transferred their trial jurisdiction to the U.S. district courts.

Evarts, created the United States courts of appeals, and reassigned the jurisdiction of most routine appeals from the district and circuit courts to these appellate courts. Because of this, it is also called the Circuit Courts of Appeals Act. The Act created nine new courts, originally known as the \\"United States circuit courts of appeals\\" (the name was changed to its current form in 1948). Each court was composed of two circuit judges and one district judge. The new courts had jurisdiction over most appeals of lower court decisions. The Supreme Court could review legal issues that a court of appeals certified to it, and could also review court of appeals decisions by writ of certiorari. This change resulted in an immediate reduction in the Supreme Court's workload (from 623 cases filed in 1890 to 379 in 1891 and 275 in 1892). However, Congress provided that some types of cases could be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the new courts of appeals. The Act also eliminated the requirement of \\"circuit riding\\" by Supreme Court justices, under which the justices sat as trial judges on the U.S. circuit courts. The circuit courts themselves remained in existence, although without their former appellate jurisdiction, until they were abolished and their trial jurisdiction transferred to the district courts by the Judicial Code of 1911. The Act allowed certain types of cases to be appealed directly to the Supreme Court (bypassing the new circuit courts of appeals) ‚Äî such as convictions for capital crimes; cases involving the construction or application of the United States Constitution; or cases in which a federal law or treaty, or a state constitution or law, was alleged to violate the U.S. Constitution.

Rideout, Sherwood Anderson: A Writer in America: v. 2, University of Wisconsin Press, 2007, p. 172 which made its first monthly appearance in November 1932. It was edited by George Jean Nathan, though Eugene O'Neill, Ernest Boyd, Theodore Dreiser,R. Baird Schuman, Great American Writers: Twentieth Century, Marshall Cavendish Corporation, 2002, p. 378 and James Branch Cabell were also listed as joint editors.Linda Ben-Zvi, Susan Glaspell: Her Life and Times, OUP USA, 2005, p. 167 The original editors left the publication in 1935, after which the paper continued monthly publication under new editors until October 1936. The American Spectator lasted another six months on a bimonthly before folding altogether.Keith Newlin, A Theodore Dreiser Encyclopedia, Greenwood Press, 2003 Sherwood Anderson first published his short story entitled Brother Death in this journal. In 1933, the journal published a discussion, including some humor that not everyone recognized, on the Jewish question.On Dreiser's anti- Semitism see Donald Pizer, Theodore Dreiser: Interviews, University of Illinois Press, 2005, p.335 ; Gary Levine, The Merchant of Modernism: The Economic Jew in Anglo-American Literature 1864-1939 (Literary Criticism & Cultural Theory: Outstanding Dissertations), Routledge, 2002, p. 75 Anticipation The publication was heralded before the first issue had even been published. A mainstream newspaper gossip columnist wrote: \\"New York's literati are in a furious flutter over the last word in literary high-hatting which is to be launched... Nathan and Boyd will be the office editors and O'Neill, Lewis and Dreiser, editorial writers... contributors will only contribute by special invitation from the editors... Payment for material to editors and other contributors will be one cent a word. No salaries whatever are to be paid Nathan and Boyd until financial conditions, if ever, warrant it... Contributors who have consented include Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Mann, James Joyce, William Faulkner...\\"O.O. McIntyre, The Newest in Literary Snooping Due to Appear This Fall, McIntyre Reveals, Milwaukee Sentinel, July 23, 1932, p. 23 None of those famous authors were ever published in The American Spectator, but the paper went on to become successful nonetheless. Mission The American Spectator laid out its mission and purpose in an editorial in the first issue: \\"The American Spectator has no policy in the common sense of that word... Sincerity, authenticity, and passion are its editorial criterion. Its aim is to offer a medium for the truly valuable and adventurous in thought, and to invite contributions from every quarter where stimulating opinions may be expected Clarity, vigor, and humor and the three indispensable qualities which must inform the presentation of its ideas. Real knowledge and a decided point of view will replace the usual conventional comment on irrelevant or foregone conclusions. The essential editorial problem of the better and more ambitious type of monthly magazine is that it is much too large‚Ä¶ Another defect of the average magazine is that its editor often permits himself to remain in harness long after his imaginative oats have given out and the magazine thereafter continues simply as a matter of habit. The moment the editors feel that The American Spectator is becoming a routine job, is getting dull and is similarly continuing as a matter of habit, they will call it a day and will retire in a body to their estates. The editors of The American Spectator have invited distinguished writers in America, England, France, Germany, Austria and Italy to join them in contributing to its columns, and the almost unanimous response has been immensely gratifying. Each invited writer has been asked to write on what interests him most at the moment and each writer will be his own editor. It will be the policy of The American Spectator, in short, to have no policy that will in any way interfere with or restrain any expression of opinion that any of its invited writers may desire to offer‚Ä¶\\"The American Spectator, Vol. I Issue I, UNZ.org Articles were capped at 2,000 words and the newspaper refused to sell advertising. The first issue was so successful that an additional 20,000 copies had to be printed to meet demand, despite what was then considered a high price of fifty cents. Subsequent issues sold for ten cents. The Jewish Question The September 1933 issue featured a roundtable about the Jewish people's movement for a homeland titled \\"Editorial Conference (With Wine).\\"The American Spectator, September 1933, UNZ.org The piece was intended to be funny, but not received as humorous. Instead it was widely criticized as anti-Semitic. The statements of Boyd, Nathan, O'Neill, and Cabell were openly derisive of Jewish people and their desire for a homeland. Dreiser, although in favor of a Jewish homeland, was nonetheless seen as anti-Semitic because he made stereotypical comments about the \\"shrewdness\\" of Jews when it came to money. American journalist Hutchins Hapgood was among the most vocal critics of the piece, attacking Drieser as anti-Semitic in a letter that The American Spectator refused to publish. Hapgood's strident letter was finally published in the April 1935 issue of the Nation. Anti-Hitler Position The editors of The American Spectator were among the first Americans to question the rise of fascism in Germany and to denounce the Nazi party. In an August 1933 front- page editorial, the paper warned about the imminent problems of Hitler's thinking. \\"That recently naturalized German, Herr Adolf Hitler, has undertaken to define Germanism and Aryanism with such a complete disregard for the ascertainable facts of biology, anthropology and German history that one wearily realizes that nothing but a reversal to medieval methods can help him and his followers in an intellectually indefensible position... In brief, we turn back the clock of history, but the smell of tortured, burning flesh, the shadows of the Dark Ages, hang about it still.\\"The American Spectator, August 1933, UNZ.org Staff Additions In 1933, American etiquette expert Amy Vanderbilt came on as business manager for the publication.Sam G. Riley, Biographical Dictionary of American Newspaper Columnists, Greenwood Press, 1995 In 1934 Dreiser urged Sherwood Anderson to join the editorial board of the paper, and Anderson accepted the offer despite the lack of pay. The position, Anderson wrote in a letter, \\"would give me an outlet and association with some very interesting men.\\" At one point Anderson's friends advised him to send a piece he wrote to the more prestigious publication The Atlantic, but he gave it to The American Spectator out of a sense of loyalty. Political Agenda As a member of the editorial board from November 1932 until February 1934, Theodore Dreiser sought to steer the paper towards a leftist agenda. Although he solicited contributions from Russian acquaintances, Marxist painter Diego Rivera, pro-labor journalist Bruce Crawford, and technocracy leader Howard Scott, Dreiser was mostly unsuccessful at turning the paper into a voice for the left political agenda. However, Dreiser did succeed at giving ink to issues such as railroad reform, birth control, and the criminal justice system.Jude Davies, Theodore Dreiser Political Writings, Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois, 2011 Dreiser's political agenda was stymied by his coeditors, namely Nathan and Boyd, who rejected many of his attempted contributions to the content of the paper. Theodore Dreiser wrote a letter to British Novelist John Cowper Powys on September 8, 1932, describing the purpose of The American Spectator, and invited him to submit work for publication. In November 1932, Dreiser again writes to Powys explaining that his co-editors would not allow him to publish his article.University of Virginia Library, A Guide to the Theodore Dreiser Collection, 1839-1944, University of Virginia Library, 2006 Dreiser was further irritated by his belief that Nathan and Boyd were averse to articles about social and economic issues. The conflict led to Dreiser's resignation in January 1934, and his name appeared in the masthead for the final time in February 1934. Founding Editors Depart The founding editors (minus Dreiser and plus Anderson) made good on their promise from the first issue to leave the paper once they no longer enjoyed the work. A February 28, 1935, article in the New York Times announced their intentions: \\"Following their pledge of thirty months ago that when they tired of editing The American Spectator they would \\"retire to their estates,\\" the editors announced yesterday the discontinuance of the periodical. The editors are George Jean Nathan, Ernest Boyd, Eugene O'Neill, James Branch Cabell and Sherwood Anderson.\\"\\"PERIODICAL HALTED BY 'TIRED' EDITORS; Nathan and Associates Drop The American Spectator to Retire to Their Estates,\\" New York Times, February 28, 1935 It was reported that the publication was turning a profit of $1,000 per month, but the enterprise had evolved into a \\"property\\" as opposed to a \\"diversion\\".American Spectator Pays, So Is Ended, Calgary Herald, February 28, 1935, p. 5 Charles Angoff served as editor from 1935‚Äì36, and John F.

It is in the gothic style and was designed by Charles Hanbury- Tracy, 1st Baron Sudeley for himself and built between 1819 and 1840. Upon completion, a volume on its architecture was published by John Britton (antiquary). It is a Grade I listed building. Hanbury-Tracy was a gentleman- architect who was influenced by the work of John Carter of the Society of Antiquaries. As one of the earliest Gothic Revival houses, the building shaped the course of British architectural history in an indirect way: when the Houses of Parliament were to be rebuilt after the fire in 1834, Hanbury-Tracy headed the jury to the competition, and the architect of the winning design, Charles Barry, obviously adapted his entry to the taste exemplified in Toddington.Schmidt, Leo: \\"Toddington Manor: The Genesis of a Gothic Revival Country House.\\" Construction Techniques in the Age of Historicism, Munich 2012: 34-45. The family owned the house until 1893 when Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 4th Baron Sudeley, and his writer wife Ada had to sell due to bankruptcy. Toddington Manor by Jan Kip, 1709, showing the remnant of its moat, its parish church and half-timbered outbuildings contrasting with its fine, brand-new formal garden The last private owner, a Mrs Andrews, died in 1935 and it stood empty until September 1939, when it was purchased by the National Union of Teachers, who had moved out of London to avoid air raids. The NUT staff both lived and worked in the building. Following Dunkirk a tented encampment was erected in the grounds and temporarily occupied by men evacuated from the beaches. They were later followed by units of the British Army. In 1942 the Pioneer Corps built a more permanent hutted encampment, which was occupied by units of the United States Army from October 1942. In August 1943 the NUT moved back to London and the US Army took over the house as well. After the war the Congregation of Christian Brothers rented the property and in 1948 the NUT sold it to them. In the late 1970s, it was converted into an international co-educational boarding school known as Toddington Manor College. Most of the students were from Asia, pursuing 'O' and 'A' level certification. In 2004, planning permission to convert it into a hotel was denied after the scheme had attracted considerable local opposition. In 2005 it was purchased by the artist Damien Hirst who plans to restore it and use it as a family home and a gallery, for both his own works and his collection of works by other artists. Since 2006, Toddington Manor has been encased in what Hirst claims is the world's biggest span of scaffolding.

Warden that Public Shelter Number 25 in the Southwestern Baghdad suburb of Amiriyah had become an alternative command post and showed no sign of being used as a civilian bomb shelter.

Glosson's comment was that the assessment wasn't \\"worth a shit.\\" A human source in Iraq, who had previously proven accurate warned the CIA that Iraqi intelligence had begun operating from the shelter. On February 11, the Amiriyah shelter was added to the Air Force's attack plan.

South of the station is a turning line for trains. History The √òstensj√∏ Line opened as a light rail on 18 December 1923. On 29 October 1967, the upgraded metro standard was first used, and the line was connected to the Oslo Metro. A month later, the extension to Skullerud opened. The work with building the extension between Skullerud and Mortensrud was originally planned to start in 1992, with completion planned for 1994. However, construction did not start until 1995. The extension is built to allow speeds of , and represents a considerable longer distance between stations than what is normal on the network. Most of the section is in tunnels, though there are also two viaducts. The extension (without the new station) cost NOK 215 million. The line runs somewhat south of the station, allowing space to line up trains, and for future further extension of the line. The station was taken into use on 24 November 1997, but not officially opened until 4 January 1998. On the day of the official opening, the bus terminal was taken into use. The station costs NOK 35 million. At the time, it was estimated to have about 6000 daily users‚Äîboth boarding and disembarking, including the bus terminal. Facilities The station is located in the residential area of Mortensrud, in S√∏ndre Nordstrand. Mortensrud is an open station without any barriers and free access from the bus stops. The station area is one storey below from the surrounding area. It has step-free access, and at the same level as the buses. Only the western portion of the two side platforms is in use, where direct connection can be made with buses. The station is located adjacent to the shopping center at Mortensrud. The station is designed by Arkitektskap. It is built in concrete, covered in red brick, steel, natural rock and wood, that will allow lianas to grow on them. The roofover the western platform is curved, and made of wood and glass. There is an underground parking lot in two levels. Service Mortensrud is served by line 3 on the √òstensj√∏ Line, operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter. The rapid transit serves the station every 15 minutes, except in the late evening and on weekend mornings, when there is a 30-minute headway. Travel time along the portion to Stortinget in the city center is 24 minutes. In 2001‚Äì02, the station had 2,077 daily boarding passengers.

It restored some elements of the Judiciary Act of 1801, which had been adopted by the Federalist majority in the previous Congress, but was repealed by the Democratic-Republican majority earlier in 1802. The 1802 Act effectively cancelled the 1801 Act's legally-called-for reduction in the size of the Supreme Court. The 1801 Act had provided that the Court's size would be reduced by one Justice to a court of five, by not filling its next future vacancy. Instead, the 1802 Act restored the Court's full-strength size to six members by referring to its then-present membership, which had been unchanged since the passage of the 1801 Act. This reaffirmed full-strength size of the Court as consisting of six Justices would not be changed again until the addition of a seventh seat by the Seventh Circuit Act of 1807: The Act restructured the circuit courts into six circuits, and assigned one Supreme Court justice to each circuit. Unlike the 1801 Act, no new circuit judgeships were created, so the justices were faced with having to return to the practice of \\"riding circuit\\" to hold court in each district within their circuit, along with the local district judge, during the majority of the year. No circuit courts were created for the judicial districts of Kentucky, Tennessee, Maine, or the territories, although the 1801 Act would have done so. Since the circuit courts were now to consist of only two judges, the Act permitted them to certify to the Supreme Court any question of law on which the two could not agree. Also, the district judge was not permitted to hear appeals of his own decisions, so appeals from the district courts were decided by the circuit justice alone. But the most important part of the Act was the provision that a quorum of only one judge was needed to convene a circuit court. As a result, Supreme Court justices could often rely on district court judges to convene circuit courts. With circuit riding largely optional, Supreme Court justices were no longer saddled with what they had previously felt was a tremendous burden. The Act's flexibility proved crucial to the demise of circuit riding, which essentially disappeared by 1840. The Act also created additional district courts by dividing the District of North Carolina into the districts of Albemarle, Cape Fear, and Pamptico, and by dividing the District of Tennessee into the Eastern and Western Districts of Tennessee. No new judgeships were created for these courts; however, the district judges in North Carolina and Tennessee had to hold court in each district within their state, and the North Carolina judge also had to sit on the circuit court (which, however, continued to sit for the state as a whole, not in the separate district court districts). The Act established a United States District Court for the District of Columbia, although this court is not the direct predecessor of today's court bearing the same name. The Act also moved the dates of the Supreme Court term from the two months of June and December to the month of February. This effectively cancelled the Supreme Court term in 1802, since the Act was enacted in April, after the 1802 term was set to end in February.

After attending the classical schools of Marienwerder and K√∂nigsberg, he learned farming on an estate near Thorn, and in 1821 entered the University of Breslau as a student of philosophy. But he soon abandoned an academic career and, after returning for a while to country life, retired to the small town of Gollub, where he devoted himself to literary studies. In 1847 he settled at Thorn, the home of Copernicus, where he died. Endnote: *O. Roquette, Siebzig Jahre, i. (1894). Writings Goltz is best known to literary fame by his Buch der Kindheit (\\"Book of Childhood\\", Frankfurt, 1847; 4th ed., Berlin, 1877), in which, after the style of Jean Paul and Adalbert Stifter, but with a more modern realism, he gives a charming and idyllic description of the impressions of his own childhood.

It was Pontiac's top trim package on the Pontiac Chieftain, with later generations built on longer wheelbases, and serving as the foundation platform for the Pontiac Bonneville. The car was easily identified by its chrome star trim along its sides, a feature all Star Chiefs were equipped with. __TOC__ First generation (1954) Between 1954 and 1957, the Star Chief was Pontiac's prestige model and was based on the Pontiac Chieftain. When the storyline of I Love Lucy pointed towards a Hollywood setting in the 1954-1955 season, the characters drove (in episode 110, \\"California Here We Come\\") to the West Coast in a 1955 Star Chief convertible, that in the previous episode \\"Lucy Learns to Drive\\" was \\"bumped together\\" with a 1922 Cadillac Type V-63.1922 Cadillac Lucille Ball In 1954, Pontiac also introduced air conditioning with all the components under the hood, a first for the price range. Seat belts were added as options in 1956. The Star Chief was available in Deluxe and pricier Custom trim, with the top trim level hardtop called the Catalina. Prior to the introduction of the Star Chief, all Pontiacs had shared the modest wheelbase of the Chevrolet since the beginning of Pontiac. The introduction of this new premier model in 1954 was the first application of the longer 123.5 inch (313.7 cm) wheelbase of the junior Oldsmobiles and Buicks to the Pontiac division. The car was still on the A platform, but with added towards the rear of the frame. Power the first year came from Pontiac's venerable straight eight engine, with the six- cylinder not available. 1954 Star Chief sedan Second generation (1955-1957) Along with an all-new body, the straight-eight was superseded by the new V-8 power in 1955.Gunnell and Kowalke, p. 64 Typical for the 1955 Pontiacs is the design with two wide \\"Silver Streaks\\" running the length of the hood. The hood ornament ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù was amber plastic that lit up when the headlights were turned on. Also for 1955, the new Star Chief Safari two door hardtop wagon, which was similar to Chevrolet's Bel Air Nomad, was introduced, shared with the Pontiac Chieftain. This variant lasted through 1957; after that the Safari name was used for all of the division's standard four door wagons. The Safari was introduced on January 31, 1955, over three months behind the rest of the 1955s. The Safari was not quite part of the Star Chief line, as it sat on the shorter Chieftain wheelbase. It was officially part of the \\"27 series\\", whereas the longer Star Chief received the \\"28 series\\" designation. In January 1957, some time after the rest of the new models, the four-door \\"Custom Safari Transcontinental\\" was introduced.Gunnell and Kowalke, pp. 67-68 For 1956 the design was lightly revised, with heavier looking bumpers and a vertical slash on the front door above the swage line. In 1957, the high performance Star Chief Custom Bonneville was introduced as part of its divisional head's push to raise the marque out of the doldrums. The silver streaks running down the hood were dropped for the new \\"Star Flight\\" design. All gauges were placed in an oval on the dash and the side trim had a missile- shaped spear behind the front door. 1955 Pontiac Starchief (15041199863).jpg1955 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Catalina 1956 Pontiac Star Chief 2 door Hardtop (8357640809).jpg1956 Pontiac Star Chief Pontiac Star Chief 1957 4.jpg1957 Pontiac Star Chief Third generation (1958) In 1958, the Bonneville was first given its own position in the Pontiac lineup as the ultimate Pontiac, and was only available as a two-door hardtop and two-door convertible. While no longer Pontiac's prestige model, the Star Chief remained a well-appointed car, and the division's finest four door hardtops and sedans. The 1958 Star Chief, as with the rest of the Pontiac lineup, received all-new bodywork and an updated chassis. The body was considerably longer and lower, and featured a new honeycomb grille design and twin headlamps.Gunnell and Kowalke, p. 70 The sedans and coup√© models all shared the longer 124 inch wheelbase, while the Custom Safari model remained on a chassis two inches shorter, shared with the lesser Chieftain. In spite of the new bodywork, sales of the 1958 Star Chief dropped precipitously; down by around 60% while Pontiac's overall sales dropped by more than a third. 1958 Star Chief Custom Safari (model 2793 SD) The engine was updated from the unit used in 1957 to a slightly bored out version. Power only increased marginally, to for the manual version, while the most powerful \\"PM\\" option was now up to .Gunnell and Kowalke, p. 72 Fourth generation (1959-1960) In 1959, when the Bonneville gained a full range of body styles, the Star Chief was limited to sedans and hardtops, while the Bonneville and the new Catalina models received the lion's share of Pontiac's attention in the marketplace. In 1959, the Star Chief made 17.97% of Pontiac sales. This was also the first year of the \\"wide-track\\" Pontiacs. In 1960, the new Ventura was introduced, and the Star Chief was thereafter limited to four door sedans and hardtops. This was a novel, but unsuccessful approach. The Star Chief was equipped and powered in a manner similar to the lower-priced, slightly smaller Catalina series. The Ventura was more lavishly equipped in the manner of the high-line Bonneville, but was available with only two doors and rode the Catalina's slightly shorter wheelbase. This gave sedan buyers of modest means a larger choice than Catalina for only slightly more money, and gave upscale coupe buyers a lighter, sprightlier alternative to the big Bonneville. The Ventura lasted only through 1961, and was replaced by the even sportier new Grand Prix. The Star Chief continued to be available only with four doors through the end of production. Compared to the Catalina, the Star Chief was equipped only very slightly more lavishly; the major additional interior feature was the electric clock. 1960 Pontiac Star Chief Sedan Fifth generation (1961-1964) For 1962, Pontiac offered a Super Duty V8 with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at , as a US$2,250 option (when the base Star Chief listed at US$3,097).Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960-1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), pp.191 & 193. A rare option, it was probably never ordered on this somewhat heavy sedan. As in the other Pontiac series, the 4-door hardtop was designated the Star Chief Vista. Bonneville taillights and the three chrome stars on each side continued to distinguish the car from the Catalina. The stars were located either on the roof or rear fender, depending on year. No wagons were offered. All Safari wagons during this period (including the Bonneville Safari) rode the four and a half inch shorter wheelbase shared by Chevrolet and Catalina. This made a Star Chief Safari too redundant to bother with. File:1962 Pontiac Star Chief (27508494900).jpg1962 Pontiac Star Chief 4-door Sedan File:1963 Pontiac Star Chief (19046151442).jpg1963 Pontiac Star Chief 4 Door Sedan File:Classic Days 2019, Berlin (CDB90020).jpg1964 Pontiac Star Chief 4 Door Sedan Sixth generation (1965-1966) For 1966, the car was renamed the Star Chief Executive as the first step towards retiring the name, which by the mid-1960s had become dated. For 1967, Pontiac dropped the Star Chief name for United States sales and renamed the mid-priced model the Executive. In Canada, Pontiac models used Chevrolet drivelines for greater economy. To ensure that used car buyers in the U.S. were not sold less expensive Canadian models, different series names were used. The Canadian equivalent to the Star Chief was called Laurentian. Nonetheless, Pontiac offered a similarly-named series called the Strato Chief, but this model was the lowest-priced big Canadian Pontiac.

It has defined itself as a \\"non-party, non-sectarian political club\\" and, whilst forging alliances with different groups, has eschewed close links with other extremist political parties.Michael Billig, A Social Psychological View of the National Front, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978, p. 101 History A flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement The League was formed around 1974 as a political club by Keith Thompson and Mike Griffin as a breakaway from the Action Party, founded by British fascist Oswald Mosley. The League sought to continue what it saw as a purer form of the ideas of Mosley than those offered by then leader Jeffrey Hamm.Ray Hill & Andrew Bell, The Other Face of Terror, London: Grafton, 1988, p. 184. In the 1970s the League became a political home for the more intellectual adherents of \\"Neo-Nazi\\" ideology, particularly those who wanted a united Europe with a European-derived population, a continuation of Mosley's Europe a Nation policy. Alongside this the League also followed Mosley's lead in endorsing Irish republicanism, something of a change from their contemporaries in the British far right who reserved their support for Ulster loyalism.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 185. The League was never intended to be a political party, but more of a social, intellectual, and cultural organization, albeit with the ultimate political aim of promoting European people and their culture. Intended as an exclusive club for what were seen as the leading minds on the British far right, its membership tended to be restricted to around 50-100 members.Glyn Ford, European Parliament Committee of Inquiry on Racism and Xenophobia - Report on the Findings of the Inquiry, 2.12.27 Indeed, membership of the League was restricted to those invited to join only.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 185 The group often had a torrid relationship with the far right parties, and indeed the National Front barred its members from joining the League in 1977.S. Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 100. Around this time Spearhead even included articles claiming that the League was in fact a cult dominated by clandestine leaders, secret oaths and profane initiation ceremonies.Billig, Fascists, p. 117 Nonetheless individual members maintained ties to both organisations, with some contributing to both Spearhead and The League Review.Billig, Fascists, pp. 117-118 Similarly the British Movement, which had originally co-operated with the League, eventually severed its ties over the Northern Irish issue.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p. 177 The Enemy Within is an account of the League of St George written by a former member, the cartoonist Robert Edwards, who founded the pro-Mosley European Action UK pressure group in 2005.http://www.oswaldmosley.net/ International contacts Adopting the emblem of the Arrow Cross, the League sought to forge links with like-minded groups in Europe, and took part in international neo-Nazi rallies at Diksmuide in Belgium, where it forged links with the Vlaamse Militanten Orde and the National States' Rights Party.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 195-6. Eschewing the route of electoral politics, the League instead sought to set itself up as an umbrella group for National Socialists of any affiliation, although the League did work closely with first the British Movement and then the British National Party when it was founded (with Thompson and John Graeme Wood attending the party's inaugural meeting while claiming to speak for the League).Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 165-6. Steve Brady, a former activist in the short-lived National Party (and who retained close links to the Ulster Defence Association despite the League's avowed support for Irish republicanism), was appointed International Liaison Officer in 1978 and helped to oversee the development of links with groups internationally such as the Faisceaux Nationalistes Europ√©ens of France, founded by Mark Fredriksen, and Italy's Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR).Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 185-9. Brady also wrote a column in League Review, under the nom-de-plume Heimdall. The group also gained support in South Africa amongst some leading supporters of the Herstigte Nasionale Party who were responsible for funding the League during the early 1980s.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 255-6. 'Safehousing' The League went into hiatus in the early 1980s after an episode of ITV current affairs show World in Action exposed its attempts to set up safe houses for suspected Italian terrorists,A Century of British Fascism based on information given by Ray Hill, who had been active in the League. Subsequent activities Following these revelations the group became less active, but did not close down altogether. Its magazine, The National Review, received some attention in far- right circles in 1986 when Colin Jordan published an article calling for the development of an underground struggle.Ford, European Parliament Committee of Inquiry on Racism and Xenophobia - Report on the Findings of the Inquiry, 2.12.25 This article was credited with attempts to revive the British Movement and to set up other groups to carry out Jordan's ideas.Ford, European Parliament Committee of Inquiry on Racism and Xenophobia - Report on the Findings of the Inquiry, 2.12.26 In 1996 it was alleged in Searchlight that members of the League had recruited mercenaries for a mission in South Africa organised by Constand Viljoen with the aim of assassinating the country's leaders and damaging its infrastructure. Ultimately the plan was foiled by the South African secret service and by a change in strategy by Viljoen, who abandoned his Afrikaner Volksfront in order to lead the Freedom Front.'South Africa' It continues to exist under other leadership to this day. Previously publishing a regular monthly magazine, The League Review, which had a comparatively wide European readership, it now publishes a quarterly journal, The League Sentinel.http://www.leaguestgeorge.org/sentinel.htm The group was featured in Bill Buford's Among the Thugs where the author commented to a member that his ideas of leaving urban life and returning to the soil recalled those of the Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.Review of 'Among the Thugs' Members Leading members of the League have included Dagenham-based John Harrison, millionaire Robin Rushton, former Mosley's Union Movement member and speaker Keith Thompson, Mike Griffin, and Roger Clare, who has also been active in South Africa and New Zealand.Fascism Today - Groups in Britain from Bernard O'Mahoney's site Ian Souter Clarence, the former head of Column 88, was a member,Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 198. while both publisher Anthony Hancock and National Front and National Party veteran Denis Pirie were also closely associated with the group.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 205-6.

It is one of the two feast days which is held as a strict fast. The other is the commemoration of the Beheading of John the Forerunner on August 29.  Date  The feast is nominally celebrated on September 14. Thus Orthodox churches following the Revised Julian calendar celebrate it on the civil date of September 14: Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Poland, Czechia and Slovakia, Albania, the Estonia, and most of the Orthodox Church in America. Those following the Julian calendar celebrate it on civil September 27: Jerusalem, Russia, Serbia, North Macedonia, Georgia, Ukraine, Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), and Mount Athos.  Origin  According to Orthodox Church teachings, Saint Helen, the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great, discovered the Holy Cross on 14 September 325 AD in the vicinity of Golgotha, where it lay buried in the dust of the centuries. On the spot where the Cross was discovered, there was also found a hitherto unknown flower of rare beauty and fragrance, which has been named Vasiliko (Basil), meaning the flower of royalty, out of respect for the Dowager Queen who led the expedition. For the next three hundred years, the Cross stayed in the possession of the Christians in Jerusalem, but the city was captured by the Persians in 614 AD and the Cross fell into their hands. It was later recovered by the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire (or Byzantine Empire).  Name day  The feast of the Elevation of the Holy Cross is celebrated as the name day of persons named Stavros (Œ£œÑŒ±œçœÅŒøœÇ) or Stavroula (Œ£œÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœçŒªŒ±); this includes those using the English nickname Steve (derived from Greek Œ£œÑŒ≠œÜŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ Stephanos/Stephen) for Stavros.

The newspaper is distributed in the northern, northwestern and western suburbs of Chicago. It is the namesake of the Daily Herald Media Group, and through it is the leading subsidiary of Paddock Publications. The paper started in 1871 and was independently owned and run by four generations of the Paddock family. In 2018, the Paddock family sold its stake in the paper to its employees through an employee stock ownership plan.https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20181206/after-120-years-paddock-family- sells-stake-in-daily-herald-to-employees The paper's longtime slogan has been \\"To fear God, tell the truth, and make money.\\" Areas of circulation The Daily Herald serves Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, and McHenry counties and has a coverage area of about . It is the third-largest newspaper in Illinois (behind the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times). History The Daily Herald was founded in 1872 as the Cook County Herald. It was initially tailored to the business needs of the then-rural northwestern portion of Cook County. Hosea C. Paddock, a former teacher, bought the newspaper in 1889 for $175. His sons, Stuart and Charles, took over the paper in 1920 and renamed it the Arlington Heights Herald in 1926. For its first century, it was a weekly publication. In 1898, Hosea Paddock bought the Palatine Enterprise. Over the years, the Paddocks bought newspapers in Mount Prospect, Bensenville, Roselle and Wheeling. The Daily Herald counts 1898 as its founding date. The paper grew along with northwestern Cook County after World War II, as four-lane highways and the expansion of the Chicago & North Western's commuter rail line in the northwest suburbs (now the Union Pacific/Northwest Line) turned it into a suburban area. It became a tri-weekly in 1967. The paper's real growth began in 1968, when Stuart Paddock, Jr. took over the paper. A year later, the paper began publishing five days a week. This move came almost out of necessity; Field Communications, publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times, had introduced its \\"Daily\\" papers for the northern suburbs in 1966. A brutal one-year circulation war ensued, ending in 1970 when Field pulled out of the area. That year, the paper dropped Arlington Heights from its masthead after merging with its sister publications and expanding into Lake County. It began publishing on Saturdays in 1975. It became the Daily Herald in 1977 and began publishing on Sundays in 1978. During the second half of the 1980s, it expanded into DuPage, Kane and McHenry counties. Its growth has continued to this day. Stuart Paddock, Jr. died in 2002.Hepp, Rick (April 16, 2002). \\"Stuart R. Paddock Jr., 86\\". Chicago Tribune. Today, the Daily Heralds motto is, \\"Big Picture, Local Focus\\" because it covers both international and national news as well as news local to its circulation area. The Daily Herald was made partially employee- owned in 1972, but the Paddock family transferred their interest to the paper's employee stock ownership plan in 2018 as part of their effort to ensure the paper remains locally owned.

He is the vocalist for the punk band T.S.O.L. (True Sounds of Liberty), which emerged from the late 1970s Los Angeles hardcore punk rock scene, along with Black Flag, Circle Jerks and Bad Religion. Grisham has also fronted the bands Vicious Circle, the Joykiller, Tender Fury and Cathedral of Tears. He records with T.S.O.L., the Joykiller and the Manic Low.  Biography  = Early life = Jack Grisham was born in Hayward, California, United States, and then moved to Long Beach. Grisham's father, a career military man with 30 years in the Navy and Coast Guard, died in 1984. Grisham's mother was a military housewife. Grisham was one of five children and has an older sister, two older brothers, and a younger sister. Grisham's older sister was part of the hippie subculture (or as he calls it, \\"Late 60's protest crap\\"). As a result, by the time he was six years old, Grisham was reading publications like Fritz the Cat and Zap Comix, and listening to albums by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, the Beach Boys, the Ventures, etc. Grisham cites the albums We're Only in it for the Money and Let it Bleed as two of his musical influences. In his early life, Grisham's family moved back to Long Beach, California. Growing up, he was a rebellious youth heavily into surfing, skateboarding, and in his words \\"causing trouble.\\" While in high school, he met future T.S.O.L. drummer Todd Barnes through a girlfriend. Grisham and Barnes became friends, and took off with the girlfriend's guitar and amplifier and began playing around with sounds. In the beginning, Grisham claims, \\"All we did was make a bunch of noise and yell, \\"Fuck the neighbors\\" all day.\\" =Adult life= While in his teens, Grisham started experimenting with mood altering substances. Soon he became addicted to drugs and alcohol. He recalled, \\"I was a nut. I used to think I didn't have a problem because I didn't shoot up and I didn't take acid.\\" After several minor tangles with the law stemming from his drug and alcohol abuse, Grisham married a 16-year-old girl in Mexico, which he claims got him on the road to sobriety. When asked how he got sober in a 2008 interview, Grisham said, \\"Actually, I married an underage girl. I wanted her to get clean. I said I would support her. I was like, \\"Hey, I'll support you so you can get help. I'll go to the meetings too. Then she ended up leaving and I ended up staying.\\" Grisham has been sober since January 1989. He has two daughters, Anastasia and Georgia, and resides in Huntington Beach, California with his wife Robin and her/their three children, Dexy, MacGowan and Avalon. When not working on a music project, Grisham writes and practices hypnotherapy. =Vicious Circle= In 1978, Grisham began rehearsing as lead vocalist with future Joneses/The Klan/A.K.A. guitarist Steve Houston (a.k.a. Steve Dead) to form Vicious Circle with bassist Laddy Tirrell and future T.S.O.L. drummer Todd Barnes. Vicious Circle quickly got a following within the beach cities and Los Angeles punk rock scene. Vicious Circle was notorious for Ultra-violence at shows in the early days of punk rock. Grisham is later quoted as saying \\"Whatever the logic, the Vicious Circle was a maniac attractor.\\" *A recording of Vicious Circle was made in 1978 consisting of 2 separate practice tapes and ultimately released in 2013 by TKO Records as an E.P. record of (200) copies on white vinyl with blue spatter. =True Sounds of Liberty (T.S.O.L.)= Childhood friends Grisham and Barnes were joined by Ron Emory and Mike Roche to form T.S.O.L. The original line-up of the band was Grisham on vocals, Ron Emory on guitars, Mike Roche on bass, and Todd Barnes on drums. T.S.O.L.'s initial line-up gained fans from the hardcore punk, art punk, death punk, deathrock, horror punk, and goth genres. During his time with T.S.O.L., the band was notorious for their controversial, transgressive, and political lyrics. Jack Grisham brought a darker fashion and sound deathrock to the highly political punk rock scene in Southern California, in particular, Long Beach, California painting his face white, dressing in all- black goth clothes and doing photo-shoots in cemetery locations in the dead of night. The True Sounds Of Liberty were among the first waves of Southern California bands which embarked upon Nationwide tours performing \\"punk rock\\" and \\"death rock\\" music in 1982 and also 1983 along with contemporaries such as Black Flag and the Circle Jerks which embraced D.I.Y. ethos of the early punk rock scene self-financing their concert tours with little to no outside assistance from the record industry. The original T.S.O.L. broke up on January 9, 1983, following the infamous S.I.R. Studios \\"Sunset Strip\\" Riot at a headlining T.S.O.L. show featuring Redd Kross, Social Distortion, Los Olvidados. The space was filled to capacity with fans and punks alike outside the venue when violence ensued. Grisham walked away from the band and violence, which was reaching unprecedented levels. Ron Emory and Mike Roche enlisted vocalist Joe Wood, Grisham's brother-in-law at the time to fill the void left by his absence and drummer Mitch Dean for departing drummer Todd Barnes. They played music that started as punk rock, but, with each new album changed to blues-inspired (hair metal). They spent several years touring and recording under the name T.S.O.L. The original T.S.O.L. reformed in 1989, but Todd Barnes died of a brain aneurysm in 1999. T.S.O.L. has been touring and recording steadily since 1999. =The Joykiller= Grisham and Ron Emory formed The Joykiller in 1995 along with Billy Persons (The Weirdos/Gun Club) on bass, Ronnie King on keyboards, and Chris Lagerborg on drums. The Joykiller released three albums on Epitaph records prior to disbanding in 1998 and had a minor radio hit in the Netherlands with the song \\"Go-Bang.\\" They later released their Greatest Non-Hits in 2003. =The Manic Low= In the fall of 2011, Grisham launched into another musical endeavor with his band \\"the Manic Low\\". Their debut album, Songs For An Up Day, was released on Moonlight Graham Records in June 2012. =Jack Grisham's Lost Soul= In 2012, Grisham formed a new band called Jack Grisham's Lost Soul, to play gigs covering T.S.O.L. and the Joykiller songs. Grisham is lead vocalist; T.S.O.L.'s Anthony \\"Tiny\\" Biuso is on drums; on guitar, D.I.'s lead, Clinton Calton; on bass, Trevor Lucca; and on keyboards, Greg Kuehn. =Film= Grisham appeared as himself in the movies American Hardcore and the Geza X film Rage: 20 Years of Punk Rock West Coast Style (2001)(he also wrote the title track \\"Spit Up the Rage\\"). In the 1984 Penelope Spheeris film Suburbia, he appeared with T.S.O.L. performing \\"Wash Away\\" and \\"Darker My Love.\\" =Politics= In the early years of T.S.O.L., Grisham was an outspoken anarchist, and his lyrics were often highly critical of the government. Songs such as \\"Abolish Government/Silent Majority,\\" \\"Peace Thru Power,\\" and \\"Property Is Theft\\" were standard in T.S.O.L.'s song sets. Grisham later changed his anti-government stance, stating, \\"What I realized about anarchy is that we are not responsible enough to be anarchist. There's no way possible. We're not responsible enough to be that. That's a heavy concept.\\" Grisham was one of 135 candidates who ran for governor in the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, receiving 2,200 votes. He ran on a social democratic platform as incumbent Democratic governor Gray Davis was recalled. During his campaign, he stressed health care and education, and supported the teaching in school of religious tolerance. A historic concert event featuring The Adolescents, T.S.O.L., Youth Brigade and more was cast in an effort to raise awareness to the campaign on Sunday, October 5, 2003 at the Henry Fonda theater in Los Angeles, California =Writing= In 2011, Grisham released his first novel An American Demon: A Memoir. This book has received favorable reviews by several sources. In August 2015 Grisham released A Principle of Recovery: An Unconventional Journey Through the Twelve Steps, a book that walks you through the twelve steps of recovery(AA) from Grisham's perspective as a long time member of Alcoholics Anonymous. Grisham is currently working on an illustrated book of short stories.

In 2006, the Bush administration sought over $100 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region, making the storm the costliest natural disaster in US history.St. Onge, Jeff; Epstein, Victor. \\"Ex-chief says FEMA readiness even worse.\\" Boston.com. May 1, 2006. This does not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply and exports of commodities such as cotton. Before Hurricane Katrina, the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs, with 600,000 of them in New Orleans. One study, by Mark Burton and Michael J. Hicks, estimated the total economic impact to Louisiana and Mississippi may exceed $150 billion.Burton, Mark L.; Michael J. Hicks. \\"Hurricane Katrina: Preliminary Estimates of Commercial and Public Sector Damages .\\" Marshall University: Center for Business and Economic Research. September, 2005. Hundreds of thousands of residents of southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including nearly everyone who lived in New Orleans, were left unemployed. No paychecks were being cashed and no money was being spent, and therefore no taxes were being collected by local governments. The lack of revenue will limit the resources of the affected communities and states for years to come. Before the storm, the region was already one of the poorest in America with one of the highest unemployment rates. There was also some concern when, on September 8, 2005, President Bush temporarily suspended the Davis-Bacon Act in the affected areas, which allowed for contractors working on Federal construction projects to be paid less than the prevailing local wage.Bush, George W. \\"Proclamation by the President: To Suspend Subchapter IV of Chapter 31 of Title 40, United States Code, Within a Limited Geographic Area in Response to the National Emergency Caused by Hurricane Katrina.\\" White House. September 8, 2005. The concerns over these actions were primarily that allowing the government to pay less than the prevailing wage would contribute to increased poverty in the region, which already ranked among the lowest in the nation in terms of household income.\\"U.S. Census Data: Three-Year-Average Median Household Income by State: 2000‚Äì2002 .\\" U.S. Census Bureau. The act was later reinstated on October 26, 2005, amid political pressure from both Democrats and Republicans in the United States Congress. Oil production Sign showing gas prices in front of Sheetz in Mount Jackson, Virginia, on August 31, 2005, just as Hurricane Katrina began to make its mark on the price of gasoline. Prices had risen thirty cents since the previous day, and would rise an additional twenty cents before the day was over. The storm interrupted oil production, importation, and refining in the Gulf eden, thus having a major effect on fuel prices. Before the storm, one- tenth of all the crude oil consumed in the United States and almost half of the gasoline produced in the country came from refineries in the states along the Gulf's shores. An additional 24% of the natural gas supply is extracted or imported in the region. Furthermore, the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve is also stored in this region. Power outages in the wake of Katrina have also caused distribution problems for oil and natural gas. Pipelines which move petroleum products from places like Houston to areas of the east coast have had their flows interrupted because power outages shut down the pumps that kept materials flowing. Dick Cheney personally called the manager of the Southern Pines Electric Power Association on the night of August 30 and again the next morning and ordered him to divert power crews to substations in nearby Collins that were essential to the operation of the Colonial Pipeline, which carries gasoline and diesel fuel from Texas to the Northeast.Maute, Nikki D. \\"Power crews diverted: Restoring pipeline came first.\\" Hattiesburg American. September 11, 2005. At least twenty offshore oil platforms were missing, sunk, or had gone adrift, according to the United States Coast Guard. One oil rig, in dock for repairs before the storm, broke loose and hit the Cochrane/Africatown USA road bridge over the Mobile River in Mobile, Alabama. Two others went adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, but they were recovered. One platform, originally located 12 mi (20 km) off the Louisiana coast, has washed up onshore at Dauphin Island, Alabama. Shell Oil Company's MARS platform, producing around per day, was also severely damaged. At 7:03 a.m. CDT on August 29, Ted Falgout, Port Director of Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a key oil and gas hub 60 mi (100 km) south of New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico, reported that the port had taken a direct hit from the hurricane. The port services approximately 16% of the nation's supply of crude oil and natural gas.Press Release. \\"FHWA Issues Record of Decision on LA 1 Improvements.\\" Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. January 31, 2003. According to Falgout, Hurricane Katrina, \\"will impact oil and gas infrastructure, not just short term but long term as well. The impact of the storm -- the Gulf is shut down; all of the area of the storm is shut down; a half billion dollars a day of oil and gas is unavailable.\\" Port Fourchon takes direct hit from Katrina (7 a.m. CDT,29 August 2005) The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, which imports 11% of all U.S. oil consumption, closed on August 27, and Shell reported a reduction in production of .Laverty, Gene. \\"Oil, Gas May Soar as Storm Shuts U.S. Gulf Production .\\" Bloomberg. August 28, 2005. The port was undamaged by the storm and resumed operation within hours of getting power back. Due to fears that the production of oil in the United States will be cut by up to one-third of normal capacity, the price of oil fluctuated greatly. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures reached a record high of over $70 per barrel ($0.44/L). There were many reports to Louisiana authorities and elsewhere of price gouging, not only for gasoline, but also for other needed items such as bottled water. In some areas, gasoline was being sold for as much as $6 per gallon ($1.59 per liter). One BP station in Stockbridge, Georgia, south of Atlanta, was selling gas at $5.87 per gallon ($1.55 per liter) less than a day after Katrina hit. Just before the storm, average fuel prices were approximately $2.50 per US gallon ($0.66/L). International oil prices also rose. In the United Kingdom, pump prices for unleaded petrol (gas) hit ¬£1 per litre ($7 per U.S. gallon) for the first time in a significant number of places (averaging about 95p), a rise of about 3% from pre-Katrina prices. Wholesale prices were up 5% by September 6.Staff Writer. \\"UK petrol prices continue to rise.\\" BBC News. September 5, 2005. Long lines developed at some gas stations throughout the U.S. as customers rushed to buy gasoline, anticipating price increases in the wake of the storm. Emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and in light of similar incidents in his own state, Governor Mike Easley of North Carolina has issued a statement asking all North Carolinians to conserve gas, limit fuel consumption and non- essential road trips, and for state employees to car pool.Staff Writer. \\"Gov. Mike Easley Statement On N.C. Gasoline Supply .\\" WRAL-TV. On the day of the Governor's announcement, many gas stations around the state ran out of gas and lines were formed at others. By 12:00 p.m. CDT on August 31, eight Gulf of Mexico refineries remained shut down and one was operating at reduced capacity. Evaluation of five of the eight refineries was delayed due to limited access. Aside from the problems involved in restarting the refineries (which is a lengthy process) there were additional major issues with worker housing, since a large proportion of homes were destroyed by the hurricane. The Environmental Protection Agency moved to reduce prices by temporarily lifting fuel standards in America until September 15. Some crude oil was also released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as well, to combat prices as major economic consequences were predicted if prices remained high for a long period of time -- leading consumer spending to drop and causing many foreign economies, especially in Asia, to suffer. President Bush also temporarily waived the Jones Act, allowing foreign oil companies to ship oil between ports of the United States. By September 7, Gulf oil production had returned to 42% of normal. Of 10 refineries that were shut down by Katrina, four were expected to be back at full capacity within a week, however another four could be out of commission for months. Gambling and entertainment Katrina forced many casinos along the Mississippi Gulf Coast to close and evacuate. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino was scheduled to open the first week of September, but did not open until June 30, 2007. The Beau Rivage was severely damaged by water that reached the third floor, but seems to have suffered the least damage of the beachfront casinos. Grand Casino Biloxi had its mammoth gaming barge blown across U.S. 90. Treasure Bay's pirate ship was heavily damaged and washed ashore, it was subsequently dismantled down to the underlying barge. The President Casino Biloxi was washed across U.S. 90 and landed on top of a Holiday Inn, nearly a mile (1.6 km) from the casino's berth. In Gulfport, the western Grand Casino Gulfport barge, containing Kid's Quest, washed across U.S. 90 and was left blocking the highway. The Copa Casino barge was pushed onto land next to the Grand Casino Gulfport's parking garage. Casino Magic and Isle of Capri in Biloxi both suffered heavy damage to their gaming barges, likely beyond repair. Before the storm, at least 14,000 people were employed at Gulf Coast casinos. Harrah's New Orleans closed shortly before the storm and sustained storm damage. The building was also used by first responders as a base of operations in the days following the storm. The casino reopened on February 17, 2006, just in time for Mardi Gras,Press Release. \\"Harrah's New Orleans Re-Opens Friday, February 17, as the fun and excitement of Mardi Gras Begin.\\" Harrah's Entertainment.

September 21, 2005. Mississippi will lose approximately $500,000 in tax revenue for each day that the Biloxi-area riverboat casinos are closed, and about $140,000 per day for the South River region casinos. As a comparison, in 2004, Mississippi earned $2.7 billion in casino revenues, third behind Nevada and New Jersey ($10.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively). Katrina was directly related to the controversial National Basketball Association Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City. New Orleans' NBA franchise was forced to move temporarily; the Hornets (now known as the Pelicans after Saints owner Tom Benson purchased the team in 2013) chose a mix of the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge, and the Ford Center in Oklahoma City while New Orleans Arena was being rebuilt. The success of the Hornets in the Ford Center (which the Hornets had a deal where the team would split its games for two years) directly led to Oklahoma City interests purchasing the Seattle SuperSonics, which was for sale, and move to become the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008. Agriculture and forestry According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the national impact of Hurricane Katrina on Gulf Coast crops was minimal, with most of the damage borne by minor producers of major crops (corn, soybeans, and cotton).Staff Writer. \\"Impact on US crops from hurricane minimal, says USDA.\\" ABC. September 13, 2005. The main impact of the storm on agriculture is likely to involve ocean shipping and exports. In 2004, 22% of U.S. wheat exports, 71% of corn exports, and 65% of soybean exports passed through Gulf ports. Shipping did not occur until later in the fall, when ports would again be operational.Samuelson, Robert J. \\"Hitting the Economy.\\" MSNBC. September 12, 2005. In addition to the 50 Mississippi counties covered by the Presidential primary natural disaster designation, the USDA declared an additional 31 counties as primary agricultural disaster areas.

The greatest damage occurred from the coastal counties northward to Laurel, with heavy damage to pine forests in Hancock, Harrison, and Pearl River countries. An estimated 14.6 million cords (52,900,000 m¬≥) of paperwood and 3.2 billion board feet (7,600,000 m¬≥) of sawtimber were destroyed. The estimated economic impact of this loss was $1.3 billion. Additionally, there was an estimated $1.1 billion in damage to urban trees in 181 Mississippi communities.Grizzard, Kent. \\"Forestry Commission Reports $2.4 billion of Tree Damage .\\" Mississippi Forestry Commission.

The company cited lower revenue and storm restoration costs as the primary cause. Parent company Entergy Corporation promptly arranged $100 million in financing. Insurance Response The Insurance Information Institute reports that Hurricane Katrina was the costliest disaster in the history of insurance. It said that the insurance industry paid $41.1 billion ($45.1 billion in 2009 dollars) and more than 1.7 million claims ‚Äì across six states. Some 15,000 claims adjusters from across the country were called in to handle the record number of claims for damage to homes, businesses and vehicles. Louisiana accounted for 63 percent of insured losses and Mississippi accounted for one-third. In addition, the federal government-operated National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) paid out $16.1 billion in claims from flooding. Damage from flooding, including storm surge from a hurricane, is covered by the NFIP, but is not covered under standard homeowners insurance policies. The Institute also said another $2 billion to $3 billion of insured damages occurred at off-shore energy facilities.Insurance Information Institute Issues Update, Catastrophes: Insurance Issues. \\".\\" See also *Damage to infrastructure by Hurricane Katrina *Economic impact analysis *Hurricane Katrina effects by region *Oil price increases since 2003 References Category:Effects of Hurricane Katrina Katrina effects economic ","title":"Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina"},{"id":"2598371","text":"\\"You Can't Be True, Dear\\" is a popular German song. History It was originally written as a German language song, \\"Du Kannst Nicht Treu Sein,\\" by composer Hans Otten and lyricist Gerhard Ebeler. English language lyrics and title were written by Hal Cotten. In 1948, Ken Griffin recorded the song, first released as an instrumental and later with vocalist Jerry Wayne dubbing the lyrics, both of which became popular in releases by an independent company, Rondo Records. A number of other versions were also recorded that year. The recording by Ken Griffin and Jerry Wayne was released by Rondo Records as catalog number 228. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on April 2, 1948 staying at #1 for seven weeks. The instrumental recording by Ken Griffin was released by Rondo Records as catalog number 128. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on July 2, 1948 peaking at #2. Both the vocal and solo organ versions charted for 23 weeks and sold an estimated 3,500,000 copies. Note that this version was recorded and released first, but charted after the vocal version. Renditions A number of other versions were also recorded in 1948. The recording by Dick Haymes with The Song Spinners was released by Decca Records as catalog number 24439. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on May 28, 1948, and lasted 13 weeks on the chart, peaking at #9. Both sides of this recording were cover versions of bigger hits, but both charted; the flip side was \\"Nature Boy\\", a major hit for Nat King Cole. The recording by The Sportsmen was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 15077. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on May 28, 1948, and lasted 13 weeks on the chart, peaking at #11. The flip side, \\"Toolie Oolie Doolie,\\" also charted. The recording by The Marlin Sisters was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 38211. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on June 4, 1948, and lasted 4 weeks on the chart, peaking at #19. The flip side, \\"Toolie Oolie Doolie,\\" also charted (oddly enough, in both The Sportsmen's and the Marlin Sisters' version, the same song was the flip side and in both cases, both sides made the charts). The recording by Dick James was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-2944. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on June 25, 1948, and lasted 2 weeks on the chart, peaking at #19. This was his only charting hit. Two artists in the United Kingdom also recorded the song at about the same time. Vera Lynn recorded the song on March 10, 1948, which was released by the UK Decca label under catalog number F-8883, and Dolores Gray made a recording on August 13, 1948, released by the UK Columbia label under catalog number DB 2451. Vera Lynn's recording also charted in the United States. This recording was released by London Records as catalog number 202. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on May 21, 1948, and lasted 7 weeks on the chart, peaking at #14. A revival of the song by Patti Page (Columbia Records catalog number 4-44345) became popular in 1965, spending 8 weeks on the Billboard Easy listening music chart, peaking at #11.

The name is an homage to Valentino's character, ShadowHawk. History Shadowline was officially created in December 1992 when the logo first appeared on the inside front cover of Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #3. The first book to sport the logo on its cover was Shadowline Special #1 (October, 1994). In January 1997, Shadowline became more commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúNon-Line‚Äù with the publication of A Touch of Silver #1. The name referred to the fact that the comics in the line at that time were not in any way aligned with one another. There was no singular universe or line. Hence, non-line. On August 25, 1999 Jim Valentino became the publisher of Image Comics and while he did not publish his own work (so as not to create a conflict of interest), other books in the Non-Line continued. When Erik Larsen eventually took over as the publisher, Valentino returned to the Non- Line and to publishing his own work. In July, 2004 with the publication of the normalman 20th Anniversary Special, the name Shadowline was reborn. The first new book to have the Shadowline logo on the cover after the rebirth was Shadowhawk v. II #1 (May, 2005). Other titles to be created by Valentino, but executed by different creative teams were Blacklight, Task Force 1, The Intimidators and Emissary. Today, Shadowline not only publishes Jim Valentino's properties but also properties owned by other creators such as Jimmie Robinson, Ted McKeever, Jeff Mariotte, Mike Mayhhew, Steve Niles and Michael Cavallaro. With a diverse line of one-shots, miniseries and series of miniseries and a growing stable of Eagle- and Eisner-nominated creators, Shadowline is gaining recognition from fans, peers and critics in recent years. Who Wants To Create a Super-Heroine contest In December 2007 Shadowline announced a contest for writers to send in a submission for a three-issue limited series featuring an all-new, creator-owned superheroine. While it was announced in April 2008 that Tom Arguello was declared the winner for his entry, Incredible Journey the book itself eventually did not go to print due to a lack of customer/comic-shop support through pre-orders. However, shortly after ComicCon 2008 it was announced that contest finalist Kat Cahill would have her semi-finalist submission I Hate Gallant Girl published by Shadowline with Seth Damoose as the series artist. Three issues of I Hate Gallant Girl were published between December 2008 and February 2009. Shadowlinecomics.com On June 25, 2008 the Shadowline website was relaunched. In the weeks and months that followed the site became home to a number of webcomics, including Brat-halla, Chicago:1968, Finder and Yenny. Later additions include Hannibal Goes to Rome, Action, Ohio, Platinum Grit, Nightmare World, Li'l Depressed Boy and the Mundane Overrated Misadventures of Spudman. Silverline Books Along with the relaunch of the website in 2008 came the announcement of an all-ages sub-imprint for the company called Silverline Books. Silverline was created as a way to clearly define the all- ages books for easier reference for parents, librarians and others. It was done to assist in allowing anyone to separate those titles from Shadowline's more mature offerings such as Bomb Queen and The Roberts. Among the titles that will see print under the Silverline Books banner are Dear Dracula, Bruce The Little Blue Spruce, Missing the Boat and any future versions of PX!, The Surreal Adventures of Edgar Allan Poo, \\"Timothy and the Transgalactic Towel,\\" \\"Rocketbots,\\" and \\"Night of the Bedbugs.\\" ShadowlineOnline.com In the early part of 2011 the Shadowline website was renamed to ShadowlineOnline and the website was relaunched once again. Along with the relaunch came a new webcomic, The Tales of Mr. Rhee, a spinoff of Dirk Manning's Nightmare World. Additionally, the website also runs a feature every Monday that gives details on any new comics that come out each week and on every Friday there is a 10 Questions interview with a given Shadowline creator. As of August 2016 the website is no longer active. Publications References External links  ","title":"Shadowline"},{"id":"2598394","text":"is a 1990 Japanese film directed by Junji Sakamoto.

He was commissioned by King William IV of the United Kingdom to suppress the slave trade by force off the West Coast of Africa. Background and career Melville was an ethnic Scotsman from Dublin where his family had lived since the middle of the 18th century. He was named after his godfather, the writer Michael Linning, and went on to marry the latter's niece Elizabeth Helen Callender. In September 1818, both of Melville's parents died within a few days of each other. His loss aroused the pity of the Prince Regent who, in November of that year, granted the boy an annual pension from the Civil List.On Financial Reform, Third Edition, by Henry Brooke Parnell, Baron Congleton, published by John Murray, Albemarle Street, London 1832 page 388Journals of the House of Commons, Volume 81 Volume 86, Appendix (E.), Civil List, 2 Decembria continued, Journal, p 143, published The Stationery Office, London 1830 At some stage in the 1820s Meville joined the Foreign Office.

In September 1842 Queen Victoria made Melville a Judge.\\"We have also the honour to acknowledge the receipt of a Commission bearing date 22nd September last, under the Great Seal and Royal Signature wherein Her Majesty has been pleased to appoint Michael Linning Melville, Esquire, to be Her Majesty's Judge\\", letter from the Lieutenant Governor of Sierra Leone, George MacDonald to the Earl of Aberdeen in \\"Correspondence with the British Commissioners at Sierra Leone, Havana, Rio de Janeiro, Surinam, Cape of Good Hope, Jamaica, Loanda, and Boa Vista Relating to The Slave Trade, from January 1 to December 31, 1844, inclusive\\", London William Clowes and Sons for HMSO, p. 11The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 50, Sylvanus Urban, \\"Gazette Promotions\\" 1841, p. 422 Later that year the Earl of Aberdeen, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, appointed Melville to sit on the Mixed British and Foreign Courts of Commission for the Suppression of the Slave Trade.Letter from Lord Howard de Walden dated 14 October 1842, quoted in General Report of the Emigration Commissioners, Volume 2, , p225 His service in West Africa was to form the basis for his wife's 1849 memoir A Residence in Sierra Leone Described from a Journal Kept on the Spot and from Letters Written to Friends at Home Edited by Mrs. Norton, which was edited by her first cousin Caroline Norton. The book is one of the only surviving accounts of life in mid-Nineteenth Century Africa written from the perspective of a woman and contains descriptions of life and society in early Victorian Freetown and the countryside nearby as well as her husband's work seizing slave ships, prosecuting their crews, and overseeing the breaking up of the vessels at a place called \\"Destruction Bay\\". Melville's own correspondence with Aberdeen contains a number of detailed and vivid descriptions of the struggle to suppress the transatlantic slave trade and release its victims. A letter of 27 April 1844 is typical: \\"The Santa Anna cleared out from Bahia on 24 December last, with slave provisions and equipment, and a small quantity of tobacco and other goods on board, and proceeded direct to Lagos, where she arrived on 5 February, when one of her officers, according to the usual custom, seems to have gone on shore to arrange about a cargo of slaves, the vessel putting to sea again in the meanwhile and cruizing [sic] about to avoid risk of capture. On 5 March, 311 slaves were embarked in this small schooner, which is apparently not more than 35 British tons in burthen. On 4 April, having lost in the interim by death several of her human cargo, she was fallen in with, to the northward of Ascension, by Her Majesty's brig , and, after a chase, captured; most fortunately for the lives as we well as the liberties of the slaves, the quantity of water found on board being very deficient, and barely lasting until the arrival of the vessel at Sierra Leone... No flag nor any official papers were found in the vessel to indicate her nationality; but that difficulty was sufficiently obviated, and the Brazilian character of the vessel, and the traffic in which se was engaged, clearly established by the admissions of the witnesses, and the evidence afforded by two log-books and a list of the cargo of slaves with had been discovered on board; her condemnation consequently took place as above mentioned, the surviving slaves, 267 in number, (one having died here before adjudication), being at the same time emancipated.\\" (M.

At this time in British history, before the publication of the Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan Report, appointment and promotion in the Civil Service depended on aristocratic patronage and Elizabeth's connections (her uncle, Sir James Graham, Bt, was at that time Home Secretary) would have been an immense asset for Melville's careerChristopher Fyfe, A History of Sierra Leone, Oxford University Press, London, 1962, page 216. As described in A Residence in Sierra Leone Michael and Elizabeth Melville had a son Robert Melville (judge, of Hartfield Grove Sussex, and Ashford Hall Shropshire), born in Sierra Leone. They later had a daughter Elizabeth, born in Scotland in 1847, who (married Arthur Champernowne of Dartington Hall, Devon). Michael Linning Melville and his wife Elizabeth both died in 1876 and are buried in the old churchyard at Dartington Hall in South Devon, England.

The station is south of Manchester Piccadilly, situated at the end of a short branch from the Styal Line which is accessed via a triangular junction between Heald Green and Styal stations. Manchester Metrolink tram services were extended to the airport in November 2014 and operate to Manchester Victoria. Description The station is south of at the end of a short branch from the Styal Line constructed by British Rail in 1993. A branch of Manchester Metrolink runs into it. It is accessed via a triangular junction located between and . The station platforms are connected by escalator, lift, ramps and an elevated covered walkway (known as the \\"Sky Link\\") to the airport terminal buildings in which is a manned railway ticket office. Throughout the airport complex, the railway station is known as \\"The Station\\" and is signposted as such.  History  =New platforms= In December 2008, a third platform opened after a year of construction and a total cost of ¬£15 million. The following year Network Rail noted that it had \\"greatly increased operational flexibility at the station, and reduced the number of times that late-running trains had had to be terminated at Manchester Piccadilly.\\"Connecting local communities: Route Plan 2009 for Route 20 - North West Urban , Network Rail, 2009; page 6 In 2009, Network Rail stated that the creation of the third platform has meant that the capacity at Manchester Airport will become constrained by the layover of the trains and congestion at the throat. To solve this issue they have recommended building a line underneath the airport towards Northwich in the 2019 to 2024 period.Connecting local communities: Route Plan 2009 for Route 20 - North West Urban , Network Rail, 2009; page 27 In July 2012, support for a fourth railway platform was announced by the Government.Historic day for Greater Manchester's rail network , Transport for Greater Manchester, 16 July 2012 The current platforms are eight carriage lengths long, so each can accommodate two trains of four carriages. A fourth platform will allow greater use of longer trains of six carriages or more. This had been recommended as part of the Northern Hub scheme of rail improvements around Manchester by the 2010 Manchester Hub Rail Study and the 2011 Northern Route Utilisation Strategy, with an estimated cost of ¬£23 million.Manchester Hub Rail Study, Network Rail, February 2010 Northern Route Utilisation Strategy, Network Rail, May 2011, page 7 and pp. 55-56 In February 2014, construction commenced on a new ¬£20m fourth platform at the station. The start of construction was attended by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. Construction of the new platform was completed in May 2015 - three years earlier than the 2018 estimate given in 2012. This was to allow engineering work to overlap with that being done on the Manchester Metrolink extension to the airport (see below) so that the fourth platform could be used for the extra traffic generated by the Ordsall Chord (opened 10 December 2017), while the fourth platform itself opened to passengers in Autumn 2015. =HS2= In January 2013, the Government announced that Manchester Airport would be included in the second phase of the High Speed 2 railway line. This will enable Manchester Airport to be reached from London Euston in 59 minutes. The new line and associated new station will pass to the west of the Airport, away from the existing railway station and transport interchange, giving the airport two disconnected railways stations approximately 1 mile apart.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69079/hs2-msg- ma0-zz-dr-rt-52805.pdf The proposed Manchester Interchange Station National Rail services TransPennine Express Class 185 on platform 2 (was 1a) arriving from Map showing heavy rail and Metrolink access to the airport Northern, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales are the three current franchise holders that serve Manchester Airport.

There is a frequent service from the airport to Manchester Piccadilly. Services also operate during the night to Manchester Piccadilly and beyond including ; ; ; ; Scotland and . There are currently nine trains per hour to Manchester Piccadilly. There are no long distance services to the airport from the south; a Central Trains service from Manchester Airport to via was cut back to in 2003, there was also Virgin Crosscountry services from Birmingham New Street to Edinburgh or Glasgow, the Birmingham Services were cut in 2003 and the Scotland services were transferred to TransPennine Express in 2007. In May 2016, Arriva Trains Wales began operating an hourly (off peak) Monday - Saturday service to Llandudno via Chester. It now operates 57 services a week compared to the previous 17. First TransPennine Express previously ran the service to Blackpool North but this was passed on to the new Northern franchise in April 2016. It was planned that infrastructure developments that are part of the Northern Hub system of schemes such as the Ordsall Chord should enable direct trains to and on towards Bradford from May 2019. However the introduction of the May 2018 timetable, one of the most radical in decades, caused punctuality through Manchester to drop sharply and it became common for TransPennine Express to terminate delayed services at Manchester Piccadilly or Victoria rather than continue onto the final destination at Manchester Airport. Any future additional services to the Airport are in doubt without further infrastructure works; unresolved issues surround the lack of new 'through' platforms at Manchester Piccadilly which have been shelved by the government and the Styal Line to Manchester Airport operating at full capacity with little resilience to absorb delays. Manchester Metrolink The Manchester Metrolink light rail network was extended from St Werburgh's Road to Manchester Airport as part of the Phase 3 expansion project. \\\\- map of the proposed network expansion The Metrolink station has been built adjacent to the airport station. It is the terminus of the Airport Line. Following a period of uncertainty due to funding problems, the plans were finally given the go-ahead in May 2009. The confirmed route would not complete the full airport loop as proposed, but trams would run along the northern route via Wythenshawe. Completion of the western side of the loop is subject to further funding in a later project. An opening date of Summer 2016 had originally been indicated for opening of the Airport line but the line opened early on 3 November 2014. =Services= Trams run between Manchester Airport and Victoria every 12 minutes. An early morning service runs from 03:19‚Äì06:00 am every 20 minutes. = Ticket zones = With the introduction to a zonal ticketing system on Metrolink services in January 2019, Manchester Airport is located within zone 4.

Its members live in several countries around the world. PGO's members' efforts are mostly undertaken via the internet. On their website, current news about the Persian Gulf, maps, articles, bibliographies about the Persian Gulf, conferences, and other information can be found.

PGO has sent similar letters to the Army News, and also had struggled with National Geographic about the naming of the gulf. After that, the Government of Iran became involved in this too, and Iranian government agents in Europe and US contacted National Geographic, wanting to use the same name of the Persian Gulf according to its history. In October 2018, the WIPO as an agency of the UN registers Persian Gulf in official certificate based on the Lisbon Agreement. According to this agreement based on international law, no country, government, or organization can use another name to refer to the Persian Gulf.

Both versions became popular, selling over 3.5 million copies. He also starred in a 1954-55 syndicated television series, 67 Melody Lane. He recorded on a variety of recording labels, especially Columbia. It was in the 1940s in Aurora, Illinois, that Griffin broke into the nightclub circuit, playing at the Rivoli Cafe nightly. The sessions at the Rivoli cafe were broadcast on the radio station, WMRO, and the program became popular. Griffin died on March 11, 1956 in Chicago, Illinois at the age of 46, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape, and continued to release \\"new\\" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

The word was coined by Johann Eduard Erdmann as Psychologismus, being translated into English as psychologism.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Psychologism.Kusch, M., Psychologism: The Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge (London & New York: Routledge, 1995), p. 101.  Definition  The Oxford English Dictionary defines psychologism as: \\"The view or doctrine that a theory of psychology or ideas forms the basis of an account of metaphysics, epistemology, or meaning; (sometimes) spec. the explanation or derivation of mathematical or logical laws in terms of psychological facts.\\"Oxford English Dictionary. Psychologism in epistemology, the idea that its problems \\"can be solved satisfactorily by the psychological study of the development of mental processes\\", was argued in John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690).Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Psychologism. Other forms of psychologism are logical psychologism and mathematical psychologism. Logical psychologism is a position in logic (or the philosophy of logic) according to which logical laws and mathematical laws are grounded in, derived from, explained or exhausted by psychological facts or laws. Psychologism in the philosophy of mathematics is the position that mathematical concepts and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts or laws.Gallagher, S., Phenomenology (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 20.  Viewpoints  John Stuart Mill was accused by Edmund Husserl of being an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, although this may not have been the case.Skorupski, JM., Mill (Arguments of the Philosophers), Routledge, 2010, pp. 127-128. So were many nineteenth-century German philosophers such as Christoph von Sigwart, Benno Erdmann, Theodor Lipps, Gerardus Heymans, Wilhelm Jerusalem, and , as well as a number of psychologists, past and present (e.g., Wilhelm Wundt and Gustave Le Bon).Szacki, J., History of Sociological Thought, Greenwood Press, 1979, p. 252. Psychologism was notably criticized by Gottlob Frege in his anti- psychologistic work The Foundations of Arithmetic, and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl's Philosophy of Arithmetic.Haddock, G. E. R., A Critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Gottlob Frege (London and New York: Routledge, 2006), p. 110. Husserl, in the first volume of his Logical Investigations, called \\"The Prolegomena of Pure Logic\\", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. Frege's arguments were largely ignored, while Husserl's were widely discussed. In \\"Psychologism and Behaviorism\\", Ned Block describes psychologism in the philosophy of mind as the view that \\"whether behavior is intelligent behavior depends on the character of the internal information processing that produces it.\\" This is in contrast to a behavioral view which would state that intelligence can be ascribed to a being solely via observing its behavior. This latter type of behavioral view is strongly associated with the Turing test.Moor, J. H., ed., The Turing Test: The Elusive Standard of Artificial Intelligence (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003).

He was best known for his role as Tito Suarez in the film Dirty Dancing. Life and career Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Coles developed his high-speed rhythm tapping on the streets of his hometown. He first went to New York City as one of the Three Millers, who were known for their intricate and difficult dance steps executed on tiny platforms. He later returned to headline at the Apollo Theater. In 1940, while dancing with Cab Calloway's band, he met and teamed with Charles \\"Cholly\\" Atkins. As Coles & Atkins, their routine opened with a fast-paced song and tap number, followed by a precision swing dance, a soft shoe, and a tap-challenge. Their partnership lasted nineteen years. Coles placed tap in the world of concert art when he performed in the Joffrey Ballet's production of Agnes de Mille's Conversations about the Dance. Coles made his Broadway debut in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in 1949. He also appeared in Bubbling Brown Sugar and My One and Only, for which he received both the Tony and Drama Desk Award for his performance. During the 1980s, Coles taught dance and dance history at Yale, Cornell, Duke, and George Washington University. Coles was a close associate of tap dancer Brenda Bufalino, who was instrumental in helping him rebuild his career in the early 1970s. The American Tap Dance Orchestra was and founded by Bufalino along with Tony Waag Coles in 1986 as a tax exempt 501c3 charitable organization. During that time the Orchestra performed in hundreds of concert, stage, and film projects and thrilled audiences around the world. From 1989 to 1995, the company also operated Woodpeckers Tap Dance Center in New York City, and presented on-going classes, performances and related activities. Coles also had a part in the 1987 hit movie Dirty Dancing. In 1991, Coles was awarded the National Medal of Arts by president George H.W. Bush. Charles Honi Coles died from cancer on November 12, 1992. He was inducted, posthumously, into the Tap Dance Hall of Fame in 2003. His wife Marion Edwards Coles died on November 6, 2009. While he was performing \\"My One and Only\\" Charles had a stroke.

An interdisciplinary electronic rulemaking research community has formed as a result of National Science Foundation funding under the auspices of the Digital Government Program. Groups such as the Cornell E-Rulemaking Initiative (CeRI) have been focused on researching how technologies such as Web 2.0 can help foster greater public participation in the political process, specifically, in Federal Agencies‚Äô rulemaking. Background In the United States, Electronic rulemaking (also known as eRulemaking and e-rulemaking) can be understood as a subset of a larger Federal eGovernment initiative. In the 1990s Federal Agencies that propose and enact regulations, such as the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC), began to modernize and create websites for publication of proposed regulations and online commenting from the public. President George W. Bush made strides in increasing e-Government. Under President Bush, Congress passed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which among other things, required agencies to accept comments electronically and make various information, including comments and rulemaking materials, publicly available online. Since 2008, President Barack Obama has greatly increased the number of Federal eGovernment initiatives. 2009 initiatives and reforms In 2009, President Barack Obama directed government agencies to utilize new technologies such as Web 2.0 and other information technology to increase transparency and openness in government. Soon after, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum to the Federal Agencies reiterating three open government principles, ‚Äútransparency, participation, and collaboration,‚Äù identified by the President. OMB gave agencies four months to create an ‚Äúopen government plan,‚Äù which would address each ‚Äúcornerstone‚Äù of open government. OMB gave details on how to address each cornerstone. For ‚Äútransparency,‚Äù the agencies were required to publish ‚Äúhigh- value‚Äù data and other information in an ‚Äúopen‚Äù format, and ‚Äúinform the public of significant actions and business of [the] agency.‚Äù To address ‚Äúparticipation,‚Äù agencies were required to openly link to sites where the public could ‚Äúactively participate,‚Äù and to ‚Äúinclude proposals for new feedback mechanisms, including innovative tools and practices that create new and easier methods for public engagement.‚Äù Finally, to address ‚Äúcollaboration,‚Äù agencies were required to ‚Äúinclude proposals to use technology platforms to improve collaboration among people within and outside your agency,‚Äù and use innovative methods to increase collaboration. In addition to addressing the ‚Äúcornerstones,‚Äù agencies were required to identify a ‚Äúflagship initiative.‚Äù The flagship initiative had to be ‚Äúat least one specific, new transparency, participation, or collaboration initiative that your agency is currently implementing (or that will be implemented before the next update of the Open Government Plan).‚Äù Third party e-rulemaking initiatives =Cornell e-Rulemaking Initiative= Cornell University has started a multidisciplinary collaboration known as the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative, or CeRI. Backed by a National Science Foundation grant, CeRI has begun researching and applying Web 2.0 technologies in a political setting. The group includes faculty and students from Computing and Information Science, Law, and the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution. CeRI uses an interdisciplinary approach to discover and apply Web 2.0 and other technologies to ‚Äúimprove public understanding of, and participation in, rulemaking.‚Äù In 2009, CeRI launched the site RegulationRoom.org. The site, which is hosted by the Legal Information Institute, is an independent non- governmental online community that allows users to read, comment, and discuss proposed regulations from federal agencies. Professors and students at Cornell Law School summarize the relevant parts of the agency‚Äôs proposed regulation, and post the information on the site. Once the proposed rule has been posted, users are able to comment, discuss, and critique the agency‚Äôs proposal. At the close of a rule‚Äôs comment period, Regulation Room moderators summarize the comments and submit this summary to the Agency as an official comment. Although CeRI and Regulation Room are research projects unaffiliated with the federal government, In 2010, the DOT partnered with CeRI as part of the White House Open Government Initiative. The purpose of the partnership is to ‚Äúdiscover the best ways of using Web 2.0 and social networking technologies to further rulemaking efforts.‚Äù DOT has selected Regulation Room as its flagship initiative under the Open Government Directive. Similar open government initiatives have been launched at other federal agencies. Since launching in 2009, RegulationRoom.org has hosted four ‚Äúlive‚Äù rules from the DOT. These rules included: *DOT ‚Äì Texting: The rule, which closed to commenting on January 10, 2010, dealt with the DOT‚Äôs proposal to regulate texting by commercial motor vehicle operators. The rule received 48 comments on Regulation Room. * DOT - Airline Passenger Rights: The rule, which closed on September 23, 2010, dealt with the DOT‚Äôs proposed regulations for airline passenger rights. Regulation room received over 19,000 visitors and over 900 comments. * DOT - Electronic Onboard Recorders: The rule, which closed on May 23, 2011, was a proposal to require commercial truck drivers with multiple operating violations to use electronic onboard recorders. The rule received over one-hundred comments. * DOT ‚Äì Air Travel Accessibility: The rule, which closed on January 9, 2012, was a proposal to require airlines to make their websites and airport kiosks accessible to travelers with disabilities.

It started broadcasting in 1999 as a dedicated news channel. In 2003 it extended its scope to include other current events-related programmes and sports at the weekend. Nowadays the channel mainly consists of news, sports and entertainment programmes with a focus on reruns from SVT1 and SVT2. History On 15 March 1999 at 13:15 the broadcasting of SVT24 started. It started with a news summary followed by an official opening by the CEO of SVT. In the beginning, SVT24 simulcasted with other channels a lot of the time, first on SVT2 and in the summer on SVT1. SVT24 got to take care of extended broadcasts in case of special events. The channel broadcast news every fifteen minutes throughout the weekday. However, there were no broadcasts in the weekends and the nightly broadcasts started some months later. At :00 and :30 SVT24 showed longer bulletins, but the :15 and :45 broadcasts were just news summaries. The channel also broadcast economic news twice every hour, many weather forecasts, reports from the Nordic countries and other featured stories. The material was mostly picked up from other news programmes. SVT24 used digital technology for broadcasting, so a bulletin from SVT24 was much cheaper to broadcast than a bulletin from Rapport or Aktuellt. That's why during 1999 and 2000 SVT24 took over all the short bulletins from Rapport and the morning programme was moved to the SVT24 studio. In 2000 SVT24 merged with Rapport and Aktuellt into one central newsdesk. After some time, the channel was hit by cost savings. All broadcasts between 09:30 and 16:00 ceased for some time and the economic news disappeared. On 8 September 2001, Aktuellt and Rapport moved to a new common studio and got a graphical make-over. That meant that all bulletins in SVT1 got the Rapport brand, making SVT24 only broadcasting digitally (and on SVT1 in the nights). SVT24 moved into the common studio a week later. In the end of 2002 SVT declared that they were going to launch two new channels. That meant that SVT24 was about to be merged with SVT Extra into a new channel, called only 24. 24 would include a wider range of programmes than SVT24 did, also including acquired programming, sports events and weekend broadcasts. The new channel was launched on 24 February 2003. It consisted of short three-minute bulletins from Rapport every half-hour. Between these many different programs were shown. In the day-time this consisted of 24 Direkt (\\"24 Live\\", Swedish version of C-SPAN), 24 M√•ndag- Fredag (\\"24 Monday-Friday\\") and reruns of the evening programmes. The prime time show at 20:00 was 24 minuter (\\"24 minutes\\"), a daily chat show hosted by Claes Elfsberg. Other prime time shows included 24 N√∂je (\\"24 Entertainment\\"), 24 Konsument (\\"24 Consumer\\"), Sverige Nu (\\"Sweden Now\\") and acquired programming such as Saturday Night Live, documentaries and World News from BBC World. During the weekends, the \\"interactive news service\\" 24 Vision and sport events where shown. In the autumn of 2003 the channel was hit by cost savings. The short bulletins were now only shown every hour in the daytime and 24 Direkt started occupying the rest of the day-time schedule. New shows included a taped radio show, Lantz i P3. In 2004 the acquired programming and BBC World disappeared. 24 Konsument and 24 N√∂je were however transformed into daily newscasts and sport bulletins were included in the evening. In 2005, the simulcasts of Rapport at 19:30 and Aktuellt at 18:00 and 21:00 ended and were replaced by mostly reruns of current affairs-based programmes from SVT1 and SVT2. 24 Konsument was axed in late 2005 and in 2006 24 N√∂je rebranded as N√∂jesnytt with bulletins on both SVT1 (in the morning) and SVT2 (in the evening). On 1 July 2005 SVT24, along with SVT Barnkanalen and Kunskapskanalen became must-carry channels and SVT and UR subsequently agreed to let the said channels be distributed on UPC Sweden and Com Hem cable television systems in their basic analogue range. The ratings for the channel had been very modest from the start. 2006 did however mean a significant increase in the viewing. For the full year of 2005 the average Swede watched SVT24 for 0.7 minutes per day. For the month of November 2006 this had doubled to 1.4 minutes. The next month, December 2006, the rating doubled once again, averaging 2.8 minutes per day and viewer, for the first time making SVT24 one of the ten most watched channels in Sweden. (Source: Mediam√§tning i Skandinavien) In December 2006, the daily current affairs show Studio 24 got axed because of budget cuts at the SVT news department. Sverige Nu was also axed. The channel relaunched in January 2007. The new evening schedule mainly consists of reruns of programmes from SVT1 and SVT2 and a half-hour news bulletin from Rapport with N√∂jesnytt at 21:30. 24 Direkt, the sports broadcasts and news updates were retained. On 18 January 2010 Kunskapskanalen began sharing channel space with SVT24 and SVT Barnkanalen, and at the same time 24 Direkt was renamed SVT Forum and shifted to Kunskapskanalen. Under the current arrangement SVT24 is aired from 20:00 until 05:00 the next day, with SVT Barnkanalen and Kunskapskanalen occupying the morning, afternoon and early-evening slots. On 25 November 2013 SVT announced its intention to launch a high-definition (HD) simulcast of SVT24. Name The channel started out as SVT24, and as SVT 24 on 8 September 2001, but was renamed 24 in 2003. This name was however hard to use, so variants such as 24:an (\\"the 24\\") occurred along with the old name. About a year later the name SVT24 started to appear in EPGs and programme schedules.

Distribution The channel is broadcast free-to-air in the digital terrestrial television network in Sweden and √Öland. Satellite transmissions are from the Thor and Sirius satellites, but are encrypted. A decoding card from Viasat or Canal Digital is needed to view the channel. The two largest cable networks (Com Hem and UPC) broadcast the analogue version of the channel.

Plays Indiana has written, directed and acted in a dozen plays, mostly during the early 1980s. Performed in small New York City venues like Mudd Club, Club 57, the Performing Garage and the backyard of Bill Rice's East 3rd Street studio, the earlier plays included Alligator Girls Go to College (1979); Curse of the Dog People (1980); A Coupla White Faggots Sitting Around Talking (1980), which was filmed by Michel Auder in 1981; The Roman Polanski Story (1981); Phantoms of Louisiana (1981) and Roy Cohn/Jack Smith (1992), written with Jack Smith for performance artist Ron Vawter. The latter was filmed in 1994 by Jill Godmilow. A more recent play, Mrs. Watson's Missing Parts, was staged in May 2013 at Participant Inc. It drastically alters a 1922 Grand Guignol theatrical adaptation of Octave Mirbeau's novel The Torture Garden by replacing all dialogue with an \\"almost incomprehensible\\" obscenity-laden libidinal glossolalia. Film Indiana has acted in several mostly experimental films by, among others, Michel Auder (Seduction of Patrick, 1979, which he co-wrote with the director), Scott B and Beth B (The Trap Door, 1980), Melvie Arslanian (Stiletto, 1981, where he plays a bellhop at the bellhopless Chelsea Hotel), Jackie Raynal (Hotel New York, 1984), Ulrike Ottinger (Dorian Gray im Spiegel der Boulevardpresse, 1984, with Veruschka as Dorian Gray and Delphine Seyrig as Doctor Mabuse), Lothar Lambert (Fr√§ulein Berlin, 1984), Dieter Schidor (Cold in Columbia, 1985), Valie Export (The Practice of Love, 1985) and Christoph Schlingensief (Terror 2000: Intensivstation Deutschland, 1994, in which Udo Kier kills his character with a machine gun). John Boskovich‚Äôs 2001 film North features Indiana reading from the C√©line novel of the same name. Indiana's novel Gone Tomorrow reflects his experiences on set, particularly his time working on Cold in Columbia. Art Indiana's video Stanley Park (2013) was included in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. Combining footage of a former Cuban prison, the Panopticon-like Presidio Modelo, jellyfish and cuts from the films A Touch of Evil and The Shanghai Gesture, the work connects the consequences of global environmental degradation with increasingly repressive governmental practices. Used as a metaphor for state surveillance, the jellyfish was described by Indiana as ‚Äúan organism with no brain and a thousand poisonous tentacles collecting what you could call data.‚Äù Photographs of young Cuban men appeared next to the video. Semiotext(e) published 22 pamphlets for the biennial, including Indiana's A Significant Loss of Human Life, which extends the video's themes by juxtaposing the artist's experiences of Cuba as it is slowly being drawn into the global economy with commentary on the ideas of Karl Marx. In addition to Stanley Park, publicly screened video art by Indiana includes Soap (2004‚Äì2012), inspired by the Francis Ponge poem; Plutot la vie (2005), concerning the Society of the Spectacle and mass hypnosis; Unfinished Story (2004‚Äì2005), which records readings by and conversations between Indiana and photographer Lynn Davis; and Young Ginger (2014) Bibliography =Fiction= * (1987) Scar Tissue and Other Stories * (1988) White Trash Boulevard * (1989) Horse Crazy * (1991) Disorderly Conduct: The VLS Fiction Reader (contributor) * (1993) Gone Tomorrow * (1994) Rent Boy * (1994) Living With the Animals (editor, contributor) * (1997) Resentment: A Comedy * (1999) Three Month Fever: The Andrew Cunanan Story * (2002) Depraved Indifference * (2003) Do Everything in the Dark * (2009) The Shanghai Gesture * (2010) Last Seen Entering the Biltmore: Plays, Short Fiction, Poems 1975‚Äì2010 * (2011) To Whom It May Concern (limited edition artist's book with Louise Bourgeois) * (2016) Tiny Fish that Only Want to Kiss =Nonfiction= * (1987) Lucas Samaras: Chairs and Drawings (for Pace Gallery) * (1987) Roberto Juarez (for Robert Miller Gallery) * (1989) Life Under Neon: Paintings and Drawings of Times Square 1981‚Äì1988 (Jane Dickson catalogue for Goldie Paley Gallery, Moore College of Art and Design;

The first expedition was in 1965 and they have gone somewhere every year after that, apart from 1986 and 2011. The Summer Expedition was traditionally announced on the last programme of the series which is usually towards the end of June. From 1971, the highlights of the expedition were shown as special programmes the following summer under the title Blue Peter Flies The World. In 2012, with the series being broadcast all year round, the summer expedition was changed. It has been renamed the \\"Blue Peter Road Trip\\" and had purpose for going to a country(s). For the 2012 road trip, the presenters visited Poland and Ukraine because of the Euro 2012 games. The road trip was filmed over the course of one or two weeks. These would then be made as films for the live show and special programmes as usual. The expedition was abandoned after 2012.

The line ran along the former Norfolk Southern right of way between Tremont Avenue in the Historic South End in a northerly direction to its terminus at 9th Street Uptown. It ran on tracks mostly shared with the LYNX Blue Line. History The Charlotte Trolley represented the return of streetcar service to the city of Charlotte since the closure of its original network on March 14, 1938, which had been in operation since May 18, 1891. The return of the trolley came on August 30, 1996, running in the evenings on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons for an initial six-month trial period. The trial period occurred on a 1.8-mile rail line between the Atherton Mill trolley barn and Stonewall Street. Through the initial six months of operation ending on February 28, 1997, the trolley saw a ridership of 25,000. As a result of the success of the trial run of the trolley, Norfolk Southern awarded the trolley a one-year extension of the agreement to use its track. After a new bridge was completed over Stonewall Street, 7-day-a-week service commenced between Atherton Mill in the South End and 9th Street Uptown on June 28, 2004. Operations prior to that date were run by a group of volunteers (some retirees) where some of them were hired by the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) which has operated the Trolley since that time. At that time, CATS purchased three replica trolleys similar to number 85, an original Charlotte car dating from the 1920s. =Suspension and end of trolley service= Service was temporarily halted on February 5, 2006, when construction began to convert the route into a light rail line. Initially service was to only be halted for a year, with the trolley running approximately a year before light rail service commenced. However, by November 2006 CATS determined it would be unfeasible to run the trolley service with the corridor still under construction. Service resumed on April 20, 2008, with the vintage trolley cars running on the same tracks as the LYNX light rail vehicles. With the opening of the LYNX Blue Line, the Charlotte Trolley ended its daily service. It continued to run on weekends until the service completely ended on June 28, 2010. However, Charlotte Trolley still maintains a trolley museum just outside East/West station. Service stock The line operated three replica streetcars, numbered 91, 92 and 93. They were delivered to Charlotte Trolley from Gomaco Trolley Company in the fall of 2004. Beginning in July 2015, these units were then used to operate Phase 1 of the CityLynx Gold Line between Charlotte Transportation Center and Hawthorne & 5th station, and were withdrawn in June 2019 when Gold Line service was suspended to allow for completion of Phase 2. Non-operating stock =Number 1= Trolley No. 1 was originally built in Philadelphia by J.G. Brill in 1907 for Athens, Greece. The trolley's restoration was complete in 1989 by trolley restorer Bruce Thain of Guilford, Connecticut. =Number 85= Car 85 was the last electric streetcar to run in Charlotte on March 14, 1938. Alexander Garfield Collie, Sr. supervised the drivers when the streetcars were retired. His son, Alexander Garfield Collie, Jr. was driving car 85 for its final run in 1938. In his personal diary, Collie Sr. wrote of the car's final run into the barn. Directing his son, Collie, Jr. to \\"move over,\\" he took the controls of number 85 for its final run. After retirement it was sold for $100, along with all the remaining cars, and remained in obscurity for nearly 50 years before its rediscovery in a Huntersville neighborhood in November 1987. Following the system closure, Charlotte would rely solely on bus transit to serve its citizens until the opening of the Blue Line in 2007. Following its discovery, the Charlotte Historic Landmarks Commission led the charge in its restoration. Its restoration began at SpringFest '89 and was completed in 1991 at a cost of just over $100,000. Fifty-three years later, when car 85 was reintroduced to service, passengers on its first official, public run included a number of Collie's descendants: son Charles Reid Collie, Sr. and wife Louise Briggs Collie, and grandsons John Wayne Collie, Thomas Alexander Collie, and Roy Alan Collie (born after the death of his grandfather, Collie, Sr.) Returning to service in 1996, number 85 served riders through 2006 when service was temporally halted. In March 2007, it was announced that due to safety concerns, it would not be used as part of the historic trolley network after its reopening in 2007. Charlotte Trolley, Inc., which owns the car, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2008 with the City of Charlotte to allow special excursions for it up to twice per year. It is currently housed in CATS' light rail maintenance facility on South Blvd. =Number 117= Asheville 117 was manufactured in 1927 by J.G. Brill and is commonly known as a Birney Safety Car. In the fall of that year, the Carolina Power & Light Company purchased ten of these cars to operate in Asheville, North Carolina. It currently awaits restoration at the Charlotte Trolley Car Barn.
